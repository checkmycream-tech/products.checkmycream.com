      <li>As a Merchant Marine I spend more than half of the year at sea and truly have a need for a good sea sickness relief.</li>

      <li>My son has mild motion sickness.  </li>
      <li>So it probably helps those that have a mild motion sickness problem.  </li>
      <li>Maybe you&#x27;ll be one of the lucky few&lt;br</li>

      <li>I have used this on several occasions and honestly i don&#x27;t know if it works.  </li>
      <li>Another perk is that it&#x27;s applied directly to the skin, so no drowsy side effects that most pills have.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m purchasing the stuff right now</li>
      <li>He put on the psi bands right away</li>
      <li>The product packaging and labels were very clear and directions were easy to follow.  </li>
      <li>Both my wife and I have experienced sea sickness in the past.</li>
      <li>I have also found that it repels gnats &amp; mosquitos pretty well.</li>
      <li>sure enough, it worked!</li>
      <li>I first bought this item at a boat show as I do get motion sickness.  </li>
      <li>It was my first time being out to sea in about 10 years</li>
      <li>and she went to get some hot chocolate,</li>
      <li>My mom and I used this on our most recent vacation and it did the deed.</li>

    <li> I tried this product on an airplane, and while it calmed my stomach, I am sure those around me didn&#x27;t appreciate the strong odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used it, I put it on BEFORE getting on the plane, and washed my hands immediately so the stuff was only behind my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again it worked great, but I wondered if the others around we were bothered by the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it for open-air trips, like boats, but I don&#x27;t use it on a plane, out of consideration of the other passengers.</li>
    <li> I read as many reviews as I could about this product before I purchased it. MotionEaze claimed to be all natural with no side effects.I bought 2 bottles just in case. I barely needed one. Several people on our cruise, who were experiencing motion sickness used this product, and found it to work very well.I used it on the plane, ship, and our excursions. I never experienced motion sickness once. The smell is a bit strong, but other than that, it works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product.  It made me, and the 3 other people I was with, sick.  We used it exactly as directed, and within half an hour we were all nauseous.  We had to wash it off as quickly as possible to stop from being sick before we even set foot on the boat!  I am not 100% sure what made us sick.  It may have been the extremely over power odor or the oil soaking into our systems and actually messing with our equilibrium.  I believe it was probably a combination of both, because while I did feel better after washing it off, I did not feel very good the rest of the day.  Needless to say, I threw it out that evening.</li>
    <li> Me and my husband bought this stuff for my 3 yr old. She gets motion sick in the car just trying to get from home to her doctors office. Knowing this we were very fearful of a 13 hour car drive to NY. This stuff smells absolutely horrible but I am writing about the effectiveness of it not the smell. In the 26 hour car drive, 13 hours one way, my daughter got sick twice. Once going up and once coming back. Both times I think it was actually mine and my husbands fault. We thought of it as regular medicine and applied every four hours or so. It says use as needed but my daughter didn&#x27;t give us much warning. When we applied it at every restroom stop it worked much better. She was much more cheerful. I would use this again for her because I don&#x27;t want to give her pills. If you are worried about the smell use in a well ventilated area and apply with q tips. Otherwise hold your breath and wash your hands after applying.</li>
    <li> Motion Eaze is great when on a cruise or flying in a plane. We just use Motion Eaze and don&#x27;t have to worry about getting sea sick or air sick.  Try it.  It will work for you too. The best stuff we have ever used. Thank you  for this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a local health herbal store to try on my then 2 1/2 year old who has suffered from motion sickness since she was 15 months old.  Her m/s has gotten progressively worse as she gotten older (she&#x27;s four now) and she can&#x27;t even make a five minute to the closest store and back w/out gagging.  She usually gets physically sick after about twenty mins. or more in the car.  We tried this product to see if we could get her to a friend&#x27;s house about an hour away.  She made it thirty mins. before she started vomiting.  We had to turn around and come home b/c she couldn&#x27;t stop being sick, she even got sick while she was asleep.  Her pediatrician says she has a severe problem that needs to be looked at by an ear, nose and throat specialist.  I don&#x27;t know if this product just didn&#x27;t help her b/c of the severity of her sickness or it just doesn&#x27;t work.  But I need to rate it according to the fact that it didn&#x27;t help my daughter.  I have tried it a couple of times since then on shorter trips and she still ends up gagging, even if she doesn&#x27;t actually physically vomit.  So I&#x27;m thinking it doesn&#x27;t work for her and I wish it did, b/c she really can&#x27;t go anywhere w/out being miserable.</li>
    <li> I tried this on my 17 month old daughter who gets carsick even with short trips. The good was that she didn&#x27;t throw up, but she was still was not comfortable and was complaining during the whole car ride. After a short stop, she was reluctant to get back in the car.    Edit: After increasing the dosage to 2 drops per ear it now seems to work good with my daughter! No more vomiting and no more complaints when she rides the car!</li>
    <li> I thought I would try Motion Eaze since it was all natural, and doesn&#x27;t interact with other meds. It took the edge off for me. I didn&#x27;t actually have to throw up, though I felt as if I would. It was so-so for the general bus ride, UNTIL the bus started making sudden stops like in NYC traffic, and at the tolls.  Then I&#x27;m sure I turned green, started sweating, had to blow cold air on me. So it probably helps those that have a mild motion sickness problem.  If I were you, I would bring along the Bonine/Dramamine just in case.  Wish I had!</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I have experienced sea sickness in the past. My wife was very very sick a few cruises ago and that makes for an very unpleasant trip for everyone. This product along with some other homeopathic help kept both of us feeling well. We were at sea a day longer than scheduled because of a hurricane yet we remained well.</li>
    <li> I am responsible for the operation of an eco tour dolphin watch boat, HOKU NAI&#x27;A, off the Waianae Coast of Oahu in Hawaii.  My trip manager will not leave the pier without MotionEaze.  He uses it to help passengers who feel a bit queezy once we are out at sea looking for the dolphins.  Its&#x27; the only product that we have ever found, in thirty years of doing this, that works after people already feel queezy.  Most other products are just one more foreign object in their tummy by that time, but this one is applied externally and so doesn&#x27;t have that problem, and it is effective for about 90% of the people we apply it to. Please do keep this product available for us.    Thanks.</li>
    <li> really works n my motion sickness</li>
    <li> I have extremely bad motion sickness.  Tried using pills, patches, etc., but nothing seemed to work as well as Motioneaze.  I keep it with me all the time.</li>
    <li> This stuff dont work.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this to take with us on a cruise . I ended up using it before I even printed out the tickets. I mowed the lawn and forgot my sunscreen and ended up with mild symptoms of Sun Poisoning. I put a dot of oil behind each ear , and a few mins later I wasn&#x27;t dizzy anymore. I only had to apply it once , and was able to get back to life and deal with my bad sunburn.</li>
    <li> Yep, this stuff works. Smells AWFUL but does the trick. Its a must for road trips for the whole family.</li>
    <li> I first bought this item at a boat show as I do get motion sickness.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> My son has mild motion sickness.  He applies when we go to a theme parks, on airplane and boat rides. When we visited Germany, he also applied it behind his ear to tolerate the train motion.  Great product that goes on topically.  Moms like that- unlike Dramamin. I would recommend it to all who have motion sickness. It does have a herbal smell to it, but we find it pleasing.</li>
    <li> Tried MotionEaze for a 1-hr bus trip. Applied it on my 9-yr old and me&lt;br /&gt;following the intructions that came with it. It did not help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave MotionEaze another try on a 2-hr plane trip for my 9-yr old and me.&lt;br /&gt;We both still felt dizzy and had that tummy discomfort of feeling like&lt;br /&gt;throwing up. Then finally, my 9-yr old did throw up. The plane trip&lt;br /&gt;was a little turbulent, but that is exactly what I expected MotionEaze to&lt;br /&gt;help with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought Bonine for myself and it was absolutely helpful on our cruise.&lt;br /&gt;We also took a 45-minute ferry ride and you could really feel the boat&lt;br /&gt;movements a lot. That normally triggered motion-sickness for me,&lt;br /&gt;but with Bonine, no problem whatsoever. One side-effect though is that&lt;br /&gt;Bonine initially made me a bit sleepy, but just a little bit and for&lt;br /&gt;only a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottomline, if you can take Bonine, do it. If not, cross your fingers&lt;br /&gt;and try MotionEaze or a sea band. Maybe you&#x27;ll be one of the lucky few&lt;br /&gt;which gets some benefit from it.</li>
    <li> These drops didn&#x27;t help our motion sickness when we look a 3 day cruise.  We also tried them on the long drive home, and they still weren&#x27;t helpful.  We did much better with Bonine.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! My wife is extremely sensitive to motion. We are able to take cruises thanks to Motion Eaze. I have seen her turn from &#x27;green&#x27; to clear eyed in 60 seconds!</li>
    <li> My husband and I have used this product for many years.  He is a private pilot and we fly constantly and putting this behind your ears in turbulence relieves motion sickness.  I got this for my daughter who has twin baby girls - one of them gets car sick and putting this behind her ears while driving in the car relieved the problem.  She recommended it to her pediatrician.</li>
    <li> Not only did my son throw up on the airplane after using this, he also had a bumpy rash where I applied it behind his ears.</li>
    <li> Great for calming nerves and tummies</li>
    <li> Motion Ease absolutely delivers on what it promises.  We cruised the Florida Keys and Mexico with no problems at all.  I used it from the minute I stepped on board the ship, but my husband who was only feeling a bit queasy one day, put it on and in less than 5 minutes was feeling 100% OK.  I would highly recommend this product especially because it&#x27;s safe for all ages and since it&#x27;s not ingested, you don&#x27;t have to worry about interactions with other medications.</li>
    <li> Quest Products sent us two bottles that were leaking and 1/4 empty.  For such an expensive product, this is not acceptable.  the Motionease is great, however.</li>
    <li> Yes, the scent is strong, but it works and you don&#x27;t have to worry about drowsiness or taking it beforehand! My mom and I used this on our most recent vacation and it did the deed. All you need is a small amount behind the ear. My only complaint is that when it arrived, some of the oil had already spilled out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> The product worked as advertised. Two drops behind each ear, rubbed in 5-10 minutes before the trip did the trick. There was no motion sickness at all during the long trip. The only issue I have is how the liquid is dispensed. It is difficult to see the clear liquid and you have to tap the bottle to start the flow. Most of the time, I got more drops than needed. Otherwise, Motioneaze is going with us on each trip!</li>
    <li> Used this on a recent road trip as a preventative for carsickness. Love the smell, very soothing. Used it on my 4.5 and 1.5 year old too. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> My son got sick on a cruise when we hit rough waters, made him sick the rest of the week on the cruise (even when water was calm again). He threw up about 10 times, thought maybe it was from eating too much rich food, but when it wouldn&#x27;t stop tried dromamine- helped just a little, but he still felt horrible. Went to the gift shop- the guy recommended motioneaze, even told me he would give me my $ back if it didn&#x27;t work..... sure enough, it worked! The first time applying it, it took about 15 minutes to make him feel better, then whenever he started feeling a little queezy we put more on and he was better in minutes! (probably had to put it on 3-4 times each day). Worth its weight in gold!!!!!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t help me, but smelled good. I offered it to another sufferer seated behind me on a flight from Phoenix- it seemed to help her a bit. I wish this would have worked for me.</li>
    <li> Just back from a 7 day cruise. My friend and I used Motioneaze everyday and it worked great.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Great service</li>
    <li> So my husband and I were going on a cruise for the first time for our anniversary, and while we were really excited, my husband was a little nervous about getting motion sick. You have to understand my husband gets motion sick in a car, on a boat, on a treadmill, on a plane, on the Indiana Jones ride in Disneyland! I ordered a bunch of stuff. He tried these drops once but the solution itself smells bad. Its like a weird herbal smell... He put on the psi bands right away so we dont really know how effective the drops were. The Psi Bands, and Sea Bands worked better for him.</li>
    <li> It seems to work well when I&#x27;m feeling a little dizzy. It&#x27;s strong scent is okay for me.&lt;br /&gt;The real test will come when I use it on the cruise....to be continued ;)</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! My poor 5 year old could finally go on field trips with summer camp, only to find out he gets car sick. The wrist bands didn&#x27;t help at all. I ordered this product in desperation, and it worked perfectly! He made it to the muse and back without even a hint of sickness. A teacher was so impressed she tried it too and was pleased with the result. We&#x27;ll never travel without Motion Eaze again.</li>
    <li> Got this to try for my vertigo since nothing else worked. It didn&#x27;t either.Don&#x27;t waste your money.Might be good for nausea if vomiting which I didn&#x27;t have,but,does NOT work for dizziness. Very pungent order.</li>
    <li> I have menierre&#x27;s disorder. This stuff does help a lot. I have also found that it repels gnats &amp; mosquitos pretty well. Smells nice.</li>
    <li> This works great and was delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Went on vacation and purchased this for my sister who get&#x27;s extrem motion sickness !!!!! She rode in the car for almost 10 hours with. No problems and even rode on an air boat with no problems !!!! THIS REALLY WORKS !!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am dumbfounded.  I don&#x27;t know how it works but it really does!!  I was tremendously skeptical, but I have used this on two choppy cruises now and when others were still having issues, mine had cleared up.</li>
    <li> My daughter used this on the ferry ride with grandma from Washington to Alaska.  It gets rough on the open waters, so when the motion started, Nana put this behind her ears.  She layed down and was fine for a few hours of the worst of it, but as the rolling subsided and she went to get some hot chocolate, well...the hot chocolate didn&#x27;t want to stay put and she was &amp;#34;sick&amp;#34; (so as not to gross anyone out) for the remainder of the evening.  Not sure if this helped for a little while, but others swear by it, and if there&#x27;s a chance it helped a little, I&#x27;ll continue using it on my daughter, along with other aids.</li>
    <li> Best thing ever...I have had motion sickness since I was a kid...have used all the stuff on the market including the patch and wrist bands and this is the ONLY thing that works.  It has an order, but it disappears within 15 minutes.  I will continue to purchase this forever!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This little bottle sure packs a punch (in a manner of speaking). Do you suffer from motion sickness??  Sea, Air, Car, etc...  Hate taking those little pills that make you drowsy?  Then give this a try.  All natural and nothing to swallow.  Just a few drops rubbed behind each ear and let the aroma do its thing.  I used to get sea sick just being tied to the dock.  Well no more.  I love going out on the ocean.  Now we cruise for weeks and I never get sick.  Works for plane travel too.  No limit to how often you use it.  No medication to get hooked on.  Just wonderful oils (spearmint, eucalyptus, to name a couple).</li>
    <li> I used this product and did not get sick. I like it better than anything else I have tried aside from pure ginger. I would recommend this product and if I run out I would buy it again the price is good too.</li>
    <li> We went on a cruise in 2011. It worked really well for me. Now, I don&#x27;t know if I would have gotten sea sick without it. Maybe it was all in my head, but the point is I did not get sea sick. I think it&#x27;s worth the price and I still have an almost full bottle.</li>
    <li> While driving with my grandson he became car sick so I gave him Motioneaze and he felt fine in minutes !</li>
    <li> I went on a cruise and forgot my dramamine. In the gift shop they had chewable pills that I tried first that didn&#x27;t work and this stuff. I bought the MotionEaze, desperate, and it worked GREAT! I wasn&#x27;t sick for the rest of the cruise and I&#x27;m very sensitive to motion sickness. I keep it in my purse and use it in the car when I start to feel sick and every time I fly. Some people complain about the smell, but I think it smells earthy and natural and reminds me of a spa.</li>
    <li> I used this product recently for the first time, during an offshore fishing trip. Admittedly I used it in conjunction with Bonine, but the effects were almost immediate, I had started to feel queasy in moderate to calm seas about 3 hours into the trolling expedition. I was able to eat, drink and fish as normal.I had no issues with the odour, which is a bit loud but not all that bad. It&#x27;s very easy to apply and does what it promises.</li>
    <li> For my daughter&#x27;s science experiment this year, she wanted to do it on motion sickness.  We build an optokinetic drum, and placed six test subjects in it for five minutes.  This product was the clear winner!  I did not expect this product to work what so ever, but I was highly impressed!</li>
    <li> Best option for motion sickness prevention, and I&#x27;ve tried everything! Another perk is that it&#x27;s applied directly to the skin, so no drowsy side effects that most pills have.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Used this last week for a cruise during a tropical storm and the whole family had no issues with sea-sickness.  Kids didn&#x27;t mind me applying it and much easier than taking medicine.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t help in stopping from Nausea and threw everything during air travel from Delhi to Bangalore, India &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not so effective for Air travel</li>
    <li> This product prevented motion sickness while on a cruise. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I handled the curvy roads to Lake Tahoe and now I&#x27;m passing a kidney stone, What a woman. Thanks Motioneaze.</li>
    <li> Seems impossible that a liquid behind the ears would stop motion sickness but it really works.  I learned about it from my brother who used it when on a sail boat in the Atlantic.  It worked for him and works well for me too.  Take offs and landings sometimes gave me motion sickness -- no more!  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me on a cruise I went on.  Nothing worked, so I was seasick the whole cruise.  I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I went on a cruise recently and I am subject to sea sickness. I put this on whenever I was feeling a bit sick. However, it was hard to tell if I was feeling better because the boat stopped rocking as much, or because of the Motioneaze. But who cares, I felt better. I would say that the bottle is pretty small, so if you use it a lot it will run out fast.</li>
    <li> I have tried many ways to help with my motion sickness but no one works like Motioneaze. Very good product. In five minutes you are ok.</li>
    <li> Products works as advertised.  It has good after taste and keep mouth well moisturized.  Bought a good supply for future use..</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this - but hey I think it actually works. I used this oil behind my ears in combo with motion sick pressure bands and the 2 combined kept me feeling pretty good on my flights.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to take along on a cruise.  It is an oil to be rubbed behind the ear.  It&#x27;s perfect to take along and tuck into a purse or pocket especially if you don&#x27;t want to take a pill.  I like homeopathic cures better.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews as I usually don&#x27;t have the time. However after my experience with this product I feel compelled to share my story. I was out on a small fishing boat with a few friends whom were all pretty avid deep sea fisherman. It was my first time being out to sea in about 10 years but I had taken dramamine and I&#x27;ve never had motion sickness before so I was confident I would be fine. The waves were between 6&#x27;-10&#x27;. When we finally set anchor at our destination I realized my fishing rod required some repair. After messing around with my rod for 15 minutes I had suddenly become VERY ill, on the brink of throwing up. I&#x27;m not sure what I looked like but everyone around me could tell that I wasn&#x27;t feeling well. The captain reached into his tackle box and pulled out some Motioneaze, dabbed some onto my finger and told me to rub it behind my ears and under my nose. I kid you not I was cured almost instantaneously. I&#x27;m not sure how or why it worked, but it did. I was fine the rest of the outing and we ended up catching over 100 fish. This stuff really saved my ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m purchasing the stuff right now so I can have it on me for our next trip.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised there&#x27;s so many negative reviews. I ordered this for motion sickness while playing video games, especially games like Far Cry 4. The head bob and fast movement makes me very, very sick. When I apply this before I play I literally NEVER have any problems. I have tried this and Quease Ease and definitely prefer this. 5 stars</li>
    <li> I went on a family cruise and felt a little seasick, Went to the shop on the cruise and bought Motion Eaze.&lt;br /&gt;As it states on the box it works in 5 minutes without fail. So every time I felt a little queezy I just rubbed this behind the ears and it worked fast.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have NEVER used ANYTHING that has been as effective as this! And I have used EVERYTHING on the market, some better than others.  But this product worked for me, car, plane AND boat.</li>
    <li> The product packaging and labels were very clear and directions were easy to follow.  That is the end of any positive statements.  This experience out (Beautiful day, calmest seas I have ever been on and feeling totally rested and well before leaving shore) turned into what I can only call a nightmare.  Some how this product made me feel worse than I ever have.  I realized it about half way through the trip that every time I put it on I would get sick in 10 to 15 minutes after application.  I stopped the applications and managed to hold my stomach even though I still felt terrible.  Honest to goodness, I would have been better off without it and feeling bad instead of horrible and non functional.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could find anything to help my vertigo, but this really works!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I used this in conjunction with Hyland&#x27;s motion sickness for both my 6 and 10 year olds on our last cruise.  It works like a charm and doesn&#x27;t make you sleepy.  We used Dramamine on our first cruise and got very ill.  No problems whatsoever this time and the boat was really moving on one of our days.</li>
    <li> Took some of this before as well as a couple of anti-nausea tablets before going out into the Pacific ocean for some deep sea fishing...I was still pretty nauseaus, but not sure if the waters were just really choppy or what. Would probably have had a better review if not for the rough waters.</li>
    <li> A product I have used for years to curtail and eliminate vertigo.  I use it before trips on airplanes, and whenever I have that feeling that a vertigo period may be on its way.  It has worked for me and others I have recommended it too such as my 87 year old brother who suffered a lengthy period and serious medical treatments.  Another product used in conjunction with this is one call meclizine 25 mg (formerly a prescription product that is now sold over the counter).</li>
    <li> I tried this product because I didn&#x27;t want to use a prescription or over-the-counter medication while taking a recent cruise.  The drugs had worked for me in the past but made me drowsy.  I wanted to try a natural solution.  Motioneaze worked like a charm!  Within seconds of application, my sickness went away and I was able to enjoy the cruise.  I highly recommend Motioneaze for fellow motion sickness sufferers.</li>
    <li> I used this as directed while on a boat in the Virgin Islands for a week, along with the motion bandz and ginger gum.  I usually suffer pretty persistent motion sickness on moving vehicles, but I&#x27;m happy to say besides one pretty rough day at sea I was nausea free thanks to the combination of these products!</li>
    <li> Bought this item because of the reviews I read.  I wanted it for our cruise coming up.  My husband has always used those patches that his doctor prescribed.  And they work fine, but when we get home and he takes it off, he gets violently ill.  I&#x27;m hoping this Motioneaze will work for him so he doesn&#x27;t need those patches anylonger.</li>
    <li> The product was easy to use but it did not do  what was expected.  My problem may be meor servier and surgery may be my last resort.</li>
    <li> I have used this on several occasions and honestly i don&#x27;t know if it works.  When i apply it though i feel slightly nauseated but it does not grt any worst than that.  So in that regard it may actually be working, at least my nausea does not get too bad.</li>
    <li> Worked great. This is my second time ordering for my cruise.</li>
    <li> Works for me, but it made my puppy even more car sick.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t seem to help relieve my dizziness when attacks occurred, even when used in conjunction with meclizine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did discover the compression anti-embolism stockings did help when light headed when getting up from sitting or laying down.</li>
    <li> Its a great product, works really good.</li>
    <li> I finally used this after getting near-pukish on my last flight. I&#x27;m talking nausea to the point of &amp;#34;I never want to fly again, please get me off this plane now and let me die.&amp;#34;  However, a dab of this behind each ear and I was restored to an acceptable level.  I&#x27;m not saying I felt like a spring afternoon, but I didn&#x27;t feel like walking death.  It wasn&#x27;t instantaneous, but after about 5 minutes it was in full swing.  Has an odd smell too. Not a bad one, but a eucalyptus-esque type (at least to me).  It&#x27;s long enough to last with you after you&#x27;ve landed and washed your face with soap, but it&#x27;s oddly pleasant.  Probably contributes to the air-sickness remedy I&#x27;m sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, this works and you&#x27;d be wise to buy it.  Trust me, I fly for a living and know nausea.</li>
    <li> As a Merchant Marine I spend more than half of the year at sea and truly have a need for a good sea sickness relief. This is definately not it. Tried this product off Cape Aguhlas South Africa during some wicked weather and spent most of my watch in the head puking my brains out. I cant afford for something like that to happen while on watch. In my years at sea the best medicine I have found is simple meclazine available for dirt cheap. Usually buy 100ct bottle for about $03.50 @ walmart.</li>
