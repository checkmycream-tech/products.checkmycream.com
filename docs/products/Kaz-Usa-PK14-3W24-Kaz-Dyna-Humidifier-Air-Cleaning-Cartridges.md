    <li> I have searched when shopping  and could not find the filters for my Vicks Humidifier. Thank you for having them. There are 3 new cartridges  in the box. They look just like the cartridges that came with my new humidifier. The only difference that I notice is that the white filter is not as thick as my original one.  The cartridge fits the humidifier and I am happy to have been able to find them.</li>

    <li> Not really much to say about this product.  It works as I thought that it would.  Fits the humidifier that I needed it to.  So, thumbs up all around.</li>
    <li> The box was crumpled and was supposed to contain 3 filters and only contained 2.</li>
