      <li>YES its that good,</li>
      <li>Any good reviews that you see here haven&#x27;t owned it for a year yet</li>
      <li>My hair stayed in good condition and I loved it.</li>
      <li>This (the death of the dryer) has happened 2 more times, so now, after 3 years+, I have decided I will buy something else!   </li>
      <li>Its pretty as well as the heat setting are perfect.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>He loves the hair dryer and was so glad that I found it.</li>
      <li>It rubbed off on the counter top, my hands, inside the drawer--everywhere it touched.</li>
      <li>I also use it most days a week.</li>
      <li>I bought this blower and let me tell you I WAS IN LOVE.</li>
      <li>I love this dryer, so glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite dryer.</li>
      <li>Anyway, the cord is longer than some which I love</li>
      <li>I purchased from Sally&#x27;s Supply because my hair professional used this hair dryer &amp; I loved how if dryed my hair!</li>
      <li>When I first got this hair dryer I loved it, but over time the nozzle has become easier and easier to knock off.  </li>
      <li>I have owned this hair dyer for about 5 years now, and it is still going strong.</li>
      <li>It just died &amp; knew by sound</li>
      <li>(smooth touch) red&lt;</li>
      <li>Keeps hair smooth, not frizzy.</li>
      <li>It worked great until airport security decided to unpack my bag and then re-pack it with my hairdryer uncushioned on the outside.</li>
      <li>setting of Hot, Warm &amp; cool</li>
      <li>love this blow dryer works great don&#x27;t even have to use my flat iron when i use this unless I&#x27;m join for a stick straight look!</li>
      <li>Otherwise it drys really quickly and well.</li>
      <li>I have super curly hair, and I couldn&#x27;t believe that I didn&#x27;t have to iron it afterwards.</li>
      <li>Considering the price and its longevity, I would say it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
      <li>This hair dryer is powerful but that&#x27;s probably one of the only things I liked about it.</li>
      <li>This is the second one for us only because the original got A LOT of good use.</li>
      <li>A warrantee is fine however if one is purchasing a new product at a higher price that promotes  a quality product that does what it advertises, then you should not have to rely on said document.  </li>
      <li>I got the hairdryer free with the purchase of the flat iron (which is also fabulous)</li>
      <li>and I am so glad to hear its not only me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great; on the high heat setting it gets my fairly long hair dry in 5-8 minutes; on the lower heat setting, my hair always comes away smooth (and I have hair that prefers to frizz all over the place).</li>
      <li>Buy a blower for that much money that will last you many years.</li>
      <li>I tried the Jilbere and was ready to purchase until I realized who the manufacturer was.  </li>
      <li>(thanks, security)</li>
      <li>and it is fast.</li>
      <li>The first is a couple of years old</li>
      <li>THE FIRST ONE LASTED NEARLY FIVE YEARS.</li>
      <li>Works quickly and adds shine with moderate heat.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Settings of High, Medium &amp; Low&lt;br /&gt;Heat</li>
      <li>Also I didn&#x27;t notice this until I used my mom&#x27;s brand new hair dryer, but the power has become a lot weaker over time as well.  </li>
      <li>so I tossed it in my gym bag and bought a new one for home.</li>
      <li>and you might get lucky and have it live for a long time!!</li>
      <li>My little cheap travel hair dryer lasted a lot longer than that.  </li>
      <li>After about a year, the outer coating got soft and sticky.  </li>
      <li>While I like what the product does for my hair......quick drying, multiple heat selections and powerful fan and lots of watts, the product simply does not maintain operation.  </li>
      <li>as Sally&#x27;s in SW SALES same looking one under different brand name, looked in 2011 figuring ready to replace!</li>
      <li>The first dryer lasted about two years and the second one lasted only a year.</li>
      <li>and this dries it in half the time of the previous dryer and makes it smooth and straight!</li>
      <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but I saw others that reported that the hair dryer died within a year; and I wanted to add my experience with this hair dryer, and that it has had a long, lustrous life, and it is still my hair tool of choice.</li>

<li> Purchased this about four years ago as a set that also included a 1 1/2\\&quot; flat iron.  </li>
<li> Hair down to the middle of my back in 10 minutes flat.</li>
<li> but really it&#x27;s not if it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
<li> You can find ones that are less expensive that are even better than this one.</li>
<li> While it does dry my thick below shoulder length hair fast in about 5 minutes, the unit is quit heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I dont even use product in my hair until after my hair is dry, so is not that something is coming off my hands and dissolving it.&lt;br</li>
<li> The red coating is coming off, and it&#x27;s a sticky mess.  </li>
<li> &quot; long&lt;br /&gt;Heavy at 1 lb. 4 oz., it feels heavier on the nozzle which makes it tiresome to hold.&lt;br /&gt;Switches are right where unit is held</li>
<li> If I barely tap it with my brush, it falls off which is SUPER annoying as I use that nozzle each time I dry and style my hair.  </li>
<li> This hair dryer was also very heavy, I couldn&#x27;t hold it for a long period of time to dry my hair.</li>
<li> only thing is the attachment falls off easy an that gets annoying but only complaint!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s pointless.</li>
<li> It looks old and dirty and hideous unless you protect the coating.</li>
<li> Hope it&#x27;s same quality, sorry u all had problems.</li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s yucky, but it still works, so I feel bad buying a new one.</li>
<li> My complaint is how it&#x27;s built.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have a complaint about how it dries.  </li>
<li> I have thick, wavy hair</li>
<li> Bad investment overall.</li>
<li> I stupidly bought two lesser versions of this hair dryer and they were not nearly as good</li>
<li> To make matters worse, this hair dryer is very expensive and it makes me mad all over again just writing this review because they should have lasted longer for the price I paid.</li>
<li> Although didn&#x27;t notice bad until one yr ago.  </li>
<li> So disappointed.  </li>
<li> ... Thinking I maybe got a bad one, I bought ANOTHER one of course!</li>

    <li> Great dryer. Keeps hair smooth, not frizzy.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent hair dryer and lasted almost 3 years. My hair stayed in good condition and I loved it. I stupidly bought two lesser versions of this hair dryer and they were not nearly as good</li>
    <li> Excellent dryer. Works quickly and adds shine with moderate heat.</li>
    <li> I have owned this hair dyer for about 5 years now, and it is still going strong. I transport it everywhere, all the time (on trips, to stay the night at my boyfriend&#x27;s, etc). I also use it most days a week. I will admit, the red coating is coming off, and it&#x27;s not the prettiest thing to look at or the nicest thing to touch anymore, but I figured that it was because it&#x27;s 5 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it has been a work horse nonetheless. It&#x27;s great; on the high heat setting it gets my fairly long hair dry in 5-8 minutes; on the lower heat setting, my hair always comes away smooth (and I have hair that prefers to frizz all over the place). Considering the price and its longevity, I would say it&#x27;s well worth the money. I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but I saw others that reported that the hair dryer died within a year; and I wanted to add my experience with this hair dryer, and that it has had a long, lustrous life, and it is still my hair tool of choice.</li>
    <li> Great dryer for the price! I have thick, wavy hair and this dries it in half the time of the previous dryer and makes it smooth and straight!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is awesome for straightening my unruly curly hair.  Finally!  A hair dryer with power.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> love this blow dryer works great don&#x27;t even have to use my flat iron when i use this unless I&#x27;m join for a stick straight look! only thing is the attachment falls off easy an that gets annoying but only complaint!</li>
    <li> I love this dryer, so glad I bought it.</li>

The paint coming off it just another thing I don&#x27;t want to deal with.</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY SECOND PURCHASE OF THE SAME PRODUCT. THE FIRST ONE LASTED NEARLY FIVE YEARS. I USE IT PERSONALLY ONCE PER DAY ONLY AND NOT FOR AN EXTENDED TIME... BEST HAIR DRYER I&#x27;VE EVER HAD!</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite dryer. This is the second one for us only because the original got A LOT of good use.</li>
    <li> I got this years ago as part of a promotion. I got the hairdryer free with the purchase of the flat iron (which is also fabulous) It worked great until airport security decided to unpack my bag and then re-pack it with my hairdryer uncushioned on the outside. (thanks, security) Anyway, the cord is longer than some which I love and it is fast. Hair down to the middle of my back in 10 minutes flat.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I bought.  The first is a couple of years old so I tossed it in my gym bag and bought a new one for home. Its pretty as well as the heat setting are perfect.</li>
    <li> After about a year, the outer coating got soft and sticky.  It rubbed off on the counter top, my hands, inside the drawer--everywhere it touched. The drier still worked, but I threw it away.  Who on earth designed this thing? Lesson learned. Never again for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hairdryer and really liked what it does to my hair!!  Leaves it salon perfect! The problem is, that after a year, it died!  After some researching I found out it&#x27;s a CONAIR product, so I called them and was informed that it has a 4 year warranty.  I sent it to CONAIR and they replaced it... This (the death of the dryer) has happened 2 more times, so now, after 3 years+, I have decided I will buy something else!   The product is great if it&#x27;s within your budget and you might get lucky and have it live for a long time!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned &amp; used daily this hair dryer since 2005,maybe &#x27;04. I purchased from Sally&#x27;s Supply because my hair professional used this hair dryer &amp; I loved how if dryed my hair! I don&#x27;t have thick curly hair but always use round brushes while drying, I have fuzzy hair, so more work &amp; styling during drying. Yes, air director falls off, &amp; it&#x27;s hair spray &amp; products used that creates smeary coating. Although didn&#x27;t notice bad until one yr ago.  It just died &amp; knew by sound it was close a month ago! Costs $69.99 in 2005! Great dryer, why I&#x27;m online looking, as Sally&#x27;s in SW SALES same looking one under different brand name, looked in 2011 figuring ready to replace! Hope it&#x27;s same quality, sorry u all had problems.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer works fairly well.  I don&#x27;t have a complaint about how it dries.  My complaint is how it&#x27;s built.  The red coating is coming off, and it&#x27;s a sticky mess.  And no, it&#x27;s not \\&quot;just dirty\\&quot;.  I dont even use product in my hair until after my hair is dry, so is not that something is coming off my hands and dissolving it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s yucky, but it still works, so I feel bad buying a new one.</li>
    <li> My husband had this hair dryer before and it broke and couldn&#x27;t find one at the Sally Store, so I came to Amazon to see if they had one. He loves the hair dryer and was so glad that I found it.</li>
    <li> Had it for about two weeks and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I pushed the reset button for awhile and it worked again. Has anyone else had this problem?  I hope this won&#x27;t keep happening, especially if I am in a rush in the morning. Otherwise it drys really quickly and well. Update a year later.... still works but the red has rubbed off on my cabinet. Where the dryer sits every day there is a red stain. Otherwise it has worked well.</li>
    <li> When I first got this hair dryer I loved it, but over time the nozzle has become easier and easier to knock off.  If I barely tap it with my brush, it falls off which is SUPER annoying as I use that nozzle each time I dry and style my hair.  Also I didn&#x27;t notice this until I used my mom&#x27;s brand new hair dryer, but the power has become a lot weaker over time as well.  I&#x27;ve only had this hair dryer for 2 years max.  My little cheap travel hair dryer lasted a lot longer than that.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this hair dryer to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have had numerous Conair hair dryers quit on me over the last couple of decades!  (I gave up on the brand)  I have tried numerous models and the result is always the same.....they stop working after about a year.  (It should be noted I use a hairdryer twice a week only)  While I like what the product does for my hair......quick drying, multiple heat selections and powerful fan and lots of watts, the product simply does not maintain operation.  I tried the Jilbere and was ready to purchase until I realized who the manufacturer was.  So disappointed.  Conair  get  your  act  together.  A warrantee is fine however if one is purchasing a new product at a higher price that promotes  a quality product that does what it advertises, then you should not have to rely on said document.  This is one situation where you don&#x27;t get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Read some reviews here and I am so glad to hear its not only me. I bought this blower and let me tell you I WAS IN LOVE. It does it&#x27;s job. I have super curly hair, and I couldn&#x27;t believe that I didn&#x27;t have to iron it afterwards. That&#x27;s how good it is! BUT after a year, it died out. Ugh... Thinking I maybe got a bad one, I bought ANOTHER one of course! It&#x27;s good! BUT THEN...a year later, same thing. My blower went.Coincidence? I thought maybe it was possible. But after reading these reviews, I am not the only one. Its unfortunate because I really love this blow-dryer. I just wished it would last longer than a year. It&#x27;s pointless. I have to invest in a different blower now. If you want a blower that will last you for ONLY 1 YEAR, then by all means buy it. But if you want a blower that will last you longer than that, I advise you to buy another one. YES its that good, but really it&#x27;s not if it doesn&#x27;t last. Any good reviews that you see here haven&#x27;t owned it for a year yet --GUARANTEED. But they won&#x27;t be very happy when they get there. Another con is the coating. I had to wrap my blower with a cloth or towel to prevent the coating from coming off. It looks old and dirty and hideous unless you protect the coating. No joke, if you don&#x27;t, it will come off. But who want to sit there and wrap it every time? It was a pain. But hey, I figured I&#x27;d give you my 2 cents being an owner of this for 2 years and owning 2 of these blowers. Bad investment overall. $60  x2 blowers &#x3D; $120 on something that lasted me 1 year per blower which was a total of 2 years? I don&#x27;t think so. Buy a blower for that much money that will last you many years. Not this...</li>
    <li> I bought two of these hair dryers at the same store 1 or 2 years apart. This hair dryer is powerful but that&#x27;s probably one of the only things I liked about it. The first dryer lasted about two years and the second one lasted only a year. This hair dryer SUCKED! To make matters worse, this hair dryer is very expensive and it makes me mad all over again just writing this review because they should have lasted longer for the price I paid. This hair dryer was also very heavy, I couldn&#x27;t hold it for a long period of time to dry my hair. I would never, ever reccommend this hair dryer to anyone! You can find ones that are less expensive that are even better than this one.</li>
