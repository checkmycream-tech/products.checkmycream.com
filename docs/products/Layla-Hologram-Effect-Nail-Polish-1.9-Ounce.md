### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with this polish.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect holo polish for awhile.</li>
      <li>Awesome polish!</li>
      <li>I purchased this polish for the reviews I had read and the awesome color.  </li>
      <li>This has to be my favorite polish !!!!</li>
      <li>AWESOME!</li>
      <li>Do 2-3 coats for the best look.</li>
      <li>Love this product and this brand as well!!!</li>
      <li>Just amazing!!</li>
      <li>The color of the polish is absolutely gorgeous!</li>
      <li>And when its sunny its BEAUTIFUL.</li>
      <li>it would be a great polish for a day at the beach.</li>
      <li>It looks great.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not that great of a nail polish.</li>
      <li>this is a great holographic polish.</li>
      <li>and when the dryers done i take my hands up thinking im going to have theese amazing nails and NOTHING,!</li>
      <li>Looked amazing!</li>
      <li>Color Club has amazing holographic polishes that blow this one out of the water!</li>
      <li>Awesome but chips easily</li>
      <li>The linear hologram effect is gorgeous.</li>
      <li>One of the most beautiful nail polishes I&#x27;ve seen</li>
      <li>Also, don&#x27;t apply top coat to holos!</li>
      <li>The best way I have found to use this polish is to put on a couple coats of a basecoat (or topcoat) over the polish before jumping in the shower and then applying a fresh coat on top so that the linear holo stays as bright as it could be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is amazing when the sun hits it.</li>
      <li>anywho, amazing polish.</li>
      <li>I tend to bring my own polish to the salon with me.</li>
      <li>I really liked this color because I saw it on pictures.</li>
      <li>In addition to this, it comes off very easily in the shower.</li>
      <li>Also, this polish chips very easily.</li>
      <li>To tell you the truth, you have to depend on JUST the right light for the effect to be impressive to begin with.</li>
      <li>But i absolutely love the outcome of the nailpolish.</li>
      <li>I would definitely say this is NOT the best halo polish I&#x27;ve used and would not purchase anymore from this brand.</li>
      <li>After two coats, you can see the hologram effect, I was worried but the effect is more president when it dries.</li>
      <li>Just ok.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>This nail polish looks AMAZING in the light.  </li>
      <li>It was so magical.</li>
      <li>In love with this polish.</li>
      <li>I tried all the brands of top coat I had on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nail</li>
      <li>Was expecting a lot more for the price.</li>
      <li>if you cant find, cant afford, or dont want to use up your precious bottle of chanel holographic</li>
      <li>The application is somewhat tricky, but once you figure it out the effect is mesmerizing!!</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this polish!</li>
      <li>The color of this polish in bright light is nothing short of dazzling.</li>
      <li>Which is fine, but boy is that holo lovely.</li>
      <li>To me, it&#x27;s worth it for this amazing color.</li>
      <li>It would be nice if it lasted longer, but it&#x27;s still fun.</li>
      <li>Chips off really easily</li>
      <li>It also chips really easily.</li>
      <li>The bottle says something about buying a special top and bottom coat by the brand, but I&#x27;m not that invested in it, seeing as just this was $10.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also true that you cannot put a strengthening top coat on the polish as it will diminish the holographic effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And it dries incredibly quickly, too!</li>
      <li>I used cnd super shiney top coat.</li>
      <li>i super excited she puts on a top coat</li>
      <li>And, yes, my nails were well buffed to a smooth finish before applying the polish, which is what is recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>was so happy i went to do my nails the next day at the saloon</li>
      <li>application is smooth.</li>
      <li>Also, say goodbye to your topcoat, it pretty much erases the holo effect unless you&#x27;re in really bright</li>
      <li>Takes 5+ coats (it dries very fast, so this is more an issue of using a lot of polish, rather than taking a lot of time).</li>
      <li>I was excited to use it</li>
      <li>I used it the same day I got it and have received so many compliments because it is SO EYE CATCHING.</li>
      <li>and they love the colors and the look so much that they are considering stocking the nail polish in their salon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>the full five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>super finicky application-</li>
      <li>However, I have noticed if you apply more than 2 coats the vibrant hologram effect is dulled.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s super tricky to apply.</li>
      <li>In certain light, mostly outdoor light, it really did look pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall, very pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very pretty and has alot of depth.  </li>
      <li>It dries super fast and it is easy to layer.</li>
      <li>Which is exactly what it did!</li>
      <li>looks better with a topcoat, but as many holo fanatics might know, most topcoats will dull the cool effect.</li>
      <li>I might try again with a top and bottom coat of clear polish.</li>
      <li>Love it everything I expected &amp; more</li>
      <li>if you use this over a color maybe better but not on  natural nail</li>
      <li>I am so glad that at the same time I also ordered the Color Club polish as it was not only cheaper but far superior!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s awesome for about 2 days, then the effect dulls and your nails look grey.</li>
      <li>Love the effect of the polish, especially when I&#x27;m in the sunlight!  </li>
      <li>Really pretty</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty but it rubs off.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it says.  </li>
      <li>Pretty color</li>
      <li>One bottle will last and your holo polishes will be stunning.</li>
      <li>The only hologram is the top band of the label around the bottle.  </li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>More of a flat silver.</li>
      <li>Everyone who has seen it has liked it so far, so I will definitely be ordering this product again.</li>
      <li>i put it under a light to see it and the effect is barely noticeable ...</li>
      <li>A friend of mine wore it under stage lights and said it was almost distracting due to the wild colors it produced… but in a good way.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is that for all its beauty, the polish is not long-lived or strong.</li>
      <li>I thought things were looking fairly promising when I used Dazzle Dry top coat, but nope.</li>
      <li>If you manage to get a nice few layers down without it streaking and looking patchy it has a nice halo effect.</li>
      <li>It looks like plain silver polish in low light, but then out in the sun or even in strong lamp light</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this</li>
      <li>you really cant see holographic until you are in the sunlight.</li>
      <li>and I tried to like this polish, I really did.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does take a few coats for it to have the color more pronounced, but I have had no problem with streaking or chipping, so I think this polish was a success.  </li>
      <li>I originally found this possible three+ years ago in Ulta and it was on sale for $8, but I was still biting my nails at the time, so I saw no point in purchasing the product.</li>
      <li>Though the color and effect wasn&#x27;t as dulled as with the other top coats</li>
      <li>either read here or saw on a video that a top coat didn&#x27;t work well with the polish because it would dull the holographic effect, and that&#x27;s completely true.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really pretty BUT:  1. super finicky application- it took me about 4 or 5 coats and I still had streaking and splotches  2. It started chipping within 24 hours!  Definitely NOT worth $15!</li>
    <li> This has to be my favorite polish !!!! So recommend !!!</li>
    <li> Just ok. More of a flat silver. Put on many coats, or layer over a silver base to get more of desired effect.</li>
    <li> this is a great holographic polish. if you cant find, cant afford, or dont want to use up your precious bottle of chanel holographic, this is a damn decent alternative. application is smooth. looks better with a topcoat, but as many holo fanatics might know, most topcoats will dull the cool effect. anywho, amazing polish. will definitely buy another bottle to have as a spare.</li>
    <li> In love with this polish. I couldn&#x27;t stop staring at my nails after I painted them. It was so magical. The downfall, sadly there is one, is that you need intense light or sunlight to really make the holo pop. Otherwise, your nails tend to just appear silver. Which is fine, but boy is that holo lovely.</li>
    <li> Not worth $19.99.. no different then the much cheaper hologram polishes from other brands I have used.</li>
    <li> IT WAS NOT AT ALL WHAT I EXPECTED. IT WAS A VERY DULL COVER AND I LIKE BRILLANT SHINE AND SPARKLE.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this polish! When I first put it on I was really disappointed, it didn&#x27;t even look as holographic as some cheap stuff I&#x27;d bought in the drugstore. But when it dried I was floored! The linear hologram effect is gorgeous. And it dries incredibly quickly, too! A++</li>
    <li> This looks just like the photographs.  You do need to apply at least two coats to get the full effect.  However, if you want you can apply a light color like yellow, mint green, blue etc and one coat of the mercury twilight and get a super cool effect!</li>
    <li> this polish didnt really do much for me, its basically just silver with no nice shine or anything, maybe over accryllic its nice, but not plain nails</li>
    <li> so when i seen this colour online i went crazy looking for the color .and this happen to be the one i found that looks just like it ................ so my friend knew how bad i wanted it and purchased it for me as a Christmas gift when i got in i was so happy i went to do my nails the next day at the saloon ...&lt;br /&gt;so i have acrylic on my nails as shes appying the color i realize the color is SOOOO STREAKY with 2coats so i asked for her to put a 3rd she proceeds  , so the effect begins to emerge i super excited she puts on a top coat and i goto dry them and when the dryers done i take my hands up thinking im going to have theese amazing nails and NOTHING,! the effect is gone it just looks like grey polish i was so ferious i go outside and the effect basically vanished .... i put it under a light to see it and the effect is barely noticeable ... i figured it was my acrilic 2weeks latter i try again before i jumped into conclusions and tried it on my natural nails SAME THING EFFECT FOR THE FIRST 20MINTHAN BOOM .! IT BASICALLY DRIES UP AND VANISHES AND IT CHIPS LIKE CRAZY!! . IM so upset MY FRIEND PAID 20BUCKS FOR THIS deffinalty not worth it ,! i tried to ask the seller for at least a 20$ credit towords one of the different items they were selling do to the HORRIBLE product and false advirtisment and their answer was no as&lt;br /&gt;WILL NOT RECOMMEND TO BUY .! -</li>
    <li> Chips so easily, not worth 20$</li>
    <li> Awesome but chips easily</li>
    <li> This is one of the coolest nail polishes I&#x27;ve seen.  I used it the same day I got it and have received so many compliments because it is SO EYE CATCHING.</li>
    <li> Its a bit runny and takes several coats to make opaque. It can be streaky as well. If you manage to get a nice few layers down without it streaking and looking patchy it has a nice halo effect. I would definitely say this is NOT the best halo polish I&#x27;ve used and would not purchase anymore from this brand. Color Club has amazing holographic polishes that blow this one out of the water! Plus these are really expensive, I was not impressed.</li>
    <li> Love this product and this brand as well!!!</li>
    <li> Looked amazing! Took about 4-5 coats to fully coat it, and then it started chipping away almost instantly. I might try again with a top and bottom coat of clear polish. I dunno. The bottle says something about buying a special top and bottom coat by the brand, but I&#x27;m not that invested in it, seeing as just this was $10.</li>
    <li> It apparently needs a under coat to have the hologram affect...wish we would&#x27;ve known this when we bought it cause we would&#x27;ve ordered that also...</li>
    <li> Just amazing!! The application is somewhat tricky, but once you figure it out the effect is mesmerizing!! One of the most beautiful nail polishes I&#x27;ve seen</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty but it rubs off. Was expecting a lot more for the price. The formula is a little weird similar to childrens play nail polish.</li>
    <li> I originally found this possible three+ years ago in Ulta and it was on sale for $8, but I was still biting my nails at the time, so I saw no point in purchasing the product. Since then, I have stopped biting my nails and I regularly get my nails done, but I tend to bring my own polish to the salon with me. I bought this color and the Flash Black color and decided to go with Mercury Twilight in the end. The ladies from the salon (who know me by name from being in their so often) and they love the colors and the look so much that they are considering stocking the nail polish in their salon.&lt;br /&gt;It does take a few coats for it to have the color more pronounced, but I have had no problem with streaking or chipping, so I think this polish was a success.  Everyone who has seen it has liked it so far, so I will definitely be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this polish for the reviews I had read and the awesome color.  The polish did not last a day before chipping and peeling, the quality was worst than the cheap $1 nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the color might last on acrylic nails or gels nails but on natural nails it sucked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed in the quality, worst of all I could not return it back to Amazon because its considered a chemical type product.  I will never buy nail polishes on line.  At $17 each and I bought to colors that was a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I really liked this color because I saw it on pictures. It looks great. The only thing that you need to do is to give it a long time to dry, before applying the second coat.</li>
    <li> The color of this polish in bright light is nothing short of dazzling. The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is that for all its beauty, the polish is not long-lived or strong. It&#x27;s also true that you cannot put a strengthening top coat on the polish as it will diminish the holographic effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My preferred method in drawing out the longevity of the polish is that I: 1) start with a strong, chip proof base coat (Hard as Nails Xtreme wear silver Celeb works well http://www.amazon.com/Sally-Hansen-Nails-Xtreme-Celeb/dp/B004KRXDXK) Then, 2 coats of Holographic polish. The polish will still chip after a day or two at the tip of the nail, and what I do is touch up the edges as needed.  The polish will last about a week, week and a half with this sort of maintenance. To me, it&#x27;s worth it for this amazing color.</li>
    <li> You need about 3 coats to get the effect and it will look like a pearly gray . Now if you want to see the full effect in all of its beautiful splendour,  I highly recommend you use a chrome as a base. Some examples are essie no place like chrome or opi push and shove. It dries super fast and it is easy to layer. Try some different top coats in my opinion it didn&#x27;t dull the effect. I used cnd super shiney top coat.</li>
    <li> This is amazing when the sun hits it. Long lasting and strong. Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> After two coats, you can see the hologram effect, I was worried but the effect is more president when it dries. However, I have noticed if you apply more than 2 coats the vibrant hologram effect is dulled. I would suggest a silver or white base coat and a clear top coat for full effect. Overall, very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome for about 2 days, then the effect dulls and your nails look grey. It would be nice if it lasted longer, but it&#x27;s still fun.</li>
    <li> I expected something more than it is because it is so expensive.  I could have done the same at the drugstore for much less money.</li>
    <li> AWESOME! Do 2-3 coats for the best look.</li>
    <li> Love it everything I expected &amp; more</li>
    <li> Its kind of hard to apply if you don&#x27;t have the right base coat. so without it, you&#x27;d have to apply multiple layers. But i absolutely love the outcome of the nailpolish. On a cloudy day, it looks like regular gray nail polish. And when its sunny its BEAUTIFUL. Its as if you&#x27;re wearing two different nail polishes.</li>
    <li> The color of the polish is absolutely gorgeous! The linear holo effect is very subtle indoors, but becomes luminous outside. However, there are a few issues about it that stop me from going the full five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, it&#x27;s super tricky to apply. Takes 5+ coats (it dries very fast, so this is more an issue of using a lot of polish, rather than taking a lot of time). In addition to this, it comes off very easily in the shower. The best way I have found to use this polish is to put on a couple coats of a basecoat (or topcoat) over the polish before jumping in the shower and then applying a fresh coat on top so that the linear holo stays as bright as it could be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I&#x27;d recommend this to a friend, but I would warn them about the issues with application and peeling in the shower.</li>
    <li> This nail polish looks AMAZING in the light.  It looks like plain silver polish in low light, but then out in the sun or even in strong lamp light it&#x27;s a rainbow of colors.  A friend of mine wore it under stage lights and said it was almost distracting due to the wild colors it produced… but in a good way.  :)</li>
    <li> After reading the good reviews this polish received here, and after looking at a few YouTube videos, I bought two bottles of different colors of the Layla Hologram Effect polish. I was excited to use it and I tried to like this polish, I really did. But the truth is I just wasted my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all the coverage is terrible and streaky unless you put at least three coats, four is better. That&#x27;s a lot of product for such a high priced little bottle of polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And after using all that product, nothing I do helps to keeps it from chipping and peeling off almost immediately. I don&#x27;t mean chipping if you go and do a bunch of dishes or spend the day cleaning the house. I mean it starts to chip and peel away at the edges as soon as you gently wash your hands. And, yes, my nails were well buffed to a smooth finish before applying the polish, which is what is recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put four coats of polish on in the evening, doing nothing other than watching t.v. and going to bed afterward. In the morning after getting out of the shower I could see the polish was lifting and peeling away at the edges already. By the time I left work that afternoon the polish looked so shabby you&#x27;d have thought I&#x27;d been working hard with my hands, wearing that polish all week. I work a desk job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using a base coat to see if I could get the polish to stick better but found I couldn&#x27;t get the polish to cover the base coat at all. Even with trying to apply numerous coats, it was impossibly streaky looking and not adhering properly. I had to remove it all and start over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I either read here or saw on a video that a top coat didn&#x27;t work well with the polish because it would dull the holographic effect, and that&#x27;s completely true. But desperate to try and get the polish to become wearable I tried all the brands of top coat I had on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nail Tek II, Revlon Muticare Base &amp; Top Coat, And Sally Hansen Supershine, all dulled the holographic effect and muted the color so much that it was unatractive to look at. I thought things were looking fairly promising when I used Dazzle Dry top coat, but nope. Though the color and effect wasn&#x27;t as dulled as with the other top coats the polish still wouldn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, before the end of the day the polish was lifting off my nails all in one solid piece. I swear, I looked down at my hand and the color was completely gone on one finger, like it just fell off. Which is exactly what it did! It fell off, all in one piece, looking like a whole fake finger nail! So I peeled the rest off and didn&#x27;t need a single bit of nail polish remover to clean up my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give up. I won&#x27;t use this stuff again. Oh, and as far as the hologram effect that it offers? To tell you the truth, you have to depend on JUST the right light for the effect to be impressive to begin with. In certain light, mostly outdoor light, it really did look pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it stayed on it would be a great polish for a day at the beach. But if it won&#x27;t even hold up when you take a shower, I don&#x27;t think it would survive a minute in the sand and surf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad. :-(</li>
    <li> I didnt like these really only because if you are putting this on a natural nail you really cant see holographic until you are in the sunlight. if you use this over a color maybe better but not on  natural nail</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with this polish. The formula was horrible and very hard to apply evenly. Plus I personally found the handle on the brush too big which made it even more difficult to work with.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says.  Awesome polish!</li>
    <li> Love the effect of the polish, especially when I&#x27;m in the sunlight!  It&#x27;s very pretty and has alot of depth.  You should at least put on 3 coats, no less.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really thin coat, like a top coat, but the effects don&#x27;t kick in with only a coat or two. I wound up making probably 5-7 coats of this polish to get the effects it advertises. It also chips really easily.</li>
    <li> This polish goes on.easy, streak-free and in only one coat for me. The trick is to use an aqua base. Aqua base is wet-looking when dry and very slick. It will help with any holo polish or any polish that is difficult to.apply. I swear by Nfu Oh Aqua Base. A little goes a long way. One bottle will last and your holo polishes will be stunning. Also, don&#x27;t apply top coat to holos! It kills the effect in a big way.</li>
    <li> Pretty color BUT it&#x27;s very streaky &amp; you&#x27;ll need several coats to get a decent opaque color. Also, this polish chips very easily. I really wanted to like this but it&#x27;s not that great of a nail polish.</li>
    <li> Chips off really easily</li>
    <li> This  product was such a disappointment. I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect holo polish for awhile. I ignored the bad reviews, and thought this would be it. Boy was I wrong. I didn&#x27;t realize this is such a high maintenance product, so I did my manicure as always: light buffing, push back cuticles, and 2 coats of my HG Revlon Colorstay base coat. I&#x27;m busy, I don&#x27;t have time to spend an hour and a half doing my nails, and I can&#x27;t do them every other day. With my base coat, I can usually get 5-7 days before I get chips, regardless of the top coat I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied three coats of this polish, and it was STILL streaky; the layers also took FOREVER to dry, and were still so goopy that I ended up ruining a nail. Apparently you have to buff your nail a lot and use no base coat to avoid the streaks, but my nails are fairly thin and actually hurt if I overbuff. Additionally, this polish chipped on day 2, despite my basecoat! I can&#x27;t imagine it lasting long without one... Also, say goodbye to your topcoat, it pretty much erases the holo effect unless you&#x27;re in really bright lighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a great holo that you can use a base coat and top coat with, that will last a week with revlon CS base coat, that isn&#x27;t horrendously streaky, and is HALF the price of this, try Color Club Harp On It.</li>
    <li> The polish is watery and there are very little if any hologram effects.  The only hologram is the top band of the label around the bottle.  I am so glad that at the same time I also ordered the Color Club polish as it was not only cheaper but far superior!</li>
