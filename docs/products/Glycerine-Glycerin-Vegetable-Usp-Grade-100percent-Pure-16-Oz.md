    <li> All that I expected of it, it is also a multi purpose product. It is a great moisturizer for natural hair  I love my purchase.</li>
    <li> Use 100% natural glycerine , vegetable grade as one would use a body moisturizer.  Lasts a long time.  Apply immediately after showering, before going to sleep, or out and about,... to allow it to settle in so you won&#x27;t feel so greasy.  I believe it locks the moisture in.  Can&#x27;t replace moisture your skin has lost but you can use this product to retain it under your epidermis (skin).  Exercise by swimming at the beach during sunny days, 3-5 times a week, and am always outside gardening.  This has saved my skin and people comment on its youthfulness.</li>
    <li> Just what was needed! This is used in making tinctures in the MB2e machine. Also use it for balms, salves, vapor pen juice, etc. Use the code for discount on the Magical Butter machine! http://magicalbutter.refr.cc/G88G4CL&lt;br /&gt;Happy cooking!</li>
    <li> great product for the price</li>
    <li> this glycerin is very clean and easy to mix it arrived on time and I was able to prepare my vitamin C serum very easily</li>
    <li> I chose this for the amount and price, works well in my e-cigs and will last a long time. Buy it.</li>
    <li> You can use this with propylene glycol, soak some American Spirit tobacco in the mix, put it in a coffee cup, put that in a crockpot half full of water, set on low- in a few days, you have a good natural tobacco extract to use for e-cig DIY juice base.</li>
    <li> works great for my intended purpose</li>
    <li> My husband uses it almost everyday for his psoriasis skin condition.  It seems to be helping and he has not had to use any steroid creams since starting.</li>
    <li> I used this for DIY ejuice. This is my first time making ejuice, so I&#x27;m not sure what constitutes a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; VG, but I was able to make super cheap flavors. The only thing is that the flavors don&#x27;t hold well in this VG, but maybe that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t like using PG.</li>
    <li> good product and price</li>
    <li> NATURAL FOR RF home USE</li>
    <li> I received the vegetable glycerine on time and I&#x27;m using it as e liquid and it works like a charm :)</li>
    <li> Worked great for ecig infusions such as essential oils and nicotine free blends.</li>
    <li> Definitely natural. Tastes like sugar and didnt heat up when I tasted it. My skin creams turned out excellent when I used this product and made my skin and hair soft. I love this product. I just wish this company had bigger bottles cause I would definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> Love the product! Shipped quickly.!  Only problem was inner seal missing on coconut oil and it leaked all over. But still liked product!</li>
    <li> My daughter burnt her hands making t-shirts at her work.  Used this instead of the salve prescribed by her doctor.  Less pain, no scarring-Couldn&#x27;t have worked better.</li>
    <li> The glycerin did exactly what it was supposed to do. It worked fine in my recipe. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Works well for my hand made products...</li>
    <li> Perfect mix for my eliquids!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I am attempting to make my own moisturizer. This is high quality glycerine and I can not stress enough how amazing Dr. Adorable&#x27;s products are. I have ordered from them many times and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair to keep it soft and it works great.  It goes on like a thick liquid and penetrates my hair shafts very well.  I only need a little bit and the 16oz bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Nornally, I spray my hair with water often to keep is moisturized so I bought glycerine to see if it would make a difference.  I combine a small amount and water in a spray bottle, shake and spray my hair before heading out.  I don&#x27;t know about using it during the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Two thumbs up.  I like... :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff combined with my (totally useless but awesome smelling) body lotion to make it actually moisturize worth a damn, and I could feel a huge difference in my skin within a few weeks. I combine about 3/4 body lotion with 1/4 glycerin and shake really well.</li>
    <li> amazing for making e-juice! quick shipping from seller, and good quality. My liquids came out top notch! I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to make their own electronic cigarette liquid :)</li>
    <li> Great product, will buy again.</li>
