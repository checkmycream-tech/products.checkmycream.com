      <li>I love Nature&#x27;s Gate.</li>
      <li>and so glad I did.</li>
      <li>Our favorite conditioner, it is fantastic.</li>
      <li>After reading the ingredient label I decided to try the shampoo and conditioner because there is more earth friendly, non toxic stuff in here than anything else I&#x27;d looked at.</li>
      <li>Not too strong.  </li>
      <li>Seems fine.</li>
      <li>This stuff dries your hair out tremendously!</li>
      <li>I picked this up orignally because I wanted a cruelty free and vegan hair product.</li>
      <li>This product is great for dry hair or colored hair.</li>
      <li>This conditioner has a pleasant scent and seems to leave my hair in better condition than previous conditioners.</li>
      <li>We apply it after her bath, and have her soak in it for 10 minutes, and rinse with cool water.</li>
      <li>It smells good, it works very well on my dry frizzy hair, and it is a good price for a natural product.</li>
      <li>In nice proper package.</li>
      <li>I have been trying many natural shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>I previously used the Hemp Conditioner which was also really good.</li>
      <li>The product came very fast.</li>
      <li>Now I see that if glycerin is mixed with emollients like aloe Vera and h2o, then it&#x27;s much more hydrating to the hair&#x27;s shafts-cortex-medella</li>
      <li>This is my favorite conditioner to smooth out and tame my frizzy curly hair</li>
      <li>As a longtime user of this brand, I was excited to see it offered in bulk, with a free shipping incentive, and at a very reasonable price compared to what I&#x27;ve found it sold for in other venues.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper then buying it from whole foods, and I like not having to worry if i&#x27;ll run out!</li>
      <li>Thanks Nature&#x27;s gate ;)</li>
      <li>Also, the fact that it comes in a pack of 4 is very welcoming, as well.</li>
      <li>I really like how my hair feels after applying/rinsing this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Plus, it also is Earth-friendly, so I&#x27;d highly reccomend it ^_^!</li>
      <li>I have bought several of Nature&#x27;s Path sulfate free products.</li>
      <li>This conditioner didn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
      <li>I recommend this conditioner highly!</li>
      <li>Saving a whole lot of money makes me even happier.</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I had to discontinue using this lovely conditoner due to the glycerin</li>
      <li>I am not over exaggerating when I say, I felt my hair became soft with the first rinse.</li>
      <li>Its now near summer and getting hot here in the South.</li>
      <li>So far I like, onto later love, the formula for this product as far as for it helping my transitioning 4a/b hair retain added moisture.</li>
      <li>I have long fine hair that&#x27;s naturally curly</li>
      <li>Leave my hair soft and so much easier to untangle.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s all natural, but I have since tried other all natural products that do a much better job conditioning.</li>
      <li>It makes your hair soft and hydrates.</li>
      <li>Aloe is supposed to be a natural healer too.</li>
      <li>I have curly natural hair</li>
      <li>I am in the process of going completely gray and I noticed that my hair is a bit dryer than when it was colored.</li>
      <li>My hair feels so SOFT and manageable.</li>
      <li>I have curly, frizzy natural hair</li>
      <li>Definetely recommended to all the males out there confused as hell about these kind of things.</li>
      <li>Her red irritated skin will often have calmed down and gone back to regular color, and her coat is soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Even my mother complemented how soft it felt the next morning.</li>
      <li>It actually feels soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>The scent of the conditioner smells like skittles (the candy), the conditioner itself is thick in density, light on strands, and non greasy.</li>
      <li>This is great for someone like me who suffers from hair so dry, that even Salon quality poducts have no affect.</li>
      <li>Cruelty-free personal care products are not only superior to the cruel, animal-tested and animal-ingredient-formulated varieties, they are also much better for health and for our skin and hair.  </li>
      <li>We actually use this on our allergy dog and her extra sensitive skin.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner and shampoo for a while now and absolutely love what it&#x27;s done for my hair. I have long fine hair that&#x27;s naturally curly and this stuff smells so wonderful and conditions like nothing I&#x27;ve tried before. There&#x27;s no build up, no drying and absolutely no way I will use anything else again. After reading the ingredient label I decided to try the shampoo and conditioner because there is more earth friendly, non toxic stuff in here than anything else I&#x27;d looked at. Aloe is supposed to be a natural healer too. Wonderful product. Couldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> This is the only conditioner that my family uses.  We use the shampoo also.  It is great for any hair type and smells wonderful.  Not too strong.  Leaves your hair feeling nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great, hydrating conditioner!</li>
    <li> This stuff dries your hair out tremendously!</li>
    <li> Seems fine. Not damaging to hair. Not sure I would use it long term, as I don&#x27;t see any benefit or prefer the scent.</li>
    <li> This conditioner has a pleasant scent and seems to leave my hair in better condition than previous conditioners. It has a nice texture.         I would purchase it again!</li>
    <li> She has been bugging me to get this so that she can co-wash her hair, and she loves it! Definetely recommended to all the males out there confused as hell about these kind of things. Also, the fact that it comes in a pack of 4 is very welcoming, as well.</li>
    <li> If you use the Nature&#x27;s Gate Aloe Vera, you simply must get this conditioner! It&#x27;s so nice to smell, and works well into the hair. I just love how my hair feels when I&#x27;m done! Like the shampoo it&#x27;s paired with, it can be used daily and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair or cause it to frizz like regular shampoos. Plus, it also is Earth-friendly, so I&#x27;d highly reccomend it ^_^!</li>
    <li> I Love the shampoo.  I have been trying many natural shampoo and conditioner but I finally found it! thank you!</li>
    <li> Our favorite conditioner, it is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Smells really nice and it works well. I just have to use conditioner as my hair cannot due without it, hoping this will not hurt the environment.</li>
    <li> It smells good, it works very well on my dry frizzy hair, and it is a good price for a natural product.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner it smells great and is not too greasy...not much more to say...great product....I love this conditioner it smells great and is not too greasy...not much more to say...great product....</li>
    <li> This conditioner didn&#x27;t work very well for me. My hair was frizzy afterward and I had to use a lot of it just to feel like it was working. I ended up giving the bottles away. I do like that it&#x27;s all natural, but I have since tried other all natural products that do a much better job conditioning.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite conditioner to smooth out and tame my frizzy curly hair</li>
    <li> As a longtime user of this brand, I was excited to see it offered in bulk, with a free shipping incentive, and at a very reasonable price compared to what I&#x27;ve found it sold for in other venues.  Cruelty-free personal care products are not only superior to the cruel, animal-tested and animal-ingredient-formulated varieties, they are also much better for health and for our skin and hair.  I recommend this conditioner highly!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. It makes your hair soft and hydrates. The conditioner is the best. It detangles your hair and leaves your hair feeling easier to comb. This product is great for dry hair or colored hair. My hair is both!</li>
    <li> I adore this shampoo, I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now to help with the dryness/itchyness I get due to the low humidity in Colorado. This shampoo and matching conditioner have been perfect, and I have them set up for auto order! Every 6 months I get another box! It&#x27;s much cheaper then buying it from whole foods, and I like not having to worry if i&#x27;ll run out! Great product, smell good, works well!</li>
    <li> This item arrived on time but a couple of the bottles were slightly open causing a little bit of a mess on the bottles.</li>
    <li> I have used this for more than a year. I have curly natural hair I do not use it to detangle it does not have enough slip for me but I use it as a leave in. I will continue to buy this is bulk.</li>
    <li> I love Nature&#x27;s Gate. Period. I have curly, frizzy natural hair I&#x27;m about half way through transitioning and this is the only shampoo and conditioner line I use! I previously used the Hemp Conditioner which was also really good. Leave my hair soft and so much easier to untangle. I pair this with the tea tree shampoo and my hair is growing healthy and stronger than ever, even my co-workers compliment me on how healthy my hair looks.</li>
    <li> The product came very fast. In nice proper package. Did not have leak and was prefect. Will order next time.</li>
    <li> It left my hair feeling dry.</li>
    <li> So far I like, onto later love, the formula for this product as far as for it helping my transitioning 4a/b hair retain added moisture. Never in all my life has my hair felt truly conditioned. Please keep this product as is and bless the creator of this brand for making it actually do as it says it will do. The scent of the conditioner smells like skittles (the candy), the conditioner itself is thick in density, light on strands, and non greasy. Hopefully, I can use this all season long, I say this because as mentioned in the title...I&#x27;m skeptical about glycerin whilst others praise it. Now I see that if glycerin is mixed with emollients like aloe Vera and h2o, then it&#x27;s much more hydrating to the hair&#x27;s shafts-cortex-medella etc...Thanks Nature&#x27;s gate ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I had to discontinue using this lovely conditoner due to the glycerin&lt;br /&gt;drying my hair out. Its now near summer and getting hot here in the South. So&lt;br /&gt;the veggie glycerin, even though mixed with aloe and water + other solutions, is&lt;br /&gt;not acting right.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion...I don&#x27;t have time to figure out when to use this stuff accordingly to&lt;br /&gt;the humidity or dew points of the weather, therefore I just stuck with using oils and non-&lt;br /&gt;glycerin leave ins instead. Sorry Nature&#x27;s Gate. :,( cry</li>
    <li> It has actually HELPED with may hair loss.  No joke.  I use rogaine foam as well, but using this conditioner seems to give it an extra boost.</li>
    <li> We actually use this on our allergy dog and her extra sensitive skin. We apply it after her bath, and have her soak in it for 10 minutes, and rinse with cool water. Her red irritated skin will often have calmed down and gone back to regular color, and her coat is soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I really like how my hair feels after applying/rinsing this conditioner.  It actually feels soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Just what I need.</li>
    <li> I am not over exaggerating when I say, I felt my hair became soft with the first rinse. Even my mother complemented how soft it felt the next morning. This is great for someone like me who suffers from hair so dry, that even Salon quality poducts have no affect. I picked this up orignally because I wanted a cruelty free and vegan hair product. Plus it smells awesome&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the category of Vegan/Dry Hair/Cruelty free, or just something that smells great, then you should try this conditoner</li>
    <li> I have bought several of Nature&#x27;s Path sulfate free products. I did not like the Herbal Tea Tree conditioner. The smell was disturbing. This product is great. My hair feels so SOFT and manageable. I bought 4 of them and so glad I did. The price is great and the conditioner is just what I needed. I am in the process of going completely gray and I noticed that my hair is a bit dryer than when it was colored. I used to use Wen, but it didn&#x27;t do well when I stopped coloring my hair. So happy to read good reviews about Nature&#x27;s Path. Saving a whole lot of money makes me even happier. I&#x27;m sold on Nature&#x27;s Path.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and love that the ingredients are better than most conditioners out there.  I wish it didn&#x27;t leave my hair so heavy.  I won&#x27;t be getting it again because the weightiness is so hard to deal with.</li>
