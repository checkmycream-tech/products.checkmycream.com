      <li>I should have just bought the real Techniques Powder Brush instead (which I eventually ended up buying and is way better).</li>

      <li>The brush holds shape and dries relatively quickly.</li>
      <li>(I use an alcohol based cleaner), and dries quickly because you can leave it open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is the first ever folding brush, but if it is, why?!</li>
      <li>only area&#x27;s that foundation breaks up more easily, and under my eyes to set concealer.</li>
      <li>Worth it</li>
      <li>I tend to use this more for my Blush and slides on effortlessly whilst leaving your face with a soft glow.</li>

      <li>This is soft, easy to use, durable.</li>
      <li>I am actually going to order more just</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Soft and durable synthetic Taklon brush. This is an extremely well made brush that does not shed, looks pretty, and does not cost a lot. Amazon carries only a few from the collection. There are sets which do not duplicate the single brushes. I have the entire collection. This Kabuki brush is easy to hold, and easy to open. These brushes were available (and still are) at Ulta stores in the US. Amazing brushes!</li>
    <li> I love this brush, I actually began using it every morning a couple weeks ago. I use Make up forever Foundation and then Bare Minerals mineral veil to set the liquid and I use this brush to do it. The bristles are super super soft, the brush hasn&#x27;t shed on me even once and you can use the brush open ( picture shown ) or you can use it as a Kabuki brush style brush. I love this brush I am actually going to order more just so I don&#x27;t run out or abuse it.</li>
    <li> It looks cute but not durable. After a month it broke during it wash. I would recommend the ELF kabuki brush over this one anytime.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price.  This is an upgrade to the brushes I was using.  This is soft, easy to use, durable.</li>
    <li> I love this mini brush. it&#x27;s super soft, and small enough to carry it with me in my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> Got these for my wife and she absolutely loves them.  Very soft and the ability to split them and pair them she like as well.  It&#x27;s now one of her new favorite makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> I love that this kabuki opens up. I wish other brushes were like this. The fact that it opens makes cleaning a snap and the brush gets actually clean</li>
    <li> This hinged brush can be left closed for a traditional kabuki brush, or used open for a half-moon type brush, which works well for contouring the face (around the hairline, cheeks and jawbone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans well (I use an alcohol based cleaner), and dries quickly because you can leave it open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Versatile brush, great value, good quality and travels well.</li>
    <li> recommended 👍 top quality</li>
    <li> I love this brush, especially for setting my foundation. It&#x27;s super soft and cleans easily. The price is perfect and it does the job!</li>
    <li> this brush is so useful &amp; so soft i even like to just brush it on my face without any makeup!!!&lt;br /&gt;every girl in my family wants one!!</li>
    <li> I end up going for my normal, small kabuki more than this one. I do keep it for the bronzer, so I have a separate brush for bronzing and blending. Though the magnetic component is novel, I don&#x27;t end up ever opening it. Maybe that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t know what to do with it when it&#x27;s spread out.</li>
    <li> I already love the real technique brushes but this brush is so handy for travel! I use it folded together as a kabuki brush and then fan it out to use it for contouring! Amazing!!</li>
    <li> I should have just bought the real Techniques Powder Brush instead (which I eventually ended up buying and is way better). I thought it was gonna be really big and fluffy but don&#x27;t be fulled by the picture. It actually is pretty flat on the other side since it&#x27;s folding. It&#x27;s just a small kabuki brush cut in half and opened up on both sides. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s good use that can come out of it, I just haven&#x27;t found it yet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good brush if you use it for one purpose blush or contour because you may not want to mix the color or transfer bronzer on your blush</li>
    <li> Gift requested item because the receipent has first hand knowledge of this brand of cosmetic application brush.  She was very excited to receive it.</li>
    <li> Blend really good ..  Ah lil small for me tho</li>
    <li> It has a nice feel. When used opened it  makes the application of the blush more accurate and easy to blend. I travel a lot so the size is very nice too.</li>
    <li> This brush is great! With anyone who uses brushes to apply there make-up they know that it needs to have a certain feel when it touches your face. You don&#x27;t want a lot of shedding and you want your make-up to look flawless. This brush does that. I use it for my bronzer. I keep it closed to put it on my forehead and nose. Then I open it to get great detail on my cheekbones.</li>
    <li> While I love other real Technique brushes (they are soft and great quality for the price), I found that this once came smaller than expected and didn&#x27;t seem as solid as some of my other brushes.  While I thought I would like the split feature, its actually quite awkward.  I would rather have two regular brushes than try to use this single brush for multiple purposes.  I really don&#x27;t even like it to travel with.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this was a two in one pack, so I was surprised to find out they were actually hinged together! Very neat little surprise there. It&#x27;s a nice on the go brush for applying my foundation. Love how soft this brush is. Real Techniques has some amazing brushes, they are quickly becoming my new favorite makeup product brand.</li>
    <li> I tend to pack my personal makeup bag with enough product for about five people.  So I try to use travel-size or kabuki brushes to \\&quot;save space.\\&quot; I fell in love with the full-size rT brushes, so checking out the kabuki was a no brainer for me. This is a pretty small kabuki, but it picks up face powder just fine. I use it with my face powder or my finishing powder. I have opened it up into the 2 kabukis, but I just prefer to use it as one. As with all the other rT brushes I have, washing is no problem. The brush holds shape and dries relatively quickly.</li>
    <li> Bristles are so soft and I love this shape.  Also this brush is very compact and would be easy to travel with.  I only wish it came with a small cover for that purpose.  Real Techniques brushes are awesome!!!</li>
    <li> This brush is smallish when it comes to kabuki brushes, but is great for bronzing and blending.  The hinged operation makes it a more versatile: in open position I used it to do some minor contouring, and in closed position for blending and bronzing.</li>
    <li> I like this brush, it&#x27;s super soft, and it blends my makeup well.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t always keep its angled shape.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is just my brush that is doing this, but when I open the kabuki and then close it, the bristles fold inwards.  It&#x27;s nothing that&#x27;s not easily fixed, but kind of annoying...</li>
    <li> This is a small brush but it&#x27;s just perfect for what I needed.  It&#x27;s so soft and I haven&#x27;t had any shedding issues.  It holds the right amount of powder so that I get the coverage I want without it looking caked on.</li>
    <li> The brush is in &amp;#34;half&amp;#34; and snaps together ... which makes no sense in the use of the brush.  I have several other brushes from this line and love them ... this one will be stored with my other regret purchases :(</li>
    <li> This Kabuki brush is an angled brush and very very soft.  It&#x27;s good for all over powder application. I like the compact size and soft bristles.  It really grabs powder well and distributes it well. I prefer the large powder brush, but I bought this brush intending to use it for travel.  I was attracted to the dual use design, but I found that it didn&#x27;t work that well when open for contouring.  The brush doesn&#x27;t really stay open, so at least for me, it is only workable as a single use brush.</li>
    <li> I used as opened but I couldn&#x27;t use exactly because of shape of opened brush is not suitable for my face..</li>
    <li> good qualty and great value !&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s make the makeup clean and perfect and the good thing it&#x27;s double use</li>
    <li> The picture is deceiving. Smaller than I expected and then brissels were way to soft as well</li>
    <li> The split feature is fairly odd. It&#x27;s just not sturdy in your hand. It feels a lot smaller than kabukis. (it is smaller than the ones I owned.) Other brushes from this line are great  - just not this one.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup geek/addict! I am usually pretty satisfied with real Technique brushes. In the beginning when I first saw this brush it was on [...], I was ecstatic and immediately searched for it on Amazon. At the time I had been looking for a good contour brush since NARS Ita brush was out of stock EVERYWHERE! Watching the tutorial video I though okay this might work as a pretty good contour brush/ blush brush.  Once I received the brush and used it for the first time, I almost immediately regretted my purchase. The bristles of the brush are VERY flimsy and do not apply bronze exactly where you want it. I like to have a distinct contour line and this does not work for that effect. Maybe if the bristles were not so flimsy I would have loved it more. I use it occasionally as a blush brush but nothing more.</li>
    <li> Been looking for a smaller kabuki to apply face powder. I notice a lot of people complaining that this brush is too small, I find this to be the perfect size as it gets to the exact areas I need it to. I personally do not have oily skin, so I don&#x27;t like to powder everywhere. I powder only area&#x27;s that foundation breaks up more easily, and under my eyes to set concealer. The only reason I gave this a 4/5 and not 5/5 is because i think the handle can be a little longer, for whenever I have fake nails. The brush is super soft, and well made.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is the first ever folding brush, but if it is, why?! Its a great idea! I use it open for contouring, then closed to blend. Just the right size and the bristles are so soft. The magnetic closure was a nice touch to keep it closed.&lt;br /&gt;If i could change it in any way, I would&#x27;ve made a way for it to click/snap to stay open so you don&#x27;t have to hold it that way.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes for the price, def worth the buy.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy more and the are really soft. Worth it</li>
    <li> Love it. The best kabuki brush.</li>
    <li> Been loving all the Real Techniques brushes that I&#x27;ve tried and this one is great too!! Would definitely recommend this brush</li>
    <li> all brushes of real techniques are ideal. I am since I have this brush very happy. Price performance is ideal.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it  .. I thought I would get a big, soft brushes .. But I was  very surprised ..it is opposite a small size, and i am not comfortable  to use with make-up ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not repeat the experience to purchase  Kabuki brushs on Line.. again</li>
    <li> Very small, not a typical big kabuki brush</li>
    <li> This is an awesome brush....... glides your mineral makeup and/or powder on with ease. It also opens up to make the brush &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; for applying contour and highlites perfectly.  Buy 2 or 3 and you wont go wrong.</li>
    <li> I dont like it on my face :(</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing and great price! I have almost the whole set and they work really well with powder or cream.</li>
    <li> brush is excellent and soft. one of my favourite brushes i have right now.  i use it almost daily now</li>
    <li> Fluffy and super soft. 4 stars because I don&#x27;t see a reason to fold the brush. But overall a great brush. I use it to apply powder.</li>
    <li> I love real techniques brushes...they are so soft...and wonderful to work with!!!  I think I may have just about all of them that&#x27;s how good they are!!</li>
    <li> I have bought this brush  for my Makeup Bag so , I wish If it was had cover but Otherwise this&lt;br /&gt;i really like it , it&#x27;s so soft and small, but it does her work very well ........</li>
    <li> Very soft bristles, it does a great job with pressed powder. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever use it opened up, but closed, it&#x27;s a perfect little kabuki.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Real Technique brushes for a while now, and decided to take the plunge on this Kabuki brush. WOW - I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. This brush is amazing quality and is so soft! I tend to use this more for my Blush and slides on effortlessly whilst leaving your face with a soft glow. It&#x27;s very easy to clean and maintains it&#x27;s shape which has been a real problem for me with other brushes purchased in the past. This brush dries quickly too - I leave this to air dry and it&#x27;s good to use again within 2-3 hours. Excellent buy - I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate in recommending this brush to others and the complete Real Techniques range.</li>
    <li> And portable since is opens to be flat. Reasonable product for a reasonable price. Not my go to brush but one I can throw in my bag and not worry about.</li>
    <li> This double swing face brush is the softest ever.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of a kabuki brush separating into one large highlighter brush. Sounded great. However, I thought the bristles were a little too soft and uncontrollable to use for my foundation powders as a regular kabuki. I do like it split apart to use for some of my ambient lighting powders on my cheekbones, so at least I can still use it for something. My brush did have a big glob of hot glue stuck at the base when I received it and it does shed a little bit, so I figured a 3/5 rating would be fair for this product.</li>
    <li> its good but i dont like it when i open it</li>
    <li> Got these for my Son&#x27;s girlfriend and she never told me how they worked out but I assume they were okay as she didn&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> i really have enjoyed using this product because they are really soft and easy to work with they also leave an amazing finish.</li>
    <li> This is a nice brush - but not an absoultely must have. It is good for traveling. It would be great if it would come with a case for the brush though...</li>
