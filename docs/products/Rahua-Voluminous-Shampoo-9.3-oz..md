### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wonderful shampoo.</li>
      <li>Great stuff!</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>This shampoo works wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>Ideal pH for scalp is around 5.</li>
      <li>Best product ever of my hair; and it smells very nicely too.</li>
      <li>However, a friend mentioned that it was a great product</li>
      <li>Then I read a review of Rahua voluminous shampoo &amp; conditioner by a fellow dandruff head that said it cured his &amp; his hair was in great shape, so I gave it a try.</li>
      <li>I prefer intelligent nutrients...</li>
      <li>Another great thing about this shampoo is that it lathers well</li>
      <li>Great quality product.</li>
      <li>My Aveda is just as good</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s done good to my hair.</li>
      <li>my hair looks just as great with that and more bang for the buck.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t agree more!</li>
      <li>I will continue to buy this for sure!</li>
      <li>It also makes your hair feel silky and look amazing.</li>
      <li>I have very oily scalp and this shampoo may be the best I&#x27;ve ever used!!!</li>
      <li>I love the shampoo, it smells nice, leathers my hair just fine, and the outcome is very nice.</li>
      <li>Also I don&#x27;t think that this &amp;#34;voluminous&amp;#34; shampoo is good for fine hair.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a pretty good shampoo but not $32 good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s helped around 40-50% and maybe in time will work better.</li>
      <li>Everytime I use it, my hair grow stronger than before because I did so many times about dye, and floating color, you can tell how damaged my hair is, so when everytime I am using it, I can feel my hair has life again.</li>
      <li>Yes, I am totally, extremely love</li>
      <li>I told myself maybe it&#x27;s the shower steam making it look and smell off, so I continued to use about 3 more times.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff, but won&#x27;t buy another at $30 a bottle.</li>
      <li>It smells lovely.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I wished I could fall in love with this like everybody else</li>
      <li>, I love it.</li>
      <li>Okay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I got this as a sample and didn&#x27;t spend money on it.</li>
      <li>&amp; I&#x27;m scared to stop, though it is waaayy better since I added Rahua</li>
      <li>It leaves my feeling nice and clean.</li>
      <li>order a pretty fair amount of stuff on Amazon and never ever write reviews.  </li>
      <li>order a pretty fair amount of stuff on Amazon and never ever write reviews.  </li>
      <li>Learned about this product through Tata Harper, a great line of natural skin care products!</li>
      <li>This works great since it has no harsh detergents in it,</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t weight hair down, my hair is shinny and smells great!!!</li>
      <li>Works wonders on fine hair.</li>
      <li>That works fine</li>
      <li>would give 5 stars if it were more economical.</li>
      <li>I have used it three times &amp; my hair is 95% dandruff free now</li>
      <li>tax and free shipping from this</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair  well nourished and light.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many different shampoos, and none of them make my scalp feel as good as Rahua</li>
      <li>Now i&#x27;m pretty SURE</li>
      <li>My hair did not feel clean and I re- washed with my original brand.</li>
      <li>This does NOT give volume or clean up oil.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I will keep buying this product and try other products for sure!</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE Rahua, however,  I&#x27;m pretty POSITIVE that the RAHUA products from here are COUNTERFIT.  </li>
      <li>The smell is light, it cleanses really well without drying, and it leaves the hair voluminous and bouncy.</li>
      <li>(We all know the unmistakably distinct smell of coca-cola ).  </li>
      <li>More so, I&#x27;m upset that my hair has fell out in CLUMPS each time i&#x27;ve washed with this &amp;#34;sham-poo&amp;#34; so far.  </li>
      <li>Nice overall smell, &amp;  </li>
      <li>The REAL RAHUA has a very distinct, herbal smell, which after using for close to two years, I know that smell anywhere.  </li>
      <li>The supplier could have sealed the cap with tape just like what beauty.com did when I bought the product from them.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the shampoo is great and works for my fine, thin hair.</li>
      <li>i like this shampoo very much.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not harsh and leaves my scalp and hair clean and fresh without causing dryness.</li>
      <li>But with this experience, I felt compelled to go on here and write this review to warn others to ONLY BUY RAHUA FROM A REPUTABLE CHAIN.</li>
      <li>I purchased both shampoo + conditioner for the first time from this seller, to try and save some $$ and a commute to the city to get it.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t worry if it doesn&#x27;t larger like chemical based shampoos, it is still working better.</li>

      <li>I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Again, I have a conditioner that costs $9 that gives me much healthier hair.</li>
      <li>This shampoo leaves my hair very tangly and like it has a film.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really smell much herbs in it.  </li>
      <li>THE REAL RAHUA IS MADE FROM PRODUCTS FROM THE AMAZON.  </li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t need to use that much.</li>
      <li>I needed a shampoo that was gentle on my scalp so as not to aggravate it and cause flare ups.  </li>
      <li>The  \\&quot;I love Juicy\\&quot; shampoo from Lush does a much better job at cleaning up oil and giving volume to my long, fine but thick, untreated hair.</li>
      <li>I have long, fine straight hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine, curly hair that gets dry on the ends and a bit oily on the roots.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not fixated on shampoo, so I don&#x27;t really know what to write, but most shampoos make my hair and scalp get dry, and this is the first product in a long time that doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Rahua voluminous shampoo and conditioner for close to two years now, and I normally buy them on known sites and/or stores where Rahua is carried.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s normally $35 for a 9.3oz bottle (I bought it for $25.85 incl.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great quality product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Just Okay. I have fine, curly hair that gets dry on the ends and a bit oily on the roots. The reason I bought this shampoo is that I have terrible dandruff and wanted an all natural shampoo that didn&#x27;t irritate my scalp. Unfortunately, this shampoo did not work for me long term. My dermatologist told me that dandruff that is not caused by dry skin is more likely caused by an overgrowth of yeast. I think it has something to do with a pH imbalance. Ideal pH for scalp is around 5. For some reason, I could never get rid of my dandruff with traditional dandruff shampoos like Head and Shoulders, etc... Nizoral is the only one that worked for me. Even with that, I couldn&#x27;t use it every time I shampooed or my dandruff would come back. I shampoo about 2 times per week because otherwise my scalp gets irritated and my ends get dry. The first time I used this, it got rid of the dandruff but I noticed over time the dandruff returned. So, I realized it was irritating my scalp and possibly creating a pH imbalance. It wasn&#x27;t as all natural as I thought it would be. I now use a shampoo soap bar to wash my scalp and hair and rinse my ends with this shampoo. The shampoo bar leaves a sticky residue which I can only get out by washing the ends with shampoo. That works fine and I don&#x27;t get the dandruff as long as this shampoo doesn&#x27;t touch my scalp. Also I don&#x27;t think that this &amp;#34;voluminous&amp;#34; shampoo is good for fine hair. It makes it unruly and feel like it becomes fly-away hair. Finally, I did notice like another reviewer that this makes my hair fall out while I am shampooing it in the shower. I&#x27;m not sure why. This is the only Rahua product besides the conditioner that I&#x27;ve tried so I don&#x27;t know if they all have that same effect. I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo. The smell is herbal. Not a bad &amp;#34;motor oil&amp;#34; smell the other reviewers are saying. It smells lovely. Works wonders on fine hair. Don&#x27;t worry if it doesn&#x27;t larger like chemical based shampoos, it is still working better. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> i like this shampoo very much.  It cleaned my hair like a clarifying shampoo but it did not dry it out.  I needed a shampoo that was gentle on my scalp so as not to aggravate it and cause flare ups.  This works great since it has no harsh detergents in it,</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo, it smells nice, leathers my hair just fine, and the outcome is very nice. My next order though would probably be through the rahua.com website, because they suggested that Amazon is not an authorized dealer for their products and implied that the products sold on amazon might be expired or illegally obtained...</li>
    <li> I thought it would be a bigger bottle... Pretty expensive, but it&#x27;s done good to my hair.</li>
    <li> Disappointing shampoo.  My hair did not feel clean and I re- washed with my original brand.</li>
    <li> Using this shampoo over the last month and I can already see an improvement in my scalp. Much less dandruff and just generally shinier hair. You only need to use a little bit of it, so one small bottle goes a long way. Great product!</li>
    <li> unimpressed, the hair is a little &#x27;sticky&#x27;, would not buy again</li>
    <li> Best product ever of my hair; and it smells very nicely too. It leaves my hair  well nourished and light.</li>
    <li> Product is brown in color, not green like picture.  Can&#x27;t really smell much herbs in it.  My scalp broke out with bumps and scabs, which it does when i don&#x27;t use my selinium sulfide shampoo.  Will play around with it for awhile. Tried it because of article on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Oct. 17, 2015.  Will not buy Shampoo again.  Just a waste of $35.</li>
    <li> Yes, I am totally, extremely love this product!!!!First of all, it is giving my hair a obvious shine, and volume. Second, if I dont wash a night, my hair still have volume without dandruff. Third, everytime I am walking, my hair is dancing and feels lightness! Everytime I use it, my hair grow stronger than before because I did so many times about dye, and floating color, you can tell how damaged my hair is, so when everytime I am using it, I can feel my hair has life again. Honestly, I will keep buying this product and try other products for sure! The last thing is my hair loves the product~!</li>
    <li> This shampoo works wonderfully.  I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain so many nasty chemicals and no SLS!  Learned about this product through Tata Harper, a great line of natural skin care products!</li>
    <li> Made no difference in my daughters hair&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t mind paying the price for what the product said it would deliver  So I&#x27;m extremely disappointed</li>
    <li> I have curly dry hair, &amp;  had finally become happy with it after much trial &amp; error with products, till about a year ago when I developed dandruff. I had tried everything to cure the dandruff &amp; appease my hair, but I was getting no where with either. Then I read a review of Rahua voluminous shampoo &amp; conditioner by a fellow dandruff head that said it cured his &amp; his hair was in great shape, so I gave it a try. I have used it three times &amp; my hair is 95% dandruff free now, I love it. The night before (as often as every time or maybe weekly if it&#x27;s behaving) I saturate my scalp with apple cider vinegar &amp; my ends with coconut oil or one of those hair oils like aragan... then I wrap it in a t-shirt &amp; in the morning wash &amp; rinse 2x in the shower &amp; then apply the conditioner, comb it through &amp; leave the conditioner in without rinsing it out. I then apply my gel or mouse &amp; pardry with diffuser. Is it necessary to do the ACV treatment? Maybe not, but it was the only thing that had helped in the past &amp; I&#x27;m scared to stop, though it is waaayy better since I added Rahua</li>
    <li> I have very oily scalp and this shampoo may be the best I&#x27;ve ever used!!! Left my scalp less oily for a bit longer. Doesn&#x27;t weight hair down, my hair is shinny and smells great!!! Will definitely buy another one!</li>
    <li> Seems to work well. It leaves my feeling nice and clean. Nice overall smell, &amp;  I would definitely recommend this product. It is a bit on the pricey side and may choose to try other shampoo&#x27;s just based on that.</li>
    <li> either because the cap was loosened or the liquid leaked through the lid. The supplier could have sealed the cap with tape just like what beauty.com did when I bought the product from them.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the shampoo is great and works for my fine, thin hair. It&#x27;s not harsh and leaves my scalp and hair clean and fresh without causing dryness.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a pretty good shampoo but not $32 good. As far as natural shampoos go..I prefer intelligent nutrients...my hair looks just as great with that and more bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is expensive but it delivers volume, shine, and sleekness.  The effects persist even if one doesn&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Terrible, made my hair dry and brittle, same goes for the conditioner.  I don&#x27;t know if I didn&#x27;t something wrong (how can you shampoo and condition your hair wrong) or maybe I have odd hair, but this definitely didn&#x27;t work for me.  I have long naturally blonde (but I dye it brown) hair that&#x27;s thick but fine texture.  Hope this helps someone who has the same hair as me.  Both shamp and cond suck  waste of money.</li>
    <li> Sad to say that this didn&#x27;t work for me. It made my hair feel like straw even after 3 weeks. Have never experienced that before.</li>
    <li> This shampoo made no difference whatsoever in my hair&#x27;s volume. It actually left my hair feeling brittle as well. Unfortunately, this shampoo was not worth the price at all.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. it is very cleansing without being harsh. Leaves my hair very soft and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. Gives added body and volume.</li>
    <li> So I took a chance on this VERY expensive shampoo, and I am so glad I did. I have had a very difficult scalp issue for the past ten years. I have tried so many different shampoos, and none of them make my scalp feel as good as Rahua (alternating with Jason&#x27;s Dandruff shampoo). Another great thing about this shampoo is that it lathers well and you don&#x27;t need to use that much. I have a ton of hair and I use about a quarter size amount spread evenly throughout my hair. The smell is light, it cleanses really well without drying, and it leaves the hair voluminous and bouncy. I will continue to buy this for sure!</li>
    <li> Rahua did wonders for my dry, itchy scalp. It also makes your hair feel silky and look amazing. I am hooked.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo after reading a recommendation/review in the newspaper.  I agree it is a nice shampoo and adds volume without drying my hair out but its a fairly expensive product and I have other cheaper alternatives so I&#x27;m not sure I would buy it a second time.</li>
    <li> This ONE star is not for the product, it&#x27;s for the SELLER. DO NOT BUY RAHUA SHAMPOO FROM THIS SELLER.  I absolutely LOVE Rahua, however,  I&#x27;m pretty POSITIVE that the RAHUA products from here are COUNTERFIT.  It&#x27;s making my hair fall out in clumps--which has never happened before.  I&#x27;ve been using Rahua voluminous shampoo and conditioner for close to two years now, and I normally buy them on known sites and/or stores where Rahua is carried.  I purchased both shampoo + conditioner for the first time from this seller, to try and save some $$ and a commute to the city to get it.  It&#x27;s normally $35 for a 9.3oz bottle (I bought it for $25.85 incl. tax and free shipping from this seller.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I received from this seller is NOT the real thing.  The REAL RAHUA has a very distinct, herbal smell, which after using for close to two years, I know that smell anywhere.  Also, it&#x27;s supposed to be greenish in color (like in the pics!).  The one i got from this seller is BROWN and smells unmistakably like COCA-COLA !!!!!!!!! (We all know the unmistakably distinct smell of coca-cola ).  I noticed as soon as i poured it in my hand in the shower that it was definitely not the same product i&#x27;ve been using for that past almost two years.  I told myself maybe it&#x27;s the shower steam making it look and smell off, so I continued to use about 3 more times.  Now i&#x27;m pretty SURE it&#x27;s not RAHUA. I&#x27;m disappointed that I paid over $25 for a 9.3oz bottle of coutnerfit shampoo.  More so, I&#x27;m upset that my hair has fell out in CLUMPS each time i&#x27;ve washed with this &amp;#34;sham-poo&amp;#34; so far.  This has never happened with Rahua before. I don&#x27;t know WHAT i&#x27;ve been washing my hair with, it&#x27;s NOT RAHUA.  RAHUA is an all natural product,the shampoo that i got from this seller IS NOT.  I cannot return product since return window closed Jan 31-so now I am stuck with a $25 shampoo that&#x27;s made of god knows what kind of harsh detergent AND disgusting, mystery, chemical laden coca cola. THE REAL RAHUA IS MADE FROM PRODUCTS FROM THE AMAZON.  THIS SELLER&#x27;S RAHUA IS MADE FROM GOD KNOW&#x27;S WHAT KIND OF HARSH CHEMICAL DETERGENTS + COLA (which is known for its toilet cleaning properties besides being a &amp;#34;drink&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I order a pretty fair amount of stuff on Amazon and never ever write reviews.  But with this experience, I felt compelled to go on here and write this review to warn others to ONLY BUY RAHUA FROM A REPUTABLE CHAIN. NOT THIS SELLER.L RAHUA IS MADE FROM PRODUCTS FROM THE AMAZON.

    <li> I was hesitant to buy this shampoo because of the price. However, a friend mentioned that it was a great product so I made the purchase. I couldn&#x27;t agree more! I&#x27;m not fixated on shampoo, so I don&#x27;t really know what to write, but most shampoos make my hair and scalp get dry, and this is the first product in a long time that doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give 5 stars if it were more economical. But I plan to purchase when I get low, nonetheless.</li>
    <li> This does NOT give volume or clean up oil. My strands were still oily when my hair air-dried. This made my hair stick down to my scalp, which became itchy as well. The  \\&quot;I love Juicy\\&quot; shampoo from Lush does a much better job at cleaning up oil and giving volume to my long, fine but thick, untreated hair. I also tried the conditioner from Rahua Voluminous and it made my hair slightly silky, although still dry and tangled even after I applied my leave-in cream treatment. Again, I have a conditioner that costs $9 that gives me much healthier hair. I&#x27;m glad I got this as a sample and didn&#x27;t spend money on it. I wished I could fall in love with this like everybody else but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Ordered to treat my terrible scalp flakes (had for 10 years) and it definitely takes getting used to the lack of lathering foam. It&#x27;s helped around 40-50% and maybe in time will work better. I use it after soaking my scalp in ACV, my skin could just take longer since the problem&#x27;s existed for a decade.</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves my hair very tangly and like it has a film. I have long, fine straight hair. So I won&#x27;t be using this anymore</li>
    <li> Amazing shampoo, but it needs to be MUCH less expensive. I love this stuff, but won&#x27;t buy another at $30 a bottle. My Aveda is just as good and it&#x27;s pricey at $18...</li>
