### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>An excellent product.</li>
      <li>I am very impressed with the Captain&#x27;s quality again.</li>
      <li>Bay rum and sandlewood is probably the best combination there is.</li>
      <li>After using the product for a couple weeks now, I can say it truly is one of the best aftershave splashes I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful stuff!</li>
      <li>The scent is awesome and my wife just loves it on me.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, the sandalwood used here is a perfect complement to the spicy bay rum/cloves smell.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The performance of this aftershave is excellent as well</li>
      <li>Great scent and superb moisturizing properties.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a real nice complement to Proraso Sandalwood cream and pre/post.</li>
      <li>Face feels great after every shave.</li>
      <li>I wish the scent lasted longer, but it&#x27;s still a joy to use.  </li>
      <li>Smells very nice.</li>
      <li>but still if it were but a bit more pronounce it would be simply wonderful.</li>
      <li>love the sensation of splashing it on after a great shave and spending the day with its lingering fragrance, superior product!</li>
      <li>Good stuff</li>
      <li>I like the fact that I can apply it fairly liberally and not smell like I was molested by a perfume seller in the cosmetics department.    </li>
      <li>Having tried (and loved)</li>
      <li>This so called aftershave has no aroma, nor does it smell good on your skin.</li>
      <li>I imagine that if I held a block of sandalwood in my hand and scraped a shaving or two off with a good pocket knife, that this is what it would smell like.</li>
      <li>Good aftershave lotion with a pleasing scent.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This lives up to it&#x27;s rating and the company has created yet another superior product.  </li>
      <li>Lack of stinging indicates fewer burns and cuts meaning that I&#x27;ve given myself a good shave.</li>
      <li>She doesn&#x27;t love the compliments I get from it though lol.</li>
      <li>(though I&#x27;m sure this would be nice after any shave) and smells great.</li>
      <li>It leaves skin smoothe, refreshed, and smells amazing.</li>
      <li>Amazing scent, not too overbearing.</li>
      <li>Nice Sandalwood-like scent.</li>
      <li>This aftershave settles nice.</li>
      <li>Almost no burn with nice post shave feel after drying.  </li>
      <li>I find that on me it retains a nice power for an hour or two, beginning to fade after that</li>
      <li>This AS felt really nice going on.</li>
      <li>The Sandalwood aftershave goes on nicely, just as I would expect from any of the Captain&#x27;s Choice line.</li>
      <li>Nice bracing sting, followed by coolness.</li>
      <li>This aftershave has a nice balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent was nice but &amp;#34;subtle&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Perhaps the best part of this particular product is the scent.  </li>
      <li>Luckily, I can sprinkle Sandlewood sparingly and the rest Bay Rum for a great combo.</li>
      <li>does not smell of sandalwood very strongly.</li>
      <li>and I could not be more pleased with this aftershave!</li>
      <li>If you love the smell of pure unadulterated Sandlewood, this should be perfect for you.</li>
      <li>Very smooth and unbearing sandalwood scent.</li>
      <li>is a great scent that gets a lot of positive feedback from the ladies.</li>
      <li>more of a chemical smell.</li>
      <li>Authentic sandalwood smell</li>
      <li>I love Captain&#x27;s Choice aftershaves.</li>
      <li>The best recommendation I can give is this: I gave my wife a kiss goodbye in the morning, and she said &amp;#34;mmm, come back!  </li>
      <li>and this would fit in nice with some of my sandalwood soaps/</li>
      <li>So, the more astringency the better for me.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this aftershave.</li>
      <li>This aftershave &amp;#34;may not put more women in your life but it will put more life in your women&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Excellent Product lasting aroma</li>
      <li>even if another after shave might help them heal better without your feeling anything.</li>
      <li>Remember, most everyone forgets to shake the bottle/s quite well before opening to use.</li>
      <li>I would say that Pinaud Clubman is the most astringent and cooling, followed by Proraso, Clubman&#x27;s Bay Rum, and Clubman&#x27;s Sandalwood.</li>
      <li>I typically love Captain&#x27;s Choice aftershave products.</li>
      <li>Summary:&lt;br /&gt;The  splash is top notch.</li>
      <li>To me, that&#x27;s perfect - someone close enough to kiss or hug can smell it, but that&#x27;s all.  </li>
      <li>Paired with wonderful skin feel this is a definite winner.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably the most like a skin conditioner.</li>
      <li>Its aloe vera plus I suspect witch hazel are what make me say it is most like a skin conditioner.</li>
      <li>One of the best sandalwood aftershaves I&#x27;ve used in many a long year.</li>
      <li>Just a nice clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smells nice and is strong but the smell dissipates fairly quickly (I like that).  </li>
      <li>I swear too there are sandalwood chips inside, it smells very true to the wood and not a chemically reproduced version.</li>
      <li>Feels good after a straight razor shave</li>
      <li>Great as a very light hint and accent to shave creams and or moisturizers, etc., just too much for a pure cologne.</li>
      <li>although very mild.</li>
      <li>Most were too sweet or powdery for my tastes.</li>
      <li>the smell fades fast so it becomes more of a hint than an overwhelming force for others around you, unlike how many people like to do with their aftershave.</li>
      <li>Sandalwood is one of my favorite scents, and Captain&#x27;s Choice Sandalwood is the most pure scent you&#x27;ll ever find.  </li>
      <li>This is important (see below).</li>
      <li>Fairly light scent - remember, this is an aftershave, not a cologne.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic version of Sandalwood.</li>
      <li>The alcohol &amp;#34;hit&amp;#34; was medium strong but dissipated quickly.</li>
      <li>This is a nice new sandalwood aftershave but at times the level of scent can be truly lacking.</li>
      <li>Wow this after shave is amazing.</li>
      <li>preference is Pinaud Clubman because I like a cool feeling on my face after a shave.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what an &amp;#34;aftershave&amp;#34; is supposed to do: give a bit of alcohol bite (but not too much as to be drying), soothes the freshly shaven skin, and provides a nice olfactory finish to the shave experience.  </li>
      <li>others all have alcohol and give you that familiar cooling, fresh, astringent sensation.</li>
      <li>The alcohol smell just kills me, but it goes away fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>The burn is heavier than I expected, but not as strong as Co9T. Could also use a bit more glycerin for better moisturizing, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Longevity: The scent is mild, not a punch in the nose like others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s an aftershave that drys quickly and smells nothing like sandalwood.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ll start off first by saying that this stuff smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>My new favorite aftershave.</li>
      <li>I thought I would be adventurous and try something new form the Captain.</li>
      <li>Scent very pleasant but does not seem to last long.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good - without question - but for me personally it simply doesn&#x27;t carry much with it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey for an aftershave but worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I also pair this with Naked Bee Sandalwood Lotion as they are excellent compliments to each other in fragrance and quality.  </li>
      <li>I love the exotic scent of sandalwood, as with all of their other products, captains choice does not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is just right.</li>
      <li>Stings in just the right way.  </li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed is that it isn&#x27;t a cologne style like most after shaves, this one is subtle and very easy on the skin, I would recommend this to everyone who loves sandalwood!</li>
      <li>Unique aroma, not your normal sandalwood.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of sandalwood, and the Mad Scientist &amp;#34;The Captain&amp;#34; in his laboratory created a monster of an awesome scent.</li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re most concerned about keeping your face smooth and soft over the long run, you might prefer Lucky</li>
      <li>When I first opened this bottle I was overwhelmed with the authenticity of the sandalwood scent in this aftershave.</li>
      <li>but maybe next time I&#x27;ll put more on.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love the exotic scent of sandalwood, as with all of their other products, captains choice does not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;I love the sensation of splashing it on after a great shave and spending the day with its lingering fragrance, superior product!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this over the summer from the owner of the company Scott. This was my first experience with a sandalwood aftershave. I had some creams before, but they tend to be hit or miss as far as hitting the sandalwood scent is concerned. When I first opened this bottle I was overwhelmed with the authenticity of the sandalwood scent in this aftershave. The performance of this aftershave is excellent as well and it was very soothing for me. The scent of this aftershave is subtle, and will not interfere with whatever cologne you decide to wear, which is a plus for me. I think Scott developed a real winner and I could not be more pleased with this aftershave!</li>
    <li> I tried Captains Choice Sandalwood aftershave with this mornings shave. Here are my findings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Scent-? The scent was nice but &amp;#34;subtle&amp;#34;. I like the scent of sandalwood a lot and this would fit in nice with some of my sandalwood soaps/creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Scent-longevity? The scent dies down quickly. Hints of the scent are still there after 1 hour. For me I like a somewhat longer lingering scent but not like cologne which has become too much for my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Topical application? This AS felt really nice going on. The alcohol &amp;#34;hit&amp;#34; was medium strong but dissipated quickly. I noticed my skin tightened up. Was there a little witch hazel included? There was nothing that really stood out as a negative. Just a nice clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Moisturizing- I applied no balm after applying the AS. I noticed no drying, itching or irritation. My skin is soft but not oily or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Summary:&lt;br /&gt;The  splash is top notch.</li>
    <li> subtle and good. the smell fades fast so it becomes more of a hint than an overwhelming force for others around you, unlike how many people like to do with their aftershave.</li>
    <li> The sandalwood scent is pleasing. It smells very &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; to me. Four stars instead of five because I believe that the right blend of bay rum spices would have really hit this one out of the park, and because it doesn&#x27;t treat razor burn as well as Cat o&#x27; 9 Tails. The burn is heavier than I expected, but not as strong as Co9T. Could also use a bit more glycerin for better moisturizing, in my opinion. Overall, still very high quality and definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money. This so called aftershave has no aroma, nor does it smell good on your skin. A total waste of money</li>
    <li> does not smell of sandalwood very strongly. more of a chemical smell. i was warned by earlier reviews, guess i expected more</li>
    <li> Amazing scent, not too overbearing. Feels good after a straight razor shave (though I&#x27;m sure this would be nice after any shave) and smells great.</li>
    <li> Nice Sandalwood-like scent. Not overpowering, and in fact is not very long-lasting. But that&#x27;s a good thing for everyday wear, in my opinion. If someone gets close to you they will smell it, but you won&#x27;t overpower people twenty feet away when you walk into a room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep looking for something that smells like The Art of Shaving&#x27;s sandalwood that doesn&#x27;t cost quite so much. This Captain&#x27;s Choice is as close as I&#x27;ve come to it....</li>
    <li> Good aftershave lotion with a pleasing scent.  Not overpowering like some aftershave.</li>
    <li> Smells very nice. The scent is not too strong and doesn&#x27;t last too long. Wish it had a longer stay in power but maybe next time I&#x27;ll put more on.</li>
    <li> Stings in just the right way.  Smells nice and is strong but the smell dissipates fairly quickly (I like that).  It&#x27;s a real nice complement to Proraso Sandalwood cream and pre/post.</li>
    <li> Very smooth and unbearing sandalwood scent. Feels nice, a little sting but nothing like Pinaud for instance. I work 12 hour shifts and at the end am told there is a very subtle scent left if someone gets close, but from a foot or two away it&#x27;s unnoticeable in that time frame. In fact I&#x27;d give it about a 30 minute window where it can permeate the local atmosphere and after that it requires some proximity. I swear too there are sandalwood chips inside, it smells very true to the wood and not a chemically reproduced version.</li>
    <li> I use this as one of few aftershaves that I am willing to put on my face after shaving with a good double edge razor.  I also pair this with Naked Bee Sandalwood Lotion as they are excellent compliments to each other in fragrance and quality.  If you have not already read other hints and reviews - before you use this for the first time SHAKE it SHAKE it SHAKE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This aftershave is a great blend of ingredients for both moisturizing all by itself, as well as fragrance, it is not strong or per-fumy, it does fade (the scent) over time but last for hours.  If you are not sure about a sandalwood scent go to a local mall or outlet and try a few samples to get an idea - you should be pleasantly surprised.  Some blends are a little stronger than others, but the Captain has hit this square on the head as an aftershave, a true to the smell sandalwood scent, with other great aftershave ingredients.  This is NOT a cologne,  it will fade a bit over the hours but does stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lives up to it&#x27;s rating and the company has created yet another superior product.  I highly recommend and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> An excellent product. One of the best sandalwood aftershaves I&#x27;ve used in many a long year. This captures the essence of the wood: it isn&#x27;t overpowering but subtle and the scent does not fade away. I just received a sample of this in my box of Bay Rum and my order for a 4oz bottle is already on its way.</li>
    <li> Of all my Amazon purchases this has been the most disappointing.  My issue is that it has a very faint smell.  I don&#x27;t want an aftershave that is overpowering or real strong, but I expect at least a medium strength smell.  My wife has the nose of a bloodhound and when she says you can barely smell it&#x27;s for real.  I would not purchase this again nor would I recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> My new favorite aftershave. It leaves skin smoothe, refreshed, and smells amazing. Sandlewood by it&#x27;s self is a great scent that gets a lot of positive feedback from the ladies. Just for your knowledge, all captains choice aftershaves are bay rum based with whatever the scent is added. Bay rum and sandlewood is probably the best combination there is. If your younger and afraid of the old man vibe, don&#x27;t be. This is not and &amp;#34;old man scent&amp;#34; I&#x27;m 26 and my wife loves it. She doesn&#x27;t love the compliments I get from it though lol. It&#x27;s a bit pricey for an aftershave but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of sandalwood and I was looking for a replacement for the considerably more expensive sandalwood aftershave from Art of Shaving.  This aftershave actually smells better to me - it&#x27;s less sweet and more spicy than its Art of Shaving counterpart.  I wish the scent lasted longer, but it&#x27;s still a joy to use.  It has a nice, spicy, and above all masculine scent to it.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> Wow this after shave is amazing. The scent is awesome and my wife just loves it on me. A bit pricy but I&#x27;ll just be careful when applying.</li>
    <li> Hardly any sandalwood smell...not worth the price.</li>
    <li> This aftershave Is Amazing,the sandalwood scent is a light,but when you splash it on,it hits the breeze outside and all day you smell like Sandalwood.</li>
    <li> An expensive bottle of water. Get a refund.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is a bit too weak!</li>
    <li> Unique aroma, not your normal sandalwood.</li>
    <li> I picked up this aftershave based on multiple glowing YouTube reviews. After using the product for a couple weeks now, I can say it truly is one of the best aftershave splashes I&#x27;ve ever used.  The ingredient list for the Sandalwood version is simple: Alcohol, Essential Oils and Fragrance, Glycerin.  Unlike many other alcohol-based splashes I&#x27;ve used, Captain&#x27;s Choice doesn&#x27;t have an overly bracing effect.  You can definitely feel the alcohol when you put it on, but it quickly settles down.  I have oily skin, and don&#x27;t use heavy aftershave balms.  The alcohol and glycerin in this product leave my freshly-shaved skin feeling clean, soft, and not overly tight.  Perhaps the best part of this particular product is the scent.  All Captain&#x27;s Choice aftershaves have a bay rum essence to them.  At first, you get a strong bay rum smell, but it dries down fairly quickly to a soft, natural sandalwood.  In my opinion, the sandalwood used here is a perfect complement to the spicy bay rum/cloves smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for anyone, but especially those who have oily skin.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found a sandalwood product yet that last for any length of time and I have never had anyone say they noticed my after shave, good or bad.</li>
    <li> Sandalwood is one of my favorite scents, and Captain&#x27;s Choice Sandalwood is the most pure scent you&#x27;ll ever find.  Hours after putting it on in the morning, you&#x27;ll continue to enjoy its subtle aroma.  As with all CC aftershaves, it leaves your skin feeling refreshed and moisturized throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This is a nice new sandalwood aftershave but at times the level of scent can be truly lacking. Remember, most everyone forgets to shake the bottle/s quite well before opening to use. Even so, after taking care of that the scent may be a bit more present but not quite as forceful as expected. It&#x27;s a very subtle sandalwood scent which in and of itself is very nice but still if it were but a bit more pronounce it would be simply wonderful. Everyone has their own personal chemistry that can play many different roles with different scents of aftershaves, colognes &amp; perfumes. It&#x27;s good - without question - but for me personally it simply doesn&#x27;t carry much with it.</li>
    <li> Great subtle scent. Nice bracing sting, followed by coolness. Good stuff</li>
    <li> Very woody scent.  I actually prefer a hint of sweetness to sandalwood, but this is very masculine.  This seems alittle thinner and less moisturizing than Captain&#x27;s lime, and bay rum.  This does not have witch hazel like the others so the face feel is different compared them.  Overall I like it, and it pairs well with Taylor of Old Bond sandalwood shave cream</li>
    <li> Like this aftershave, not the scent I thought it was based on description. It does have a wooded type scent but not what I am looking for. I am going to try the Bay Rum scent and see how that is. I do like it but still looking. Not too much burn when applied after shaving, just the right amount for me.</li>
    <li> I love Captain&#x27;s Choice aftershaves. Granted they are expensive, but the quality of the product is well worth it. The Sandalwood aftershave in particular has a mile scent, while leaving a feeling of freshness all day long.</li>
    <li> I typically love Captain&#x27;s Choice aftershave products. Especially the Lime and Bay Rum&#x27;s. I thought I would be adventurous and try something new form the Captain. I should say, I have no doubt this product contains real Sandlewood, infact I found a tiny spec of what I believe was actual wood in mine which I love the real authenticity of it. However, I either forgot or never experienced the smell of pure Sandlewood, and for me its just too much. Great as a very light hint and accent to shave creams and or moisturizers, etc., just too much for a pure cologne. Luckily, I can sprinkle Sandlewood sparingly and the rest Bay Rum for a great combo. If you love the smell of pure unadulterated Sandlewood, this should be perfect for you. Just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different sandalwood aftershaves, but never really found one that I like. Most were too sweet or powdery for my tastes. Having tried (and loved) The Captain&#x27;s other aftershaves, I decided to give this one a go. Here&#x27;s my take:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: This smells like no other sandalwood scented product I&#x27;ve ever smelled! It&#x27;s similar, but quite different. I imagine that if I held a block of sandalwood in my hand and scraped a shaving or two off with a good pocket knife, that this is what it would smell like. It’s natural, woodsy, and very masculine. The scent is &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; to me, in that there is very little sweetness like you get with many other brands of sandalwood aftershave. It’s not powdery at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: The scent is mild, not a punch in the nose like others I&#x27;ve tried. I can certainly smell it, but with a healthy dose (enough to wet my cheeks, chin, mouth, and neck when I splash it on) it’s not overpowering at all. This is important (see below). I find that on me it retains a nice power for an hour or two, beginning to fade after that but still there. By the afternoon it’s not much more than a memory, but I like the scent so much that I often reapply when I get home from work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Topical Application: The Sandalwood aftershave goes on nicely, just as I would expect from any of the Captain&#x27;s Choice line. It does exactly what an &amp;#34;aftershave&amp;#34; is supposed to do: give a bit of alcohol bite (but not too much as to be drying), soothes the freshly shaven skin, and provides a nice olfactory finish to the shave experience.  This is where my point above really pays off. If the scent is too powerful, you can&#x27;t put enough of the product on without having an odor-aura around you. If the scent is too weak, then you never really get any enjoyment out of the product. This aftershave has a nice balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone who wants a quality aftershave and enjoys the scent of pure sandalwood.</li>
    <li> Just came in the mail. Had a nice little burn after straight razor shave. Subtle, clean scent that trails off a little after some time, but still lingers after an hour or 2. This is my new go to. I am very impressed with the Captain&#x27;s quality again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff! I really do love straight sandalwood scent not muddled down with a bunch of other smells and this hits the spot. Paired with wonderful skin feel this is a definite winner. Captain&#x27;s Choice has a gem on their hands!</li>
    <li> Fantastic version of Sandalwood. Face feels great after every shave. Great scent and superb moisturizing properties. All qualities of each and every Captain&#x27;s Choice products.</li>
    <li> Subtle but complex scent.  Almost no burn with nice post shave feel after drying.  Scent very pleasant but does not seem to last long.  I have enjoyed other Captain&#x27;s Choice products as well.</li>
    <li> Over the last year or so, I have bought and used five different after shave lotions - Lucky Tiger, Proraso, Pinaud Clubman, and Captain&#x27;s Choice (Bay Rum and Sandalwood). Depending on my mood, I used one or the other, so my comparison has been somewhat continuous. Overall, they are all excellent, however, they are naturally different in various ways, so one&#x27;s taste may cause a preference for one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucky Tiger is the least astringent. You don&#x27;t get that cooling sensation. It&#x27;s probably the most like a skin conditioner. Although its label says &amp;#34;with Aloe Vera&amp;#34;, its other ingredients are not listed. Its aloe vera plus I suspect witch hazel are what make me say it is most like a skin conditioner. I don&#x27;t think it has any alcohol. So if you&#x27;re most concerned about keeping your face smooth and soft over the long run, you might prefer Lucky Tiger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The others all have alcohol and give you that familiar cooling, fresh, astringent sensation. I would say that Pinaud Clubman is the most astringent and cooling, followed by Proraso, Clubman&#x27;s Bay Rum, and Clubman&#x27;s Sandalwood. It&#x27;s hard to say there is a difference between the two Clubman&#x27;s varieties. The coolness of Proraso is minty and lingers a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t believe in giving a product a poor review because it doesn&#x27;t meet a personal preference (for example scent or astringency in an after shave). Therefore, I would rate them all as five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My preference is Pinaud Clubman because I like a cool feeling on my face after a shave. Also, when an after shave causes any razor burns and minor cuts to sting, I feel like I am doing something positive to treat them, even if another after shave might help them heal better without your feeling anything. Lack of stinging indicates fewer burns and cuts meaning that I&#x27;ve given myself a good shave. So, the more astringency the better for me. As a bonus, Pinaud Clubman is the lowest cost.</li>
    <li> Unlike some other sandalwood aftershaves this one is neither too strong or too light. This is just right. I wear as a everyday aftershave. This aftershave settles nice. You can&#x27;t smell it on you but those around you can and that means lots of compliments. This aftershave &amp;#34;may not put more women in your life but it will put more life in your women&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Authentic sandalwood smell although very mild. You can splash a lot on and still have a subliminal effect on those close by.</li>
    <li> Fairly light scent - remember, this is an aftershave, not a cologne.  I like the fact that I can apply it fairly liberally and not smell like I was molested by a perfume seller in the cosmetics department.    The best recommendation I can give is this: I gave my wife a kiss goodbye in the morning, and she said &amp;#34;mmm, come back!  You smell delicious!&amp;#34;  To me, that&#x27;s perfect - someone close enough to kiss or hug can smell it, but that&#x27;s all.  Subtle, but present.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s an aftershave that drys quickly and smells nothing like sandalwood. I&#x27;m not sure what the smell is but is not sandalwood. Even if it did smell like sandalwood it would still be a poor aftershave.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ll start off first by saying that this stuff smells fantastic. I love the smell of this aftershave. This is one of the first alcohol based aftershaves that I&#x27;ve used. The alcohol smell just kills me, but it goes away fairly quickly. So you might wonder why I gave this such a low rating then. My face (the area that comes into contact with the aftershave) turns bright red like a rash and small welts start to appear. The rash and welts go away within an hour though. I&#x27;ve never been known to have sensitive skin, and I don&#x27;t have any known allergies but something in this gave my face an allergic reaction. I&#x27;ve tried this after shave 3 times with 3 different soaps and all with the same results. I&#x27;ve concluded that its this aftershave. I&#x27;m extremely disappointment because after the welts went away, I smelt like a million bucks.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product lasting aroma</li>
    <li> I loved being 1 of the few to test this after shave before it hit the market. I am a huge fan of sandalwood, and the Mad Scientist &amp;#34;The Captain&amp;#34; in his laboratory created a monster of an awesome scent. The first thing I noticed is that it isn&#x27;t a cologne style like most after shaves, this one is subtle and very easy on the skin, I would recommend this to everyone who loves sandalwood!</li>
    <li> I really like it - first time user - I will definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Not very strong or long-lasting. I like a subtle scent, but this is a little too subtle</li>
