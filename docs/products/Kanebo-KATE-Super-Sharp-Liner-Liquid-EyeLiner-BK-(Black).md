### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect customer service great product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great product.</li>
      <li>This has a very nice brush.</li>
      <li>i have fair amount of beauty products from amazon and will continue to do so</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Amazing seller.</li>
      <li>This liner does not, which is amazing.  </li>
      <li>It can be challenging to get it off at the end of the day, but nothing a good eye makeup remover can&#x27;t handle.  </li>
      <li>i liked how it looked.</li>
      <li>The pen tip is very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best liner I have ever used.</li>
      <li>bought this eyeliner in Shanghai and was so glad to see I can order more on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I was able to test all the colors on my hand and liked this dark gray color best.  </li>
      <li>Very precise and easy to put on</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and stays in all day.  </li>
      <li>but finish easy</li>
      <li>how it&#x27;s easy to hold</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and sooo easy.</li>
      <li>but the color is too light and it smudges and fades very quickly.</li>
      <li>this one kinda combined (super sharpe)gel brush + liquid eyeliner texture!</li>
      <li>so light.</li>
      <li>This liner goes on so smoothly.  </li>
      <li>i liked it, did not love it, i bought it because a beauty blog i read stated it was good</li>
      <li>Winged eye looks are pretty easy.</li>
      <li>Super vendeur, envoi rapide.</li>
      <li>Like the design of this eyeliner and believe it would be great if it had not arrived dried out.</li>
      <li>Best of all the end is thin</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;ll come right off without looking like its smeared.</li>
      <li>It turned out to be the smaller eyeliner and the color is very light.</li>
      <li>so you cant ever put on too much!</li>
      <li>Nice tip but color did not come out black, was more of a very washed out gray as if the product was old.</li>
      <li>Personally I use a pencil first for pigment &amp; basic structure, and then I fine tune it with this brush for filled in details or cat eye strokes</li>
      <li>much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;disappointed.</li>
      <li>pencil eyeliner is easy to get melt in summer and it makes you look like a panda bear; gel eyeliner (from MAC) is easy to use, but it takes time to care for brush and it gets dry too fast according to my useage; liquid eyeliner is usually the hardest one for beginner.</li>
      <li>so far, this one is my fav.!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pigment is on the lighter side with the first application/stroke, but that&#x27;s easily fixed with an extra coat or two.</li>
      <li>With most liners, I end up with flaking or else it inevitably leaves black smudges under my eyes by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>I do think it fades a little, but overall I am really pleased.  </li>
      <li>&amp;#34;BK-1&amp;#34; is true black.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone especially for those who want to accomplish winged effect.</li>
      <li>I love the fine tip which allows me to decide how thin or heavy I want to make the lines.  </li>
      <li>I already have 2 other brand of true black liquid liners and really like this lighter color.  </li>
      <li>Since this is the first time I am trying this product, I&#x27;m curious to see how long the liner will last me.  </li>

<li> It takes about 5 coats to get really dark.</li>
<li> It is less harsh and has a softer look for day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Its a little messy end of day.</li>
<li> You can do a very thin line, but making a thicker line isn&#x27;t too tough to do.  </li>
<li> bad experience.</li>

    <li> I used pencil type, gel type, and liquid type. so far, this one is my fav.! pencil eyeliner is easy to get melt in summer and it makes you look like a panda bear; gel eyeliner (from MAC) is easy to use, but it takes time to care for brush and it gets dry too fast according to my useage; liquid eyeliner is usually the hardest one for beginner. this one kinda combined (super sharpe)gel brush + liquid eyeliner texture! I love it!</li>
    <li> I like the felt tip and how it&#x27;s easy to hold but the color is too light and it smudges and fades very quickly.</li>
    <li> This liner goes on so smoothly.  With most liners, I end up with flaking or else it inevitably leaves black smudges under my eyes by the end of the day. This liner does not, which is amazing.  I do think it fades a little, but overall I am really pleased.  I love the fine tip which allows me to decide how thin or heavy I want to make the lines.

It does seem strange to me that the shipping estimate is so long (over a month, with no tracking), but it came sooner than the estimated time stated.</li>
    <li> Note that &amp;#34;BK&amp;#34; is actually a dark gray.  &amp;#34;BK-1&amp;#34; is true black.  See the Kate website:  http://www.kate-global.net/en/all_products/eye_liner.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this eyeliner in Shanghai and was so glad to see I can order more on Amazon. I was able to test all the colors on my hand and liked this dark gray color best.  I already have 2 other brand of true black liquid liners and really like this lighter color.  It is less harsh and has a softer look for day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product. It does not smear or wear off.  It can be challenging to get it off at the end of the day, but nothing a good eye makeup remover can&#x27;t handle.  The pen tip is very easy to use.  You can do a very thin line, but making a thicker line isn&#x27;t too tough to do.  Winged eye looks are pretty easy.</li>
    <li> i liked it, did not love it, i bought it because a beauty blog i read stated it was good i have fair amount of beauty products from amazon and will continue to do so thank you</li>
    <li> Very precise and easy to put on</li>
    <li> Super vendeur, envoi rapide.</li>
    <li> bad experience. takes really long to get this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is no color. so light. as only last drop of ink inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also it is really short. I got one from the retail store. much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;disappointed.</li>
    <li> i liked how it looked. but finish easy</li>
    <li> This has a very nice brush. It&#x27;s pigment is on the lighter side with the first application/stroke, but that&#x27;s easily fixed with an extra coat or two. Personally I use a pencil first for pigment &amp; basic structure, and then I fine tune it with this brush for filled in details or cat eye strokes so this product gets the job done for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive eyes and is a very lazy person, so if i&#x27;m out and I know I&#x27;m not going to sleep at my house I wear this and don&#x27;t have to carry make up remover because I can just wipe it with water and it&#x27;ll come right off without looking like its smeared.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and stays in all day.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone especially for those who want to accomplish winged effect.</li>
    <li> It turned out to be the smaller eyeliner and the color is very light. It takes about 5 coats to get really dark.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best liner I have ever used. Goes on smooth and sooo easy. Best of all the end is thin so you cant ever put on too much! Love...love!! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Black not dark and nothing shows that is kanebo</li>
    <li> Like the design of this eyeliner and believe it would be great if it had not arrived dried out. Nice tip but color did not come out black, was more of a very washed out gray as if the product was old. Only a small amount came out of the pen as well. Tried to add some water to the felt tip to see if that would help, but still did not work.</li>
    <li> Amazing seller. Perfect customer service great product. Thank you</li>
    <li> This product is just not working for me. Its a little messy end of day. Prefer kissme</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this product for years. She has tried several US companies but nothing came close to Kate Liquid Eyeliner.</li>
