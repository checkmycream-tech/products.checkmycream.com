      <li>I m so enjoy it.</li>
      <li>Great moisturizing shampoo for my very dry hair.</li>
      <li>(I have found that it is still carried by Ulta at this time) as well as their new products, so those of us who prefer the Vive Pro Hydra Gloss could more easily find it.</li>
      <li>Although this is not an exact replacement, we believe that it has some of the same remarkable qualities that you found in VivePro Hydra Gloss Shampoo.    </li>
      <li>this stuff has a powerful odor that lingers even if you rinse it super thoroughly.  </li>
      <li>Your hair really feels clean to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;Less</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t buy this shampoo if you are sensitive to strong scents....</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s good, I don&#x27;t see a big difference compared to other shampoos though.</li>
      <li>Using this every day works--my hair is clean and using this brand (and  the conditioner) is moisturizing enough that my naturally curly hair still curls, instead of turing almost straight and straw-like.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and wish that Loreal would let it return to the chain stores</li>
      <li>I have been using expensive shampoos for years and saw this product in a magazine with great ratings, so gave it a try.  </li>

    <li> I have used L&#x27;Oreal hair coloring formulas for several decades, but have never cared for their other hair care products until they developed L&#x27;Oreal Paris Vive Pro Hydra Gloss Shampoo and Cream Rinse. My hair never felt and looked healthier than it did while using these items. Then they began disappearing from store shelves as Loreal introduced their new line of \\&quot;Saloon\\&quot; hair care recipes. What a disaster!  My hair had never been so dry, brittle, and breakable as it was while I tried several of the different offerings. In desperation, I decided to try Amazon.com, figuring that if the Vive Pro Hydra Gloss line still could be found, it would be found there -- and there it was. My hair is finally getting healthy again, and I am grateful for L&#x27;Oreal not completely discontiniuing the Vive Pro Hydra Gloss group. I am using their Very Dry/Damaged shampoo and cream rinse again and noticing a BIG difference, as these are noticeably returning my hair to a soft, healthy-looking state once again. I highly recommend this product and wish that Loreal would let it return to the chain stores (I have found that it is still carried by Ulta at this time) as well as their new products, so those of us who prefer the Vive Pro Hydra Gloss could more easily find it. Why fix what isn&#x27;t broken?</li>
    <li> Disappointed with this purchase. I really wanted to like it based on the good reviews. I have fine thin hair and this shampoo made my hair seem dryer. Not to say that it didn&#x27;t work wonders for others. It could just be that I have stubborn hair.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels great in hair. This product left my hair wonders.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing shampoo for my very dry hair. I still need to apply conditioning, so perhaps it&#x27;s not the end all, but it is very good stuff.</li>
    <li> I wish these were still offered in the store because it leaves my hair in great shape and makes it a lot more manageable.</li>
    <li> it leave hair silkey and shiny  and smooth for long lasting curls......too bad it cant be found in the store like i did the first time i discovered it.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft, shinny.  No need for conditioner.  Your hair really feels clean to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;Less shampoo gives results you will like.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, I don&#x27;t see a big difference compared to other shampoos though.</li>
    <li> Probably one of my favorite shampoos out there, was pretty devastated to see Loreal discontinued it with a new similar line.</li>
    <li> I used the first order and my hair fell out a lot in the tub.  It also left my hair heavy and with no sheen.  I returned my second order.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed because I was excited to get the shampoo and i waited since 5 days because I am outside the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but Unfortunately, I got a conditioner!!</li>
    <li> They delivered promptly exactly what I ordered. I hate running out of shampoo and I hate going out shopping. So, having this delivered quickly to my front door was a bonus!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this shampoo if you are sensitive to strong scents....this stuff has a powerful odor that lingers even if you rinse it super thoroughly.  As for the &amp;#34;very dry/damaged&amp;#34; part of the shampoo....it doesn&#x27;t work any better than regular shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, including Suave or Costo/Kirkland brands.</li>
    <li> I loved what the both they Hydra Gloss shampoo and conditioner did for my hair, and have used them both for years. I contacted L&#x27;Oreal about this product, because I too could no longer find it locally. Here&#x27;s the response I received:  Hi Lucy,    Thank you for asking us about VivePro Hydra Gloss Shampoo. We are sorry to tell you that it was discontinued and that we do not have any available for you to purchase.    It was not easy for us to make the decision to discontinue VivePro Hydra Gloss Shampoo. This was a wonderful product that we know some of our consumers will miss. Unfortunately, demand was not high enough for us to continue manufacturing it. As consumers ourselves, we understand how disappointing it can be when a favorite product or shade is no longer offered.    Please try Advanced Haircare Power Moisture Hydrating Shampoo. Although this is not an exact replacement, we believe that it has some of the same remarkable qualities that you found in VivePro Hydra Gloss Shampoo.    You will find more information about this product, and all our current products, at [...]    We appreciate your loyalty to L&#x27;Oréal Paris.    Sincerely,  Inez  Senior Advocate, Consumer Care Center  Ref # 6887477    Now I need to begin the long process of finding another line or brand of product to use. RATS!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s winter and my hair is dry.  Skipping a day of shampooing (as is often recommended) just doesn&#x27;t work for me. Using this every day works--my hair is clean and using this brand (and  the conditioner) is moisturizing enough that my naturally curly hair still curls, instead of turing almost straight and straw-like.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, I color my hair and this shampoo Vive Pro Hydra Gloss makes it so soft and silky.  I am so very disappointed as L&#x27;Oreal has discontinued this product, so I am ordering it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I cannot find it locally&lt;br /&gt;It is the only shampoo and conditioner that tames my hair and makes it look healthy</li>
    <li> Great product for price.  I have been using expensive shampoos for years and saw this product in a magazine with great ratings, so gave it a try.  Love it, my hair is not so dry and bought the conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> My hair is curly and I have them straightened by Keratin. These hair products works well for me. It&#x27;s a pity can no longer find these products at local store. I am happy I can still order them online.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and great product</li>
    <li> Having tried several different products for dry hair I came accross this one.  It really helped and I added it to my&lt;br /&gt;wish list and will re order.</li>
    <li> My hear was damaged unbelievably with permanent usage of hair drier. I didn&#x27;t expect that anything could revitalize it but then I tried this shampoo with its conditioner and yes! it worked! I felt difference even after the first use of the product.</li>
    <li> Thought L&#x27;Oreal might not be making this. No one seemed to carry it. It is my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; shampoo &amp; rinse when I or the stylist have parched my delicate blonde hair. This seems to hydrate it in just one or two uses. Glad to find this here!</li>
    <li> The shampoo is great in this line (both dry and extra dry versions) but the conditioner is EVER BETTER! It&#x27;s the best conditioner I have ever used. Leaves my hair soft and silky smooth every time. And I have VERY damaged hair so that&#x27;s saying something :)</li>
    <li> I use this item for long time now. My har was damaged and super dry. Extramly fine hair. Very difficult to taking care of. This product. Oh my. Nomorly I believe the prise equal the quality. But it&#x27;s not. This product nice price and great quality. I m so enjoy it. Thank you for taking care my hair and price is amazing.</li>
