      <li>The day after I ordered my bottles, I received an email from Sophie, the Customer Care Manager for Tidy Space Products.</li>
      <li>is a review of the Tidy Space Travel Size Bottles.</li>
      <li>Nice product.</li>
      <li>The bottles seem very nice, filled but have not used yet.</li>
      <li>Will probably buy more of them for more &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;!</li>
      <li>My favorite purchase of this kind.  </li>

      <li>ARE STRONG AND FLEXIBLE!</li>
      <li>The design is great and the silicone material is so much more sturdy and easy to use than the cheap travel bottles you get at the store.  </li>
      <li>They are very easy to fill with any liquids and the silicon is safe for food,  </li>
      <li>This is amazingly effective at keeping liquids inside and making it easy to squeeze them out when you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>free sample was provided for review.t the bottles inside a bag of some kind.    </li>

      <li>We all love them.</li>
      <li>But they are unquestionably much better than those cheap-o plastic travel bottles you see in the wire</li>
      <li>But in any case, there is a way to test whether a surfactant can damage the bottle but that requires more work than I care to go through.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall these are outstanding.</li>
      <li>and that is saying a lot since I have tried them all, many, many times.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of different travel bottles, but these are the best I have tried.  </li>
      <li>paper insert has some warnings about incompatible products, things you shouldn&#x27;t put in the bottles; they refer to the website for more information.</li>
      <li>--I put them in ziplock bags just to be safe</li>
      <li>Fantastic product!  </li>
      <li>I got those bottles as a gift recently, and I have just one word to tell about this item : GREAT !!!!!</li>
      <li>Innovative</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The bottles themselves are great! Very handy, easy to dispense, have not leaked. All good so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give five stars except for the bag these are in: it is marketed as a reusable TSA compliant bag. I removed the bottles, filled them, and put them back in. This tiny amount of wear was sufficient to tear a hole in the corner an inch wide, making it useless as a transport bag in case a bottle leaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying the &amp;#34;loksak&amp;#34; set, which has a 6x9 inch bag. This fit perfectly in that bag with a bit of extra room to spare.</li>
    <li> Did not leak on flight. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Love these little bottles!!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed. They perform exactly as promised and most importantly, super cute ;)</li>
    <li> We have used one time and so far they are Awesome!</li>
    <li> Just got back from the Caribbean and loved my Tidy Space Bottles for Suntan Lotion and After Sun Cream - Took up very little room in my beach bag and traveled well in my carry on bag. Will probably buy more of them for more &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t leak yay love</li>
    <li> Great product and amazing customer service. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Top quality, easy to use and easy to clean product. It really makes a day and night difference when you use these bottles. Each one is easy to take apart and wash. Silicon body allows to squeeze out that very last drop, but be careful to follow seller&#x27;s instructions on what can and cannot go into it, or else do not complain later on. Glad I spent some extra time on Amazon to find this product!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the performance of the bottles.  Perfect for a quick trip where you don&#x27;t want to check your bags.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love these bottles, there is not other travel bottle I have found that lets you squeeze every bit of product out of them!</li>
    <li> So super practical and useful I gave them to everybody in the family at Christmas. We all love them. Strong, safe, and easy to pack and to clean.</li>
    <li> These are great! The way the caps are designed makes dispensing convenient and also gives me more peace of mind knowing that they will not leak. The bottles are very squeezable which I love (as opposed to some other plastic bottles where you have to be hitting the bottle for the shampoo to come out, or ruining the plastic by trying to squeeze it) Before purchasing these, I had a set of plastic travel size bottles that didn&#x27;t hold up after about 2 uses... but these look like they&#x27;ll last a while!</li>
    <li> The bottles seem very nice, filled but have not used yet. Spent more money than I thought for a quality product, however, the bag will not last (first day the slider came off) and it is a very tight fit with 4 bottles filled. Probably will have the bottles for a long time and will have to shop for another better, bigger bad to hold items.</li>
    <li> I am a frequent international traveler and these bottles are perfect for my needs. I prefer to use my own bath and shower products at hotels, as opposed to the lower quality products that are generally provided. These bottles are the perfect size and the quality is top notch. I&#x27;m looking forward to using them on an upcoming trip to Japan and will update my review upon my return, if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to a wonderful product, the seller has been amazing. The day after I ordered my bottles, I received an email from Sophie, the Customer Care Manager for Tidy Space Products. She thanked me for my purchase and included a user guide. It&#x27;s not rocket science trying to figure out how to use this product, but the guide includes some helpful tips, such as squeezing out any excess air in the bottles to account for pressure changes during air travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints about this product, however, I do wish I could purchase additional bottles individually. Fortunately, the company offers a $5 discount on future purchases if you register your bottles on their website, so I went ahead and ordered a second set.</li>
    <li> I received these as a free review sample. I have not tested the &#x27;TSA approved&#x27; aspect, but can attest that if you travel, even by car, these are perfect for those of us who travel light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are leak proof, and even the included bag keeps them dry as well as organized. My normal problem with toiletries is not that the bottles leak, but I tend to pack them when they are still wet. When I do they inevitably get other items in the same luggage wet or damp. These and the bag prevent that, so it&#x27;s one of the reasons why I rated them so highly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reason why I like these is because travel sized toiletries usually are as expensive as normal sized ones (and sometimes more expensive.) With this set I need not worry if my favorite brand of shampoo comes in a travel size - I pour some from my regular container into one of these bottles and save a bundle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: this set is a major convenience and for the frequent traveler a way to save on the cost of travel size toiletries while enjoying your favorite brands. And, of course, the peace of mind that your stuff will not leak inside your luggage.</li>
    <li> Bottles are great, however the enclosing bag is much smaller than that approved by TSA for carry-on toiletries. It takes a bit of fiddling to get the 4 bottles in, you have to alternate up-down as in the photo of this product. I tossed the bag as soon as I received the product and will continue to use a freezer zip-lock.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Looking forward to using it on my honeymoon.</li>
    <li> Love the squeeze bottles and the handy caps. Does everything one needs to get through security and have what you need on the trip.</li>
    <li> Love these bottles.... bought 2 and would buy more if I needed to.... EXCELLENT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Travelling across South East Asia; these containers rock.  I have not experienced any spills or leaking! Would ABSOLUTELY recommend.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of different travel bottles, but these are the best I have tried.  Not sure they&#x27;re perfect--I put them in ziplock bags just to be safe and it seems like they leaked a little, but in general they&#x27;re great.  The openings at the top are big enough to pour things in from shampoo bottles etc., and they&#x27;re soft enough that you can squeeze them and get everything out.  So not perfect, but I&#x27;m satisfied and will definitely continue to use them.</li>
    <li> Really love these bottles!! My favorite purchase of this kind.  The bottles have a flat bottom so you can stand them up on either end.  Very good feature that you cannot find with other bottles like this.</li>
    <li> they smell a little plastic-y initially. Just wash them out with some soapy water and they are good to go!</li>
    <li> Love Them! I will never buy another Travel bottle again these are Perfect!</li>
    <li> Just came back from vacation.  These worked great. At first I was worried about the wide base and fitting them into a quart sized bag for airline travel.  NO PROBLEM.  I fit then and a lot of other things.  The lids held and I&#x27;m using them for the gym as well.  I do like how they sit on their wide bottom, but truthfully it isn&#x27;t really necessary - usually they sit upside down so it is easier to squeeze them out.  They do seem to squeeze out with less force than a similar brand I&#x27;ve used, which is a good thing.</li>
    <li> Nice bottles but cheap bag that was torn when I get my order.</li>
    <li> These are perfect, they are soft and pliable so it is easy to get your products out! They are a unique shape that allows them to fit nicely together to utilize the space. Perfect size, and I love the soft ocean colors. I defiantly recommend this set!</li>
    <li> Love the travel bottles. Perfect for any travel or vacation!! I even bought a set for my daughter in law.</li>
    <li> UPDATE TO ORIGINAL POST! The afternoon I posted my original review I received an email from TidySpace to offer me a free replacement.  After inquiry into what product I used in defective product I was promised a replacement; which I received by the end of the week.  Excellent customer service and product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are great, but I have an important WARNING-- please read!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tidy Space Squeezable Travel Bottles are TSA Approved -- FDA Approved -- BPA FREE -- Food Grade Silicone.  With a LIFETIME warranty IF you register within 30 days of purchase.&lt;br /&gt;AS advertised the bottles are easy to fill, empty, and clean with the well-made screw-off snap lids.  They work fantastic in the shower while hands are wet and/or soapy.  The wide-mouth style makes it simple to turn upside down to get the last of your product; the BEST feature is they STAY- PUT on bath ledge.  Different colors make it easy to identify shampoo vs. conditioner, etc.  I&#x27;d say they are the greatest travel bottles I have ever purchased and that is saying a lot since I have tried them all, many, many times. I would have loved these when I was making baby food and carrying a diaper bag!&lt;br /&gt;I could only give four stars for a couple reasons.  I lost a significant amount of (expensive) hair product while traveling.  The packaging is minimal, as you see in description.  Inside of little bag is a two-sided description/instruction card which essentially tells you to wash before first use, keep away from the kiddos and register to get warranty.  States clearly that I can get the &#x27;Product How-To-Guide&#x27; on the website free when registering and lists fluids to never use in bottle.&lt;br /&gt;So, I took the time to register before using for first time prior to leaving on my trip, but I did not take the time to compare ingredients with my hair products.  Needless to say when I arrived at my destination the hair oil I use cause the bottle to change shape/warp, which cause the lid to come off and leaked product.  The company does state that they will replace my bottle even if I used a product they do not recommend; I will update upon completion of exchange.&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I dislike is that I could not get any sort of label to adhere so I used a Sharpie to identify family items.  By the end of the week most of my writing had rinse off of bottle making them appear brand new.  Could be a good thing I suppose.  Bottom line is I would buy these again and do recommend them to anyone looking for a solid travel option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the what the How-To states:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;WHAT YOU CAN PUT IN THEM  Even though silicone is one of the most utilized materials today, usage has shown that fluids containing alcohols, alcohol analogs, solvents, surfactants and silicone-based lubricants may not be compatible with the silicone. Since the incompatibility depends on the combination and varying amount of the ingredients, with the thousands of care products in existence, it would be impractical to test each one. The safest way to know whether or not your fluids are compatible is to do a test overnight. If there is no change to the bottle or to the fluid during this time, then it should be fine. We guarantee our product and will replace a bottle due to incompatibility. We won’t replace anything else in your suitcase. Always use a leak proof bag.&lt;br /&gt;As we become aware of specific incompatible products, we add them to our FAQs on our website. Please visit our FAQs for update.&amp;#34;e that they will replace my bottle even if I used a product they do not recommend; I will update upon completion of exchange.

The safest way to know whether or not your fluids are compatible is to do a test overnight. If there is no change to the bottle or to the fluid during this time, then it should be fine. We guarantee our product and will replace a bottle due to incompatibility. We won’t replace anything else in your suitcase. Always use a leak proof bag. As we become aware of specific incompatible products, we add them to our FAQs on our website. Please visit our FAQs for update.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Love the size and great for travel and everyday use.</li>
    <li> Purchased to use when going to the gym. So far they seem great I have had no problems with leaks</li>
    <li> These worked great.  Much improved over ever other small hard bottle I purchased.  Nothing leaked and getting the creams/lotions out was well controlled with the squirt tops.  They were better at dispensing my moisturizer than the original packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the space for marking the contents is NOT re-writable, I put a piece of scotch tape over it and wrote with permanent marker.  This way I can remove the tap to use them for different items each time.  I will probably end up buying another set to use even for items already made in a smaller size but in glass containers.  These are probably more leak-proof and won&#x27;t break.</li>
    <li> Perfect little travel bottles!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE,,,,THEY ARE STRONG AND FLEXIBLE!</li>
    <li> As advertised, compact, good cap, nice squeeze function. Flown with them twice to date, no leaking, they worked great!</li>
    <li> Great present for those  who love to travel or are always on the go</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:49d4ea93f1986cb5dd19bd5f84d1f9ba]]UPDATE: 4/21/2015 - The seller apparently read my review and today I received a replacement plastic toiletry bag to hold the bottles. So kudos to the seller for good customer service. Now I have two TSA compliant toiletry bags that is barely big enough to hold the bottles, both with a finicky slider that can too easily come off. But its the thought that counts. Good customer service is important.&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;This is a review of the Tidy Space Travel Size Bottles. I was provided with a free sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel a lot and do quite a bit of camping, These travel bottles are helpful for both activities. For travel I can easily fill them with shampoo, conditioner and when camping I can put in the same in addition to stuff like maple syrup, ketchup or other squeezable foodstuffs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are food grade silicone so you don&#x27;t have to worry about BPA. The caps click shut securely and these aren&#x27;t likely to leak even if they tip over with the cap undone since they have a sort of a self-sealing opening on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ve got to wonder about the warning not to fill them with products containing alcohols, alcohol analogs, solvents and surfactants. Since surfactants are used in most liquid soaps and shampoos, I&#x27;m not so sure that these make the best \\&quot;travel bottles\\&quot; since that&#x27;s what I usually put in a travel bottle. Soaps and shampoos. But in any case, there is a way to test whether a surfactant can damage the bottle but that requires more work than I care to go through. In practice, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the shampoos or body wash that I&#x27;ve put in these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The TSA compliant toiletry bag that these come in is close to worthless, The plastic closer piece came off the very first time I used the bag. I was able to get it back on but it wasn&#x27;t easy. The bag is made of a stiff kind of plastic and the bottles barely fit in the bag. It&#x27;s not convenient to use at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are quite nice, albeit expensive. But they are unquestionably much better than those cheap-o plastic travel bottles you see in the wire bin racks at Walmart.y are unquestionably much better than those cheap-o plastic travel bottles you see in the wire bin racks at Walmart.</li>
    <li> Bought before my first flight in a long time, really enjoyed them. The body wash leaked a little, but not much at all. There are easy to get product out and very easy to clean, which is what I never liked about hard plastic ones. My sister used them too, and is thinking about buying some.</li>
    <li> After using we bought another set for extended travel.  Far superior to hard plastic ones.  Love the pop top.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re very easy to squeeze; not stiff like some of the other travel bottles I have had. This makes it easier to get to the last drop in the bottle and it appears well constructed! I also appreciated the follow-up email before my order arrived, which included an attachment of how to care for the bottles and the ways they can be used safely.</li>
    <li> So far these bottles have worked really well.  The best part is the customer service.  I have a small issue and tidy space took care of it within 2 days.  Really impressed with the dedication to 100% satisfaction.</li>
    <li> These bottles are great! They are easy to use because they are soft which allows for all the product to be used instead of having to waste the last bit. They are the right size for airline travel and don&#x27;t leak if you follow the directions.</li>
    <li> They were actually MUCH cooler then I expected! I saw such good reviews, but I figured &amp;#34;They&#x27;re just bottles....&amp;#34; - I was initially drawn to the colors. But honestly they actually have a super appealing feel when you are using them, and refilling them. I never thought I&#x27;d be so happy about travel bottles, but I honestly am! Good job to the designers!</li>
    <li> Bottles work well during air travel with no leaking</li>
    <li> Products work as advertised... Innovative</li>
    <li> I got those bottles as a gift recently, and I have just one word to tell about this item : GREAT !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;nice packaging&lt;br /&gt;nice material and very soft&lt;br /&gt;I will probably get a other one so I could use one for my shampoos and soaps, the other one to bring food in the plane for my son (apple sauce, yogourt,....)</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!  I can see a number of uses for this.  Ideally, they&#x27;ll make larger versions to increase the number of potential uses.</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR TRAVELING. WE DID HAVE PROBLEMS WITH ONE OF OUR 2 OZ BOTTLES LEAKING SHAMPOO. ALL OTHER BOTTLES WORKED</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. I spent the extra money compared to other similar product because it advertised that they didn&#x27;t leak. They did and now I&#x27;ve wasted good face cleanser Ps. It was only my Clarion facial wash that leaked</li>
    <li> these travel bottles are absolutely excellent! the best i&#x27;ve ever had... very easy to use, lightweight, durable... no complaints.</li>
    <li> Work perfectly.  Very sturdy.  The only thing that leaked a little bit was the astringent, which I expected.</li>
    <li> IT FITS MY NEEDS PERFECTLY</li>
    <li> Bottles are well made. However, plastic bag arrived faulty (the plastic zipper came off immediately, since the end of of the zipper is unsealed.)</li>
    <li> These bottles are amazing.  I used them for a trip to Honduras, and they held up wonderfully.  No spills or leaks!  Money well spent!</li>
    <li> I really like these bottles.  They are soft when squeezed and pack really well.</li>
    <li> Best travel bottles I&#x27;ve found yet! Easy to fill, easy to use, and easy to clean. Love them!</li>
    <li> I am impressed by the strength of the bottle seals.  The bottle body is seamless all the way up, through the cap-collar, and the sealing, flip-top cap screws on tightly.  Inside the cap there is a fluid restriction diaphragm - so, in a sense, the caps are triple sealed!  Put the bottles in the clear, sealing pouch and you have a fourth seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I partially filled one of the bottles with water and squeezed very hard.  The bottle did not leak.  This appears to be a well-crafted product and I&#x27;m glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> When buying a travel product, the fundamental question I ask myself is “Does this item meet my travel needs?”  In the case of the travel bottles, the answer is “Yes.  Absolutely.”  What I am looking for is a bottle into which I can pour liquid (such as shampoo) so I will have enough for several days’ use without having to take the large bottle I have at home or having to go to the store to buy a couple of trial size bottles.  The travel bottles are easy to fill with enough capacity for a trip of a few days, and are made of food-grade silicone, so there’s no concern about contamination of the contents, especially if the bottle contains something used internally, such as mouthwash.  I haven’t seen any sign of leakage from the travel bottles.  In fact, one feature I like is the fact that when you turn one upside down to squeeze out some of the contents, it doesn’t start dripping right away because there’s a membrane inside the flip-top cap to prevent material from coming out until you squeeze the bottle.  One other feature I like is that you can write on the bottles.  I have labelled them with a fine-tip marker with no problem.</li>
    <li> No leaks and easy refills - great product</li>
    <li> Love these travel bottles! So convenient. So easy and great for traveling. Use them everyday!</li>
    <li> These are terrific, well made travel size bottles. The first travel bottle I&#x27;ve had that you can squeeze to get to the remainder.</li>
    <li> These are great.  They do just what you need them to do:  easily fill with your hair care materials and easily get just the right amount out.  I had no trouble taking these on international flights, but I will take them on road trips also since they are so convenient and high quality.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised with purchase. Beautifully package,easy to know what you are getting. Used for traveling to France. Caps stayed on,no leaking,no damage to carry on luggage. Little effort to fill containers and easy to clean out when no longer in use. I like how carrying all my essential are made easier with this product. I highly recommend this product to anyone who travels.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been needing this ever since the restrictions of liquids on plans came around.  I bought a couple similar products before but they were cheap and either leaking contained BPA.&lt;br /&gt;These bottles are perfect and let me take my particular shampoo with me, as well as a little bit of the drinks my picky son likes.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot for business and these travel bottles are perfect! They were easy to clean, incredibly easy to use and didn&#x27;t spill at all in my toiletry bag. I would definitely recommend to other people who travel a lot and need to fit their necessities into a carry on!</li>
    <li> I had misplaced my travel sized bottles and needed to purchase new ones for my trip and ended up with these.  The bottles are a great quality and I had no problems with leaking or spills from these.  I would highly recommend these for your toiletries!</li>
    <li> Great quality item with speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> excellent product - the bottles are easy to use and close tightly and perfect for travel.  The product arrived on time and the whole transaction&lt;br /&gt;went very well - I am very pleased with this product and it will make my trip a lot easier. I recommend this product. Great customer service&lt;br /&gt;from the vendor. VERY ATTRACTIVE PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Just received my bottles last week. The quality is excellent and I can&#x27;t wait to start using them for travelling.</li>
    <li> Really high quality bottles.  Expensive, but if you like the softness of silicone and perfect bottles, these are for you.</li>
    <li> These little bottles are perfect!  They are high quality, easy to fill and clean, don&#x27;t leak, and carry just the right amount.  I was looking for something to hold shampoo and conditioner for 7-10 days, and the typical travel size products are too small.  These larger bottles are perfect, and they meet the carry-on rules if you choose to do that.  I have never been happy with the drug store bottles and end up buying travel sized products - but no more!  So these will definitely save me money in the long run.</li>
    <li> I was provided a Tidy Space Travel Size Bottle Set free for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review, so this is what I found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What You Should Know Before You Buy:&lt;br /&gt;♦ This is a set of four bottles, two 2 oz bottles and two 3 oz bottles.&lt;br /&gt;♦ They are made from silicone material with a two piece lid on each one.&lt;br /&gt;♦ The design is excellent where the two piece lid wraps around the top of the silicone bottle to create a tight seal.&lt;br /&gt;♦ It did a great job of storing and dispensing various products (shampoo, body wash, hair gel).&lt;br /&gt;♦ Really nice quality and the silicone works so much better than the cheap travel bottles that you get at your local store.&lt;br /&gt;♦ Comes with a TSA approved zipper bag, looks like about the size of the quart bags that are allowed in carry-ons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was a really nice set of travel bottles.  The design is great and the silicone material is so much more sturdy and easy to use than the cheap travel bottles you get at the store.  We recently went on a trip and we picked up some of the Target brand small travel bottles.  The plastic was rigid and difficult to squeeze.  They only lasted the one trip with the bottles already showing cracks in the sides.  Cheap junk.  This set is much higher quality.  The silicone is so flexible that it is easy to get the product out of the bottle.  The design is very nice where the plastic cap has two pieces.  The bottom piece goes around the neck of the silicone part of the bottle and a small lip of silicone extends up past the bottom lid piece.  The top piece of the lid then screws on and the silicone is pinched in between to create a perfectly tight seal.  The lid also has a valve over the hole to further keep the product in when you aren&#x27;t squeezing the bottle.  The bottles worked great with all the different products I tried including some shampoo, body wash, and hair gel.  If you are in the market for some quality travel bottles and are tired of the cheap junk in the travel section of your local store, this set is worth a look.in the travel section of your local store, this set is worth a look.</li>
    <li> These are outstanding bottles for travel. They are exactly the right size for carryon luggage and are incredibly leak proof. Unless the cap flips open, or the top isn&#x27;t screwed on tightly; these bottles will never leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system is ingenious. The bottles are soft silicone so you can squeeze out product - shampoo, conditioner, lotion, mouthwash, or alcohol. There is a little one way valve in the spout - it is the same kind of valve you see on mustard or ketchup bottles. Then the flip top cap snaps super solid and completely seals the spout (in fact there is a round peg that pushes against that valve preventing it from opening). This is amazingly effective at keeping liquids inside and making it easy to squeeze them out when you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They even thought about the size of opening to fill these. The opening is huge allowing you to pour things into the bottle easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you tighten the cap and snap the cover closed, these bottles will never leak. A 230 pound man stood on the bottle, the cap never opened. That&#x27;s a lot of pressure - way more than you would see in an airplane. You can trust these will not open. I found that if you don&#x27;t screw the cap on at least hand tight, the bottle can pull loose out of the cap. Just make sure you tighten the cap. Of course if you don&#x27;t snap the cover closed, the bottle will leak - hey that&#x27;s by design, you have to get product out of these somehow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two different colors is a great idea. There is a large and a small bottle in each color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper insert has some warnings about incompatible products, things you shouldn&#x27;t put in the bottles; they refer to the website for more information. Follow the link to get the latest information on what is compatible and how to properly test the bottles. Tidy Space is cautious and responsible about what will and won&#x27;t work in their bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall these are outstanding. They are so much better than little plastic bottles. Just to be certain, even if you pack these in a suitcase, put the bottles inside a bag of some kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A free sample was provided for review.t the bottles inside a bag of some kind.

    <li> These travel bottles are great!  I love the colors and the silicone has a very nice &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; to it.  The airlines accept them, so instead of spending a lot of money on travel size shampoo and mouthwash, I can just fill these with my regular brands. They are very easy to fill with any liquids and the silicon is safe for food,  so I use one for honey to add to my tea!  And they don&#x27;t leak!  They even can go in the dishwasher so I can put different things in them on my next trip.  And the pouch is the right size for the airlines and I can easily see what I have in it.  I&#x27;d recommend them for any frequent or non-frequent flyer.</li>
    <li> These are excellent! The only travel bottles I have ever found that didn&#x27;t EVER leak, even during several flights. Super easy to use, wash, and fill. I plan to get more!</li>
    <li> This is our third try at finding a container that will not leak carrying half-and-half in a backpack for several hours.  Success at last!</li>
