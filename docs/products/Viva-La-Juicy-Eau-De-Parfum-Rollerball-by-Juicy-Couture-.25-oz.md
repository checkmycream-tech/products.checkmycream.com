      <li>Love this mini Juicy roller.  </li>
      <li>I love the compact size.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it was because I figured it would smell too fruity (yuck!) or overwhelming or immature.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance...hate the purse bottle.  </li>
      <li>It smelled lovely though :)</li>
      <li>Love the rollerball for travel.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the real stuff, and good pricing.</li>
      <li>By far, my favorite fragrance!!</li>
      <li>You can easily carry it in your purse</li>
      <li>If you liked the first Juicy Couture perfume as much as I did, you&#x27;ll be sure to enjoy Viva La Juicy as well!    </li>
      <li>The rollerball it self looked rather cheap.</li>
      <li>It can fit into your purse or pocket.  </li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at how gorgeous this perfume is.  </li>
      <li>it is super strong and concentrated.</li>
      <li>Does smell like the original but its just way to pricy</li>
      <li>I love this and use it up so fast that I have to order another one!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely more floral than the first juicy</li>
      <li>so excited</li>
      <li>flirty in spring/summer, rich in the fall/winter months.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>It smells so unique, fruity and so good, light and fresh, all at the same time.</li>
      <li>Came quickly.</li>
      <li>She loves this scent, and the roller turned out to fit really well in her purse/wallet thing, so she could take it with her!</li>
      <li>A bit pricy, but worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably really worth $5.</li>
      <li>Also great for your purse and fits in a small make up</li>
      <li>Received product fast also!</li>
      <li>had to try first.</li>
      <li>You can get such a better deal at Ulta &amp; Sephora</li>
      <li>It came pretty fast and worked well.</li>
      <li>This was received pretty fast.</li>
      <li>Nice.&lt;br /&gt;It came pretty fast and worked well.</li>
      <li>Nice.&lt;br /&gt;It came pretty fast and worked well.</li>
      <li>When I opened it and tried it, it smelled fine, but 5 minutes later the scent was undectable.</li>
      <li>rollerball itself is nice because you can apply the perfume as much or as little as you would like to your pulse points.  </li>
      <li>For me it&#x27;s smell goes to fast</li>
      <li>Fun scent for young women  from 20&#x27;s-30&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>It has a light scent, nothing to overpowering, and it&#x27;s almost like, an addictive smell.</li>
      <li>( and i don&#x27;t wear that much).   </li>
      <li>It has this rich, deep sweetness that makes a statement but doesn&#x27;t overpower the senses.  </li>
      <li>I think this is a good way to try out a perfume without buying a big bottle in case you are not sure of it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances and my skin is also very sensitive</li>
      <li>it comes in a cute little pink box that says &amp;#34;Viva La Juicy&amp;#34; in gold letters and has gold trim on the sides.  </li>
      <li>This will definitely be one of my new favorites and a staple in my beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>I always stare adoringly at the display of pink boxes and gift sets when I&#x27;m at the mall.  </li>

    <li> Little goes a long with this one. I tend to be on the heavy side when I apply perfume, so this was gone in no time! It smelled lovely though :)</li>
    <li> This is a great perfume! It&#x27;s definitely more floral than the first juicy but it&#x27;s really...lovely. It has a light scent, nothing to overpowering, and it&#x27;s almost like, an addictive smell. It is just so good. Also, the scent lasts a long time, so even after a few hours you can still smell it ( and i don&#x27;t wear that much).   If you liked the first Juicy Couture perfume as much as I did, you&#x27;ll be sure to enjoy Viva La Juicy as well!    Happy Shopping!</li>
    <li> I love having this roller-ball accessory for on the go.  It is not great for all day wear on its own, but is wonderful for freshening up on the go and is the perfect size to fit in any purse cosmetic bag. When you apply it to pulse points it stays on for a long time. Enjoy!!!</li>
    <li> I am addicted to this scent and with it being so compact I can carry it with me anywhere. It fits perfectly in my wristlet.</li>
    <li> My husband usually doesn&#x27;t like me wearing perfume as it&#x27;s over powering, but this is very subtle, and he likes the hint of it. He says you can slightly smell it as I walk buy, so it&#x27;s a hit. A bit pricy, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of jucy Couture, from their clothing line to the perfumes.  I like the scent of this parfum, it&#x27;s not too strong, although has a pleasant scent to it. I LoVe it!</li>
    <li> Love the roller ball aspect, perfect for my purse &amp; travel.</li>
    <li> Came quickly. I love this perfume?</li>
    <li> i like i&#x27;ve never tried the perfume but heard good things. great size for a firt timer my ball stays intact and i do take with when i travel&lt;br /&gt;thanks alot will order a bigger size</li>
    <li> Extremely small tub prob would not but again for that price. Does smell like the original but its just way to pricy</li>
    <li> Seriously this bottle wasn&#x27;t as big as I though. It&#x27;s probably the size of my pinky and the roll ball thing fell off. It&#x27;s probably really worth $5. Save and just buy the bottle.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance. It smells so unique, fruity and so good, light and fresh, all at the same time. It&#x27;s great and I plan to order the body wash next. thank you..it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect size for my purse.  It&#x27;s the real stuff, and good pricing. The only thing, I opened the screw lid and the roller ball was inside the lid. Screwed the lid closed tight and reopened, and I haven&#x27;t had the problem since. I have an issue with perfumes leaking in my purse- well don&#x27;t worry with this one, no leak even if upside down!</li>
    <li> So I bought this Juicy Couture rollerball on a whim about two years ago but for some reason, I was hesitant about trying it.  Maybe it was because I figured it would smell too fruity (yuck!) or overwhelming or immature. But I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at how gorgeous this perfume is.  It has this rich, deep sweetness that makes a statement but doesn&#x27;t overpower the senses.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances and my skin is also very sensitive but this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;On me, I detect some creamy vanilla notes with some woodsy oriental amber and some delicate floral notes to round it out.  It is just a very sexy perfume that compliments my feminine style.  It can be worn anytime, anywhere with any outfit.  It is a perfume for all seasons, too...flirty in spring/summer, rich in the fall/winter months.&lt;br /&gt;What I also like is the packaging...it comes in a cute little pink box that says &amp;#34;Viva La Juicy&amp;#34; in gold letters and has gold trim on the sides.  The perfume itself has a gold cap and has a pink label.  Juicy Couture packages their perfumes beautifully, though.  I always stare adoringly at the display of pink boxes and gift sets when I&#x27;m at the mall.  This will definitely be one of my new favorites and a staple in my beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;The rollerball itself is nice because you can apply the perfume as much or as little as you would like to your pulse points.  It can fit into your purse or pocket.  I definitely want a gift set for my birthday or Christmas.</li>
    <li> It came pretty fast and worked well. also packed well. Nice.&lt;br /&gt;It came pretty fast and worked well. also packed well. Nice.&lt;br /&gt;It came pretty fast and worked well. also packed well. Nice.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it!!! As always amazon sold for a great price, better than anywhere else I looked.</li>
    <li> I love this and use it up so fast that I have to order another one! It&#x27;s so convenient.</li>
    <li> It looked like someone took a small plastic bottle and then glued a fake label onto it. it is not worth ordering</li>
    <li> Love this mini Juicy roller.  It&#x27;s perfect to throw in my makeup bag and take on trips when I can&#x27;t pack the big bottle to fly with.  Smells amazing too!</li>
    <li> By far, my favorite fragrance!! These are the perfect size for my purse!</li>
    <li> Perfect size for a clutch purse or wristlet.  Airplane approved liquid size.  Fun scent for young women  from 20&#x27;s-30&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve gone through at least 3 of them.  They last a few months.  The rollerball application is extremely convenient.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, the smell, people compliment me all the time. Love, Love, Love. Will buy larger one next time. had to try first.</li>
    <li> This was received pretty fast. Good deal but thinking it may be a knockoff cause it doesn&#x27;t smell like the same one I bought at the department store. May use it or give it away.</li>
    <li> This rollerball is awesome for carrying in my purse. A little of this goes a long way. Received product fast also!</li>
    <li> For me it&#x27;s smell goes to fast and it&#x27;s not like the perfume. .that my. Open ion please review the perfume</li>
    <li> This was so small. You can get such a better deal at Ulta &amp; Sephora</li>
    <li> Love it and was delivered on time!! Im so excited</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift this packaged arrived on time and neatly packaged. The rollerball it self looked rather cheap.</li>
    <li> This is my third time for ordering the roll-on fragrance. Perfect for travel or in your purse and will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff...</li>
    <li> Great item to carry in my purse or leave in my car.  Can refresh my parfume whenever I want.  A great gift item.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this gift. She likes the smell a lot. I think this is a good way to try out a perfume without buying a big bottle in case you are not sure of it.</li>
    <li> with the right dilution ratio, this tiny bottle can outlast at least 2 3.5 oz sized big money bottles. it is super strong and concentrated. I personally don&#x27;t like the scent, but my sister wanted it for Christmas</li>
    <li> She loves this scent, and the roller turned out to fit really well in her purse/wallet thing, so she could take it with her!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume. Love the rollerball for travel. Also great for your purse and fits in a small make up bag&lt;br /&gt;Awesome price. And great to order on amazon. Hard to find this size in the stores</li>
    <li> Received this perfume. Didn&#x27;t think it would smell as good as it does.  I love the compact size.  You can easily carry it in your purse</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance...hate the purse bottle.  It all leaked out!  I had the lid on as tight as it would go too.  Very disappointing.  Don&#x27;t buy this purse sized bottle!</li>
    <li> This item came not in a package or on a paper product card but in a small resealable clear generic bag. When I opened it and tried it, it smelled fine, but 5 minutes later the scent was undectable. The gift recipient also noticed that the scent didnt last. Very disappointing.</li>
