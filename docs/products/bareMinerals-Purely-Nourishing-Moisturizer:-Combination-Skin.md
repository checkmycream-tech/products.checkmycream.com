      <li>If you try to contact the company about this issue they get very defensive, which makes me think that the issue is much more widespread than you would think after reading a couple of\\&quot;acne\\&quot; reviews.</li>
      <li>I honestly believe it is my super sensitive skin and not the product.</li>

      <li>They advise you to see your dermatologist and test which one of the 100+ ingredients you might be allergic to, and in not so many words pretty much insinuate that you might be delusional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This moisturizer goes on smoothly and is very silky.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  I use it morning and night.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin so I&#x27;m very picky about the face creams I use. I love this moisturizer because it is so lightweight but very moisturizing at the same time. It has a pleasant and refreshing smell. I&#x27;ve used it everyday for almost 2 years now and I always get complimented on my skin. However, for really sunny days that I know I&#x27;m going to be out I&#x27;d go for one with SPF.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to review a moisturizer for the benefit of others, as skin is like fingerprints...no two exactly alike. That said, rather than giving credit to highly personalized positive or negative experiences with a product, I will explain my skin in detail to help you determine if this may be the product for you. Because for me, it is my one and only. Every time I cheat on it, I pay the price. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom has very dry skin, my dad has very oily skin, and I ended up with True Combination Skin--dry patches and oily patches, large pores combined with tiny pores, and the oil and dead, dry skin all seemed to get trapped in my small pores...ugh!! I also have hormone imbalances that contribute to acne, and struggled with acne in spells as I hit puberty and went through adolescence, with it at its absolute worst actually from the ages of 18-23. Though the acne improved as I got older, I still struggled to find the right moisturizer--my skin can get VERY shiny, especially in the summer months. I go through Clean &amp; Clear oil blotting papers like mad! For many years I thought the oiliness meant that I just didn&#x27;t need a moisturizer, but when I realized it was dry, dead skin that was causing breakouts, I changed my tune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried several other mid-range products for \\&quot;hopeless\\&quot; skin--Hope in a Jar was nice, but still slightly too heavy, leaving me shiny. Clinique&#x27;s \\&quot;Dramatically Different\\&quot; moisturizer wasn&#x27;t nearly enough, leaving me scaly. I was feeling like Goldilocks until I found this product--I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long, since I&#x27;ve been a dedicated Bare Minerals makeup user for eight years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately I noticed that it kept my skin SOFT--when I cleanse at night, the skin under my hands feels baby smooth, not scaly or bumpy. My breakouts (to which I&#x27;m still occasionally prone, at 30) stopped almost completely. My skin glowed more than it shone. I am a happy, happy girl with my BareMinerals Combo Skin moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I ranout and had such a hectic time of travel and other major life events that I relied on whatever else I had on hand for over a month. It was a disaster! The dead skin built up, my skin felt super dry at night when I washed, tight after toweling off, and the breakouts returned. Even now, a week or two after finally being reunited with my beloved product, I&#x27;m working on extracting the last of the clogged pores my neglect caused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your story sounds at all like mine, find yourself a sample of this product and see how you do. For me, I have no reason to ever look elsewhere until the next stage of my skin&#x27;s life! (And when that time comes, you better believe my first go-to will be the Dry Skin formula!)</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. Amazon had a good price for item.</li>
    <li> It feels light yet moisturizes perfectly.  I have sensitive combination skin and this product is amazing.  I was using Dermologica, but I got this as a free sample from Ulta.  I must say, I usually throw out the samples because they are usually horrible, but I tried this one.  Boy, am I glad.  I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  Amazing!</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 1 week now. I have to say that I love it. I was very skeptical when buying this product because I have sensitive combination skin and all the moisturizers I&#x27;ve used before either broke me out badly or didn&#x27;t do anything to help my dry skin. So after using the cleanser of this brand, I decided to buy this moisturizer. It makes my skin brighter and smoother. I also notice that my pore gets smaller too, wonder if it is the work of the cleanser or moisturizer. But anyway, I just love my skin now, finally.</li>
    <li> Within two days of using this product, my skin broke out in a severe red, bumpy, itchy and fiery rash across my cheeks and nose. Within four days the rash moved to my eye brows and eyelids. I had also been using an acne face wash which I thought was the culprit but stopped using that product and continued to use this product. After stopping the other product but continuing to use this and seeing it spread across my face I realized this was the culprit which surprised me since Bare Escentuals caters to people with sensitive skin - I have rosacea and acne. Today is the first day I did not use the product and my skin has already improved but is still red and itchy. I have since read reviews on other sites that indicate that this has happened to numerous other people. I will be returning this product but will still use my Bare Mineral make up products as I have never had any issues with them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked high and low for skin care products that don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive, red, break-out prone...yet dry and flaky...skin.  My search is over.  I&#x27;ve spent literally thousands of dollars over the years, trying every new product I can find, and realizing that they were only empty promises.  This one delivers.  I&#x27;ve been using the Bare Minerals Purifying Facial Cleanser, Origins Mega-Mushroon Skin Relief Serum, and this AMAZING Bare Minerals Purely Nourishing Moisturizer for combination skin,and my skin has been completely transformed.  It is calm, moisturized, the tone is even, the irritation and redness are COMPLETELY gone, the flakes are gone, and I am NOT breaking out at all.  I haven&#x27;t had skin this good since I was a child.  This regimen is worth its weight in gold.  My skin texture is like satin, and there is a soft glow I can&#x27;t even describe.  It is almost like my skin is candlelit from within.  Hard to believe someone would gush about skin care, but if you have miserable skin like I had, try it and you&#x27;ll gush too.</li>
    <li> When I bought this product, I was expecting the quality of Bare Escentuals. When I started using the cream, it came out as it should.  In just a few pumps of the cream, it stopped working. I tried to unscrew the top to unplug the pump.  At that point I saw there was no more cream in the bottle.  So I paid for a full bottle and got a few pumps out of the whole thing.  It was as if I was sold a used bottle of cream.  I will not be buying their creams again.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this along with the eye cream and the face wash from my neighbor whose husband was doing some kind of work for the company.  It feels great!  My skin tends to feel tight and uncomfortable when I don&#x27;t use a moisturizer.  I usually use oil of olay and this feels (and looks) less greasy, but still makes my skin feel great.  I did happen to break out a little during my first week using it but I don&#x27;t think it was because of the cream and it went away.  I&#x27;ll probably start buying this instead of olay at least for daytime use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer. Before this I had been using drug store brand daily moisturizers that did little for my skin. I am a teenage girl with relatively clear skin, but its very oily in some places, so while trying to combat that I often dry out others. Moisturizers in the past haven&#x27;t been able to help me for this because they were for specifically dry or oily skin. This moisturizer keeps my entire face feeling soft and smooth without being overly oily. It also has a very pleasant scent and feels nice and light on my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now and I still have almost a full tube left because I only need a very small amount to cover my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely plan on ordering this again.</li>
    <li> I always return to this lotion after trying other stuff. So far I can&#x27;t find anything better for the same price. Moisturizes, makes skin baby soft and silky.</li>
    <li> My husband and I are sharing this account, so this review is not written by a man in case you are wondering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful with this product. It&#x27;ll either leave you happy, like some other reviewers here, or miserable. I tried it twice - about a year ago and just a couple of weeks ago, and both times it caused a pretty bad allergic reaction. I got skin rash everywhere I applied this lotion - within about 36 hours on my face and neck and within about 72 hours on my hands. For about a week my skin looked and felt like orange peel and no amount of makeup could cover the rash. I was not using any other new product at the same time, so nothing else could have caused the skin reaction, and once I stopped using the moisturizer, my skin cleared within about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bare Minerals hush bad reviews on their website. I noticed that the only bad reviews that they published for this product said that after using this moisturizer women got acne break out on their faces. I have yet to see \\&quot;acne\\&quot; breaking out on one&#x27;s neck or one&#x27;s hands. I have combination skin, so I could get acne break out sometimes on my forehead or nose or chin, but never on my cheeks or neck (or hands). I see why BE only allowed those reviews - acne sounds much more innocent than allergies and skin rash, especially on top of their claim that their products are \\&quot;dermatologically tested\\&quot;. I submitted 2 reviews for their website, the second being as toned down as possible and in complete compliance with their published guidelines and both were rejected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using their makeup for over 5 years and it has never caused any skin problems, but their skincare that they are very actively promoting (they never seem to run out of free samples) is apparently quite unsafe for some people with sensitive skin. If you try to contact the company about this issue they get very defensive, which makes me think that the issue is much more widespread than you would think after reading a couple of\\&quot;acne\\&quot; reviews. They advise you to see your dermatologist and test which one of the 100+ ingredients you might be allergic to, and in not so many words pretty much insinuate that you might be delusional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you still want to try this product, do yourself a favor and test it first on a small area of your hand or neck and wait for at least 72 hours. If you don&#x27;t develop any skin rash, it&#x27;s most likely safe for you. If you do, don&#x27;t make a mistake I saw some other girls/women make, do not continue using it hoping that your skin \\&quot;might get used to the ingredients\\&quot;. If you are allergic to this product it would be akin to rubbing poison ivy over your face and hoping that your skin will get adjusted.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin &amp; this seems to make it worse even though it was recommended for my skin type &amp; is labeled combination.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer goes on smoothly and is very silky. It absorbs into the skin well and quickly. I don&#x27;t think it is the right amount of moisture for my skin (I bought the combination skin) as I still had dry patches on my chin and nose.</li>
    <li> Smells really strange and made my skin feel strange like it was spoiled maybe just me, but I do not like this, sticking with Oil Of Olay and Dr. Perricone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yuck</li>
    <li> I have combination , dry and normal skin. It does nothing for the dry patches. I love the make-up still.</li>
    <li> I am not a huge fan of lotion in general and the slimy feeling it leaves on my hands but this moisturizer is different.  This is so light. It leaves me with soft skin and does not take long to soak in. It is perfect for application right before your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and break out easily in the t-zone. Once I started using this moisturizer and bareMinerals face wash together, I have had no issues.  I tried to switch to others and every time, I breakout again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle is extremely deceptive though. It is tall and thin, with a pump that it just the right amount, but IT IS ONLY 1.7 ounces. It is conveniently labeled on the back of the bottle so that when you see it in the store, you feel like you are buying more. When it runs out, stick a q-tip into the container to clean out the last bit and you will see what I am talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fact of the matter is that I keep going back to buy it. It&#x27;s that nice.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. I have very sensitive skin and any time I try a product out I always run the risk of a disaster. When I tried the product out many years ago I loved it from the moment I tried it. I never got the typical reaction I get with other products: hot red skin, burning around the eyes, super shiny t-zone and dried out patches. This product was perfect from the start. My skin feels balanced and I don&#x27;t worry about my baby giving me kisses and licking my face when I have the cream on. I also used it during pregnancy and I loved it then too.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever had. Fresh, clean, all natural scent and it makes my skin feel great!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer makes my skin soft and it smells great too!  Not a bad price, and it lasts a pretty long time.  It has a great light lavender smell that never gets too intense.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now and don&#x27;t really see the need to use anything else!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts and this is one of the only products that keeps me moisturized without causing breakouts. It&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for your face!😍</li>
    <li> Works well, not oily, and a pleasant smell. I keep using this product and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed me yet. a</li>
    <li> This is a great product and am very happy with it will continue to use it repeatedly in the future</li>
    <li> I am a loyal BE customer, from face wash to make up, it is all I use and this moisturizer is amazing.</li>
    <li> Best paired with the Bare Escentuals Face Wash. Ive tried other products but this moisturizes my face with out making it oily.</li>
    <li> i happily received this item. i have used this for years. it arrived in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> This combined with the bare minerals face wash is wonderful. Perfect balance of being moisturizing without being greasy. Works great on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love the BareMinerals products. They do as they promise, no matter whether it is skin care or make-up. I just happen to be hyper sensitive when it comes to moisturizers. I applied this twice and both eyes swelled and the skin turned red. I honestly believe it is my super sensitive skin and not the product.</li>
    <li> My moisturizer of choice.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this product. This moisturizer is great for any skin type, winter and summer, there is no difference. It is very light on the skin, and you can apply makeup with 2 or 3 minutes later. It will keep your skin feeling wonderful especially if you also use the Bare Minerals makeup.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. I have skin that is oily and acne-prone, but also has dry, flaky patches. This provides the moisture I need for the dry areas without making me break out or feel greasy. The price is fantastic as well!</li>
    <li> I like this as a moisturizer, I can&#x27;t use it everyday or it will make my face greasy, but I alternate with other products that cuase my face to get dry. The scent is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d gotten a small packet sample of this from Sephora awhile back and loved it. When I received the actual bottle it was exactly like my experience with the small packet. It adds the extra moisture I need for my otherwise dry skin. A must during the winter months!</li>
    <li> This is the first moisturize I&#x27;ve come across that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out, feel oily, or cause my skin to flake. I use it after the deep foaming cleanser with a sprinkle of the exfoliating powder. Together they are the first skin care regiment that has worked for me and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is not too oily but also provides enough moisture to ensure my skin is hydrated all day. It gets dry in the shower after washing my face and I put it on every morning before my makeup. I do wish it had SPF but my other makeup does so it&#x27;s not a huge issue.</li>
    <li> I like the Purely Nourishing, very much</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> This is a good face moisturizer. It isn&#x27;t anything spectacular, but it does the trick.. I have normal skin and just have issues with dry spots... it doesn&#x27;t work great for dry spots and peeling skin... it is good as a general daily moisturizer though...It isn&#x27;t too greasy or to dry like other moisturizers.. and it smells AMAZING. It has a bit of an Aveda type smell (but less potent)... so if you like Aveda products, you will like the smell of this.</li>
    <li> Light not greasy. Purely Nourishing hydrated my skill well. It doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasent smell but it works great!</li>
    <li> I have VERY combination skin and this works wonders for me. It hydrated where I need it and it&#x27;s too heavy in other areas. It&#x27;s a very smooth texture and leaves my skin happy and soft. I continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> This is labeled appropriate for combination skin. That, my friends, is a lie. I have oily skin and this greasy moisturizer only makes my oily skin worse. Also, the stuff smells pretty nasty. Do not purchase this.</li>
    <li> I have pretty dry skin and I hate applying lotion that I can still feel on my face. After I apply this there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any \\&quot;residue\\&quot; feeling but my skin does feel more moisturized. You definitely have to use this at least twice a day to see any difference in dry skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great for my combination skin!  It has just the right amount of moisture (at least in the summer) that it moisturizes my dry skin without leaving the rest of my skin oily.  It&#x27;s my daily go-to lotion now.</li>
    <li> Not greasy at all and light weight.</li>
    <li> The exact same wonderful product from Bare Escentuals at an Amazon price.  Great deal.&lt;br /&gt;Been using this product line from the inception.  Wouldn&#x27;t switch for anything.  I do not have great skin.  I use great product.  I regularly receive complements on my 58 yr. old skin, Never on my \\&quot;Makeup\\&quot;.  Isn&#x27;t that what we all want from out products?&lt;br /&gt;This is a light, quickly absorbing, non-sticky or greasy daily moisture.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I rated it a four star because I like it. It is perfect on my skin and works pretty good so far. There is no sign of affect or anything. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> First of all, I am extremely allergic to bare minerals makeup because of the high amounts of zinc oxides and other natural sunscreen minerals in it. And btw that is not uncommon. Bare minerals is not for everyone but their skincare line did work well for my skin. I have used many others that made my face redder than a strrawberry and very itchy. This moisturizer is not very greasy which is awesome for my oily parts but does make it soft and moisturized. I would recommend trying it because everyones skin is different and it does work!</li>
    <li> I tried this as a sample and liked it enough to buy it. My local beauty salon was offering 10% off but before buying, I always check with Amazon and sure enough Amazon had the best price.  It&#x27;s very light and feels good on my skin.  I put it on in the morning under foundation.</li>
    <li> The results aren&#x27;t instant but great things take their time. This is my second week using the Purely Nourishing Moisturizer and I&#x27;m starting to see results. slow and steady wins the race!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who can afford it because let&#x27;s face it, with the economy not improving, we poor people can&#x27;t afford to buy this every time it runs out and I think it&#x27;s pricy but others might argue it&#x27;s a reasonable price. yeah sure, only cause they can afford it. I saved every dime and it was worth it honestly so I&#x27;ll continue to be a penny pincher for everything else to buy this again. I&#x27;m also going to experiment with other Bare Minerals products hopefully they don&#x27;t let me down because so far I really like this.</li>
    <li> To begin, I already love this brand and have for about five years now. But i have never decided to try the bare escentuals skin care line. I preferred to use their other line of products called md formulations, which i also love. But i never ever use moisturizers. Dont get me wrong, i definitely need it. I get flakey dry skin from time to time. But it is still awful and unattractive, not to mention uncomfortable. I tried many many many moisturizers but they either leave me feeling like there is a film left behind, or it doesnt moisturize at all, or it doesnt absorb and just sits on your face making it impossible to apply make-up afterwards.  But this moisturizer is so different. It absorbs perfectly and almost immediately and actually moisturizes my skin. No more flakes or tight discomfort, and it also doesnt make my skin oily! This moisturizer is absolutely wonderful and works miracles. I wish i had tried it sooner. A purchase that you will definitely not regret.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t mind the clay smell, my teenage daughter says it is the best moisturizer running...  The price, that&#x27;s harder for Dad to appreciate!</li>
    <li> Bought this at the store and I am buying it again and this is why:&lt;br /&gt;1. I have combination skin, dry and oily. I live in a hot and humid tropical country where is easy for me to get oily skin. THIS is the only moisturizer I have ever had that actually works and doesnt make my skin oily.&lt;br /&gt;2. I love how light weight it is!!! Sometimes I dont feel like putting anything on my face but still want to take care of my skin, this is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;3. I work on a coffee QC lab so I cant have any strong smell on my hair, face or clothes, this is the first moisturizer that works perfectly for me in that department as well.&lt;br /&gt;4. I dont breakout as much anymore.</li>
    <li> I got this in a sample size when I purchased my bare minerals kit, and I loved it.  There&#x27;s no chemically smell, it&#x27;s not too oily, or too dry.  It&#x27;s perfect for my normal skin.  Parabens and other chemicals make my eyes water and itch, and this does neither.  It&#x27;s exactly what I got in the sample, and I&#x27;m pleased with the size.  I have no suggestions or complaints about the product.  HOpe it works as well for you, it&#x27;s my favorite facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because it does the job for all seasons! I like that It is smooth and dries quickly, allowing make to go on evenly.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I can feel my pores sucking it up. this doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or tacky once rubbed in either. Also no shiny look.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer! Keeps skin moist without a greasy feel. I use it morning and night, and I never feel dry or oily.</li>
    <li> Love BareMinerals and I don&#x27;t use any other product. I love the way this moisturizer makes my skin feel. I don&#x27;t particularly like the scent but would not stop using it just for that reason.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Great delivery time, tx!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Bare Escentuals makeup for two years now and finally decided to try their skin care products as well. Like many women, I&#x27;ve spent way too much money trying oodles of moisturizers, but I think I&#x27;ve finally found the one I&#x27;ll stick with. My skin soaks this up and continues to feel super moisturized, but not oily. This is made for combination skin and strikes the perfect balance for me. I will definitely buy this again!</li>
