      <li>ALL BETTER.</li>
      <li>I really like how this lip balm feels and it lasts a good amount of time.</li>
      <li>Now I know what to get as a special &amp;#34;I love you&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>This is worth every penny!</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do anything special and didn&#x27;t even feel as moisturized as Chapstick.</li>
      <li>Love this product works great but smells a little like pledge!</li>
      <li>I started to notice that more time was going by without reaching for chapstick and that was really unusual for me.</li>
      <li>I use other eminence products as it&#x27;s a great line.</li>
      <li>must have for anyone interested!</li>
      <li>They have great natural ingredients and really last.  </li>

      <li>Great, long lasting lip balm.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s very hydrating and lasts for hours without having to reapply.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s non-addicting, natural, and worth every penny.</li>
      <li>It is a bit more expensive than other balms (most of which contain petroleum, which I learned actually dries your lips out) but my lips feel great and are never chapped.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than my La Mer lip balm I spent $50 for!</li>
      <li>Otherwise I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>This was a gift for my new daughter-in-law</li>
      <li>That and the cap on some containers doesn&#x27;t close firmly and tends to fall off easily.  </li>
      <li>Like it but not sure if it does anything special enough to be worth the price.</li>
      <li>It leaves my lips feeling great in this cold Seattle weather.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
      <li>Very smooth and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I mean for the cost I thought … MEH, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>Too expensive , and I really did not see much different in my lips .Now and going to use that money to buy products and do my own lip balms .</li>
      <li>but it lasts long, depends on usage but its thick to stay good for few hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Being a non-purse-carrying male I find it kind of hard to carry it around since it leaves an odd looking bump in whatever pocket I put it in.  </li>

    <li> The best stuff ever to moisturize lips.  It is not greasy, one tiny little bit goes a long way. It works instantly.</li>
    <li> I came across eminence products at one of the Spas where my esthetician used it on me and I asked her what she used. It leaves my lips feeling great in this cold Seattle weather.&lt;br /&gt;Its expensive but it lasts long, depends on usage but its thick to stay good for few hours.&lt;br /&gt;I believe in organic products. And I am in love with Eminence products now.&lt;br /&gt;~Sakshi</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted ...</li>
    <li> I love lip balm. And I love Eminence but this one missed the mark for me. The tub is kind of awkward and you have to put your finger in it to apply. I wish the consistency was a little softer and the packaging smaller.</li>
    <li> Product is some of the best lip balm.  Vendor was good too</li>
    <li> Great lip balm. Very smooth and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I use this daily even under lipstick and my lips have improved drastically.  I use other eminence products as it&#x27;s a great line.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this lip balm and i dont use any other lip balms or chapsticks since buying this. it hydrates my lips for soo long after applying and lasts a really long time. im an eminence junkie and this is a staple must have for anyone interested! i am now on my second jar, and it lasted me 4 or 5 months with regular application every day. really nice light citrus smell. i will definitely be buying again and again!</li>
    <li> I really like how this lip balm feels and it lasts a good amount of time. What I notice most is that once it is off from time or eating, I don&#x27;t feel the need to re-apply immediately! I usually put on chapstick all day long...no kidding, every hour if not more. I started to notice that more time was going by without reaching for chapstick and that was really unusual for me. I like the softness and the citris scent.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest downfall of this product is the packaging!!!!!!! I don&#x27;t like putting my finger or nail in the product and it makes it very difficult to take out with me because I don&#x27;t want to put germs in the lip balm or on my lips. I tried using a lip brush, but I also don&#x27;t like cleaning that off in public even though it helped me use less product.&lt;br /&gt;Please put in a squeeze tube so I can travel with this!!!</li>
    <li> so happy to have found a good quality lip balm that doesn&#x27;t get my skin hooked on anything and I can just use it when I need to.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It&#x27;s very hydrating and lasts for hours without having to reapply. It&#x27;s better than my La Mer lip balm I spent $50 for! My Eminence citrus lip balm is a keeper!!</li>
    <li> Too expensive , and I really did not see much different in my lips .Now and going to use that money to buy products and do my own lip balms .</li>
    <li> I love these products! They have great natural ingredients and really last.  You don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying this balm and you get instant hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my new daughter-in-law and I got it at my son&#x27;s prompting. He said she loves the stuff, had used it before but wouldn&#x27;t sink money into buying another bottle. She was thrilled to get it! Now I know what to get as a special &amp;#34;I love you&amp;#34; gift to her..</li>
    <li> I wear this everyday. It only takes a little to last for a few hours. Smells and feels great.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift from my esthetician about 5 months ago. I tried it once and wasn&#x27;t totally impressed… I mean for the cost I thought … MEH, it&#x27;s ok. BUT WAIT… there&#x27;s more. About a week ago, with the dry winter in Arizona, my lips were not only chapped but the outline of my lips felt tight and so uncomfortable. I did as directed by esthetician and slathered it on. All afternoon my lips felt nice. Then, I slathered it on before bed. Woke up with them feeling nice. Then, I applied once more later that day. ALL BETTER. So, I&#x27;m now a firm believer in this stuff. I love it for healing my winter dry and chapped lips. It&#x27;s non-addicting, natural, and worth every penny. I will buy one when mine runs out.</li>
    <li> Like it but not sure if it does anything special enough to be worth the price.</li>
    <li> I had very dry lips they were starting to crack and peel but after one day aplying this lip balm about 4 times I could tell a huge difference! This is worth every penny! Love this product works great but smells a little like pledge!</li>
    <li> Drop the price $15 for 5 stars</li>
    <li> Remarkable.  Love eminence and love this lip balm.  Soothing, long lasting.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I used to go through 2-3 tubes of chapstick a month, now I use this lip balm twice a day - tops - and a container lasts 4 months or longer.  It is a bit more expensive than other balms (most of which contain petroleum, which I learned actually dries your lips out) but my lips feel great and are never chapped.  The only downside for me is the container it comes in.  Being a non-purse-carrying male I find it kind of hard to carry it around since it leaves an odd looking bump in whatever pocket I put it in.  That and the cap on some containers doesn&#x27;t close firmly and tends to fall off easily.  Otherwise I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great, long lasting lip balm. Got it at a spa once, it felt so nice I had to purchase it.</li>
    <li> A mainstay in my purse.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money. It didn&#x27;t do anything special and didn&#x27;t even feel as moisturized as Chapstick. It didn&#x27;t last as long as everyone said because you need a lot to feel moisturized. After 5 months it&#x27;s almost gone, just using once a day at night. Also, I have having to put a finger in the jar. It seems wasteful (you never transfer all from finger to lip). If you want a good balm/light gloss that smells great and feels amazing, try Sarah Happ&#x27;s lip gloss in the tube.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live with out this stuff!!!!!! It&#x27;s not drying, I use it in the am under lip gloss and then again before bed. My lips stay moist and plump looking. I&#x27;m on my 3rd one in just 2 years. Lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I have very dry lips that peel a lot.  This has helped immensely.  I only wish it was in stick form as it gets under my nails ... I use that for cuticle softening : )</li>
