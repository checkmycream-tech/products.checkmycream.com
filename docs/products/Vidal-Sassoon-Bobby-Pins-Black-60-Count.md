      <li>More words were required for the review.</li>
      <li>Glad</li>
      <li>Not the kind that go sideways when you try to put them in or the kind that rust at the first sight of water.</li>
      <li>Great price, high quality.</li>
      <li>To be honest, I needed an cheaply priced item to get the free shipping on another purchase on Amazon.</li>

      <li>They tend to bend easily, and that&#x27;s one of my concerns.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> so I could get free shipping.  They don&#x27;t hold that great.  They just arent as strong as other bobby pins Ive gotten in the past.  I have thick, curly hair and they don&#x27;t hold at all.  My daughter has medium hair and they barely hold her hair.  If you use these, be prepared to use more than you are used to in order to get it to hold.</li>
    <li> I like how these bobby pins&#x27; design is wavy on top because it could hold my thick hair better than those straight ones.</li>
    <li> i brought this bobby pins because of the constant struggle of finding them with a slight curve to them, and always loosing them. it is worth price and so far they are durable and reliable.</li>
    <li> I mean, its a good price.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re not \\&quot;high quality\\&quot; or anything.&lt;br /&gt;Theyre normal bobby pins, 2 inches, and they do their job. Im satisfied with them. (:&lt;br /&gt;The item came in like 2 days, and that was because of Sunday, then memorial day.&lt;br /&gt;It was superrr fast. (:</li>
    <li> Needed a add on item for my order. Glad I bought these, me and my daughter use them all the time. Great price, high quality. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift on a wishlist, receiver was happy with the product.</li>
    <li> These pins are very flimsy.  Every time I try to spread one open, it twists on itself.  I feel like I&#x27;m going to have to throw each one out after one use.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t have the same hold as other brands I have used. Will prob. end up in the trash. Such a waste of money!</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon Bobby Pins, Black, 60 Count great hair pins and they hold the hair in place. Great hair pins for the price.</li>
    <li> I use Bobby Pins often on my hair and also my daughters hair and these work well. They stay in the hair well and my daughter has the thickest hair that we put it up in buns. I do recommend these to others.</li>
    <li> Grabbed these as an add-on item to equal out to free shipping. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying this, but I&#x27;m actually disappointed in these bobby pins. They stretch out if you put any thickness of hair in them to the point that they are unusable after one use. Go for the Goody brand instead.</li>
    <li> They are bobby pins. They work fine. More words were required for the review. This is enough, now, finally. The end.</li>
    <li> I do not have much to say about plain bobby pins.  They are firm and hold my hair in place when I am securing my twists or when I want to pin a section of hair.  They work fine.</li>
    <li> So bobby pins... I just needed an add-on. These weren&#x27;t that bad, but not the best quality either. They are just used on occasion for me, but they&#x27;re not the first thing I reach for to pin back my hair. The price is cheap so there was nothing to lose.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an easy buy. It&#x27;s a good buy. I would absolutely purchase these ones again. They work very very well</li>
    <li> Bobby Pins aren&#x27;t really too hard to master, I would think - but as far as Bobby Pins go these are good.  They have a coating that doesn&#x27;t come off, are sturdy and don&#x27;t bend/break when I use them, and hold well.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> They slide in your hair with ease&lt;br /&gt;They make styling such a breeze&lt;br /&gt;But beware, mon frere&lt;br /&gt;They will cover your counters like fleas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these are solid bobby pins.  I see a lot of negative remarks and those might stem from not knowing how to use a bobby pin (I know that might sound ridiculous but the wavy texture is designed to grip your hair in place and the flat side is meant to push it down and hold it in the grooves) or maybe from using too few bobby pins in thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price, good product. Will buy again when I inevitably lose all the ones I have right now.</li>
    <li> These are nice quality bobby pins. I&#x27;ve had cheap ones before, but these are of great quality. Don&#x27;t fall out of your hair.</li>
    <li> The color matches my hair well, but these do not stay in.  I have quite thick hair and I pretty much have to throw these away after each use.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Exactly what you&#x27;d expect out of a bobby pin -- nothing fancy here. Good quality pin, the paint seems to adhere without chipping and getting everywhere.</li>
    <li> These are great bobby pins. There ends are coated so they don&#x27;t latch on to your hair and break it. They are easy to put on and take off and don&#x27;t slip.</li>
    <li> They were okay. I think that someone who actually needed bobby pins would like them. And if your like me, they do the job.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t hold my hair, i got better results from dollar store bobby pins. The ends of the bobby pins were too open and they don&#x27;t keep the hair inside the bobby pin.</li>
    <li> My wife ordered these and I am commenting as a joke. LOL. What can you say about a bobby pin anyway?</li>
    <li> If you wear bobby pins a lot you probably know that the cheaper ones tend to have really skimpy rubber tips that cause hair pulling and skull poking.  These don&#x27;t do that. So there&#x27;s all you need to know, otherwise they are just like every other bobby pin I wear.</li>
    <li> I found the price to be good when compared to other brands.  These hold your hair well and look just as pictured.</li>
    <li> Great value, great product. I received exactly what I ordered and was very pleased with it overall. Will order again.</li>
    <li> They are very weak. not strong at all. all. i wanted them was for to hold my bangs out of my eye and it just slides out in seconds.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t too much to say about these! The work just like they are suppose to. I got these as an add on for a cheap price. It&#x27;s nice to be able to add these small items on to your order.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say other than these are exactly what you would think bobby pins would be. Great as an add-on item, though. This was before I had prime so it was perfect to push me over the threshold.</li>
    <li> These bobby pins don&#x27;t stay put in my hair and definitely don&#x27;t hold back strands of hair in place. Poor purchase.</li>
    <li> Figured if I buy a \\&quot;salon brand\\&quot; that I&#x27;d get some fancy looking bobby pins, lol. No, not really. They&#x27;re all the same to me. Purchased this when it was on sale, so better price than in the store. Free shipping too since I had over $25 in my cart. Hooray! ;]</li>
    <li> I love the fact that when you order this product it comes with 60!! More than enough for one person. So I gave some to my sister and still have. More than enough :D</li>
    <li> I love these pins! great price! Great value! Make gorgeous hair styles and don&#x27;t slip out of my hair. Don&#x27;t rub off so quickly.</li>
    <li> The pins quality are very good and it&#x27;s not hurting hair at all. A good price and a good product.</li>
    <li> This product is very good. It does not break of my hair and holds it very well. Purchase went smoothly.</li>
    <li> Simply put, these were just the extra item for free shipping. The hold isn&#x27;t great.. and I have very fine hair. I am just going to recommend the Goody brand. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Kayla xx</li>
    <li> Just an awful product!  Doesn&#x27;t hold hair at all especially fine hair! Don&#x27;t waste your money, not even worth a free shipping filler!</li>
    <li> I am using these bobby pins every day. It does the job...That&#x27;s all I can say. I would recommend this...</li>
    <li> Have you noticed that socks and bobby pins come up missing more than anything else. LoL i had to put this on as an ADD on item. I Have not used these yet. I have used the same before although. They work fine. They latch on nicely . They stay put ..And they don&#x27;t pull you&#x27;re hair out. While taking them off......</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t stay in your hair...might be some sort of strategy to get you to buy more.</li>
    <li> These bobby pins have one job and that is to hold my hair in place when I need them to and they do a fine job of it.  They don&#x27;t slip off easily on their own like the cheapies will.</li>
    <li> Every woman that does up-dos must have these as part of their hair-care cabinet!  Keep those short hairs hiding so your up-do looks perfect!</li>
    <li> Bobby Pins... Yes. Work great for what i use them for... these should last me a few years . solid product</li>
    <li> These do what bobby pins are supposed to do which is hold your hair back. The product is not exceptional but it does the trick.</li>
    <li> not the best quality, but i guess you get what you pay for...&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately these ones do not hold my hair at all, and i&#x27;m not even creating masterpieces!&lt;br /&gt;wouldn&#x27;t buy again - will stick with goody.</li>
    <li> I use it to pluck the earwax out of my ears. Does the job well and is fairly cheap. Great product!</li>
    <li> Great packaging and good quality bobby pins. Having 4 daughters, we go through a lot of bobby pins and I&#x27;ve found that the name brand hold up better than the discount variety. Good value on this &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; item.</li>
    <li> Usually, I would just go to the store to buy this item, but I was busy, and this was cheap....awesome deal!!</li>
    <li> I got these as a filler for free super saver shipping and I love them! They do what bobby pins are supposed to do! No surprises!</li>
    <li> These bobby pins are a little loose. They can hold back my strands most of the time but in windy days I have to readjust them from time to time. But they do not pull my hair as my former bobby pins used to do when I remove them.The only complaint is that they are overpackaged. They can be simply mailed to me in an envelope. I felt guilty receiving them in a box filled with air bags.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I needed an cheaply priced item to get the free shipping on another purchase on Amazon. This purchase did the trick. I tossed the pack aside for a week or so before a family member asked for hairs pins that didn&#x27;t pull her hair out when removed and were not hard to put in her hair. Some pins are hard to push in or scratch the scalp and when being removed they pull hair out! These did not. When I gave them to her, she was skeptical; however, she tool the entire pack! So, this turned out to be a good thing after al!</li>
    <li> these work great for holding my hair in place.  I have no complaints about them at all.  would recommend them</li>
    <li> Almost not worth writing a review just because it&#x27;s such a classic.  But then I realized some people may not actually know how useful these little puppies are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, folks, the classic bobby pin is just a perfect little engineering design.  I like those decorated clips as much as the next gal, but for sheer efficiency and power of hair-holding, nothing beats a good ol&#x27; bobby pin.  These particular ones are nice and strong without pulling your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  I can&#x27;t be the only person who seems to have my bobby pins constantly being stolen by the same gnomes who steal my socks.  Where&#x27;s a bobby pin when you need one??  Now I just buy &#x27;em in bulk and always have extra on hand!</li>
    <li> Vidal sasson always has reliable products. these bobby pins are flexible enough to put in easy, and they come out with minimal pulling, yet they stay put! I will never buy another brand of bobby pin!</li>
    <li> These are the small bobby pins. From the pic you would think they were the large ones you use to roller set your hair but they are not. I will keep them because it would be a hassle to send them back.</li>
    <li> came on time, product just as described, great for holding waterfall braids/twists and curls in place. would recommend  this product.</li>
    <li> There good bobby pins, I like them better than goody. There is no super special about them... they are just bobby pins.</li>
    <li> These bobby pins are too flimsy.  When you open them up to put them in your hair, they do not go back together as tightly as it should.  I would never buy these again.</li>
    <li> Not much too say... they are bobby pins and work great shipped fast, just what I wanted without going to the store to get them!</li>
    <li> Pins are loose and not tight. They do not keep hair pinned very well.</li>
    <li> The smaller size it better than I expected for bangs &amp; Little braids etc.  Glad I added this onto a purchase</li>
    <li> I have thick hair but my individual strands are pretty fine. I had to use a few of them to make hold tight in any given area. The also seemed to loose shape easily.</li>
    <li> Just what a bobby pin should be! These are the basic, basic ones - but they do the job wonderfully!</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t seem to be as strong as regular bobby pins but are cheap and can be layered in to achieve the same result as stronger pins.</li>
    <li> There is no creative way to talk about bobby pins. They are like any other hair pin I have used and I would recommend this product to anyone that needs hair pins. They dont bend out of place, they are pretty tight which is good because I dont have to adjust them throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this pins. Now, I can do an up style and not worry about pieces of hair falling down. No complaints thus far.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as described.  Reviewing them with a &amp;#34;minimum&amp;#34; is ridiculous, they are bobby pins, and they work .</li>
    <li> lol, they are bobby pins. They work. They pin and tuck and hold and keep the battle zones that break out through out the course of the day up in your head in armistice! So, yeah, get some. They work.</li>
    <li> Great price for the quantity you get. This is usually 4 bucks at regular stores. I can afford to lose some of them now :)</li>
    <li> What more can I say?&lt;br /&gt;It looks like a bobby pin,&lt;br /&gt;it acts like a bobby pin,&lt;br /&gt;it must be a bobby pin!</li>
    <li> These bobby pins not only don&#x27;t get loose like others I&#x27;ve bought, but the price is much lower than the retail stores.</li>
    <li> These are pretty much straight forward bobby pins. The one thing i do like is that they are tight and dont lose their shape fast. They last me a long time because i can reuse them so often.</li>
    <li> Completely flimsy and useless. I guess Vidal Sassoon will put their name on anything. A serious disappointment !</li>
    <li> These bobby pins are looser than I hoped, but they do the job fine! They are tighter than the pricier Conair bobbies from Walgreens. I&#x27;m asian and have chin length hair (medium thick &amp; wavy) and need to pin up the shorter hairs on my nape and my bangs when I put my hair in a ponytail. These do not hold a few strands of short hair well, but so far these are the best I have found. They work great overall, and I&#x27;ll be using them for my wedding!! I read somewhere that some people worry about hair damage, so perhaps that is why these are on the looser side, which actually makes them a lot more easy to use. I posted a pic, in case that helps anyone! The distance between the ball ends makes a difference for me, I like that these are not as far apart as Conair.</li>
    <li> These are probably the worst bobby pins that I have ever bought. The price was so low that I was willing to give a try, thinking how bad can they be. Well, they are in every sense \\&quot;bad\\&quot;. They are cheaply made, flimsy, after 10 minutes of being in your hair, they start to fall out on their own. Even sitting still for 10 minutes will not keep them in place. A product that will take up space in your drawer and will not get used.</li>
    <li> They are bobby pins. They serve their purpose as far as I&#x27;ve seen so far. Cheap, bought as an add on.</li>
    <li> Perfect. You can never have too many of these. For some reason, no matter how careful I am to take them out of my hair at night and put them in a cup that I keep just for this purpose, I can never manage to find any when I need them (I suspect the cat).</li>
    <li> I had no issues with these pins. They actually lasted me longer than I thought they would. They tend to bend easily, and that&#x27;s one of my concerns. I got exactly what I paid for. I guess I shouldn&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> I got this item as a part of a gift bag for a coworker, and was not impressed, especially considering the price.  The item came from an independent seller, and it was wrapped in a piece of old, wrinkled brown paper that had rough-cut edges.  The paper looked like it had been used many times, and was not even trimmed nicely.  I am afraid that the person I gave it to will think I just got a cheap gift, even though there were other things in the bag and I had each item wrapped in Christmas paper.  It was very disappointing that the seller did not at least wrap the item in unused paper that had been nicely trimmed.  I might have had a different opinion if that were the case.</li>
    <li> i have very thick, very slick hair. these work as well as any bobby pin i&#x27;ve ever used (which isn&#x27;t many), and they&#x27;re very cheap, so i can&#x27;t complain. i haven&#x27;t tried to use them extensively, so i don&#x27;t know how sturdy they actually are, but they&#x27;re nice to have on hand for flyaways.</li>
    <li> I was looking for the better quality bobby pins because I was finding them at Target.  These are thin and not well made.  I will not be purchasing these again.</li>
    <li> What can you say?&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re Bobby Pins.&lt;br /&gt;I got 60 of them, as described, and they were all in good quality.</li>
    <li> arrived on time.  Happy with everything. I am not sure what else you can say about bobby pins :) Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought these because I have lost most of mine and these are an every day necessity for me! I love these! They work so well with my hair! they stay in place and hold all day! Sometimes I spray them with hairspray and let it dry before I use them because it holds your hair better. They are the perfect size as well! smaller or larger ones do not work for me. I&#x27;ve noticed that with these I don&#x27;t have the crimp line in my hair when I take them out. these are my fav and I recommend them for use by everyone! you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> i got these just to get the 25$ free shipping but my girlfriend says she likes them better than the ones at walmart. they hold better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only gave 4 stars as im sure their not the best and have room for improvement but she liked them and they are super cheap</li>
    <li> these are the only bobby pins that don&#x27;t fall out of my hair! the black doesn&#x27;t chip off like other brands either.</li>
    <li> these are typical, normal bobby pins. They stay in well, they match my hair color and they do the job</li>
    <li> I purchased these bobby pins as an add-on with another purchase.  Great quality and great price.  I&#x27;m loving the new &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; thing to add small items to bigger purchases.  Much easier than remembering to add them to my list for next time I go to store.</li>
    <li> The bobby pins arrived in good condition.  The paint is a nice solid dark color, with good tips. This is not a very strong metal. The clamp loosens and the pins will not hold my hair, often falling out. Very disappointed with the quality. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I mainly only bought this product cuz I was needing it to get to the $25 free shipping, haven&#x27;t used them much but they seem like any others you can buy at the $1 store.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say too much negative about a bobby pin! They hold my hair in place. Don&#x27;t pinch and they match my hair. They are great for a fill in item.</li>
    <li> They do what they are suppose too, and they stay in place not going all over the place like others.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re average bobby pins, but not very strong. They&#x27;re fine if you&#x27;ve lost all yours I guess, but tend to get bent out of shape easily.</li>
    <li> well first off the price was great to me anyway compared to the cheaper ones i buy that evenetually stick me in my head. the bulb at the end is firm and doest come off easily so its definitely worthit.</li>
    <li> I needed an add-on item in order to get free shipping so I decided to buy these, since I keep losing my bobby pins. Right now I only have 30 pins lol and I bought these in December. At least they are cheap and holds the fly away hair good.</li>
    <li> These are the only bobby pins I have ever had in my 60+ years that hold nothing -- just simply fall out. In England, we call bobby pins &amp;#34;grips&amp;#34; -- these are &amp;#34;no grips.&amp;#34; Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Good value for the money. Definitely have more bobby pins than I&#x27;ll ever need but that is a good issue.</li>
    <li> I had to read some reviews about this this product before I wrote my review because I was wondering &amp;#34;How do you go wrong with bobby pins?&amp;#34; For me these are great, I guess because I have think, course hair.  These hold my hair perfectly in place all day and they small enough so they not noticeable, that being said since they small I have to use more of them to hold the hair in place, good thing they come in a pack of 60.  Great price, great filler if you need to have a $25 order for free shipping.</li>
    <li> Enamel peaks of from use of hair spray after these are inserted into hair .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But ok to use if you are not applying anything over your hair after you style with pins.</li>
    <li> These bobby pins have worked very well on my and my daughters&#x27; hair. We all have thick, wavy/curly hair that tends to get a little wild (especially in humidity), and these pins hold our hair in place, they retain their shape, and they are very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also come in handy to unlock various doors in the house (bathroom, bedroom, etc), to hold a bed canopy back when you&#x27;ve lost the sash that is supposed to hold it back, and can keep a small pile of papers together in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, great price!</li>
    <li> what can I say they are bobby pins although I used them to hang miniature lights around my deck and they worked great. my wife got one or two and said they did what they were suppose to do.</li>
    <li> Good value for the buck. Lasted a long time. Dont think i needed so many, so i guess it was worth it .</li>
    <li> They are bobby pins. Not the kind that go sideways when you try to put them in or the kind that rust at the first sight of water. Just quality pins. I will only buy them from here.</li>
    <li> I just bought these for my daughter and so far they work as expected. If I haven&#x27;t come back to update this review it means they are holding up.</li>
    <li> This item is as described and came one day early, i am very happy with the service that was provided to me.</li>
    <li> they are a bit smaller than the ones i typically use but i guess what can you expect from shopping online</li>
    <li> I got these bobby pins for my mom. She said they work well, holding her hair firmly in place, and she likes them. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand some of the earlier reviews; these bobby pins are fantastic. They held my daughter&#x27;s baby fine hair perfectly as well as mine. The end pieces don&#x27;t pop off either like most cheap bobby pins. Also, the description says they are for small pieces of hair... and they are. They aren&#x27;t quite the full-size you usually see, but they aren&#x27;t the baby ones either. These are great for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally got them to get my cart up to $25 for an add-on program item. Def. worth it!</li>
    <li> These bobby pins are very durable and good quality. I&#x27;ve purchased other bobby pins and after one use they expand and don&#x27;t go back to the tight fit. I&#x27;ve used the same bobby pin over and over about 3 times already and it&#x27;s still has the tightness.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to create different styles with my hair.  They fit nice and don&#x27;t fall out too much like other ones I have used in the past.</li>
