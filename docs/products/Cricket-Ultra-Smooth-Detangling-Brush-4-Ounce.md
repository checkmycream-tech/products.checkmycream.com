### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>works wonderful for all the hair types in my house.</li>
      <li>She is a happy person!</li>
      <li>This is the best brush I have EVER purchased for detangling my hair, and of my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
      <li>Great brush!</li>
      <li>IT IS PERFECT!</li>
      <li>Perfect for using on your kids, though!</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>And that she can de-tangle her own hair?!?!  </li>
      <li>It is perfect for that, so I am thrilled with this choice!</li>
      <li>Loved it!</li>
      <li>She had never in her life felt the blissful calming joy of having her hair brushed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Took out some hair but if you have 4a / 3c hair it should do well and great to scrub my scalp and get flakes out</li>
      <li>It is a great price, vice buying it at the salon for $25.</li>
      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>This brush is amazing!</li>
      <li>It was recommended by our hair dresser after she successfully used it on my daughter without tears.</li>
      <li>The ergonomic shape of this brush fits my hand perfect and is easy to hold as it glides through the hair and detangles it.  </li>
      <li>Kid - loved it.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand the good reviews of thous brush.</li>
      <li>she rubbed a lamp and wished for the perfect hairbrush, the genie would not be able to come up with anything better than this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried using it sideways on my own hair, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to get a good grip into my hair.  </li>
      <li>This is a great brush for brushing someone elses hair, for brushing your own hair, there are better options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this brush!</li>
      <li>This lovely brush took her from 25 minutes to untangle her hair to five!</li>
      <li>Amazing brush.</li>
      <li>It is much smaller than it appears in the photo, but has a hook like handle that&#x27;s perfectly sized to hang from the shower caddy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve winced more than once when detangling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Check out my YouTube review of this brush for kinky/curly hair :) [...]</li>
      <li>THIS BRUSH even more than the paddle brush!&amp;#34</li>
      <li>:) She flinches from any touch like a Venus flytrap closes at the slightest breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>but i love this brush because it looks like a tangle teezer but with a handle.</li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>I love the way it feels on my scalp.  </li>
      <li>They are completely smooth.  </li>
      <li>My daughter has super fine hair and swims a lot during the summer.</li>
      <li>Well, that&#x27;s worth six stars!</li>
      <li>Pulls the hair right out!  </li>
      <li>It works great on wet hair, which is one of the reasons why I bought it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This helps with tangles, removing them quite gently with fewer tears than most brushes.</li>
      <li>brush is perfect for thick, curly hair, I bought this brush to help with my 3yr olds tangly curly hair.</li>
      <li>but overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s especially great on wet hear, but also works well on dry hair.  </li>
      <li>However, if you want to brush your own hair, the angle is strange and you may not be so</li>
      <li>self brushing, I highly recommend the original tangle teezer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>also use this brush to brush my 2yr old daughters fine, wavy hair</li>
      <li>Only wish the bristles were a bit more substantial.</li>
      <li>This brush is great for in the shower conditioning and combing my 7 year olds hair thick curly hair.  </li>
      <li>Its super easy to grip and work through my very curly mixed hair.</li>
      <li>I have a thick bunch of fine curly waist length hair which tangles and mats very easy.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really understand how it works</li>
      <li>So much so I have fantisized  about shaving it all off.  </li>
      <li>My Sytlist used this once and said it was so easy to get through my fine but thick hair.  </li>
      <li>We also have a cricket Fast flo mini for in the bath with conditioner(my 14yr old daughter uses a fast flo full sized for use with conditioner in the shower), this brush for just out of the bath or dry hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I will keep it only because it really does get the job done.</li>
      <li>I use it as a baby brush for my 1 year old.</li>
      <li>not only does she allow her hair to be brushed, she is even willing to do it herself.  </li>
      <li>My daughter has thin hair that tangles very easily.</li>
      <li>so does a plastic vegetable brush, so thats not a real test of this brush ;-))</li>
      <li>So detangling your own hair is a bit difficult.  </li>
      <li>However, this proves that this brush is gentle enough for &amp;#34;lesser work,&amp;#34; its not just for thick curly hair&lt;</li>
      <li>The cool design that appears ergonomic in the picture is actually extremely difficult to grasp and then brush your hair with in real life.  </li>

<li> The bristles aren&#x27;t really bristles, rather small plastic spikes.</li>
<li> However my little 9 year old surfer LOVES it.  </li>
<li> My 10 year old daughter has VERY long fine hair, and tons of it, and it tangles so badly.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s very fast--cutting my brush-time down from 15 minutes to de-tangle to just a very few minutes with this brush.</li>
<li> If you have long hair then don&#x27;t buy this brush!!</li>
<li> Well, at least I know that I am not missing anything.  </li>
<li> down when brushing dry hair.</li>
<li> My gosh, the &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; are sharp as hell.</li>
<li> The bristles don&#x27;t have sharp seams or edges.  </li>
<li> Her hair is totaled from the beach, sun and salt and the other night</li>
<li> Not worth the money.</li>
<li> My only complaint is the location of the handle.  </li>
<li> Even though the Cricket detangler is prettier, its bristles don&#x27;t reach down to my scalp.  </li>
<li> The way it&#x27;s designed is to be pulled down with the handle pointing downward like in the photo.  </li>
<li> Thick kinky curly hair and thin straight hair.</li>
<li> I keep wishing I had this brush as a little girl</li>
<li> Me - disliked it.  </li>
<li> you come in with the brush at the wrong angle, it ends up feeling like you&#x27;re being jabbed with several little pin-pricks--all at once.</li>
<li> My hair is very long, thick, and difficult to comb or brush through when wet.</li>
<li> It was larger than expected which isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, in fact I think it is a plus.&lt;br</li>
<li> --It doesn&#x27;t necessarily hurt; however, depending on your level of pain tolerance, it&#x27;s startling to say the least.</li>
<li> least until you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have thick curly hair and the bristles on this are so thin and small</li>
<li> My daughter has very long and very difficult hair to untangle after she washes it.</li>
<li> This brush is very small and difficult to use.</li>
<li> is just weird.</li>
<li> that&#x27;s it&#x27;s useless on my hair.</li>
<li> Brushing has always been painful and tedious.  </li>
<li> HATED HATED HATED it  because it hurt so much.</li>
<li> For 11 years my friend&#x27;s daughter has hated to have ANYTHING touch her hair.</li>
<li> Hate it!</li>
<li> Awful brush!  </li>

    <li> Awful brush!  Pulls the hair right out!  Hate it!</li>
    <li> This brush is very small and difficult to use. If you have long hair then don&#x27;t buy this brush!!</li>
    <li> Yes it does all it claims</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for brushing someone elses hair, for brushing your own hair, there are better options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is perfect for thick, curly hair, I bought this brush to help with my 3yr olds tangly curly hair. It is perfect for that, so I am thrilled with this choice! However, if you want to brush your own hair, the angle is strange and you may not be so pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this brush to brush my 2yr old daughters fine, wavy hair and it works well for her as well(but so does a plastic vegetable brush, so thats not a real test of this brush ;-)) However, this proves that this brush is gentle enough for &amp;#34;lesser work,&amp;#34; its not just for thick curly hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For self brushing, I highly recommend the original tangle teezer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This helps with tangles, removing them quite gently with fewer tears than most brushes. We also have a cricket Fast flo mini for in the bath with conditioner(my 14yr old daughter uses a fast flo full sized for use with conditioner in the shower), this brush for just out of the bath or dry hair. This brush is infused with oils which helps keep the frizz(&amp;static) down when brushing dry hair.</li>
    <li> My Sytlist used this once and said it was so easy to get through my fine but thick hair.  I bought one and don&#x27;t need to apply a detangler or styling product before I run this through my hair.  Amazing!</li>
    <li> Took out some hair but if you have 4a / 3c hair it should do well and great to scrub my scalp and get flakes out</li>
    <li> This brush is great for in the shower conditioning and combing my 7 year olds hair thick curly hair.  It is much smaller than it appears in the photo, but has a hook like handle that&#x27;s perfectly sized to hang from the shower caddy.  The bristles aren&#x27;t really bristles, rather small plastic spikes.</li>
    <li> My 10 year old daughter has VERY long fine hair, and tons of it, and it tangles so badly.  She swears by her &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; brush.  The bristles are very short, so in order to use it fully we have to brush it from over and under her hair.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this on my hair and I went home and immediately ordered one.  It&#x27;s especially great on wet hear, but also works well on dry hair.  My daughter has super fine hair and swims a lot during the summer. It ends up in one giant knot by the end of the day.  I use the cricket before her shower and then again after, and she doesn&#x27;t complain at all about it pulling.  My only complaint is the location of the handle.  The way it&#x27;s designed is to be pulled down with the handle pointing downward like in the photo.  So detangling your own hair is a bit difficult.  I&#x27;ve tried using it sideways on my own hair, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to get a good grip into my hair.  Perfect for using on your kids, though!</li>
    <li> Loved it! Check out my YouTube review of this brush for kinky/curly hair :) [...]</li>
    <li> My daughter has very long and very difficult hair to untangle after she washes it. This lovely brush took her from 25 minutes to untangle her hair to five! She is a happy person!</li>
    <li> The ergonomic shape of this brush fits my hand perfect and is easy to hold as it glides through the hair and detangles it.  I love the way it feels on my scalp.  The bristles don&#x27;t have sharp seams or edges.  They are completely smooth.  I have over 15 brushes that I have purchased over the years and have thrown them into a box that I refer to as the brush grave yard.  I WON&#x27;T BE TOSSING THIS ONE.  IT IS PERFECT!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing! My hair is very long, thick, and difficult to comb or brush through when wet. This brush takes all the snarls out with no pain or damage to the hair! It&#x27;s very fast--cutting my brush-time down from 15 minutes to de-tangle to just a very few minutes with this brush. Even my hair salon uses this one now. Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this because the Kakakiki Kombbrush has such a steep learning curve.  It only works on my hair under running water.  Even though the Cricket detangler is prettier, its bristles don&#x27;t reach down to my scalp.  I might have to use it under running water as well.  I bought it because I thought it was easier to use.  Well, at least I know that I am not missing anything.  If I hadn&#x27;t bought it, I would have kept second guessing purchasing the Kakakiki Kombbrush.  I wanted the Cricket detangler to replace the Kombbrush.  I guess I am stuck with the latter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here in December 2014, I decided to take this brush out of my \\&quot;everything else\\&quot; bin and give it a try under running water.  It detangles my hair while I am in the shower.  It penetrates my hair to the scalp, but only when my hair is soaked with water. I won&#x27;t use it on towel-dried hair. It won&#x27;t penetrate enough to my scalp. Nevertheless, it is a keeper!</li>
    <li> My daughter has thin hair that tangles very easily. She loves this brush and no longer whines about having her hair brushed out.</li>
    <li> For 11 years my friend&#x27;s daughter has hated to have ANYTHING touch her hair. HATED HATED HATED it  because it hurt so much. She screamed and cried until she reached double digits. Now that she is a pre-teen, she only screams. :) She flinches from any touch like a Venus flytrap closes at the slightest breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If she rubbed a lamp and wished for the perfect hairbrush, the genie would not be able to come up with anything better than this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now not only does she allow her hair to be brushed, she is even willing to do it herself.  She had never in her life felt the blissful calming joy of having her hair brushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not exaggerating when I say that this brush has changed her life.</li>
    <li> Ugh, it looks and feels like a cat brush.  The cool design that appears ergonomic in the picture is actually extremely difficult to grasp and then brush your hair with in real life.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I have EVER purchased for detangling my hair, and of my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She no longer cries, and I no longer cry whey I brush her hair!  You cannot beat the price either.</li>
    <li> i have never owned a tangle teezer but i love this brush because it looks like a tangle teezer but with a handle. Its super easy to grip and work through my very curly mixed hair. It was larger than expected which isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, in fact I think it is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;The only think is I wish the bristles were a tad bit longer but overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought several.  Great for tangly hair and for kids who hate to have their hair brushed.  It was recommended by our hair dresser after she successfully used it on my daughter without tears.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It doesn&#x27;t pull at all! I keep wishing I had this brush as a little girl</li>
    <li> Amazing brush. My hairdresser uses it in my girls. Gets through knots without the screaming</li>
    <li> I have to tell you that I did NOT like this brush at all.  However my little 9 year old surfer LOVES it.  Her hair is totaled from the beach, sun and salt and the other night she burst out with &amp;#34;I LOVE THIS BRUSH even more than the paddle brush!&amp;#34;  There you have it.  Me - disliked it.  Kid - loved it.  And that she can de-tangle her own hair?!?!  Well, that&#x27;s worth six stars!</li>
    <li> Only wish the bristles were a bit more substantial.</li>
    <li> I have a thick bunch of fine curly waist length hair which tangles and mats very easy.  Brushing has always been painful and tedious.  So much so I have fantisized  about shaving it all off.  A friend suggested I try this brush before going drastic.  This brush got rid of all the mats and tangles in record time!  Plus it didn&#x27;t hurt!  I don&#x27;t really understand how it works but it does.</li>
    <li> works wonderful for all the hair types in my house. Thick kinky curly hair and thin straight hair. Bought three, may purchase another one!</li>
    <li> My gosh, the &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; are sharp as hell. I&#x27;ve winced more than once when detangling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you come in with the brush at the wrong angle, it ends up feeling like you&#x27;re being jabbed with several little pin-pricks--all at once. --It doesn&#x27;t necessarily hurt; however, depending on your level of pain tolerance, it&#x27;s startling to say the least. --At least until you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep it only because it really does get the job done.</li>
    <li> Great brush! It was reccomended by my hair dresser and I love it. It works great on wet hair, which is one of the reasons why I bought it. It is a great price, vice buying it at the salon for $25.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the good reviews of thous brush. I have thick curly hair and the bristles on this are so thin and small that&#x27;s it&#x27;s useless on my hair. I tried it on my daughter who is 4 and it was too flimsy for her. I use it as a baby brush for my 1 year old.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to my paddle brush.&lt;br /&gt;This is just weird.</li>
