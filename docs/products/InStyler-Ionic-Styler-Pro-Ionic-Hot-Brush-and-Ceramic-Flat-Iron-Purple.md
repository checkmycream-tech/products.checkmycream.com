      <li>did try this out on her friend with baby fine hair and it worked great in giving it body and gave some waves that they were going.  </li>
      <li>Adds tons of body to crown and amazing curls.</li>
      <li>And- at the amazingly affordable price</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s nice,</li>
      <li>Looks nice, its purple and cost $69 plus 25% off at Rite Aid.</li>
      <li>I also liked the straightener to give me a sleek look.  </li>
      <li>the swivel cord is so nice because that keeps the cord from twisting and getting all kinked up.  </li>
      <li>I grew up in the 80&#x27; s and have own a lot of curling irons.</li>
      <li>the nice thing about this is that you can put it close to your scalp or your face and not burn yourself because the plastic bristles give you some protection.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Two stars, because many InStyler products ARE good.</li>
      <li>This iron worked really nicely on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love, love, love this beautiful contraption.  </li>
      <li>This new InStyler is perfect.  </li>

      <li>The instyler is by far the best one!</li>
      <li>This is the best of what I have found and what I have used so far.</li>
      <li>and I got the best results with dry hair, although not as good as the rotating brush irons.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not the most talented at styling my hair, but the Ionic Styler Pro makes it easy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and does not burn my hair!  </li>
      <li>I am amazed with the ease of handling and working with my very fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Love, Love, Love this!  </li>
      <li>Not as good as the original Instyler.</li>
      <li>It was a great product at first, but after about 2 years it broke.</li>
      <li>It is an awesome hot brush, the flat iron is great for beginners who want to chase their hair.</li>
      <li>I love how versatile it is.</li>
      <li>I love this.  </li>
      <li>so don&#x27;t take my word for granted :)</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>

      <li>once your start, it was able to maintain the heat to keep working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>real magic with the device is when you close it, and use it as a hot brush.</li>
      <li>and I still do it most of the time, but when I want to look polished and sophisticated (which admittedly is a lot these days)</li>
      <li>I love anything the instyler puts out there products work so well with my hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not satisfied at all.  Maybe works fine for some people, but for me it was way too much time consuming in the morning.  I normally do just fine with a round brush and blow dryer.  Definitely not what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;The worse is returning it, Instyler does not REFUND FOR NOT BEING SATISFIED.  I should have gotten this from another retailer who refunds 100% It cost me the trial cost, plus postage and I had to pay 12.00 to return it.  When asking the customer service rep will I get a refund, she said NO that&#x27;s part of the deal.&lt;br /&gt;Will never order from them again.  Products that I have ordered on TV or online ALWAYS REFUND 100% WHEN NOT SATISFIED.&lt;br /&gt;VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT.  NOT AS SHOWN ON THE ADS DEFINITELY NOT.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine straight hair and it does nothing for me.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Quick and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how every body is giving such amazing reviews on this product.&lt;br /&gt;Yea, it&#x27;s nice, it&#x27;s lightweight, easy to hold, but that&#x27;s pretty much it!&lt;br /&gt;When I tried to curl my hair with this, went by the instructions, it got tangled up something awful.&lt;br /&gt;I had to quickly unplug it so that it wouldn&#x27;t burn my hair up.&lt;br /&gt;My husband had to help me untangle this thing from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;By the time we were done getting it out, my head was throbbing.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are too large and chunky to get the hair to move easily around them.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I wasn&#x27;t doing something right, but it definitely didn&#x27;t curl as easily as their making it look.&lt;br /&gt;As a straightener, it&#x27;s a little better, (kinda hard to mess up with straightening)&lt;br /&gt;but as a curler, NO!</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron because it said cool touch but omg it was not! Yes you can touch the bristles but still you can feel the heat in it and because my fingers are small and thin I accidentally touch the barrel that was between the bristles while in curling mode ( so I&#x27;m not talking about the plate where you put your hair to straighten it ). It was really hot of course I am really disappointed about this one and will not recommend it. I can&#x27;t even have it curl my hair the way I like it because it always ended up tangled unlike the instyler wet and dry which a breeze to use.</li>
    <li> The barrel works well even on my thick spirals  However. The ceramic was chiped off when I decided to use it as a flat iron.  It does not maintain the heat consistently.</li>
    <li> It is an awesome hot brush, the flat iron is great for beginners who want to chase their hair.</li>
    <li> This iron worked really nicely on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very long, thick, and wavy.  I usually use an iron to smooth and straighten it.  This works very well for that purpose - even on my very thick hair.  The iron heats quickly and I found it very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I didn&#x27;t find the styling brush as good, though this may be strictly due to the type of hair I have.  My hair caught in it, tangling, even though I followed instructions to the letter.  There&#x27;s something extremely disconcerting about having a styling iron caught in your hair!  I was finally able to extricate my hair, but I won&#x27;t be using the brush again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, brush issues notwithstanding, this is an excellent straightener and I&#x27;ll continue to use for that function!</li>
    <li> Overall I think this would be a good investment. Just be sure to read the manual and follow the instructions or you might lose a chunk of hair. The curling feature is really best used just on the ends of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Heated up quickly, 30 seconds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straightened my thick, coarse, curly hair completely and quickly (as well as my 3 inch flat iron)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straightener, curling iron (locks to become curling iron), and curl brush all in one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compact multi tool- great for travelling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair comb/pick included&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Bag included is not a heat shield&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No automatic turn off if accidentally left on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While using the straighter the high/low/off switch slides easily (happened many times making it change the setting/turning it off)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only a high and low setting</li>
    <li> This combination curling brush and flat iron has two heat settings and takes several minutes to heat up. Single-purpose appliances do a better job but this might be a good choice for travel.</li>
    <li> I have hair that falls to the middle of my back, and is fine with a light natural curl. I don&#x27;t usually curl my hair because it is time-consuming and the curl doesn&#x27;t seem to last.&lt;br /&gt;I saw a commercial for this product, so I thought I&#x27;d try it.&lt;br /&gt;It still took quite a bit of time to curl my hair. And, of course, the curls looked nothing like on TV. I used hair spray afterwards to see if it could last longer.&lt;br /&gt;It did seem to straighten fairly well, but my hair is not particularly tough to straighten.</li>
    <li> I bought my first one and it broke, so I returned it and got a second one, and now that has broken too.  What happens is you unlock it to use as a straightener and then you go to lock it and it breaks.  I would think that as expensive as this is - that it wouldn&#x27;t be so cheaply made.  I&#x27;m going back to my Instyler that is the metal barrel heater roller!</li>
    <li> This is one of those products that seems like a great idea on paper. It&#x27;s a flat iron, and it&#x27;s also got the InStyler gizmo to curl, all in one appliance. What can go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, plenty if you have long or thick hair. The brush section of this just latches onto your locks and doesn&#x27;t let GO! I heard of one woman who had to cut her hair out of it, it was so bad. I didn&#x27;t have quite that problem, but whoa, it&#x27;s like a mousetrap for hair. It latches onto your locks and you have a devil of a time untangling it. And remember, you&#x27;re doing this all with a hot appliance, so that&#x27;s just pure fun for your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know who came up with this product, but apparently the guy with the &amp;#34;Kill&amp;#34; stamp for new projects was out sick the day this went off to the factory. Two stars, because many InStyler products ARE good. This just isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
    <li> Difficult to use and doesn&#x27;t get that hot.  Can&#x27;t compete with the first Instyler</li>
    <li> Wife review: As a flat iron, it does its job but not the greatest job. I had to go over the same strands multiple times and didn&#x27;t get the outcome I expected. While the brush or bristles on the outside of the iron may be a good idea, it didn&#x27;t work well for me. I wanted to a slight wave to curl the ends towards my face but when I turn to do that my hair did not roll through the brush smoothly and it made a bump in the middle. So instead of a straight hair with a style at the end, there&#x27;s a bump in the middle. My hair also didn&#x27;t have that smooth silky look I got from my higher end Solia flat iron.</li>
    <li> My wife tested this on her thick hair and it worked great straightening it.  It did take some time to get started after plugging it but it once your start, it was able to maintain the heat to keep working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, when she tried to get waves out of it, it did not work as well on her hair.  She does, have thick hair, as all new hairdresssers that would work on her would always mention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She did try this out on her friend with baby fine hair and it worked great in giving it body and gave some waves that they were going.  My wife did say that her hair can be difficult.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this has beem working for my wife for two weeks now without any problems and as with any hair products and appliance,  your hairtype is to be taken into consideration.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;ve had the lesson reinforced once again: my very significant other just isn&#x27;t into gadgetry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In her limited service as the designated test subject of this device, she opined that the device worked. But truth be told, her hair is essentially naturally straight and she had been to the stylist last week. As for curling, it wasn&#x27;t instant and her patience is limited. But she said the device was pretty easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Our granddaughter was delighted to sit for some testing and hair was straightened and curled to some extent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So, from the admittedly limited testing, it seems like the product is well-suited to the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerry</li>
    <li> Straightening my wavy hair is challenging. The irons don&#x27;t lay  on my hair ... Takes longer to style my hair that way.&lt;br /&gt;As for the curls, those work but&lt;br /&gt;My hair goes crazy in this summer humidity.&lt;br /&gt;My hair normally coarse,&lt;br /&gt;Looks less dry and more finished.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good. But it need to get much hotter. Requires a lot of passes to get the hair straight.</li>
    <li> A complete disappointment ---- I thought of buying the rotating InStyler which I used to have and loved it, but broke down, and thought this could be even better... It wasn&#x27;t  :&#x27;( ... curls are okayish, but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as smooth as the rotating one, not even close ... decided to keep it cause I don&#x27;t have another one... I still think this company is very good and this item might be pretty good for other type of hairs, but not for mine...so don&#x27;t take my word for granted :)</li>
    <li> This worked perfectly for my hair.  I have shoulder length hair that is fairly straight with a bit of wave. I wear my hair in a ponytail a lot and it put kinks in my hair.  So when I am ready to go somewhere, I just use the flat iron on this to straighten my hair out.  It is fairly quick.  Then, I use the curling brush part to put a slight curl on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned that the bristles would pull my hair, but they are nice heavy rubber nibs and it worked quite well!  I am very happy with this 2 in 1 product.  I don&#x27;t like curling irons because they take too long ... I do use hot rollers once in a while when I&#x27;m going out.  But when I&#x27;m just wanting my hair to be tame and straightened, I will use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I like about this product is that it has a swivel cord so that it doesn&#x27;t get kinked up when you are working with it.  All in all, a very good product, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> A little roller brush, a little flat iron, it all goes together in one package. My daughter has enjoyed using this because she can straighten and add wave (or tame her bangs) all in one. Heats up quickly and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine hair that has a little natural wave to it. It’s not enough wave that I can just let it dry naturally and go, of course. So, I have to actually style my hair every day. I have a hot brush that has been my favorite hair styling tool for a while, so when I saw the InStyler Ionic Styler Pro Ionic Hot Brush and Ceramic Flat Iron, Purple I was intrigued by it. I do sometimes use flat irons, and the thought that this one appliance can do both means it takes up less space on my vanity and in my luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat iron function works as well as any other flat iron I’ve used. I really didn’t see a major advantage of this flat iron over others, except for the multifunction feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hot brush tool, however, is the best I have ever used. It curls or waves quickly and easily and my hair holds the curl from this tool better than normally. I typical use it to curl sections in ringlets and then lightly finger comb them together with my hair upset down. The result is soft, pretty waves that last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this hair styler and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a good &amp;#34;several tools in one&amp;#34; styling tool.  My hair is too short right now to use it on, but both of my daughters love it.  One has thick, coarse hair that is a bit more of a challenge to curl, but my other daughter&#x27;s hair is ramrod straight and fine.  She is able to get some nice, relaxed waves in her hair and so far she hasn&#x27;t managed to get her hair all tangled up in the brush.  It can be locked open to be used as a flat iron, or locked closed to be used as a styling/curling brush.  the swivel cord is so nice because that keeps the cord from twisting and getting all kinked up.  And there is enough length to the cord to give you some distance from the outlet and still work easily on the hair on the back of your head.  They both need more practice at using it but I can see how they might actually become quite proficient at using it.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty slick 4 in one iron. The iron heats up relatively quickly when selecting one of the two settings. The cord is approx 6 feet which is a good length for my bathroom and I like the fact it&#x27;s a brush plus iron giving you multiple uses. Overall really happy with how this performs, the build quality is good and it heats up fast. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 this one and a $20 one. Sent this one back. The other one was as good if not better and better price</li>
    <li> This is a powerfully versatile styler. My niece has been experimenting with various ionic stylers with spectacular results. They function efficiently, have an ergonomically comfortable design, and heat quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This combination curler and flat iron makes a greatly convenient way to accomplish complex looks in a short amount of time.</li>
    <li> This seems to be a very high quality hot brush and flat iron combo tool. The styler works wonderfully, and the the brush is perfect for my length of hair. They really didn&#x27;t skimp in the design of this styling tool, from the comfort of the handle, to the controlled heat settings, to the generous length of electric cord that swivels at the base of the iron. It is nice to have such a well thought out product where they paid attention to all the little details.</li>
    <li> This is the best of what I have found and what I have used so far. Easy to use for me since I have no styling expertise at all. I like the brush bristles which gives me ease in rolling my hair to give volume. My hairs short and very fine. End results gives good volume and nice soft style.&lt;br /&gt;I really like it.</li>
    <li> I love this tool! It adds shine and makes my hair look and feel just lovely.. One thing though: I&#x27;ll never understand why it&#x27;s considered a curling tool. I&#x27;ve straightened and waved my hair but every time I attempt the bouncing curls the ad boasts about I end up nearly ripping my hair out. It is perfect as far as waving and straightening goes so I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Heatsnfast.  Very effective on my straight fine hair.</li>
    <li> Really works great as a flat iron. Both my daughter and I use it. However, I wasn&#x27;t as impressed with its performance as a curling iron.</li>
    <li> This InStyler Ionic Styler Hot Brush is a nice flat iron that heats up quickly. The bristles on the outside are nice for curling the ends of your hair, it easily straightens, and my hair comes out looking nice. Sadly it still takes about as long as my Chi (about an hour for all my hair) so it&#x27;s not any quicker than what I was using, but it still works as intended.</li>
    <li> So in love. Makes doing my hair a breeze. Can straighten without even opening if needed. Adds tons of body to crown and amazing curls.</li>
    <li> Nicely made and easy to use - great for straightening.  I haven&#x27;t used the curling feature myself but my daughter says it works well.  Easy to use and does a good job!</li>
    <li> When I was younger, you could always tell when one of your girlfriends had a curling iron accident by the burn on her face.  the nice thing about this is that you can put it close to your scalp or your face and not burn yourself because the plastic bristles give you some protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fairly klutzy with hair styling so I can&#x27;t do the fancier curls (not would my hair hold them even if I could manage it).  But the flat iron gives it a nice straight look and I can get a little bend at the ends by using the hot brush part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I find the [[ASIN:B00KOJ8V5I InStyler Wet To Dry Rotating Iron, Purple, 1-1/4 Inch]] for regular use.</li>
    <li> So does not work on fine hair.</li>
    <li> A little bulky to handle, but overall does a decent job of both curling and straightening.</li>
    <li> Fresh out of the shower, I let my naturally curly hair air dry!  My hair is thick, long, and has fun curls!  It&#x27;s medium-curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Brush never got tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium-curly hair, naturally.  I let it air dry after washing &amp; conditioning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Heats up quickly.  It took about 3 minutes to heat up.&lt;br /&gt;- Brush does not get tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- After 3 passes, my hair was still not straight.  It was a very wavy, VERY FRIZZY mess.&lt;br /&gt;- Iron never feels like it&#x27;s tightly holding your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is better for someone with wavy hair.  Not medium or heavy curls.</li>
    <li> The Ioinic styler is much like other heated applinces I have tried.  The one advantage it offers is that it is a heated brush (round on one side) as well as a flat iron.  The stytling is accomplished by heat.  Heat causes damage. It does not bring lifeless hair back to life or make it healthier or shinier.  The one thing it does do in terms of improving appearance is dry it.  if it is frizzy or unruly because of humidity, the drying can help short term, but will produce damage which will make it look and feel worse long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually had something of a problem using this.  My hair got tangled and was difficult to unwrap from the brush.  I turned it off o prevent my hair getting burned and unplugged it so that I could more easily manipulate it to free myself.  i actually wound up losing some hair :(  I would have rated it 2 stars, but because it is a relatively compact unit which can be used to curl or straighten, I put it back.  I do not find this appliance to be much better than a little plastic curling wand I had as a child.  This is not a toy.  I is more substantial and better built, but also heavier (in case one were thinking about using it when traveling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and intuitive; a very simple appliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will straighten or curl your hair, but again, it is the heat which is setting it.  Heat damages hair.  If this damages it less than other appliances it is because here is a ow heat setting.  There are no magic sub-atomic particles repairing your hair, making it healthier or shinier, maybe more manageable , if it is counteracting the effects of humidity.&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how they get away with making these claims,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a flat iron which doubles s a heated rush, one which can dry your hair a little faster (with the heated brush), add some curl or straighten, this is as good as any I have used, but really, not much better.</li>
    <li> This is the third InStyler Iron that I&#x27;ve tried and it was actually the least effective on my naturally curly hair.  With this one I found that without a rotating brush it got tangled in my hair easily. I tested this iron on both dry and damp hair and I got the best results with dry hair, although not as good as the rotating brush irons.  To straighten my entire head, it took over 45 minutes and the results were still less than I would have liked. Overall I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll continue to use this iron, when I have better performing ones. As a note I did have my daughter try it out on her straight shoulder length hair and she got great results so it&#x27;s probably best suited for that hair type.</li>
    <li> I love anything the instyler puts out there products work so well with my hair I definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I was a little worried I wouldn&#x27;t be able to adjust to this brush/curling/flat iron but wow!! I love it! The end has a cool touch so no more burning my fingers &amp; the flat iron works just as well as the one I had. The only thing that&#x27;s taking a bit of adjusting is the curling iron part. But I&#x27;ve used it twice now and both times was very happy with the result. I have fine, fine, thin gray blonde hair &amp; the low temperature is perfect for me. It was packed well &amp; arrived quickly. I plan on ordering a 2nd one soon for travel &amp; back up. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Bigger than expected, not good on thin hair get hot like others</li>
    <li> I was worried about buying this new iron since there were no reviews yet, but I&#x27;m glad I did. This iron was bought to replace my worn-out rotating hot iron, also from InStyler, so I do trust the brand name. I think the hot brush works better than my attempts to use the blow dryer and round brush myself, so if you&#x27;re flying solo with that impossible task I&#x27;d definitely recommend. The flat iron itself is the best I&#x27;ve personally ever used. Because this iron has those bristles you can REALLY get to the root of your hair, which was a problem for me before since I have naturally curly and frizzy hair. No more wavy roots yay! Also the actual lines of bristles themselves move a little bit on the barrel so it doesn&#x27;t get tangled up. I really like that you can grab and guide the tool without burning yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say much on how well it curls hair, since I did not buy it for that purpose, but the one time I got curious and tried it didn&#x27;t go so well. Even with using the method to curl like the instructions say, my (then straight) hair got horribly tangled in the bristles. 10 minutes, one yell, one minor burn, and a clump of mangled hair later, it finally let me go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, as a hot brush AND a straighter I say it&#x27;s 5 star worthy! Curling you&#x27;d have to ask a more qualified person. Definitely a product I&#x27;ll be taking care of for a while!</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, &amp;#60;3  this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, thin, and unruly hair. And like most women with thin hair, I’m always looking for the next product that promises volume.  Look no further!!! Before I would use a curling iron to give me the volume I wanted, but this would always damage my hair, I couldn’t even straighten my hair because of the damage on my ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with the Instyler Ionic Styler Pro, I have volume and the ability to straighten my hair without the damage to my ends. I am a working mother and as you may or may not know, mornings can be chaotic. My morning routine would consist of at least 20-30 minutes on my hair alone! Ugh!  Now, with the Instyler Ionic Styler Pro, I let my hair air dry as I am getting the kids ready for the day and only need 10 mins to style my hair!! 10 minutes people!!  This product has allowed me to alleviate the stress of my morning routine and have fabulous looking hair that lasts all day long with no damage! I can’t stop telling everyone how great this product is. Go out and get one, NOW!</li>
    <li> I love it! I&#x27;m not the most talented at styling my hair, but the Ionic Styler Pro makes it easy. I love how versatile it is. It&#x27;s great for mornings when I don&#x27;t have a lot of time – I will just use the heated brush to comb through my hair a few times and my hair looks much healthier and smoother. It quickly smoothes out my frizz with very little effort. On days when I have more time I will use the flat iron to get a more sleek look, or use the brush to give some more volume and waves. It&#x27;s great for traveling, very light and replaces a lot of other hair tools.</li>
    <li> very nice for a two in one product</li>
    <li> OMG!!  I LOVE this tool!!  It does everything I need and it does it well.  I can make soft curls, tight curls, beachy waves.  I can even straighten my hair with it. I do my moms hair with it all the time.  It&#x27;s fast and easy.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!</li>
    <li> Love it. Need to purchase another one for travel bag. Replaced curling iron and flat iron. Best thing is I have not burned myself with this.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this!  It&#x27;s easy to use and does not burn my hair!  Best curler ever for my bob!</li>
    <li> I recently cut all my hair off and need to smooth and straighten it a little.  This new InStyler is perfect.  I love the hot round brush idea and the built in flat iron is a great added bonus.  It&#x27;s a little pricey but worth the cost I think.  The quality of the tool is quite good.  I found it heated up quickly and was very easy to use.  I&#x27;ve had various hot air round brush tools in the past and this surpasses them by far.  The cool touch bristles and tip make is easy to use and keep you from scorching your fingers!  I brought it into work so a friend could try it and she loves it too.  Perfect if you&#x27;re like me with wavy and curly hair that needs smoothing and straightening without loosing the volume.</li>
    <li> I love this! it works great on my hair especially since my hair has gotten very kinky the older I get...love the fact that I can use it as a brush and a flat iron...Best gadget I have in my bathroom! Use it everyday and would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> Tangles easily with african hair. More of a pain than help</li>
    <li> Button to keep it locked is not that great at all... it gets unlocked all the time.</li>
    <li> As a flat iron it’s pretty standard for an ionized, it does the trick, smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;The real magic with the device is when you close it, and use it as a hot brush. You can touch it anywhere, it won’t burn you; the bristles don’t get even a little hot. Do be careful, though, not to put your fingertips between the bristles when tucking in an end, turn the device until it pulls it in instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a curling iron it’s also pretty great, but a bit awkward, the technique is hard to learn and once mastered still a bit difficult to execute. Does make very nice curls that are also very smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again I wish I could do half stars, and three is a bit cheap for this device, but four is a bit too generous. I tipped to the generous side this time because I do like the device.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have shoulder-length hair that is layered.  I use the straightener and the hot brush every time I style my hair. LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
    <li> Love it!  Better than switching from a straightener to a curling iron.</li>
    <li> No matter how many times I tried, I couldn’t do waves or curls with the Hot Brush part of this unit. My hair got caught in the bristles every single time, cuing lots of cursing and frustration as I tried to untangle. The one plus is that I didn’t feel any heat coming off the bristles, as advertised, so at least I didn’t burn myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t usually style my hair, but I’ll try gimmicky products in the hopes that I’ll be able to do something… and then I remember why they’re gimmicky products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you’re like me, and not the best at doing things to your hair, this might be a product to pass up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat iron part did work okay for me. I have mostly straight, thick hair. But the brush parts made it hard to get close to the scalp, and even when I was just using the flat iron function, the brush parts would pick up loose hair and make a mess. I’ve never had that happen with a normal flat iron.</li>
    <li> Did not meet expectations from commercial. Very dissatisfied!</li>
    <li> I bought this product six months ago and really like it, but.........  In the past couple of months bristles have started falling out and there is now a significant area with no bristles at all.  As a result, I have gotten several nasty burns!  Based on the fact that I have not seen another customer review noting this problem, I am going to reorder.  Fingers crossed I get a good one this time!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loved it.😄</li>
    <li> I bought this tool because I was tired of using cheap tools.  So the straightener part was good but the bristles kept getting tangled in my hair.  I tried it several times and even had my hairdresser freind use it on me to see if it was me.  She has the same result.  I finally gave mine away and bought a chi straighter and I&#x27;m much more pleased.  It curls better  and straightens great too.  Should&#x27;ve bought the chi first off.</li>
    <li> it gets tangle even in short hair...</li>
    <li> I have been using straighteners for as long as I can remember! The expensive ones too! I recently wanted a little curl to the ends of my hair and was recommended this product by my mom, she raves about it! And now I do too! I havent used any of my expensive straighteners since ive purchased this! it is absolutely wonderful!!! It looks like my hair was professionally done every time i use it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to try this product!!!</li>
    <li> I had another ceramic brush styler...which was horrid..this is much lighter in weight...heats very quickly and is very easy to use...I love the cord on it..it&#x27;s not too thick so it doesn&#x27;t get in the way when using the styler...so practical to have both the brush AND flat iron in one</li>
    <li> I have thick, rather coarse hair.  I could not get it to work as advertised on my hair.  I think I probably needed it to get a little hotter.</li>
    <li> 12 year old granddaughter loves  it uses it everyday.</li>
    <li> Even though this product is listed as &#x27;instant heat&#x27; it still takes about 3-4 minutes to get to the desired heat point. While you&#x27;re waiting through that stretch you can pass the time by doing a thorough brushing of your hair and the ionic bristles feel great and works effectively through thick strands. The nice thing with this product is it&#x27;s dual functionality as a hot brush and flat iron. While neither feature is a standout on their own the performance is decent and provides adequate compromise if say, you were packing for a weekend trip and decided to take only this along versus 2-3 other devices.</li>
    <li> Now this is great! I younger need two devices!</li>
    <li> I have used this at medium temp for only 5 months and Teflon coating is falling off! And now it&#x27;s too late to return! Not a happy camper!</li>
    <li> Love this N Styler I&#x27;m going to get another I love doing my hair now u can do so much with it</li>
    <li> Looks nice, its purple and cost $69 plus 25% off at Rite Aid. They have a return if not 100% satisfied policy.  it did not come with a case. it has a nice long cord. its not heavy.  I like the concept of having a 2-in-1 tool...and would have given 5 stars if it saved me any time...it took longer but i could toll be getting used to it. Like others have stated, annoying switches...I constantly turn the thing off while I&#x27;m using it and wonder why it doesn&#x27;t seem to work...then realize its off and cooled down. Found that, although it can do 2 (not 4) different things pretty well, it didn&#x27;t save me time because it doesn&#x27;t straighten as quickly as my One Pass straightener. I do like the way I can get a slight curl under for my ends and bangs, without getting too much of a curl like with curling iron. However, I can tell, this is not the kind of curl that is going to last when there is even a little humidity - right now there&#x27;s none.  All in all it&#x27;s not as wonderful as I had hoped. If I try to curl my hair slips out so I can only get the ends done. Brushing hair with this Instyler didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. I&#x27;m not noticing any increase in shine either. I think it&#x27;s just going to replace the curling iron for everyday use...but not for good, in case I want real curls for an occasion.</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s all in what you&#x27;re expecting. I have tried several of these &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; (or maybe just high-priced) hair tools in the past few months. This one is actually a keeper. A styling brush isn&#x27;t meant to do the same work as a styling iron. It doesn&#x27;t produce tight curls, but soft curves and waves. And it does that very well, at least in my opinion.  I plugged it in to heat, set it on low and took a 6 minute shower. My hair was dry, but I had serious bed-head. My natural hair time is slightly coarse with a natural wave. So it&#x27;s not entirely cooperative about being told which direction to go. And I&#x27;ve never used a flat iron that could make it truly striaght. Well, this one did both for me. I literally flat ironed my entire head of shoulder-length hair in just about 5 minutes. Then I used the brush to gently curl the ends inward. What I loved about it is that I didn&#x27;t have to be careful to keep the tip of the iron from touching my skin. It stays completely cool. And the edgesof the flat iron/brush are also comfortable at the edge. No chance of burning your skin when the iron edges come in contact. That&#x27;s a really big plus when you have 3 young girls at home who like to have their hair done. It gave me a nice, gentle straightening with one full pass on low heat. It would stand to reason that on high heat it would be a bit smoother. I used no products, gels or sprays, either. That would only enhance the results. Overall, this is definitely a keeper. Child-friendly and didn&#x27;t scorch my hair or skin in the process of straightening.</li>
    <li> Doesnt curl my hait properly.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair tool many many years ago. It was a great product at first, but after about 2 years it broke. The barrel...unrolled itself? If that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;In those 2 years I owned it I loved it. It straightened my hair very well, I have normal to thick hair, fairly smooth not course. I could not get this thing to curl my hair though. Mind you my hair is pin straight naturally and I have a hard time curling it period. But this I couldn&#x27;t even get a decent curl.&lt;br /&gt;It did make my hair nice and shiny and beautiful, I just wish it lasted longer than 2 years.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing tool!  After reading the reviews I was worried about tangling while using the brush styling part, but it couldn&#x27;t be easier.  It gave me really nice curls that look way more natural than a curling iron.  I also liked the straightener to give me a sleek look.  You can tell it&#x27;s ionic, it gave my hair a really sleek sheen all over.  Great product for me, might not work for hair that is super thick or tangles easily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not real happy with it. It doesn&#x27;t do a very good job at all</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair &amp; the Styler smooths out the frizz nicely, I give it a thumbs up</li>
    <li> I was excited about the dual function of this hot brush and flat iron. It comes with three settings (off, low, and high) and with another switch you can unlock it to flat iron mode or lock it to hot brush mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After testing it, I have to say I was disappointed in its performance. I was able to get the flat iron function to work without much problem. I did not have much luck with the hot brush function though... I just kept on getting it stuck in my hair or did not notice much of an effect.</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised by this product. I have straight hair and used my straightener to smooth my hair and add volume and this does both well.  It took a little getting used to, but I really do like this product. I was more successful with this than I am with a blow dryer and round rush. However, I prefer the InStyler rolling iron. I do think this would be a great product to pack in a carry-on for a short trip.</li>
    <li> This actually worked for my thick curly hair, whereas most devices would fail. I am not a frequent user of a styling tool of any kind mostly because my hair is so thick that it will kill the device / not yield any results. This was actually fun to experiment with- the instructions ere pretty self-explanatory.</li>
    <li> I have thick, naturally wavy hair that would not normally be described as hard to work with.  I liked that this product heated up in just a few minutes.  The instructions ask that you start out by just brushing your hair with the tool to get out tangles.  When I do that and then use the brush to curl my ends under, I get a very pretty look that was easy (even for a relative hair-tools novice) and looks similar to a blow-out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The outside did remain cool to the touch, so I did not have to worry about burning myself.  However, the slide button that keeps the tool closed (or open) for use did seem to slide a bit while I was using it, so I am cautious about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions guide (and accompanying pictures) explains how to do various types of curls and overall how to use the tool, and this seemed rather straightforward to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the question has been asked, I will add that the instruction guide does say to NOT use this product with an adapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord was long enough for me, and I never felt that I was having pull-back.  The Styler comes with a comb with a few ends (which the instructions say are for helping you untangle your hair if you do have any issues).  You also get a basic black drawstring carrying pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a product you already like (particularly a standard curling iron), you probably are better off buying what you already like.  However, if you want to just use something brief to add volume or flips / curl-unders, then consider this.</li>
    <li> My wife says that It doesn&#x27;t head evenly, we had to buy another one and this one is just sitting there</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m frustrated and can&#x27;t get it to curl like the commercial.</li>
    <li> I love this.  It heats up quickly.  I use it almost daily because it is so easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love my New Ionic. Always have salon smooth hair look!</li>
    <li> BUY ONE!!!! IT IS FABULOUS!!!! Best curling iron I have ever owned. I grew up in the 80&#x27; s and have own a lot of curling irons. The instyler is by far the best one!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves them got this for her 13th bd</li>
    <li> This hair tool is amazing! I have medium length hair that is a fun combination of fine and frizzy. My typical hair styling routine has been to blow dry my hair with a round brush and then flat iron my hair (starting a couple inches down from the roots to keep some volume), which takes a minimum of 30 minutes. With this tool, I can do a quick blow dry with a flat brush and then use this tool -- I can be done in less than 10 minutes! I do a quick smooth out with the hot brush (closed) and then open it to flat iron the ends. If I have a few more minutes or want to change it up before heading out for dinner, then I curl a few sections throughout and get a loose waves look. It took me a a few times to get the curling technique down (do not curl your hair horizontally, it will get stuck and that is a frustrating situation!) -- after rereading the instructions and watching a video, I figured it out. I hold the tool vertically and then wrap a section around once (I start at about 2\\&quot; from my scalp), then I can just twist down and I get a loose curl / beachy wave - love it! I can One of the best parts of this tool is that now when I travel, I can just bring this one tool and I have lots of styling options - smooth with volume, flat ironed smooth or curls! This tool is not the most advanced flat iron or ideal curling tool, but the multi-use and overall good results that I can get quickly with no hassle, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> This is my second instyler. The first one had a moment where it stopped working but it worked fine after that. It really grew on me after I learned how to use it. And I would even say it became the best styling tool I have ever had. New users should follow instructions for usage so they won&#x27;t tangle their hair. So this item has a new feature. It can also be used to straighten your hair. A lock is available if you want to use it as a curling wand. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> My wife and 9 year old daughter uses this and they love it.  My daughter doesn&#x27;t use the flat iron option so she doesn&#x27;t have to worry about burning herself.</li>
    <li> I purchased two and one for my niece, who lives in Vegas. I told her I was bringing her another InStyler toy when I went to Vegas this past week . As usual she had not heard about the brush.  She was the first to use her brush.  She is professional Stylist and went on to rave about it and showed me pictures of the first customer she used it on.  She gives it a five plus. I think it is going to outrank her other two InStyler rotating barrel irons. I will use my brush later on this month.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot and pack light, so I love anything that pulls double duty. but I think I&#x27;m going to return this and wait for a version with a larger barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s too thin do do a good curled-under bob (the curl is too tight so I wind up with something resembling &amp;#34;the rachel&amp;#34;), but it&#x27;s too fat to do waves. as for straightening: one reviewer said she could clamp and slightly turn the iron so that it brushes while straightening, but when I do this, it grabs my hair too firmly and pulls on it. my hair is silky and above the shoulder, so that should not be a problem.</li>
    <li> I have bought many devices to control the &#x27;frizzies&#x27; and this styler is the best !  I only use the hot brush part of the tool.  My hair never tangles and it keeps my smooth even in the hot Florida humidity.  I would definitely recommend this hair tool.</li>
    <li> I like this one better than my original instyler just because there&#x27;s less chances of burning myself</li>
    <li> Not as good as the original Instyler.</li>
    <li> I am amazed with the ease of handling and working with my very fine hair.  This model of the Instyler is easy for me to use&lt;br /&gt;and produces quick and very attractive results.  I give it 5 stars</li>
    <li> The InStyler Ionic Styler Brush is the best beauty tool purchase I&#x27;ve made in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched many demonstrations, full of envy, as the models in the Perfecter demos used their styling tools with such ease, free from the fear of burning either their scalp or hair.  I knew , from experience with the Calista Tools Hot Paddle Brush, that the Perfecter just wouldn&#x27;t work for me.  My thick, coarse hair requires HEAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I did what I always do, after a search of online reviews of 2015 best beauty tools, I turned to Amazon.com.  There isn&#x27;t much hype in the ad for the InStyler, but from the photos I surmised that this one might be what I needed.  The teeth are long enough and broad enough to protect the hands and scalp from high temperatures and spaced widely enough to detangle, to guide the hair through them without breakage.  The handle is ergonomically designed for ease and safety of use.  The higher heat setting is exactly what I need !  And- at the amazingly affordable price I could afford to take a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I had this wonderful styling tool in hand I was elated, oh so glad I took the plunge.  This is everything I need.  I can flat iron from the root , ending with a twist around the barrel at the ends to accomplish two tasks at once !  I can use the locking feature to effortlessly curl whatever didn&#x27;t get curled with the first pass through, even at the nape of the neck, even at the crown.  The higher temperature allows a once-through finish, without burning , without having to hold the styler in place for extended periods of time (as is required with the Perfecter even by those who aren&#x27;t challenged with thick, curly locks) .  This styler is phenomenal !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The InStyler Ionic Hot Brush may not receive the press that the competitors receive but it should. The ratings should be higher.  I&#x27;ll admit I made this purchase as a &amp;#34;why not&amp;#34;, an alternative to the more highly rated, better advertised BaBylissPro.  But the BaByllissPro has bars of thinner, more breakage-prone, hard teeth that slip back and forth along the barrel, clacking with a tinny noise while in use. The InStyler, in contrast, has stationary broad, smooth cool touch ionic bristles.  They don&#x27;t shift, tug or pull.  They don&#x27;t make you feel like you settled for less, again .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The InStyler has heft without being heavy, a reassuring, more substantial construction.  The sliding bar on the stem locks the barrels together into a stable curling brush, securely apposing the surfaces of the flat iron.  BaBylissPro has a fragile flip top hinge at the end of the wand, which I doubt will last through many uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There aren&#x27;t many choices for a woman with the grade of hair the industry considers as an afterthought.  Until now, the traditional, dangerous, curling &amp;#34;wands&amp;#34; were the only effective tools out there. We had curling irons in the fire, literally, then scary electric branding irons.  What a find this tool is.  The fear, the dread is gone ! I can straighten, wave, curl with confidence, with ease,  and get fabulous, smooth, lustrous hair.  (keeping all my hair on my head instead of lamenting the dozens of broken strands I usually have to pull off of brush/comb/curler )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies blessed with lots of dense, coiled hair, don&#x27;t hesitate !  Don&#x27;t overthink this one.  So, all the others have disappointed you ?  I am convinced that you&#x27;ll never regret buying this versatile, effective, safe, state of the art  CERAMIC flat iron/ curling iron with IONIC bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps:  it&#x27;s on sale today, a further reduction by Amazon.com !  I bought a backup !</li>
    <li> BAD, IRON .IM  RETUR .NO GOOD.</li>
    <li> It work and make my hair lots of curls</li>
    <li> Another great InStyler product! This one works great as a flat iron, for me. I really haven&#x27;t used it for the brush, but it is a great product overall.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this beautiful contraption.  I have the most unruly, dry, frizzy, curly layered mess that anyone can imagine.  It takes the ladies at the Dry Bar 45 minutes to an hour to do my hair.  So, a long time ago, I decided to just use a ton of product and wear my hair curly, which is fine and I still do it most of the time, but when I want to look polished and sophisticated (which admittedly is a lot these days) I wash my hair and either let it air dry while I&#x27;m doing other things or hit it with a dryer for a bit, then it takes me about 15 minutes to make my hair shiny and filled with body.  I don&#x27;t use the straightener much because I like big, smooth curls, but it&#x27;s nice to have. I&#x27;ve tried everything, rollers with a bonnet dryer, curling irons, straighteners, you name it, but nothing has been as easy as this.  And the style lasts for days.  I have shoulder length, layered hair.  I&#x27;ve never been able to style my hair so quickly and easily.  Love it.</li>
    <li> have to figure out how to use!</li>
