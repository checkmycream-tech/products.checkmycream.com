    <li> I am of the male gender and I have been using this soap for years. it makes me smell fresh and clean all day. I do not why they say its for women does not say it the package.</li>

    <li> I ORDERED SAME PRODUCT FROM TWO SELLERS, ONE OF THEM ( THIS ONE) THIS SOAP IS MADE IN MEXICO, I AM NOT SURE IF HENO DE PRAVIA HAS THIS PRODUCT MANUFACTURED IN MEXICO.  I COMPARED SOAP MADE IN SPAIN AND SOAP MADE IN MEXICO, YOU CAN FEEL DIFFERENCES IN QUALITY.</li>
    <li> I found out about this soap from my sister. I love the smell. I&#x27;d call it uni-sex soap. Amazon offers a good soap for a good price. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> This soap smells great! Leaves you feeling very clean, lasts a lot longer than your average store-bought soap, and I&#x27;d even swear that it leaves almost zero soap scum on my tub or my skin!

    <li> They write in the description that the soaps  made in Spain -  got it and it&#x27;s not ! made in Mexico !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this soap in Lima, Peru every time I went there to visit my family, until I discovered that Amazon was selling it! Since I bought the cologne, it made sense to buy the soap, too . . . I love this scent!  It&#x27;s similar to Jean Nate, but the fragance of Heno De Pravia is way better!</li>
    <li> please change my name to Gladsusie as this soap is just wonderful.  I found in years ago when I lived in FL at the local CVS store.  Once it gained popularity, tho, it was very difficult to find.  Thanks for making my day with this exceptional product!</li>
    <li> We discovered this soap while traveling in Spain. We love the fragrance and texture, and were delighted to discover that it is available on amazon.</li>
