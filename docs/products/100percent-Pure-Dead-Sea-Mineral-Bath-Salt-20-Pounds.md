      <li>Fabulous product two cups with every bath or more</li>
      <li>I love this product and the price is worth the amount!</li>
      <li>so it dissolves rather easily.  </li>
      <li>Great for those soar muscles and to use along with essential oils.</li>
      <li>You already know how awesome Dead Sea Salt is since you&#x27;re shopping for it.  </li>
      <li>it is good for a hot bath thanks</li>
      <li>If you soak at least 3 times a week, this size is perfect.</li>
      <li>I will order from a more reputable company, like Salt Works or San Fransisco bath Salt Company in the future.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>This amount of salt is a great value and cost per pound was one-fourth what I previously paid for a 4 pound container.  </li>
      <li>Makes our skin soft and is safe for the grandkids.</li>
      <li>Therefore, they absorbed whatever it is through their skin....</li>
      <li>I like to soak in the tub with the sea salts as it helps my skin feel rejuvenated and fresh.</li>
      <li>That alone makes it worth the price.</li>
      <li>This company offers free shipping and you&#x27;ll get your salt within 2-3 days after it&#x27;s been shipped out...for free, for real.  </li>
      <li>as usual I am happy with my amazon purchase.</li>
      <li>If you have any questions you can call them or email, however try calling first since someone always answers (during business hours) and the people are very polite and friendly.  </li>

      <li>We use this in our hot tub.</li>
      <li>The salts are a good size for dissolving and big enough for the customer to recognize quality.</li>
      <li>What are they REALLY selling?</li>
      <li>Now, I can reasonably assume based on all the reviews (which I think are BS)</li>
      <li>My face is softer and free of white heads!</li>
      <li>I can really notice the difference in my skin, it is softer and does not itch as much.  </li>
      <li>this salt even real?</li>
      <li>Midwest offers sales on top of their already good prices, commonly 20-30% off your total if you&#x27;re ordering bulk.  </li>
      <li>I am even not that impressed by the \\&quot;Pure Dead Sea\\&quot; mud I ordered, it is jelly like and not hard-mud, thick like; so either they are putting additional things like oils in it, or it is not real dead mud</li>
      <li>They are expensive when purchased through Whole Foods or other specialty markets, and I am so happy to find an online venue that ships 20 pounds quickly.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy relaxing in a hot mineral bath without scented products -- just natural, dead sea minerals.  </li>
      <li>Therefore, if this BS FAKE SALT their selling is harmful or hazardous to the body, then it raises many other issues.</li>
      <li>You can usually see for yourself if your salt has been \\&quot;cleaned\\&quot; because it will appear white, the good salt is naturally a dingy grayish white hue.  </li>
      <li>Hey, it&#x27;s a natural product mined from an ancient sea not a chemistry lab ingredient.</li>
      <li>I WOULD STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS DISHONORABLE, DECEPTIVE, AND MISLEADING COMPANY.</li>
      <li>The USPS box got mangled during shipping but the salt bag was completely intact.</li>
      <li>Product was shipped in a very durable bag that is similar to the bags used for rice at the wholesale clubs.  </li>
      <li>very cleansing on the face- when washing your face with your choice cleanser, add some of the salts to hand or cloth and proceed as a facial scrub.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While other folks on here may happy with their orders, I find I am not based on my knowledge and previous experience with Dead Sea products.</li>
      <li>, I will not use these salts again obviously and will stick with Dead Sea Spa Magik, good clean pure Dead Sea Salts from the Dead Sea not from a contaminated swamp!!!</li>
      <li>A quick swipe with a sponge removes the small amount of residue.</li>
      <li>As an unexpected benefit it seems to have cured her winter dry skin.</li>
      <li>They claim to be selling 100% Pure Dead Sea Mineral Bath Salt.</li>

<li> As an unexpected benefit it seems to have cured her winter dry skin.</li>
<li> They claim to be selling 100% Pure Dead Sea Mineral Bath Salt.</li>
<li> Or it could be very, very, low quality Dead Sea salts with lots of other salt mixed in, but I highly doubt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> For comparison, Saltworks sells \\&quot;Bokek\\&quot; Dead Sea Salt in 20 lb bags for 44.99 before taxes...and it is absolutely the same as what Midwest sells for 10 bucks less.  </li>
<li> This company is highly questionable now to me, with its claims on 100% real Dead Sea Salt and Mud, and I challenge them to produce a REAL certificate of authenticity stamped and signed, with importation clearance, saying the stuff they sell is 100% real!</li>
<li> /&gt;This is NOT REAL SALT.</li>
<li> The salt I got is almost like powder and has no big grains in it, which is what I like about dead sea salt.</li>
<li> THIS IS NOT REAL SALT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Another reviewer downgraded a similar product by this company for having other \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; in with the salts (probably a few particles of sand).</li>
<li> Other reviewers seemed to have picked up on this intuitively, follow your instincts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I thought it was going to come in a tub or zip bag like other purveyors of Dead Sea salt use, and the bag was not even closed when I opened the USPS</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not happy after inspecting this product, since the grains of salt DO NOT look anything like previous dead sea salt I have used, and the grains are not coarse at all.</li>
<li> I know the smell of dead sea salt and the look of it</li>
<li> I ordered this product expecting 100% REAL DEAD SEA SALT from the DEAD SEA.</li>
<li> What a WASTE OF TIME, ENERGY, AND MONEY!</li>
<li> I thought I would try this salt as I was unable to get hold of my usual Dead Sea Spa Magik Salts which I have been using for about 15</li>
<li> Companies that play childish games like this should be EXPOSED, and Lose their corrupt corporation.</li>
<li> the benefit of the doubt, only to be utterly disappointed in the end.</li>
<li> do I know if it is real dead salt or just some random salt from California or wherever?\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
<li> though I would try them in my bath anyway and to my disgust they made the water dirty and greasy with an awful smell, I dipped my elbow in and it actually hurt my psoriasis and left it stinging</li>
<li> /&gt;Furthermore, it is FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!</li>
<li> It is highly disappointing and maddening.</li>
<li> Hi, I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed so go ahead and order this.  </li>
<li> salts arrived and to my shock they smelt really horrible and looked dirty,</li>
<li> I am very mad</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This review is to point out my experience with buying this product, and follows on J Order&#x27;s points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the same Midwest Bath Salt Company 20lbs. bagged dead sea salt, and I specified on my order that I wanted coarse grain salt, which is at most 4mm in size and at least 0.5-1mm in size. The salt I got is almost like powder and has no big grains in it, which is what I like about dead sea salt. It is highly disappointing and maddening. I thought it was going to come in a tub or zip bag like other purveyors of Dead Sea salt use, and the bag was not even closed when I opened the USPS box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not happy after inspecting this product, since the grains of salt DO NOT look anything like previous dead sea salt I have used, and the grains are not coarse at all. I know the smell of dead sea salt and the look of it and I believe that this product is NOT IT! Or it could be very, very, low quality Dead Sea salts with lots of other salt mixed in, but I highly doubt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot find a certificate of authenticity on their web site and the salt does not come with one, as I thought it would since most companies do that because of rampant low quality and fake salts out there, and they have not responded back to my e-mail questions about my order. I am even not that impressed by the \\&quot;Pure Dead Sea\\&quot; mud I ordered, it is jelly like and not hard-mud, thick like; so either they are putting additional things like oils in it, or it is not real dead mud either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While other folks on here may happy with their orders, I find I am not based on my knowledge and previous experience with Dead Sea products. I am very mad I will probably have to pay for return shipping to get my refund (if I ever do, my total order was over $60) and do not plan on EVER ordering from Midwest Bath Salt Company again. This company is highly questionable now to me, with its claims on 100% real Dead Sea Salt and Mud, and I challenge them to produce a REAL certificate of authenticity stamped and signed, with importation clearance, saying the stuff they sell is 100% real! I will order from a more reputable company, like Salt Works or San Fransisco bath Salt Company in the future.</li>
    <li> Hi, I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed so go ahead and order this.  You already know how awesome Dead Sea Salt is since you&#x27;re shopping for it.  Did you know that it stops being awesome if it is refined?  Yep.  You can usually see for yourself if your salt has been \\&quot;cleaned\\&quot; because it will appear white, the good salt is naturally a dingy grayish white hue.  I just got my 20 lb bag from Midwest, it&#x27;s dingy, yay!  This company offers free shipping and you&#x27;ll get your salt within 2-3 days after it&#x27;s been shipped out...for free, for real.  If you have any questions you can call them or email, however try calling first since someone always answers (during business hours) and the people are very polite and friendly.  Midwest offers sales on top of their already good prices, commonly 20-30% off your total if you&#x27;re ordering bulk.  I got this for literally 36.99, no taxes no shipping cost.  For comparison, Saltworks sells \\&quot;Bokek\\&quot; Dead Sea Salt in 20 lb bags for 44.99 before taxes...and it is absolutely the same as what Midwest sells for 10 bucks less.  On their site you can also find bath teas, soaps, etc or just have them custom blend your salts.  I&#x27;m very happy with Midwest and will order all of my future salt from them.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my wife.  This amount of salt is a great value and cost per pound was one-fourth what I previously paid for a 4 pound container.  Twenty pounds of bath salt will more than fill a one gallon size container.  The salt crystal size is comparable to kosher salt so it dissolves rather easily.  Product was shipped in a very durable bag that is similar to the bags used for rice at the wholesale clubs.  The USPS box got mangled during shipping but the salt bag was completely intact.</li>
    <li> great company, great buy, and wonderful on the skin! I love this product and the price is worth the amount! my skin and my babies skin is softer, it has relieved her eczema and mine a bit as well! very cleansing on the face- when washing your face with your choice cleanser, add some of the salts to hand or cloth and proceed as a facial scrub. My face is softer and free of white heads! as usual I am happy with my amazon purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife as a relaxing soak. As an unexpected benefit it seems to have cured her winter dry skin. That alone makes it worth the price. Another reviewer downgraded a similar product by this company for having other \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; in with the salts (probably a few particles of sand). Hey, it&#x27;s a natural product mined from an ancient sea not a chemistry lab ingredient. A quick swipe with a sponge removes the small amount of residue. Only problem is how do I top this gift for our anniversary? Hmmm...</li>
    <li> Love these salts. They are definitely beneficial. Makes for a wonderful and relaxing healthful bath. Will be buying from them again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product expecting 100% REAL DEAD SEA SALT from the DEAD SEA. When I tested this salt with my lye solution, there was no reaction AT ALL. It has NO MINERAL CONTENT what so ever. THIS IS NOT REAL SALT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, it is FALSE ADVERTISEMENT! They claim to be selling 100% Pure Dead Sea Mineral Bath Salt. Test it and See For YOURSELF. I WOULD STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS DISHONORABLE, DECEPTIVE, AND MISLEADING COMPANY. Other reviewers seemed to have picked up on this intuitively, follow your instincts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT REAL SALT. What are they REALLY selling? Now, I can reasonably assume based on all the reviews (which I think are BS) people have posted, that many people have used this FAKE product to bathe with. Therefore, they absorbed whatever it is through their skin.... an organ WITH NO FILTER SYSTEM i.e liver, kidneys, etc. Therefore, if this BS FAKE SALT their selling is harmful or hazardous to the body, then it raises many other issues. I WOULD NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY. NO EXCEPTIONS, I them the benefit of the doubt, only to be utterly disappointed in the end. What a WASTE OF TIME, ENERGY, AND MONEY! Companies that play childish games like this should be EXPOSED, and Lose their corrupt corporation.</li>
    <li> It cleared up my wife&#x27;s skin condition where doctor medicines did not,her skin looks great and feels softer. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Very nice product.  Great for those soar muscles and to use along with essential oils. I would buy this again</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis and have been using this in my bathwater.  I can really notice the difference in my skin, it is softer and does not itch as much.  I will definitly buy again!</li>
    <li> Fabulous product two cups with every bath or more your skin and complexion will improve you will look younger and feel relaxed</li>
    <li> If you have never tried soaking in Dead Sea salt, try it as it is very relaxing. Terrific price for this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this and it came with a big white sag. No product seal, certificate or anything.&lt;br /&gt;It got me thinking \\&quot;How do I know if it is real dead salt or just some random salt from California or wherever?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Is this salt even real?</li>
    <li> my wife likes this stuff a lot i will buy it again it is good for a hot bath thanks</li>
    <li> These bath salts are excellent for detoxing and adding lavendar oil drop, a nice way to relax. If you soak at least 3 times a week, this size is perfect. The salts are a good size for dissolving and big enough for the customer to recognize quality.</li>
    <li> We use this in our hot tub. Makes our skin soft and is safe for the grandkids.We LOVE it! Great</li>
    <li> I thought I would try this salt as I was unable to get hold of my usual Dead Sea Spa Magik Salts which I have been using for about 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;The salts arrived and to my shock they smelt really horrible and looked dirty, I though I would try them in my bath anyway and to my disgust they made the water dirty and greasy with an awful smell, I dipped my elbow in and it actually hurt my psoriasis and left it stinging, I will not use these salts again obviously and will stick with Dead Sea Spa Magik, good clean pure Dead Sea Salts from the Dead Sea not from a contaminated swamp!!!</li>
    <li> I like to soak in the tub with the sea salts as it helps my skin feel rejuvenated and fresh.</li>
    <li> I enjoy relaxing in a hot mineral bath without scented products -- just natural, dead sea minerals.  They are expensive when purchased through Whole Foods or other specialty markets, and I am so happy to find an online venue that ships 20 pounds quickly.  Am loving the convenience and the results.</li>
