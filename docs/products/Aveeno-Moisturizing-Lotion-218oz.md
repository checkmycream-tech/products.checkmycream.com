<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> dont recommend To buy this product. Item is over priced</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin or any issues with itching or burning patches, this is the lotion for you!  I have used other so-called lotions for dry skin and this is by far the best.  It leaves my skin very soft and it relieves itching as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is unscented which is my preference.</li>
    <li> Aveeno lotion is very good in my opinion.  I prefer it over many of the other name brands (st ives, nivea, jergens, etc.).  I&#x27;d suggest you buy a small tube of all lotions and try them out for a day.  One lotion doesn&#x27;t work on all skin types so it is really hard to tell someone they should switch over to this.  So try them all and see what works best for your skin :-)</li>
    <li> Great price, fast delivery, and this is a great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very useful to keep skin wet. But I intend to buy the body wash instead of the body lotion.</li>
    <li> Works well. Have used it a long time. I would recommend it for people with dry skin most.  Works for me.</li>
    <li> Wonderful skin care product, have used it for ages and plan to continue.  Also very good price here and the seller is great to work with.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, stays on for many hours.  Best moisturizer I have ever tried, among many brands including body shop and L&#x27;occitane. It doesn&#x27;t have any funky or sweet smell, which I liked.</li>
    <li> I always buy the twin pack at Costco - It is $15 there. Love the product, but find yourself a better deal - assuming that you use enough of the product to make Costco membership worthwhile!</li>
    <li> Works great for Winter time dry skin, good price.</li>
    <li> The best lotion. I don&#x27;t use any other brand.</li>
    <li> It leaves your skin moisturized, without being greasy. There is no smell that would detract from your favorite perfume&lt;br /&gt;or cause allergies.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing lotion.  The only issue I had is that BOTH bottles pumps were broken so I had to unscrew and pour the lotion into my hands with each use.  I always ended up using too much.</li>
    <li> I think was exactly what I expected and came earlier than I thought it Would. I was thrilled.  Excellent price too.</li>
    <li> Very good and smooth without fragrance</li>
    <li> This lotion works great.  My sister has a hard time keeping her hands soft and loves this lotion.  She also has very sensitive skin (face) and this is the only thing that she can put on her face without breaking out in a rash.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the last ten years, and have been consistently happy with the results.  It moisturizes skin without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I bought these on 26th Feb 15 and the expiry date is Jul 2015, less than 6 months for to finish 2 bottles</li>
    <li> Aveeno is the only lotion that actually seems to moisturize my skin. I have extremely dry skin that gets itchy if I don&#x27;t moisturize sometimes twice a day. I love the fact that this lotion has no smell and does not leave a sheen on my skin, nor does my skin feel greasy to the touch. I use this lotion on my face and body and feel that it has drastically improved my skin tone - no longer red in the t-zone - and I have fewer breakouts along my jaw line. I gave it four instead of 5 stars as this lotion does the trick, but the Aveeno body souffle works better.</li>
    <li> This lotion is excellent for very dry skin.  It soaks in, and leaves my skin soft and silky.  It is unscented so doesn&#x27;t class with any fragrance I may choose to wear in the evening.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I gave it four stars instead of five because one of the bottles arrived with a broken tip on the plunger dispenser. However I&#x27;m only going to use one bottle at a time and I can easily move the good dispenser to the other bottle when I&#x27;m ready. I did not try to get it exchanged because it was not worth the trouble although I&#x27;m sure Amazon would do it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had dry skin but now that I&#x27;m over 60 nothing has worked to well to hydrate.  Aveeno works far better than any of the many other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to add that this product is a #2 on the Environmental Working Group (EWG) skin deep website, that is a very good rating in terms of additives and chemicals of concern. Buying a moisturizer can be a very personal thing but for me, it is a soothing lotion and non-greasy</li>
    <li> I suffer from very dry skin and one application a day of this lotion takes care of the problem. It isn&#x27;t overly greasy and makes your skin feel soft. I tried other lotions, both cheaper and more expensive and this one works the best.</li>
    <li> If you have dry and sensitive skin you need this.  Over the years, I have struggled to find a lotion that is moisturizing and does not irritate my skin.  I really don&#x27;t like scented lotions because they tend to be too irritating.  Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion truly has no scent and does an amazing job of moisturizing even in the middle of winter.  I have found nothing that works better.  Further, it does not leave an oily or greasy feeling like so many other brands that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This twin set is a fantastic deal!</li>
    <li> Moisturizing, relatively quick absorbancy, easy-to-use packaging.  Keeps my very dry skin in check.  Lightweight, faint pleasant smell, it&#x27;s the only lotion I use.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion.  I have dry/sensitive skin and have used different creams and lotions over the years trying to keep my skin hydrated.  This really lasts the whole day!  My skin has never been softer.  I am an Aveeno fan for life.</li>
    <li> We get through a lot of moisturizer because of the low humidity in fall through spring and this is a good product because of both quality and price. Personally I don&#x27;t use it for face but hands and body is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. There is a light fragrance but it is not an issue nor does it linger and the pump dispenser it easy to use.</li>
    <li> This moisture is so wonderful!  I buy the fragrance free because of skin sinsitivities &amp; put this on every night when I go to bed, and in the morning before I leave the house.  I keep one at home and one at the office...the perfect 2-pack.</li>
    <li> If you know anything about Aveeno products, then you know their lotion is one of the best on the market today.  It does cost a bit more than average but does and excellent job of moisturizing the driest skin without leaving it greasy.  The twin pack is a good deal and worth every penny.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion out there, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  Penetrates skin, and practically unscented, which I like.</li>
    <li> After years of suffering from dermatitis, I FINALLY found something that I can use from head to toe, literally. I am a Black female with afro hair and I slather this lotion on my hair daily as well as on my skin. I love it. I don&#x27;t get any icky build-up or oiliness on my hair or skin. This product is fragrance-free and lacks the weird chemical smell that a lot of &amp;#34;fragrance-free&amp;#34; products tend to have.</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer after my daily shower.  Winter flakey skin is a thing of the past for me.  Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my sensitive skin, as it contains no harsh chemicals. I buy in bulk, because I&#x27;ve become loyal to the product. Even Dove&#x27;s Original scent and chemicals (though I love the scent) are too strong.</li>
    <li> Best skin lotion on the market!</li>
    <li> I have used for a long time and it works great in my skin. But I discover that when I use it I will not get bitten by mosquitos!!!!</li>
    <li> Now, I haven&#x27;t had too much experience with lotions and such... however, I know a good lotion from a bad one. This is the best in my book.</li>
    <li> aveeno lotion is top notch really like it a pricey but worth it to me o refer aveeno to my family members</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I love this brand, this moisture body is excellent for hydrating your body, and is fragrance free I like it.</li>
    <li> ANOTHER GREAT PRODUCT USE IT FOR MY FEET.</li>
    <li> Great price on a great product.</li>
    <li> Absorbs well not leaving skin oily. No fragrance to be bothersome. Great for dry skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion is unscented and non greasy. It really makes my skin soft. Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This is the one and only lotion for me.</li>
    <li> This was my first time purchasing Aveeno Moisturizing Lotion.  I hate oily feeling lotions and I do not like a perfume smell either, and this Aveeno lotion is not oily nor does it have any odor/smell to it.  Living on a ranch in East Texas, I was my hands constantly and have to wear gloves all the time around our animals, the leather gloves really dry out mine and my husbands hands, and dealing with 20-50 mile an hour winds.  Our hands and arms and face are always dry, but my husband will rarely use a lotion on his skin because he is very oily and lotions normally make it worse or causes him to break out.  Not Aveeno Lotion it does not make your skin oily it goes on super easy blends easily and has no order to it,  seems almost like a water base lotion.  Overall I highly recommend this lotion to those who have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> After years of itchy back and skin all over my body, Aveeno Moisturizing Lotion works the best.  It soaks in quickly and completely.  I can tell the difference 12 hours later.  I have tried many lotions over the decades and this one is my favorite.  If you have an itchy back, check out &amp;#34;Body Buddy Non-Absorbent Lotion Applicator.&amp;#34;  The two eliminated my itchy back.  F. Parker</li>
    <li> Help with my stretch marks while I was pregnant. Not saying it will stop stretch marks, but it kept me moisturized while pregnant.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, it&#x27;s all I use especially during winter.</li>
    <li> Fast, efficient shipping.  Product exactly as listed.  Leaves my skin soft but not oily.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This lotion keeps my skin moisturized all day long.  Just wish it didnt leave my skin as oily as it does.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion and this is an amazing deal. This lotion works wonders for dry skin especially in the winter. It protects your skin</li>
    <li> Aveeno lotion is excellent to calm itchy and flakey skin, especially on eczema.  Excellent product I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> CAME ON TIME!!! I will order this lotion again..thankyou!!!</li>
    <li> Best moisturising lotion out there, IMHO</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the extra money! Non-greasy and long lasting moisture for your skin. It&#x27;s especially good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Keeps my limbs nice and smooth even after a day of hard work.</li>
    <li> Not the cheapest but works well and not greasy. A family favorite at our house for several years. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> This year the eczema was worse than usual and I wasn&#x27;t moisturizing as I should have been, so I ended up with welts, huge patches of scaly, itching and burning skin and it was spreading. When I thought I couldn&#x27;t take one more day of it, I gently dry brushed my legs and put this lotion on and by morning, the welts were gone and the patches were no longer inflamed and were very faint. I will not go without this again. I love all Aveeno&#x27;s products, they do what they say they will and they will be a staple in our home.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this works for me.</li>
    <li> Love this, have used it for years.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, I use it on my face too. It&#x27;s $15 at costco vs. the $20+ it is on Amazon right now though.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how amazing this is. I&#x27;ve tried several different lotions and creams and can&#x27;t find the cure for my dry cracked hands. Not only does winter make me dry out rapidly but working at a restaurant I wash my hands hundreds of times a day and my hands hurt.&lt;br /&gt;I have a couple thinner lotions so they dry quicker and I make sure they&#x27;re non scented but they burn for the first few mins! They help but nothing to brag about. I read a review by a man that had dry cracked hands. Worked with his hands a lot and washed a lot as well said in 2 applications  it fixed his problem.&lt;br /&gt;I figured why not?! I found this product in store but smaller. Kind of tired spending 7-15 bucks on something I don&#x27;t use. Bought the tiny, in your purse kind. I&#x27;ve used it twice. LOVE IT!!&lt;br /&gt;My hands were rough,cracked, bleeding.. Just ow..&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no fragrance. It&#x27;s light weight, dries quick, not expensive and works the best in the 7 I have.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t brag this up enough!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading what it could do for my winter dry skin...never ever using it before. I used it the very day it was delivered and I must say, it&#x27;s like a miracle! My dry skin itching has stopped and I am feelin better! Just remember to apply the lotion every day. GREAT PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my Mom and she loves them. The smell of this lotion is really pleasant and the texture is not all that sticky; it is absorbed really well with in the skin.</li>
    <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. Stays on all day.</li>
    <li> I have a bit of recurring dry skin on my face and this is the only lotion that I&#x27;ve found that helps me personally.</li>
    <li> This is another gift for my daughter and her family.  Aveeno is one of her favorite products.  The entire family is extremely satisfied with this product!</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin it works wonderful love it I recommend this product to anyone with this problems try it</li>
    <li> Great stuff-wife loves it!</li>
    <li> I purchase this for myself all the time and got some for my elderly mother who has severely dry and thin skin.  Her skin has responded wonderfully and she loves the product as much as I do.  Natural oatmeal does the trick.</li>
    <li> Keep this on my table with the car keys and use it daily</li>
    <li> I have been using Aveeno for years and this double pack is a great value! I buy it once every few months and it is enough for daily use for myself and my husband. It goes on smooth and silky and dries fast, keeps you moisturized all day even in dry climates like the California high desert! I highly recommend Aveeno products in general.</li>
    <li> Use this everyday on my arms and legs. Keeps them smooth during cold weather.</li>
    <li> Great for people with dry skin, sensitive skin or eczema. Goes on fine and does not leave residue.</li>
    <li> Great lotion for men no flowery odor and works great.</li>
    <li> My whole family has very sensitive skin and this is the only lotion we have found to work well on all of us.  We have been using it for years and love it soooooo much!</li>
    <li> The best body cream that I have found.</li>
    <li> I have been useing this product for as long as its been out.  Love,love,love it..No nore greasey hands or legs...</li>
    <li> was great, got them real fast thankyou</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my Aveeno Moisturizing Lotion as usual</li>
    <li> Have used Aveeno for ages and love it, love it...never greasy and takes away the dryness of my hands.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion...and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of lotions through the years.  It soaks into your skin very nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy.  It really does help with dry skin, especially in the winter and when you work with paper a lot.  I keep some at work all the time and it is one of the few lotions that I can put on and not to have to keep pointing more and more on as the day goes on.  A little bit goes a long way and it really does soothe dry skin and keep it from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is the fact that it is fragrance free and when you have allergies or work in an office with people who have allergies, you don&#x27;t have to worry so much about bothering them with overly floral or strongly citrus scents.  It also means my guy friends can use it without thinking they&#x27;re going to end up smelling like a flower garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy the big bottles for at home and get a small one for taking with me.  Great product!</li>
    <li> It works like a dream and stops the itch fast and last&#x27;s 24hrs or more. You&#x27;ll really love this product it works.</li>
    <li> One of the few lotions that don&#x27;t cause my skin to redden up. A little more expense than you can get elsewhere.</li>
    <li> ,.RECOMMENDED .... QUALITY AND DESIGN....VERY GOOD PRICE IN SALE ....VERY GOOD PRODUCT ....RECOMMENDED .... QUALITY AND DESIGN....VERY GOOD PRICE IN SALE ....VERY GOOD PRODUCT ....RECOMMENDED ..</li>
    <li> i love Aveeno lotion.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and it keeps skin moist.</li>
    <li> Avenno product is reliable and reasonably prices. My skin used to be so dry and itched a lot. Now it&#x27;s amply moisturised without any fragrance. I like the large pump, which dispenses lotion well.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizing lotion I have ever used.  The fact that is has oatmeal in its formula makes a big difference.  This is recommended by dermatologists by far.  It was a great buy also</li>
    <li> Good product.  Effective for dry hands.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has been keeping my hands and elbows moisturized all winter.</li>
    <li> great product as are all I have tried from this company</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best daily moisturizer I have found for the price.  The fact that it&#x27;s fragrance free is great............it doesn&#x27;t get all mixed up with the daily fragrance that I use.</li>
