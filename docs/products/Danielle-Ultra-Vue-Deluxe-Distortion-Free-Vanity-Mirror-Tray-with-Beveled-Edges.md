      <li>Fit about 10 bottles easy.</li>
      <li>I had been searching for the ideal tray for our wide bathroom sink counter for quite some time.  </li>
      <li>Came boxed with bubble wrap to keep it secure..</li>
      <li>Cheap look &amp; quality.  </li>
      <li>Looks pretty, but quality is just OK.</li>
      <li>This perfume tray is very pretty.</li>
      <li>Looks very pretty on my dresser.  </li>
      <li>I  received this beautiful piece like so many others with a broken side rail.</li>
      <li>GREAT LITTLE TRAY</li>
      <li>This tray is such a nice accent to my dressing area.</li>
      <li>My only main issue was that they put a sticker on the glass and it took me a good fifteen minutes to get it off.</li>
      <li>Very pretty and looks exactly like what it is showed in the picture.  </li>
      <li>Just the right size for my dresser....</li>
      <li>, IT&#x27;S JUST THE RIGHT SIZE TO HOLD ALL MY PERFUMES WITHOUT TAKING UP A LOT OF SPACE.</li>
      <li>Looks smart on the granite countertop!</li>
      <li>It got here quickly, was packed real well</li>
      <li>With all of the snow we have had, it arrived shortly after Christmas, but just in time to warm her heart for the new year!</li>
      <li>The first one i bought broke en route</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a mirror with some fru-fru on top, but looks nice between the sinks on our vanity, and keeps daily use items corralled.</li>
      <li>Exactly like the pic.</li>
      <li>I keep this tray on top of a small set of drawers on top of a table.  </li>
      <li>it appears to be a decent product and worth the $19.00</li>
      <li>fast shipping too.</li>
      <li>It is not pampered and has stood up very well.</li>
      <li>Purchased this as a gift for my daughter who is very picky.</li>
      <li>Perfume bottles really sparkle on it.</li>
      <li>The few decorative items that I place on the tray lift quickly and easily off of the set of drawers so that I can dust or open the top of the set of drawers which has extra storage.  </li>
      <li>With just a little nail polish remover on a clean tissue, the glue came right off without much effort at all</li>
      <li>To be fair, had the tray arrived without a broken bar and if I wanted to take the time to remove the sticker (why they didn&#x27;t put the sticker on the bottom of the mirror i will never know)</li>
      <li>I have several cut glass containers on it making the entire look sparkling and clean.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a classy way to store your perfumes/colognes on your dresser or vanity.</li>
      <li>a few extra inches would have allowed several more items within our every day reach.  </li>
      <li>Very delicate and fragile but nice.</li>
      <li>Other than that small grievance, I love this tray.</li>

    <li> This was a very nice mirror, fit on the top of my toilet tank perfectly. Shipment packaging was very good, but one of the plastic bars was still shattered. I chose to use it without shipping it back.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful tray!  It goes great in our newly redecorated bathroom.      Shipped very quickly without a scratch or dent.  There is a sticker on the front as previous reviews indicated (not sure why they would do such a thing) but after peeling the sticker off, there was still some glue left on the mirror.  With just a little nail polish remover on a clean tissue, the glue came right off without much effort at all and you can&#x27;t even tell it was ever there.      I&#x27;m very pleased with the product!  Would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This tray is such a nice accent to my dressing area. Perfume bottles really sparkle on it. If you love pretty perfume bottles, this is a nice way to display them.</li>
    <li> This vanity tray is made beautifully...Just the right size for my dresser....Came boxed with bubble wrap to keep it secure..Came when they promised..</li>
    <li> I received this item and one of the plastic bars was broken.  It is not worth it to me to return but I am disappointed because had I chosen to listen to the other reviewer&#x27;s comments regarding the sticky sticker and fragile quality of the product I might have saved some money.      To be fair, had the tray arrived without a broken bar and if I wanted to take the time to remove the sticker (why they didn&#x27;t put the sticker on the bottom of the mirror i will never know) it appears to be a decent product and worth the $19.00 +/-.  I hope this review helps you make an more informed decision.  -</li>
    <li> Very beautiful and very nicely packaged but am returning because it is very small. Very delicate and fragile but nice.</li>
    <li> I use this mirror tray to display my perfume bottles, and it does a beautiful job.  It arrived well-packaged with no imperfections whatsoever. My only complaint is everyone else&#x27;s: the very inconveniently placed sticker that took a while to fully remove from the mirror. It was towards the edge and halfway under one of the little ledges.  Other than that small grievance, I love this tray.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a classy way to store your perfumes/colognes on your dresser or vanity. Fit about 10 bottles easy.</li>
    <li> My wife was very pleased with the vanity perfume tray.  With all of the snow we have had, it arrived shortly after Christmas, but just in time to warm her heart for the new year!</li>
    <li> This product made my perfumes look beautiful on my dresser. My only main issue was that they put a sticker on the glass and it took me a good fifteen minutes to get it off.</li>
    <li> The tray&#x27;s glass arm had fallen off in shipping but was easily reattached and it looks great.  I am not sure the arm would stay in place if the tray was jostled around alot but it will not be so I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Product came broken. The metal corners are spot welded (if you can even call it \\&quot;spot welded\\&quot;). With little movement, the entire railing system just fell apart and is impossible to fix unless you start gluing stuff.    Don&#x27;t buy this. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I  received this beautiful piece like so many others with a broken side rail. I knew I was in trouble when I picked up the box and heard a rattle. The one end rod and side rail had come apart. I am going to try and glue it rather than go thru the trouble of sending it back.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is horrible. The box was put inside a bigger box with no packaging materiel so it just slid all over in there. Why dont they do something about this? I was going to order a different mirror from this company but not now.</li>
    <li> Very pretty and looks exactly like what it is showed in the picture.  fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> GREAT LITTLE TRAY, IT&#x27;S JUST THE RIGHT SIZE TO HOLD ALL MY PERFUMES WITHOUT TAKING UP A LOT OF SPACE.</li>
    <li> I had been searching for the ideal tray for our wide bathroom sink counter for quite some time.  When I saw this one I realized my search had ended.  And when I received it, I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  It&#x27;s sleek, it&#x27;s contemporary and most of all it looks great on the counter.  I have several cut glass containers on it making the entire look sparkling and clean.  The glass dowels add to the sparkle and shine plus they prevent any containers from falling off it.  One thought for anyone looking for an item such as this.  Make sure the width is appropriate for your needs.  My mistake -- a few extra inches would have allowed several more items within our every day reach.  That being said, I love this one anyway.  It will be sufficient for my needs.</li>
    <li> Great product. The first one i bought broke en route and i received a replacement in record time. It fits well with my bathroom.</li>
    <li> beautiful for my husbands bath for colognes and it fit the space I wanted it in perfectly.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift for my daughter who is very picky. It got here quickly, was packed real well and she loves it.</li>
    <li> The joints were a little irregular and the tray seems a bit fragile but I have it in my bathroom with perfumes bottles on it and it looks awesome. Cleaning around the bars is also a little challenging but for the price, it is an awesome find.</li>
    <li> Very nice product for the price.  Looks just like the pictures and my daughter loves it for displaying all her perfumes.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Can now store my perfumes on my vanity. Looks great and arrived with zero damage. Bigger than expected. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Exactly like the pic. Very nice!</li>
    <li> Cheap look &amp; quality.  It is not worth the price. Did not meet my expectation.  Dose not look as good as the picture.</li>
    <li> As I opened the item, that was tightly packed. I noticed that the bars were not attached to the mirror. This item should have been properly assembled prior to being delivered. I&#x27;m very disappointed about the defective item and I would not recommend this item to anyone in the future.</li>
    <li> The tray is a little flimsy as is but I was able to shore it up without a problem.  Nice looking.</li>
    <li> Very attractive tray fits in perfectly between the sides of my triple mirror.  Quickly dispatched and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Looks pretty, but quality is just OK.</li>
    <li> I purchased this tray in September 2007.  I use it to hold candles in the bathroom.  It is not pampered and has stood up very well.</li>
    <li> Looks very pretty on my dresser.  It&#x27;s prettier than I expected.  There is a sticker on the glass which takes awhile to get off but that wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a mirror with some fru-fru on top, but looks nice between the sinks on our vanity, and keeps daily use items corralled.</li>
    <li> This perfume tray is very pretty. The perfume bottles line so nicely because of the length. It allows you to view your scents easier. This is a very nice tray and for the price you can not beat it. I am very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I keep this tray on top of a small set of drawers on top of a table.  The few decorative items that I place on the tray lift quickly and easily off of the set of drawers so that I can dust or open the top of the set of drawers which has extra storage.  It is sturdy and easy to handle.  Very good quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use in my bathroom at Christmas.  It was reasonably priced, and the quality is good.  It would look good on a dresser, too, I think.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my vanity. Makes it all look &amp;#34;put-together&amp;#34;. Am purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Happy with it! Not too big, not too small!</li>
    <li> The item arrived as scheduled and was packed fairly well. Nothing was cracked or broken. It holds quite a few bottles of perfume and lotion. I was concerned about the width but it&#x27;s enough. Good purchase for the price.  Looks smart on the granite countertop!</li>
