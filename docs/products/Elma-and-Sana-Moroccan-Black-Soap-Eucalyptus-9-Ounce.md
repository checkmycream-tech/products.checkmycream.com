      <li>Using this along with the rose water as a toner has made my skin even more radiant.</li>

      <li>then I use the moroccan exfoliating glove or magic peeling glove to exfoliate.</li>
      <li>I use this product with the exfoliating mitt and it works fantastic!</li>
      <li>or maybe it is moisturizing more than I realize.  </li>

      <li>The smell is not my favorite, but who cares?</li>

      <li>I did have more luck with the Earth Therapeutics Exfoliating Hydro Gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>About a year ago, I had read about the Baden mitten, which was receiving a lot of attention for its apparently amazing ability to exfoliate skin to baby smooth softness.</li>
      <li>I wish it smelled better</li>
      <li>Over all I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I think i might fall more in love with this product when my skin starts seeing the benefits.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 46 and don&#x27;t look it and don&#x27;t intend to, so that means more maintenance.</li>
      <li>best possible results, combine using this with [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>I was expecting great exfoliating action, but almost none happened.  </li>
      <li>love the texture, I lightly spread some on my buff puff and wash my face etc.</li>
      <li>It started with very winter-weary skin and the search for a good self-tanner.</li>
      <li>feel like maybe it does something more than clean without residue</li>
      <li>This version has a light helping of Eucalyptus Oil in it, which is very nice and complements the naturally nutty smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Once a week, I scrub down with this excellent product.</li>
      <li>the best Moroccan black soap I have use</li>
      <li>but it washed just fine anyway.</li>
      <li>It smells great and when used with an exfoliating mit leaves my skin super soft.</li>
      <li>they claim that its a super natural product great for your skin</li>
      <li>you for having it now available for all of us here in mexico</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I enjoy the product, I had to move it all into another container as I&#x27;m not taking a chance on re-injuring myself.  </li>
      <li>I was really excited to try this product</li>

      <li>make sure to take a hot bath or 10 min steam shower before using this and the mitt.</li>
      <li>but my skin smells clean</li>
      <li>It does amazingly soften skin, even calluses, and works perfectly with a defoliating mitt to scrub away dead skin cells &amp; leave skin super soft &amp; smooth--simple instructions are included.</li>
      <li>Makes me feel squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>just clean and fresh.&lt;br</li>
      <li>nice smell, leaves my skin clean and soft.  </li>
      <li>I leave it on for 5 or more minutes depending on how much time I have</li>
      <li>This really helps exfoliate and smooth out the skin!</li>
      <li>Must use with exfoliating glove to get the full benefits.</li>
      <li>My face feels so fresh and clean after using it.</li>
      <li>Luckily, around the time I had resolved to go ahead and shell out the money for the Baden mitten, I happened to see this product while browsing on Amazon&#x27;s website.</li>
      <li>Elma and Sana Moroccan Black soap is great.</li>
      <li>Just used this product for the first time today so can&#x27;t say much about it, however i love the consistency.</li>
      <li>It leaves skin very sof and smooth.</li>
      <li>n fresh not like the soap</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>Most include essential oils of one sort or another to create their own signature scent or whatnot, but mostly what you want is one with minimal additives.</li>
      <li>Skin will be clean and soft without a strong fragrance.</li>
      <li>I also like the idea of something more natural.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brand and will be buying more of their products in the future.</li>
      <li>I already use their 100% pure Moroccan rose water and love it and decided to try other products and they don&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
      <li>So I was pretty happy when I came across Elma and Sana Moroccan Black soap on Amazon.</li>
      <li>, I did find exactly the right things to do it and it does, in fact, still make the skin glow</li>
      <li>Read some good reviews on this black soap and thought I would try it with an exfoliating glove.  </li>
      <li>I imagine it would be fine for sensitive skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is exactly like the stuff that was used during my hamam experience in Morocco.  I am very, very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this soap. It smells great and when used with an exfoliating mit leaves my skin super soft.</li>
    <li> This Moroccan black soap smells, feels, and performs exactly like the black soap my friends and I bought in Morocco to take with us to the local hammams (baths). It does amazingly soften skin, even calluses, and works perfectly with a defoliating mitt to scrub away dead skin cells &amp; leave skin super soft &amp; smooth--simple instructions are included. It is similar to the raw \\&quot;black soap\\&quot; available in West Africa, and unlike the so-called \\&quot;black soap\\&quot; sold in the USA as a foaming bar soap. This is a product more American women should learn about! Thanks, Elma &amp; Sana!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0006MVTJ8 Riffi Original Massage Mitt]]</li>
    <li> I got this on recommendation for pre cleaning before using the Baiden mitten. I&#x27;m not sure how much it really makes a difference over just using my old neutrogena (the main point is you can&#x27;t have a soap that leaves any residue or it won&#x27;t work). My neutrogena and plain old Ivory both left no residue. Not sure if this Moroccan Black Soap enables MORE exfoliation than they would or what else it might do, but the smell simply puts me in HEAVEN.&lt;br /&gt;I love the texture, I lightly spread some on my buff puff and wash my face etc. with it and I simply can not get ENOUGH of this scent!  It&#x27;s just a heady mix of eucalyptus and maybe some smoky wood, who knows what else, but I&#x27;m crazy for it!&lt;br /&gt;I feel like maybe it does something more than clean without residue, I don&#x27;t know what, maybe it&#x27;s \\&quot;good\\&quot; for my skin in some healthful way beyond other soaps, I don&#x27;t know. But I just plain love it. It really adds an element of spa-like aroma delight to my shower experience.</li>
    <li> make sure to take a hot bath or 10 min steam shower before using this and the mitt. otherwise nothing will come off. but if you do as instructions say you will see pieces of dead skin coming off. this soap not the easiest to use. it is like a brown jelly. I apply some all over the body and put some on the mitt or my salux towel, then with a lot of pressure wash the skin. it takes the self tanner off. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this soap for the face. It stings your eyes like crazy</li>
    <li> Just used this product for the first time today so can&#x27;t say much about it, however i love the consistency. Wish it lathered a little bit more but it washed just fine anyway. I think i might fall more in love with this product when my skin starts seeing the benefits. Will probably be buying again. Not a very large tub however, wish there was more product</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost a year now and have found enough tips to give a review with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Use a mitten based scrubber. I did not have any luck with the Chaacoca Moroccan Exfoliating Mitt keeping enough of the soap on it to not scrape my skin. I did have more luck with the Earth Therapeutics Exfoliating Hydro Gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Shower in hot water and when you are ready to wash with this soap, turn the shower off. Apply a quarter to half dollar size of the soap to the mitten and start washing. Make sure the mitten is sufficiently wet before applying the soap. I have been using one mitten for washing, taking it off one hand and putting it on the other hand backwards to get the most washing surface area with out using extra soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Do not wash areas that may be sensitive to Eucalyptus oils&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Do not wash areas where you have a cut, scrape, pimple, or any where you want enough air flow to help dry out the skin for healing or applying medications or creams to help the healing process. I have had some pimples and cuts that I had repeatedly washed with this soap that took longer than usual to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* If you use a file on your feet to get rid of calloused skin, you may not want to wash those areas with this soap. It tends to seal in those calloused skin cells and it seem harder to file away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It has helped in cutting down ingrown hairs on my legs from using an epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* When washing with this soap, be sure to scrub areas where you know you have dry skin to remove it and seal the areas moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* After rinsing off, you will feel like a waxed cucumber. This is great if you want to use conditioner in your hair after with out feeling like your coated in conditioner.</li>
    <li> I received this today and based on the reviews couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.  My skin feels so soft.  I used this with one of the Moroccan exfoliating mitts and my skin is smoother than it has felt in a long time.  I recommend!!</li>
    <li> im still on tht fence about this... the smell is not that great, i think it wwas working with the mit... i really am not a fan of the odor this has.</li>
    <li> minty scent, works very well, my skin feels clean but not dry after using it. The product is a gelatinous consistency, so think about getting a tool to use (bath mit, sponge, etc) along with the product.</li>
    <li> I like the product...nice smell, leaves my skin clean and soft.  But the lid is a killer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lid is comprised of a metal cap that fits over the plastic jar lid.  It overhangs the plastic by a fraction of an inch...just enough so when I tried to unscrew the cap with wet hands, that sharp metal edge sliced through my thumb and first 2 fingers quite deeply!  Be very careful if your hands are the slightest bit damp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I enjoy the product, I had to move it all into another container as I&#x27;m not taking a chance on re-injuring myself.  Please, Elma and Sana....change the lid to have the metal no longer than the cap or get rid of the metal cap completely!  I&#x27;m not sure if I would reorder this product unless the company changes the design of the lid.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I have bought this product. the first two times I was very happy with it. It reminded me of the authentic soaps of my childhood in Africa! The quality and the smell were great. This around there is hardly any eucalyptus smell, and the soap is not as moisturizing as normal. In fact there is a sort of rancid small of olives about to go off!!. The consistency of the product has changed too. I am not sure if I will buy it again. :(</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this product even told BF about ordering it. My skin has been really dry and itchy so I was looking forward to the promised spa like super soft skim treatment.  I think it&#x27;s going back ... So far this is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) smells like cow dropping covered over with pine tar (I grew up in a eucalyptus groove and this isn&#x27;t what it smelled like - ever).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) decided to put aside my dislike for the smell and try it anyway.  the substance is difficult to warm in your hands to get it to a non gel like form but with enough steam and heat, it did spread though it took more like a few tablespoons for a complete bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I think it did have a softening effect though nothing that wowed me more than a salt bath with a good oil does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)  they claim that its a super natural product great for your skin but it contains Sodium hydroxide also known as caustic soda, or lye.  Though this is a common ingredient  in soap, I found conflicting information on its safety for use in soap.  Mainly it seemed important that it was used in small quantities and dissolved properly.  I&#x27;m not sure about this, but I do find it misleading to market a product as super natural and chemical free and then include use of lye -  Basically the stuff you&#x27;re trying to get away from when you spend $17 for a small dollop of the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update if I find different information or decide to keep it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can google Sodium hydroxide MSDS (material safety data sheet):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Potential Acute Health Effects:&lt;br /&gt;Very hazardous in case of skin contact (corrosive, irritant, permeator), of eye contact (irritant, corrosive), of ingestion,&lt;br /&gt;of inhalation. The amount of tissue damage depends on length of contact. Eye contact can result in corneal damage or blindness. Skin contact can produce inflammation and blistering. Inhalation of dust will produce irritation to gastro-intestinal or respiratory tract, characterized by burning, sneezing and coughing. Severe over-exposure can produce lung damage, choking, unconsciousness or death. Inflammation of the eye is characterized by redness, watering, and itching. Skin inflammation is characterized by itching, scaling, reddening, or, occasionally, blistering.&lt;br /&gt;Potential Chronic Health Effects:&lt;br /&gt;CARCINOGENIC EFFECTS: Not available. MUTAGENIC EFFECTS: Mutagenic for mammalian somatic cells. TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Not available. DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY: Not available. The substance may be toxic to mucous membranes, upper respiratory tract, skin, eyes. Repeated or prolonged exposure to the substance can produce target organs damage. Repeated exposure of the eyes to a low level of dust can produce eye irritation. Repeated skin exposure can produce local skin destruction, or dermatitis. Repeated inhalation of dust can produce varying degree of respiratory irritation or lung damage.</li>
    <li> Really nice product. Makes me feel squeaky clean. It does moisturize, but you must exfoliate as well. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is very different, almost like a thick gel.  I had to get used to how much I should use, but after a few times I got it right.  I use it with the Chaacoca Moroccan Exfoliating Mitt and love how my skin feels afterward!</li>
    <li> What a great product, I&#x27;m so glad I ordered it! I already use their 100% pure Moroccan rose water and love it and decided to try other products and they don&#x27;t disappoint. My face feels so fresh and clean after using it. I feel like it really removes every trace of makeup when I use it at night and in the morning it makes my skin feel refreshed. Using this along with the rose water as a toner has made my skin even more radiant. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brand and will be buying more of their products in the future. They really deliver what they promise - great quality and great results.</li>
    <li> This soap smells and feels the same as the soap used in the Moroccan hamaam I went to in Paris years ago. I use this almost daily, and I&#x27;m too impatient to use this the traditional way, so after being in the shower for a minute or so, I put a small glob of the soap on a kessa mitt, and scrub the same way I would with a loofah or washcloth, just spending a bit more time on the scrubbing part. Dead skin doesn&#x27;t roll away the way it does when this is done in the hamaam; perhaps because of the frequency with which I use it. After the shower, I apply oil or lotion to my skin. I&#x27;m 38, and my skin literally feels like a baby&#x27;s skin after doing this. I am in awe at how soft my skin is. Its not as convenient as using body wash, but you will have the best skin of your life if you are consistent with use.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even know about this until I was reading about exfoliating.  I usually made my own salt scrub. I then saw this and decided to try it to prepare for an air brush tan for a wedding. It is real slippery and I know some gets wasted down the drain, but it certainly works well with the mitt. My skin does feel very soft after using.</li>
    <li> this product was overly drying for my skin type .It is difficult to spread around as it is like  a thick and waxy jelly. I won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> I ordered this after reading about Turkish hamam culture. I found the consistency a bit strange, but a little goes a long way. I use it with a Turkish exfoliating mitt and have just followed the directions for use. I always feel so soft afterward.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect ! It is just a bit higher in terms of the price compared to the actual Moroccan Black Soap. But it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love it.. the best Moroccan black soap I have use</li>
    <li> Just used this tonight with the chaacoca moroccan mitt and it was amazing! I love eucalyptus but my husband thinks it smells like pee, but i just tell him my plan to have him sleep on the couch is working. Don&#x27;t worry it doesn&#x27;t leave a scent behind on you skin. I don&#x27;t know if i would like the soap so much without the mitt, so i would recommend using it with a mitt or nubby washcloth.</li>
    <li> Great soap!! Exceeded my expectations! It smelled great very aroma therapy like and as it cleaned my skin it calmed my nerves. I will definently re order when my jar is done. Plus a little of the product goes a long way!! It&#x27;s a must to use the exfoliation loofah with it. Cleans all dead skin and is hypoallergenic. Hope this helps anyone who is hesitant.</li>
    <li> This is THE  BEST exfolient on the planet! Period. Of caurse, when used as directed. On a first few tries, I  was dissapointed, but  after reading the directions agai I discovered that I was not using it correctly. It has been a miracle for my skin eversince. The dead skin is coming off on the mitt right in front of your eyes. Amazing product.</li>
    <li> I was expecting great exfoliating action, but almost none happened.  So, I ordered the mitt, and still not as much as I was led to expect.  Plus, you have to give yourself enough time to have a long shower, then put the stuff on and let it sit, then you can start with the mitt.  I&#x27;d give it more stars if it finally produced results at that point, but it doesn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> I just had my 60th birthday and although I take care of myself I felt it was time to really kick up my beauty routines. It started with very winter-weary skin and the search for a good self-tanner. The tanner I ordered suggested a good exfoliating before use and I chose this product and the Chaacoca Moroccan Exfoliating Mitt. I followed the instructions, showering first, then turning off the water. The product is very thick, not unlike the rubber cement one reviewer referred to, so it was hard to just put on wet skin. I put a glob on the wet glove and started, feet up, rubbing. Once I had scrubbed my whole body I turned the water back on and used the glove to gently rub off the soap. I did use the soap on my face, not with the glove, but with my rotating facial brush. When I was finished I was glowing pink, but that passed quickly. I felt as if I had a new body. I had no irritation (I did the treatment yesterday) and I definitely look younger and my clothing all feels silky. I was afraid I would feel parched and dry the next day, but instead I feel the opposite. I am hooked!</li>
    <li> This is phthalate free and a natural alternative to traditional soap. The texture is sticky, almost tarry. You&#x27;ll need a loofa or some sort of puff to put a dab on and it will work into a nice foamy lather. A washcloth doesn&#x27;t work as well but it will do. Skin will be clean and soft without a strong fragrance. I imagine it would be fine for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch, but the stuff is the consistency of rubber cement, making it extremely difficult to get on your skin. Little blobs of it just kept falling onto the shower floor.  What did make it onto my skin along with the glove did exfoliate nicely, but nothing miraculous.</li>
    <li> I have used black soap before, albeit one from a French company that was a one-off purchase on sale because it was exorbitantly priced, but it was the happiest smell ever. So I was glad to see the ingredients olive oil and eucalyptus in this Moroccan soap. Open the lid, and you do get a refreshing whiff of eucalyptus, but only for a second. Underneath that, you can&#x27;t miss the smell of wet ash, or something like a house being plastered. The only other ingredient is sodium hydroxide, a caustic base (if you&#x27;ve got a natural formula containing olive oil and eucalyptus, why would you need NaOH?) I&#x27;m not keeping it.</li>
    <li> Smells weird and don&#x27;t notice a difference in the shower w the mitt.</li>
    <li> I live in the desert and my skin suffers the most from the dry air. Once a week, I scrub down with this excellent product. At once, my skin is glowing and rejuvenated. The effects last for quite a while. After a bath, my bathroom smells like a spa. The scent lasts a pretty long time.</li>
    <li> I tried my product today with my kae exfoliating hammam glove and I loved it. My skin is super soft! I didn&#x27;t need much so I&#x27;m sure it will last. As for the smell, I didn&#x27;t experience a foul smell at all. So do not believe those reviews of a bad smell. Over all I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I did not like it at all. This soap has consistency of rubber. I am not able to put it on my skin.  The smell is not good either. Since I started to use it I do not know if I can return it.</li>
    <li> On time delivery and the item is as described.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> a bit different than the original sabon el beldi, but the smell is better on this specific brand, texture same as the original as all</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the smell.  I still used it because the smell doesn&#x27;t stay on you.  Haven&#x27;t notice anything different with my skin after using a few times every week for more than a month.</li>
    <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been taking greater care of my skin. I&#x27;m 46 and don&#x27;t look it and don&#x27;t intend to, so that means more maintenance. During my travels I went to Turkey and there had real Turkish baths. Out of all the things I did there the glow and softness of my skin after those is the thing I remember most, so I decided to figure out how that happened and begin replicating it if possible. And no, I do not work for these people nor have I received anything for this review. I just really like their stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my search began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I did find exactly the right things to do it and it does, in fact, still make the skin glow like I rolled in shimmer powder and soft like the proverbial baby bottom. One key element is true Moroccan black soap. And this is the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best possible results, combine using this with [[ASIN:B004VSN3ME Chaacoca Moroccan Exfoliating Mitt]], or with a similar product. Then finish it off with [[ASIN:B00397XUIK ELMA&amp;SANA Golden Argan Oil ® 100 Cold Pressed Virgin Organic Certified By Ecocert -1oz(30ml)]] or another argan oil of your choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what is this Moroccan soap stuff, you might ask? The bottom line is that it is a combination of olive oils and solid olive pastes combined in a special way to create a cleansing and moisturing hard gel. Most include essential oils of one sort or another to create their own signature scent or whatnot, but mostly what you want is one with minimal additives. This version has a light helping of Eucalyptus Oil in it, which is very nice and complements the naturally nutty smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use this, you need only a smidgeon. I take a blob about the size of a coin and then divide it in half and press one half into each palm and then rub it in. That is enough for a whole body if you&#x27;re body is fairly regular sized. Turn the shower off while you do that and let it soak in while you condition your hair or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse it off and then use the glove to exfoliate, rinse and get out. While you&#x27;re skin is still warm, rub in argan oil and you&#x27;re done. It works and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t necessarily recommend this for teens who still have unruly skin that secretes too much oil unless they are cautious and test it first. It is an oil based soap and while it moisturizes well, I can&#x27;t attest to what it will do to very oily or acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone outside that, very highly recommended for moisturizing, cleansing and overall experience.e glove to exfoliate, rinse and get out.

    <li> This product used with a gd. exfolating mitt makes your skin soft and leaves it glowing. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> I thought I would love this product due to its natural ingredients but the container was open when I received it.&lt;br /&gt;Plus the consistency of the soap is almost impossible to use in or out of the shower,. it just clumps up.</li>
    <li> Elma and Sana Moroccan Black soap is great. This soap isn&#x27;t drying and is fair trade. This soap is great quality.</li>
    <li> Read some good reviews on this black soap and thought I would try it with an exfoliating glove.  It works wonderfully and makes your skin super smooth!</li>
    <li> My skin has been begging for some exfoliating this winter.  I&#x27;ve been thinking back fondly on how wonderful my skin looked and felt after visiting hammams when I lived in Morocco, so on a wild hair I went to see if I could duplicate the experience at home.  I found this product, ordered it and an exfoliating mitt and when they arrived, I went to town!  Best product ever!</li>
    <li> I am honestly not sure what this does for me and my skin.  I continue to use it with a scrubbing mitt.  I love the exfoliating mitt, but think that it works just as well with my regular soaps.  Maybe I am not paying enough attention to see the difference or maybe it is moisturizing more than I realize.  I see that a lot of other people really love it.</li>
    <li> I use this product with the exfoliating mitt and it works fantastic! It leaves skin very sof and smooth. It amazes me how much dead skin I have each time I use it. Make sure you read the directions! Just a little bit of soup goes a LONG way! I use it once a week after sitting in a hot bath for at least 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other brand of black soap before but couldn&#x27;t find it any more. So I was pretty happy when I came across Elma and Sana Moroccan Black soap on Amazon. I personally like the smell and consistency of this soap. It foams and cleans well if applied on a bath sponge/glove and not directly on skin. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Ive been to turkish baths n morocan hammams n this soap does the same thing- exfoliates to the max. Id def get the mitt too and i used it in a very warm shower. The soap lasts and a lil goes a long way. I wish it smelled better but my skin smells clean n fresh not like the soap so its all good.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Does not lather due to the consistency &#x3D; very sticky like a wax. If you rub on the skin hard enough, dead skin is supposed to come off with the help of this soap. Must use with exfoliating glove to get the full benefits.</li>
    <li> This makes my skin feel extremely clean and it smells up my whole bathroom and smells wonderful.  I also like the idea of something more natural.</li>
    <li> It only takes a little bit to do the trick.  My skin feels soft and smooth after using this with the Chaacoca Moroccan Exfoliating Mitt ([[ASIN:B004VSN3ME B004VSN3ME]]</li>
    <li> Very undesirable texture - too slimy and unappealing.  Didn&#x27;t use it.  Even the scent let me down.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I will never use regular soap again. This leaves skin clean and soft. Doesn&#x27;t dry it out or smell like an Irish Spring.... just clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing, is that it is cumbersome to keep dipping in the container. Maybe cause I&#x27;m just not used to it.</li>
    <li> The moroccan black soap is gentle and leaves my skin feeling soft.  Love it! I&#x27;ve had good experiences with this manufacturer and would order from them again.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It does exactly as described. The key is to make sure you soak in a hot bath for about 10-15 min before using the soap. Also, get the Kessa Hammam exfoliating glove. This really helps exfoliate and smooth out the skin! If used correctly, you will notice the removal of dead skin off your body and you will be left feeling silky smooth for days! I highly recommend this soap. It&#x27;s a great price and is definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Product is more of a mask than soap. leaves skin glowing.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this soap! I leave it on for 5 or more minutes depending on how much time I have then I use the moroccan exfoliating glove or magic peeling glove to exfoliate. Then I am both horrified and absolutely please with the results. If you want to exfoliate like they do at the Turkish bath houses I suggest you start with these products.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best exfoliating wash I have ever used. I am in my forties, and have noticed lately that my skin has become increasingly dry. About a year ago, I had read about the Baden mitten, which was receiving a lot of attention for its apparently amazing ability to exfoliate skin to baby smooth softness. I was intrigued- but the price gave me pause (almost $50.00 for an exfoliating mitt?) Luckily, around the time I had resolved to go ahead and shell out the money for the Baden mitten, I happened to see this product while browsing on Amazon&#x27;s website. It had pretty decent reviews, and the price was right, so I decided to try it first. After the first time bathing with this black soap, I was utterly amazed. I had expected something grainy-like most exfoliating washes, but the soap was soft and almost gooey. I used exfoliating gloves from the drugstore ($3) and the black soap to gently scrub off more dead skin than I ever dreamed I even had, It was a little gross, but let me tell you, my skin has not been this soft since high school. I now keep a steady supply of this stuff so that I never run out. The smell is not my favorite, but who cares? It is worth it to have such wonderfully soft skin again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 weeks and haven&#x27;t seen a difference...</li>
    <li> i just love this product it is wonderful.thank you for having it now available for all of us here in mexico</li>
