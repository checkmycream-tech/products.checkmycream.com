      <li>I didn&#x27;t love them!</li>
      <li>It does an ok job in removing makeup.</li>
      <li>Love this product -- but like the horizontal package better -- easier to carry with.</li>
      <li>It says it is for eye makeup as well as foundation, and I did use a product like this before, so I thought it would  be ok.  </li>
      <li>These wipes are just ok.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>Love these wipes.</li>
      <li>I tried them and fell in love with them immmediately.  </li>
      <li>should do a better job counting them.</li>
      <li>Our guest liked them very much.</li>
      <li>So I have purchased  La Fresh makeup wipes many times in the past….</li>
      <li>I think it is a good product for removing eye makeup, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to burn the skin near my eyes.  </li>
      <li>They were moist and not dried up but don&#x27;t seem to wipe my makeup off good at all.  </li>
      <li>Love the makeup remove r wipes..leaves your face clean and fresh without drying out..</li>
      <li>Quickly and easily removes makeup-especially eye liner and mascara.</li>
      <li>For the price, these wipes are nothing special.</li>
      <li>I will purchase La Fresh again but NEVER in this quantity or type of sale, I will go to the original web site.</li>
      <li>Nice for traveling, since they are individually wrapped.</li>
      <li>I used these for the first time in a hotel and loved them, however, the product I received was not nearly as moist as those in the hotel.</li>
      <li>So I use it anyway, because it does a good job, but then I immediately wipe around my eyes again with a wet wash cloth.  </li>
      <li>The ones in the hotel wipe it right off.</li>
      <li>Love these wipes!thiswas my second order.</li>
      <li>They do exactly what they advertise</li>
      <li>These wipes are great for travel because they are individually packaged - they are gentle enough for children to  use</li>
      <li>The first time I used these they were provided in a hotel.</li>
      <li>Not expensive.</li>
      <li>Seller was great and the package arrived earlier than expected.  </li>
      <li>I love this product because the wipes are individualy wrapped and in that way they don&#x27;t dry out.</li>
      <li>Works very wel.</li>
      <li>These work very well.</li>
      <li>They appreciated us having them.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>They have a clean smell and do not leave  my face dry or oily.</li>
      <li>Love these for travel, and I always keep a few in my handbag they double as hand wipes in a pinch as well.</li>
      <li>and they were not nearly as moist and soft as the others even though they were the same brand.</li>
      <li>Definitely does not dry your skin out.</li>

<li> This product burns and is not nearly as good of quality as the other La Fresh wipes I have purchased.  </li>
<li> I reduced by 1 star because they are a little more expensive than I would like</li>
<li> However, the towelettes were only half the size of the ones I had used at a hotel I stayed in</li>
<li> I use black eye liner with black mascara.</li>
<li> no more w orring about cleaning  makeup from wash cloths</li>
<li> BUT not in this case of 200-&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if this is a knock off or just inferior ingredients  ???  </li>
<li> You don&#x27;t have to wipe hard to get everything off either.</li>
<li> If you aren&#x27;t as apparently delicate as I am, you will like this product.</li>

    <li> This is the only makeup remover that my daughter will use.  So that makes it great in my eyes!</li>
    <li> My wife loves them - no complaints</li>
    <li> This is a mixed review.  I think it is a good product for removing eye makeup, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to burn the skin near my eyes.  It says it is for eye makeup as well as foundation, and I did use a product like this before, so I thought it would  be ok.  So I use it anyway, because it does a good job, but then I immediately wipe around my eyes again with a wet wash cloth.  If you aren&#x27;t as apparently delicate as I am, you will like this product.</li>
    <li> Our guest liked them very much. They appreciated us having them.</li>
    <li> These wipes are just ok. For the price, these wipes are nothing special. It does an ok job in removing makeup. Nice for traveling, since they are individually wrapped.</li>
    <li> These are awesome! So great to have on hand for purse, vacation, freshening up, etc. I&#x27;ll be purchasing more soon!</li>
    <li> These wipes are great for travel because they are individually packaged - they are gentle enough for children to  use</li>
    <li> I travel a lot for work and some of the hotel chains provided these wipes.  I tried them and fell in love with them immmediately.  I jumped on line to find them and I ordered a case of them.  I&#x27;ve tried numerouse brands of makeup removing wipes but none of them work as well as these.  I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> My wife LOVES these and swears by them.</li>
    <li> Love the makeup remove r wipes..leaves your face clean and fresh without drying out..no more w orring about cleaning  makeup from wash cloths</li>
    <li> COUNT NOT SURVIVE WITHOUT THESE. Found these at a hotel several years ago and will never go back. Smells great but does not leave the sticky residue on your face. LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
    <li> Love these wipes. I reduced by 1 star because they are a little more expensive than I would like</li>
    <li> I love this product because the wipes are individualy wrapped and in that way they don&#x27;t dry out.</li>
    <li> Great Product! The first time I used these they were provided in a hotel. I had forgotten my face cleanser.  Quickly and easily removes makeup-especially eye liner and mascara. Definitely does not dry your skin out. These are convenient as they are individually wrapped which keeps them moist until you need them. I&#x27;ll definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> Love these wipes!thiswas my second order.</li>
    <li> Love these for travel, and I always keep a few in my handbag they double as hand wipes in a pinch as well.</li>
    <li> Works very wel. Not expensive. Good find.</li>
    <li> I like these, but definitely prefer the lavender ones by the same company.</li>
    <li> These Makeup Removers do the job. They have a clean smell and do not leave  my face dry or oily.</li>
    <li> These work very well.</li>
    <li> I use black eye liner with black mascara. Nornally, it takes 2/3 baby wipes to get evething off. It only took me using one of these. You don&#x27;t have to wipe hard to get everything off either. I will continue to use these.</li>
    <li> I used these for the first time in a hotel and loved them, however, the product I received was not nearly as moist as those in the hotel.</li>
    <li> Seller was great and the package arrived earlier than expected.  However, the towelettes were only half the size of the ones I had used at a hotel I stayed in and they were not nearly as moist and soft as the others even though they were the same brand. These ones also seemed to sting my face and eyes a bit.  I suggest buying the larger ones in the rectangle-shaped envelopes.</li>
    <li> Love these ! They do exactly what they advertise</li>
    <li> So I have purchased  La Fresh makeup wipes many times in the past…. BUT not in this case of 200-&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if this is a knock off or just inferior ingredients  ???

    <li> my wife loves these wipes, she is very glad she purchased them, but again the company sending them out should do a better job counting them. we ordered 200 but received 194.</li>
    <li> My wife loves them, great for our rv.</li>
    <li> Love this product -- but like the horizontal package better -- easier to carry with.</li>
    <li> Second time ordering LaFresh makeup remover wipes...love them!!</li>
    <li> These weren&#x27;t as good as ones in hotel.  They were moist and not dried up but don&#x27;t seem to wipe my makeup off good at all.  The ones in the hotel wipe it right off. I didn&#x27;t love them!</li>
