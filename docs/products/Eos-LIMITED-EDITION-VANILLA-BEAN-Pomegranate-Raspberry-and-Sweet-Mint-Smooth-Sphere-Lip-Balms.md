      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>I know, nice friend</li>
      <li>a friend told me about these EOS lip balms I didn&#x27;t think they could be as good or better than Sugar.</li>
      <li>I really liked all three flavor/scent varieties.</li>
      <li>Nice packaging</li>
      <li>They are very naturaly and delicious.</li>
      <li>When we were at a store together, I saw this and asked why she liked the product.</li>
      <li>lip balms themselves weren&#x27;t wrapped but I had to make sure that they were untouched before I gifted them to my friend, to avoid embarrassment if she opened them to realize that the lip balms had been used before!</li>
      <li>Ordering was easy, arrived as described and our daughter loves, loves, loves the flavors!</li>
      <li>all three flavors were amazing girlfriend loved them vanilla bean was tricky to find but worth  it</li>
      <li>My daughters (both adults) love Eos lipbalm.  </li>
      <li>My daughters absolutely love this lip gloss.  </li>
      <li>It came in a cute package and ther is one for each mmeber of her family.</li>
      <li>The peppermint is definitely my favorite.</li>
      <li>I love them</li>
      <li>My husband likes that the flavors are not at all overwhelming.</li>
      <li>an try the vanilla bean love</li>
      <li>I loved it so much that I returned the favor and bought it for another friend to try when she asked me how I liked</li>
      <li>so when I found this on Amazon for a lower price, I was glad to buy</li>
      <li>Very excited come in a holiday theme for christmas plus aswome eos flavors.</li>
      <li>For years I used Sugar Lip Treatment by FRESH, which is amazing</li>
      <li>The vanilla lip balm smells rather cheaply made, more so a manufactured science lab aroma to it.</li>
      <li>The sphere makes it easy to apply to both lips at one time.</li>
      <li>vanilla and raspberry ones are very nice as well, and I definitely don&#x27;t mind using them, I just really love the peppermint.</li>
      <li>before you go to bed at night, no cracks just smooth lips.</li>
      <li>My lips feel really smooth and moisturized after each application - not waxy or sticky.</li>
      <li>I loved the flavors and the balm itself makes my lips so soft my lipstick glides on</li>
      <li>As much as I loved it my husband did not like the citrus scent or taste of it, regardless of how soft it made my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;medicated&amp;#34; part of the sweet mint.</li>
      <li>It is slightly cooling and pepperminty, in a nice refreshing way that isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I excitedly opened the mail package and my smile immediately faded when I saw that the stickers holding the seal of the product was already lifted and had fingerprint marks on it.</li>
      <li>Particularly loved the limited edition Vanilla.  </li>
      <li>And for some reason the sweet mint makes my lips feel more chapped rather than better as they do with the other flavors.</li>
      <li>right?</li>
      <li>but if I toss it in a bag or purse the spherical shape makes it very easy to find without actually looking for it.</li>
      <li>I really wanted a new one and love the one I&#x27;ve been using</li>
      <li>This package was very reasonably priced and was a hit in their stockings.</li>
      <li>This lip balm has many beneficial ingredients like jojoba oil, shea butter, and vitamin E - which are specific ingredients I look for in all my body lotions.</li>
      <li>Definitely purchasing more when this gift pack runs out.</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I was looking for</li>
      <li>I shared with my neighbor and now she is an avid user.</li>
      <li>I actually have them this way: peppermint in my purse because I use it most often there</li>
      <li>The vanilla flavor isn&#x27;t worth buying the whole set just to try it out.</li>
      <li>It helps with dry cracked lips in the winter and is really smooth!</li>
      <li>Really?</li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell real.</li>
      <li>Way to much for chapstick</li>
      <li>Go ahead make your profit, but keep price reasonable.</li>
      <li>I am not a person to wear lipsticks or glosses but when my lips became dry and chapped I searched high and low for a good lip balm.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>EOS limited vanilla bean was well worth the wait!</li>
      <li>I also can&#x27;t report on what they taste like, which must mean the taste is similarly light/ pleasant</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s enough of a scent where you can smell it, but it doesn&#x27;t really register much.</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to smells</li>
      <li>This stuff really works, my lips really get dry and cracked, put this on during the day and</li>
      <li>I like that they are 100% natural, USDA-certified organic</li>
      <li>It brought a smile to a 14 year old&#x27;s face and was worth the few extra dollars as it was on her wish list (I found it to be sold out everywhere else).  </li>
      <li>I really like it, but for the price I think it&#x27;s a little much.</li>
      <li>I live in Colorado where it is so dry in the winter.  </li>
      <li>got this to give as a present for a young teen.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I found this sent in a Target store last year (2013) it was a good price so my mother-in-law and I decided to give it a try. I hate chapstick  or blistex, I ALWAYS loose them and they never do the job for me. Of the set I chose the vanilla one... I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year (still some left) and I love it! It helps with dry cracked lips in the winter and is really smooth! I really like it, but for the price I think it&#x27;s a little much. I&#x27;m sad that the vanilla only comes in a set or a stick... I really wanted a new one and love the one I&#x27;ve been using but I guess I&#x27;ll have to try a different flavor.</li>
    <li> my tweens love this stuff! For me it&#x27;s a great product, but i&#x27;d rather have a stick, more convenient to put in pocket or purse</li>
    <li> I loved the flavors and the balm itself makes my lips so soft my lipstick glides on I shared with my neighbor and now she is an avid user.</li>
    <li> My daughters absolutely love this lip gloss.  I gave it to them for Christmas.  They are wanting me to get more soon!</li>
    <li> The vanilla lip balm smells rather cheaply made, more so a manufactured science lab aroma to it. Doesn&#x27;t smell real.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was looking for and I love this balm! It made the perfect gift and the ornament container is so cute!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves all the different flavors and colors. I love the lip protection; it is a win-win situation for us!</li>
    <li> Way to much for chapstick</li>
    <li> I loved this lip balm and I will not use anything else that is how great I feel about this stuff. And I got my daughter to use it as well and she loves it too.</li>
    <li> This was a great stocking stuffer for my daughter. It came in a cute package and ther is one for each mmeber of her family.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good to know to use a lip product that is safer to ingest when drinking or eating.  Natural ingredients are the way to go than other chemicals and parabens that are harmful.  The sphere makes it easy to apply to both lips at one time.</li>
    <li> While it was cheaper at Target after Christmas, this product was a smash in the Christmas Stocking!  Particularly loved the limited edition Vanilla.  It brought a smile to a 14 year old&#x27;s face and was worth the few extra dollars as it was on her wish list (I found it to be sold out everywhere else).  Can always rely on Amazon to have what i&#x27;m looking for and to save the day</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this pack of EOS.  She loves the Vanilla.  Very happy with this purchase.  We love EOS!! Happy with it!</li>
    <li> all three flavors were amazing girlfriend loved them vanilla bean was tricky to find but worth  it</li>
    <li> While I love this product, I was frustrated that the packaging was beat up when I received the item.  Frustrating because the item is a gift.</li>
    <li> I am not a person to wear lipsticks or glosses but when my lips became dry and chapped I searched high and low for a good lip balm. I am quite impressed with these spheres. For years I used Sugar Lip Treatment by FRESH, which is amazing but it can be really hard to find and it&#x27;s expensive - but it works wonders! As much as I loved it my husband did not like the citrus scent or taste of it, regardless of how soft it made my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a friend told me about these EOS lip balms I didn&#x27;t think they could be as good or better than Sugar. Was I ever wrong! These little spheres are A.W.E.S.O.M.E.!!!  The little sphere took me awhile to get used to because it can feel bulky in a pocket but if I toss it in a bag or purse the spherical shape makes it very easy to find without actually looking for it. I also like the sphere because I don&#x27;t have to worry about digging the balm out of a tube when it&#x27;s running low and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it melting in a tube either. My lips feel really smooth and moisturized after each application - not waxy or sticky. This lip balm has many beneficial ingredients like jojoba oil, shea butter, and vitamin E - which are specific ingredients I look for in all my body lotions. My husband likes that the flavors are not at all overwhelming. I like that they are 100% natural, USDA-certified organic, they are petrolatum and paraben-free, the packaging is recyclable, and EOS does not test any products on animals.</li>
    <li> I bought this gift for a close friend of mine but the overall condition of the product made me iffy about buying from the seller again. I know typically Eos products are expensive in CVS/Walgreens stores so when I found this on Amazon for a lower price, I was glad to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I excitedly opened the mail package and my smile immediately faded when I saw that the stickers holding the seal of the product was already lifted and had fingerprint marks on it. I was very unhappy and the plastic anterior of the product was also scratched up/faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip balms themselves weren&#x27;t wrapped but I had to make sure that they were untouched before I gifted them to my friend, to avoid embarrassment if she opened them to realize that the lip balms had been used before! So I felt really weird opening up the lip balms, but I had to check out of necessity. They turned out fine, they were untouched and also smelled awesome (the raspberry, mint, and vanilla).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was just the exterior plastic/paper packaging that made me annoyed so I will just gift the Eos lip balms without the plastic container.</li>
    <li> They are very nice. I like them. They are very naturaly and delicious. Also, they are very good. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Great item. Shipped in good condition.  No problems at all, thank you. And that&#x27;s all I have to say about that</li>
    <li> The vanilla flavor isn&#x27;t worth buying the whole set just to try it out. And for some reason the sweet mint makes my lips feel more chapped rather than better as they do with the other flavors. I think it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;medicated&amp;#34; part of the sweet mint.</li>
    <li> GREAT buy. Love the Vanilla ! Had to buy another for my daughter</li>
    <li> got this to give as a present for a young teen.  she loves the way they smell and collects them all.</li>
    <li> I just ordered this for my sister for christmas. Very excited come in a holiday theme for christmas plus aswome eos flavors. Deff think this will.be a hit. I have the sorbe one an mint one an I love them deff need to order few for me an try the vanilla bean love the smells an they work great for chaped lips</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this order..my granddaughter only needed the white one to have them all so she is very happy</li>
    <li> My daughters (both adults) love Eos lipbalm.  This package was very reasonably priced and was a hit in their stockings.</li>
    <li> Seriously $70 for a lip balm. I can&#x27;t understand why people price gouge over a limited edition product. Go ahead make your profit, but keep price reasonable. Anyone who buys this at this price is stupid! I wish there was a law to limit maximum sales prices, this is beyond ridiculous, it makes me sick!</li>
    <li> EOS limited vanilla bean was well worth the wait! Ordering was easy, arrived as described and our daughter loves, loves, loves the flavors!</li>
    <li> I had heard about this product through magazines, I saw it on your web site and decided to get it.  This stuff really works, my lips really get dry and cracked, put this on during the day and before you go to bed at night, no cracks just smooth lips.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm ever.  I live in Colorado where it is so dry in the winter.  Since using this lip balm my lips still think it&#x27;s summer.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Zero stars!!!!  I hope there is a typo in this price. I am shocked. The pomegranate and the mint ones you can buy in the store. So, you are spending over $6o on a lip balm. Really?</li>
    <li> Nice packaging it can makes a good gifts</li>
    <li> The vanilla one isn&#x27;t the right flavor don&#x27;t waste ur money !!!</li>
    <li> My friend was always using the EOS peppermint lip balms. When we were at a store together, I saw this and asked why she liked the product. Without me knowing, she bought me this gift set so I could try it myself! I know, nice friend right? I really liked all three flavor/scent varieties. The peppermint is definitely my favorite. It is slightly cooling and pepperminty, in a nice refreshing way that isn&#x27;t too strong. I loved it so much that I returned the favor and bought it for another friend to try when she asked me how I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vanilla and raspberry ones are very nice as well, and I definitely don&#x27;t mind using them, I just really love the peppermint. I actually have them this way: peppermint in my purse because I use it most often there (I always seem to notice my lips feel really dry after walking around the city, especially when it&#x27;s windy or cold out), vanilla in my bathroom drawer so that I can use it every morning as part of my beauty routine (don&#x27;t want chapped lips under lipstick), and raspberry in my car (don&#x27;t leave these in your car in the summer though! they do melt, I unfortunately learned).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, these flavors are all wonderful. I am very sensitive to smells and I actually really hate the smell of vanilla, but the scents are just so light that I actually enjoy the vanilla scent. It&#x27;s enough of a scent where you can smell it, but it doesn&#x27;t really register much. I also can&#x27;t report on what they taste like, which must mean the taste is similarly light/ pleasant otherwise I would have been greatly turned off of them by now. Definitely purchasing more when this gift pack runs out. Oh, speaking of which! My friend bought this for me in January and they are still holding up in July!</li>
