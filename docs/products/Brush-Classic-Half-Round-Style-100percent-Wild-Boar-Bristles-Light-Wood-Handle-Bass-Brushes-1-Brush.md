<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was so excited to find this brush!  I&#x27;ve been without the right hair brush for over a year and was rather surprised just how hard it is to find a 100% boar bristle brush in a half round shape.  The brush arrived quickly, works great and is comfortable to grip.  Here&#x27;s where they lost a star  (and a half if that were possible--3.5)...the bristles fall out.  One bristle pore was completely empty upon arrival and another had only 2 or 3 bristles in it.  However, all the rest seemed fine, and the brush works fine, so no big.  Then today i cleaned some hair out of the brush and several more bristles came out with the hair.  It still works fine, and the difference is not noticeable in use, but the brush just came Saturday and today is Monday, so we&#x27;ll see.  The brush I lost a a year ago had never lost a bristle in all the many years I had it.  Still an all, I&#x27;m really excited about my brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing--there are 4 small brass screws on the back of the brush.  This is not noted anywhere in the description or photo&#x27;s, so know that this may set off metal detectors if you spend a lot of time in an airport or government building.  Not sure if this has anything to do with holding the bristles in...my last brush was BASS also, and did not have this.</li>
    <li> Brush could be larger with more bristles for those of us with long and/or thick hair.  Seems this brush would be best for travel, or for children.</li>
    <li> Mine is not quite as pictured (the wood is striped on mine).&lt;br /&gt;Bass is a very nice brand and I think mine will work out&lt;br /&gt;just fine, though I am a little concerned about the screw on&lt;br /&gt;the back side of the brush.</li>
    <li> Stiff, but really brushes hair well</li>
    <li> The BRUSH was just what I was looking for....I am very satisfied. I had one for several years that I finally had to put in the trash....LOL!</li>
    <li> Many years ago, I owned a Kent brush with boar bristles and really liked it.  it got lost along the way, and since then I have been using synthetic brushes.  I decided it was time to give another boar bristle brush a try, but the Kent ones are so expensive!  So I decided to give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is of lesser quality than the Kent brush, in terms of the handle.  The lacquer on it seems pretty cheap to me, and the metal screws on the back of the brush are noticeable and look cheap.  The quality of the boar bristles seems good though, and the bristles seem to be attached firmly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is short and so the length of the bristles (medium length) was fine for me.  Just after using the brush a few times, my hair seems to be much smoother and better behaved.  I can see why women used to feel that brushing their hair 100 times a night with this kind of brush would be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If money were no object, a Kent would be a nicer brush.  But in terms of performance, this one seems just as good as the Kent, making it a good deal.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush! Bought it for my auntie and she loves it!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Good, sturdy product, gentle on the hair, arrived promptly, as advertised.</li>
    <li> a nice quality brush, probably will be a great groomer for most folks, but - I have very thick hair, and this just does not penetrate down to the scalp for me (sigh - I will have to keep looking)</li>
    <li> Good brush for your hair.</li>
    <li> Love this brush so much it&#x27;s insane. Makes my hair more silky &amp; moisturize. So if u a black girls like me and u are looking for a great brush go ahead and pull the trigger.</li>
    <li> Great hair brush, and nice quality. Definitely makes your hair look more voluminous.</li>
    <li> The 100% wild boar hair Bass brush bristles help stimulate the scalp for more blood flow hopefully to prevent hair loss. It makes my hair to have more body and shine when I flip my hair over to brush it a few times a day. The wood handle is nice and the half round brush is perfect. The length of the wild boar hair bristles is suffice for people with thinner hair; however the wild boar hair bristles are too short for people with thick hair which the brush bristles don&#x27;t touch the scalp for stimulation. This is why it is rated 4. It also costs more than Sprouts Farmer Market.</li>
    <li> My hair has slowly been becoming brittle, through unintentional neglect. Not that I hadn&#x27;t tried--bought boo-coo posh hair products from my hair salon that specializes in high end stuff that supports wind power, &#x27;green&#x27; etc. Hair dresser kept telling me my hair was dry, brittle. What gives? I&#x27;d sunk a fortune in her products????&lt;br /&gt;So, I decided to take things into my own hands and go back to the basics. Shampoo less often (2 times a week) using sulfate free shampoo from Aveeno (Walgreens), conditioner from hair salon (&amp;#34;Dry Remedy&amp;#34;), minimal product to keep style in shape, and regular brushing with a &#x27;wild boar bristle brush&#x27;. hence this brush. My self designed plan is working--my hair is softer, shinier, much less brittle. All in all, I&#x27;m spending a fraction on my hair with this pretty basic, low profile plan. Glad for the investment in an old fashioned basic.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted, Fine quality--great price.</li>
    <li> This brush feels awesome on your scalp.  Does a nice job of brushing without any static.</li>
    <li> I love this brush for my fine hair.  It is stiff enough and picks my hair up nicely when styling.  I recommend this brush for fine hair like mine which is not thin.  I may order another</li>
    <li> great brush for the price, a little larger than i thought.  A great replacement for a 30 yr old brush i paid 3 times the amount for back in the day.</li>
    <li> This brush couldn&#x27;t grip my hair very well.  (I have a LOT of hair)</li>
    <li> This is possibly the best brush I have used for my daughter&#x27;s hair! She has a ton of soft but very curly hair. I have no trouble brushing through it  with this brush. The boar bristles don&#x27;t poke me (or her) yet it still detangles to the scalp. Well, eventually - those of you with curly hair know how it is! It is a nice, sturdy, well-made brush. I&#x27;ve easily paid more than twice the price for brushes only half as good.</li>
    <li> I have fine, chin-length hair. This replaced a brush I&#x27;d used for 20 years or so, a tall order. I have been really pleased with the quality and styling properties of this brush. A great deal for the price and very nice looking. Not very static-y once it gets some use. I bought two brushes at the same time, and this was the clear winner because it&#x27;s easy to style with.</li>
    <li> Love this brush for my daughter&#x27;s thin hair. It smooths out her easily snarled hair and leaves her hair shiny and soft. It can be a bit painful for my daughter if I press too hard.  It doesn&#x27;t work the best with my thicker hair...I have to push harder to try to get it to reach my scalp. Still is a good brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my 7 year old son. He likes the brush and it&#x27;s just as advertised, however I would have liked something a bit more gentle, maybe softer bristles. I would def buy this for an older kid or an adult!</li>
    <li> The brush I received had a crack in the wood which ran thru a couple of the bristle plugs.  Bristles fell out when I ran my fingers across them.  The crack was quite easy to see, so if that is the level of quality control the company finds adequate, I&#x27;ll look elsewhere.  Also, there were screws on the backside of the brush.  I have no idea why screws were needed there, my old half round didn&#x27;t have anything on the backside, just smooth wood.  They were not completely flush with the surface of the wood, and if I&#x27;d had a mind to try the brush, I feel sure hair would&#x27;ve gotten snagged on those screws.  Really horrible quality.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> This is the nicest hairbrush I own! The bristles are not too hard, which was the case with one of my other boar bristle brushes. They&#x27;re also not too soft, so you can actually brush your hair. Great brush, great deal!</li>
    <li> I did not like this brush.  I have short hair and the bristles don&#x27;t go through your hair or to your scalp but just over the top surface of your hair.  Maybe the bristles are too short and too soft.</li>
    <li> great brush i actually bought it for my border collie after he runs he loves it cleans his fur without being to corse but also not to soft where it won&#x27;t penetrate the coat love it,</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful brush and has replaced any other brush that I use.  I use it to brush my hair when dry, when wet, AND for styling with a blow-dryer.  For context, I have fine, straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are gentle on my scalp and hair.  Sometimes I brush my hair when I don&#x27;t actually need to, but because brushing my hair with this thing just feels so dang good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for several months now and the brush is proving to be high quality.  Still looks brand new.  Haven&#x27;t lost any bristles or experienced any wear on the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Please note that the initial static electricity will eventually go away!**  I almost returned the brush because it made my hair static-y at first, but after a week or two of use that issue went a way.  I&#x27;m pretty sure I read another review noting the same experience.  Regardless, I&#x27;m glad I kept the brush because it was a very well-spent $12.</li>
    <li> Broke after one use. Bristles fall out all the time.</li>
    <li> very nice,is it made in Germany or china?.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift and received nothing but praises on how great this brush is.</li>
    <li> great quality. i have thin wavey hair. i bought it to use to straighten with a blow dryer. i find it doesn&#x27;t work well for that purpose but nice for brushing my hair after it is dry and straightened.</li>
    <li> Handle comfortable and brissels just right. Not too stiff or overly soft. Very good brush for the money. Delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these brushes and so glad I did since I have one in our RV also. Feels so wonderful on my head when brushing. I highly recommend these brushes and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out like some brushes. I highly recommend trying this brush</li>
    <li> After only a month the bristles have started falling out.</li>
    <li> Whole family loves it</li>
    <li> My son-in-law uses this as a beard brush and likes it.</li>
    <li> The brush is well made and as I expected. The wooden handle is nicely shaped the bristles are a little softer than I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent brush and would recommend it.  My wife says it is great for removing tangles. One problem--when you first wash it, it smells like a wet dog. That&#x27;s just proof it is real boar bristles (I guess everyone is used to plastic).</li>
    <li> It came just as described and I have thin hair and never used a brush like this before.  Now that I am using it, I am really impressed.  Just right for the scalp as it does not scratch.</li>
    <li> I like the brush but the quality is okay. I used it about 6 times after showering and some bristles have already fallen out, now I use my plastic brush and finish with this one. It&#x27;s good for adding volume and styling but overall daily brushing it isn&#x27;t quite up for the job especially with thick hair.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist advised me to procure a boar bristle brush with soft bristles to help work oils through my hair (fine, straight, slightly oily) without irritating my scalp.  This one does the trick!</li>
    <li> Nice product.  Arrived on time and so far is better than I expected.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush.  It messages the scalp and is strong enough to brush out hair nicely.</li>
    <li> Met all expectations and isa good value for the money.</li>
    <li> The bristles were not attached in a neat row. some bent, laying flat against the base handle. My old one looks cleaner (not as in dirty) but bristles are more carefully set. My old one just wore out at the top end after 20+years.</li>
    <li> STURDY BRUSH.  GREAT FOR FINE HAIR.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have known better.  This is not intended for natural wavy or curly hair.  It now sits in it&#x27;s box, tags still attached.</li>
    <li> I have long used a boar brush for its ease on hair as opposed to a brush with nylon bristles. So I ordered this brush based on the reviews and price. The package was sent in a very timely manner and well packed, however, the brush as defective as it was missing a &amp;#34;plug&amp;#34; of bristles. See photos. It was too much trouble to return/exchange the brush so I am keeping it but I post this review and pics so others may be aware. Other than that, it&#x27;s a nice brush, well priced and easy to hold. Recommend for thin or short hair only as bristles are not stiff.</li>
    <li> Nice and well made! Easy to clean and know I will be keeping this brush around for a long time:-)</li>
    <li> I like this brush!  It&#x27;s different than what I&#x27;m used to (i used this one plastic comb all my life), but for a brush (not a comb), i like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty thin and straight longish asian hair (comes down to my boobs).  I started looking into boar/natural bristle brushes because supposedly they&#x27;re better for my hair.  i don&#x27;t really need the full round brushes (I don&#x27;t really use the blow dryer), and i don&#x27;t particularly like the large paddle brushes, so I went ahead and settled on this since it&#x27;s reasonably priced, good review, and not too large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle/overall construction is lovely.  The bristles did shed some (maybe around 5 strands so far) but nothing came out in clumps or anything.  The bristles are kinda sharp at the tip (my plastic comb is more rounded), but i read that the boar bristles helps to carry the natural oil from my scalp down the hair length so i can see how there are so many bristles and how the not nearly so rounded tips are more likely to carry the natural oil.  The bristles, with so many of them, felt kinda like a massage too which is always nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the bristles are pretty stiff, but maybe it&#x27;s because there are a lot of bristles but i have trouble carrying it completely through my hair.  At the scalp it brushes through no problem, but once you get to mid back of my head to down, it feels like if there&#x27;s no equal pressure on the other side of the hair, the bristles can&#x27;t seem to actually slide THROUGH my hair, only on the top layer.  to fix that, I typically use my other hand to brace against my hair so that the brush actually brush through.  It&#x27;s more effort than my comb, but it&#x27;s not that bad, and I kinda like knowing that my hair is being properly brushed and separated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supposedly the idea of using natural bristles is to prevent flyaway and statics, but i noticed that if I use this brush while my hair is dry, it still poofs my hair out some from static.  but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair actually stick to my arm or clothes, it just poofs out some then it settles.  I didn&#x27;t notice any less flyaways to be honest, so i really can&#x27;t say if this is better than my older comb or not, but I do like to use this.  Plus it&#x27;s just a really pretty brush!  I definitely like this way more than the plastic paddle brushes I bought before and then never used.tick to my arm or clothes, it just poofs out some then it settles.

    <li> My wife loves this brush. Will probably get another one.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect brush. It is extremely well made, very nice to hold, and great for short or long hair.</li>
    <li> I was really happy to find this brush to replace a really old brush I keep using because I can&#x27;t find anything to replace it. The bristles of this brush are just the right firmness and I like a half round brush and natural bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with the first swipe of this brush in my hair, my hair became full of static, sticking straight out to the side. I tried more swipes thinking maybe the brush needed to release some electricity, but it kept happening. Went back to my old brush for about a week, no static. Tried the Bass again, major static.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched the web for a cure and all the solutions assume the problem is with the person&#x27;s hair (too dry) or the hair products (need to change shampoo). Well I don&#x27;t have a problem using my old brush and really have never had a problem, ever. Sure, occasionally in the winter under certain circumstances I get a little static, but never because of brushing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve got this brand new brush I can&#x27;t use (didn&#x27;t buy it here or I could have returned it, but I needed to feel the bristles before buying). If anyone has a cure--for the brush, not for my hair--I&#x27;d love to hear it.</li>
    <li> A truly Magnificent brush!, if there were 10 stars I&#x27;d give it an 11 !!</li>
    <li> Looks to be well made, stick as are other brushes but will soften a little over time with use.  Would suggest for future buyers just don&#x27;t be too heavy handed if your not used to natural bristle or boar hair bristles.</li>
    <li> Really great styling brush. It gets rid of frizz and tames the fly-aways and cowlicks. It also makes your hair look shiny (great if you gnerally have dry hair, or if you over-shampoo). Added bonus: it gets all the random pillow lint and dust out of my hair if I shower and sleep with wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT... If you have really oily hair (either from buildup from not showering for a few days, or you just naturally have an over-active scalp), and you&#x27;re thinking, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ll just use this brush to redistribute my scalp oil to the ends of my hair, and then I won&#x27;t look so greasy,&amp;#34; DO NOT use this brush! You will look like an oily mess LOL. This brush is great for moving oil around, but it&#x27;s no replacement for shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting side note: I ordered one for my partner after he tried and fell in love with mine, and although it was the same brush, the wooden (or bamboo?) handle was completely different colors. My brush was all kind of a honey brown shade, and his was alternating dark chocolate and pale beige strips. Both look cool but neither look like the one in the product listing photo.</li>
    <li> it is a wonderful brush  makes the hair smooth and shiny .</li>
    <li> I love this. it works well for me. I have long thin hair.</li>
    <li> Very nice brush with medium firm bristles. The handle is smooth and comfortable to hold. Nice product! Arrived quickly as well!</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  Feels great on my scalp, moves the oils through my hair and is all in all a quality brush.</li>
    <li> My 10 yr old son has had long hair since he was 6 &amp; has always complained loudly about having his hair brushed. It&#x27;s mostly very messy. Over the years I&#x27;ve tried many different types of brushes &amp; combs. This brush seems to work because of the soft bristles. It causes some static but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
    <li> The brush is spread out and not enough bore hair. You can tell by looking at the picture. The bamboo handle is nice and sturdy. It says it&#x27;s made of 100% wild boar hair. Over all, it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
    <li> The Bass Classic Half Round Brush is a very good brush. It arrived just as it was advertised. I would order this product again.</li>
    <li> Nice quality, however the bristles are maybe too hard.</li>
    <li> I had one of these when I was young and loved it.  Then I went to those plastic types and didn&#x27;t like them.  I love this brush.</li>
    <li> I used it for a few days but I didn&#x27;t see any changes or improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My regime was:&lt;br /&gt;1) Brush with a large tooth comb to detangle&lt;br /&gt;2) Brush with a regular hairbrush&lt;br /&gt;3) Use Boar Bristle brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background info:&lt;br /&gt;First off, I have thick hair (Every hairstylist comments on how much hair I have, so trust me when I say I have thick hair), secondly, my hair is coarse. My haircut is asymmetrical, so I have both long and short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the shorter side, this brush fared well, but on the longer side, I didn&#x27;t even penetrate to my scalp. Even so, brushing just the short side didn&#x27;t lead to any changes. I took off two stars because I was unsatisfied and because the bristles on the brush were already sort of splayed/frayed when it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this brush based on the reviews and even checked out the questions customers asked. I didn&#x27;t take the comments about it not working that well for long hair that seriously, but it&#x27;s actually true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have coarse, thick hair or you have long hair, I don&#x27;t recommend this brush for these reasons.</li>
    <li> My husband was very happy with the brush.  He uses it for his and his beard.  Likes the looks and feel of the handle and the bristles.</li>
    <li> This is a well made brush with very firm bristles. If you&#x27;re used to a conventional hairbrush you&#x27;ll have to learn to use this. I was frustrated at first because my hair is very dry at the ends and it felt like this brush was tugging at them. I just had to learn to brush very softly from the ends up.</li>
    <li> Imagine my surprise as I was looking for a natural bristle brish, finding my brush of choice from bygone days. AND from the trusted company of bygone days. I ordered it. Returning to a natural style of life, this does me well. Just as I remembered from my youth.  Thank you, Fuller and Bass.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair a bit frizzy.</li>
    <li> Not that I&#x27;m concerned so much with the looks of my hair brush, but I must admit this this one really looks good. It&#x27;s a bit bigger than I thought it would be, but that doesn&#x27;t distract from the looks or the performance. Though the bristles seem very stiff, they don&#x27;t feel rough on my scalp. To the contrary, the stiffness doesn&#x27;t seem to transfer such a feel... actually, just stiff enough and just soft enough to perform and feel just right. I&#x27;m totally satisfied!</li>
    <li> Very nice quality at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good condition and works beautifully for my hair (I have blonde hair on the thin/fine side and shoulder length). The half-round style is great for brushing near my scalp.</li>
    <li> Love this classic brush</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> After over five years of use, my old BASS brush was long overdue to be replaced, but money has been tight. Finally, was able to replace the brush, and even found the exact same one. Almost. The handle is the same quality, but there is less bristles per bunch, and they are spaced just a tiny bit further apart. Also, a dozen or so bristles came out when I cleaned my hair out of the brush after the first use. I&#x27;m hoping that doesn&#x27;t happen every time, otherwise, this replacement sure as hell isn&#x27;t going to last me 5 years like the last one did... :(</li>
    <li> Just love this brush!  unfortunately, my hair is getting thinner as I grow older, and I find that this brush seems to make my hair easier to manage and feel more lush!  To me it is not &amp;#34;just a rush&amp;#34;!  Works for me is all I can say.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush. It feels very nice on your scalp, and has a really nice solid feel to it. It is made of bamboo, so it doesn&#x27;t weigh very much. I love it, and also my cat jumped up on the counter and rubbed his face on it. His tail started twitching and puffed up. I had to hide it from him because he kept coming after it for more.</li>
    <li> I like this brush, but would not be able to use it exclusively.  It doesn&#x27;t do a very good job detangling my long, thick hair.  I like the smoothing aspect, and like to use it to finish off brushing my hair, but was a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this brush.</li>
    <li> Is what it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
    <li> The wrong brush for my head  -  it&#x27;s way too round and I could not tell.  There should be a better photo or a better description.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  Trying to replace an old brush, this one is better.  Very well made.</li>
    <li> This brush gets the job done in getting through think, tangled hair, with less effort. The natural bristles polish the hair and smooths quite nicely. Thank you for a quality product.</li>
    <li> I read that boar bristle brushes made your hair shinier and so i thought I&#x27;d give it a try based on product reviews.  For me, this brush did not work. i didnt like the way it brushed my hair and it caused a lot of static in my hair.  i did not like this brush at all.</li>
    <li> This brush is nearly perfect. My only complaint was a screw sticking out in the back that needed fixing. The bristles were firm just as I like them and the handle was easy to hold. I looked in many stores and tried many brushes but never could be happy about them until this one. It&#x27;s a good quality brush.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS HAIR BRUSH!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice brush but too large for my needs.</li>
    <li> it is great have thin hair and it is not to soft yet not hard as most I have tried.  Works very well for my hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for myself and my daughter ended up taking it!!! This brush feels great on the scalp and does a wonderful job.  I do agree that sectioning hair may help if your hair is long and thick but the quality of the brush stands out.</li>
    <li> Really, did not think that a particular type of bristle would make a difference, but boy, was I wrong.  I love the way this brush makes my hair feel so soft and look so much thicker.  Not sure how it works, as opposed to other brushes, but obviously, the boar bristles make all the difference.  My hair is shoulder-length, fine, not thick, but not thin, either.  However, after using this brush, my head looks like I have a ton of hair, and, my hair looks shinier, with less frizz.  In fact, I seldom need to use a curling iron now.  I don&#x27;t think this brush came with instructions but it should.  I actually learned about boar bristle brushes on the Moroccan Method website and a Youtube video on how to use the brush.  To use this brush correctly, a person leans over at the waist with your hair hanging down and then proceed to brush from the nape of the neck to the ends of the hair, but only brushing from the back of the head.  Do this for several strokes and then stand back up, lean over and do it again and then once again.  The video suggests doing this 2 or 3 times a day.  The back of the neck at the hair line is where the oil glands are located and as I brush, I can feel the oil pulling through my hair, only my hair doesn&#x27;t feel or look oily;It just feels healthier.  I remember my Grandma having a brush like this but I didn&#x27;t like it because I didn&#x27;t use it correctly. Sidenote:  I am also using a chemical-free shampoo on my hair, as well, which, I believe, is also making my hair and scalp healthier.</li>
    <li> Great quality.  Very happy with the brush.</li>
    <li> GREAT brush... Really makes a difference in how my hair looks and feels. I would recommend this to anyone who wants silkier and shinier hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> my husband love it so I let him have it!  Nice brush!</li>
    <li> I would have said I loved it, but the bristles are not as stiff as I would have liked.  The brush is, indeed, well made and the half round is easy to work with.</li>
    <li> Good brush for the money. I wanted a brush that would grab ahold of my hair and lift it. This brush did  the trick</li>
