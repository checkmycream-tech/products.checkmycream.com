      <li>Love the wax.</li>
      <li>I love this wax, it is stringy, but holds on to the hair and gets all of it out.</li>
      <li>This product needs a better description.  </li>
      <li>Also I had to make sure</li>
      <li>In soo many ways this is advantageous.</li>
      <li>Love this product..</li>
      <li>I needed to restock sp tried this one on a whim &amp; I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>I was beyond pleased.</li>

      <li>To be fair this was my first time doing home waxing</li>
      <li>The price was fair and overall I am very satisfied with this transaction.</li>
      <li>It has worked great so far.</li>
      <li>I have used other waxes and this has been the best.  </li>
      <li>to apply and easy to remove.</li>
      <li>but it is a really good product and highly recommended.</li>
      <li>If you haven&#x27;t waxed in a while, or want to wax for the very first time, go to a spa, DO NOT ATTEMPT at home...and don&#x27;t use this wax!</li>
      <li>I am a cosmetologist and I absolutely love this hard wax it is perfect!</li>
      <li>Prior to buying the Satin Smooth starter kit, I bought some of the sticky sugar and honey waxes that worked great on finer hairs but not the coarser hairs.</li>
      <li>the name says it all smooth.</li>
      <li>Easy clean up.</li>
      <li>satin smooth</li>
      <li>I was more excited about ordering this product until I used it for the first time.</li>
      <li>Not a bad wax</li>
      <li>To start, I have used other Satin Smooth waxes where I am very happy (i.e. the zinc oxide soft wax).</li>
      <li>If you love wild cherry and you need to wax your tongue as I do then buy this junk ASAP you will not regret it!</li>
      <li>Also the temperature for this wax was much more sensitive than the others</li>
      <li>It does a better job of removing the hair as compared to soft wax</li>
      <li>and hard wax IS AS GOOD as they describe it!</li>
      <li>This Satin Smooth hard wax is AMAZING!</li>
      <li>comes right off of everything and doesn&#x27;t have that wax feel</li>
      <li>I pulled it off at the exact right time or else</li>
      <li>I tried a few different waxes to see which one would be best for me this one I would not buy again</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this product for anyone that hates to shave and loves soft, smooth skin!</li>
      <li>Other than that..I Love it!</li>
      <li>but it works really well!</li>
      <li>I am an esthetician and love this wax for the upper lip, under arm and bikini area.</li>
      <li>I love this product, is very awesome for sensitive skins, and no strips needed so it more efficient than regular wax, less mess too!</li>
      <li>I truly am what Adam in the old testament would call a real woman however speaking of Adam today, if the wax is not as strong as this one he probably wouldn&#x27;t eat the apple</li>
      <li>Very efficient and quick for woman with fast hair growth, couldn&#x27;t maintain without this product as its a lot of work to keep that unwanted hair away.</li>
      <li>Easy to work with but not pick up hair well and hair grow back quicker than honey bee brand</li>
      <li>First, I got the most recommended Satin Smooth Calendula Gold hard wax for a while.  </li>
      <li>so if you are waxing certain areas that can be seen it will look read.</li>
      <li>Even though I have experienced occasional redness (I have very fair skin!), it is temporary and helps to apply pressure to the area for a few seconds afterwards to numb the sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;it is very creamy</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t harden too fast, which is a pain to get off... literally.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was very time consuming.</li>
      <li>Right cost, safely used multiple times on male genitalia with no ill effects, and in fact left things silky smooth &amp; soft for months.</li>
      <li>The warmer keeps the wax at a consistent temperature which avoids having to constantly reheat wax every 10 minutes which is a real time saver when large areas need to be waxed!</li>
      <li>The smell could use a little more work but it might be just because I dont like the smell of cherry.</li>
      <li>There are many hard waxes out there where I feel money and time are better spent.</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t harden very well leaving it soft and stretchy when pulling off of skin.</li>
      <li>Did not smell like cherry, I had to apply it kind of thick</li>
      <li>I have tried many hard waxes over the past year, and I was set on another kind.</li>
      <li>It attached only to the hair and left my skin feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>Great wax just don&#x27;t spread the wax too thin and don&#x27;t wait too long to pull it off</li>
      <li>I was new to using hard wax, I thought it would hurt more</li>
      <li>This Wild Cherry hard wax tastes way better than the competitors wild cherry flavor!</li>
      <li>far I have used the Wild Cherry Hard Wax and the Lavender Chamomile Wax and love the results.</li>
      <li>so try this wild cherry</li>
      <li>I will not purchase the &#x27;wild cherry&#x27; again</li>
      <li>It does take longer to heat and soften than soft wax</li>
      <li>works very well on personal parts.</li>
      <li>Using the microwave is so much easier/faster than placing it in a pan of hot water until it melts down.</li>
      <li>When it happened first I thought it was due to the irritation or regular hair removal aftershock where your skin feels a bit hot and reddish.  </li>
      <li>I ran out last month and was being lazy on ordering more.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get extermeley hot as the other hard wax I was using and removal was easy.</li>
      <li>it was much stickier did not do what I expected.</li>
      <li>Works ok, provided you apply it on thin.</li>
      <li>I have used at least 3 different types of Satin Smooth waxes and this one is my favorite.&lt;br</li>
      <li>First time waxing tip- take your time, it can be messy if you try to hurry.</li>
      <li>(not sure if I say the name right)</li>
      <li>hard wax with vitamin E is what i&#x27;d tell him  because its worth it if nothing else.</li>
      <li>Was looking for a new hard wax to try and this one had decent reviews.</li>
      <li>Essential to purchase quality heater, see one we purchased as this made the waxing much better, guy said was painful but much cleaner method than honey waxes</li>

<li> I tried soft wax before I tried hard wax and the hard wax wins in all areas.</li>
<li> Not a good option for first time waxing.</li>
<li> It takes forever to dry plus it hurts.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, Satin Smooth Wild Cherry takes a bit longer to harden and leaves pink color on my skin that lasts at least 2 days.   </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very bad it didn&#x27;t remove any hair.</li>
    <li> This is one of the worst waxes I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s very painful to use.The company makes great wax. Just not this one.</li>
    <li> Essential to purchase quality heater, see one we purchased as this made the waxing much better, guy said was painful but much cleaner method than honey waxes</li>
    <li> It arrived time efficiently. Only thing that concerned me was the wax was only sealed with the plastic lid, nothing to ensure wax was officially Satin Skin product. It has worked great so far.</li>
    <li> This product needs a better description.  I was not aware this was a stripless wax until it was too late. I made a terrible mess with this. It was very time consuming. It is definitely not for beginners.</li>
    <li> Not a good option for first time waxing. This will stick to hair and stay there until...well, I guess we&#x27;ll see.  I&#x27;ve tried this before when i waxed regularly but after months of not waxing using this made me nuts! If you haven&#x27;t waxed in a while, or want to wax for the very first time, go to a spa, DO NOT ATTEMPT at home...and don&#x27;t use this wax!</li>
    <li> I started waxing at home since 2007.  First, I got the most recommended Satin Smooth Calendula Gold hard wax for a while.  I figured I could step out of my comfort zone when I got confident on self-bikini waxing.  Unfortunately, Satin Smooth Wild Cherry takes a bit longer to harden and leaves pink color on my skin that lasts at least 2 days.   When it happened first I thought it was due to the irritation or regular hair removal aftershock where your skin feels a bit hot and reddish.  But the color stained into my skin and stayed there for a couple of days.  As soon as I finishe the 14oz cherry can, I never looked back.  For the same price, I would definitely go for Calendula.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> The wax is really bad, get&#x27;s cold extremely quick and doesn&#x27;t stick to the textile. For the face as recommended would be terrible.</li>
    <li> I am a cosmetologist and I absolutely love this hard wax it is perfect! Price was fair if purchased anywhere else I would have had to pay more! I will buy again!</li>
    <li> works very well on personal parts.</li>
    <li> Works ok, provided you apply it on thin. If you put the wax on too thick it hard to remove hair. One of the best waxes that satin smooth makes.</li>
    <li> I received a quality product in a very small amount of time. The price was fair and overall I am very satisfied with this transaction. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is the best wax for underarms.</li>
    <li> OMG! I LOOOOVE this stuff!! This Satin Smooth hard wax is AMAZING! and hard wax IS AS GOOD as they describe it! It ACTUALLY sticks to hair and NOT to the skin. In soo many ways this is advantageous. I tried soft wax before I tried hard wax and the hard wax wins in all areas. It does a better job of removing the hair as compared to soft wax, if some of the wax get on other parts of your skin when waxing, just let it harden first then remove it, it does not leave a sticky residue like soft wax, it is less messy, easier to use especially for home use.</li>
    <li> Easy to work with but not pick up hair well and hair grow back quicker than honey bee brand (not sure if I say the name right)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell very good, but it works great.</li>
    <li> this stuff is like gum. comes right off of everything and doesn&#x27;t have that wax feel but it works really well!</li>
    <li> I am an esthetician and love this wax for the upper lip, under arm and bikini area. Easy clean up. Use oil with it, not powder.</li>
    <li> Omg, this doesnt even remove hair. It takes forever to dry plus it hurts.</li>
    <li> I love this wax, it is stringy, but holds on to the hair and gets all of it out. can be used for both facial waxing and bikini. little messy which is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars</li>
    <li> This product works well. It was painful however. I have had pro-wax jobs done before and they were using a hard wax, not sure of brand but hurt much less. To be fair this was my first time doing home waxing and I may have been doing it wrong. None the less, it DID remove the hair. I was happy with the results. First time waxing tip- take your time, it can be messy if you try to hurry.</li>
    <li> Love this product..just wish it would come in a plastic container instead of a metal one so I can microwave it. Using the microwave is so much easier/faster than placing it in a pan of hot water until it melts down. Other than that..I Love it!</li>
    <li> This Wild Cherry hard wax tastes way better than the competitors wild cherry flavor! If you love wild cherry and you need to wax your tongue as I do then buy this junk ASAP you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> Was looking for a new hard wax to try and this one had decent reviews. The consistency of this wax is more like a cross between gum and silly putty even when trying it at various temperatures. It is also more painful than any other hard wax I have used. Not good for facial waxing or brazillians as skin lifting is very possible with this product.</li>
    <li> This product turned out to be. Nightmare.</li>
    <li> I was more excited about ordering this product until I used it for the first time. It leaves a pink stain on your skin after you&#x27;ve cleaned up. This wax also gets very messy with strings of wax going everywhere.... all over your face, hands, etc. It also doesn&#x27;t harden very well leaving it soft and stretchy when pulling off of skin. Overall it does pull the hair out, but I will not be ordering it again. I will stick to the GiGi Honey wax from now on. Side note- This wax smells like AutoZone.</li>
    <li> Best wax product ever</li>
    <li> Great wax just don&#x27;t spread the wax too thin and don&#x27;t wait too long to pull it off</li>
    <li> I have used at least 3 different types of Satin Smooth waxes and this one is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;it is very creamy so it does not crack/break when you are waxing off (which happens with the calendula one). It is great for bikini area and arm pits. It does not work that well for eyebrows and upper lip.</li>
    <li> this is the best wax I have used</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with hard wax that wasn&#x27;t in a salon and I LOVE it!!! I ran out last month and was being lazy on ordering more. So for the mean time I just went to a store and bought another type. Big mistake. It made me realize how well this one worked!!! Apparently not all hard waxes turn hard. Rest assured this one does and I won&#x27;t be buying any other brand.</li>
    <li> To start, I have used other Satin Smooth waxes where I am very happy (i.e. the zinc oxide soft wax). With the Wild cherry, I ended up being very disappointed. It is possible that I received a bad tin, but the cherry smell has a chemical overtone and is overpowering. The smell could be forgiven if the wax worked as a hard wax should. Even when using it over a small area like the fingers, the wax would crack and break apart during removal. There are many hard waxes out there where I feel money and time are better spent.</li>
    <li> I bought this wax a few years ago since I have coarse, fast-growing hair and I hate spending time in a salon. Prior to buying the Satin Smooth starter kit, I bought some of the sticky sugar and honey waxes that worked great on finer hairs but not the coarser hairs. The warmer keeps the wax at a consistent temperature which avoids having to constantly reheat wax every 10 minutes which is a real time saver when large areas need to be waxed! Even though I have experienced occasional redness (I have very fair skin!), it is temporary and helps to apply pressure to the area for a few seconds afterwards to numb the sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have used the Wild Cherry Hard Wax and the Lavender Chamomile Wax and love the results. Personally, I have noticed that the Lavender Wax left my skin softer than the Cherry Wax, but I prefer the hard wax since muslin strips aren&#x27;t required. Would highly recommend this product for anyone that hates to shave and loves soft, smooth skin!</li>
    <li> Did not smell like cherry, I had to apply it kind of thick or it would break apart. Applying thick uses more product than I&#x27;ve had to use with other cold wax brands. It did do a good job removing hair. Not a bad wax but I will continue to try other brands..</li>
    <li> I tried a few different waxes to see which one would be best for me this one I would not buy again it was much stickier did not do what I expected. Also the temperature for this wax was much more sensitive than the others so I burned myself a little if I wasn&#x27;t really careful. Also I had to make sure I pulled it off at the exact right time or else it wouldn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> I have been getting waxes for the past 4 years, the last year I&#x27;ve been doing myself. Yes, myself... it&#x27;s not that bad actually. I have tried many hard waxes over the past year, and I was set on another kind. I needed to restock sp tried this one on a whim &amp; I am so glad I did. It doesn&#x27;t get extermeley hot as the other hard wax I was using and removal was easy. It didn&#x27;t harden too fast, which is a pain to get off... literally.&lt;br /&gt;This is my go to wax now.</li>
    <li> my fav hard wax. great smell goes well with my wax pot easy clean up i will purchase this again</li>
    <li> Love this product, will keep buying. I already tried two flavors and both work well.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply and easy to remove.</li>
    <li> it does not work. does not come off stays on skin...</li>
    <li> I was new to using hard wax, I thought it would hurt more but this product proved me wrong. And there was not an area where I could not use it. It attached only to the hair and left my skin feeling smooth. The smell could use a little more work but it might be just because I dont like the smell of cherry.</li>
    <li> I have used other waxes and this has been the best.  It is better at removing difficult facial hair without irritating the skin.</li>
    <li> Love the wax. Hate the color.  I will not purchase the &#x27;wild cherry&#x27; again</li>
    <li> Right cost, safely used multiple times on male genitalia with no ill effects, and in fact left things silky smooth &amp; soft for months. Gonna stock up on!</li>
    <li> I truly am what Adam in the old testament would call a real woman however speaking of Adam today, if the wax is not as strong as this one he probably wouldn&#x27;t eat the apple so try this wild cherry satin smooth hard wax with vitamin E is what i&#x27;d tell him  because its worth it if nothing else.</li>
    <li> Not what i&#x27;m used to. it leaves red coloring behind. so if you are waxing certain areas that can be seen it will look read.</li>
    <li> I love this product, is very awesome for sensitive skins, and no strips needed so it more efficient than regular wax, less mess too!</li>
    <li> This a great product. It smells really good and clients love it. It does take longer to heat and soften than soft wax but it is a really good product and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> If you have to be self sufficient and wax on your own this is the wax you need for bikini/brazilian endeavors. I have tried several varieties and this is the best for bikini waxing. I hate the fruity smell but it got the job done with little residue. I was beyond pleased. It works with or without fabric strips. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great wax for multi uses.  Works awesome on very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> the name says it all smooth. Very efficient and quick for woman with fast hair growth, couldn&#x27;t maintain without this product as its a lot of work to keep that unwanted hair away.</li>
