<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Good product, but after a week, the nozzle got jammed with glitter and now doesn&#x27;t work. I had to get another bottle.</li>
    <li> My red hair looks amazing with glitter!</li>
    <li> I have the sexiest skin imagined- sparkling in my favourite way. Plus being a vegan it matters the product is cruelty free.</li>
    <li> Please never stop selling this one.</li>
    <li> It’s easy to wash off and it doesn&#x27;t stain. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have brown hair and it looks amazing</li>
    <li> Returned product.  Very little to no glitter and had to spray between 8-10x to see anything.</li>
    <li> This spray has a nice shimmer to it but I would hesitate to actually call it a glitter spray.  I guess I&#x27;m jaded by the highly glittered 90s but this spray just doesn&#x27;t have THAT.  It&#x27;s nice, it does add some shimmer and there are times it catches the light just right but if you&#x27;re like me and living in a time warp, this will not take you back to the 90s and clubbing to bad music like the Macarena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is nice though.  I got this at a discount in exchange for a review.</li>
    <li> What girl can&#x27;t use a little more glitter in her life? Seriously, this is a great, fun product.  It is the Glitter Spray for hair and body by It Haircare.  It is a generous size bottle at 4.25 ounces.  It contains a light, non-sticky glitter spray that adds shimmer and shine to the hair and skin.  It is a whimsical and fun product to use.  It smells like a beach hairspray and leaves a light sparkly shimmer on skin and hair.  Not that I wear sparkly glitter a lot. But I will now, since this leaves a nice hint of shimmer.  I received this product at a promotional discount to try and provide my honest and unbiased opinion in return.</li>
    <li> Yes I am a glitter addict, thank you for noticing. I recently ran out of my favorite body glitter, which is no longer being made, so there was no chance I was going to pass up this spray. Not one day shall I go unsparkly! Anyway, the spray itself is thin and watery and dries quickly. It&#x27;s not a chunky glitter at all, more of a very fine shimmer. The effect is quite lovely. I tried it in both my hair and on my skin, and it lasted all night. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to rub off all over everything and everyone you touch the way some glitter sprays do. I was pleased and would definitely use this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, the glitter doesn&#x27;t really stay on throughout the day. Plus it&#x27;s not even glitter i would say that it&#x27;s more of a shimmer spray. You can barely see the shimmer in your hair. You can kinda see it on your skin. You also have to spray a lot but it&#x27;s still not that noticeable. Also i didn&#x27;t like the smell of it.</li>
    <li> This is absolute JUNK!  I bought this for my figure skater to spray in her hair and skin.  I curled her hair, then sprayed.... The curls went straight.  This is nothing more than water mixed with glitter.  It is NOT hairspray.  And the glitter was barely noticeable.  I ended up having to curl her hair again.  I could have mixed this concoction up myself!  It takes forever and a day to dry on both skin and hair.  Useless....</li>
    <li> This is the perfect amount of sparkle for everyday use. I love glitter, don&#x27;t get me wrong. I mean, I love the stuff. But I also understand that not every occasion calls for me to look like a sparkly magical unicorn. I wear a lot of dresses and feel that this spray gives my legs that non-dry moisturized look without looking like I&#x27;m wearing nylons. I love it! I would definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I acquired this product from AMZ Review Trader for reviewing purposes.</li>
    <li> I love glitter and thought this would be a fun way to easily wear it. I love that you can use on your body as well as your hair. When using the spray it comes out evenly and doesn’t just squirt out like others I have used. I personally think it smells really good but it doesn’t last very long, I have issues with things that are strong because it gives me a headache and this didn’t at all which was great.&lt;br /&gt;If my review helped you, please click on &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; below. Thank you. :)&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
    <li> meh, I LOVE the sparkles but two applications into it, the sprayer is clogged and I can&#x27;t fix it or get it spray anymore no matter what I do to clean it with hot water.  I know it&#x27;s the sparkles inside clogging the pump but really????  I just pour it into lotion to use it now since I can&#x27;t use the pump.  I like the sparkly look but now that I cannot use the pump spray so I cannot use in my hair - boo.  Maybe I got a bad pump, so I&#x27;ll try finding a new pump and put this into the new one...we&#x27;ll see.  For now, disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bought the Glitter Spay Body Spray in trade for a review. I got it for my Daughter and she loves it. she uses it for her hair and Lightly around her chest/neck area. and it last not only through the evening while she is out. She has to take a shower to wash it out, which is really nice that she is not leaving it behind every where she sits. She wants more glitter spray from it.</li>
    <li> Just perfect..Exactly what I was going for..Perfect shimmer</li>
    <li> My daughter gives this 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Glitter stays on for long periods.&lt;br /&gt;She loves the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Large amount of glitter comes out in each squirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got at a cheaper price to write a review</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of glitter so much so that at one point in time my nickname actually was &amp;#34;Glitter Girl&amp;#34;. In fact I actually feel almost naked if I don&#x27;t have glitter somewhere on me. With that being said when I came across It Glitter Body Spray I knew I just had to have it! This glitter body spray is absolutely amazing. The glitter isn&#x27;t tacky but glamorous and classy. The smell to this glitter body spray is also really nice and not strong. I love how easy this glitter body spray is to use and how it gives out the right amount of beautiful shimmer! I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> Got this specifically to review it.  I would describe it as more if a shimmer than a glitter.  Stayed on well.</li>
    <li> Not very sparkly... no shimmer on the skin</li>
    <li> Product for review: great product. My daughter loves the glitter!!</li>
    <li> Love this spray, it doesn&#x27;t look glittery, it makes my hair look shiny and bright! I have an ombré, so it will be great for dark hair to light hair. Fast delivery! Thx!</li>
    <li> This spray was literally like a spray bottle, which made it easier to use to apply the glitter where you want.  The glitter has no colored base, so when you spray it, you are solely seeing the glitter and no other liquid. The glitter is just more of a iridescent color, which really captures the light.  It is small and subtle too, helping the glitter cling more to your skin or hair without being overwhelming. I was really pleased with that aspect the most. The more you spray. The more it builds the glitter, either creating a heavy sparkle or light shine. Perfect for using for different occassions or even just day to day when you want that extra &amp;#34;oopmh&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*DISCLAIMER: THIS ITEM WAS SENT TO ME AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST, UNBIASED REVIEW*</li>
    <li> I really like the shimmer that this product gives off. I am using it on my kids and they are young so I don&#x27;t want them to be covered in glitter, but they love the pixie dust spray. I love that they can  get to pretend and I still can feel good about the appearance the product gives off. It also washes off very easily which is a plus if you have ever dealt with glitter before.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for free or a reduced price but the opinion seen above is my own.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my sister (15) she loves the glitter spray! Works well and leaves a nice sparkle</li>
    <li> In love with this. Easy. Fun. No mess. Great for any occasion.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised that this product didn&#x27;t feel sticky. Went on smoothly and evenly. More of sheen than a shimmer which is great by me. Of all body shimmer products I&#x27;ve used this is so far my favorite.</li>
    <li> I found a glitter spray that actually works and I love it !  It goes on smooth and dries quickly and has a light fresh scent. I sprayed it on my hair and body and it does&#x27;nt flack off or smear.It&#x27;s gorgeous when the sunlight hits the glitter and it looks like 24 caret gold flakes and even when the night lights hit it looks the same. I felt and looked gorgeous and have gotten alot of compliments from my nieces and family. I&#x27;m going to purchase this for family members for christmas. I&#x27;m going to be the favorite aunt since I did&#x27;nt give my glitter spray up! I received this gift for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way, people! Depending on just how glittery you want to be, just shake well and go light. You can always add more if you think you need it. You get a lot for the money spent - and it adds such a fun touch on special occasions and for costume parties, etc. Love this! Washes out of hair and off of the skin easily enough.</li>
    <li> It is definitely not a necessity, but it always add some more glam to your looks. It adds to the holiday spirit if you go on a beach party or just hanging out with friends. Bright color lipsticks and some glitter is always pleasant to look at during the summer season. I got it at discount for my review. I think this spray is a nice accessory both for us ladies and kids.</li>
    <li> This glitter spray is a decent product compared to a few others on the market. It does have a bit of shimmer but definitely not the &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34; look I expected. Maybe it should be called a shimmer spray instead. The shimmer in the product doesn&#x27;t clog, the shimmer distributes evenly and doesn&#x27;t all end up in just the one spot. For the price, not a bad deal! Product did arrive about a week later than promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN.</li>
    <li> So unlike most of the reviews here I did NOT receive this product free to review so you know my review is unbiased lol! Honestly though this is such a pretty glitter spray I will definitely be buying again. Everything is wonderful from the smell to the staying power to the fine sparkle you get from this product! I feel like I&#x27;m glowing when I wear this glitter spray it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> My daughter gave me this bottle of glitter...I LOVE IT and am addicted!!!  Sparkle on People!!!</li>
    <li> Meh - this is just okay. Not as sparkly as I expected. I am surprised because it got so many great reviews.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product. Best glitter product I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I always wanted something amazing, cute and glamorous at the same time. Glitter is always a favorite but it’s hard to place them on things sometimes. Imagine my surprise when I saw the Glitter spray. It’s pretty amusing to use.</li>
    <li> My fiancee wanted this because she&#x27;s into glitter spray. She was pleasantly surprised how big the bottles are and how long they will last as compared to the smaller bottles that may only work for a few times. This will work for a long time. She is very happy with the coverage. I was given a discount to provide my open and honest opinion, and in our opinion this is a quality product and she plans on recommending it to her friends.</li>
    <li> Found this item on AMZREVIEWTRADER and really like it. It adds to the summer glow. The only concern I have is that when you spray it, it comes out in a mist therefore it goes everywhere...where you want and don&#x27;t want it.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m not 14, or even 24, or 34, or &amp;#60;sigh&amp;#62; 44 but I love this Glitter Body and Hair Spray. Any female that has made it to (or really flippin&#x27; close to) that fifth decade will understand that my skin just doesn&#x27;t have that same youthful glow anymore. There are tiny (hahaha, I&#x27;m calling them tiny) line and spots and bumps, etc.. that keep my skin from looking as young as I&#x27;d like.  Anyway, a few years ago I read about a photography trick in one of the publications and it was talking about how to photograph make-overs and before / after pictures and it strongly suggested using oil on the &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; picture of the subject because &amp;#34;sheen will allow the eye to move smoothly, giving the instant appearance of lengthening, slimming, and youthfulness&amp;#34;. So, after drenching myself in oil and throwing confetti in the air (I get excited when I find tips like this, go figure) I realized that being coated in a heavy oil is not a wonderful state to be in and I also realized that my dry cleaner is a total grump when he has to try (not successfully) to get oil stains out of silk blouses. I toned it down a bit and started using some of the soft shimmer products on the market. Love the results! But (there&#x27;s ALWAYS a but) the products that I found (before this one, wait for it, I&#x27;m getting there) were either so powdery that they flaked off, or they were too strong fragrance-wise, or they left me looking like I just completed an art class with a huge class of unruly kindergarten students. THEN (told you I&#x27;d get here!) I found this IT Glitter Spray and I&#x27;m totally in love with it!! It goes on beautifully and the shimmer is warm and bright and gorgeous! Love this product and love the results I get from using IT! I use this spray on my legs when I&#x27;m wearing shorts or dresses and on my arms when I&#x27;m going sleeveless or in short sleeves. I received this IT Glitter Spray for evaluation and an unbiased review and now it&#x27;s a staple in my daily routine.</li>
    <li> I just received this glitter spray today and works great. I got it for my daughter to put in her hair she loves it says she feels like a magical princess. I recommend this to anyone who has a little girl or anyone for that matter. Really nice and easy to clean off.</li>
    <li> I remember back to my tween and teen years and the amount of sticky, goopy gel body glitter that I gooped on my arms and legs and am amazed at the things I did to have a shimmer.  I received this bottle of glitter body spray and was excited to see that technology has advanced to such a stage that we no longer need to goop gel on our arms and wait for it to dry.  I love that this glitter body spray leaves a gentle glimmer on your skin that looks like a natural sparkly glow (nothing crazy and obvious).  It is nice for being out in the sun and giving that sort of sun-kissed idea to your outdoor look.  It is fun and definitely dresses up my skin in a beautiful way.</li>
    <li> I love me some glitter. What girl doesn&#x27;t like to sparkle? When I saw this product, I was excited to see that it was intended for hair and skin. That&#x27;s my kind of product. However, when I received the product, I was a bit let down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This product is great on skin. Not too much sparkle. Looks pretty on a nice tan whether you are going to the beach or going out with the girls.&lt;br /&gt;2) I can&#x27;t say the same about hair. I couldn&#x27;t really see the sparkle. It is also way too wet of a product to be use on styled hair, unless you are ready to flatten waves or curls.&lt;br /&gt;3) The smell isn&#x27;t that great. It reminds me of a perfume that my grandmother used to wear. I am not ready to smell that grown up yet. Luckily the smell doesn&#x27;t really linger after it has dried on skin. It does kind of linger on hair though.&lt;br /&gt;4) The nozzle does get clogged sometimes. However, just run it under some hot water and it tends to help make it spray evenly again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product if you are looking to enhance your skin. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a hair product though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my princess daughter who loves to sparkle. Most sparkle/glitter can have a weird smell, this product does not. It smells so good. I got this one a discount in honor of my review. Love it.</li>
    <li> I do like this glitter spray! It sprays pretty evenly although you do have to rub it around a little. It lasts decently long and does not feel sticky to the touch. It has a nice scent and does not fade away fast.</li>
    <li> Not bad at all like other suggest does what it&#x27;s suppose to nice shine and it did get clogged once but I ran it under wanted and it has worked fine since</li>
    <li> I received this for free from Amazon Review Trader. I enjoyed the smell, but my tween girls could not stand the smell.  It looked beautiful when you sprayed it on to your skin, but if you rubbed your skin, all the glitter seemed to wipe away.</li>
    <li> I love this glitter, that I got an exchange for a review. It smells so pleasant, I could just use it as a perfume. I&#x27;m in love with this glitter. I would buy this again and again. I love the sparkle this product gives me. This glitter is defiantly worth it every time. It gives me a glow that lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This is so cute, would love more!</li>
    <li> Nice small flecs of glitter, subtle smell. It&#x27;s pretty!  Need some sparkle to glam it up?, This is your spray!&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount to try out this product and give my own opinion.  ...I&#x27;m sure my daughters will highjack this from me soon.</li>
    <li> My 5 year old daughter LOVES this stuff!  I spray it onto her hair each day after doing her hair, and it gives her the subtlest shimmer and a huge boost of confidence.  This isn&#x27;t a gaudy amount of shine, either.  I actually tried getting a photo of it, but it&#x27;s so delicate, the glitter doesn&#x27;t even show up in photos.  When the light hits it just perfectly though, WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves using this glitter spray in her hair for cheerleading, going to school... really, she loves using it every opportunity she gets!  I enjoy it, because I feel it helps keep the fly-aways at bay a little longer throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  I have to come back and edit my review - about 1/4 of the way through the bottle, our nozzle has clogged.  I&#x27;ve tried cleaning it with warm water, soaking it overnight, tried to find another nozzle that fit, but nothing has worked!  Not sure we will get to use the other 75% of the product, after all :(</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of body glitter. It used to be very popular to wear in the late 90s, early 00&#x27;s. To know that they have a glitter product out on the market that is ok enough to spray in your hair tells me that they have come a long way in creating products. My daughters also love glitter, so they love it when I spray some of this on their skin or even in their hair. I don&#x27;t use too much. Just a couple of sprays is enough. I see something like this being a good product to use for nights out on the town or for when your children go to dances such as prom. *Received for review purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> DISCLAIMER: I received a product discount for this review.  I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars, because of it&#x27;s scent. To me, it&#x27;s too perfumey. Otherwise, this glitter spray is fantastic. It went on wet, and I was worried, that it wasn&#x27;t going to be glittery enough. Happily, I was wrong. Once dry, my skin was very glittery.  I really like the glitter body spray, and will be using it for our Halloween in July party.</li>
    <li> Okay, forget the glitter - I&#x27;m in love with the scent! This smells a lot like the original Neutrogena body wash which I LOVED and always wished I didn&#x27;t have to wash off. The glitter is very, very fine and gives you a nice shimmer, and the spray didn&#x27;t leave a sticky film or anything. I was hesitant to put this in my hair but I braved it. It doesn&#x27;t get your hair oily, is fine enough to stay in when you brush your hair, and leaves a lovely subtle gleam. It&#x27;s perfect for looking a little &amp;#34;done up&amp;#34; in a subtle way, without looking like your stylist was kidnapped and replaced with a tween girl. Just a tiny little twinkle here and there - it&#x27;s lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
    <li> This product has a horrendous smell and doesn&#x27;t even add that much glitter to hair or skin. I DO NOT recommend this to anyone, I wish I could return it but will settle for throwing it away. Honestly,it is just like spraying stinky water all over your body with a very subtle, unnoticeable amount of glitter.</li>
    <li> This hair and body glitter looks great and smells good. I never tried a spray before.</li>
    <li> This is definitely my go-to when I’m going to the club.</li>
    <li> It’s exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> I was expecting way more glitter and shimmer from a single spray.  If you want to actually stand out, you must apply at least 8-10 layers of sprays to get a significant shimmer.  There were hardly any glitter on my hair, and I have a great deal of volume.  It would not have been hard for the glitter to have stuck.  After reviewing the pictures I took for the event, my body did not appear to have any glitter on.  The only time I would personally notice any glitter is when I&#x27;m right up front the mirror and looking for it on my skin.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the fragrance</li>
    <li> I purchased this on a whim because I thought it might be fun to spray a little shimmer in my Daughters hair for prom. The effect was stunning. We also used a light misting on my Daughters skin so she shimmered from head to toe. It was absolutely beautiful.</li>
    <li> Shows great on brown hair</li>
    <li> Really shiny and really popular among our group!</li>
    <li> This product is great! Leaves the skin glowing!</li>
    <li> after the first use I had to return it because the bottle wouldn&#x27;t spray.  the glitter itself was nice, but the scent was also too strong for me.</li>
    <li> I occasionally use Body Glitter. I made this purchase for my daughters (5 and 12). They have used it and loved it. When this Glitter Spray Body Spray arrived, I did try it in addition to them using it.&lt;br /&gt;The Glitter Spray is easy to use. Comes out thin so it goes on a little more even than other brands we have tried. This Glitter Spray also has different sizes of glitter and shimmer so it makes it look better once on. It does dry pretty quick, about 30 seconds. I did leave it on, so have my daughters and it did not run or transfer onto clothing. This Glitter Spray can be used in your hair and on your body, there is no residue or stickiness at all with any of the applications. Glitter Spray is easy to apply and just as easy to shower off&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this Glitter Spray 4 stars was the scent. I personally would have either liked it to be unscented so I could choose what other scent I had available or to have it smell a little more fresh. The scent does slightly disappear the longer you are wearing the Spray so if it is going to be on for an extended time you can spray something else on you. The scent is not overpowering or too strong so it is not a huge deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I did receive this product for review purposes. All opinions and thoughts are my own and honest.*</li>
    <li> This smells fabulous and leaves a fine glittery shimmer on your skin. Perfect for going out, special occasions, or just everyday shine!  I received this for an honest and I highly recommend this fabulous product.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift. I hope my friend will love it.</li>
    <li> Used this before a night on the town, it&#x27;s light enough it adds just the right touch!! Thank you for exchanging your product for my review!</li>
    <li> I really liked that this glitter spray went on evenly and did not have big pieces. The smell is nice not overbearing. When I discovered a discount code for this I ordered it quickly. The glitter spray is easy to use, I just get ready for my date night with hubby and then spray it on last. It really has a nice feel and makes the night more fun!</li>
    <li> It smelled interesting, but boy did I sparkle! I feel so pretty wearing it.</li>
    <li> This is perfectly nice skin glitter and I like that it stays put, but it doesn&#x27;t work for hair.  It&#x27;s super wet (not hair spray texture like i had hoped) and is too subtle.</li>
    <li> I love it! I’m definitely buying this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really a fan of glitter, but my friend bought it and I used hers. It was awesome for the night we went out.</li>
    <li> I used this last weekend when I went out with my friends.  I really enjoy the sparkles or glitter on my skin and in my hair.  I had some rave reviews.  A few people asked me how I did that.  Secret.</li>
    <li> I tried this and used it around my house.  Well I got confident enough to spray it on for my friends wedding and I got so many compliments.  I will use this when I go out on the weekends for now on</li>
    <li> I had fun using this! We tried it first on my sister’s hair. It was easy to use and we can apply it almost anywhere on the hair and even on the body. It was also clean since there was no glitter or sticky glue all over our hands. It was amazing!</li>
    <li> It looks nice, and the bottle lasts longer than the hairspray glitter cans.</li>
    <li> Wow, Awesome product.  I bought this on my husband&#x27;s account and I use it on a daily basis.  I love this glitter. It sprays on smooth and doesn&#x27;t smudge like other brands. I also use several other products from this brand. My husband likes the way I shimmer when I&#x27;m wearing it as well.</li>
    <li> Pure honesty. This product sucks! I bought it thinking there would be an abundance of big glitter chunks shimmering on my skin. I sprayed it only to find that it is a bottle of water with the tiniest pieces of glitter in it. And I mean so tiny that you cannot see them! Repeat: YOU CANNOT SEE THE GLITTER AT ALL. Do not buy this product. You&#x27;d be wasting your money.</li>
    <li> here is the true review: Glitter is light when applied, and it fades within 20 minutes ( I mean literally it will be like you applied plain water all over) ...For $7 i would say still it is not worth ...I don&#x27;t even feel like returning it...such a waste!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. I was expecting an abundance of glitter, instead you get a wet skin shimmer that needs direct light to see. Not useful if you are going anywhere dark: night, bar, club etc. Maybe this is a good product if you want to have that extra glisten at your day job or while at the beach. I&#x27;ll be buying real glitter next time. Don&#x27;t expect much from this product.</li>
    <li> I brought this product for my daughter because she loves Glitter and this is perfect for the Summer. She is so happy with my purchase. It is very easy to apply and take off, It does not stain, gives your hair or body a light simmer glow and perfect for any age.&lt;br /&gt;This is great for special events, birthday parties, parties, vacations, going to the beach, performances and Holidays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest option.</li>
    <li> This is actually a very fun glitter spray for me.&lt;br /&gt;I used this on top of my fake tan and it look amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;I havent really tried putting it in my hair so I cannot comment about that.&lt;br /&gt;I mainly use it on my legs, arms and neck to shoulder area on top of my fake tan, and it gave me a glowing bronzy shine.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is the perfect match for a fake tan instead of just using it alone.&lt;br /&gt;It dispenses the right amount of glitter, I feel like it is more of a natural look than a more polished glittered/formal look.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is more likely transparent, so you&#x27;ll know if it&#x27;s time to get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;I dont have any issues with the scent as it is very very mild.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love and I find that I will regularly use it now more than ever (summer time).&lt;br /&gt;I purchase this using a promo code for testing.</li>
    <li> This is definitely not the first glitter spray I&#x27;ve bought. With a 9 y/o girl who has dance recitals and just generally loves things that sparkle or shine, I&#x27;ve been through a few. This one impressed me for a few reasons. For starters, it doesn&#x27;t have that nasty glue smell or smell like rubbing alcohol. That&#x27;s just off putting no matter how nice it looks. If it stinks, that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going smell like until your next shower. NO way would I be ok with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a very fine glitter. It&#x27;s not chunky like many of the others and that makes it less likely to clog up the pump. Again, many of them have a glue like smell because there is actual glue in the base. Because the glitter is so fine, you can choose the intensity of the effect. With just a light spray, you get a very subtle, but noticeable and feminine shimmer. If you do further coats it becomes more intense and goes toward the sparkle spectrum. I like the ability to choose exactly the type of look I&#x27;m going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really works great in hair as well, but it&#x27;s rather hard to really see unless you&#x27;re in sunlight. I sprayed it in my daughter&#x27;s hair and she was upset because she couldn&#x27;t see it. I took her outside and brought a mirror, and she was able to see it well. I believe her exact words were, &amp;#34;Mom!!! I look like a fairy princess!&amp;#34; That was rather cute and very sweet. My son, on the other hand, saw the glitter that had blown back in my face because of the fan and told me I looked like a Twilight vampire. I guess you could say that, but their glitter is much chunkier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shimmer lasts all day long and catches the light beautifully. Whether it&#x27;s for a recital, a night out or a special occasion, you can tailor your look to shine out from the crowd with this spray. I definitely appreciate its versatility. Definitely a good buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY FAIR AND HONEST REVIEW.

    <li> I absolutely love this glitter spray! As soon as I received it, I used it! The spray itself smells amazing!! It reminds me of a scent I&#x27;ve smelled as a kids. The product isn&#x27;t sticky at all, and dries really fast! It leaves a glittery shine that looks amazing! I was going to give it to my niece, but I like it so well that I&#x27;m keeping it. The bottle is really pretty too. It looks really nice and there is nothing cheap looking at all.  I definitely give this product 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I was given this product for free or at a low discounted price. In exchange I have given my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> This Glitter Spray Body Spray for body and hair makes me feel like a young girl again. Which is nice as I am over 50. I liked how well it went on. As well as that it does not come off. It is not greasy on my skin. Or heavy when put into my hair. If you would like to know more about what I thought of it Please check out my thoughts at MommiesPointofView.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> I bought this for an odd reason: to make fairy dust from the tooth fairy! I sprayed a $5 bill with this stuff to make it sparkle for our daughter so she thought the tooth fairy came (this in no way defaced the bill -- you can rub it off). It was such a nice, subtle sparkle when the light hit it. It does not look flashy and cheap as real glitter does -- it just adds some shimmer. They should call it &amp;#34;shimmer spray&amp;#34;. Smells good. Looks nice for special events or the tooth fairy&#x27;s visits!</li>
    <li> Love it - use it on my blonde hair and a little on my face.  Adds pizzaz</li>
    <li> Super shimmery but not chunky glittery which comes across looking tacky.</li>
    <li> It would be a great product but for the fact that it got clogged after using it just a few days.  That rendered it useless.  This is why I gave it just 3 stars.  Unless the pump is manufacture differently, it&#x27;s good for about 3-4 times of use.  The seller was great, however.  We can&#x27;t hold a seller accountable for the manufacturing.</li>
    <li> I shook vigorously, sprayed liberally, but didn&#x27;t see much sparkle. It&#x27;s there but hard to see. Also, the container is a pump bottle. What comes out is more liquid than an aerosol might provide.</li>
    <li> This is a spray bottle top. Non aerosol. It does have a smell to it but you don&#x27;t really need that much to get the effects.  You do need to shake this first. The glitter had settled to the bottom so make sure its well shaken before you spray it. It does need a moment to dry but after that it was not sticky at all. You might need to rub it in as the glitter comes out a little splotchy in some areas.  I sprayed some in my daughters hair and you can&#x27;t notice it until it dries. Its very subtle, but when it does dry its very pretty. This is not your costume glitter hairspray this is very fine very nice glitter effect.  It is going to be perfect for a wedding coming up where she is a flower girl.  I did receive a discount sample in order to facilitate this review. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Serves it&#x27;s purpose. I like this product. It isn&#x27;t sticky. Gives just the right amount of sparkle and was a great bargain through Amazon review trader</li>
    <li> This stuff is perfect for what I was wanting! I do updos for school dances and a lot of the girls want glitter without using loose glitter. I sprayed some on my arm to test it out and it actually didn&#x27;t end up all over the place and to top it off, it wasn&#x27;t greasy so I will be able to use in their hair as well!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this for my daughter who absolutely loves the Barbie episode where the town is out of glitter. On that episode there was a spray bottle of glitter and she&#x27;s been begging me for one ever since! I&#x27;ll admit, I wasn&#x27;t wild about purchasing a bottle of spray glitter, but I did it anyway. Well then it comes in and I have to say, I don&#x27;t think I want to hand it over! This stuff is so awesome! It&#x27;s actually very subtle, so you won&#x27;t look like you&#x27;ve been cuddling up with RuPaul or anything like that! It sprays out in a very fine mist (which has a pleasant scent by the way...think lightly scented hair spray smell) and it ever so lightly distributes shimmer. I&#x27;ve taken a picture of what it looks like sprayed onto my black shirt so you can get an idea. It&#x27;s just very pretty and fun! It stayed on all day but washed off easily in the shower. Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discounted for evaluation</li>
    <li> Just not very nice... Sorry.</li>
    <li> Love the way it stays on your skin for hours even being very active.</li>
    <li> Very good glitter spray. It has just the right amount of colour so it’s not overpowering and stays a while. It also comes out easy enough when washed. Ideal for parties, ballet etc.</li>
    <li> You really can’t beat quality. It just shows with the results. It doesn’t come with nasty side effects either and I’m particularly grateful for that.</li>
    <li> I like this because I can spray a little on my finger and use it as eye glitter or anything.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful, it smells wonderful, it glitters and sparkles everywhere. Thank-you I love it!</li>
    <li> I‘ve been looking for something like this! It’s great! Will use it until the very last spray.</li>
    <li> Very glittery!  Very lite, somewhat powdery fragrance, not strong or overpowering - it works well with perfume!</li>
</ol>
