      <li>The price was even better.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m glad I ordered it anyway.</li>
      <li>i love these.</li>
      <li>I love that these are made with sturdy plastic and they didn&#x27;t cost a lot of money.</li>
      <li>I figured the print on the plastic would be a guide for sizing or maybe a punch out or something else to accommodate more people</li>
      <li>Would love to write a review, but I am still waiting to receive the product...</li>
      <li>Love the choice of shapes also.</li>
      <li>I love this product I have never had eyebrows</li>
      <li>IT&#x27;S OK</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re worth it!!</li>
      <li>They were cheap and they are more than I thought they would be.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not that easy to use</li>
      <li>These little flimsy plastic pieces are awesome.</li>
      <li>But I do like them and hope it will be alot easier to draw them on and fill them in,than before where it would take me hours to fell comfortable with them.</li>
      <li>They made things a whole lot easier and they&#x27;re just the most convenient thing.</li>
      <li>so so...have to be able to line them up properly, but, works ok</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a quick fix.</li>
      <li>I bought this perfect eyebrow shaping stencils,are very easy to use it came in 4 stencils for different shapes ,so far I&#x27;ve used 2 only ,made my eyebrows pro look.</li>
      <li>this is great to have, will  take a little pratice</li>
      <li>It was worth my money and has taken off time for doing my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>I had never used these before, but once I searched youtube for some instructions I found them to be really useful.</li>
      <li>Well worth the couple of bucks.</li>
      <li>its easy to use and gives me very natural shaped eyebrows.</li>
      <li>Worked great the first time, not difficult, and they are pretty sturdy pieces of plastic, so I think they will last a long time.</li>
      <li>but If I had to guess who these would fit, I would say young teens.</li>
      <li>THIS IS MY FIRST TIME</li>
      <li>Think they will be easy enough to figure out for those who shape their eyebrows though.</li>
      <li>Really like these.</li>
      <li>the truth is that I like these templates to eyebrows, I look good, it looks awful when I paint my eyebrows, none of the 4 templates fit me, I would recommend not prefer to paint my eyebrows myself without any help and I is far better, otherwise, the shipping was very delayed</li>
      <li>the shape to these are great, but run very thin</li>
      <li>Just got to get use to the new me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had difficulty in drawing my eyebrows but this simple tool just made it so much easier to complete my makeup.</li>
      <li>For a peson who still has some eyebrows left, the stencils dont really line up with my eyebrowns.</li>
      <li>and I do wish they has English ones because it would be very helpful if they did.</li>

    <li> if your tired of spending money going to get you brows done this is great to have, will  take a little pratice but you wil get the hang on to it.</li>
    <li> I love that these are made with sturdy plastic and they didn&#x27;t cost a lot of money. I know I&#x27;ll have these for a long time. Well worth the couple of bucks.</li>
    <li> Thought this would help me with my eyebrows, but product is hard to handle. Slips very easily. Think it should be made of a softer material as well. Putting tabs on ends of stencils would help a lot.</li>
    <li> I like that there are different style stencils to choose from. They do seem a little wide for my face, but that&#x27;s alright. This saves time when I don&#x27;t have my eyebrows arched or I make a mistake, it&#x27;s a quick fix.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago and I haven&#x27;t gotten it yet. They said they would send it again, and still haven&#x27;t gotten it. What a waste of time.</li>
    <li> Would love to write a review, but I am still waiting to receive the product... some 4 1/2 weeks later.</li>
    <li> I love this product I have never had eyebrows so now I have a chance to enjoys some for once in my life. Just got to get use to the new me.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT!! Helps me outline my eye browns and all I have to do is wash them if they get dirty! Thank goodness!</li>
    <li> i dont ever use this they do not fit my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;but if someone does fit them perfectly it would be real easy to do your brows</li>
    <li> I like the fact that you have 4 different shapes &amp; sizes to play around with but i am still trying to get a hang of using it because the instructions are not in English. You have to kind of figure it out yourself.</li>
    <li> Took to long to come.  Too small maybe for a child.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with this item. I would definitely recommend this item to other people. It was worth my money and has taken off time for doing my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> this item is to a toy. dont know whybits listed as one. this item is eyebrow stencils, which I find very hard to use.</li>
    <li> Really like these. They&#x27;re not for me to use but to put in my flea market booth. The only thing I would change would be to put the instructions in English. Think they will be easy enough to figure out for those who shape their eyebrows though.</li>
    <li> so so...have to be able to line them up properly, but, works ok</li>
    <li> I bought this perfect eyebrow shaping stencils,are very easy to use it came in 4 stencils for different shapes ,so far I&#x27;ve used 2 only ,made my eyebrows pro look.</li>
    <li> They were cheap and they are more than I thought they would be.&lt;br /&gt;My eyebrows look fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend them to others.</li>
    <li> Got tired of going to the mall to get my eyebrows shaped. These stencils are perfect for me. The price was even better.</li>
    <li> For a peson who still has some eyebrows left, the stencils dont really line up with my eyebrowns. The instrustions are all in chines and I do wish they has English ones because it would be very helpful if they did. But I do like them and hope it will be alot easier to draw them on and fill them in,than before where it would take me hours to fell comfortable with them.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, shapes great. Was surprized at the quality for the price. Seen the same item for $6.00 ,but so paper like you could only use once. Love the choice of shapes also.</li>
    <li> used them one and then that was it. Not that easy to use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had difficulty in drawing my eyebrows but this simple tool just made it so much easier to complete my makeup. I first thought it&#x27;s rather silly to buy this but I&#x27;m glad I ordered it anyway.</li>
    <li> i love these. They made things a whole lot easier and they&#x27;re just the most convenient thing. I don&#x27;t like all the sizes though. i only need one. I wish everybody could buy and try these out. They&#x27;re worth it!!</li>
    <li> These little flimsy plastic pieces are awesome. I like the lines on it to help make it easier to &amp;#34;fill&amp;#34; in your brows. Price and quality is great.</li>
    <li> I had never used these before, but once I searched youtube for some instructions I found them to be really useful. Worked great the first time, not difficult, and they are pretty sturdy pieces of plastic, so I think they will last a long time.</li>
    <li> its easy to use and gives me very natural shaped eyebrows. without this it takes me forever to shape and shade my bushy eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Albeit somewhat difficult to use but that might not be an issue for others.</li>
    <li> the truth is that I like these templates to eyebrows, I look good, it looks awful when I paint my eyebrows, none of the 4 templates fit me, I would recommend not prefer to paint my eyebrows myself without any help and I is far better, otherwise, the shipping was very delayed</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S OK BUT A LITTLE HARD. THIS IS MY FIRST TIME EVER TRYING THESE AND WISHED THEY CAME WITH SOMETHING STICKY JUST TO HOLD IT ON. ALSO MINE CAME WITH NO INSTRUCTIONS AT ALL. THE WORDS ARE ALL CHINESE.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to use and you h ave a hard time positioning it. Would not recommend it at all and wouldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> I figured the print on the plastic would be a guide for sizing or maybe a punch out or something else to accommodate more people but If I had to guess who these would fit, I would say young teens. If you are a small person then they may work well for you.</li>
    <li> the shape to these are great, but run very thin</li>
    <li> the only thing i didnt like about this item is that i was hoping to get a thicker/wider brow stencil because thicker brows are in</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for and a very cheap price.  It brings 4 stencils, some wider than the other one.</li>
