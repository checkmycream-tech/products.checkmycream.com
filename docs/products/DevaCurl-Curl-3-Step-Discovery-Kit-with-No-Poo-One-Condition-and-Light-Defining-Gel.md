      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love the drying towel to prevent frizz for my curly hair</li>
      <li>Smells very clean,  kinda like a baby smell.</li>
      <li>At first it seemed to make my hair feel really good</li>
      <li>I really liked that it has a little bit of every DEVA product so you can figure out which works best with your hair.  </li>
      <li>Best of all, after two shampoos I can see some bounce, definition, and fun curl come back into my hair.</li>
      <li>I now use a sulfate free clarifying shampoo and the One Condition from time to time.  </li>
      <li>Shampoo is sulfate free - does NOT lather.</li>
      <li>and it was like getting the towel for free.</li>
      <li>The No-Poo just doesn&#x27;t seem to clean well.</li>
      <li>Not only was the smell not bad, I liked it!  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s nothing special.  </li>
      <li>(no I didn&#x27;t tote the special shampoo etc to Mexico)  </li>
      <li>Great if you&#x27;re curious about the Curly Girl lifestyle.</li>
      <li>these products make my hair super shiny.  </li>
      <li>its super easy and fast as well.  </li>
      <li>DevaCurl really makes my hair light and super curly.</li>
      <li>These products did absolutely nothing for my fine, wavy hair.</li>
      <li>Now if I could only find a good stylist in my area that will cut my hair like curly girls rather than geometrically correct cuts for straight hair.</li>
      <li>so worth the money.</li>
      <li>The gel is useful</li>
      <li>Other than the Waac I would&#x27;ve loved this product.</li>
      <li>these are just right.  </li>
      <li>I suddenly started to have dandruff and then washed my hair more.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t work for me, so back to Wen Fig, their most moisturizing formula.</li>
      <li>I have wavy on the sides to slightly more curly hair in back.</li>
      <li>Initially I loved everything about it until after my hair dried.</li>
      <li>have gotten more compliments on my soft, natural curls</li>
      <li>She has a tight afro and the products make it easy to style and easy to get a comb through.  </li>
      <li>My hair didn&#x27;t take well to the foam (it gets all crunchy and hard) but the other products work great at giving me nice, soft, non-frizzy curls.</li>
      <li>Months later, it&#x27;s still recovering and have had a lot more hair loss than normal.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought large bottles now,</li>
      <li>I was hoping this line was different, but I suppose since they don&#x27;t have any products specifically geared toward fine hair, it should come as no surprise that these products were not helpful to me at all.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t tell a huge difference between this a regular shampoo.</li>
      <li>This worked really well for bouncy curls....</li>
      <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t rinse out the product very well.  </li>
      <li>No poo and conditioner work really well with my curly hair.</li>
      <li>I finally used a clarifying shampoo and my hair looked and felt fabulous.  </li>
      <li>someone commented that it made their hair waxy, but I imagine that person just used too much.  </li>
      <li>Love the variety of products, but thought the towel was super small.</li>
      <li>I find that a lot of curly hair products are actually more geared toward people with coarse hair (as coarse wavy hair seems to be much more common than fine wavy hair).</li>
      <li>I use Wen (Fig, mainly) and have been wanting to try DevaCurl since before I used Wen.  </li>
      <li>This product came highly recommended to me by a licensed cosmetologist, because my hair wouldn&#x27;t stay curly throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I have 3a/b natural hair.</li>
      <li>My curls have never been so defined and yet soft.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m old fashion.</li>
      <li>Soft hair, but my scalp doesnt feel as clean due to very little poo....</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell a huge difference between this a regular shampoo. Smells very clean,  kinda like a baby smell. Shampoo is sulfate free - does NOT lather. Love the drying towel to prevent frizz for my curly hair</li>
    <li> Be very careful with this product.  The shampoo doesn&#x27;t rinse out the product very well.  The gel forms a layer on your scalp that can be very irritating.  I suddenly started to have dandruff and then washed my hair more.  I then noticed very dry skin and scabs on my scalp.  I talked to a doctor, and the products were irritating my scalp.  Months later, it&#x27;s still recovering and have had a lot more hair loss than normal.  I&#x27;m told it will still take some time for my scalp to heal.</li>
    <li> I use Wen (Fig, mainly) and have been wanting to try DevaCurl since before I used Wen.  My hair is fine/normal naturally blonde, long, wavy and dry, I need moisture and have a hard time finding products that moisturize well enough.  Well, the No Poo &amp; One condition weren&#x27;t moisturizing enough for me, it was almost like I had gone back to shampoo &amp; conditioner.  My hair felt parched after using them.  It didn&#x27;t work for me, so back to Wen Fig, their most moisturizing formula.</li>
    <li> Was not impressed with this product especially for the cost.</li>
    <li> Eh. I don&#x27;t know what all the hubbub is about. These products did absolutely nothing for my fine, wavy hair. I find that a lot of curly hair products are actually more geared toward people with coarse hair (as coarse wavy hair seems to be much more common than fine wavy hair). I was hoping this line was different, but I suppose since they don&#x27;t have any products specifically geared toward fine hair, it should come as no surprise that these products were not helpful to me at all. I&#x27;ve gone back to my regular routine. Sigh.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a travel kit for my daughter.  This is a great product line for women with curl hair.  Can be pricey over time, but you get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> I love it.  My curly hair is now curly instead of frizzy!!!.  After straightening, ironing and blow drying for 70 years, I finally found the secret .  I also bought one for my curly daughter and granddaughter.  I even found a Deva hairdresser 10 minutes from my house.</li>
    <li> Not sure why but this product and my curls were not a good match.  As with any hair product - everyone&#x27;s hair reacts differently.  And I have well water - I think my water and this product did not a match for my curls make.  The product smells great and anyone with curly hair should try it!</li>
    <li> Love it, it gave my hair volume and curl..so worth the money. I even bought some for my sister..Most amazing hair product I have tried!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Deva line of products for curly hair.  My curls have never been so defined and yet soft. Now if I could only find a good stylist in my area that will cut my hair like curly girls rather than geometrically correct cuts for straight hair.</li>
    <li> I hated this product. Initially I loved everything about it until after my hair dried. This product contains some type of waxy substance that leaves a waxy residue on the hair that took 3 washes to remove. It cleanses, hydrates, and defines, but not worth the wax. I have 3a/b natural hair. Other than the Waac I would&#x27;ve loved this product.</li>
    <li> This worked really well for bouncy curls.... Well initially.  Then after a week of use, my hair looked greasy and dirty.  I had to go back and forth to other shampoos to remove the grease.  I finally used a clarifying shampoo and my hair looked and felt fabulous.  Less grease as well.  I now use a sulfate free clarifying shampoo and the One Condition from time to time.  The light gel is great and doesn&#x27;t leave hair crunchy.  I also love the towel.  I will not purchase again though.  Not affordable.</li>
    <li> I love this curl system. The shampoo, or no-poo, has changed my hair for the better.&lt;br /&gt;After one week of use my curls are tighter and softer at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten more compliments on my soft, natural curls then I ever have.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Great introduction to DevaCurl products. All the products smell great and work well. Great if you&#x27;re curious about the Curly Girl lifestyle.</li>
    <li> No poo and conditioner work really well with my curly hair. I would recommend</li>
    <li> This was a perfect set to take on a trip for the whole family to use.</li>
    <li> I had previously bought the travel kit to give these products a try.  I purchased this set because it seemed like a good value for the products and it was like getting the towel for free.</li>
    <li> these products make my hair super shiny.  I followed the instructions on how to style after shampooing and conditioning.  I have very curly but not kinky hair, and it looks great after I style as they tell you to.  its super easy and fast as well.  I avoided these products for a long time because I was a ouidad girl, but I&#x27;m switching sides.  I used some ouidad shampoo after I started w/the no poo just to see the difference and the ouidad dried my hair out.  with the no poo I have to wash my hair more often than I used to (every week or so) so I might try the low poo and see how that goes.  but I do think that the products are great.  someone commented that it made their hair waxy, but I imagine that person just used too much.  I didn&#x27;t have that problem at all.  highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money for me. Lots of hype and didn&#x27;t deliver.  I have wavy on the sides to slightly more curly hair in back. I wouldn&#x27;t go out of the house looking like I did after carefully following the instructions on the video.  My daughter did it also.  Her hair is similar to mine. We both looked like we did our hair when we were in 3rd grade . The gel is useful I guess..  I took gel to Mexico and used it after washing my hair one day (no I didn&#x27;t tote the special shampoo etc to Mexico)  my curly do worked if pulled back with a headband. Everyone&#x27;s hair looks bad anyhow in Mexico in the humidity. Sorry to be negative, I had high hopes for this. Its back to my flat iron bob.</li>
    <li> Love the variety of products, but thought the towel was super small.</li>
    <li> Nice set, came well packaged and on time. A bit pricey for the money. But this is what you need for curly hair.</li>
    <li> This is a good buy.  I actually bought it so I could have nice sizes to travel with.  The real travel sizes are to small....these are just right.  I love all the Deva Curl products.</li>
    <li> Deva curl is awesome. I don&#x27;t think I will ever use anything else on my hair. If you have curly hair you have to give Deva curl a try.</li>
    <li> Soft hair, but my scalp doesnt feel as clean due to very little poo....</li>
    <li> Love it~ great product and great results.</li>
    <li> Love the sizes.  A great deal for the amount of things that you receive.  I think the shampoo is great for my bi-racial child&#x27;s hair.  She&#x27;s 1/2 African American and 1/2 Puerto Rican.  She has a tight afro and the products make it easy to style and easy to get a comb through.  My daughter (at age 4 1/2) can even use them herself in the shower.</li>
    <li> Hmm...I am not sure I like it.  At first it seemed to make my hair feel really good but after using it for a couple of weeks I noticed my hair looking dry, very dry.  I may have been doing something wrong but since I have to shampoo every day using this product maybe that is why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells good though!</li>
    <li> This product came highly recommended to me by a licensed cosmetologist, because my hair wouldn&#x27;t stay curly throughout the day.  It did not improve my curls.  I like the scents of all 4 products and the towel.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit to try this product line. And it&#x27;s great. DevaCurl really makes my hair light and super curly. The towel is also nice. If you read the guidelines on the bottles and towel - you&#x27;ll get a superior results. I&#x27;ve bought large bottles now, cause I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Awesome kit for trying out the product.  I really liked that it has a little bit of every DEVA product so you can figure out which works best with your hair.  The towel is excellent.  My hair didn&#x27;t take well to the foam (it gets all crunchy and hard) but the other products work great at giving me nice, soft, non-frizzy curls.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> The foam and gel  left my hair hard and wirey when it was dry.  I don&#x27;t see any benefits from any of the products within.  I will use up the shampoo and conditioner but it&#x27;s nothing special.  I won&#x27;t use the gel again.  The towel is the same as a microfiber towel you can get anywhere like Walmart, Walgreens, etc.  Sorry, but don&#x27;t get your hopes up like I did.</li>
    <li> This product dries my hair out, though the gel does add a bit of shine and holds the curls/waves but its&#x27; stiff and tacky feeling.  The No-Poo just doesn&#x27;t seem to clean well. Maybe I&#x27;m old fashion.</li>
    <li> Love it. Does not weigh my curls down. I was using a product seen on infomercials, I do like, no suds either, but it weighs the curls down a bit. Will keep buying DevaCurl No-Poo. I am going to try more of there products.</li>
    <li> I almost didn&#x27;t order because so many people talked about the bad smell. But my hair needs help that badly!  For the past several years I&#x27;ve been using all natural shampoo and I sneeze if I even walk in the aisle of detergents at the store.  Not only was the smell not bad, I liked it!  It didn&#x27;t linger long either.  And I didnt sneeze or get stuffy.  Best of all, after two shampoos I can see some bounce, definition, and fun curl come back into my hair.</li>
