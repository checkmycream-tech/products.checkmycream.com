      <li>Thanks Shaun.</li>
      <li>say--\\&quot;you get what you pay for.\\&quot; -- and these were very inexpensive scissors.</li>

      <li>you groom dogs with scissors, I highly recommend this set.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t yet tried to sharpen them and they are marked as stainless (I assume steel).  </li>
      <li>AND THEY SAID THEY WERE A NEW PRODUCT...</li>
      <li>NEW Dog Pet Grooming Shear Scissor Set:4.5:5.5:6.5&amp;7.5\\&quot;]]</li>
      <li>thought that I&#x27;d surprise her with some new scissors.  </li>
      <li>One will be fine but the other will have to be sent out to have the blades fixed before it can be used</li>
      <li>Cheap, not worth paying shipping to return</li>
      <li>These scissors are so much more than I expected at such a low price.  </li>
      <li>Professional scissors are upwards of $150.  </li>
      <li>I wanted a sharp pair to groom my Papillon and was very sceptical when a whole group of scissors was offered at the price I paid.  </li>
      <li>Straight out of the box, these scissors are not sharp enough to cut my dog&#x27;s coat.</li>
      <li>She particularly likes the fact that you get four different size scissors in the set.  </li>
      <li>Decent enough.  </li>
      <li>But with the different sizes I can still do a decent job on my shih tzu.</li>
      <li>My only complaint would be that they are not very sharp, and do not take to sharpening very easily.</li>
      <li>I can barely wedge them in.</li>
      <li>One dog it cut easily, the other one i felt like the scissors needed to be a little sharper.</li>
      <li>The smaller scissors would make working around the face and feet a lot easier but the scissors are pretty stiff.</li>
      <li>Had a little trouble with the delivery but Shaun from vetmed quickly resolved the problem!</li>

<li> Sharp and professional, they do the trick.  </li>
<li> If you need to use them professionally on hair they are a bit dull.</li>
<li> it was rough and feels like there is metal not smoothed out,</li>
<li> don&#x27;t like to use my expensive scissors for trimming matts &amp; paws, so I recommend this set as the price is very reasonable.</li>
<li> I bought these a couple weeks ago and not one pair is even close to sharp or lined up to cut..total junk</li>
<li> Was not anything like my other one.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t expect much, but I did expect that they would cut hair at least for a while, but they are completely dull and won&#x27;t cut without pulling.  </li>
<li> well they were hard to open and close and at the end of them</li>
<li> I tried using these to groom my dogs &amp; had trouble as they aren&#x27;t as sharp as they should be.</li>
<li> The scissors are heavy, well ballanced and reasonably sharp.</li>
<li> Even tho they did cost  allot less.</li>
<li> You get 4 pair for less than what 1 pair would cost elsewhere.  </li>
<li> The scissors still were a little oily from manufacturing and there was a slight burr on one blade.  </li>
<li> I did make the mistake of telling her how little they cost.  </li>
<li> I took points off because the finish process was a little lax.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ll just stick with my professional grooming items even though they are expensive</li>
<li> the scissors are just too small for me to get my fingers into.</li>
<li> They are too dull to cut any type of dog fur.</li>

<li> Very Sharp!!!!</li>

    <li> These dog grooming scissors are wonderful.  You get 4 pair for less than what 1 pair would cost elsewhere.  The various sizes work for any job.  I bought these primarily for mat removal.  Sharp and professional, they do the trick.  I recommend these to any novice dog owner.</li>
    <li> Straight out of the box, these scissors are not sharp enough to cut my dog&#x27;s coat. I haven&#x27;t yet tried to sharpen them and they are marked as stainless (I assume steel).  The shape is right, but the sharpness of the blades are in question. I will see what happens once they are sharpened.  However, in the back of my mind I keep hearing my husband say--\\&quot;you get what you pay for.\\&quot; -- and these were very inexpensive scissors.</li>
    <li> These scissors are so much more than I expected at such a low price.  I wanted a sharp pair to groom my Papillon and was very sceptical when a whole group of scissors was offered at the price I paid.  What a great surprize that they are sharp and just what I was looking for. No, they are MORE than I was looking for.  Better get them while they last.</li>
    <li> Decent shears for the price</li>
    <li> Given the fact that it&#x27;s really cheap I don&#x27;t have too much to complain about.  Although, there isn&#x27;t much of a difference between the 6.5\\&quot; and the 7.5\\&quot; it seems like the handle is just longer and not the actual blades.  The smaller scissors would make working around the face and feet a lot easier but the scissors are pretty stiff.</li>
    <li> Professional scissors are upwards of $150.  What kind of quality could you possibly get for a set of four scissors for under $6?  Decent enough.  If I used the set ten times I would consider this an excellent bargain.  Top of the line?  Of course not.  Does it cut hair?  Indeed it does.  How they stand the test of time is another story, which can only be told after months on the job.  I have two Afghan Hounds that need maintenance cuts to keep hair out of their faces, etc.  This set does the trick for me.  And surprise, surprise, they&#x27;re not made in China!</li>
    <li> These are not the best cutting dog sheers  for sure...they look alot better then they cut...I would not buy these again..but you get what you pay for I guess</li>
    <li> I have used it to cut the dogs. One dog it cut easily, the other one i felt like the scissors needed to be a little sharper. My biggest gripe is i have big fingers (6 feet tall) and the scissors are just too small for me to get my fingers into. I can barely wedge them in.</li>
    <li> This set of shears are the perfect size for any job that needs to be done.  The only problem that I have with this purchase is that I was somewhat disappointed with the sharpness of the blades.  The different lengths make it possible to trim any area of your animal.  I have a pair of children&#x27;s scissors that are sharper than these.  But with the different sizes I can still do a decent job on my shih tzu.</li>
    <li> I ordered this one because I have the small rounded edge one for face trimming which is an exceptional scissor. These scissors are very sharp and work great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finish on the scissors was disappointing. Was not anything like my other one. I thought it was used so I returned it only to receive another that looked almost the same.  My son took the scissors and used his dremmel to polish it.  What a difference.  In spite of its appearance I still choose to give it five stars.  it cuts great and I like the blunt edge so I don&#x27;t risk hurting the dogs.</li>
    <li> I received this set promptly, it&#x27;s an excellent starter set. The scissors are heavy, well ballanced and reasonably sharp. I took points off because the finish process was a little lax.  The scissors still were a little oily from manufacturing and there was a slight burr on one blade.  I quickly solved that issue with my sharpening steel, and they work fine. For the home groomer and only occasional use, it&#x27;s perfect.  It&#x27;s by far the best value that I&#x27;ve seen out there.</li>
    <li> Will not believe what theh say! For one my sissors are not timpered ( the blades were not colored on the end like the pic, Two when i took a pair out and see how they felt_ well they were hard to open and close and at the end of them it was rough and feels like there is metal not smoothed out, Even tho they did cost  allot less. This is bull s***&#x27;</li>
    <li> For the money, these scissors were a reasonable buy. They are a decent weight, and they seem to be cast and hinged well. My only complaint would be that they are not very sharp, and do not take to sharpening very easily. It took me a while to get them to take an edge. If you are familiar with sharpening blades and are willing to sharpen these, they are a justifiable purchase.</li>
    <li> Terrible they don&#x27;t cut I even had 2 of them sharpened but still didn&#x27;t work&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again ever</li>
    <li> They were perfect for my wifes grooming</li>
    <li> Love having a matching set, super sharp and nice finish.</li>
    <li> .I don&#x27;t like to use my expensive scissors for trimming matts &amp; paws, so I recommend this set as the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> they look like they would do a better job but i guess for the money i payd i should not have expected more. If you need to use them professionally on hair they are a bit dull.</li>
    <li> Dog Pet Grooming Shear Scissor Sett&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I own and occasionally breed toy poodles.  My wife does all the grooming most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that I&#x27;d surprise her with some new scissors.  When these arrived yesterday, she immediately scooped up one of the toy poodles and went to trimming.  She particularly likes the fact that you get four different size scissors in the set.  I did make the mistake of telling her how little they cost.  I should have kept my mouth shut.  They are comparable to much more expensive scissors in the cutlery shops.  With what grooming costs around here they paid for themselves yesterd&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you groom dogs with scissors, I highly recommend this set.  I , also boughtt [[ASIN:B001IMDJ8O Tiny Dog Grooming Scissors Trims Safely @ Ears~Eyes]] she likes thaose as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gunner, 2010</li>
    <li> The product is a great deal. I&#x27;m not a professional - just grooming my own dog.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.  [[ASIN:B002IFRFLM NEW Dog Pet Grooming Shear Scissor Set:4.5:5.5:6.5&amp;7.5\\&quot;]]</li>
    <li> Love these shears! Love the price! Had a little trouble with the delivery but Shaun from vetmed quickly resolved the problem! Thanks Shaun.</li>
    <li> use them all the time</li>
    <li> THESE SCISSORS WERE VERY DULL, I NOTIFIED THE SELLER AND THEY SAID THEY WERE A NEW PRODUCT...I DISAGREE...OH WELL BASICALLY I WAS OVER THE 14 DAY PERIOD SO I COULD NOT RETURN THEM..</li>
    <li> I bought these a couple weeks ago and not one pair is even close to sharp or lined up to cut..total junk</li>
    <li> Cheap, not worth paying shipping to return</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product, good quality, the purchase was a success, is your estimated time came and ferfectas conditions. it is recommended</li>
    <li> Great little scissor set. Very Sharp!!!!</li>
    <li> Despite the good reviews, I wondered how such low priced scissors could be halfway decent quality. The answer is--they&#x27;re not. I didn&#x27;t expect much, but I did expect that they would cut hair at least for a while, but they are completely dull and won&#x27;t cut without pulling.  I should have known better. I can&#x27;t recommend these scissors for any purpose. They are too dull to cut any type of dog fur.</li>
    <li> Save your money !! I tried using these to groom my dogs &amp; had trouble as they aren&#x27;t as sharp as they should be. Plus the blades aren&#x27;t even but have a slight gap making it difficult to cut fur. I&#x27;ll end up using them around the house to cut paper or whatever else. I&#x27;ll just stick with my professional grooming items even though they are expensive but I can always sharpen them when I need to.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, the scissors are very good, their edge are very good. The fur of the pets are cut veri easy.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I purchased these. I had seen where some said they weren&#x27;t as sharp as needed but so far mine have worked great. I do plan on getting a sharpening stone but would need that with any shears I purchased to keep them nice and sharp. Love all the different sizes. Just what this home groomer needed to keep my dogs trimmed up nicely.</li>
    <li> 2 of them came with bent blades... One will be fine but the other will have to be sent out to have the blades fixed before it can be used</li>
