<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love this and the bonus sponge they include. It&#x27;s a great deal and an amazing product.  My skin feels so soft after using these. I have eczema especially in the winter and I am not sure if it&#x27;s the soap alone or the cloth because I use them together but it dramatically improved my outbreaks. Will definitely keep this on hand and with as long as a container last it should not be too difficult.</li>
    <li> I have only tried this once but it really did make my face feel very soft and&lt;br /&gt;clean without drying my skin. I will be ordering more for gifts.</li>
    <li> this is a holiday gift for my friend&lt;br /&gt;it arrived beautifully packaged and on time</li>
    <li> Great product. It leaves my skin really nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Love to be able to have an at-home turkish bath experience!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this item once since I&#x27;ve received it. It smells very nice, like Tree Tree Oil, but when I used it, I found that there is an after smell that&#x27;s going to take some getting used to. Also, the black color is kind of scary.</li>
    <li> Great product! The soap is like the black soap I used to buy in Morocco and the glove is very nice as well.</li>
    <li> Product arrived with no problems and on time. Nice packaging and I love the product!! Leaves a nice clean feeling and I already notice a difference in my skin. Will reorder!!</li>
    <li> The soap really makes my skin feel clean. I think it has helped my keratosis pilaris, but it hasn&#x27;t made it go away completely. I think overall it is a great product. It just seems a little work intensive in order to get the full effects out of the soap.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  First, it comes packaged beautifully - really, it&#x27;s ready to give as a gift just as it is. Before my order arrived I received a nice email from the vendor with instructions.  I tried it last night and, wow!  I always exfoliate in the shower so my skin is already pretty soft, but this takes it to a new level. I followed the instructions then lotioned-up afterwards and hopped into bed; my skin is baby-soft this morning. The mint and lavender fragrance is refreshing.  I&#x27;ll probably never get to Morocco to experience a real hammam, but I&#x27;m so glad this is available to me here.</li>
    <li> It was delivered. Have used it - smells great.</li>
    <li> Been regularly using moroccan soap when I was in the middle east and this product exactly does what I expect.</li>
    <li> Great transaction. was recommended by a friend from Morocco so I am sure it is a wonderful product. Update: I used it yesterday evening. Wonderful. I felt so good afterwards.</li>
    <li> kinda of sticky and it did not rinse completely</li>
    <li> I love this product n also I am impressed with Elbahya company satisfaction guaranty policy.  Give yourself a trial, U won&#x27;t b disappointed. U must follow exactly the instruction how to use it n u will get maximum amazing result. U don&#x27;t believe how much the dead cells come off. Yr skin  feel softer, nicer, n cleaner more than other brand bath gel.  Definitely I will recommend to my friends about this product. I ordered 5  more for family members. They all arrived. 1 of them is not in the  package as other 4.  I am disappointed of the unwrapped jar, but the Elbahya send immediately another  complete gift look so I can gift iy to my family. I still love it even almost a month passed,</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good . Will continue  to purchase :-)</li>
    <li> I love it...I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Very good product.</li>
    <li> Great, refreshing scent. Terrific texture. The glove is good quality and really exfoliates. Makes your own bathroom a Moroccan spa.</li>
    <li> I have been using Moroccan soap since I was 15. Living all my life in the Arabian region, I know how a Moroccan soap should and must be, and this fire sure high quality superb Moroccan soap. I live in the US now so I was worried of not getting what I expected, but this met my satisfaction and more. You will note smoother cleaner skin almost immediately. The hand gloves is excellent quality too</li>
    <li> my face has never been more clear! I have this now on my repeat to buy list</li>
    <li> I love the minty fresh smell if leaves on me. I use it all over. This is a must have if you love natural products. Leaves a silky smooth feeling on your skin.</li>
    <li> I love it! I have been using this product for a couple of weeks and my skin feels so smooth! Great cleanser and wonderful for exfoliating.</li>
    <li> I used the black soap my skin is smoother than it has felt in a long time. I recommend!! ^^</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I like that it came packaged for gift giving. Leaves your skin feeling new and smooth.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Leaves skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> This was a present for my youngest sister. She LOVES it! She has definitely noticed lovely softer skin. Her husband loves the softer skin, but was put off by the strong mediciney  scent. Sis says this will be her go to soap for giving herself a lift when she has been feeling bad or just needs a little me pampering.</li>
    <li> Amazing product for the skin. It makes my skin so soft and smooth. The natural ingrdients are amazing for my skin. I love the soft feel of my skin. The packaging is great. Read the instructions carefully and do what it says. And then see the amazing results.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend. She says it works and smells great!!</li>
    <li> love this soap! cleansed perfectly and exfoliated great! smells amazing! good price and with the glove got an extra great experience! highly recommend!  love the usda organic label!</li>
    <li> As described, extremely fast shipping. Love this product. It is very creamy and cleansing and made my face feel silky soft.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel..  I absolutely LOVE the glove....</li>
    <li> This product arrived very quickly and was packaged like a gift with a nice bow and a free exfoliating glove as well, which was a nice surprise.  I love this soap.  It is not a high lather soap as that is not what the Moroccan Black Soap is supposed to do.  It is a great soap that helps to remove impurities from the skin.  It leaves the skin feeling soft and silky.  I love the smell.  A minty but not overpowering minty smell. I am very happy with my purchase and do highly recommend this soap.</li>
    <li> Such a fabulous to product!!! Totally transforms my skin. So silky and smooth. I&#x27;m in love!! Must get on my beauty product list!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been several days since I have used this and I believe this product is amazing! It has a funky smell similar to noxzema and cleans just like it. It cleanses my skin without over-drying and for one dollar? This product is WORTH. I like the exfoliating glove that was given as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always a little skeptical when it comes to trying soaps and lotions that claim to make my skin soft as my skin seems determined to be rough and dry. When I ordered this I used it on my hands as a test to make sure I wouldn&#x27;t have any reaction and the difference was noticeable immediately after they dried. My hands really were soft as silk. I showed my boyfriend who is completely oblivious to practically everything and even he found himself rubbing his finger over my hand for five minutes straight saying, &amp;#34;Wow. That really is soft. What&#x27;s that soap again?&amp;#34; So seriously. It works. You should try it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It comes with a scrubber, where you put your hand in and gently scrub your skin. It makes your skin so super soft. I would definitely recommend this 😊</li>
    <li> This is by far one of my favorite purchases on amazon. The minute I opened my package I could smell something minty. It was wrapped very nicely and had a huge exfoliating glove. I am very familiar with black soap but only in bar and liquid form so I was SO surprised when I opened and saw this was like a gel. I used a very tiny amount for my whole body, this will last a while. As I waited the ten minutes for it to do it magic I relaxed with the scent of the Eucalyptus &amp; mint in the air. It was a great experience. Once I rinsed and got out I noticed a huge difference between this soap and the regular bar black soap. My skin wasn&#x27;t tight! I loved it, normally black soap leaves your skin tight and dry, but the texture of this one doesn&#x27;t. The scent lingers a little but not much. I&#x27;m so glad I got to try this. I received a discounted product for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Not much of anything, smelled good.  Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> If your looking for soemthing all natural that makes your skin silky smooth look no further! I have been using this product for a few weeks now and my skin is amazingly smooth. It also smells great, I am a very happy camper!</li>
    <li> Omg what a clean feeling with no residue...the scent is slightly medicinal but i Dont care, for one immediately feels refreshed and invigorated...customer service is professional friendly...shipping was a breeze...been using this product for a week and  really love it so i will be buying few more for Easter as gift since it has such a great presentation...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update...had the black soap foe a feww weeks now and all i can saw is i l.o.v.e it</li>
    <li> I like the feel and scent! Very different and I am enjoying it, nice packaging&lt;br /&gt;as well.</li>
    <li> This is a truly wonderful soap!!! It smells wonderful, but, more importantly, it does just what it says, cleanses and exfoliates so well...like a baby&#x27;s bottom! But, I have noticed due to high demand, I guess, that the price has risen substantially as of late, and I am concerned that, after loving it, I won&#x27;t be able to order on a more regular basis...Too bad, it is really special!!!</li>
    <li> If you are stopped up and you want to exfoliate your skin this is the product to buy. All kidding aside, this product is really good. I have used it a handful times and afterwards my skin just feels so smooth. I even used it on my heels, and it works wonders. The product does have a vicks smell so if you are stopped up, it will open you up.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this soap.  The application took some time but the results are worth it.  My legs have never been more soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Got it for my teenage daughter.  She loves it!  Works great on black heads.</li>
    <li> Prompt service. Item as described. Strong eucalyptus scent, great to wake you up in the morning.</li>
    <li> LIKE THE WAY THIS FEELS ON MY SKIN! ONLY BAD THING IS IT IS MESSY! BE CAREFUL WHEN GETTING IT OUT F THE JAR! I WOULD BUY THIS AGAIN! LOVE THE FRESH FEEL!</li>
    <li> I ordered this in response to a promotion advertised on Facebook. It is very nice cleanser. I actually like the medicinal scent (the way I used to like Noxema cleanser for the same reason). It does require quite a lot of rinsing to take off, but it takes every bit of dirt, oil and makeup off with it. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! I love this soap it has a wonderful smell and get the job done. It will remove all dead skin in one wash leaving your skin feeling squeaky clean and did I mention the company has the best customer service..... THANKS I WILL ORDER AGAIN</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my skin so smooth!!!! I use this let it soak and the scrub with a hand not scrubber and pumice stone in my feet! You will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed the soap.  It was stimulating, smelled great .</li>
    <li> Arrived super quick! Good quality product! Very good and effective  soap that cleans well and improved the softness of skin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Does not dry your skin.  I have very dry skin and I use it couple times a week.</li>
    <li> I love the refreshing smell of this soap.  After the very first use my skin felt smoother and softer.  I have really dry skin and I can tell already that this soap will really help combat the dryness.  After use there is no residue, just the feeling of clean, soft refreshed skin.</li>
    <li> Love how it makes my skin feel while scrubbing!  Great smell and easy to rinse off!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this black soap a few times before I left a review. The soap leaves my skin soft after each use and the smell opens up my sinuses in the shower.</li>
    <li> I only used it a couple times but I already see a difference. Really cleans out the pores.</li>
    <li> Personally, I think it smells strange. I also found it difficult to disperse onto skin due to the jello like consistency. It did make my skin feel soft and smooth but Im not sure if it was the product or the wonderful exfoliating glove that came with it.</li>
    <li> The soap STINKS! It smells like grease that&#x27;s being used in a car garage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it exfoliates really well!</li>
    <li> Did not like the smell.</li>
    <li> I have written to this company by email. This product is a scam..it&#x27;s deceptive ingredients and labeling. The ONLY thing in this junk was lavender oil. This so calked product and the company stand on their lies that everything and all the chemicals are natural. I used this product twice (very hesitantly) and boy I tell ya..my skin itch and pitched..almost scratched my skin off. There was nothing in this product that was natural but the lavender oil..the rest was just chemicals made in a lab. Whenever skin reacted to something, it&#x27;s ALWAYS, ALWAYS chemicals. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THUS CHEMICAL FAJE SOAP!!! IN FACT..ITS NOT SOAP AT ALL!!!</li>
    <li> I&lt;br /&gt;had a skin condition &amp; went to the Dermatologists for biopsy, it came back&lt;br /&gt;non-conclusive ($6400.00 answer for we don&#x27;t have a clue!!) needless to say I&lt;br /&gt;began my own research, this product did everything &amp; more for my skin &amp; w/ the&lt;br /&gt;moroccan dry oil, AMAZING results!!!! forget the face lifts twice a week &amp; dry&lt;br /&gt;oil daily , definitely will have people talking, &amp; asking for your&lt;br /&gt;secret</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a few weeks now in the shower, and I&#x27;m so happy to report that my skin looks 10 times clearer than I can ever remember it being. I&#x27;ve had issues with acne in a few places (not to get too graphic), and this soap has greatly helped all of those issues. It&#x27;s gentle, and my skin never feels dried out or abused like it can with some cheap drugstore soaps. Plus, this black soap smells great! I love using it, and recommend it to all my friends with skin problems</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time last night after receiving it and already my skin is softer than it has ever felt!  This product is a miracle.  My skin has been sooo dry for a long time and now I truly feel 20 years younger.  Thank you, Moroccan Black Soap for bring the life back to my skin.</li>
    <li> Love the way this made my skin feel. I am not one to put things I have never used on my face, and or body. But I tried a little bit of this and I feel in love with it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for my honest and unbiased review</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in LOVE with this product! It makes my skin feel soft and smell good. i have psorhiasis on my elbow, and after using this soap, the skin is no longer flaky and dry!  Amazing!</li>
    <li> This Black soap is awesome and is suitable for all skin types. It offers the skin a deep wash and purifies it by removing dirt and dead skin and leaves my skin looking radiant and beautiful. The soap makes the skin soft and silky smooth as it nourishes, exfoliates and moisturizes it. It come with a bonus Hammam Glove which is essential in exfoliating the skin. First, you use the soap to cleanse the skin and then you use the glove to exfoliating. My neck and face feels so smooth and clean and notice a lot fewer breakouts, and anticipate even better results with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I got this product for free or discounted price,  I ensure that my thoughts, ideas and words are indeed my own.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an all natural product to make your skin feel soft and like silk, you MUST purchase this Moroccan Black Soap.I was pleasantly surprised at the packing when it arrived. At first I thought someone had sent me a gift. I was wrapped in celofine with a hand mitt nicely wrapped with a cute brown bow, tying it all together.  I have been using mine for over two weeks and my skin feels as soft and smooth as a newborn baby&#x27;s skin. I love using it during my morning showers because the smell of the Eucalyptus is invigorating and wakes up my senses for the day. I was able to test this product during a promotion, for my unbiased opinion, and I am glad I did because when my jar starts to get low, I will for sure be purchasing more for myself. I am also going to purchase a few more for some gifts to a few of my friends. I know that I can have it shipped directly to them because of the cute packing. This will say me time, and the aggravation of having to &amp;#34;wrap&amp;#34; it to present it to them. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product, order your own today. I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This cleanser and the mitt are amazing and provide smooth clear skin afterwards. I highly recommend this product to anyone wishing to have younger smoother skin in one shower!</li>
    <li> I had never used black soap before and was very excited to try this product. It is very refreshing both to the skin and to smell. It lathers very well and leaves your skin feeling clean and smooth. The glove is a must have item. It really helps invigorate the skin. The jar seems like it will last quite awhile, being you only need to use a small amount. Another big plus is that this is natural and organic. I recommend trying this black soap. I am so glad I did.</li>
    <li> This product arrived with a nice exfoliating glove attached. It was wrapped very nicely as if it was a gift ready to go into a gift bag. I washed my face with this to start with and love the smoothness it left. It also did not break out my skin as some products do. The smell was a clean eucalyptus type of smell. I then drew a bath and bathed my whole body in this and I now have an allover smoothness that I just love....and so does my other half. :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Makes my skin super smooth. Love it!</li>
    <li> It was a gift so I did not try it to say anything more</li>
    <li> I love this soap. Smells good. Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Great quality product! Thank you very much for the free glove also : )  they work together amazingly well...</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter.  She has been using it for about a week and really likes it. She says that it makes her skin very soft and smooth, and she really loves the fresh scent.  It is wonderful to know that this product is natural and organic so there is no worry about harsh and dangerous chemicals on her skin.</li>
    <li> it does make your skin very smooth, but it smells really, really medicinal</li>
    <li> If you eat organic, you should really look into organic skin products as well. I don&#x27;t like using harsh crazy chemicals to &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; my skin. I am so happy this black soap is organic. You don&#x27;t need those chemicals for a great soap, that leaves your skin silky smooth. After just 2 showers my skin is clearer and I even have a little shimmer to my skin!! My daughter vis 9 and was having major dry skin patches from being outside all summer. She is loving this soap! We are happy customers.</li>
    <li> The item was delivered in a very timely manner and I am enjoying it. I&#x27;ll probably come back to purchase more for gifts. Thank you.</li>
