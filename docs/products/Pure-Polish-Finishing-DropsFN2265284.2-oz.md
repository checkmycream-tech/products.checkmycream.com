      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I have been using pure polish for years.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care for the scent so much -</li>
      <li>Too much feels really greasy, as does using it on your roots.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really frizzy if I don&#x27;t put any product in it after I wash it.</li>
      <li>Too much</li>
      <li>or I just don&#x27;t like my frizzy part curly part straight hair.</li>
      <li>It really minimizes frizz and works well with curly hair.</li>
      <li>Also was good to use at the ocean to pull my hair back into a pony and know that when it got wet from ocean or pool water it would have some protection.</li>
      <li>I have to be honest though, this is actually my second choice of hair product though next to Surface Bassu Gold.</li>
      <li>I have long, thin, wavy hair, but not the kind with a nice wave to it.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone using this type of drops.</li>
      <li>This is a good product, a little bit goes a long way, so the bottle lasts forever.  </li>
      <li>I love both of them, but prefer Bassu first, then this one secondary.</li>
      <li>You use so little, it smells so fresh and clean, and my hair is so touchably soft.  </li>
      <li>but her new bottles.</li>
      <li>My hair smells so yummy and looks so shiny and soft!</li>
      <li>and it leaves your hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>i use this on my 11 year old&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>Product gets the job done and leaves my hair shiny and soft, not to mention it smells like candy.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and my hair adores this stuff.</li>
      <li>This stuff makes my hair so silky soft</li>
      <li>I had naturally curly hair.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or leave it super greasy.  </li>
      <li>her hair is straight, full, and thick.  </li>
      <li>These are a bit heavy for me to use on dry hair, but have found most helpful to put on my ends when damp before using the hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>My hair actually feels soft with these drops.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a good product, a little bit goes a long way, so the bottle lasts forever.  Its great when you travel, put a dab on your hands and run it through your hair and its more manageable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years. Used to pay a lot more, as I got it at high-end hair salons. So I was really happy to find it for a lower price on Amazon. I have thick hair that tends to get somewhat frizzy. These finishing drops tame the hair, make it really soft and smooth, and smell great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 7 years.  It was recommended to me after I tried to color my own hair and damaged it badly.  This helped me grow it out without having to chop it all off and I have used it continually since.  My hair is color treated and long.  This keeps it from frizzing and helps it to look healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite styling products. I have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> The first time.  Then they didn&#x27;t carry it anymore.  I&#x27;m so glad to find on Amazon!  Love this stuff.  You use so little, it smells so fresh and clean, and my hair is so touchably soft.  I have natural kind of frizzy waves, and this stuff smooths it out.  I love it so much!!!!</li>
    <li> Not only is this product awesome, but it smells so delicious.  I also use the shine mist which is equally as great. Eufora really makes great products.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product with an incredible orange citrus smell. Works wonders to tame my thick curly hair and makes it very soft.</li>
    <li> Best product I have found to calm down my frizzy curly hair. My hair actually feels soft with these drops.</li>
    <li> I love it!  My hair can get kind of frizzy.  Now I can shampoo, towel dry, add a bit of beautifying serum and the finishing drops.  I rub it all in and style my hair and let it air dry.  So easy. A quick comb in 20 minutes and I am good to go.  It seems to seal my hair and keep it from frizzing. I don&#x27;t know if it would work with blow drys, because I have never tried it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the scent so much - UNTIL I mix it with Eufora Beautifying Serum for Hair Skin and Scalp!!!!  Smells AMAZING together, makes my hair SHINE, smooth, and sounds clique&#x27;, but silky too!  LOVE these 2 together!</li>
    <li> this is the best! makes my hair shine, smell and just all around look amazing. LOVE</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair nice and shiny, and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> works fantastic on my type of hair.  Yeah</li>
    <li> I have used this eufora product for about 4 years now. This is my favorite product they offer. It smeels incredible! I add a dime sized drop to my palms after drying and styling my hair, starting at the ends and working about half way up. Too much feels really greasy, as does using it on your roots. It adds great shine, and smooths the ends of my hair which tend to get frizzy if I dont flat iron them with every styling. One bottle will last me at least a year (and my hair is thick, waist length). I use it every other day (I try to wash my hair only every 2 days to keep from drying/damaging it).</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. A tad spendy, but Eufora has great stuff. Product gets the job done and leaves my hair shiny and soft, not to mention it smells like candy. I get compliments regularly. However, only a LITTLE will get the job done. Too much and you can be left looking and feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It was introduced to me while I was visiting a spa in California! I had to have more!</li>
    <li> This stuff is Awsome. I am an avid eufora user and I have to say that I am so happy my stylist told me to purchase this product. This stuff makes my hair so silky soft I absolutly LOVE IT!!!!! I use the eufora leave in conditioner daily and I also mix it with the polish finishing drops. My hair smells so yummy and looks so shiny and soft! It really is a great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using pure polish for years. If I am in a beauty shop that does not use the product,I bring it along. All beauticians love it also. It has a light feel,holds the hair,has a lovely ,not overwhelming fragrance and adds fabulous shine.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I had naturally curly hair.  I use this when I choose to straighten my hair.  I put a few drops on my hair after it&#x27;s straight. It keeps away the frizz and makes it shiny.  It also smells amazing.  Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey but it lasts a long time so it all works out.  Make the investment!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister, when she unwrapped the gift &amp; went to use it the next day the smell from the product was really bad, like the smell of oil gone bad she opened the other bottle and it was the same bad smell; like the product was old or had been stored in a hot place.  So she threw them out, that was $50 down the drain, and I had to but her new bottles.</li>
    <li> As Described, Delivered On Time, Well Packaged, Very Satisfied,  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great product. Ihave used it for approximately one year prior to this order. I would highly recommend it to anyone using this type of drops.</li>
    <li> My frizzy out of control hair loves this product.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or leave it super greasy.  I have to use it every day or I just don&#x27;t like my frizzy part curly part straight hair.</li>
    <li> I love Eufora products!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive used lots of anti-frizz products such as moroccan oil, but those products have always made my hair greasy looking and have just weighed my hair down. I have long, thin, wavy hair, but not the kind with a nice wave to it. It&#x27;s really frizzy if I don&#x27;t put any product in it after I wash it. This product works well for me and is really good for my type of hair. I love it. I have to be honest though, this is actually my second choice of hair product though next to Surface Bassu Gold. I love both of them, but prefer Bassu first, then this one secondary. But really really love this product just as much, which is why I give it 5 stars. This product is also a little easier to find than the Bassu one too.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It really minimizes frizz and works well with curly hair. My only complaint is the fact that it is rather difficult to find unless you go to a salon that has it. That said, yay for Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> i use this on my 11 year old&#x27;s hair. her hair is straight, full, and thick.  we have actually had it thinned twice and could probably do so again.  i put just a drop or two on the bottom half of her hair and it keeps it from \\&quot;poofing\\&quot; or turning into a \\&quot;rats nest\\&quot; by the end of the school day.</li>
    <li> These are a bit heavy for me to use on dry hair, but have found most helpful to put on my ends when damp before using the hair dryer.  Also was good to use at the ocean to pull my hair back into a pony and know that when it got wet from ocean or pool water it would have some protection. But, not sure if I&#x27;ll buy again.  Have been using for about a month. Does smell great though!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  Smells great and does wonders for my hair.  A friend told me about this. like it.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product for years and love it. There is nothing like it. It is a cross between a moisturizer and a styling gel and it leaves your hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Ive been using Eufora for years and I absolutely love it. I wish it was a little less expensive just because I use it so often. The whole product line is perfect. And just a side note. I have naturally curly hair and my hair adores this stuff. Just FYI. ;)</li>
    <li> This product is very light but also moisturizes very well.  I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year now and absolutely love it.</li>
