### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wife loved them !!</li>
      <li>so it worked out perfectly!</li>
      <li>so if you want a great product for the money this is it.</li>
      <li>The timing was great</li>
      <li>The price was great though.</li>
      <li>but over all it is a good value for the money</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t very satisfied with the product when i received it.</li>
      <li>The variety is amazing</li>
      <li>Love this product also good pricing.</li>
      <li>Otherwise a nice amount..</li>
      <li>One of my best internet purchases, HIGHLY recommended.</li>
      <li>And like most acrylic body jewelry the balls strip out or crack very easily.</li>
      <li>There were quite a lot of duplicates, and most of them consisted of three of each.</li>
      <li>Out of 100 belly button rings I had one duplicate and it was my favorite one</li>
      <li>I have my top &amp; bottom belly button pierced</li>
      <li>I just received these yesterday, I got so many cute colors and combinations.</li>
      <li>Cute designs though.</li>
      <li>Excellent buy definitely going to recommend this to everyone.</li>
      <li>Love them, you get a lot of doubles</li>
      <li>Satisfied with the product and came in a timely manner</li>
      <li>Fast shipping great quality.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m fine with it, should have better design</li>
      <li>They arrived fast and in good condition.</li>
      <li>There was a large variety and some duplicates which are always nice</li>
      <li>The price was awesome, but i didn&#x27;t like paying for ten of the same kind of patterns.</li>
      <li>There was to many of the same ones, i loved the deal.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t count how many I received but it looked to be the right amount.</li>
      <li>One good thing was I received the order pretty fast.</li>
      <li>DEFINITELY worth the price!</li>
      <li>I was so thrilled when the package came early.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like someone just grabbed a hand full and counted out 100.</li>
      <li>They where cute and easy to insert when i counted them their was one number less than was advertised overall very pleased</li>
      <li>Anyway it&#x27;s a great deal if you&#x27;re like me and prone to losing the small pieces.</li>
      <li>I consider it lucky that it was my favorite one that had all of the multiples, because hey it really sucks to lose the smaller ball and not be able to wear that one anymore because you want the top and bottom ball to match.</li>
      <li>there was so many that were the same!</li>
      <li>there was a large assortment of belly button rings but there were alot of duplicate colors</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t like this at all.</li>
      <li>VERY PISSED</li>
      <li>I purchase 100 of these from another company, for a gift as these were to be, and not one duplicate in the whole 100 pieces.</li>
      <li>It should have been clear that most of them were the same!</li>
      <li>so the colors definitely make cool looking combinations.</li>
      <li>I got within a week from ordering, but these bulk of rings have too many of the same I have 10 blue belly rings</li>
      <li>A lot of the belly button rings were missing either the top ball or the bottom ball.</li>
      <li>I instantly found several patterns I liked, and lots of sparkly blue ones.</li>
      <li>I got a few sparkled ones and some clear ones which are very cool.</li>
      <li>But, in the long run I would have chosen the other package on here to get, that from the reviews on it contained no duplicates for just a few more dollars.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They arrived at the time they were supposed to, although these belly button rings are not 14 gauge. Cute designs though. Wish they were 14 gauge.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with the product and came in a timely manner</li>
    <li> Other reviews said that it came with a lot of duplicates. Out of 100 belly button rings I had one duplicate and it was my favorite one so it worked out perfectly! Excellent buy definitely going to recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Wife loved them !! Would recommend them to anyone! The variety is amazing so if you want a great product for the money this is it.</li>
    <li> DEFINITELY worth the price! Love them, you get a lot of doubles but if you ever lose a ball or one breaks, you have a back-up!</li>
    <li> All the belly rings had similar designs, colors, and patterns. Otherwise a nice amount.. I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase and now addicted to belly button rings!</li>
    <li> I was so thrilled when the package came early. I instantly found several patterns I liked, and lots of sparkly blue ones. Then I started going through them and found I had duplicates everywhere! One design I&lt;br /&gt; have 7 of the same one. Not that big of an issue though, when you remember that they are acrylic and do break. I consider it lucky that it was my favorite one that had all of the multiples, because hey it really sucks to lose the smaller ball and not be able to wear that one anymore because you want the top and bottom ball to match. Anyway it&#x27;s a great deal if you&#x27;re like me and prone to losing the small pieces.</li>
    <li> THE QUALITY SUCKS AND THEY ARE TONS OF DUPLICATES. I HAVE 7 OF THE SAME PINK AND BLACK INFINITY RING. THESE ARE HORRIBLE. VERY PISSED</li>
    <li> There was a large variety and some duplicates which are always nice incase some break. Love this product also good pricing.</li>
    <li> There was to many of the same ones, i loved the deal. The price was awesome, but i didn&#x27;t like paying for ten of the same kind of patterns.</li>
    <li> Only 16 out of the 100 were individual. All the rest were duplicates. There was one style that I received 11 of them the same. Several were just plain colors with no design on them what so ever. They arrived fast and in good condition. My disappointment lies in the fact that they said some would be duplicate, not most.  I purchase 100 of these from another company, for a gift as these were to be, and not one duplicate in the whole 100 pieces.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for myself figuring the duplicates I could just share with friends ! The timing was great I got within a week from ordering, but these bulk of rings have too many of the same I have 10 blue belly rings -_- it&#x27;s annoying</li>
    <li> A lot of the belly button rings were missing either the top ball or the bottom ball. And like most acrylic body jewelry the balls strip out or crack very easily. The price was great though.</li>
    <li> They where cute and easy to insert when i counted them their was one number less than was advertised overall very pleased</li>
    <li> there was so many that were the same! and not very cuteee :/ some were alright looking !&lt;br /&gt;xoxox - Emilee</li>
    <li> Lots of duplicates but I&#x27;m fine with it, should have better design</li>
    <li> I just received these yesterday, I got so many cute colors and combinations. I have my top &amp; bottom belly button pierced so the colors definitely make cool looking combinations. I got very few that I know I won&#x27;t wear. I got a few sparkled ones and some clear ones which are very cool. One of my best internet purchases, HIGHLY recommended.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this at all. I got ten of the same jewelry. It&#x27;s like someone just grabbed a hand full and counted out 100. They need to be sorted out so we don&#x27;t get 5 of the same one.</li>
    <li> There were quite a lot of duplicates, and most of them consisted of three of each. I didn&#x27;t count how many I received but it looked to be the right amount. One good thing was I received the order pretty fast. But, in the long run I would have chosen the other package on here to get, that from the reviews on it contained no duplicates for just a few more dollars.</li>
    <li> It should have been clear that most of them were the same! I wasn&#x27;t very satisfied with the product when i received it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great quality. Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> there was a large assortment of belly button rings but there were alot of duplicate colors but over all it is a good value for the money</li>
