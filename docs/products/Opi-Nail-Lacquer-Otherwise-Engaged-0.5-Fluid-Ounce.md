      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This is my FAVORITE OPI color.  </li>
      <li>Love the name.</li>
      <li>I am wondering if this is authentic OPI polish.</li>
      <li>Great for &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; use and just having your nails have a natural look.</li>

      <li>Great everyday color.</li>
      <li>Opi polish is always worth the price.</li>
      <li>Very natural easy to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light pink with a minor, beautiful sheen to it.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so pretty</li>
      <li>It gives s super smooth finish, you don&#x27;t even need topcoat (though I always use it anyways for extra shine).</li>
      <li>I love this color especially for my fingernails when I don&#x27;t really want to wear brighter and darker colors.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise engaged is a great basic colour and can be layered for a different look with a shiney colour or a clear polish with sparkles in it.</li>
      <li>The polish is slightly pearlized which also adds a nice touch.</li>
      <li>It has a hint of pink, but mostly just a nice, staying-power protection for nails that need a little help for strength.</li>
      <li>Everyone wants to know the name.</li>
      <li>This is my new go-to color!</li>
      <li>A very professional look.</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a shade of light pink for years that would cover in 2 coats looking sheer and natural.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so natural looking</li>
      <li>Otherwise Engaged was nowhere near the color it should be.</li>
      <li>It would be a nice nude if I had pale skin, but as I do not, it looks highlighter pink.</li>
      <li>Love this color!...very subtle.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sort of like the OPI sweetheart polish, but its more pink and not as dull.</li>
      <li>It is a step or two up from clear polish with a hint of pink.</li>

<li> It is a step or two up from clear polish with a hint of pink.</li>
<li> There is subtle iridescence, but not too much to make it unwearable for a conservative every day look.</li>
<li> It looks a bit like a french manicure without the harsh (IMHO) white line.</li>
<li> It is very similar to a French manicure subtle pink!</li>
<li> It is not 100% the tone color as in the picture (but close...), + it has dark pink Pearlescent, wich I didn&#x27;t expect.</li>
<li> Was not exactly the color that I was expecting.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a pearly color with a slight pink tint.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t look like it in it&#x27;s picture, but this nail polish has a sheen to it when applied so it won&#x27;t just appear as this pale pink color.</li>
<li> that it&#x27;s hardly noticeable when my nails start to grow out or the color begins to chip.</li>

    <li> Opi Otherwise engaged is a great basic colour and can be layered for a different look with a shiney colour or a clear polish with sparkles in it. Opi is consistantly a good product for your nails.</li>
    <li> Wow. I have been looking for a shade of light pink for years that would cover in 2 coats looking sheer and natural. This color is beautiful with just a hint of shimmer. It&#x27;s so natural looking that it&#x27;s hardly noticeable when my nails start to grow out or the color begins to chip. This is my new go-to color!</li>
    <li> Super pretty color! It&#x27;s a light pink with a minor, beautiful sheen to it. It&#x27;s sort of like the OPI sweetheart polish, but its more pink and not as dull. This is a staple in any nail polish collection!</li>
    <li> This is perfect.  I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.  Everyone wants to know the name. It is a step or two up from clear polish with a hint of pink.</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE OPI color.  It goes on without streaks and is nice and light.  A very professional look.</li>
    <li> This color is very nice. When looking at bottle, you can see holographic orange/peach, but it doesn&#x27;t show up when painted on nails.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this color! I have several different bottles of it and it is just a beautiful color of nail polish!</li>
    <li> The color on this bottle of OPI Otherwise Engaged was nowhere near the color it should be. I have a bottle that I purchased at the store, and they are totally different. I am wondering if this is authentic OPI polish.</li>
    <li> Perfect polish and arrived fast.</li>
    <li> It is not 100% the tone color as in the picture (but close...), + it has dark pink Pearlescent, wich I didn&#x27;t expect. But I like it, I am fine with it.</li>

    <li> Love this color! It is very similar to a French manicure subtle pink! Doesn&#x27;t chip either. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this color!...very subtle.</li>
    <li> I never get color on my fingernails. I prefer to leave them natural but this color is GORGEOUS. Even the manicurist said how beautiful it is. It looks a bit like a french manicure without the harsh (IMHO) white line.</li>

It gives s super smooth finish, you don&#x27;t even need topcoat (though I always use it anyways for extra shine). There is subtle iridescence, but not too much to make it unwearable for a conservative every day look. Love the false/french  tip look you get with two thicker coats.</li>
    <li> My daughter came over wearing this and it&#x27;s so pretty I had to get some of my own. Great for when your feeling innocent and feminine.</li>
    <li> Love it. Easy to apply on own. I totally recommend it. Go and get it now. Great everyday color. Love the name.</li>

    <li> Very natural easy to use.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous opalescent color. Received from seller within days.</li>
    <li> Love OPI nail polish!  Wears great! Color last without chipping. Excellent price on product. Opi polish is always worth the price.</li>
    <li> It would be a nice nude if I had pale skin, but as I do not, it looks highlighter pink.</li>
