      <li>Absolutely adorable bottle!</li>
      <li>I love this perfume!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s just too damn adorable that the stem on the &#x27;fobidden apple&#x27; is where the perfume sprays out!</li>
      <li>Its really amazing, when I wear Lolita &lt;br /&gt;parfum</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great fragrance, it doesn&#x27;t wear off quickly</li>
      <li>I like it, but it is VERY sweet and VERY strong.  </li>
      <li>Cause from the male side of it, its literally the best fragrance I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure to smell on a woman.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite perfumes.  </li>
      <li>I am in heaven:)</li>
      <li>This is one of my all-time favorite scents.</li>
      <li>This perfume is top of the line.</li>
      <li>Cute bottle, too--best</li>
      <li>More please, Lolita.</li>
      <li>Now i&#x27;m a guy, but I buy this for my best friend back home whenever she runs out.</li>
      <li>I got her Lolita from Amazon after she fell in love with a Sephora sample.  </li>
      <li>If you like sweet smelling very strong perfumes ..youll love this one.</li>
      <li>This perfume isn&#x27;t comparible to anything - finally a totally unique scent!</li>
      <li>I love this perfume soo much!!!</li>
      <li>It is a strong smell, so go easy on it.</li>
      <li>Lolita Lempicka is strong, distinctive and aggressive...</li>
      <li>This scent elicits some strong reactions.</li>
      <li>It is very unique and the scent has a &#x27;rich quality&#x27; to it.  </li>
      <li>Innocent and sweet...  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sweet and sexy, and the scent changes with you.</li>
      <li>beautiful but different..  </li>
      <li>For me the best aspect of this fragrance is the slight licorice undertone, which gives it an edge I haven&#x27;t come across in another fragrance.</li>
      <li>Its the kind that last strong all day, the kind that lasts on your clothes after you wash your clothes.</li>
      <li>a sweetness of flowers... with a light element of must and violets.</li>
      <li>lol, different, but it adds a personality-concept to my perfume collection, which I like...</li>
      <li>I wanted to make sure she loved it, so I gave back all 3 because they weren&#x27;t her style.  </li>
      <li>I have worn Lolita for many years,  and everyone always wants to know what I am wearing because they love it.  </li>
      <li>I notice the scent changes more as the day wears on which I love because it only gets better.  </li>
      <li>But I was too excited to get this, and yes I bought this solely based on reviews and had NEVER smelt it before (to my knowledge).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a girly, sweet, luscious smell.  </li>
      <li>It smells light and fresh.  </li>
      <li>It goes from sweet SYRUPY-VIOLET, to a SPICY-GREEN scent, to an almost, but not quite, POWDERY BLACK-LICORICE.     </li>
      <li>Will definitely be stocking up on many more bottles very soon!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell at first reminded me of sweet grapes...when I sprayed it on my skin, but then it adherents to your chemistry and becomes like a sweet nectar or a heighten touch of vanilla...</li>
      <li>I just got it today, first the bottle is unique, like an apple the apple stem has an opening where the spray is, I thought it was a cap...</li>
      <li>This scent is delightfully soft and elegant, I usually wear Lolita and the bottle is beautiful</li>
      <li>It is strong which i love and it lasts a real long time.</li>
      <li>The scent made an incredible impression on me,  but apparently on the other people that have been in my life as well.</li>
      <li>If you want to try something new, give this a go and at $30 with free shipping (which i got)</li>
      <li>loved\\&quot; because they want to buy it for their new significant others.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re too pretty to get rid of.</li>
      <li>;D</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t imagine someone smelling this on me and not wanting to know exactly what I&#x27;m wearing and where to purchase it.</li>
      <li>I can smell the floral first, then the ivy, then the musk...</li>
      <li>/&gt;---OveRall---&lt;br /&gt;The strength is more of a sweet vanilla touch to it, the scent I would say last maybe more than a few hours and just dissipates down more after that..which is cool with me...</li>
      <li>So my nose was pretty much non-functional.</li>
      <li>I have to be in a certain \\&quot;mood\\&quot; to wear this one, but..</li>
      <li>I wish I got the bigger bottle, I can see myself using this up quite quick!</li>
      <li>Sexy, young, VERY sweet..a little bit overbearing if not applied with a light touch.</li>
      <li>The scent seems to change as the day goes on, I really like it.</li>
      <li>I have had this for many years, lasts a long time and doesnt seem to get that old smell even after five years.  </li>
      <li>Now this is the only perfume in which I have understood the meaning of &#x27;top&#x27;, &#x27;middle&#x27;, and &#x27;bottom&#x27; notes.  </li>
      <li>If you love dark fairy tales and you like deep, rich fragrances that last but are not overpowering, this is for you.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking to try something new and are picky about perfume, try this one.  </li>
      <li>down to the scent, the intricately detailed bottle</li>
      <li>This fragrance is strong and enveloping, but not overwhelming (if used SPARINGLY)...such a distinctive scent, with yummy anise/licorice overtones and floral undertones...</li>
      <li>I had been wanting to use a new fragrance as i really only wear 3 perfumes, 1 of which is basically empty.</li>

    <li> The day FedEx delivered this I was still recovering from a bad cold. So my nose was pretty much non-functional. But I was too excited to get this, and yes I bought this solely based on reviews and had NEVER smelt it before (to my knowledge). I had been wanting to use a new fragrance as i really only wear 3 perfumes, 1 of which is basically empty. So this was a leap of faith. However I knew that even if i didn&#x27;t like it i could use it as decorative feature in my place that wouldn&#x27;t go unnoticed. Anyways - open the box and i was very surprised at how small the little apple was. I suppose because i know the 3.4 oz retails for like $85 in department stores/Sephora, etc I expected a larger size. So i was definitely comforted knowing i only spent $30 on the tester. It didn&#x27;t come with the branded box, and to my knowledge that&#x27;s all it lacked. (big deal) The perfume is quite suiting for me. My family seemed to adore it, guys and girls alike. If you want to try something new, give this a go and at $30 with free shipping (which i got) i couldn&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> This scent is delightfully soft and elegant, I usually wear Lolita and the bottle is beautiful ýtoo. ý</li>
    <li> I love this perfume soo much!!! It smells so good and makes me feel so sexy!! It is strong which i love and it lasts a real long time. It doesn&#x27;t ware off like other perfumes. Apply a small amount before going out and I guarantee you will receive complements!</li>
    <li> This perfume is top of the line. If you like sweet smelling very strong perfumes ..youll love this one. Its the kind that last strong all day, the kind that lasts on your clothes after you wash your clothes.</li>
    <li> I just got it today, first the bottle is unique, like an apple the apple stem has an opening where the spray is, I thought it was a cap...lol, different, but it adds a personality-concept to my perfume collection, which I like...diversity.&lt;br /&gt;The smell at first reminded me of sweet grapes...when I sprayed it on my skin, but then it adherents to your chemistry and becomes like a sweet nectar or a heighten touch of vanilla... a sweetness of flowers... with a light element of must and violets. I truly like the uniqueness to it.&lt;br /&gt;---OveRall---&lt;br /&gt;The strength is more of a sweet vanilla touch to it, the scent I would say last maybe more than a few hours and just dissipates down more after that..which is cool with me...it&#x27;s overall a keeper in my book.&lt;br /&gt;-Let&#x27;s just say it does it&#x27;s job..to be enchanting.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes.  I love anything vanilla and this has a great combination of it with violets, musk and iris.  It is a strong smell, so go easy on it. One spray lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I just received my bottle of Lolita Lempicka and had to spray a bit on my wrist IMMEDIATELY. OMG!!! This fragrance is strong and enveloping, but not overwhelming (if used SPARINGLY)...such a distinctive scent, with yummy anise/licorice overtones and floral undertones...I can&#x27;t imagine someone smelling this on me and not wanting to know exactly what I&#x27;m wearing and where to purchase it. Lolita Lempicka is strong, distinctive and aggressive...just like me...LOVE IT!!! Will definitely be stocking up on many more bottles very soon!!</li>
    <li> This perfume isn&#x27;t comparible to anything - finally a totally unique scent! It&#x27;s sweet and sexy, and the scent changes with you. I&#x27;m addicted to it. So are the men! ;D</li>
    <li> This is one of my all-time favorite scents. If you love dark fairy tales and you like deep, rich fragrances that last but are not overpowering, this is for you. Wearing this is like entering a shimmery gothic dream. For me the best aspect of this fragrance is the slight licorice undertone, which gives it an edge I haven&#x27;t come across in another fragrance. And did I mention it&#x27;s romantic? Just look at the amethyst and gold apple bottle! They&#x27;re too pretty to get rid of.</li>
    <li> I bought my mom 3 perfumes from Sephora.  Two of them were over $100 each.  I wanted to make sure she loved it, so I gave back all 3 because they weren&#x27;t her style.  I got her Lolita from Amazon after she fell in love with a Sephora sample.  It smells light and fresh.  It&#x27;s a beautiful scent in a lovely bottle.  She had a very happy Mother&#x27;s Day.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells so unique--it&#x27;s the perfect perfume to pick if you&#x27;re looking that oh-so amazing scent that will stand out from the crowd and cause people to think of you whenever they smell it. It&#x27;s a head turner; it changes too as you wear it,     It goes from sweet SYRUPY-VIOLET, to a SPICY-GREEN scent, to an almost, but not quite, POWDERY BLACK-LICORICE.     It interchanges between those three scents, sometimes smelling like all three, just two, and sometimes smelling like just one---it&#x27;s very interesting :D it likes to morph</li>
    <li> Now i&#x27;m a guy, but I buy this for my best friend back home whenever she runs out. Why? Cause from the male side of it, its literally the best fragrance I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure to smell on a woman. And once you&#x27;ve experinced this smell guys, you&#x27;ll never forget it. So don&#x27;t waste time and go spend the cash and by your girl this gift.</li>
    <li> I have worn Lolita for many years,  and everyone always wants to know what I am wearing because they love it.  I have had 2 X-boyfriends, that I am still friends with, tell me they have never forgotten the smell of my perfume.  One of these guys dates back to college and I have been outta there for 8 years now.  I broke down and told them the name of  \\&quot; that smell they loved\\&quot; because they want to buy it for their new significant others.  The scent made an incredible impression on me,  but apparently on the other people that have been in my life as well. The scent is dark, seductive, and delicate at the same time.  I notice the scent changes more as the day wears on which I love because it only gets better.  I am told this is called the dry down phase.  Of course I am no professional perfumer,  but out of my collection of scents,  this one is my Annie Hall.... beautiful but different..  and not to be missed.</li>
    <li> Sexy, young, VERY sweet..a little bit overbearing if not applied with a light touch. A little goes a long way. Absolutely adorable bottle! ( definitely one you don&#x27;t throw away)  To me this scent is best described as \\&quot; cotton candy with an attitude!\\&quot; I have to be in a certain \\&quot;mood\\&quot; to wear this one, but..it IS one of my favorites!</li>
    <li> I like it, but it is VERY sweet and VERY strong.  Cute bottle, too--best I have seen in ages.  Probably should be worn by younger (than I) women and not if they are going to be riding in a plane or an elevator.  This scent elicits some strong reactions.</li>
    <li> This is the best scent ever I been wearing it since it came out,I also been giving it for Cristmas, Everybody loves it, is sweet,clean and it last all day and the scent wont change on you,of course the scent change on every person.LOVE IT and keep on buying it, The Perfect Scent.</li>
    <li> The scent is just as attractive as the bottle it comes in.  It&#x27;s a girly, sweet, luscious smell.  Doesn&#x27;t have the yucky alcohol smell some perfumes have.    I wish I got the bigger bottle, I can see myself using this up quite quick!</li>
    <li> I have had this for many years, lasts a long time and doesnt seem to get that old smell even after five years.  It is very unique and the scent has a &#x27;rich quality&#x27; to it.  The scent seems to change as the day goes on, I really like it.</li>
    <li> Okay, I adore this perfum!!! down to the scent, the intricately detailed bottle and it&#x27;s just too damn adorable that the stem on the &#x27;fobidden apple&#x27; is where the perfume sprays out! hah! If you&#x27;re looking to try something new and are picky about perfume, try this one.  I typically use Tommy Hilfiger but when I tried this I was smitten and theres no turning back now!  Now this is the only perfume in which I have understood the meaning of &#x27;top&#x27;, &#x27;middle&#x27;, and &#x27;bottom&#x27; notes.  The scent changes as you wear it.  I can smell the floral first, then the ivy, then the musk... I&#x27;m keeping this stuff around forever.. It&#x27;s definitely &#x27;LOLITA&#x27;...Innocent and sweet...  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pricewise:  VERY worth it!!!  (and I&#x27;m a bargain hunter) *grr*   A little goes a long way.. Yep, I&#x27;m smitten. *lol*</li>
    <li> More please, Lolita. Its really amazing, when I wear Lolita &lt;br /&gt;parfum I am in heaven:)</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! I was dying to buy it, when finally someone got it for me as a gift. It&#x27;s a great fragrance, it doesn&#x27;t wear off quickly and it&#x27;s smell is DIVINE. I get compliments on it just about every time I wear it...</li>
