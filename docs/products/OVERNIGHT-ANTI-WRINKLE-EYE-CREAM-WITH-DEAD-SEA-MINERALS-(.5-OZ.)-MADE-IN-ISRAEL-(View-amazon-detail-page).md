      <li>Good product and a good price</li>

      <li>like the smoothness of the cream, very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>think this a perfect eye cream for people with sensitive skin and eyes.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this every night since I got it, I&#x27;m not sure how much it&#x27;s making a difference, but I do know it slides on nice, and</li>
      <li>It was a decent price, so maybe it will work for you.</li>
      <li>Being that I have only had it a week I can&#x27;t say more only I can see it working.</li>
      <li>It is better to buy something that takes a little bit of time that way you notice the difference.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin &amp; this</li>
      <li>I have looked and looked for a product to work on my sensitive eye area.</li>
      <li>many eye creams at high prices that did nothing but end up drying my skin and irritating my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t hurt or irritate anything, but it&#x27;s particularly moisture rich, which is what the eye area needs (at least mine does).</li>

    <li> I use it for day and night since my skin is so dry! I have looked and looked for a product to work on my sensitive eye area. This is the product for me!!! Great! Excellent delivery and for keeping  me up to date on shipping and arrival.  Plan to buy more, later.</li>
    <li> Very good for dry skin</li>
    <li> Really works well and helps smooth out wrinkles used faithfully.</li>
    <li> Good product and a good price and does what it is suppose to do.  I suppose you can pay more but this does the job.</li>
    <li> I love the Dead sea Minerals line the best products I&#x27;ve used by far. With the cost of retail this was a steal thanks to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product...great price, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I found this eye cream irritating to my eyes.  I am really unable to use it comfortably, so cannot comment on its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I have used several of the Dead Sea Products and they have helped in some small way.  It is not an instant fix type  of eye cream.  If you get the instant fix type creams -- they are only instant for the time you put it on.  It is better to buy something that takes a little bit of time that way you notice the difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a few days, and it&#x27;s okay, but not spectacular.  It won&#x27;t hurt or irritate anything, but it&#x27;s particularly moisture rich, which is what the eye area needs (at least mine does).</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the performance of Dead Sea Minerals overnight eye cream. I must admit the low price scared me a bit; I usually use a $150 eye cream but am currently on a budget (thanks, student loans) so I had to look for a cheaper alternative.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always believed in the motto: \\&quot;You get what you pay for,\\&quot; but, so far, so good. This stuff works great.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still young and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles but my eye area does get extremely dry and this cream has kept it nicely moisturized without a greasy shine or glisten. It absorbs immediately, is non-greasy/sticky, and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I still recommend this cream if you just need a little moisture around the eye area but I have been using  it for several months and it has done absolutely nothing for my dark under-eye circles; so if dark under-eyes and/or puffiness is an issue, I would not recommend this product. I will be switching back to a more intense product.</li>
    <li> Hydrating but I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in wrinkles and I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months.</li>
    <li> I found that this product stung my eye area. I have very sensitive skin &amp; this just isn&#x27;t the product for me. It was a decent price, so maybe it will work for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every night since I got it, I&#x27;m not sure how much it&#x27;s making a difference, but I do know it slides on nice, and the skin around my eyes do not feel like I need to put more on (like some I&#x27;ve used.) yet it&#x27;s very light, and not at all greasy. I&#x27;ll stick with this one until I feel it&#x27;s not making any difference, but until then I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> does what it promises- apply morning and night-overall my skin looks healthier, firmer, fresher-recommend!</li>
    <li> love it  works  will definitely order again</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t see any results</li>
    <li> I gave this overnight anti-wrinkle eye cream 5 stars because it feels good, and you do not need to use a lot. I have tried&lt;br /&gt;so many eye creams at high prices that did nothing but end up drying my skin and irritating my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smoothness of the cream, very easy to apply. It really does work at improving the area around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I think this a perfect eye cream for people with sensitive skin and eyes. The price is also very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this eye cream for a few weeks, and am very satisfied. This is my product from now on.</li>
    <li> Yes I like it.  Around the eyes we need so much care and I find this working and soaking in. To me means it is doing something. Being that I have only had it a week I can&#x27;t say more only I can see it working.</li>
    <li> This cream is excellent from the first time that I used It I could notice the results, I recommend it for any case of lines and bags under the eyes.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen any results</li>
    <li> Not very impressive.  No change</li>
    <li> Ok product. quickly shipped.</li>
    <li> Feels smooth and moisturizing. Use every day.</li>
