      <li>Other than that, good buy for the price.</li>
      <li>This set is mini but perfect, After a while I decided to get small size polish bottle instead the regular size, cause most of the time I only use the color a couple times and I kept them into my kit, till they getting old or semi dry; I think this is excellent set</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a good size to travel but not worth the money even if it were one dollar.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> package was too small. too cheap for a gift</li>
    <li> Cute colors, small amounts but I never it all before it dries out when it&#x27;s a bigger bottle so the sizes were perfect for me.  The packaging isn&#x27;t the greatest- the top to the clear lacquer must not have been on tightly and some of it leaked out, causing the polish bottles to stick to the packaging.  Other than that, good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> These are smaller bottles but the paint dries nicely and goes on well.  Others have had problems, but I did not.  Came quickly and so forth.  The colors are close to what is shown in the picture - for my order anyway.</li>
    <li> after some uses, the nail polish becomes very tacky. the polish also dries VERRRRRRRYY slowly. and it has a strong odor.  its very cute, I&#x27;ll admit, but this isnt a great set of polish.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife and she loved it and it was inexpensive and she uses these all the time. Good inexpensive just because buy.</li>
    <li> All these colors go on sheer so you can . Literally use this as shine coats over other colors. They are all tinted with whatever color you see but then go on clear with a tint. This is the only set I say you won t. We&#x27;d a long last top coat since you can&#x27;t see it.</li>
    <li> So disappointed, none of the colors are as advertised. Specially the red color is completely off, it was actually a very tacky neon pink! See the picture I attached. Never buying this brand or from this buyer again, false advertising!</li>
    <li> cute variety, but they come of the nails too fast over night they bubbled and peeled off my natural nail</li>
    <li> The white and clear coat was the only thing that is same as pictured. The other colors are horrible! The red, is actually neon watery pink and the other three, I couldn&#x27;t explain what they are. :/ Very unhappy.</li>
    <li> great product, Fast shipping.  Perfect size.  this is a great price  for what you get and it  really is a  good product I love  nail-polishes I can travel with</li>
    <li> This polish is cheap and chips the first day I applied it. I would not order again and do not like it at all. It was a waste of money. It is better to stick to OPI or other brands that are long lasting. I think it actually is weakening my nails, if not it is definitely not making them harder/stronger and with the cheap polish it looks very tacky. I am dissatisfied. The bottles are mini and it&#x27;s a good size to travel but not worth the money even if it were one dollar. I actually found better polish at the dollar store. Sorry but just not for me.</li>
    <li> Well I ordered on Saturday received this on Monday. I was so excited just embarrassed by the size, it was really small, and yes I read the size but... Gesh! You get what you pay for. The polish was really thick which made it difficult during drying (smudges is no joke) &amp;#62;still waiting on my dryer&amp;#60;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it&#x27;s hard to rate this product, because of my own expectations of the product. Letting go of all, and that&#x27;s why I choose to give this product 3 stars better for professionals or if you already have skills, and want demo colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy, and hope I was helpful.</li>
    <li> everything was awesome, fast delivery no hastle. I teach cosmetology and my students loved the product when they were learning nail art it is a great product</li>
    <li> They are very small bottles and are super thick polish, very hard to achieve a French look. Also disappointed that the white brush was not smaller to make the French top easier to put on. Other than that I love the other colors on my nails even without the French tip.</li>
    <li> Good price for a set of 5 nail polishes.</li>
    <li> The nail polish flakes/cracks very easily, but hey, it is a cheap product -- so I wasn&#x27;t expected a whole lot. These are extraordinarily small bottles of polish that could be cute for a child. This product I do not care for and will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> These are a nice little travel set. As far as quality the are fine.&lt;br /&gt;I have such a hard time with my nails I can&#x27;t seem to find&lt;br /&gt;a product that works well.</li>
    <li> It was broken and leaking everywhere by the time I got it, it looked cheap though anyway. Not very happy.</li>
    <li> the color are all too transparent to do french manicure that i saw and tried</li>
    <li> Great colors for all skin types. Split up the set and paired a polish with Stila Lip Glaze for individual girlie gift for all my friends at Christmas. Everyone loved the thought behind the gift.</li>
    <li> I love these polishes</li>
    <li> Packaged perfectly and securely, small bottles but that fine cause it is travel size after all...the red is brighter in reality but absolutely gorgeous...I can&#x27;t wait to apply these polished I am in love with these cute lil bottles already lol</li>
    <li> Saw the packaging and the colors, and I had to get these for my sister&#x27;s birthday this year! She loves this kit and so does her little daughter. It&#x27;s over-the-top girly-pink and just a cheerful little gift, too. Great shades of pink and &amp;#34;French manicure&amp;#34; look for DIY pretty nails, too.</li>
    <li> NOt whAt I expEct3d nOt bUyiNq tHiz agAiN nOt hAppY wIth dAa prodUct dOn&#x27;t wAste yOur mOnEyy on thIz *</li>
    <li> This set is mini but perfect, After a while I decided to get small size polish bottle instead the regular size, cause most of the time I only use the color a couple times and I kept them into my kit, till they getting old or semi dry; I think this is excellent set each bottle is +/- half of the regular size bottle but to me it&#x27;s enough and the price is fabulous!!!</li>
    <li> Definitely good for a quick French manicure befotea job interview or a outing with friends and don&#x27;t have time to sit at a salon</li>
    <li> Terrible product. The polishes shouldn&#x27;t even be considered polishes. I was honestly afraid to even try them. Some of the bottles, I just threw out as soon as I got them.</li>
    <li> These are mini nail polishes, and they are wonderful! The colors are beautiful! I love these very much. Highly recommend these. They are small, so they could be great for kids too!</li>
    <li> Product arrived about 4 days after I ordered them and that was awesome, the nail polish is pretty thick but oddly enough has actually a pleasant sent to it. Will be ordering more of these 6 packs of polish.</li>
    <li> very nice love these.</li>
    <li> I love little nail polish containers. These are smaller than the store bought version which makes them cute and I feel better about not &amp;#34;wasting&amp;#34; polish that I do not use.</li>
    <li> the colors are very pretty and they don&#x27;t chip off very easy I really like it thanks great product i&#x27;m going to buy again</li>
    <li> I hosted a Spa Birthday Party for my daughter and ordered these to set up the &amp;#34;Nail&amp;#34; station. She loved it and the polish was great!</li>
    <li> Take note these are extremely miniature bottles. The formula is goupy and dries very slow. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is something that my teens use often and love it.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> This are alright. I just wish they were a lot more bigger. They were too small...but besides that they do the job.</li>
    <li> Good value..nice sized bottles.</li>
    <li> I got them in earlier then expected so thats always great! I like them but color in picture is a little misleading !</li>
    <li> KleanColor Nail Lacquer in a petite, travel-friendly size package. This set includes everything you need for a cute french manicure. I like my purchase</li>
    <li> This polish does not stand on your fingers long. I guess what you pay for. THis would be good for children</li>
    <li> The colors were thick in the bottle needed to put nail polish remover to thin it out took for ever to dry but the colors was nice for the most part</li>
    <li> Great little nail color set if you like the french manicure colors.&lt;br /&gt;Wearing it now</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like how I received my items. The bottle were so tight that when my fiance went to open them they broke on her. Not happy about this at all.</li>
    <li> They basically all show up clear, and we&#x27;re way smart than I had expected</li>
    <li> Not strong and color is so poor.</li>
    <li> First off, the colors differ a little from the picture. Nothing that might wreck your day, but still, be ready for BRIGHTER than you imagined (can&#x27;t tell if they look &#x27;normal&#x27; on fingers, my story doesn&#x27;t go that far).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what happened, but if you read the reviews, similar things have happend to others;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles had leaked, a little. The White bottle was 2/3 empty when I got it, and all over the box (bot not really on the other bottles), I tried opening the peach one, and it took some serious upper body strenght to get it open.&lt;br /&gt;The clear coat, however...UGH!&lt;br /&gt;As I twisted it, the bottle broke, and my finger slid along the glass, slicing it open.&lt;br /&gt;2 stitches later, I&#x27;m NOT a happy camper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were the only review to mention broken or leaking bottles, that would be one thing, but clearly this isn&#x27;t such an isolated incident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice? If you get this set and ANY of the bottles give you resistance when you try to open them; DON&#x27;T DO IT. Just throw them away.</li>
    <li> It comes I the mail like water</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice polish, but not as good a deal as it seemed when I ordered.  These bottles are TINY - they only hold 1/3 as much as the normal-sized Kleancolor polish bottles do.  The title says \\&quot;Mini Collection\\&quot;, not \\&quot;Collection of Mini&#x27;s\\&quot;, so I didn&#x27;t realize the bottles were so small until I received them.  The ad also says \\&quot;travel friendly size\\&quot;, but it wasn&#x27;t evident to me that this meant tiny bottles, because (I thought) ALL polish bottles are \\&quot;travel friendly sized\\&quot;.  Normally, Kleancolor packages their polish in 1/2 oz. bottles, so this set should have held a total of 3 oz. of polish, but this entire set actually only holds a TOTAL of 1.01 oz. (And including shipping, it was priced for about the same amount of money as I would have paid in my local stores for the larger bottles.)  Too bad this ad wasn&#x27;t specific (and honest) about the sizes of the bottles!  So, nice polish, nice gift-giving package, but don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking you&#x27;re getting more than you really are.</li>
    <li> KLEANCOLOR French Bijou - French Manicure Nail Lacquer Mini Collection... the perfect mini for little ladies and Mom too ...:)</li>
    <li> the colors are okay for doing designer nails. not much of a selection. polish not stay on long, does chip.</li>
    <li> I liked the colors of this nail polish, and apprciated the low price because of the smaller bottles, but unfortunatly, the color didn&#x27;t last more than 2 - 3 days tops.</li>
    <li> The bottles are little small bottles. The clear had some black specks in the polish. The bright white was a little thick. Overall, its a nice little set for touch up and travel.</li>
    <li> wonder purchase,  colors are amazing! wish i knew about this line prior to spend a small fortune at the beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not my favourite, but it&#x27;ll do. Best to only do one or two layers, if you do more if becomes really sticky and weird. So this is meant for a sheer look on your nails. The white is great, the top coat is alright, and the other colors are nice for it&#x27;s sheerness.</li>
    <li> Gift it to my family! The colors are cute, however, it wasn&#x27;t the pallet I was looking for. But it went for great usage time with my niece!</li>
    <li> NOT GOOD AT ALL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY DISSAPOINT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEVER TELL OTHERS TO BUY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEY LOOK GOOD , BUT NOT WHEN YOU PUT IT IN THE NAILS, IT  IS BAD QUALITY</li>
    <li> produto chegou em perfeitas condiçoes bem embalado, ainda nao tive oportunidade de usar , mas me parece bem bom  e preço tambem esta otimo</li>
    <li> Seller themselves are great and fast.  The colors aren&#x27;t as pretty as they look in the bottle.</li>
    <li> Its all in the title. The quality of this product was pretty low and it seemed to damage my nails.</li>
    <li> I imagined to receive regular sized bottles (maybe because you could buy 12 of the regular sized bottles for around 15 bucks on ebay) and the seller didn&#x27;t make it blatantly clear that these are miniature bottles. I thought &amp;#34;mini collection&amp;#34; just meant it was a small set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, the polish is awful besides that. The colors are all wrong...the dark red is actually a fairly light, sheer, pink (even thought it&#x27;s labeled sheer red) and the other colors are similar but a tad different also. 3 of the polishes were very thick and stripey when applied...the clear, pink and peach were okay but I didn&#x27;t like the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend really liked it, she said it was good quality. The bottles are the small ones but they seemed to have lasted a decent amound of time.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom for valentines day. I never got to see her use it because she went out to las vegas the night i gave it to her. but when she came back, it looked like she came right out of a profesional nail salon! I recommend this product to any girl out there who doesn&#x27;t want to spend the money to go drive out to the salon and pay for one. Why go to a nail salon when you have one right here in a box!</li>
    <li> I sent this to a friend along with a mini manicure set, for a friend who just started growing her nails again, and I saw the results of the French manicure she did for herself in a video, and they looked brilliant, even though the nails were still short, her nails looked wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this color selection is really convenient as a mini sampler kit, and was a cute gift with the other tiny manicure tool set.</li>
    <li> product quality is very bad. It is very brittle. do not last not even one day.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my sister, she said she tried 2 methods, on one hand she put the french tips on &amp;#34;first&amp;#34; before any of the primer or coats of anything, and those tips were so easy to work with because they actually stuck on in place. The other hand she put the tips on in the order it said to, which was after the base coat, the base coat was too slippery no matter what she did, and the tips are not very secure under the top coat, so so will from now on place the tips first .&lt;br /&gt;Attached is a pic of the first time she used the stuff</li>
    <li> it smelled like a bottle or 2 had busted.  But I could not see any leaks.  Once all the bubble wrap was removed and the plastic wrap, the odor was gone.</li>
    <li> The bottles are small but that&#x27;s not really too much of a problem when it&#x27;s for manicure and you only need a coat for each nail. Would not recommend the similar colors kits that are for a solid nail color, but the manicure one is cute, especially to experiment with different manicure tints.</li>
    <li> It is what I expected, small samples and not a full bottle.  Great for quick touch ups in between nail appointments</li>
    <li> The three pastel shades go on clear, even after 2 coats.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;sheer red&amp;#34; is shee hot PINK but I love it! It goes on amazing **That&#x27;s why I gave it 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;The white was really thick... nothing the &amp;#34;nail polish remover trick&amp;#34; couldn&#x27;t fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off 2 stars because I painted my fingernails with one of the pastel colors &amp; I was scratching my face &amp; it literally peeled off of my nail. Which made me realize I could just peel the paint off of every nail. Boo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish stayed on my toes nicely though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was reading some of the reviews &amp; I don&#x27;t know where the really bad ones come from... None of my bottles came in broken, none of them are only half full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more could I ask for for $5?! Come on now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp; Mini collection means smaller sized bottles, OBVIOUSLY. Don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to get full sized paint!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ll continue to use the polish on my toes but not on my fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;I usually go to the shop for my fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just have a phobia of getting my toes done in salons.</li>
    <li> One of the bottles was broken</li>
    <li> i am enjoying this due to the colors they are nice colors for me to wear n so simple love it</li>
    <li> I wanted something for a french manicure with variety.  This was exactly what I wanted. This gives me several looks to choose from when I give myself a french manicure.  The bottles are small, but I don&#x27;t mind that because nail polish usually has a considerable shelf life.  I would recommend this purchase to another person.</li>
    <li> This nailpolish is awesome , but my only problem is that it is tacky.</li>
    <li> The white and the two top coats are great I love those!! But the three pinks are very light and watery! So I was very disappointed in that!!</li>
    <li> Came in perfect time, none of the bottles were hard to open or came broken, I believe it was also bubble wrapped very well/, I like the colors I tried them out on my fiance&#x27;s feet minus the solid colors :P haha, they&#x27;re all very smooth and just great consistency aside from the white .! The white was horrible</li>
    <li> These are the best french colors I have yet tried. My nail bed looks very natural and the french very elegant.</li>
    <li> Though I did not like this nail polish, I emailed and got a very quick email back! Great service, even if the product is only okay</li>
    <li> Ordered this for 3 of the bottles. The white, the clear red, and the transparent peach. The red doesnt leave any color. It looks no different than clear coat. The peach was half empty when i got it.&lt;br /&gt;U get what u pay for.</li>
    <li> Thanks for good service and quick shipment . My daughter is spending more time on her nails instead of phone. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is a very cute french manicure set and my daughter loves them. The only problem I have with them, is that the polish is a little thick so it doesn&#x27;t leave a nice smooth coat, it gets clumpy very quickly. Other than having to add a little polish remover to the bottles to thin them out a little, this product is great for the price.</li>
    <li> Very small size .. and the color is very very light .. and it hurt you hand every time you tried to open it</li>
    <li> These are a very small set, think Bon Bons (remember those) maybe a little bigger, I bought them for my five year old so they were perfect and nice light colors that stayed on for longer than a day or two.</li>
    <li> This is a nice set for a reasonable price.  This item is being used as a filler in a Mom&#x27;s Day Out basket.</li>
    <li> Ooooh! This product have your nails looking so beautiful, this great for a french manicure, you use it once you will fall in love with it. I DID!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just what I thought it would be and more great or my 3 yer old niece she loves it</li>
    <li> I received tis item very fast and I like it or luv it a lot. I use it when I go out. Thx u &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Not only do the colors not match the picture portrayed (Ranging from too dark of a pink to a yellowish white instead of &amp;#34;sheer pastel nude&amp;#34;, or, that peachy looking color to my personal favorite &amp;#34;Sheer red&amp;#34; which looks more like &amp;#34;Strippers panties neon pink,&amp;#34;) but two of the 6 mini bottles were already unsealed and oozing out into the box.</li>
    <li> The only thing that bothered me was tat i did not Receive a sheer red, i got a hot pink color instead. Other than that, shipping was on time. It was packaged well. I like it.</li>
    <li> The white is very thick.  It was not dried in 25 minutes.  Other colors chipped.  The small polish bottles were difficult to open.</li>
    <li> Some colors are almost invisible and some are great. I like this set. But it chips the next day even with the fast drying top coat. Probably the quality is not the best. But I would buy it again since I do French mani only once in a while.</li>
    <li> The colors looked nice for the summer, but the product is very inferior to the Opi I usually use.  Good for a starter for teens.</li>
