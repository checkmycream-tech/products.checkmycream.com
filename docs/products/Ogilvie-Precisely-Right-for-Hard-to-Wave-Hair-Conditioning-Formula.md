      <li>I been using Ogilvie products for years and love them.</li>
      <li>The chemicals were not as &amp;#34;smelly&amp;#34; as some others that I have had in professional settings, which was very nice since this was done at home.  </li>
      <li>ogilvie perm was easy to use, instructions are easy to follow.</li>
      <li>works well but perhaps not as strong as in the olden days.  </li>
      <li>Works well on fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Happy with simple and easy usage.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>Have used this perm for years, and still is the only one that performs greatly on my hair ....</li>
      <li>I love you very much.</li>
      <li>When we were finished she had a lovely head full of pretty ringlets, just as we wanted.  </li>
      <li>My hair  extremely hard to curl this perm is just perfect plenty of curl, soft and manageable very pleased with this perm</li>
      <li>I have gray hair and thought this would be the perfect perm since I always had hard to curl hair.  </li>
      <li>I can use this product and follow the simple instructions and get as good if not</li>
      <li>hair is totally white and the texture is really in good shape and I attribute it to the Ogilvie ingredients</li>
      <li>Quick ordering/shipping process w/immediate delivery.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve permed my hair 2 months ago, and its still just as fresh as when it was first done!  </li>
      <li>I have very fine, stick-straight hair, and no other perm works for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased so many Olgivie perms that were old and the solution didn&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
      <li>had to find another place to get one right away</li>
      <li>This was NOT the right perm for me.  </li>
      <li>It always comes out just right.</li>
      <li>Its right on according to what the package says.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my first time to perform a perm on someone, but the directions were very clear and easy to follow.  </li>
      <li>wonderful but expensive</li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this perm since Ogilvie first introduced it --</li>
      <li>Precisely RIght to the results of friends who DID go to salons (and who spent WAY more money), I&#x27;d recommend this perm every time.</li>
      <li>As always--good curl, good body, very little &amp;#34;fuzzy ends&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand where these positive reviews come from????</li>
      <li>We followed them exactly, processing for maximum times as her hair wasn&#x27;t taking the curl very well.  </li>
      <li>Be sure and wait the recommended time before shampooing again or you might loose the curl.</li>
      <li>i have baby fine hair and it has been the only product that I have used because it does the job I want.  </li>
      <li>I will be purchasing this formula again if she wants her hair done again when it&#x27;s time.  </li>
      <li>it is gentle on hair.</li>
      <li>Burned my head so much I could not leave it on for the required time.</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s face it--why pay someone 5 times as much when you can do it yourself.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
      <li>I bought a box of three with amazon last year and the first one was good but the other two simply didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I usually do my own perms myself, and I have been using this brand for at least 20 years.  </li>
      <li>If your hair tends to be dry, take some time to do some heavy conditioning treatments so that your hair is in good shape before you perm.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>, I have think natural curly hair to my butt and wanted to save time after showering</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this as an affordable solution to perms, as our local shops were quoting me $70+ to perm her hair.</li>
      <li>Exactly what was expected.</li>
      <li>Though these solutions aren&#x27;t as caustic as most, it can be helpful to put a little petroleum jelly right around your hair line to protect your skin while perming.</li>
      <li>My hair is thin and fine as well as completely gray, so I do have to get another one about every two or three months.  </li>
      <li>A Really good product...doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and no odor remains if you rinse well after waving lotion AND neutralizer.</li>

<li> But I will say it did last a long time.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve always had a hard time getting my straight hair to roll up well.</li>
<li> Lasts quite a long time.</li>
<li> Came broken perm licked out first time</li>
<li> am 71 years of age, and gives me the long lasting curl I need for it last at least 5 mo....</li>
<li> Hold really tightly, even short hair at the nape of the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Came quicker then expected, and I had my mom do my hair</li>
<li> This allowed me to not only branch out brand-wise, but specify the \\&quot;hard to wave\\&quot; need.  </li>
<li> Living in a small mountain area, perms are limited to 1 brand.  </li>
<li> Leave on a little longer?</li>
<li> The box is broken, and the perm totally has no effect.</li>
<li> It seems like my mom never had as much trouble.</li>
<li> it means i wasted my money.</li>
<li> I do usually trim my hair as soon as the perm is finished and have no problem with split ends that way.  </li>
<li> So I would recommend it to anyone who has hard to wave hair--just not gray hair.</li>
<li> It says it&#x27;s for hard to perm hair</li>
<li> I give my sister perms and she has course thick hard to wave hair</li>
<li> However, the shipping was really slow.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m guessing outdated .</li>
<li> It dried my hair out terribly.  </li>
<li> Awful product!</li>

    <li> JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR</li>
    <li> Perm works great every time.</li>
    <li> I AM SO HAPPY TO RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT, THANK YOU SO MUCH!!</li>
    <li> Very good perm , make hair so soft, looks so good, I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great results !!!!! Delivers results!!!</li>
    <li> Burned my head so much I could not leave it on for the required time. I still got curls from it, but I would not use again.</li>
    <li> Worked wonderfully on my 11 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  It&#x27;s my first time to perform a perm on someone, but the directions were very clear and easy to follow.  We followed them exactly, processing for maximum times as her hair wasn&#x27;t taking the curl very well.  The chemicals were not as &amp;#34;smelly&amp;#34; as some others that I have had in professional settings, which was very nice since this was done at home.

I highly recommend this as an affordable solution to perms, as our local shops were quoting me $70+ to perm her hair.</li>
    <li> Living in a small mountain area, perms are limited to 1 brand.  This allowed me to not only branch out brand-wise, but specify the \\&quot;hard to wave\\&quot; need.  This perm arrived quickly and the results were awesome!  I&#x27;ve permed my hair 2 months ago, and its still just as fresh as when it was first done!  Great product with great delivery time.</li>
    <li> Awful product! I don&#x27;t understand where these positive reviews come from???? My hair looks and feels like straw!!! Now I have to shave it!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  i have baby fine hair and it has been the only product that I have used because it does the job I want.  Hair dressers have problems with my hair and I get a good perm when I use this product at home.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of waves put in but they didn&#x27;t seem to take but this time it did. Thanks Amazon. I love you very much. If I can&#x27;t find something local I&#x27;ll  probably check you out next.</li>
    <li> It just made my hair really wavy, not curly, but it looks very good. I used all sizes of rollers.</li>
    <li> I have used this perm for years and have had no problems.  I can use this product and follow the simple instructions and get as good if not better results than I get at a beauty salon.  I  wait the full waiting time recommended and have good results.  I do usually trim my hair as soon as the perm is finished and have no problem with split ends that way.  My hair is thin and fine as well as completely gray, so I do have to get another one about every two or three months.  Be sure and wait the recommended time before shampooing again or you might loose the curl.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased so many Olgivie perms that were old and the solution didn&#x27;t work as well.  This one worked great.  I&#x27;ll be reordering.</li>
    <li> My hair  extremely hard to curl this perm is just perfect plenty of curl, soft and manageable very pleased with this perm</li>
    <li> did not curl as I had wanted it to</li>
    <li> works well but perhaps not as strong as in the olden days.  Leave on a little longer?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always permed my own hair for years.  Let&#x27;s face it--why pay someone 5 times as much when you can do it yourself.  I have gray hair and thought this would be the perfect perm since I always had hard to curl hair.  This was NOT the right perm for me.  It dried my hair out terribly.  But I will say it did last a long time.  So I would recommend it to anyone who has hard to wave hair--just not gray hair.</li>
    <li> i never did receive the timing instruction sheet after multiple promises which were never fulfilled i gave up.  it means i wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Came broken perm licked out first time I had this happen had to find another place to get one right away</li>
    <li> Ogilvie is a great product for anyone doing their perm at home.  My perm turned out great.  I been using Ogilvie products for years and love them.</li>
    <li> Have used this perm for years, and still is the only one that performs greatly on my hair ....&lt;br /&gt;I am 71 years of age, and gives me the long lasting curl I need for it last at least 5 mo.... hair is totally white and the texture is really in good shape and I attribute it to the Ogilvie ingredients</li>
    <li> I have used alot of different perms and this one rates a 5 star to me. Its right on according to what the package says.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perm since Ogilvie first introduced it -- well, back then, my mom was doing my perms. I have very fine, stick-straight hair, and no other perm works for me. It never damages my hair, either.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for years, I have a couple tips:&lt;br /&gt;1. If your hair tends to be dry, take some time to do some heavy conditioning treatments so that your hair is in good shape before you perm.&lt;br /&gt;2. Though these solutions aren&#x27;t as caustic as most, it can be helpful to put a little petroleum jelly right around your hair line to protect your skin while perming. You can take the extra step of sticking cotton balls to the jelly, too. You WILL drip during the waiting time, and this will help your skin.&lt;br /&gt;3. I&#x27;ve always had a hard time getting my straight hair to roll up well. It seems like my mom never had as much trouble. I found out that it wasn&#x27;t me, it&#x27;s the rollers! I found some old Tony Home Perm rods at an estate sale and they are wonderful! Hold really tightly, even short hair at the nape of the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a perm done in a salon, but comparing my results with the Ogilvie Precisely RIght to the results of friends who DID go to salons (and who spent WAY more money), I&#x27;d recommend this perm every time.</li>
    <li> Love this brand ...has a warm activator solution which is a lot more comfortable when applying and results have been perfect</li>
    <li> Exactly what was expected. Exactly as advertised. Quick ordering/shipping process w/immediate delivery.</li>
    <li> I bought a box of three with amazon last year and the first one was good but the other two simply didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m guessing outdated . So the last two times I&#x27;ve ordered Ogilvie perm, I ordered just one at a time and they were both excellent perms. The perms are great if you order just one at a time. However, the shipping was really slow. They do not come prime. If you have lots of time to wait for the perms then this is the one to order. It took about 10 days the last time to get here. I give my sister perms and she has course thick hard to wave hair and they work great.</li>
    <li> The box is broken, and the perm totally has no effect. My hair is not curly at all.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product!! Excellent Seller!! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> As always--good curl, good body, very little &amp;#34;fuzzy ends&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Good perm and the price is right!</li>
    <li> Happy with simple and easy usage.&lt;br /&gt;Good product and it is gentle on hair.</li>
    <li> This perm has been probably the best I tried so far. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I usually do my own perms myself, and I have been using this brand for at least 20 years.  It always comes out just right.</li>
    <li> There is a reason Ogilvie has been around for decades...it works. It is easier to use than it is to pronounce. Just follow the enclosed directions and you will be guaranteed excellent results. Ogilvie has my approval.</li>
    <li> It says it&#x27;s for hard to perm hair</li>
    <li> ogilvie perm was easy to use, instructions are easy to follow. I loved the results and it was delivered when they said it would be.I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone wanting a home perm</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know haft to ask my girlfriend.</li>
    <li> Works well on fine hair.  Lasts quite a long time.</li>
    <li> wonderful but expensive</li>
    <li> Came quicker then expected, and I had my mom do my hair and it came out great, I have think natural curly hair to my butt and wanted to save time after showering so I did a perm to save time.</li>
    <li> A Really good product...doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and no odor remains if you rinse well after waving lotion AND neutralizer.</li>
