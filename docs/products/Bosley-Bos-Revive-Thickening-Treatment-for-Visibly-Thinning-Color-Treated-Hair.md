      <li>You don&#x27;t have to use very much of it to be effective.</li>
      <li>and  it&#x27;s so easy to use, not like the &amp;#34;other stuff&amp;#34; everybody uses!</li>

      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I ordered the Bosley Thickening Treatment for non-color treated hair.  </li>
      <li>is more of a product to hide your thinning hair problem if you are going out for the night.</li>
      <li>In between shampooing &amp; conditioning with appropriate Bosley products I use this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Bosley products for 8 or more years.  </li>
      <li>Not any better than something you can purchase at the drug store.</li>
      <li>I am on my second bottle and found Amazon to have the best price!</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, It is great to use while you are trying out other products because it does make your hair look good while it&#x27;s in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>For regular days, though, like at work, this product is ideal.</li>
      <li>I received the product very quickly after placing the order.</li>
      <li>My hair feels thicker, at the end of the day it is easily combed out where it used to be in knots</li>
      <li>This product does fine.  </li>
      <li>Works wonderful, hair looks thick and full!!</li>
      <li>My extra fine hair feels thicker and looks great.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement in the amount of hair loss I was experiencing.</li>
      <li>This product works great especially when combined with the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>My Dermatologist recommends Biotin which is available at Costco.  </li>
      <li>(It was original recommended by a trusted stylist who&#x27;d recommended the Bosley line to others.)</li>
      <li>Love Love Love this product, have purchased twice, last time I ordered 2 of them.</li>
      <li>Not to excited yet.  </li>
      <li>She was right!</li>
      <li>I have now bought all three of the full size versions.</li>
      <li>It really seems to make my hair thicker and fuller with more \\&quot;bounce\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>My hair is fine, but it&#x27;s always nice to thicken hair if possible.  </li>
      <li>SUPER PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>Found out it does matter, as I started losing more hair than normal when washing, again.  </li>
      <li>I noticed that I was losing more hair than normal when I washed it.  </li>
      <li>I can see new hair and better texture.</li>
      <li>The sample kit is worth a try.</li>
      <li>Price is good compared to other places.</li>
      <li>It is hardly fallling out compared to before use, amazing what this does to your scalp, refreshing almost minty and makes any itchiness go away.  </li>
      <li>It works about the best I&#x27;ve found so far for my very baby fine, thin hair.  </li>
      <li>After the first use, the hair loss had stopped.  </li>
      <li>I like it very much, but, hair is still falling out, though,  probably not as much.  </li>
      <li>I just started taking it, so my hopes are high!</li>
      <li>I found this product to leave my hair very greasy feeling</li>
      <li>and I have been using this for 6 months and haven&#x27;t noticed much.</li>
      <li>I DIDNT REALIZE HOW MUCH IT WAS HELPING UNTIL I RAN OUT OF IT.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>But hairspray makes my hair feel a bit gummy, if I use too much.</li>
      <li>This really helps thicken the hair.  </li>
      <li>Too much of a hassle to return the product.  </li>
      <li>and it really does make your hair appear fuller.&lt;br</li>
      <li>AS FAST AS I USE TO.  </li>
      <li>I am really liking this product.</li>
      <li>Has alot of lather and you don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
      <li>ALL THE TIME AND MY HAIR LOOKS MUCH THICKER&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t see any change for the time I used it.</li>
      <li>SO I SWITCH OUT EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS BETWEEN THIS AND THE YELLOW NORMAL TO FINE PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers comment on this product being over-priced for &amp;#34;just a mousse.&amp;#34; I couldn&#x27;t disagree more.</li>
      <li>I have been delighted with these products after purchasing a starter kit a few months back.  </li>
      <li>ALWAYS HAD VERY FINE HAIR BUT STARTING TO THIN ON TOP.</li>
      <li>This foam seems to give my hair a little more body as well.</li>
      <li>Gives a little more substance to my hair.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t  see as much improvement as promised, and I bought this for my 17 year old son :0</li>
      <li>I&#x27;M NOT SEEING NEAR AS MUCH HAIR IN MY SHOWER DRAIN SCREEN EITHER.  </li>
      <li>I am noticing some new hair growth.</li>
      <li>I CAN&#x27;T SAY THAT THIS PRODUCT HAS GROWN ME ANY NEW HAIR</li>
      <li>A NEW ONE AT NO CHARGE.  </li>
      <li>My hair grows faster using this product but does not grow any new hair in the loss of hair area.</li>
      <li>I am still not certain if this Bosley system actually is working, or if its my hair drying and giving a bit more volume.  </li>
      <li>I have lots of hair, but it&#x27;s super fine, so it looks thin.</li>
      <li>I have been using Bosley Bos Revive Thickening Treatment for Visibly Thinning Color Treated Hair for several years and it really does work.  </li>
      <li>A FEW MORE IN THE FUTURE.  </li>
      <li>I have tried numerous other products and Bosley is the only one that really does what it says it will do for fine hair.</li>
      <li>My husband&#x27;s dark graying dark looks better, not sure if it is any thicker but appears in better condition.</li>
      <li>I actually saw the new growth after 2 weeks of using this treatment.  </li>
      <li>you are back to your old self again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this product instead of any styling products and I have fuller looking hair.  It does not leave any sticky residue in my hair which I like.  I recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I like it.  It does add thickness.  I would like more but it helps.  I have to wash my hair by the third day.  I plan to buy it again</li>
    <li> I found this product to leave my hair very greasy feeling</li>
    <li> Great product.  Have been using for a year now.  Great price also</li>
    <li> Works well on thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I am really liking this product. It really seems to make my hair thicker and fuller with more \\&quot;bounce\\&quot;.  will buy again</li>
    <li> This product helps in keeping my hair from falling out.  It may not work for everyone but it works for me, love it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great price</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that my hair is growing, but my hair does look fuller, I use this product religiously but I am no hairdresser, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s actually growing any hair or if it just gives me volume.</li>
    <li> I am still not certain if this Bosley system actually is working, or if its my hair drying and giving a bit more volume.  I have continued to see a bald spot on the back of my head that this has not rectified, but I also do not use it twice a day as recommended.</li>
    <li> I have used the Bosley hair products for a while now! The Revive thickening works great! My hair has grown back! My stylist even said she can tell the difference when she does my hair!! Love it</li>
    <li> For starters, I haven&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair .  I purchased a second container hoping that it took a little longer to see a difference - didn&#x27;t happen.  Also. the container is a &amp;#34;foamer&amp;#34; and the product just comes out as a liquid.  I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product and definitely would NOT purchase it again.  Also would not recommend the shampoo and conditioner.  Not any better than something you can purchase at the drug store.</li>
    <li> immediate results excellent product</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with the Revive Shampoo and Conditioner and I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement in the amount of hair loss I was experiencing. This foam seems to give my hair a little more body as well.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is very nice. Has alot of lather and you don&#x27;t have to use much. A little conditioner does the trick. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s helping yet with thickening, but I like the product.</li>
    <li> My hair is supper-thin and dry. In between shampooing &amp; conditioning with appropriate Bosley products I use this. Gives a little more substance to my hair.  Makes it shine. I like it.</li>
    <li> Not to excited yet.  I know it takes time, but I am beginning to see some improvement, less hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have been delighted with these products after purchasing a starter kit a few months back.  I have now bought all three of the full size versions.</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair and I have been using this for 6 months and haven&#x27;t noticed much. Maybe it will work for you.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s dark graying dark looks better, not sure if it is any thicker but appears in better condition. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I DIDNT REALIZE HOW MUCH IT WAS HELPING UNTIL I RAN OUT OF IT.  ALWAYS HAD VERY FINE HAIR BUT STARTING TO THIN ON TOP. GIVES ME A FULLER LOOK WITHOUT WEIGHING HAIR DOWN. LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY HAIR TENDS TO GET USE TO ONE PRODUCT AND QUITS WORKING. SO I SWITCH OUT EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS BETWEEN THIS AND THE YELLOW NORMAL TO FINE PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, I used this every day - and the shampoo and conditioner every other day - for last 5 months and have see no change in my hair loss.</li>
    <li> I CAN&#x27;T SAY THAT THIS PRODUCT HAS GROWN ME ANY NEW HAIR BUT I CAN SAY THAT AT LEAST I DON&#x27;T SEEM TO LOSING MY HAIR AS FAST AS I USE TO.  I&#x27;M NOT SEEING NEAR AS MUCH HAIR IN MY SHOWER DRAIN SCREEN EITHER.  BY THE WAY, WHEN I RECEIVED MY SHIPMENT ONE OF THE TWO BOTTLES WAS DAMAGED AND THEY GRACIOUSLY SENT ME A NEW ONE AT NO CHARGE.  THAT&#x27;S GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE IF I MAY SAY SO !!!</li>
    <li> Helps my hair have body and shine.  I have tried numerous other products and Bosley is the only one that really does what it says it will do for fine hair.</li>
    <li> It thickens my hair without making it sticky.  I use it with the shampoo, conditioner, and mousse for best results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers comment on this product being over-priced for &amp;#34;just a mousse.&amp;#34; I couldn&#x27;t disagree more. I&#x27;ve used this product for several years now. (It was original recommended by a trusted stylist who&#x27;d recommended the Bosley line to others.) I knew I liked it for a reason but hadn&#x27;t had a break in use, so I&#x27;d effectively forgotten why. I ran out just before this replacement arrived, and I remembered why! I have lots of hair, but it&#x27;s super fine, so it looks thin. I&#x27;ve used plenty of products to try and add body or thicken it. I use hairspray when I want really big hair, like when I&#x27;m going out. But hairspray makes my hair feel a bit gummy, if I use too much. It feels dirty quicker, so I have to wash my hair more often. For regular days, though, like at work, this product is ideal. It gives my hair volume without feeling gummy or over-filled with product. And I can let my hair go a day or two without washing (yay for my color!) without it feeling (and smelling) dirty. One bottle lasts me a good couple months, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I ordered this as it leads you to believe that it will thicken hair. I have been using a few weeks now and my hair does not feel or look any thicker.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while now, and will continue doing so. I am very happy with the product. I can see the difference, and so can my family</li>
    <li> I have been using Bosley Bos Revive Thickening Treatment for Visibly Thinning Color Treated Hair for several years and it really does work.  I use it together with Bosley&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> This made a noticeable difference in the thickness in appearance of my hair</li>
    <li> After chemo I used a similar product which after a while stopped my hair from falling out but I was looking for more; fullness. I tried this brand and my hair started falling out again. I have since tried another brand and immediately my hair stopped falling.</li>
    <li> I use this on my clients wit thinning hair and it is remarkable on how it helps the hair feel and look thicker!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.</li>
    <li> This product does fine.  For the price, I don&#x27;t see any difference from any other and cheaper products that I have used in the past to thicken my fine hair.  I doubt if I will use again unless the price drops dramatically.</li>
    <li> this product was recommended by my stylist. She was right! I can see new hair and better texture. Love Bosley</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this product, have purchased twice, last time I ordered 2 of them. My hair feels thicker, at the end of the day it is easily combed out where it used to be in knots (I have super thin &amp;#34;Baby&amp;#34; hair). It is hardly fallling out compared to before use, amazing what this does to your scalp, refreshing almost minty and makes any itchiness go away.  Would seriously recommend this product. It is FABULOUS !</li>
    <li> I have been using the Bosley system for my hair and actually have noticed a difference in the texture of my hair (so has my hairdresser).  I would recommend this product.  This product doesn&#x27;t leave my hair weighted down or greasy looking.  The pricing from Amazon was great and very reasonable when purchased with Bosley shampoo and conditioner.  I received the product very quickly after placing the order.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser told me about this!  Works great and  it&#x27;s so easy to use, not like the &amp;#34;other stuff&amp;#34; everybody uses!</li>
    <li> This really helps thicken the hair.  I am noticing some new hair growth.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t see any change for the time I used it. My hair was hard to style after putting it on.  After trying it for a week I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore. If it wasn&#x27;t so sticky maybe I would have been able to test it better.</li>
    <li> SUPER PRODUCT. GIVES HAIR THE BOOST WHEN IT IS THIN.&lt;br /&gt;I USE IT ALL THE TIME AND MY HAIR LOOKS MUCH THICKER&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
    <li> I thought I would give a different product a try and this was not for me.  It made my hair feel stringy and even more thin than it was when I started using it. I used this product for over 4 months and didn&#x27;t see any difference. If not it was worse.  I ended up going back to Nioxin and noticed a difference within a week.</li>
    <li> This product works great especially when combined with the shampoo and conditioner. I use it every day for thicker looking, healthier hair.</li>
    <li> I PLAN ON ORDERING A FEW MORE IN THE FUTURE.  LIKE,  LIKE  LIKE! ! ! ! ! ! !&lt;br /&gt;BOSLEY IS GREAT.  ALL MY FRIENDS KNOW ABOUT THIS ALSO.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It goes on like a mousse and it really does make your hair appear fuller.&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that it does not actually FIX the thinning hair problem. This is not a &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; this is a cover-up product.&lt;br /&gt;This is more of a product to hide your thinning hair problem if you are going out for the night. It will not repair your hair or make your&lt;br /&gt;hair grow.&lt;br /&gt;However, It is great to use while you are trying out other products because it does make your hair look good while it&#x27;s in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;But once you wash it out...you are back to your old self again.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be making my hair fuller with less \\&quot;daylight\\&quot; problems. For good results, use treatment nightly and wash with  their shampoo and conditioner in the a.m. I saw results after about six months.</li>
    <li> Great results!!!! You just need to do it as it is explained on the bottle. I have been using it for almost a year now and I started to see good results after 3 months.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for about 5 months, and it is simply wonderful! If I will be blow drying and using a Flat Iron, I will add a bit of Thermal protection gel. Works wonderful, hair looks thick and full!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bosley products for 8 or more years.  I&#x27;m sure I ordered the Bosley Thickening Treatment for non-color treated hair.  I was sent Bosley Thickening for color-treated hair.  Too much of a hassle to return the product.  If it ever happens again, I will never order from you again!</li>
    <li> Great product!  I have been using this for a couple of years.  Results take awhile to see but they are there!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, after using this product for over a year and not seeing any results, I can&#x27;t recommend it.  A waste of money.  My Dermatologist recommends Biotin which is available at Costco.  A tablet that melts under your tongue.  It takes a couple of months to work.  I just started taking it, so my hopes are high!</li>
    <li> I noticed that I was losing more hair than normal when I washed it.  I started using Bosley for color-treated hair at my stylist&#x27;s suggestion.  After the first use, the hair loss had stopped.  Also, I have seen a lot of baby-fine growth, which my stylist said would get stronger.  And a lot of it has.  I used Bosley which was not for color-treated hair a couple of times, as the wrong product had been given to me and I thought it wouldn&#x27;t matter.  Found out it does matter, as I started losing more hair than normal when washing, again.  So, if you have color-treated hair, be sure to use the product  that is specifically for it as it does make a difference.</li>
    <li> Price is good compared to other places. Didn&#x27;t  see as much improvement as promised, and I bought this for my 17 year old son :0(</li>
    <li> My hair grows faster using this product but does not grow any new hair in the loss of hair area.</li>
    <li> After one month I noticed a difference in my hair. You don&#x27;t have to use very much of it to be effective.</li>
    <li> ...these Bosley products. I used to have a lot of hair fall-out from heridary reasons and stress...but not anymore! Try it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using the shampoo, conditioner and the thickening treatment. My extra fine hair feels thicker and looks great.</li>
    <li> I like it very much, but, hair is still falling out, though,  probably not as much.  This treatment  alone make my hair feel thicker.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again.  ( I have only used it about 4 times).  Thanks</li>
    <li> Started with the sample kit and like the products well enough to order all three items in the kit.  It works about the best I&#x27;ve found so far for my very baby fine, thin hair.  The sample kit is worth a try.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me.  I actually saw the new growth after 2 weeks of using this treatment.  I started using the product twice a day as recommended.  After a month, I&#x27;m only applying once a day.  I have recommended this product to other friends. My hair is fine, but it&#x27;s always nice to thicken hair if possible.  I part my hair and my scalp has always shown.  I will continue to use it so I can thicken my hair.  I am on my second bottle and found Amazon to have the best price!</li>
