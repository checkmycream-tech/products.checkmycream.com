      <li>It&#x27;s a great choice for daytime wear, although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for special occasions as it doesn&#x27;t have that sexy edge that makes fragrances appropriate for nights out.</li>

      <li>glad I order this.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for carrying it</li>
      <li>i love it and so does my mom, if you want to bi</li>
      <li>* some more go to</li>
      <li>and i really love it</li>
      <li>She absolutely loved it, and I have to say that it smells pretty gosh</li>
      <li>SCENT WAS VERY SWEET SMELLING</li>
      <li>Shipped safely and was packaged securely.  </li>
      <li>Isn&#x27;t strong or overpowering.</li>
      <li>so I really cannot rate the product itself, however, arrived well packaged and in time to give to a good friend&#x27;s daughter for her Sweet 16.</li>
      <li>My sister is a huge fan of Couture Couture, so I decided for Christmas</li>
      <li>It was the real deal, smells amazing.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes you buy perfume to find it is a cheap version.  </li>
      <li>Now, I can enjoy it as often as I please.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is light and full of floral notes with some citrus thrown in.</li>
      <li>thanks girls for coming up with an amazing perfume to mimic the juicy line, even though i feel this smells a whole lot better.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this the first time I tried it in a store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>also pleased that Juicy Couture offers this an Eau de Parfum since it has more staying power than than Eau de Toilette.</li>
      <li>Young people love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I have always loved Juicy Couture, and this product was no different.</li>
      <li>My roomate has always used it and whenever she puts it on I always loved the smell and finally decided that it was time to get myself one.</li>
      <li>While I couldn&#x27;t pick out the mandarin notes, the berry element to this fragrance was very evident.</li>
      <li>this is my new favorite fragrance.</li>
      <li>Box the perfume came in was damaged &amp; looked very old!!!!</li>
      <li>Smells just like juicy and in fact, listen here, all you haters can be quiet because i feel this might even be better than juicy!</li>
      <li>Would definetly recommend to anyone interesting in smelling sexy and pretty but not loud.</li>
      <li>Smell is worth the price.</li>
      <li>I love Juicy couture, The only thing I had a problem with is the size of the bottle</li>
      <li>Make sure it is sprayed on clothes though so it last.</li>
      <li>do still love the perfume, but it may last a bit longer if you spray it on your clothes rather than just your wrists/neck.</li>
      <li>the scent is not too strong, fruity, sharp, sweet, and overall lovely smelling.</li>
      <li>I bought a very small sample without being able to smell the perfume, and am glad I took a chance.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m not usually girly, but this perfume is fun</li>
      <li>Really sucky.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not musky at all, which I really like.</li>
      <li>but i had it seems like forever because you dont have  to use much</li>
      <li>I have purchased this perfume before from a department store and it had a much stronger scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many questions with this one as the fragrance is unlike any other I&#x27;ve smelled before.</li>
      <li>It is strong enough to last the day and that make it worth the price.</li>
      <li>I noticed the floral notes, in particular the honeysuckle, but as it settled on my skin, the fruity notes took over.</li>
      <li>For my Mom, she loves it, she bought more, it is a casual, fresh youthful scent, for me not too sweet.</li>
      <li>This scent can be worn day or night, and most fragrance purists would say this is a summer scent, I wear it year round.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I initially thought because of the fruity notes that this fragrance would be most appropriate for summertime, I also have found myself wearing it quite frequently in the colder months, for the simple fact that it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fresh and modern, without being too heavy on the floral.</li>
      <li>but, it is the same except for the high price.</li>

<li> , it was to small, it wont last me much longer</li>
<li> Also, the bottle was wet on the outside when I received it.</li>
<li> Will buy it again hands down again in a bigger size &amp; tell friends</li>
<li> Small, not to expensive I guess, and fit in the stocking, plus the wife likes it and its for her...</li>
<li> OTHER SCENTS HAVE IT BEAT.  </li>
<li> I find that I can go without reapplying for about 4-5 hours whereas with EDT formulations typically give me 3 hours at the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> As for the amber and sandalwood, I didn&#x27;t notice them at all, but I did pick up on the slight candy finish of vanilla and caramel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> it&#x27;s not too heavy, lasts long without being overbearing, and people around me usually compliment me on it...</li>
<li> It lasted me less then probably 10 days.</li>
<li> /&gt;However, I bought it and the store stuff must be a little bit stronger because it stays longer.&lt;br</li>
<li> I was doubtful at this low price this could be real</li>
<li> So Left me a lil&#x27; questionable about the product.</li>
<li> One of the very few fragrances that works with my body chemistry.</li>
<li> This was way to expensive for something that was so small.</li>
<li> you could probably pull off this scent in both a casual or fancy situation.</li>
<li> I was disappointed in the size for the amount paid, will shop else</li>

    <li> Nice smelling perfume. Purchased as a gift.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this perfume before from a department store and it had a much stronger scent. While it does smell like the actual perfume, it does seem to have been diluted quite a bit. Also, the bottle was wet on the outside when I received it. I&#x27;ll stick to buying perfume at the department store.</li>
    <li> Small, not to expensive I guess, and fit in the stocking, plus the wife likes it and its for her...so I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> Shipped safely and was packaged securely.  My fiance loved the gift and it smells wonderful.  Five more words are required.</li>

    <li> Love this scent. Cheaper on Amazon than in any store! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> PERFUME IS JUST OK...OTHER SCENTS HAVE IT BEAT.  SCENT WAS VERY SWEET SMELLING</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this! I bought a very small sample without being able to smell the perfume, and am glad I took a chance. This fragrance is light and full of floral notes with some citrus thrown in. It&#x27;s not musky at all, which I really like.

    <li> Wonderful scent, ok price.</li>

    <li> It is what it is. Amazing! Smell is worth the price. It is strong enough to last the day and that make it worth the price. Make sure it is sprayed on clothes though so it last.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Juicy Couture, and this product was no different. Would definetly recommend to anyone interesting in smelling sexy and pretty but not loud.</li>
    <li> I was doubtful at this low price this could be real but, it is the same except for the high price. I love it. The sent is just the same, same bottle. NO knock off. I&#x27;ve wanted Juicy for a while, glad I order this. Now, I can enjoy it as often as I please. Thank you for the low price!!!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this the first time I tried it in a store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I bought it and the store stuff must be a little bit stronger because it stays longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do still love the perfume, but it may last a bit longer if you spray it on your clothes rather than just your wrists/neck.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and although it arrived in a timely manner and boxed safely I was disappointed in the size for the amount paid, will shop else where next time...</li>
    <li> this is my new favorite fragrance. it&#x27;s not too heavy, lasts long without being overbearing, and people around me usually compliment me on it...I&#x27;ll be ordering some more veerryy soon &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> Box the perfume came in was damaged &amp; looked very old!!!! (Used) So Left me a lil&#x27; questionable about the product.</li>
    <li> This was way to expensive for something that was so small. It lasted me less then probably 10 days. Really sucky.</li>
    <li> Great product.. Arrived in timely manner</li>
    <li> My sister is a huge fan of Couture Couture, so I decided for Christmas I&#x27;d get her the viva la juicy to change it up a bit. She LOVES it more than couture couture!</li>
    <li> For my Mom, she loves it, she bought more, it is a casual, fresh youthful scent, for me not too sweet.</li>
    <li> this is a good it smells great the bottle last longer than i would think because of the size but i had it seems like forever because you dont have  to use much</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mom. She was very pleased! My dad had wanted her to wear this scent after he smelled it on a lady at his work. The gift made them both very happy :)</li>
    <li> When I initially sprayed on Viva La Juicy I noticed the floral notes, in particular the honeysuckle, but as it settled on my skin, the fruity notes took over. While I couldn&#x27;t pick out the mandarin notes, the berry element to this fragrance was very evident. As for the amber and sandalwood, I didn&#x27;t notice them at all, but I did pick up on the slight candy finish of vanilla and caramel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I initially thought because of the fruity notes that this fragrance would be most appropriate for summertime, I also have found myself wearing it quite frequently in the colder months, for the simple fact that it&#x27;s not overwhelming. I have found that some of the fragrances I used to wear that were heavier on the patchouli and sandalwood don&#x27;t work as well for me anymore since they give me headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also pleased that Juicy Couture offers this an Eau de Parfum since it has more staying power than than Eau de Toilette. I find that I can go without reapplying for about 4-5 hours whereas with EDT formulations typically give me 3 hours at the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really am happy that my husband selected this one. It&#x27;s fresh and modern, without being too heavy on the floral. It&#x27;s a great choice for daytime wear, although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for special occasions as it doesn&#x27;t have that sexy edge that makes fragrances appropriate for nights out.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a christmas gift, and i guess it gets alot of rave reviews! Young people love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Great travel size of my favorite perfume. I ordered a bigger perfume before, so then I have one for home and one for travel.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!! My roomate has always used it and whenever she puts it on I always loved the smell and finally decided that it was time to get myself one. I do not wear perfume a lot so I got the .5 oz size and it is perfect for me. I just wear it when I go out to eat or to a party or on days I feel like I want to smell good. Love it and will be definitley buying more!! Shipping was super fast and came in excellent condition!!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!!!! Everytime I wear it I get compliments! Isn&#x27;t strong or overpowering. Thank goodness. I recommend it 100%.</li>
