      <li>I have been using them for decades and they seem to no longer be available in stores-</li>
      <li>so I went to my brand name and found them available online.  </li>
      <li>but my hair wont fit in the.</li>
      <li>and it stays comfortably.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure it is a good manufacturer, but I really wish they still made them in the larger 4 inch size to hold my longer hair!</li>
      <li>This is perfect, I have thick curly hair and it was a breeze putting this on</li>
      <li>Easy to use, pretty in color.  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>I am so glad there are suppliers of these classic barrettes.  </li>
      <li>I started using these barrettes in high school and thought I&#x27;d never be able to find them again.</li>
      <li>Works good with long hair.  </li>
      <li>These clips are good, as long as you stick with the metallic-colored ones.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I was searching for, a true 3&amp;#34</li>
      <li>It works good for doing this with half my  hair up though</li>
      <li>Highly recommend them and also recommend that you buy more than one package as I worry that because I had to find these on Amazon and not in my local stores, these barrettes may be no longer available.  </li>
      <li>These work great for thick hair</li>
      <li>but I can pull enough hair from the top and</li>
      <li>They are perfect for holding my thick bangs back without a bulky clip or pins.</li>
      <li>and I have very little hair but quality it good.</li>
      <li>fairly large barrette cant find in stores hold well</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s real metal not faux plastic looking like metal.</li>
      <li>but they work very well.  </li>
      <li>They hold in place, even through a night&#x27;s sleep, are perfectly comfortable, and will not get tangled even in my long hair.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping these were actually the larger size which I used to be able to buy at stores but haven&#x27;t seen for some time.</li>
      <li>I have bought a pack of these every year since high school</li>
      <li>Holds a good amount of very thick hair without bending/breaking...</li>
      <li>like those new barrettes can hold think hair as well as the metal doomed ones.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this since my childhood and have trouble finding this exact size at the super markets or Target.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re smaller than expected and the color on the barrettes wears off very quickly.</li>
      <li>They are not long enough to fit all my hair pulled back, but that&#x27;s not the fault of the barrette.</li>
      <li>They are smaller than I really wanted.</li>
      <li>Really, I like wearing my hair back in the summer and it seems like every barrette I put in my hair ending up popping off</li>
      <li>Surely they&#x27;ll last me till I&#x27;m dead.</li>
      <li>Not what I was expecting, but since my hair is thick, these are the only clips that are easily applied and hold consistently, so I&#x27;ll stick with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
      <li>These aren&#x27;t meant for overly thick hair (I can only pull the top section of my hair back for a very hippy 60&#x27;s look)</li>
      <li>It is the main anchor for my long hair-dos, when I wear it up.</li>
      <li>Like them but not as large as expected!!</li>
      <li>The other types break easily (cheap plastic) or are too small.</li>
      <li>they seem curved too much but after bending it a little straighter they work well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find hair clips that don&#x27;t look silly in the workplace, but these are great.</li>
      <li>These are great for half up, half down styles for my thick hair.</li>

<li> Thin, cheap metal and small compared to what Goody use to make for large barrettes.</li>
<li> I have thick hair and was hoping it would work to secure my pony tail upside down for the waterfall pony tail effect</li>
<li> I have long hair to my waist, it is wiry and these were the only type of barrettes which worked well with my hair.</li>
<li> I have thin, fine, long hair that I like to pull back partially and create the 60s bump.</li>
<li> I was surprised really, that these thin clips could hold my longer than shoulder length hair up without needing several bobby pins or other clips.</li>
<li> Highly recommend them for people with thick hair.</li>
<li> Smaller barrettes will not hold my hair, but extremely large sizes are too big for putting my hair half way up and my thin hair slips out.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only had mine for 2 days and already the dark colored barrette is flaking apart.</li>
<li> I use the dark one regularly, and after a while, the dark color rubs or chips off.  </li>
<li> This is the only barrette that will hold my thick, heavy hair;  I&#x27;ve tried several different products.</li>
<li> they are big enough to hold my hair (which is thin) in a french twist.</li>
<li> Not much to say about these barrettes except I like them.</li>
<li> As someone with very long haiir, I sometimes have the need to twist my hair up, even for sleeping, but finding something to hold all that hair securely is not so easy.  </li>
<li> And these were less $ than the discount department store.</li>
<li> I have long, thick curly hair and this one piece barrett</li>
<li> or it was too tight.  </li>
<li> These are a little shorter than the ones</li>
<li> Too narrow, it won&#x27;t hold a pony tail</li>
<li> but I have been unable to find these in a single color for a long time.</li>
<li> It is hard to find a barrette for heavy hair.</li>
<li> ; barrette that is hard to find.</li>
<li> and they&#x27;re like gold to me now since they&#x27;re hard to find.</li>
<li> I have really thick hair and have had a hard time finding barrettes that I like.  </li>
<li> If you have thick hair there not for you.  </li>
<li> sides to keep my very thick hair from falling in my face.</li>
<li> Its disappointing because of the color flaking off</li>

    <li> fairly large barrette cant find in stores hold well</li>
    <li> I started using these barrettes in high school and thought I&#x27;d never be able to find them again. They are perfect for holding my thick bangs back without a bulky clip or pins.</li>
    <li> Holds a good amount of very thick hair without bending/breaking...it&#x27;s real metal not faux plastic looking like metal.</li>
    <li> I have used this product since I was in my teens.  I have long, thick curly hair and this one piece barrett holds it all together perfect.  Easy to use, pretty in color.  Will purchase this item over and over as needed.</li>
    <li> A great classy clip that will never go out of style. It&#x27;s hard to find hair clips that don&#x27;t look silly in the workplace, but these are great.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was searching for, a true 3&amp;#34; barrette that is hard to find.</li>
    <li> These work great for thick hair</li>
    <li> Great barrettes!  Great htf size! Recommended!</li>
    <li> Too narrow, it won&#x27;t hold a pony tail and I have very little hair but quality it good.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re smaller than expected and the color on the barrettes wears off very quickly. I&#x27;ve only had mine for 2 days and already the dark colored barrette is flaking apart. These aren&#x27;t meant for overly thick hair (I can only pull the top section of my hair back for a very hippy 60&#x27;s look) but I guess they&#x27;ll do for now. Its disappointing because of the color flaking off but oh well.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product to keep hair back and out of the way. Nice sturdy metal barrette.&lt;br /&gt;Lost mine and I am so glad  to have found yours.</li>
    <li> I have been using this line of barrettes for over 20 years. They can handle thicker hair and still close. This model is not designed to hold huge quantities of hair but I can pull enough hair from the top and sides to keep my very thick hair from falling in my face. The finish does chip off the darker colors though so I wish the packet was just the silver model but I have been unable to find these in a single color for a long time.</li>
    <li> I am glad I thought to look for these here on Amazon.  I only use the silver one so it seems a bit wasteful to have to buy 3 - but I am glad to get this barrette for my hair.</li>
    <li> Quality is very good. Arrived quickly. They are smaller than I really wanted.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re a good size, good colors for my brown hair, and keep my hair out of my eyes.</li>
    <li> I was hoping these were actually the larger size which I used to be able to buy at stores but haven&#x27;t seen for some time. These are nice and as advertised and I&#x27;m sure it is a good manufacturer, but I really wish they still made them in the larger 4 inch size to hold my longer hair!</li>
    <li> I was surprised really, that these thin clips could hold my longer than shoulder length hair up without needing several bobby pins or other clips. And these were less $ than the discount department store. Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair and have had a hard time finding barrettes that I like.  Love these!  Highly recommend them for people with thick hair.</li>
    <li> Like them but not as large as expected!!</li>
    <li> They are not long enough to fit all my hair pulled back, but that&#x27;s not the fault of the barrette.</li>
    <li> I had thought this was discontinued.  It is the main anchor for my long hair-dos, when I wear it up.</li>
    <li> they seem curved too much but after bending it a little straighter they work well. they are big enough to hold my hair (which is thin) in a french twist.</li>
    <li> This is the only barrette that will hold my thick, heavy hair;  I&#x27;ve tried several different products. I wish they came with 2 of a color, rather than 1 of 3 colors, but I buy 2 pkgs, so I&#x27;m set.</li>
    <li> These are much smaller than they use to be.  If you have thick hair there not for you.  I bought them, I&#x27;m stuck with them, but would never buy again</li>
    <li> As someone with very long haiir, I sometimes have the need to twist my hair up, even for sleeping, but finding something to hold all that hair securely is not so easy.  These work well.  They hold in place, even through a night&#x27;s sleep, are perfectly comfortable, and will not get tangled even in my long hair.  Practical and well priced. Who could ask for more?</li>
    <li> Over-priced for what you get, but guess that is why shipping is \\&quot;free\\&quot;. Thin, cheap metal and small compared to what Goody use to make for large barrettes.</li>
    <li> Had to buy these for a middle school play. They held my daughters hair up in braid under the wig she had to wear. Costume woman swears by them.</li>
    <li> I was so thrilled when these arrived - they are exactly what I was looking for! I have bought a pack of these every year since high school and I was devastated when I could no longer find them anywhere! These are great for half up, half down styles for my thick hair. These stay put with no fancy tricks and look simple and chic. I&#x27;ll buy these again from Amazon next year!</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine, long hair that I like to pull back partially and create the 60s bump. Smaller barrettes will not hold my hair, but extremely large sizes are too big for putting my hair half way up and my thin hair slips out. This is the perfect size for me and holds everything in place. I have been using this since my childhood and have trouble finding this exact size at the super markets or Target. Thank God for Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have searched and searched for this type of barrettes for the longest time and finally found them. They used to be a staple at any store be it Wal-Mart, Target, beauty stores outlets and suddenly they disappeared. I have long hair to my waist, it is wiry and these were the only type of barrettes which worked well with my hair. The other types break easily (cheap plastic) or are too small. I am so happy something so simple is available once again. I just ordered two packages and can&#x27;t wait to receive them. Whoever decided to have them out on the market, I cannot say thank you enough.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about these barrettes except I like them. I&#x27;ve used them for many, many years and they&#x27;re like gold to me now since they&#x27;re hard to find. Glad I found them on Amazon. Surely they&#x27;ll last me till I&#x27;m dead.</li>
    <li> These clips are good, as long as you stick with the metallic-colored ones.  I use the dark one regularly, and after a while, the dark color rubs or chips off.  Not what I was expecting, but since my hair is thick, these are the only clips that are easily applied and hold consistently, so I&#x27;ll stick with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After months of use, I&#x27;ve found that even the metallic colored barrettes lose their coating by chipping away with wear.  It starts on the underside of the clip, where the thumb rubs when applying to hair.</li>
    <li> these are great for work</li>
    <li> I can no longer find barrettes this size in any of the stores here in southern&lt;br /&gt;Florida so I went to my brand name and found them available online.  Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and was hoping it would work to secure my pony tail upside down for the waterfall pony tail effect but my hair wont fit in the. It works good for doing this with half my  hair up though</li>
    <li> OMG-  I am so glad there are suppliers of these classic barrettes.  I have been using them for decades and they seem to no longer be available in stores- like those new barrettes can hold think hair as well as the metal doomed ones.  These are a little shorter than the ones I used- which were 3 and 1/4 in but they work very well.  Highly recommend them and also recommend that you buy more than one package as I worry that because I had to find these on Amazon and not in my local stores, these barrettes may be no longer available.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for this item for a while and was so glad to find it.  Met all expectations.</li>
    <li> Works good with long hair.  It is hard to find a barrette for heavy hair.</li>
    <li> I love these hair clips!</li>
    <li> So glad I got these! Really, I like wearing my hair back in the summer and it seems like every barrette I put in my hair ending up popping off or it was too tight.  This is perfect, I have thick curly hair and it was a breeze putting this on and it stays comfortably.</li>
