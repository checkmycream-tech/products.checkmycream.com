      <li>It grips hair easily and doesn&#x27;t snag.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair with no body</li>
      <li>When using a fresh brush, it catches more easily than after you break it in with the hair products on it.  </li>
      <li>I made a HUGE mistake.  </li>
      <li>The salon where I first bought it had discontinued it, so I wrapped the handle with duct tape and continued to use it for more years.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to find this on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It works great when my hair is wet, though.</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite brush.</li>
      <li>Now I am able to have a brush in my luggage, ready to travel.</li>

      <li>My four year old daughter also lets me use this on her without any grimaces or Princess!drama, so that&#x27;s worth</li>
      <li>I would recommend this brush to any women who wants a brush that does not break your hair.  </li>
      <li>When I couldn&#x27;t find these, I was thinking of starting my own company to manufacture and sell something similar.  </li>
      <li>super fine straight to super thick curly) prefer this brush.  </li>
      <li>Very gentle on fine hair with minimal breakage</li>
      <li>Have used this brush for 25 years, new one every 4 to 5 years.  </li>
      <li>Until then, I am a bit embarrassed about my hair and my new \\&quot;hair cut.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is my favorite -- it&#x27;s the only brush that allows me to flip my hair under without putting down the hairdryer.</li>
      <li>I assume the technique for blow drying is to lightly catch each section of hair, without any need to pull it tightly around the brush.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m a bit sensitive to these things.  </li>
      <li>Your hair doesn&#x27;t tangle with these, and they are soft on your scalp.</li>
      <li>I like that the bristles are flexible - it feels soft against your scalp.  </li>
      <li>The first time I tried it I used it to blow dry the front of my all one length, below the shoulders, hair.  </li>
      <li>I have medium to fine hair, straight hair that has a little body that I like to blow dry out of it, and so it works well for me.  </li>
      <li>I have the small diameter one right now, but will be buying the large barreled one.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe they don&#x27;t sell this at the big box stores because it is really the ONLY brush that works.  </li>
      <li>There is NO other brush out there that even compares.  </li>
      <li>I can say that it&#x27;s never gotten any more tangled in my hair than any other type of round brush.  </li>
      <li>Other brushes either pull too hard and hurt or only get through the top layer.  </li>
      <li>Because the core of the brush is so thin, my hair easily gets tangled around it.</li>
      <li>It feels gentle on the scalp, if you want to massage your scalp a little.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I purchased this brush based on the wonderful reviews for the 2 1/2 inch version.  I made a HUGE mistake.  The first time I tried it I used it to blow dry the front of my all one length, below the shoulders, hair.  The result?  The brush got stuck in my hair.  My friend and I tried for over an hour to get it out and couldn&#x27;t.  The bristles had essentially locked my hair in and the brush wouldn&#x27;t budge.  So, sadly, my friend had to cut the brush out of my hair.  Yes, I said cut!!!  It&#x27;s been 10 days since it happened and I still can&#x27;t believe it.  I am now sporting a mullet and let&#x27;s just say I am not happy.  I am counting the days until my hair grows out.  Until then, I am a bit embarrassed about my hair and my new \\&quot;hair cut.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> It feels gentle on the scalp, if you want to massage your scalp a little. The ends are not really rounded; they&#x27;re tiny flat ends. Nonetheless, the bristles are so flexible that it feels very gentle, at least to me and my guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they had different sized barrels. All the barrels are small, and it&#x27;s the bristle length that varies. I assume the technique for blow drying is to lightly catch each section of hair, without any need to pull it tightly around the brush. That way it should not tangle. It penetrates so well that you will definitely catch your hair on it, even very short hair. The tag on it says it for short or medium length hair. I think it will be great for anyone who wants light, fluffy styles.</li>
    <li> Incredible volume and truly tangle free.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to blow dry my bangs and love the volume it gives them.&lt;br /&gt;Best price here on Amazon too, salon price is MUCH higher.</li>
    <li> We had a few brushes like this about 25 years ago.  They were loved dearly, worn out, then lost.  When I finally found these, I rejoiced and spread the news to my extended family who are all also addicted to these.  There is NO other brush out there that even compares.  I have very long thick slightly curly hair, and this is the ONLY brush that can get through it.  Other brushes either pull too hard and hurt or only get through the top layer.  All my girls with various hair types (super fine straight to super thick curly) prefer this brush.  I can&#x27;t believe they don&#x27;t sell this at the big box stores because it is really the ONLY brush that works.  The others are a waste of money, don&#x27;t work, or hurt.  When I couldn&#x27;t find these, I was thinking of starting my own company to manufacture and sell something similar.  Now I don&#x27;t have to!  I do think this brush could be improved with a smaller barb/no barb on the end.  Maybe Spornette could do that option in the future.  Anyway, the lady who got her hair stuck in this brush didn&#x27;t know what she was doing.  I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for 25 years and never had that problem.  Maybe if you twisted it in all different directions, but that would happen with any brush.  Thank you Amazon for carrying these brushes!  I&#x27;ve always used the largest and been very happy.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find this on Amazon.  I had bought one from my hairdresser a few years ago, and he had called it a \\&quot;spore\\&quot; brush, and I was always on the lookout for one, but since he had the name wrong, I&#x27;d been without.  I have the small diameter one right now, but will be buying the large barreled one.  I can say that it&#x27;s never gotten any more tangled in my hair than any other type of round brush.  I like that the bristles are flexible - it feels soft against your scalp.  My four year old daughter also lets me use this on her without any grimaces or Princess!drama, so that&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s weight in pixie dust.  I have medium to fine hair, straight hair that has a little body that I like to blow dry out of it, and so it works well for me.  Maybe the person whose hair got stuck has a different consistency that doesn&#x27;t work well with the brush?</li>
    <li> Love this brush!!! Great for long or short hair!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a good round brush for what seems like forever. After reading reviews, I went with this one. It failed me! Because the core of the brush is so thin, my hair easily gets tangled around it. I threw it away after a few uses.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this brush to any women who wants a brush that does not break your hair.  Great for giving hair some lift.</li>
    <li> makes my hair a bit frizzy but it is an OK brush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a hair brush, what can I say. It does seem to be made well. The bristles aren&#x27;t as long as I thought they would be but it works nicely.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I&#x27;ve used. Works great on wet or dry hair. Love.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these brushes for my unruly hair for years. They do not destroy the ends of my hair like other brushes do and last forever.</li>
    <li> Terrific brush... Hubby loves it!</li>
    <li> This is the best styling brush.  I have fine hair with no body so I need to style everyday to add volume.  This brush grips my hair without clunking my head.  I had brain tumor surgery so I&#x27;m a bit sensitive to these things.  I like the flexibility of the bristles, yet it still grips great.  I use this for styling, not detangling.  I use the brush that came with my blow dryer for that.  If you are rolling the brush and a knot stops the motion, just reverse the direction and it will release.  I bought extras of this brush so when it wears out, I&#x27;ll always have one.  When using a fresh brush, it catches more easily than after you break it in with the hair products on it.  I&#x27;ll never use another brush.</li>
    <li> I got one of these brushes from my hairdresser about 20 years ago and loved it. Over the years, the handle began to decompose and get sticky. The salon where I first bought it had discontinued it, so I wrapped the handle with duct tape and continued to use it for more years. Finally, after re-taping it 3 times, I found it here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite -- it&#x27;s the only brush that allows me to flip my hair under without putting down the hairdryer. I accidentally forgot to pack it one time when I went on vacation; nothing at CVS or Target worked and my hair didn&#x27;t look right for a week. Now I keep a spare in my suitcase so I won&#x27;t forget. If they ever stop making it, I&#x27;ll have to cut my hair short.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist charges $14 for one of these brushes.  It works on short or medium length hair.  Love the brush.</li>
    <li> This brush seems to make my hair have a bad case of static electricity. It works great when my hair is wet, though.</li>
    <li> Great product! Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Very nice brush.  Very gentle on fine hair with minimal breakage</li>
    <li> Have used this brush for 25 years, new one every 4 to 5 years.  Occasionally get talked into buying different style but always back to this brush.  No tangling or pulling and works well blow drying with any length hair.</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect for short to mid length hair.  It really grabs to make body or flips easy to accomplish.</li>
    <li> Love these.  I have several.  Your hair doesn&#x27;t tangle with these, and they are soft on your scalp.</li>
    <li> My hair feels so much thicker using this during a blow out! It also helps cut down the drying time by a lot. It grips hair easily and doesn&#x27;t snag. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years.  I was glad to find it on Amazon.  Now I am able to have a brush in my luggage, ready to travel.</li>
    <li> I have always purchased Spornette brushes if I have the option. This one is well made&lt;br /&gt;and the bristles and the size of this brush are great for using with a blow druer.</li>
    <li> Good brush, no static.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite brush.</li>
