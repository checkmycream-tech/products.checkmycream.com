      <li>They were delivered super fast too!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s not why this is a positive one!</li>

      <li>Products are exactly as described.  </li>

      <li>there was no leak, they twist up and down smoothly.  </li>
      <li>I was able to twist it all the way up and back down again.</li>
      <li>Caps fit tight.  </li>
      <li>My only issue is that no matter how much I fill or over-fill the tubes, I  still have the little hole in the middle and the perfectionist in me wants a smooth surface.</li>
      <li>This is not a super important factor for me personally, but maybe for others that are selling or wanting their tubes to last a longer</li>
      <li>I was really hoping it would work, as they are only made to work with &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; company&#x27;s tubes, but those are much more expensive and NOT BPA-free, so, I  gambled that the dimensions would work</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These containers are working really well for me and my home made lip balms. The screw threads seem good, and the tops snap on nice and tight. I might also use them for some solid perfumes. I would definitely purchase again! This honest review is posted in exchange for product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Place a second order for these and these next ones did NOT screw all the way down - the base stops a good half inch above the bottom! Disappointed this time around!!</li>
    <li> Great price for quantity - nice quality too.</li>
    <li> I love making natural lip balm to give as gifts to family and friends and these empty containers worked great. The plastic is better quality than most lip balm tubes you purchase at the store with the product already inside. Caps fit nice and snug without being too tight, and the clear see-thru design is very modern and showcases the end product in a professional way (especially if you are making colored lip balm). The bottom turn knob works both ways so you can raise or lower your product at whim without fear of it wearing out or breaking with use. I haven&#x27;t needed to reuse any of the tubes just yet, however as good quality as they are, I am certain they will hold up for multiple recipes. I especially love that these are BPA-free by a company that is family owned and operated here in the USA which is very important to me. Delivery to my home was super speedy as well. I will definitely be ordering these containers again when the time comes. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was given the product by the company in exchange for an honest review. I have to say that I am very pleased with these lip balm tubes. They are great quality ,temperature resistant and bpa free!!!! All made in the USA .  Thank you diynatural for an amazing affordable product.</li>
    <li> Like the fact that they are BPA free. Best price for good quality. Fast shipping, thanks</li>
    <li> We were ask to try these and give an honest review. And I can honestly say I love them. They work perfectly for making and selling our organic bees wax lip balm.

    <li> These are really great lip tube containers. I had a very easy time filling them and they did not leak at all. They are super affordable and the quality is great - just as expected. After reading reviews on other lip tubes I knew that these would were the best choice and they did not disappoint. I did receive these tubes from the manufacturer but would buy them again in a second!</li>

    <li> Perfect for making DIY lip balms.  I first considered the twist cap containers but this is much more sanitary.  Works great, Iove the clear caps. A bargain</li>
    <li> Great Lip Balm Holders!!!! package came super faster and safely protected. Thank You!!!! I can&#x27;t wait to try them out making lip balms.                Update They have everyone a refund for a product review but never gave me one.</li>
    <li> I bought this over a competitor&#x27;s because of the fact that these are BPA free AND made in the USA. I just would rather not purchase something from China if I can be offered the same stuff made in the homeland, even if I pay the couple extra bucks.&lt;br /&gt;However these are smaller than your typical lip balm tubes. They are skinnier... none of them really state how many ozs it holds so I didn&#x27;t know. This is not a super important factor for me personally, but maybe for others that are selling or wanting their tubes to last a longer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall you can tell that these are high quality lip tubes.</li>
    <li> This are great. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Very happy with these lip balm tubes. The tops fit snugly and a healthier choice than most. One receives a $1.00 coupon for writing a review. That&#x27;s not why this is a positive one! I do truly like this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product! Quality is great! The caps snap on great. I&#x27;m looking forward to using them soon! This is my honest feedback in return for promo.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with these tubes! I&#x27;ve been using them for about a week. I was able to twist it all the way up and back down again. (Some brands their twisty up thing doesn&#x27;t work well)  I am receiving this as a promo in exchange for a honest review but I would buy again at full price. There was no chemical scent and the caps stay on well too!</li>
    <li> Worked well for my homemade zit zapper.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Just as described. Worked well for my project!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my homemade lip balms.</li>
    <li> Color me way impressed.  First, packaged well. Second, not even an acrid hint of that awful plastic smell. And I was nose deep in the bag. It was clean. That&#x27;s pretty nice. They are BPA free. They FEEL nice, they have a nice almost satin feel to them. I dry ran the mechanisms and they ran smooth. Caps fit well.  I purchased a silicone holding tray from my soap supply company that holds all 50 tubes at once for filling.  I was really hoping it would work, as they are only made to work with &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; company&#x27;s tubes, but those are much more expensive and NOT BPA-free, so, I  gambled that the dimensions would work and they did. Bonus.&lt;br /&gt;I filled tubes with hot balm. No leaks. I haven&#x27;t had any complaints yet about them not turning or working. In my dry-run, they did work to the end and back down. I filled that tube and I am using it now.  The mechanics seem to be sound.  My only issue is that no matter how much I fill or over-fill the tubes, I  still have the little hole in the middle and the perfectionist in me wants a smooth surface. Its, overall, a trite complaint and I will return for more tubes from this company.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t counted them, nor the caps, but I&#x27;ve used quite a few and they&#x27;re perfect. They seem sturdy enough to wash and refill.</li>
    <li> Disclosure:  I received these for free.  Received on time as promised.  Products are exactly as described.  Used for home made organic lip balms....there was no leak, they twist up and down smoothly.  Products work as they promised.  Would definitely recommend.  Will reorder when I run out.</li>
    <li> Great quality and perfect size for my organic lip balms! They were delivered super fast too! This place is my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for lip balm containers!</li>
    <li> I have ordered lip balm containers from this company several times. I like the clear caps which have always fit nice and tight. I Love the fact they are American made too!</li>
    <li> These worked very well. All the caps fit nicely and I did not encounter any problems with leaks or inconsistencies. And, I like the confirmation that they are BPA free.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Perfect for making your own lip balm.  Caps fit tight.  Product works great!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE. I like that they are clear and BPA free. The lids fit well too.</li>
    <li> Wow! When I put this in my cart, the price was $12.99. Now, in less than a week, it&#x27;s up to $21.99!! Very disappointed. Seemed like a great product at a fair price but I&#x27;m going to have to keep looking....</li>
