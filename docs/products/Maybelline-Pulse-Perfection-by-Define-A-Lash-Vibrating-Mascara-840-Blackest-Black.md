      <li>too love this product.  </li>

      <li>When I first used this, I thought OMG this is absolutely the best I have ever used!!  </li>
      <li>and I have always loved this mascara since i first tried it, then it was discontinued in stores.</li>
      <li>It made my friends eye lashes look beautiful, and full; and she encouraged me to try; i have sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>Thank God, it is still available through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>So far, so good.  </li>
      <li>I decided to look here, and OMG... so excited to find it again.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
      <li>I was so excited about it</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have full lashes and it does enhance my lashes, making them look fuller.</li>
      <li>Other than that, this product is great.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara and have not been able to find it locally in any stores.  </li>
      <li>I received the mascara rather quickly after I ordered it.</li>
      <li>I am a cosmetology major right now, and I love this product.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;really helps evenly spread out your lashes and at&lt;br /&gt;the same time look long &amp; beautiful.  </li>
      <li>However it is pretty flaky</li>
      <li>The vibrating wand helps define the lashes and it looks really pretty.</li>
      <li>I wasnt happy with the Blackest Black as it seems to work different...</li>
      <li>It really does stay on all day and it won&#x27;t smudge.</li>
      <li>I really thickens your lashes.  </li>
      <li>AND REALLY MAKES YOUR LASHES LOOK</li>
      <li>I really like this mascara</li>
      <li>The vibrating does absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>I have always loved this mascara and was super sad when I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
      <li>the vibrating part didnt work which is basically the main point i buy this mascara</li>
      <li>THEIR LONGEST, DOESN&#x27;T SMUDGE, BUT WASHES OFF EASILY, i HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
      <li>My favorite mascara, but since being discontinued in stores, it seems like the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
      <li>whatevs.the reason is that maybe you put so many layers on without waiting it to dry and then clump is only normal thing</li>
      <li>This brush is no different than if I bought a cheaper mascara with a fine brush it would be the same thing!</li>
      <li>Everything is fine with this mascara; but the price is a little be high because the chipping cost.</li>
      <li>Truly waterproof, and super easy to get big, thick lashes in just 2 coats.</li>
      <li>I was surprised how my look changed.change your applying style</li>
      <li>this is the only mascara that I have found I really, really like.  </li>
      <li>and then try.you will be surprised that sometimes this is not product fault but your applying style</li>
      <li>It clumps!Though the liquid is a nice dark black, my lashes all stuck together!</li>
      <li>I have short and not very thick eyelashes, but this mascara made my eyelashes look full and the color was very black</li>
      <li>Just be careful to not put TOO much on or it will clump up.</li>
      <li>My only gripe is that the button is a bit harder to push and hold down, but worth the savings!</li>
      <li>My issue is with the packaging, when I took the wand out of the bottle the tip was bent, and no matter how much I tried to bend it back the other way, I couldn&#x27;t, and so I paid $10 for something I can&#x27;t use.</li>

    <li> So far, so good.  I had used anyone&#x27;s pulse mascara for years and then it was discontinued.  Decided to give this a try and I think it&#x27;s great.  AND it&#x27;s 1/3 the cost!  Time will tell if battery lasts.</li>
    <li> Good product. Item was as advertised.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and have not been able to find it locally in any stores.  I&#x27;ve tried other mascaras but none of them meet the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used. I&#x27;ve used Maybelling, Lancome, Almay, and Smashbox. It beats them all.</li>
    <li> Everything is fine with this mascara; but the price is a little be high because the chipping cost. They should sale it at the stores.</li>
    <li> Hey.i dont have this mascara yet but i plan to purchase it.i read that often about mascara they say it clump or whatevs.the reason is that maybe you put so many layers on without waiting it to dry and then clump is only normal thing what you will get.first times when i started use mascara i put many layers to define my eyes like models do but it always clump even if they say it is some kind of non clumping and well definind who separate all lashes.i blame all mascaras but later i tryed put one layer,wait a few seconds until its dry and then put next.I was surprised how my look changed.change your applying style and then try.you will be surprised that sometimes this is not product fault but your applying style fault.well i keep hopes up and cant wait when get this.My friends say its great and give me to try.i loved it.they purchased from here in good quality.because of my friends good rewievs i give 5 star.</li>
    <li> I received the mascara rather quickly after I ordered it. I was so excited about it and I immediately put it on. I have short and not very thick eyelashes, but this mascara made my eyelashes look full and the color was very black (like it was supposed to be). I am a cosmetology major right now, and I love this product. It really does stay on all day and it won&#x27;t smudge. It holds the curl in your lashes all day too. I would definitely recommend this. Just be careful to not put TOO much on or it will clump up. Other than that, this product is great.</li>
    <li> This made me look like I have false lashes but not in a bad way! Amazing I just ordered another...I am in love!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara!!! It lenghthens and thickens dramatically and it looks beautiful! The vibrating wand helps define the lashes and it looks really pretty. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Defines the lash and thickens.  I don&#x27;t have full lashes and it does enhance my lashes, making them look fuller.</li>
    <li> This discontinued mascara is  just great- no clumps, great coverage, no flaking and makes your lashes look nice! I have bought it through Amazon several times, and buy it several at a time. I keep the extras in the frig for freshness and to stop any possible bacteria from forming.</li>
    <li> So sad that this mascara  is discontinued. I try others similar from Maybelline and other brands and I ending wasting my money.&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes are short and thin and this mascara make them look thick ,long and is very easy to remove. I hope Maybelline bring it back to the market without the vibrating, that I never use.</li>
    <li> Was a little anxious to see this mascara because I wanted to see how it worked. After getting it I couldn&#x27;t master the whole vibrating and putting it on but then again I am a plain jane so maybe someone with more experience would do better then me!</li>
    <li> I wish they would bring this mascara back it was the best one ever</li>
    <li> I have purchased Pulse perfection Mascara before...I usually buy from Amazon. I normally have ordered Pulse Perfection in Very Black...and I have always loved this mascara since i first tried it, then it was discontinued in stores. I love that it keeps the curl after i use my eyelash curler...However the Blackest Black seems to be a different formula, as when i used it , it was thick and sticky(maybe old?) and I curled my eyelashes as usual,applied the Blackest Black mascara...and my eyelashes were straightened,and seemed sticky/clumpy! I wasnt happy with the Blackest Black as it seems to work different...I will have to re-purchase in &#x27;Very Black&#x27; ...dissapointing!</li>
    <li> My issue is with the packaging, when I took the wand out of the bottle the tip was bent, and no matter how much I tried to bend it back the other way, I couldn&#x27;t, and so I paid $10 for something I can&#x27;t use. I used to love this mascara!</li>
    <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
    <li> GOES ON GREAT AND REALLY MAKES YOUR LASHES LOOK THEIR LONGEST, DOESN&#x27;T SMUDGE, BUT WASHES OFF EASILY, i HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara, but since being discontinued in stores, it seems like the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long. It&#x27;s a shame because it&#x27;s such a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this mascara and was super sad when I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. I decided to look here, and OMG... so excited to find it again.&lt;br /&gt;Best mascara ever.</li>
    <li> So sorry they took this mascara off the market-but glad I can still order it.  The best mascara I have used.  Doesn&#x27;t clump or go on too heavy.</li>
    <li> Maybelline PULSE Perfection is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried hundreds of different brands of mascaras over the years.&lt;br /&gt;For me, nothing compares to this.  The vibrating brush&lt;br /&gt;really helps evenly spread out your lashes and at&lt;br /&gt;the same time look long &amp; beautiful.  I could no&lt;br /&gt;longer find this product in stores, so when I found it on&lt;br /&gt;this website I bought 20, for me and all my girlfriends&lt;br /&gt;who too love this product.  Please continue to sell this mascara!</li>
    <li> Works great lashes look longer and separated.</li>
    <li> When I first used this, I thought OMG this is absolutely the best I have ever used!!  I really thickens your lashes.  I don&#x27;t know why they discontinued the product, maybe because after the battery runs out, it is hard to replace?  The vibrating is the key.  For some reason, without it, it doesn&#x27;t have the same effect.  Thank God, it is still available through Amazon.  I buy several at time.</li>
    <li> it worked for like a week then vibrater is juss crazy wants to work when it wants it was alright/...;.</li>
    <li> The mascara is dry and flaky.</li>
    <li> It made my friends eye lashes look beautiful, and full; and she encouraged me to try; i have sensitive eyes and it made my eyes water, alot.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It seems to go on easier and no clumping.  The no clumping is definetly a plus.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s great.  this is the only mascara that I have found I really, really like.  Hope I can still get this product thru Amazon</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Truly waterproof, and super easy to get big, thick lashes in just 2 coats. Why did Maybelline stop making this? It will be a sad day for me when I can no longer get it :(</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed by this product. It clumps!Though the liquid is a nice dark black, my lashes all stuck together! The vibrating does absolutely nothing. This brush is no different than if I bought a cheaper mascara with a fine brush it would be the same thing! The wand is so long it really is difficult to get to your eye lashes. I was hoping this would be the mascara for my coming up wedding, I am definitely gonna have to keep looking.</li>
    <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used!!!!!</li>
    <li> the vibrating part didnt work which is basically the main point i buy this mascara so that was dissapointing.</li>
    <li> Got this to replace my very expensive Lancome oscillating mascara. It works even better! The formula doesn&#x27;t smudge all day! My only gripe is that the button is a bit harder to push and hold down, but worth the savings! Love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara and it looks great on. However it is pretty flaky so i have to seal it with a waterproof mascara so it doesnt flake on my face.</li>
