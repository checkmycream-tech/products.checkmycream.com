      <li>and you won&#x27;t be able to smell it once it&#x27;s on your eyes.</li>

      <li>That&#x27;s perfect for my dark lashes. .</li>
      <li>I guess it might work if you have light color eye lashes.</li>
      <li>not as vibrant as I would have liked</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s fun!</li>
      <li>If you like bright blue eye lashes</li>

      <li>No thanks, Golden Rose.</li>
      <li>Great buy and not easy to find!</li>
      <li>The color is barely noticable indoors, although my BF said he could see it better in natural light.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this mascara as it goes on easily, dries quickly, is NOT oily</li>
      <li>it arrived on time and was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>If you use a white primer before, the color will pop more</li>
      <li>Better than the royal blue in covergirl brand.</li>
      <li>This blue mascara does not come out as the color on the tube displays, it appears more purple</li>
      <li>Love this shade of blue</li>
      <li>but it actually smells more like sun block.</li>
      <li>I will continue my search for a better, BRIGHTER electruc blue mascara</li>
      <li>It more of a blue purple color</li>
      <li>The mascara actually comes on pretty much as blue as it appears in the tube without having to put very much on or be under bright lights.</li>
      <li>It looks like a very pretty and rich royal blue in the tube, but it does not come out like that at all.</li>
      <li>Meh, I&#x27;ve gotten better blue eyelashes from the cheap drug store blue mascara.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t show up on dark lashes at all, but still a nice formula.</li>
      <li>if you are going for something with major WOW factor, this is not it!!!!!!</li>
      <li>and I was very surprised to find it on Amazon and in exactly the color I was looking for!</li>
      <li>I expected a more intense pigment, and some lengthening my lashes ..</li>
      <li>All ready know five people intersted in buying product.</li>
      <li>Im use to using volumizing mascaras, so I didn&#x27;t like how it didn&#x27;t really do anything else(like</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t worry too much about the smell given that you have to hold the wand or the tube up to your nose to smell it</li>
      <li>Even then, I thought it separated my eyelashes very well</li>
      <li>the color doesn&#x27;t really come through</li>
      <li>I really like this mascara...</li>
      <li>I really like the color of this mascara.</li>
      <li>expected more from this mascara</li>
      <li>I put this over my regular black mascara for that beautiful blue &amp;#34;shadow&amp;#34; of color.</li>
      <li>so many are more of a powder blue or else so blue they are black.  </li>
      <li>The consistency of the mascara itself is decent and appears to hold the curl of the lashes well.</li>
      <li>I bought 2 different brands and both are VERY blue :)</li>
      <li>Decent mascara.</li>
      <li>I find most blacks too harsh, and don&#x27;t like the look of brown.  </li>
      <li>On the other hand, the seller was fantastic.</li>
      <li>GOOD BLUE IS HARD TO FIND.</li>
      <li>Love the color but the mascara is way too runny or just takes too long to dry.</li>
      <li>Pretty and BLUE!</li>
      <li>Such a pretty color</li>
      <li>My lower lids swelled up and the right side got a very puffy bump for several days even though I only wore the mascara for a couple of hours.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Will let you know when I get around to using yet which as of yet I have not done.Thankyou. Blue Mascara</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara... it&#x27;s really eletric blue and it looks great on pictures. The only thing that bugs me a little bit is the smell. kind of like acrilic painting!!!Nothing that you can&#x27;t get over though.  I would recomend to all my friends... it&#x27;s really Great!!!!</li>
    <li> Color hardly shows. Not dense or thick leaving skimpy lashes. I swear this is the worst mascara I&#x27;ve tried in my entire life. Maybe I just received an old one. On the other hand, the seller was fantastic.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have found this product. The royal blue mascara I have used for the past 30 years, started making my eyes itch. No problem at all with this one. I love it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t show up on dark lashes at all, but still a nice formula.</li>
    <li> It broke soon as I opened it and it was so thick &amp;clumpy.</li>
    <li> I truly like the color, and it goes on smoothly, I would have liked the brush to be a bit thicker/fuller, this prevents the lashes from clumping.  I have to use another thicker brush to keep the lashes from clumping.</li>
    <li> A striking cobalt blue, very pretty.  Decent mascara.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, but not that bright. I was looking for something a bit more opaque in it&#x27;s color, like a clear, bright cobalt on my lashes. This is more like a tint. The blue is only noticable on the lighter tips of my lashes, and the bottom, darker parts of my lashes are still black. I guess that&#x27;s OK if you&#x27;re going for a subtle look, but... I wanted some pop. The color is barely noticable indoors, although my BF said he could see it better in natural light. Meh, I&#x27;ve gotten better blue eyelashes from the cheap drug store blue mascara.</li>
    <li> I like blue mascara and this is the best I have used.</li>
    <li> I had every intention of returning this item but got so swamped with work that I forgot to send it back. It came broken, container was never sealed so all the fluid inside is oozing all over the place. So mad I didn&#x27;t get to send it back and get my money back. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was looking for! nNo one carries this color anywhere and I was very surprised to find it on Amazon and in exactly the color I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I expected a more intense pigment, and some lengthening my lashes .. I will continue testing,It is very light. expected more from this mascara</li>
    <li> I would LOVE to leave a review about the actual product, because I had been waiting a week and a half for this to arrive, but it arrived broken. Since it is an add-on item, I would have to make another $25 purchase to get another one. No thanks, Golden Rose. I guess I&#x27;ll have to get my mascara somewhere else.</li>
    <li> So hard to find the right blue... so many are more of a powder blue or else so blue they are black.  I put this over my regular black mascara for that beautiful blue &amp;#34;shadow&amp;#34; of color. When the light hits them they look great.</li>
    <li> Such a pretty color but caused my eyes to swell and burn. My lower lids swelled up and the right side got a very puffy bump for several days even though I only wore the mascara for a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> Very blue! I bought 2 different brands and both are VERY blue :) Applying it over a base of black makes it look nicer though.</li>
    <li> The key with this &amp; any mascara in my opinion is to remove the excess from the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it. I have gone through sooo many mascaras trying to find the perfect blue one &amp; I am so happy I finally did.</li>
    <li> Love the color but the mascara is way too runny or just takes too long to dry. Maybe bit of both. Im use to using volumizing mascaras, so I didn&#x27;t like how it didn&#x27;t really do anything else(like adding lenght/ volume)besides making my eyelashes blue. Also noticed that the color doesn&#x27;t show up as much in artificial light as it does in daylight.</li>
    <li> It looks like a very pretty and rich royal blue in the tube, but it does not come out like that at all. It took way too many swipes on my lashes for any color to appear at all. if you are going for something with major WOW factor, this is not it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this shade of blue, but as many had said it doesn&#x27;t show much on darker lashes. However, if you&#x27;re out in the sun u can actually see the blue!</li>
    <li> Better than the royal blue in covergirl brand. This goes on a little thicker  bc it doesnt come with that sissy brush covergirl has. If you use a white primer before, the color will pop more</li>
    <li> I am a pale skinned blond with thin, short eye lashes.  I LOVE this mascara as it goes on easily, dries quickly, is NOT oily so I don&#x27;t look like a raccoon by the end of the day.  Everyone comments on how nice it looks with my gray/blue eyes.  I find most blacks too harsh, and don&#x27;t like the look of brown.  This is my 2nd purchase of this product.</li>
    <li> Great mascara, doesn&#x27;t clump, seems to be good quality. It&#x27;s not too blue, so if you are looking for the blue to \\&quot;pop\\&quot; this may not work for ya. For me, I wanted to be able to wear it to the office as well so I didn&#x27;t want anything over the top.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try something different, since most girls want their eyelashes to be black. My eyelashes are already black and long so I never bothered putting mascara on until I tried on colored mascara. When you look at the wand the color looks really intense, but it goes on subtle unless you apply another layer. The color is an electric blue, like a violet blue, so if your looking for real blue, it&#x27;s not. I have dark brown eyes and it still looked flattering according to many people. One con is that the formula is sticky which can clump, but not a clump consistency like l leaving tiny balls or clumps, just sticky. Even then, I thought it separated my eyelashes very well, I recommend this to those that like bright colors on their eyes.</li>
    <li> I give it two stars for packaging and quick delivery bt the color is darker than i thot. It shows up in fluorescent light bt its disappointing especially for that price. I will continue my search for a better, BRIGHTER electruc blue mascara</li>
    <li> This item looks more \\&quot;electric blue\\&quot; than a dark blue. It is very pretty.Great quality mascara and attractive.I would recommend this product to all.</li>
    <li> Nice mascara.  Love it. Makes my lashes pop!</li>
    <li> the color doesn&#x27;t really come through</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara.</li>
    <li> Pretty-- pretty-- but not true blue. It more of a blue purple color but I like it. It lengthens your lashes nicely and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
    <li> This blue mascara does not come out as the color on the tube displays, it appears more purple and it&#x27;s very hard to see the color on the lashes.</li>
    <li> If you like bright blue eye lashes that&#x27;s what you are looking for! Great deal! No need for expensive mascaras. This one does a better job than many of the fancy brands in the market. Go for it!</li>
    <li> I love this product, and I continue to receive compliments everywhere. The purple is really bright and exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> More like purple. Expected blue mascara</li>
    <li> Price is great ! Very few mascara&#x27;s are made in blue...packs a lot of value...</li>
    <li> Perfect color. Applies easily. All ready know five people intersted in buying product.</li>
    <li> This will def make your eyes pop in every way. Be careful mascara solution is very liquidy and messy, but just wipe of the brush as you pull out so the excess comes off. Fun mascara, get many many compliments!</li>
    <li> I ONLY WEAR BLUE MASCARA, SINCE I WAS 18 YOA. GOOD BLUE IS HARD TO FIND. I FOUND IT. IGET ALOT OF COMPLIMENTS, OF COURSE I TELL THEM WHERE I PURCHASED IT. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I bought this for other granddaughter...liked it...she had gotten one other for her birthday, but like this mascara the best</li>
    <li> this is a great product I absolutly love it! it brightens my eyes and overall is a great blue! I would deffinitly recomend this to anyone whos looking for a awesome blue mascara!</li>
    <li> not as vibrant as I would have liked but it&#x27;s more visible in the sun. I don&#x27;t hate it but it&#x27;s nothing to write home about if you have dark lashes.</li>
    <li> The mascara actually comes on pretty much as blue as it appears in the tube without having to put very much on or be under bright lights. Other colored mascaras I&#x27;ve used have appeared almost black once the mascara dries with perhaps a bit of color in certain lighting (such as camera flash or facing the Sun). It doesn&#x27;t lengthen or give volume to the lashes (from what I&#x27;ve seen), but that is not what I purchased it for. I believe someone mentioned that it had paint-like smell but it actually smells more like sun block. I wouldn&#x27;t worry too much about the smell given that you have to hold the wand or the tube up to your nose to smell it and you won&#x27;t be able to smell it once it&#x27;s on your eyes. The consistency of the mascara itself is decent and appears to hold the curl of the lashes well. Overall I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I like this mascara and it&#x27;s like an electric blue but it still doesn&#x27;t show up enough for me to justify buying a blue mascara.  But it&#x27;s fun!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Great buy and not easy to find! So happy the price was right and so was the product! yay!!!!</li>
    <li> I like the color of this! it arrived on time and was exactly as described. It is a good one that doesnt get itchy or burny as the day passes</li>
    <li> Love this shade of blue</li>
    <li> Love this, it&#x27;s bright. That&#x27;s perfect for my dark lashes. .</li>
    <li> Pretty and BLUE! I really like the color of this mascara. It doesn&#x27;t go on clumpy. It actually has a nice clean finish. I have blue eyes and this mascara definitely accents my eyes. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> My wife has been looking for this color for a while and I found it here on Amazon and it made her day.</li>
    <li> On the brush it looks super bright but once I placed it on my lashed you couldn&#x27;t see anything. I guess it might work if you have light color eye lashes.</li>
