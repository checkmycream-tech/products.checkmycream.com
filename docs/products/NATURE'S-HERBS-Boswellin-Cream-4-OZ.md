      <li>But for a lot of them it&#x27;s more about the distraction caused by the heat of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boswellin</li>
      <li>love the smell ....</li>
      <li>I buy it from amazon because they are a more reliable source than my healthfood store and the price is lower.</li>
      <li>Want to order more.</li>

      <li>the first full nights sleep</li>

      <li>This product is very effective for instant relief of pain in my knees, back and neck area.  </li>
      <li>The smell is so strong that it will fill up a room and last for 3-4 hours.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care much for the menthol smell, but others don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
      <li>The smell is not offensive or medicinal while unusual.  </li>
      <li>Yes I was very please with this product..</li>
      <li>I have found that as I get toward the end of the tube it is helpful and economical to cut open the tube to retrieve the creame still captured within the container.</li>
      <li>I like this product because it is absorbed into the skin quickly and relief comes in a few minutes.  </li>
      <li>products and would like to keep up with new products</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it on sore joints and find it always produces the right amount of warming - not too hot and very long lasting.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting -- probably something which really built more on the boswellia herb rather than the menthol ingredient of similar \\&quot;A-bomb\\&quot; type products.</li>
      <li>I babysit my one year old grandson</li>
      <li>and he&#x27;s super active.  </li>
      <li>Rubbed some of this on my aching back, it was better in just a few minutes.</li>
      <li>Other than these problems (which are minor if you&#x27;re in pain), this product is a useful weapon in the fight against pain.</li>

    <li> Overall, Boswellin Cream is a very good pain reliever similar to a strong Bengay but somewhat better. The only problems, in my opinion, are the somewhat unpleasant smell and skin reactions. The smell is so strong that it will fill up a room and last for 3-4 hours. Also, after about 5 days I developed a small skin rash where applied. So I stopped for a few days and it went away. Other than these problems (which are minor if you&#x27;re in pain), this product is a useful weapon in the fight against pain. So if you&#x27;re in pain this will temporarily help. I believe this is one of the better applications for pain relief.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well on my knee .... love the smell .... very pleased with this purchase and will probably be back for more.</li>
    <li> Good for aches , nothing more severe</li>
    <li> After years of being a teacher and camp director I suffer from occasional knee and back pain. I&#x27;ve tried so many different creams and lotions I could probably support my own landfill with the bottles. Some of them work a little bit or for a short time. But for a lot of them it&#x27;s more about the distraction caused by the heat of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boswellin has anti inflamatory properties and the relief that Boswellin Cream provides sort of supports that. As an example, I&#x27;ve had a pretty bad lower back pain flare-up since the beginning of July. I&#x27;d done all the usual things, including other creams, aceteminophen, hot baths, cold packs etc. Last night I remembered that I had some of the Boswellin Cream and I had the first full nights sleep I&#x27;ve had in months; no pain. I&#x27;m here at work now sitting comfortably several hours into my day.</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve suffered with chronic pain.  This product is very effective for instant relief of pain in my knees, back and neck area.  I would recommend for quick relief.</li>
    <li> I have used Boswellin cream for years.  Helps with pain</li>
    <li> My husband and I have used  Boswellin cream for a number of years.  The product works miracles on my husband back,and&lt;br /&gt;keeps my shoulder pain free!</li>
    <li> I take Boswellia pills for anti-inflammatory purposes, and was happy to see a Boswellin cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it BUT my only hesitation is that the Capsacin scent is very strong. This may bother some (it bothers my husband). If the scent were not so strong, I would give it 5 stars.  It does help and do what it says it can do.</li>
    <li> This product is consistently effective. I&#x27;ve used it on sore joints and find it always produces the right amount of warming - not too hot and very long lasting. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Does a great job helping sore,stiff,achy joints and is a helpful analgesic for sore muscles as well.  The smell is not offensive or medicinal while unusual.  It does&#x27;nt seem to be drying to the skin.  I have found that as I get toward the end of the tube it is helpful and economical to cut open the tube to retrieve the creame still captured within the container.</li>
    <li> My family has used this product for 8 years. We try others but nothing else works as well.</li>
    <li> Nice to find a product that performs \\&quot;as advertised\\&quot;.  No side effects, eases muscle and joint pain almost immediately.  I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for about a month now for relief from bursitis in my one hip.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I have arthritis and this cream helps a lot when the pain strikes. Be advised, though, that this cream contains capsaicin so, if you have sensitivity to red pepper then this is not for you.</li>
    <li> This is a great relief for sore muscles. It gets hot and stays hot for quite a good while. Better than a lot of the pain relief rubs on the store shelves. I have been using it for several years since I found it in the healthfood store. I buy it from amazon because they are a more reliable source than my healthfood store and the price is lower.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is absorbed into the skin quickly and relief comes in a few minutes.  I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Yes I was very please with this product..I have used this product for some time and found it very good.</li>
    <li> The best cream I have try. Instant relief for pain.&lt;br /&gt;I have an inflamed Aquiles tendon and it helps 100%</li>
    <li> I use this daily for my shoulder pain.</li>
    <li> Sometimes older ingredients are better.  This cream contains frankincense,  and they weren&#x27;t called the wise men for nothing.  This is a great pain reliever. When rubbed in it can relieve my pain so I can get 4 hours sleep.  My pain could keep me up all night so this is amazing to me. The only negative for me is that the cream can stain clothing.</li>
    <li> This cream didn&#x27;t do anything for my arthritis pain. It might help someone else, but it didn&#x27;t do a thing for me. I ended up calling it a loss and throwing it away.</li>
    <li> Love it and very pleased with this product.  Want to order more. products and would like to keep up with new products</li>
    <li> quite disappointed with this cream.  It does nothing to help any pain.  Doesn&#x27;t even make the area warm or cool.....save your money.</li>
    <li> Does a great job of natural pain relief with no side effects. I wish it wasn&#x27;t so insanely expensive and hard to find is why I give it four stars, mostly for the cost factor.</li>
    <li> I have arthritus in both shoulders from torn ac joints, and this cream works better than prescription pain killers and arthritus medication.  The great thing about this cream is I&#x27;ll use it a couple of days and the pain goes away for months without needing to use the cream constantly.</li>
    <li> Yes i bought this because my friend told me it was good for her pain in her kness &#x27;so i tryed it was alright did not help as much as i thought it would ;it does have a very slight odor to it but does not last to long .i might help some but everyone is different .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting -- probably something which really built more on the boswellia herb rather than the menthol ingredient of similar \\&quot;A-bomb\\&quot; type products.</li>
    <li> Very effective in treating pain naturally</li>
    <li> Rubbed some of this on my aching back, it was better in just a few minutes. Try it you will like it.</li>
    <li> Works as well as anything else. I don&#x27;t care much for the menthol smell, but others don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
    <li> This is my second tube of Natures Herbs Boswellin Cream.  All I can say is it works I don&#x27;t even need to take medication.  I use before I go to bed sleep like a lamb.  Then, i use in the Mornings before I get up to get moving.  I also, use it in the middle of the day.  I babysit my one year old grandson and he&#x27;s super active.  I recommend this product to anyone who need pain/stiffness relief.</li>
    <li> Boswellin does help for hour or 2 then wears off!! Its very soothing makes my knees feel good!!! Im happy with it :)</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several weeks now, and it works for me.  It masks the pain in as little as ten minutes after I rub it on.</li>
