      <li>Well worth the price!!!</li>
      <li>This blower has good heating ability and has a strong air flow.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been blow drying my hair for over 25 years and this blower is by far the best one I&#x27;ve yet to use!</li>
      <li>Strong power and can blow hair in 1/2 the time!  </li>
      <li>On top of that, I lived in a warm climate where I seemed to be better off just letting nature do its thing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I took the moment out to talk with a stylist about the twin turbo 3200.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>It is pricey compared to retail dryers but its performance is outstanding.</li>
      <li>love this hair dryer.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>and it was definitely better.  </li>
      <li>I loved the first one and had it for many years.  </li>
      <li>Great quality, easy to use, heats up fast with lots of power.</li>
      <li>Great blower for professional work...</li>
      <li>Product was fine but returned it, vendor worked with me</li>
      <li>The box was not sealed, though the packaging inside was fine.</li>
      <li>I have finally found a dryer that can tackle my mane (lol).</li>
      <li>Overall the hairblower is great.  </li>
      <li>I rate the dryer 4 stars primarily for these reasons:  </li>
      <li>it is very powerful, so it&#x27;s help you with the speed working......</li>
      <li>It was completely worth it!</li>
      <li>Worth the money!</li>
      <li>Powerful!</li>
      <li>It is powerful and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It opens your cuticles for your natural oil to come out this when your cuticles are close without over drying your hair instead it keeps the moisture in the hair and all you see is shiny bounce healthy sexy hair .</li>
      <li>but when I used the dryer, it didn&#x27;t do anything special for my hair at all.</li>
      <li>so I need a powerful blow dryer that&#x27;s light.</li>
      <li>This serves the purpose it&#x27;s powerful, light and hat.</li>
      <li>Best part is that you can have it repaired if / when it breaks, usually for $25!</li>
      <li>For someone at home it should last years, but it is heavier than most at home dryers, definitely  more of a salon quality dryer.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it gets as hot as the Elchim dryer my hairdresser uses, so my hair never looks as smooth as I want.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased and would definitely recommend this product to anyone that is looking to splurge on a hair dryer.</li>
      <li>Great blow dryer, cuts my time in half.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair (but a lot of it) that is very prone to frizzing.  </li>
      <li>I was concerned that this blower would be too powerful on the circuit breaker, but no problem whatsoever.....</li>
      <li>I tried using blow dryers years ago but stopped because the length of time is took and the damage that it was causing to my hair wasnt worth it.  </li>
      <li>This is a professional hair dryer that works with hair stylist is better than ever</li>
      <li>It is so powerful, that it dries my hair in no time.  </li>
      <li>This is a powerful blower.</li>
      <li>It is worth the price.</li>
      <li>Perfect, drys my very thick and wavy hair super fast and for the first time ever I don&#x27;t need a straightener afterwards to smooth it out.  </li>
      <li>When it comes to pressing this is the best tool to use for the pressing to last other tools are not like this one .  </li>
      <li>It is way too powerful and gets way way way too hot.</li>
      <li>My gym has this same dryer and I was happy to find the same exact product on Amazon that I can use at home.  </li>
      <li>This is my second Twin Turbo and I truly love it.  </li>
      <li>The first one I ordered was suppose to include the diffuzer.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>The first shipment came without a diffuzer.</li>
      <li>This is an awesome blowdryer - it has cut my &amp;#34;getting ready&amp;#34; time by at least a third!</li>
      <li>My hair is long and it takes no time at all to dry and looks great.</li>
      <li>I still have to use a hot comb &amp; bumpers to get my hair straight.</li>
      <li>they are pure quality.</li>
      <li>Fast Drying?  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
      <li>This dryer really helps keep it straight without frying it.  </li>
      <li>Fast and helpful used them before would use them again</li>
      <li>The cord is straight, not coiled.  </li>
      <li>I was using a chi rocket, and this is much easier for me to use.</li>
      <li>I will continue to purchase this product as long as it&#x27;s available.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;Switch doesn&#x27;t get hot like in the old dryer&lt;br</li>
      <li>The amount of &#x27;hair static&#x27; effect seems reduced vs. my previous hairdryer.  </li>
      <li>My hair felt smooth and soft, but it didn&#x27;t necessarily look that way.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s high praise.</li>
      <li>The unit is a bit heavier than I expected, but the weight is balanced so handling is fine.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it occasionally and it dries my medium cut hair within 60 seconds to a nice half-dry-half-damp consistency (just the way I like it), so that my hair can be combed and dry naturally into a shape,</li>
      <li>This blow dryer does dry your hair more quickly than the average blow dryer.</li>
      <li>I use to buy the department store regular hair dryers and my hair was never as smooth as I want, I had to flat iron a lot.</li>
      <li>However, be advised:  The owner&#x27;s manual/manufacturer&#x27;s warranty included with the product--and the manufacturer&#x27;s web site--both clearly state that the normal 1 year product warranty is void if the product is purchased from Amazon.</li>
      <li>This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve bought and the first from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d be interested to hear if anyone else had the same experience.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quieter than I expected even at full speed.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a professional hairdresser</li>
      <li>This is professional quality , she uses it at home and for work as well.</li>
      <li>so far</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally curly</li>
      <li>My stylist had recommended it to me but the price was outrageous, good thing I found it in Amazon at a more reasonable price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Arrive on time, good product</li>
    <li> Wow, I was skeptical about this dryer actually making a difference, but it makes a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s heavy and the cord is really long and stiff, but that also means it&#x27;s very well made.</li>
    <li> Great blow dryer, cuts my time in half.</li>
    <li> Great blow dryer! Dries my hair very fast and no more frizz!</li>
    <li> Very happy it&#x27;s work perfectl.</li>
    <li> love this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been blow drying my hair for over 25 years and this blower is by far the best one I&#x27;ve yet to use! My stylist had recommended it to me but the price was outrageous, good thing I found it in Amazon at a more reasonable price. This is actually the second one I buy, first one for myself and second one for my grandmother! I recommend this item to all ladies who wish to finish their hair drying ordeal well and faster!</li>
    <li> Love it. Exactly what I wanted. No frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> Best blow dryer I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome blowdryer - it has cut my &amp;#34;getting ready&amp;#34; time by at least a third! Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> My sister-in-law is a hair stylist and swears by this brand but when I used the dryer, it didn&#x27;t do anything special for my hair at all. In fact, it made it look so flat and left my hair without any body.  My hair felt smooth and soft, but it didn&#x27;t necessarily look that way. Even on the highest setting there&#x27;s not a whole lot of power, it blows less air and doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my previous dryer - I had an Elchim and it was definitely better.  Not sure if the wattage has much to do with it, this is 1875 and my Elchim was 2000.  But the 1875 should be fine for my hair since it&#x27;s normal and not too thick. If you want the flat, straight-ironed look and have thicker hair, this might work for you.  For the price I paid, I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  For the record, my sister-in-law&#x27;s dryer performs much differently, even though it&#x27;s the exact same model.  That makes me suspicious that perhaps this was a refurbished dryer or maybe even a fake if that&#x27;s even possible. The box was not sealed, though the packaging inside was fine. I&#x27;d be interested to hear if anyone else had the same experience.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve bought and the first from Amazon.  I loved the first one and had it for many years.  I paid less with amazon for this one and even though the first one hadn&#x27;t stopped working it started to smell \\&quot;hot\\&quot; and I didn&#x27;t want to take a chance.  I will continue to purchase this product as long as it&#x27;s available.  My hair is long and it takes no time at all to dry and looks great.</li>
    <li> This is a professional hair dryer that works with hair stylist is better than ever I guess...Because I didn&#x27;t hear any complaint or comments from my wife so far!</li>
    <li> Great blower for professional work... I recommend it..... it is very powerful, so it&#x27;s help you with the speed working......</li>
    <li> Product was fine but returned it, vendor worked with me</li>
    <li> Powerful! I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a powerful blower. It shortens the drying time, and it is not that noisy, well if I compare it to the one I had for 4 years. Great quality. I am please my Dominican hair stylist recommended to me. I definitely recommend it to you. It is worth the price.</li>
    <li> When it comes to pressing this is the best tool to use for the pressing to last other tools are not like this one .  It opens your cuticles for your natural oil to come out this when your cuticles are close without over drying your hair instead it keeps the moisture in the hair and all you see is shiny bounce healthy sexy hair . I love it</li>
    <li> Great blow dryer! I have very thin and fine hair and I swear that using this dryer helps with volume and texture of my hair. My sister is a professional stylist and uses this dryer, once I tried it, I had to get it and have not been disappointed.</li>
    <li> The attachment does not stay on. I had to use Velcro to keep it attached. Otherwise it flies off every time I turn it on. I don&#x27;t think it gets as hot as the Elchim dryer my hairdresser uses, so my hair never looks as smooth as I want.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my cousin and she loves it, she says it&#x27;s and excellent hair dryer and works very well</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended it.  It is powerful and easy to use.  I love it.  No problems getting my hair to dry without frizz</li>
    <li> these hairdryers make great gifts.  they are pure quality.</li>
    <li> Pricy, but quality. I&#x27;m a stylist and I buy a few of these a year (always need a back-up). I&#x27;m very hard on my equipment and these hold up to being dropped and used for hours and hours... For someone at home it should last years, but it is heavier than most at home dryers, definitely  more of a salon quality dryer. Best part is that you can have it repaired if / when it breaks, usually for $25!</li>
    <li> I have finally found a dryer that can tackle my mane (lol). It take less time to dry my hair with out burning it. I&#x27;m glad I took the moment out to talk with a stylist about the twin turbo 3200.</li>
    <li> My better half is a professional stylist so this dryer gets heavy use. This is her third in about 8 years. Given that it,probably runs 20 hours a week I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s high praise. Fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent hair dryer and a well-made product.  However, be advised:  The owner&#x27;s manual/manufacturer&#x27;s warranty included with the product--and the manufacturer&#x27;s web site--both clearly state that the normal 1 year product warranty is void if the product is purchased from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is my second Twin Turbo and I truly love it.  It is pricey compared to retail dryers but its performance is outstanding. It gives my hair volume and never over dries.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this product met all of my expectations and surpassed them. the item is quality personified and would definitely do business again!</li>
    <li> Best christmas gift ever!!!  Strong power and can blow hair in 1/2 the time!  Absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> Best hairdryer I have ever had</li>
    <li> Great quality, easy to use, heats up fast with lots of power. It&#x27;s well worth the money invested when you need to replace your outdated blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how long I have been needlessly been walking around with frizzy hair due to those cheap $20 hair dryers sold from retail pharmacies and stores.  I have been impressed by the results.  My hair is softer and NO FRIZZ.  This blower has good heating ability and has a strong air flow.  What good is the heating without good flow.  The drying time is shorter....it used to take me 17 minutes but now it only takes me 12 or so minutes.  My only complaint is that the attachment falls off easily.  I was concerned that this blower would be too powerful on the circuit breaker, but no problem whatsoever.....I even leave the TV on.  I recommend this blower without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Fast and helpful used them before would use them again I choose them over my pro distributer that all folks</li>
    <li> Best purchase EVER!!! Well worth the price!!! I have very thick hair and this cut my drying time by 30 minutes...</li>
    <li> Fast Drying?  YES! This blow dryer does dry your hair more quickly than the average blow dryer. My hair holds alot of water so I was impressed by the quick fry time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: That&#x27;s about it. It does Not straighten my hair. After blow drying it dry I still have to use a hot comb &amp; bumpers to get my hair straight. This blow dryer is Nothing like the ones the Dominican &#x27; s use. That was what I was looking for :(</li>
    <li> I am hispanic and the texture of my hair has always been thick and wavy and it didnt help that I have always kept it long (down passed my bra strap). I tried using blow dryers years ago but stopped because the length of time is took and the damage that it was causing to my hair wasnt worth it.  On top of that, I lived in a warm climate where I seemed to be better off just letting nature do its thing. Needless to say, I wore my hair up a lot. Now, I live in a cold environment where going outside with wet hair is not comfortable. I bought this dryer in hopes that I wouldn&#x27;t have the same issues I did when I tried blow drying previously.  From start to finish, it took a total of 7 minutes to dry my hair and it was on the meduim setting, not the high one. I am very pleased and would definitely recommend this product to anyone that is looking to splurge on a hair dryer. It was completely worth it!</li>
    <li> It dries hair, just like advertized.  The amount of &#x27;hair static&#x27; effect seems reduced vs. my previous hairdryer.  The unit is a bit heavier than I expected, but the weight is balanced so handling is fine.  It&#x27;s quieter than I expected even at full speed.  The cord is longer than needed in my personal situation, I find a cord that long just gets in the way.  The cord is straight, not coiled.  The big block thing at the end of the cord (vs. just an AC power plug) I find a nuisance since my power outlets are already GFCI-type outlets. Basic controls are fan &amp; heat: 2 fan speeds + off &amp; 2 temperatures + off.  The number of temperature settings advertized is a bit misleading - (&amp;#34;4 temperatures&amp;#34; is actually achieved by a combination of temperature switch &amp; fan switch settings.)  Instructions (for English anyway) are generally lacking, but with a bit of experimentation one can figure out how to work it.  I rate the dryer 4 stars primarily for these reasons:  The &amp;#34;Removeable stainless filter&amp;#34; is a nice feature so hair clogs on the inlet can be removed, but getting it all back in place is not easy, it takes careful manipulation because the parts are not finely fitted and they bind easily (at least on my unit.)  Because of the binding and poor fit, I was afraid of breaking something in the precess of putting it back together after cleaning the filter.  The ad says: &amp;#34;Includes concentrator&amp;#34; - I assume this is supposed to be an attachment to put on the nozzle, my unit did NOT come with any extra parts.  All things considered I think it&#x27;s overpriced and in some ways the ad is misleading.  I do intend to keep it, but will shop around again if I ever need another.</li>
    <li> Great price, great item. She loves it. This is professional quality , she uses it at home and for work as well.</li>
    <li> Perfect, drys my very thick and wavy hair super fast and for the first time ever I don&#x27;t need a straightener afterwards to smooth it out.  I do wish it came with a diffuser though.</li>
    <li> My gym has this same dryer and I was happy to find the same exact product on Amazon that I can use at home.  It is so powerful, that it dries my hair in no time.  Love it.  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I use to buy the department store regular hair dryers and my hair was never as smooth as I want, I had to flat iron a lot. This dryer is amazing. Takes all the work out of blow drying. You can see the steam of water as you dry. Be careful it is high heat, but will dry your hair in half the time and you need very little flat ironing.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS HAIR DRYER.  I have very thick, strong, long hair, and this dryer BURNED OFF MY HAIR.  It is way too powerful and gets way way way too hot. I now have a giant chuck out my hair on one side. It also burned the plastic tips of my round brush. Disaster.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair (but a lot of it) that is very prone to frizzing.  This dryer really helps keep it straight without frying it.  I was using a chi rocket, and this is much easier for me to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional hairdresser so I need a powerful blow dryer that&#x27;s light. This serves the purpose it&#x27;s powerful, light and hat. Six of the seven stylists in our salon use it do I guess there&#x27;s nothing else to say.</li>
    <li> Overall the hairblower is great.  The first one I ordered was suppose to include the diffuzer.  The first shipment came without a diffuzer. Wrote the company and they immediately sent another one out (within 2 days). The second one didn&#x27;t have the diffuzer with it either.  I went back to the ad and it said with diffuzer.  So I have requested another return and pickup and asked them not to resend another one.  My hair is naturally curly and I need the diffuzer.  Yes I can buy a diffuzer anywheres, but since I paid for it with this one, I shouldn&#x27;t have to go buy one. Not sure what they call a diffuzer, but the round flat attachment is not a diffuzer.  The big round attachment is what I call a diffuzer. Sorry we won&#x27;t get burnt three times.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved it!  Ordered a second one  I liked it so well.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Mom. She has lots of long thick hair and complained that the old hair dryer took too long and didn&#x27;t accomplish the job. This hair dryer worked for her well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it occasionally and it dries my medium cut hair within 60 seconds to a nice half-dry-half-damp consistency (just the way I like it), so that my hair can be combed and dry naturally into a shape, otherwise my hair would be too puffed up if dried all the way.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews and recommendations, professions use these dryers in salons and they prefer them. I&#x27;d have to agree, spend a little extra and enjoy quality product you want to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;Switch doesn&#x27;t get hot like in the old dryer&lt;br /&gt;Dries hair consistently&lt;br /&gt;Durable construction&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable to use&lt;br /&gt;More quiet than cheaper dryers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;None so far</li>
