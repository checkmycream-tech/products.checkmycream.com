      <li>For the winter it gives that wonderful extra moisture whenever my face feels dry.  </li>

      <li>It is exactly as I remember it.  </li>
      <li>:&amp;#34;)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use any other NuSkin products, but this I use morning and night kind of like a serum before I put (or don&#x27;t put) a moisturizer on my face.</li>
      <li>I used this years ago and I am now back for a tried and true product!  </li>
      <li>While it certainly won&#x27;t hurt oily or acne afflicted skin</li>
      <li>Its one of those products I will make certain I never run out of.</li>
      <li>I really, really was up in the air with this.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs very well to skin, not sticky nor oily.</li>
      <li>It seemed no matter how much lotion or baby oil</li>

    <li> Amazing!!!! It is the best moisturizing what I used. So  I&#x27;ll use this product forever! Amazing!!!! It is the best moisturizing what I used. So  I&#x27;ll use this product forever!</li>
    <li> Good to put on before your moisturizer and while using their gels, which I do at least 2x weekly.</li>
    <li> Lotions usually make me break out, but ever since I&#x27;ve switched to this moisture mist, I haven&#x27;t had any major breakouts unless Aunt Flo comes to visit. lol. Only a few spritz and it really goes a long way, I always spray it before bed and wake up with the softest skin. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> good product, very light moisture with little or no scent to compete with (my) scented lotions.</li>
    <li> makes my face wet-nothing else</li>
    <li> I live in Los Angeles so it&#x27;s dry here, 24/7.  After living in the humid south for the past eight years, moving to LA was a big shock to my skin.  I needed something to add moisture to my skin throughout the day and this Nu Skin Moisture spray does the job.  The spray is a nice, light, mist which means I don&#x27;t have to worry about big droplets of moisture affecting my makeup when I apply it during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent much, much more on moisturizing sprays, so I love that I can get what I need at this price.  It smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing, doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Truly scent free so it&#x27;s great to have a bottle at the office where the air is oh so dry.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product and a great value</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with Nu Skin Napca. I bought it to replace Twin Labs&lt;br /&gt;Napca, since they began adding additional, annoying ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;This mist is very moisturizing and refreshing to my skin. I will continue&lt;br /&gt;to purchase it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for on the go. I have very dry skin and a bottle last about 2 months.</li>
    <li> I totally fell in love with this. I don&#x27;t use any other NuSkin products, but this I use morning and night kind of like a serum before I put (or don&#x27;t put) a moisturizer on my face. Fresh-looking glowing skin. Totally worth buying.</li>
    <li> Have used this product before. It is a very refreshing spray that works on clean skin or over makeup. Just spray lightly to hydrate skin.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for me here in Riverside Ca. The mist on my face is refreshing and when the Sana Annas start gusting I mist my hair and it does not frizz. I&#x27;m getting another bottle for my downstairs bathroom. If they had a purse size I&#x27;d buy that.</li>
    <li> Love this!! Makes my skin feel great</li>
    <li> I tried this moisture mist on a whim, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I love this stuff!  I spray it on with a quick spritz after I&#x27;ve applied all my makeup to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; everything and to give my skin a slightly dewy finish.  The mist is super-fine, and my makeup doesn&#x27;t run at all, but like I said, I only use a short, quick spray.  One bottle lasts for a couple of months when used like this.  I&#x27;ll be buying this product again and again.</li>
    <li> This is just what my skin needed. It seemed no matter how much lotion or baby oil I used, my skin (face) was always dry and dull.  Not anymore. This stuff really works and if you put baby oil over it, it lasts even longer. True to what the product says, brings moisture to the skin and helps it keep moisture as well. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this mist.  Will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> If you use this item, your skin will be moist all day wrong. I am very old but my skin fells like rejuvenated all day wrong.</li>
    <li> I thought this mist was doing a pretty good job until I got a facial and the esthetician was unable to do some of the regular work she does on my skin due to extreme dryness.  I might use this as a sealer or but don&#x27;t recommend it as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It works well with the machine.</li>
    <li> Great product for setting makeup, giving my hair a light dose of moisture (without making it greasy or heavy), and perfect for the mid&#x3D;day pick-me-up my skin needs.</li>
    <li> I live in a desert climate and the mist works very well to keep my skin moist.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> It keeps my skin balanced. I use it every day. I went to a talk and Mariel Hemmingway actually said she liked this product, so of course my friends and I went out and purchased it. It is really fantastic!</li>
    <li> Wife loved it at 20% of store cost.</li>
    <li> It absorbs very well to skin, not sticky nor oily. Very light texture. I apply it very often during the day. Keeps your skin very moist.</li>
    <li> I love Nu Skin products. This is a must have for summer and winter. One spray and your skin will thank you!!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favourite.</li>
    <li> The spray is not working.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted. Refreshing Lil spritz and really is unscented!  Gives my face, body and hair a Lil moisture that is perfect in this AZ hot season!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Heaven in itchy Idaho!!  at night i wake up all itchy.  I have a back scratcher but tit isn&#x27;t enough.  Spritz a little of this on and I can sleep again!  Lovely, not sticky - just right.</li>
    <li> I love it and will buy more!</li>
    <li> This product is great!  Spray on face to add coolness.....Spray on hair to revive waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can just be used in balmy weather to cool you down......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using Moisture mist for years and keep extra bottles on hand for gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended highly.....  :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nu skin moisture mist for 6 years, keep reordering it.  I put one in my bathroom for before and after makeup, plus one in my car for dry and air-conditioning environment.  Love it so much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 20 years. Really does a great job keeping a youthful appearance.</li>
    <li> this is awesome, i have very oily skin and a lot of face creams even the light ones are heavy. this does the trick. just enough moisture!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i hope they never stop making this !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Calming, moisturizing toner.  I love this fragrance free moisturizing toner.  I like the fine mist that I can spray directly on my face.  I have rosacea and it&#x27;s perfect for it, it tones but doesn&#x27;t strip or irritate my extremely sensitive skin.  I mist my face, 2-3 pumps then pat it in, then I am able to apply about 1/3 to a half of a normal moisturizer portion, so it helps me extend a bottle of expensive moisturizer. I purchased this for $8.75 a bottle and I am glad I stocked up since it&#x27;s now $12.00 a bottle.  It&#x27;s a great product for me but I will continue to shop around for a  friendlier price.  I am a skin care connoisseur, I have had to become one to find products that will tame and calm my extremely sensitive rosacea affected Skin!  You can&#x27;t go wrong with purchasing this toner if you are in the market for a toner that will work on Super Sensitive Skin or ANY skin type.  While it certainly won&#x27;t hurt oily or acne afflicted skin and you never want to use alcohol on your skin, this product may be a little to light for such skin types.  I hope this review helps someone. :&amp;#34;)</li>
    <li> This product is necessary when used with the nu skin galvanic spa treatment. I tried using only distilled water but found better results with the moisture mist.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without it--the best toner for my skin type.  I have sun-damaged, combination, sensitive skin.  My skin feels clean and soothed after a wash; not chemical-y at all.</li>
    <li> Bravo. Excellent for mature skin and hair&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products and this works&lt;br /&gt;And works right away no waiting weeks on end</li>
    <li> My skin is so dry and I love this mist so much!  I used this years ago and I am now back for a tried and true product!  You will love it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT BECAUSE IT IS WHAT i HAD EXPECT IT HAD TO BE.&lt;br /&gt;It is a wonderful mist . I love it</li>
    <li> Nice to have this to help set make up and/or mitigate the drying effects of having the heat on. I won&#x27;t go without something like this anymore, and I would recommend this particular mist.</li>
    <li> I was first using twinlabs na pca until I found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t as sticky as twinlabs which is only stick for a few minutes but still counts in rush situations&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t burn eyes if a little gets in like twinlabs does&lt;br /&gt;also has hyaluronic acid&lt;br /&gt;absorbs faster&lt;br /&gt;overall better ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;costs more than 2x as much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I tried na pca I had to have a spray constantly because it&#x27;s so refreshing and hydrating to the skin.  If you are strapped for cash get the twinlabs product but if you can afford it get this one because it&#x27;s way better.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin or the hydration. The one thing I do like about it though is that its a good after shave on your legs to calm razor burn. So for that, I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I am hooked on this spray, it is wonderful.  For the winter it gives that wonderful extra moisture whenever my face feels dry.  In summer, its fantastic in cooling the face without feeling oily.  Every time I spritz my face I am refreshed, it is a blessing on so many levels, seriously.  I have been using pure argan oil around my eyes and lightly on face coupled with this spray and it is the perfect balance for me. I have combination skin which is considerably drier in winter and this spray seems to be the ticket in providing all of what my face would hope for.  I cannot recommend this enough.  Its one of those products I will make certain I never run out of.</li>
    <li> I used to sell this years ago, this was my favorite product of the Nuskin line, it is refreshing and feels great</li>
    <li> Good price for my face refreshing :)</li>
    <li> This is okay, but I prefer the Twinlab na-pca with aloe vera. I bought this to try as a replacement and I don&#x27;t think it moisturizes nearly as well as the twinlab.</li>
    <li> not helpful at all, feel like spraying water to my face plus the spay is way too much that when u done spraying, u face completely wet</li>
    <li> This product works with the gel capsules and makes my skin feel smooth.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I am on my 2nd bottle of this stuff. I do not know if it works but it makes my skin feel softer and I use it almost every day. I will keep using it and hope that it keeps my skin healthy. I purchased the cream as well.</li>
    <li> I find this to be an excellent product to use before applying my alpha hydroxy and moisturizer.  Sometimes I even spray it on my face first thing in the morning to refresh and wake me up!</li>
    <li> My oil, acne-prone skin is sensitive and this toner is one of my favorites because moisturizes without irritating. I also like that is it spray toner, thus saving on using cotton balls.</li>
    <li> It is exactly as I remember it.  It is the best product....  Just the right moisture without washing your face or smearing your make up</li>
    <li> I really, really was up in the air with this.  I kept coming back, and for the price, decided to go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Lovely smell&lt;br /&gt;Can be used on hair and body as a light fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;It is refreshing&lt;br /&gt;Can set make-up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;I did not find it was hydrating&lt;br /&gt;Some people say to pat in a mist to your skin or follow up with a lotion--I tried both and noticed it made my cc cream a little funky&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that if I sprayed more than twice it kinda broke my cc cream down&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why would I buy again?  I think I would buy it for its multiple uses [like I said, spray it in your hair!] and it IS refreshing.  If I am feeling tired I notice it kinda wakes me up.  I wanted a hydrating product but that is kinda hard to find. I ordered another mist from jolse.com and will see how that works once it finally gets here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is non-essential product.  I just liked it.  But if you are looking for a hydrator, then I do not think you will find it with this product.  I thought ten bucks is fine since the bottle is kind of big.  It will last a while, i think.</li>
    <li> I&amp;#34;ve used Napca for years, its a nice spritz of moisture</li>
    <li> I use it everyday after I apply my makeup. Wow!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this is the only product that calms it down.  I have used this for several years.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect facial &amp; body spray for use in hot, dry weather.  I keep it handy on the patio for quick sprays.</li>
