<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fairly good product, has a nice and refreshing smell to it!</li>
    <li> Enzymes in pineapple eat through dead skin layer. Love the smooth feeling of face afterward. Helps other topical products like moisturizers sink in better after this removal of dead skin layer.</li>
    <li> This product is all that it promises. It leaves your skin refreshed and clear. It is easy to use and washes off without scrubbing, unlike some masks. I don&#x27;t have super-sensitive skin...so I recommend using it every three days for vibrant results. Also: I have left the product on my face and neck twice as long as the recommended length of time, without any irritation at all. I&#x27;m really happy with Freeman&#x27;s (Pineapple) facial enzyme mask.</li>
    <li> I never have the time to keep this on for the full ten minutes, but my skin is always soft and glowy even if I just leave it on for 3-5 minutes.  My husband says that I have a certain glow and people notice something different about me but they can&#x27;t figure what it is.  I compared the ingredients in this to the $85 \\&quot;Kate in a Jar\\&quot; by Kate Somerville, and the active ingredients are mainly the same.  I consider my skin to be pretty sensitive, and I am pleased to say that this product has not irritated my skin at all, no breakouts, no redness.</li>
    <li> I bought this mask to try and bring back a healthy glow to my dry, flaky skin this winter. I&#x27;ve used other Freeman&#x27;s products before with great results and, once again, they didn&#x27;t disappoint!! This product is amazing!! After only 10 minutes, my skin looks very refreshed and vibrant. The dewy effect lasts for days too so I don&#x27;t have to apply it everyday and it smells great. Since using this product, I&#x27;ve received complements from my husband and many friends on how great my skin looks. I have very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation or breakouts whatsoever. I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants that yearned for dewy, glowing complection.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it about 4 times and have noticed a big reduction in the blackheads around my nose!  Very gentle, leaves my skin soft, moist and glowing!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of goopy and not a clay mask! Make sure you read it correctly if you are looking for clay. I STILL recommend using this because it&#x27;s worked better for me than any clay mask. It super moisturizes your face and is good for clearing up dry skin patches. I used it once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> * Freeman Pinapple Enzyme mask worked fine, but did irritate my skin alittle  * Both on my face and on the back of my legs as I exfoliate my entire body with it   * I leave on for the 10 minutes and then I soak a wash cloth in the juice of 1 lemon and 2 tsp sugar mixed  * Then I lightly scrub with the lemon soaked wash cloth to remove the dead skin cells each month  * A good find for the price, but I really wanted to try the pumpkin version but it was out at the time at the drugstore</li>
    <li> I have used Freeman products before and they have always been really great.  This product is fabulous as well.  I was going to have to spend a lot more for an enzyme mask from sephora but i think this works just as well, for a great price.   Excellent !!</li>
    <li> I think this a pretty good product. My face definitely feels smoother after I use it. I&#x27;m always looking for new exfoliators and I usually use ones with a mechanical action (ie: sugar scrubs) but this worked nicely too. I tried following it up with their goji berry hydrating mask but that was a terrible idea, it burned so much I had to wash it right off. I recommend letting your skin rest a bit before putting anything on after using this!</li>
    <li> I use this every other day and my skin is brighter and looks healthier.  Like that it doesn&#x27;t sting or cause redness even if left on too long.</li>
    <li> I love this one, despite a slightly strange smell to it. Nothing too overpowering or terrible. It works great though. Will continue to re-order.</li>
    <li> Good Product, Fast Delivery. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> My skin felt incredibly soft after using it! My 13 yr old used it on her feet with the same :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a wonderful product but apparently I&#x27;m allergic to Pineapple. (I just found out right after I ordered and used this. It took a little while to put 2 and 2 together). Some people are sensitive to bromelain, a protein in pineapple often used as a meat tenderizer. It makes sense why it would be an excellent exfoliate. My friend LOVES it.</li>
    <li> this is an amazing mask! it gives my skin a bright, glowy complexion and it helped diminish my pores! your skin looks so beautiful and healthy afterwards! a must-have!</li>
    <li> Love love love this!!!! Never stop making it ,makes my skin glow and look dewy.</li>
    <li> I love this mask!! I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in my city so I have to order it from amazon. But this product is amazing, it makes my face feel and look fabulous! And I have sensitive skin and it does not make my face break out.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! Five stars for: thoughtful packaging, fast delivery, delicious fragrance and after-use radiant skin!</li>
    <li> It is such a soft feeling gel that I wouldn&#x27;t think it would work so well. Luckily it smells good and has a cooling sensation so I used it. I found that it really works! I use it almost 4 times a week. I put it on and let it sit while I do my nightly routine, i.e. watch Amazon Prime (shoutout!). I had one before that had little beads in it, but I think I like the pure gel better. Sometimes I even leave it on a night and wash it off in the morning. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and actually leaves it feeling smooth and moisturized. I have been getting a lot of compliments on my usually troubled skin and I give a lot of credit to this mask... esp paired with my digestive enzymes and tamanu oil. The trifecta plan for anyone dealing with cystic acne.</li>
    <li> dont really see the point in this. i use it every once in a while now but when i first got it i used it a lot. never saw a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this mask. It makes my skin sooooo smooth after. And it&#x27;s easy to rinse off. Not like that mint juniper clay one....jeez the scrubbing you gotta do with that one will make ur face smooth with out even an application. This pineapple one is like a curdled gel....rinses away super easy.</li>
    <li> my husband and i really enjoyed this cleanser. very light and makes your face feel really fresh and rejuvenated. i would definetly recommend this product. good quality at a good price.</li>
    <li> this is so very gentle BUT effective. i have mildly oily but aged skin and this is perfect for balancing it out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased some fairly expensive beauty products in my lifetime so I wasn&#x27;t quite sure of what to expect of a product that was so cheap. Well I&#x27;m here to say that this mask is amazing and does exactly what it promises to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applying it to clean skin it feels a bit like lemon curd with a citrus scent. You just spread a thin layer over your face and then leave it on for the entire ten minutes. I did not feel any tingling or stinging but it did feel cooling. I suspect that is because this has peppermint oil in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When rinsing this off my face I did feel the granules in the gel but I don&#x27;t think they do anything. I washed off my face with a cloth and then splashed more water on to make sure everything was removed. When I looked in the mirror my skin looked a little more pink but not red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I put on moisturizer I then noticed how my skin was glowing and \\&quot;radiant\\&quot; is the correct word to describe the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the formula has changed and the container is a bit different than shown here at amazon. Instead of glycolic acid and chamomile, this now has aloe, pineapple fruit extrat, papaya fruit extrat, sea kelp, coconut, orange oil, grapefruit peel oil, lavender oil, peppermint oil and tea tree oil. There are also some artificial ingredients but I don&#x27;t feel like typing them all out. What matters is that this does contain some good natural ingredients too. I think you will be impressed with this mask. My skin is super soft and I think yours will be too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> I love freeman&#x27;s products and use them every day.  The natural ingredients are perfect for my extra sensitive skin, and make my skin oh so soft.  I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin! BUY FREEMAN PRODUCTS!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face mask. I use it once a week and it makes my skin sooo smooth. Amazon has it at a much lower price than WalMart also. Great deal on a great product.</li>
    <li> This product worked well at removing dead skin from my face. Did not dry out my skin at all.</li>
    <li> this is a great product, I used it for years but for the last year and a half i have a really hard time finding it anywhere. It leaves your skin soft and glowy and it doesnt cost a lot, except on amazon apparently at Ulta its only 3.22 on sale and 3.50 not on sale. Its a great product i do suggest it just wish it was easier to find, lately i was unable to find it at all and i&#x27;m not paying six dollars for it knowing that its available at a better price elsewhere. I found the alba botanica makes a whole line of pineapple beauty product and it works just as well and feels less goopy. but that price tag on those items makes me think i will be buying this again if i can find it.</li>
    <li> This has a nice light smell. After using it the first time, it left my skin feeling very smooth and left a glow. My skin felt quite healthy. I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have the time and don&#x27;t want to spend the money for a spa facial. This was easy and fun and did not sting. Am I beautiful? Did it take off 10 years. No, I&#x27;m still a senior citizen (female) who enjoys a fun facial in 10 minutes with a refreshing feel afterwards.</li>
    <li> Does make my face feel softer after use.</li>
    <li> Love it, works amazingly.</li>
    <li> I love this enzyme mask.  It&#x27;s really working.   The smell is soooo pineapple. You may think it&#x27;s cheap smell, but still it&#x27;s pineapple. (and it&#x27;s a cheap freeman mask anyway!)    I use this in the shower. Even though direction says to use it as mask, but I just massage with this in the shower and it&#x27;s perfectly working.   There are some scrub-like granules, but it&#x27;s not harsh at all.</li>
    <li> I love this! Such a fresh scent. This product I used once to twice a week. It smoothed my skin, gave it a healthy glow, felt supple. I personally didn&#x27;t experience any drying or irritation. I left it on for about 10 minutes as my last step to my skincare that day, and moisturized as usual. I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great mask for keeping skin smooth. I use 1-3 times a week as long as many other Freeman&#x27;s mask.</li>
    <li> Smells good but I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes</li>
    <li> I will never go to a beauty salon again !!! This mask smells awesome !! ...like a tropical paradise&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a absolute winner , my face loves it ...highly recommended</li>
    <li> If I had known I could have bought at any Walmart would have just gone there. Product was OK nothing really special</li>
    <li> The smell of this product sold me alone, it is a faint pineapple scent, not too powerful. The mask is a different consistency then i am use to but it left my skin soft and refreshed. I recommend ANY mask from Freeman.</li>
    <li> Mild and makes your skin feel clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> This product was supposed to reach me via UPS, however when I went to pick it up,  at UPS, the agent said the packaged had been compromised.  Never the less, I found this product at Ulta.  It is a great mask for home use.</li>
    <li> Very good for dry skin</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find mud masks anywhere anymore. Needed some stuff for a weekend campout with girls so I bought a bunch of different kind here. Not the best value but I needed clay masks.</li>
    <li> Fast delivvery, wworks wwell</li>
    <li> This item would&#x27;ve been better but it came unsealed and half empty.  I&#x27;m highly disappointed and I feel cheated!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smells great and leaves my skin exfoliated and soft. Best thing about this product is the price. I have bought a comparable product for $48 at a chain waxing place, used for exfoliation and this is just as good for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Really strong pineapple scent.. not my thing. like almost nauseating!! and the mask itself didnt really do any noticeable changes. I prefer peel-off masks.</li>
    <li> I used this on myself and my husband who has seborrheic dermatitis. It didn&#x27;t sting my sensitive skin, but he said he could definitely feel the tingle (though not unpleasant). It does have a good bit of texture to it, so I find it works best when you massage it on your face for a good minute or two before letting it sit and do its job. I also find that following it with a mild alpha or beta-hydroxy toner helps remove the dead skin the mask loosened up. For such an inexpensive product, it works pretty darn well.</li>
    <li> This product was highly recommended as a good and inexpensive home facial mask. I wasn&#x27;t knocked off my feet by the results, but do think it is a good product!!</li>
    <li> face feels smooth and rejuvenated and hydrated and shiny . I leave it on for 20 minutes!  i RECOMMENDED , SMELLS VERY GOOD!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I was hoping to try something new, I had tried other Freeman products and all had been wonderful. Unfortunately I hated the way this product felt on my skin, it&#x27;s very grainy and has a weird texture (very unlike their others which were smooth and silky). I didn&#x27;t care for the scent either. I&#x27;m not sure if it improved my skin because I only used it once. Thanks and hope you have better luck than me.</li>
    <li> I have terrible skin :(  My acne started at 13 and has never gone away (I&#x27;m 37 now).  I regularly see a dermatologist and have kept it tamed with the help of daily, prescription skin gels and lotions.  They&#x27;ve come a long way as far as redness and irritation as side effects go but it still happens nonetheless.  Every other enzyme mask or exfoliating cream/cleanser has proven to be too harsh for my super sensitive, medicated skin.  Freeman&#x27;s Pineapple Enzyme mask is the ONLY one that leaves my skin feeling refreshed and looking amazing.  I use it every 3-4 days and my skin is more radiant than ever.  Some of the discoloration left from years of acne has even disappeared.  You will NOT be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This product leaves my skin feeling very clean and refreshed.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to provide long-term effects, however I plan to continue use.</li>
    <li> This product could have been great if they didn&#x27;t use a recycle code 7 for their plastic tube. This code is known for being bad for you and may cause chromosonal damage.  Zero stars for this product.</li>
    <li> I love this mask. Makes your skin bright. It improves the overall skin condition. Highly recommend it. I use it twice a week.</li>
    <li> I accidentaly left it on for 30 minutes instead of 15 and my face felt burnt/was stinging for a couple of days</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself. I did nothing it says it would, and I used it twice per week until the bottle was empty. I will not purchase again, nor do I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love all Freeman masks!  I have every one and use them regularly!  This one works well and smells great!</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s clogging your pores or burning your face off.  It smells clean, rinses clean, and leaves you with a fresh feeling as if you did a more intense face regimen.  I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s going to take away wrinkles, close your pores, and take 20 years off your life because NO beauty product truly does that.  But for the low price you&#x27;re going to pay for this you do get a good value.  Recommended for anyone wanting an easy, &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; step in taking care of one&#x27;s face.</li>
    <li> As a 28 year old man, I highly recommend this to others who want an extra level of clean for their face after a shower.</li>
    <li> I read an article on Yahoo about the best facial peels for under $20 and this one ranked well. Of course I had to try it. At that time I was able to get a sample of it at Walmart and loved the product immediately. I get the deep under the skin cyst type pimples and after at least two applications they come much closer to the surface. I was certainly happy to find this in a full size container online since it&#x27;s not carried here in a full size in my area.</li>
    <li> To say that I am satisfied with this product would be a lie..I am HIGHLY satisfied!! I have combination skin with random dry patches, and acne-prone cheeks and let me just say..not only does this stuff smell good, but it feels GREAT on your skin. I can actually feel my pores cleaning out while I have this mask on, and it&#x27;s so rejuvenating. Once you wash the mask off, your skin becomes brighter, dead skin is removed, and your entire face just looks so much more lifted than it was before. If you are wondering if this will irritate your skin..my answer is most likely &amp;#34;No, it won&#x27;t.&amp;#34; I have extremely sensitive skin, so if this was safe for me, I highly recommend it for anyone with acne-prone skin.</li>
    <li> after using it your face is a little less flaky but if you are looking for a heavy peel for acne scars or bad dryness it doesn&#x27;t really help.  I got it for both and I was dissapointend in that way.</li>
    <li> I like this mask, but it&#x27;s not my favorite.  It smells awesome - very sweet and tropical.  But, it doesn&#x27;t have enough &amp;#34;ooph&amp;#34; in the scrub for my preference and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling deeply cleaned.  I don&#x27;t really notice much of an effect from the &amp;#34;enzymes&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I had it in my head that this mask would be a thick paste like a normal green or white mask. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s clear with little exfoliating crystals. Feels and smells really good but not what I was expecting</li>
    <li> When I originally ordered this, I was looking to replace a small jar of enzyme mask I begged my technician for after I got an expensive facial at a resort spa. I have to say, this is just as effective. It exfoliates and brightens the skin. I leave it on for as long as 20 minutes, but I have very tough skin.</li>
    <li> This mask smells divine and it leaves your skin feeling smooth and clean. I don&#x27;t know about any other effects since I only used it twice, but it is so gentle that I don&#x27;t think it can possibly make anyone&#x27;s skin break out. I can&#x27;t wait to use it again, the smell is so relaxing and soothing!</li>
    <li> This came up as a search result, when I was looking for a peel-off facial mask. I should have read more carefully. I doubt I will end up using this product. It is sticky and goes on like gritty jelly.</li>
    <li> Love this mask.  This Freeman mask has a wonderful smell and is very firming to the face and neck area.</li>
    <li> I bought this after I saw in on Dr. Oz. I know, I know, not everything he puts out there is top notch but this really lives up to my expectations. My face feels so fresh and so clean. My skin actually looks like I have makeup on so I wear much less the next day. I only use it once or twice a week to freshen up and I am very pleased. It smells nice, exfoliates well and washes off easy. It is not greasy or harsh but gentle and I will be buying this as long as my results are the same. Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the rave reviews and because I absolutely love Freeman&#x27;s Avocado/Oatmeal mask (seriously, it&#x27;s great!). In true Freeman fashion this mask smells AMAZING. It smells like fresh pineapples and I seriously considered keeping this around just because it smelled so good. Alas, however, it really wasn&#x27;t that great of an exfoliator for me. I have acne prone, combination/oily skin and I need to exfoliate at least once a week or my skin gets congested. I was looking for something a little less harsh to use in the summer, but unfortunately this was borderline ineffective for me. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3-4 weeks and it hasn&#x27;t really done anything for my skin. In fact, I used a more powerful exfoliator right after this and found that this didn&#x27;t really slough off any dead skin. The only thing I noticed it did was leave my skin a tad more moisturized and \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; after which is nice, but I really need something that&#x27;s going to temper my problem skin and this is just too gentle. I also really need something that&#x27;s going to inject some life and \\&quot;glow\\&quot; back into my skin and, once again, this didn&#x27;t really deliver for me. Maybe for teens or people that have normal/good skin this would be great to have around, which is why I gave it 3 stars. It&#x27;s a good product, just way too gentle for someone like me unfortunately.</li>
    <li> i used and feel so good!!!!&lt;br /&gt;the smell is very wonderful and make my skin soft...this is my first freeman mask, i believe the mask will make me beautiful</li>
    <li> The product is great! I love Freeman masks, but it is way too pricey!&lt;br /&gt;I did not know I could purchase these at CVS or Walmart for $4 bucks only till last week!&lt;br /&gt;I just can&#x27;t believe they are being sold online for double the price.&lt;br /&gt;Not that worth it.</li>
    <li> Smells great and feels light and refreshing!  It is clear though, so do not be fooled when you put it on and do not see it turn colors as it dries.</li>
    <li> Freeman masks are the best. This is great feeling, tingles a little but really helps to exfoliate and smooth my skin. I love this mask. Doesn&#x27;t make me break out, doesn&#x27;t take out moisture, works well and feels great on my face.</li>
    <li> I used the similar Freeman product before, the only difference was that it was in 3-minute masks series. I always used it in the shower and it really refreshes and softens your skin. Great in winter time when the skin looks tired and dull. This version of the product just as good and quick application gives you the same benefits, even if you don&#x27;t do full 10 minutes. I love it and will order again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know ... it is a nice enough product.  I don&#x27;t know if it really does anything, but I use it from time to time in case it might make a difference.  And it certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt.  So ... I kindof don&#x27;t think it does a heck of a lot ... I had high hopes because of reviews I read.  But to tell the truth ... I don&#x27;t think it really does a heck of a lot.  But it makes you feel like it might.  Guess that counts!</li>
    <li> I AM A PROFESSIONAL ESTHETICIAN AND THE OTHER FRUIT ENZYME MASKS THAT I USE HAVE A TINGLE TO THEM WHICH MAKE ME FEEL LIKE THEY ARE LIVE &amp; ACTIVE THIS ONE DOES NOT HAVE A TINGLE SO I GUESS IT DOESN&#x27;T SEEM LIKE IT WORKS.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, works well.</li>
    <li> I am a beauty routine fanatic. I was previously using another pineapple enzyme mask and just couldn&#x27;t afford it this time. I have a new baby so I have to be cautious with money. I read the reviews on this and thought ok I will try it. First it smells yummy. Its a great pick me up in this cold weather. Also I was surprised to see that pineapple is one of the main ingredients. It goes on clear smells yummy...now does it work?? Yes it does.I had a beautiful glow to my skin after I used this mask. I love this mask. I will be purchasing this again. I cant believe the price!! What a great mask to use daily for me Lol. I know it says 2 to 3 times a week but my skin loves this. If you have sensitive skin dont do what I do. I do get a little red right after but it goes away then just tight glowing beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and washes off easily. It dosn&#x27;t have a impact on your skin like some of the other masks. Just smells nice and it it&#x27;s feels nice on your skin.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I was anxious to get this product. I use it as described and notice no visible difference. It has a pleasant enough scent but that&#x27;s not a good reason to take the time to smear it all over your face, wait for it to dry, and then wash it off. Just a waste of time really. Sorry, I will not buy again. Will keep looking for an effective mask product.</li>
    <li> I liked this mask; the exfoliating beads are small/fine and gentle. The scent is pleasant and definitely pineapple-y. The ingredients are also surprisingly nice compared to most products this cheap. It doesn&#x27;t sting like you might expect for something so acidic. It&#x27;s not a miracle product, but it leaves my skin soft and slightly moisturized.</li>
    <li> I bought this mask because of all the good reviews. I had hoped it would help with my dry skin a bit. Overall it isn&#x27;t a bad mask. It feels nice on my face and gives a refreshing feelings after i take it off. But it doesn&#x27;t make that much of a difference. People say its makes their fast all nice and glowing and dewy... it did not do that for me. I personally prefer the other one that i bought the superfruits peel off mask. But overall its not a bad product just don&#x27;t expect any miracle results.</li>
    <li> I bought this and thought I would try it, doesnt really have a scent to it and I didnt notice any change or effect  while or after I was using it. You can tell its there but thats about it, if you have super sensitive skin or just want to blow a few bucks then go for it. i wont be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I like this mask alot, but it takes much longer to dry than the bottle says it will.</li>
    <li> I had zero expectations when it came to this product even though I have always had good luck with Freeman products. All I can say is that this unique mask is awesome. It leaves your skin glowing and very soft. If you use it at night, the difference in your skin the next morning, is very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Add to that, Freeman does not test on animals or use any animal ingredients. Cruelty-Free and vegan.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin, if I use this once every other day it helps control the oil on my face. Also, it brightens my skin and makes it feel soft!</li>
    <li> I have tried this product a couple of times but after that, having not noticed any change in my skin over the course of a week (you&#x27;re supposed to use it a couple of times per week), I just put the tube in the hall cabinet and left it there. I suppose at some point I&#x27;ll try it again and then give up and throw it away.</li>
