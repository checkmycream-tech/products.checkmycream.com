      <li>I&#x27;m in the process of trying to find a good skincare line that is natural.  </li>
      <li>Ok, what did it do exactly?</li>

      <li>Nothing special, don&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
      <li>and counting)and makes my skin look better every time I use it - a reasonable cost per use (</li>
      <li>Such a lovely product, works just as described, most importantly though it really doesn&#x27;t irritate hyper-sensitive skin in the process which is rare.</li>
      <li>The cleanser dried my skin, the moisturizer left a greasy film (didn&#x27;t absorb) and surprisingly didn&#x27;t have a pleasant scent as described.</li>

      <li>This mask is definitely one of my top 10 cannot live without products.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>and you won&#x27;t need as much as you would with a creamy texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like this mask.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for me either way.</li>
      <li>I was absolutely amazed.  </li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read every word on the Tata Harper website and love everyting about their mission and approach to providing only natural products.</li>
      <li>And WOW, does that ever say something to me about the fact that they have something to hide!!!</li>
      <li>and it really did seem to breathe new life into my skin, with improved texture and circulation.</li>
      <li>Still waiting for the patches to heal and maybe there is a particular reaction to one of the ingredient?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Even when going the natural, pure and organic way, less is always more.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend</li>
      <li>Helps keep my skin soft and glowing!!</li>
      <li>It has a nice smell and the packaging is pretty, but it&#x27;s not effective enough for me to repurchase (it&#x27;s also really pricey).</li>
      <li>I had been a Sephora addict for the better part of the last decade, but over the past year I&#x27;ve been really trying completely switch over all of my makeup and skincare to scary-chemical free, natural &amp; organic options.  </li>
      <li>I tend to have pretty low expectations when it comes to skincare lines...</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s natural and it WORKS.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, but find this product non-irritating.  </li>
      <li>Then I looked into these ingredients in the Skin Deep cosmetic safety database, which shows that much of what we put on our skin is toxic.</li>
      <li>Excited to try her other products!!</li>
      <li>thinking about looking around and seeing if I am interested in any other products in this skin care line.</li>
      <li>So far this is the only one that I have come across (and I&#x27;ve tried dozens)</li>
      <li>So the logic goes why do we put something on our skin that actually kills skin cells, and then goes directly into your bloodstream, and eventually into the environment??</li>
      <li>On a good note, a little goes a long way, so even though the container is small, it&#x27;ll last you longer than you might think.</li>
      <li>I use it before I go out for a social event and always get compliments on my skin!</li>
      <li>Eminence Organics is what I am currently using and have never been disappointed with any of their products which says a lot about a product line and their samples are free :)</li>
      <li>It smells like fresh roses, it tightens as it dries on the skin and after washing off the skin is actually softer and yes, it does glow a little.  </li>
      <li>IMPORTANTLY to me, however, is the fact that I left a negative 1-star review on Tata Harper&#x27;s website regarding this product, and that review lasted about 20 seconds before it was taken off like it never existed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best mask ever!  I love that it is all natural - and so effective!!  So glad I found this product!</li>
    <li> I tend to have pretty low expectations when it comes to skincare lines...ever since I read a study that most of the chemicals used in them cause cell apoptosis (cell death) I don&#x27;t even bother with the heavily advertised products with \\&quot;proven clinical results\\&quot;. Then I looked into these ingredients in the Skin Deep cosmetic safety database, which shows that much of what we put on our skin is toxic. So the logic goes why do we put something on our skin that actually kills skin cells, and then goes directly into your bloodstream, and eventually into the environment?? It seems to me that cosmetics should be food grade in that case. My philosophy now is, feed the skin, LOVE the skin--seeing as it is a living organ, I seek out products that feel alive, with high vibrations. Tata&#x27;s products are unique in that they are handmade and have natural preservatives (as a formulator myself this is a major obstacle with all-natural products), with many ingredients grown right on her Vermont farm. So much love and energy comes through the product. The resurfacing mask smells gorgeous, I can&#x27;t stop sniffing it. Yes, I actually unscrew the lid just to take in the aroma. I&#x27;ve used it once and it really did seem to breathe new life into my skin, with improved texture and circulation. Excited to try her other products!!</li>
    <li> When I bought this, I used the one click setting through my phone which I normally do, and I didn&#x27;t read the description too much though unfortunately..... what I received was a TINY jar..... OVERPRICED in my opinion. I am giving it 4 stars however, because after I tried it it made my skin so soft and smooth and particularly BRIGHTER. It removes dull skin pretty well. I use it once a week and I really like it. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> I had heard a lot of great things about Tata Harper&#x27;s skincare line and was pleased that not only the product but that delivery was affordable and reliable.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see an expiration date on this mask but it&#x27;s been close to a year in purchase when I used the mask for 15min and thought some tingly affect... Major burns around my mouth and had some dry scaly patches after a day of branch of red small bumps. Still waiting for the patches to heal and maybe there is a particular reaction to one of the ingredient?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never experienced anything like this even after the worst of facials. I will stay away from this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I had been a Sephora addict for the better part of the last decade, but over the past year I&#x27;ve been really trying completely switch over all of my makeup and skincare to scary-chemical free, natural &amp; organic options.  I get most of my products (Dr Alkaitis, Kahina Giving Beauty, etc) from Spirit Beauty Lounge.  In one of my orders, I got a small sample of Tata Harper&#x27;s Resurfacing Mask so I gave it a shot.  I was absolutely amazed.  It smells wonderful, it&#x27;s natural and it WORKS.  I finally bought the full size (yes, it&#x27;s small and expensive - but totally worth it, IMO.  And this jar will last you about 3 months, using it twice each week.  Quite frankly, I&#x27;d rather pay $55 for this amount than pay less or the same for a larger amount of something loaded with chemicals and that doesn&#x27;t work as well.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just used it this morning, after several days without electricity because of a snow storm.  My skin has paid the price - it was just feeling dried out, clogged and not pretty.  After using this mask, it&#x27;s back to it&#x27;s normal self - smooth and clear and downright glowing.  You might experience some redness that goes away pretty quickly.  It also seems to help with fine lines.  This mask is definitely one of my top 10 cannot live without products.</li>
    <li> This mask is so wonderful, it cleans and refreshes your skin tone. I use it before I go out for a social event and always get compliments on my skin!</li>
    <li> I changed up a lot of skin care stuff at once but I believe I love this product and it makes my face so smooth!! Also use a tata harper face wash that I&#x27;m obsessed with</li>
    <li> This mask is amazing. Minimizes pores. Evens out skin tone. Has a pleasant fragrance and is so easy to use.</li>
    <li> Well, to tell you the truth, only reason I even heard about this product is because Jessica Alba recommended it for anti-aging. And you know that she has access to the best of the best! I managed to get the sample from Ebay and let me tell you, I love it. It immediately brightens  the face and once you wash it off skin feels very nice and soft. I&#x27;d say like a baby&#x27;s bum but I&#x27;ve never really touched a baby&#x27;s bum. I understand that the container is rather small for the price, but this mask don&#x27;t have your typical creamy texture, it&#x27;s rather runny and you won&#x27;t need as much as you would with a creamy texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking about looking around and seeing if I am interested in any other products in this skin care line.</li>
    <li> I really like this mask. I first got a sample of it from a store and I liked it so much that I bought it! It makes my skin feel so smooth afterwards, really great!</li>
    <li> Nothing special, don&#x27;t expect a miracle. It goes on, it comes off. Ok, what did it do exactly? I can&#x27;t say.</li>
    <li> Very gentle and pleasant smelling and leaves skin soft and fragrant.</li>
    <li> I love this mask, it does its job and it smells heavenly. i use it once a week and it hydrates my face. love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a face/skincare product that actually will have a noticeable effect.  So far this is the only one that I have come across (and I&#x27;ve tried dozens) that actually makes a difference.  It smells like fresh roses, it tightens as it dries on the skin and after washing off the skin is actually softer and yes, it does glow a little.  I&#x27;ve never had that happen before!  I&#x27;m in the process of trying to find a good skincare line that is natural.  I&#x27;ve read every word on the Tata Harper website and love everyting about their mission and approach to providing only natural products. After trying this mask I&#x27;m now going to have to suck up the cost and buy her $$ moisturizers.  If her face cream is as good as this mask I may have found my new skincare line.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Feels so refreshing.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders for dull, annoyed skin.  I have sensitive skin, but find this product non-irritating.  I like and have used the entire Tata Harper line, but just could not bring myself to pay $150 for the moisturizer etc. However, this product last a long time (6 months and counting)and makes my skin look better every time I use it - a reasonable cost per use (or so I rationalized).  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay, honestly. It didn&#x27;t do much for me either way. It has a nice smell and the packaging is pretty, but it&#x27;s not effective enough for me to repurchase (it&#x27;s also really pricey). On a good note, a little goes a long way, so even though the container is small, it&#x27;ll last you longer than you might think.</li>
    <li> Such a lovely product, works just as described, most importantly though it really doesn&#x27;t irritate hyper-sensitive skin in the process which is rare.</li>
    <li> I love this mask I can feel it tightening as it works. It makes my skin glow. I highly recommend</li>
    <li> This was absolutely a worthless &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; for me...it did nothing at all except tighten my skin while it was on, and then it just rinses off, not leaving anything changed as a result of using it. It is overpriced, it under-delivers, and believe me it will do nothing for your pores and skin texture as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MOST IMPORTANTLY to me, however, is the fact that I left a negative 1-star review on Tata Harper&#x27;s website regarding this product, and that review lasted about 20 seconds before it was taken off like it never existed. SO BEWARE.  ALL those positive reviews are there on her site bc they remove anything negative!! And WOW, does that ever say something to me about the fact that they have something to hide!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I have sensitive skin and this has been great for me. I see a difference in my skin it&#x27;s more even and radiant. Great product!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing! This stuff is truly a game changer. I can immediately tell a difference in my skin after using it once a week. It&#x27;s expensive but really worth it and it will last you a long time!</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed in this so-called &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; line of skin care products. Regretfully I bought into the hype and shelled out a lot of money for products that were obviously full of waxes and other ingredients that, although could fall into the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; category, are not necessarily good for us. Oh, and the smell! Unbearably suspicious... These products are SUPER expensive for what they offer. Just do yourself a favor and invest in products that do not contain 19 ingredients. Even when going the natural, pure and organic way, less is always more.</li>
    <li> A Huge Disappointment !!! I wanted to try this product after seeing it on a tv show. The only way you can is by spending $16 on a &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; packet. $11 for samples and $5 s/h. I wouldn&#x27;t mind spending the money, but these samples literally had one use in each. One sample in a glass spritzer bottle was busted in shipping &amp; leaked all over other products. The cleanser dried my skin, the moisturizer left a greasy film (didn&#x27;t absorb) and surprisingly didn&#x27;t have a pleasant scent as described. I emailed the company about the damaged product and asked for a replacement, but there was no response. I always like to try different products. I love aromatherapy and was not at all impressed. Eminence Organics is what I am currently using and have never been disappointed with any of their products which says a lot about a product line and their samples are free :)</li>
    <li> One of my favorite beauty products/ use it once a week. Helps keep my skin soft and glowing!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
