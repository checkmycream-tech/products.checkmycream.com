<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My hair is naturally very straight being I can&#x27;t do much with it including curl it :( the curls just never last, but this curling iron is AMAZING. It was entirely easy to use, very light, long extension cord...seriously no complaints! I highly highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Best curler &amp; best price! You do need to learn how to use it, as it is very different from a regular curling iron.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t care about the varying heat sections so I have no real opinion on that, although when I have tried it, I didn&#x27;t see much difference. Usually I just keep all setting on hot.  I purchased this product because of the direction you can roll your hair and the little clip to hold the end.  Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I like it. It heats quickly. I especially like the ability to lessen the heat on my ends</li>
    <li> this is by far the best curling iron i ever used. i bought a total of 5 for me and my friends. it is amazing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of curling my hair, it feels too cheerleader to have curls, but now and again I&#x27;ll have a special event to curl my hair for and I do like the loose waves that all the stars are wearing right now. I bought this because it said I could do different style curls and one of these was definetly cheaper than multiple curling irons. Believe it or not it actually works! It gets plenty hot and doesn&#x27;t fry my ends and I can do tight curls or loose waves depending on my mood that day or the event. Great investment!</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron!  It makes my hair so soft and the curls are so bouncy and hold really well.  My hair is long but thin and it really helps to give my hair volume.  The curls have a natural beachy look and it doesn&#x27;t take much time.  At first I thought it was a bit heavy but I&#x27;ve adjusted to the weight of it and I don&#x27;t notice it any longer.  It is also a little strange that the clip that holds the section of hair to the barrel is very short, but I think that&#x27;s a feature designed to minimize damage to the hair.  My main criticism of this item is the placement of the stand.  I have to flip it up each time I curl a section and then back down again when I put the curler down.  Again, I have gotten used to that.  I don&#x27;t know if the different temperature zones are a necessary feature or not as I frequently just use all three set to \\&quot;low\\&quot;, but I can honestly say that I&#x27;ve never used a curling iron that makes my hair so smooth and soft before.  If you want volume and trendy but classic curls that look soft and healthy, buy this curler!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing tool!Love how you can adjust the temperature on each ring so you can keep your ends from burning and splitting.I would recommend it no anyone!I was looking for curling iron for almost a month going through all the reviews for everything.This one checks every box!</li>
    <li> I opened and plugged in my curling iron as soon as it arrived.  I set it for glamorous waves and it worked perfectly! You do have to take fairly small sections at a time and be careful because the iron does get quite hot.  Overall, I can already tell this iron is going to be fabulous for curls and waves in my stick straight hair.</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron!</li>
    <li> So easy to use and made fabulous curls that lasted.  The different settings allowed me to add more curls infront and less in back</li>
    <li> Best curling iron ever.</li>
    <li> I love this product.It get the curling iron so easily, very effective to my hair. It curls well and stays until the next day. I love it. I will definitely recommennd it !</li>
    <li> This product has the small clip near handle and I found it awkard to use.  I am used to the full clip and not crazy about the small clip.  My hair is very thick and medium long.  It took a good while to do my hair.  The black tip is very hot and I got burned pretty bad a couple times.  When I would switch to the side that I used the tip on my other curling irons I would grab it before I thought.  Didn&#x27;t take but a second to remind me.  Definitely need a glove if you are used to working with both hands.  But if you don&#x27;t mind taking a long while to curl longer thicker hair then this will be ok.  I am keeping it however, and will give it a try again when I want curls.</li>
    <li> My friends and I all have one and are obsessed. Love the heat options. Hair always looks good and curls last for days</li>
    <li> I picked this curling iron up at Target on a whim, and I&#x27;m so glad that I did! The adjustable zones take the guesswork and labor out of curling my hair. I just set the temperatures depending on what kind of curl or wave that I want, and go to town. Yes, the clamp is small, but that is because it&#x27;s only supposed to secure your hair at the bottom, not clamp it down like an old-school iron. I get endless compliments on my hair when I use it, and will definitely replace if anything happens to it. So far I have had it for two years and it is still as fabulous as day one!</li>
    <li> This styler curls my hair FANTASTICALLY. I love that the different settings provide a different curl for each heat setting. This is THE BEST curling iron I have ever used. It is also good if you are just learning.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this curler because it heats up quickly. This might not be the best idea if you&#x27;re accident-prone though. I&#x27;ve burnt myself a couple of times. Yes, obviously it&#x27;s going to damage your hair if you HAVE to use it on HIGH. But honestly I never use mine on HIGH for all 3 knobs, only maybe 1 out of the 3, and the rest on LOW. I have semi-thick and coarse dark-brown hair. It makes me feel like I&#x27;m going to a wedding when I use it. Curls come out very romantic, and spiraled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a curling iron that&#x27;s sort-of like a curling wand, it does the job fine. You just have to open the short clamp, and wrap a few strands around the barrel before closing it. Overall, good product.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that will curl my hair and the curls actually stay. I&#x27;ve tried for the longest timeer to get those beachy waves I see in magazines. I&#x27;ve tried my flat iron, curling iron (all different barrel sizes) this is the only thing that I has helped me achieve the look. I love it. I find myself curling my hair all the time because they stay. Great product!</li>
    <li> This was recommended on \\&quot;The View.\\&quot; I noticed that there weren&#x27;t many reviews out there for this styler, but the price was reasonable, so I bought it. It heats up pretty fast and is hot-I actually burnt myself using it. I have shoulder length hair and found it difficult to use. The clamp at the end is very short and doesn&#x27;t hold your hair in place. I had a really hard time styling my right side, since I did not want to get burned again. I think this is better suited for long hair. Also, invest on the \\&quot;fire proof\\&quot; gloves. You&#x27;ll need them!!!</li>
    <li> I got this curling iron just recently for xmas. Greatest gift ever. My last curling iron broke &amp; i was on the search for something like this. Not too pricey &amp; so far ive just used it 2x, but it didnt disappoint. I recommend this for anyone who wants flawless curls. Easy to hold hair, easy to set up the different curl preferances &amp; heats up super fast. The thing that may be difficult is, in my opinion, the clamp to hold the end of your hair is only about an inch long. sometimes that is a problem for some. Love this &amp; once i wear this one out, I&#x27;ll def get this again!!!</li>
    <li> Simply the best for long lasting spiral or farrah curls &amp; beach waves...made well; excellent heat; fast &amp; easy to master</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, easy to perfect styling, every day I get perfect my hair done quickly without damaging my hair</li>
    <li> This is a great curling iron for adding spiral curls especially for long hair.  It has 3 separate heating zones on the shaft so you can make different shaped curls.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fun and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my new curling iron. I had used my friend&#x27;s prior to purchasing, and I love the way the curls turn out. They are much looser and more relaxed. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Garbage, the design is asinine, although it appears in the picture to have a clamp to hold down your hair by pressing down on the arm, the clamp only extends down the barrel less than 1/2 an inch. Hence you can only clamp down on the very tip of your strand of hair and I have burned my hands on every attempt to curl my hair.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this half priced! I have a pro beauty curler but my curls start to fall within the hour, but with this curler my curls last for 3 days!</li>
    <li> Great! Love it.  Easy to use and produces great curls!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Hollywood Styler for over 3 years. I have straight blonde hair.  I use it everyday. People ask me all the time how i get my hair to hold such beautiful curls and i tell them in short is a special curling iron but i do share the name and where it can be purchased as well. The small clip and adjustable heat settings for the sections of the barrel are what makes the Hollywood styler so unique. I will never go back to a regular curling iron nor use any other curling iron on my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best curling Iron I have ever used and I am heading on 40 now so I have more than a few curling irons under my belt, this one is so good I bought four to give to my best girlfriends and one to keep as back up for the one I use. The curl is amazing it stays and has those wonderful ringlets that you see on other girls but can never seem to master, A true must have for any girl who loves bouncy curls.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this curling iron.  I bought it on a whim and must say that I wouldn&#x27;t know what to do without it.  The curls stay in my hair all day long and they are nice springy curls, not tight and weird.  I have had at least 10 people ask me what I use to curl my hair.  You will not be disappointed if you buy this product.  Plus the price is right!</li>
    <li> best curling iron I have ever used.  In the past my hair never will hold a curl and this curling iron will keep my hair curled all day:)  Love it so much I&#x27;ve bought more of the same one!</li>
    <li> A hotel maid dropped and broke my styler just like this. It&#x27;s my favorite hair tool. I jumped on Amazon and had the exact same one in two days!</li>
    <li> What can I say, a girls best-friend.  Love it, simple to operate, does what it is suppose to do.  Some people do need technique to use a styler.  This one is pretty simple with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the temp on this one, and the way it curls the hair.  You want pretty curls or wave, without the frizz, buy this Styler, you will be glad you did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Seller, shipped fast, good price.  This one is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great, the curls last and it gets them done quickly. I have super thick hair that takes forever to get done, but this iron is awesome and does it&#x27;s job well.</li>
    <li> it works well, I&#x27;m not sure I have figured out which settings to use to get the look I want...</li>
    <li> I already have one of these, and let my friend borrow it. She loved it so much, I bought her one! Works great and curls hair quickly</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have purchased. I first saw it one The View as one of their &amp;#34;Must Have&amp;#34; items. The first one stopped working after almost 2 years of use. I have very fine hair and this does a great job curling it and giving it body. I will buy another once my new one stops working.  Love it!</li>
    <li> The first time i used it was when i borrowed my friend&#x27;s during a trip. i loved it instatntly!! its super easy to use, light, and i love the three separate heat sections! this is one of the best bargains you will ever snag... if you&#x27;re looking for a deal you MUST get this curling iron. i&#x27;ve seen it on other websites or in stores for up to $60!!! BUY BUY BUY! you won&#x27;t be dissapointed :)</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed this curling iron! It really works nicely and makes pretty curls. I cut my hair short so at the moment I cannot use it but when my hair grows back out I will be using it again. Just read the directions closely and follow I think you will be pleased!</li>
    <li> Worth every the money  Impressed the curls last for a very long time Better than any curler i used before.</li>
    <li> I love it! Had one before, it was exactly as I expected. High quality. It got here supper fast. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This curling iron changed my life. I never knew how to properly curl my own hair until my fiance bought me this curler. The clamp is smll enough to not leave clamp marks ad only grab onto the ends, the adjustable heating makes for easy customized curls, and the barrel is long enough for long hair or short. It gives pretty gorgeous curls, if I do say so myself. Although, since cutting my hair to shoulder length, it is  bit more difficult to use on such a large barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad mark I give this iron, is that it only lasted me about a year. :( The wiring is now loose inside the cord and unless I twist it around and mess about with it, it will not turn on or heat up. So, it&#x27;s time for me to find a new iron.</li>
    <li> I really liked this tool.  I have very thick hair and this curler does the trick.  Takes a while as I must curl my hair in very small sections, but the curl holds up well.  Would love it it if the barrel was bigger.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about the claims for this curling iron.  Due to the low price I thought I&#x27;d give it a try; what did I have to lose right.  Well I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. It works exactly as shown in the video. It&#x27;s really pretty easy to use as well, and I&#x27;m not burning myself like I have with other curling irons.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for my daughter and she loves it ! Great curling iron !! I recommend it all. Very easy to use</li>
    <li> If i would have known it had the clamp equivalent to T-Rex arms, I never would have bothered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses: heated up quickly and had a nice, long cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:  everything else.</li>
    <li> just as described ;-)</li>
    <li> Considering returning this, sadly! Given all the positive reviews, I was expecting to be blown away, but this curling iron doesn&#x27;t even work as well as the one I&#x27;d been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, very straight, thick, smooth (Asian) hair. I had been using a ceramic-coated Revlon curling iron for years (same price point), but the on/off buttons sank in and made it useless. That iron gave me nice, loose, natural curls that lasted about 4 hours when I had it on medium heat setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pro Beauty Tools iron gives curls that are too uniform-looking, like fake hair. When I finger-tease the curls out a little, they disappear!!! I have to keep it on high or medium to get any effect at all (and it feels hotter to the touch through my hair than the Revlon one). Even without touching, the curls disappear by themselves within an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another disadvantage: the clip is one of the reasons I purchased this instead of the highly-rated, pearl-pink, clipless Remington curling iron on Amazon. But the clip on this iron is too small to clip the entire curl onto the iron, instead of just your ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The variable heat setting is nice but I don&#x27;t find myself taking advantage of it much. I can&#x27;t believe that two curling irons that are mostly the same (ceramic-coated 1&amp;#34; barrel) could give such different results in the same hair.</li>
    <li> To heavy and very difficult to use!!  Wish I could send it back...but it&#x27;s to late.  My hair curls easily and this thing didn&#x27;t curl it.  Pros: long cord and heats fast. Cons: short little clip and extremely heavy</li>
    <li> I bought this based on a recommendation from my sister.  I was pleasantly surprised...it works great!  Quality product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I saw this on display at a Walgreen&#x27;s, however, non in stock, was told they were deciding not to carry.  THEIR mistake!  Amazon had it for about 10 bucks cheaper and it works great!  Love the short clip, (you don&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; the entire curl&amp;#34;), styles can be much more flexible because of the three zone temperature control.  I set low heat at the &amp;#34;ends&amp;#34; of my hair where I clip it, so my ends don&#x27;t fry with high heat, and use medium or high heat in the middle and at the end, depending on what style I want!  I would have paid twice what I paid for this, it&#x27;s really awesome, it&#x27;s versatile, and easy to use!  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
