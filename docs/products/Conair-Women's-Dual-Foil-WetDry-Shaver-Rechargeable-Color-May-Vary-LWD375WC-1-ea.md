<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have an older shaver also made by Conair and it had worn out--while looking for replacement parts I saw this on Amazon and bought it...It&#x27;s supposed to be good wet or dry.  I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower yet, but it gives a very close shave right AFTER a shower.  I love it!</li>
    <li> It is not gentle on my legs.</li>
    <li> Broke as soon as I took it out of the package</li>
    <li> the foil is too delicate and will bend or break easily, replacement is expensive considering the cost of this unit is not very high.</li>
    <li> Product replaced same unit.  It was less expensive to replace the whole unit. The replacement head was almost the same cost as the entire unit.  A great product for the cost.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried to remove the protective plastic head cover--the end tab at the top of the metal face of the shaver broke off so it does not stay on.&lt;br /&gt;I was not using excessive force.&lt;br /&gt;Plastic isn&#x27;t good for everything, is it?&lt;br /&gt;I was so disgusted I threw the whole thing away, I didn&#x27;t even want to bother to return it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grandaughter because she was just starting to shave and didn&#x27;t want to because of the razor.  When she tried this we didn&#x27;t have to tell her anymore.  She just loves it.</li>
    <li> While I like the shaving head, and the shape for holding,  but it requires constant cleaning and charging.  I tried having 3, hoping I was doing something wrong, but all wear out and no longer recharge after about 6 months. All done buying this product.  Why can&#x27;t someone make one that is both rechargeable and uses a battery so you can have power whenever and for as long as YOU want it?  I recognize Conair is not considered quality in any form, but still...this has been a total dissapointment.</li>
    <li> This shaver is pretty good for the price. I wish it got a little closer, but for the price, it works well. It is easy to charge and holds a charge pretty well. Is easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
    <li> Was a little hesitant buying an electric razor for that special area but I gave this razor a shot and it works AMAZING!! I seriously sweating at the thought of possibly cutting myself and it never happened. It gives it a very close shave but not completely smooth so you will still need to do a touch up with a regular razor.</li>
    <li> this product fit the bill nicely.  Easy to use, hold charge well, and price was good.Would recommend to any one looking for a good ladies razor.</li>
    <li> This is like a perfect gift....I bought it for my wife and when she use this....she just loved it. It goes smooth on your skin without any cuts or anything. She is enjoying this as one of her gifts.....</li>
    <li> does the trick, shaves bare as a baby, on my wife.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. Her existing razor quit after about twelve years. The price was great and as always, it arrived on time with no damage. It is better than the old one. The shave is sikly smooth, with no burns. It is also much quieter than the old one. Design is good, fits the hand well making it easy to trim even \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas.</li>
    <li> I had been using the same shaver for many years prior.  This Conair is WONDERFUL!!!!</li>
    <li> stopped working after six months - DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR QUALITY!!</li>
    <li> This shaver was inexpensive.  You get what you pay for.  The shaver is not smooth on the skin and doesn&#x27;t give a close shave.  I go over and over the same spots and the hair is still there.</li>
    <li> I just wanted something for a quick run over my legs when in a hurry. This does not give a close shave and feels rough. Pick something else.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for a couple years. I don&#x27;t use it as often as I should because I have a very hard time getting it to seat properly in the charger so that it will charge fully. Once it&#x27;s charged it works just fine.</li>
    <li> The price was reasonable, it works great giving me a clean shave; hardly even feel it when using it. Nice, smooth shaver. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> We bought this for our granddaughter who is just 11 years old.  It works fine for her but she has only used it twice in the last month as needed.</li>
    <li> I received this wet/dry shaver about a month ago and really like it. It seems sturdy and easy to use. I like the color. It comes with a little brush for cleaning that fits into a pocket behind the charger. Very good value for the money. I would definitely recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for our 11 year old daughter.  She does have sort of hairy legs, and all summer has been insisting that she be allowed to shave.  I don&#x27;t really want her using a razor blade, I don&#x27;t want her to cut herself and I also don&#x27;t want to give her an excuse to hog up more time in the bathroom - yikes.  It arrived yesterday, she fully charged it last night and has now shaved all 4 ladies in this house.  I gotta say it does a nice job even in the hand of a novice.</li>
    <li> There is really no electric razor that can compare to shaving, but this one way better than others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> I took my chances after some of these reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did. It could be a little scratchy like some people have said but does give a close shave. Just don&#x27;t push it into your leg, lightly and slowly go up your leg to maximize your results. I had a $40 one that didn&#x27;t work as well as this one. It charges fine too so far. One thing about it though, when I charged it the first time it wouldn&#x27;t start, I banged the bottom of it on my dresser and it started up, no problems since.</li>
    <li> works well and can rinse  blades off with water to clean. I have only used it dry.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a young lady. Thought it would be safer than a razor. She was very pleased. Came quickly.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for my Panasonic razor with floating heads which I bough in 2009.  As with all electric razors, you need to go over the hair a few times. This shaver doesn&#x27;t have the floating heads like the Panasonic, and it&#x27;s difficult to hold it at just the right angle so it shaves the hair close enough.  The floating heads really help when shaving around the knees.  The Conair holds its charge well enough to do both legs, but it never sounds like it is fully charged.  The Panasonic sounded very peppy when fully charged, and it was easy to tell when it needed recharging.  The light on the charger base is a bright blue and is irritating at night; I&#x27;ve had to turn it toward the wall so it doesn&#x27;t shine in my eyes while trying to sleep.  Even though I&#x27;ve only had this Conair shaver since Aug. of 2011, I&#x27;m already considering buying a better replacement that&#x27;s easier on the legs.</li>
    <li> my husband put this in my stocking for Christmas 5 years ago. I loved it then! Unfortunately I dropped it too many times and it finally broke. After trying a different brand that seemed to have all the bells and whistles I was disappointed. I stopped using it after two times. I was so excited to find this again on amazon! I give it four stars because you can nick yourself if your not careful, but overall it&#x27;s great. If I could go 4 1/2 stars I would!</li>
    <li> Best shaver ever!!!!  Love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter as her first shaver. So far we haven&#x27;t had any complaints.  The battery life is good but being a first time user my daughter doesn&#x27;t need to use it much.</li>
    <li> I have owned a shaver made by Conair for over 20 years and loved it. I finally broke the thing by dropping it on the bathroom floor accidentally, again.&lt;br /&gt;It had been a great shaver so, I purchased the same brand and am just as happy with this one. I would definitely recommend this shaver!!</li>
    <li> Back in 2006 I had one of this razors but in pink, after 3 years it broke when I moved to another location. Every other razor that I had never match this one. I came  across this product again here in amazon and I can&#x27;t explain how happy I am. This is a super great razor, super close shave. So far the best!</li>
    <li> For the price does a pretty good job for an electric shaver.  Not any louder than any others I have owned.  I do find it a bit irritating to the skin but then I have sensitive skin.  That being said it would not deter me at all to continue using.  Shaves closer than others I have owned.  Charge lasts a long time.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This razor is great. It is compact but strong enough to do the job. It is designed well. Holds a charge for a decent amount of time. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with the product, easy to use, and would recommend it to others. Despite negative reviews I am a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I just want to say this is the third one I have bought the first one I lost.  My second one my husband said he wanted to try it. He made one swipe on his face and said I want one. It shaved his face smooth one swipe so you guest it. This one is his. And they are a great company to deal with.  I will be telling others about this razor.</li>
    <li> It works pretty well. I was disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t come in the original box, since it&#x27;s a gift for my daughter. It came in a clear plastic bag.</li>
    <li> Works great. Should have bought this long ago!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this and I am so much happier with it then with the Panasonic pivoting head shaver that is so highly rated and everyone raves about.  I hated that Panasonic model I chucked it within days of trying it I found it useless and it&#x27;s made me never want to try their other one (even though it&#x27;s tempting they make so many).      I am so pleased with both Conair shavers.  This one I use on my legs primarily it works beautifully by electric shaver standards delivering a close shave with no irritation.  I can use it on my armpits without a problem but I don&#x27;t recommend it for the bikini area it gets a bit hot and the trimmers are too irritating there.  That said I am quite please although the one drawback is the construction is cheap and when opening the head to clean it the first time one of the cutting blades came flying out, it just popped right out of the socket and one of the tiny blades cracked.  So it is a bit delicate and the springs that hold the blades act as a launching pad so watch out for that!  That is my only complaint really plus it is not ideal for the bikini area otherwise enjoy for the legs and underarms.</li>
    <li> The razor is very easy to use and does a great job.  I am glad that I purchased it!</li>
    <li> I have been using electric shavers for over 10 years. This is my 4th shaver and the WORST shaver I have EVER used. If I wanted razor burn I would have used a normal razor blade. I have thick dark leg hair and using a normal shower razor KILLS my legs...it rips the hair out of my legs and leaves them bloody and in pain for days not to mention the razor burn. This razor isn&#x27;t much better than that. I have purchase Conair razors before and have not had this problem before. If you enjoy having to go over the same spot repeatedly just to get a semi-smooth shave and razor burn...then purchase this electric razor....otherwise you may want to keep shopping.</li>
    <li> This is my third one. I really like the portability and charger. The razor does the job</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter as her first razor. It works well for her and I don&#x27;t have to worry about her accidentally cutting herself.</li>
    <li> This piece of junk didn&#x27;t last 3 months. And I&#x27;m not a teenager that uses it everyday! What a waste of my money, it wont even charge anymore.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a great job on underarms, but is OK for legs.  It could be constructed much better than it is.</li>
    <li> One of the best purchases I have ever made. I highly recommend  this product.  Works like a charm. I love that it is rechargeable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of electric razors primarily to shave my bikini area. They always seemed to cut if I pressed even slightly down. This one, however, is the first one I have found to give me a close shave without cutting sensitive areas! Big plus! The charge seems to last a long time. My favorite electric razor!</li>
    <li> Does all the things it says ! The battery could last just a little longer , but it is still very good .</li>
    <li> It has been many a year since I purchased a women&#x27;s shaver. What a nice surprise to find how well and smoothly it works</li>
    <li> I always have to have an electrical shaver and this one is good. It is not that noisy and it shaves somewhat close and closer if you take time to do it. Can&#x27;t beat the price and the seller is good. Cleaning is good and it holds the charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> It may not pick up every little hair, but it works really well! you can see the hair it picks up, and I didn&#x27;t have to shave my legs for quite a while. You can get it wet and it wont break! When I got it, I started using it and it stopped working, but I didn&#x27;t know that it wasn&#x27;t charged so make sure you charge it before you use it. Other than that it works like a charm!</li>
    <li> It does the job after several swipes up your leg. But the teeth that I think are used for bikini areas does tend to scratch my leg and that doesn&#x27;t feel very nice.</li>
    <li> The design of the razor&#x27;s shape is ackward to shave with.  The design of this razor&#x27;s charging holder is not good either.  The razor is easily knocked off it&#x27;s base.  The razor is easy to clean.  I have used mine approximately one year.  I recently took off the top for cleaning and it fell apart and it cannot be put together again.  I have used it approx. 12-15 times.  It is out of warranty, so no replacement for me.  I will not buy this one again.</li>
    <li> I have used this only twice, but it seems to do a good job.</li>
    <li> This cuts my leg hair with satisfactory results in a pinch. Not as a close of a shave as my husbands expensive Braun.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife &amp; she loves it ! when she does her bikini area there is no pulling or pinching &amp; this sold her on this shaver the first time she used it.</li>
    <li> I bought this item and used it sporadically and it just died.  This brand new item did not last 6 months and I am not able to return it or exchange it.  It&#x27;s not necessarily expensive but I truly just wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 2 years and it works pretty good. It gets a pretty close shave and I like that I can use it dry or wet but for me it works better dry.</li>
    <li> Does well enough for the price. Keeps a good charge and glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> This is my second Conair Wet/Dry shaver that I have bought. The first one lasted about six years, then the battery finally died. I could not find this shaver in the stores, so I purchased a Remington wet/dry shaver at a big-box  store, and that is a piece of junk; it would not shave anything at all. With this shaver, it shaves the hair very easily and for me does not cause any irritation. The shaver stays charged long enough too. Now one thing to remember, an electric shaver will not get your as silky as a razor, but this does the job when I need a quick touch up.</li>
    <li> Works well. Although I am on Oxygen, For the short period of time it takes to shave my legs, it works just fine.</li>
    <li> This is a horrible razor.  I have used an electric razor for years and bought this one when I accidentally left my Remington razor at my hotel.  It was an inexpensive option and I guess I got what I paid for.  I couldn&#x27;t get rid of this razor fast enough after using it two times and feeling like my legs were scraped instead of shaved.  I recommend investing in a better quality razor.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut as close or smoothly as my old shaver.  Also it&#x27;s easy to  knock a cutter and springs out by mistake when trying to take off top to clean hair out.</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> works well when I use it.</li>
    <li> received it on time and is working well they say it works better with out shaving cream . just passing the word on from the ladies in my house.</li>
    <li> I had read the reviews on this and there were a few that didn&#x27;t like it, but I took a chance and ordered it.  I absolutely love it.  The shaver this replaced was over 10 years old.  I have no negatives to write about.  Very glad I purchased this.</li>
    <li> I had one of these and used it for several years.  When it wore out, I purchased another brand locally.  It was totally unusable, so I ordered this Conair shaver exactly like my first one because I love it.</li>
    <li> this is great i love it so much , if i had known it was gonna be like this i would have brought it sooner xoxo</li>
    <li> I wish I could do a 2.5 star. When this worked, I loved it. However, in less than 1 month of having it, and only using 2 or 3 times, it won&#x27;t charge fully. I&#x27;ve tried resetting it on the base several times and then took it apart to check everything was still in place. Nothing has worked. I&#x27;m going to have to trash it and get a new one now. It had so much potential..</li>
    <li> This is the second one I buy and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. The first one I bought lasted me 7 years and it still works, but I was ready for a new one, so when I saw this option on Amazon it was easy an choice.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Shave not close as traditional shaver, but I can use it while I am watching TV.  Will always have one of these now.</li>
    <li> This razor scrapes across my skin both before and after the screened blades because on each edge a raised metal comb like object is placed above the screens.  Look closely at the picture and you&#x27;ll see them.  I have scraped skin each time I use it because if I don&#x27;t press as hard it doesn&#x27;t work as well and when I press hard enough for a decent shave, well, ouch.  The hair tends to gather on the outside of the shaver and must be wiped off.  It is very difficult to seat it correctly in the charger and I wasn&#x27;t happy with the length of time the charge lasted.  I have only used it three or four times and am now searching for a decent, well made razor to replace it.</li>
    <li> ITEM DOES NOT CHARGE; constantly needs to be recharged.  WORTHLESS / USELESS 2-YR PRODUCT WARRANTY... Conair Customer Service: NON-RESPONSIVE  Purchased item 05-06-2014... VERY LIGHT USE... used less than 12 times since... CHEAP FOIL COVER EASILY BREAKS... SNAPS OFF... CHEAP PARTS!!!</li>
    <li> Product doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> does not stay charged very long and does not give a very close shave at all and actually foil head hurts the skin</li>
    <li> I purchased the Conair Satiny Smooth Ladies&#x27; Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver for my 12-year-old daughter. She wanted the blue-green color, but she got the purple and white color. It&#x27;s easy to hold and I like the charging base that has a little slot for the cleaning brush. After the first use (used it dry, not in the shower), I carefully pulled off the foil cover to brush out the blades. Two springs exploded out of the razor and the thin foil tore off of the razor on one side. It was unusable after that, so I returned it to Amazon. I should have heeded other&#x27;s reviews saying same and not purchased this razor. This product needs to be redesigned. It is far too fragile. I do not recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I rated it this way because within one month the shaver was broken.  I called the company and they keep saying on back order.  Once in November they stated that a shipment was coming in and give them 10 days to process the order and I would be receiving my razor before the end on December.  On the 30 or 31 I called wondering where my razor was and was told it is on Back order again.  As far as I am concerned they do not honor their warranties.  I wonder If you would help me get a new razor the same one or a different one all together.  Thank you for  your attention on this.</li>
    <li> I just bought a second one of these because I dropped the first and killed it.  I went to the store and found a Remington device with changeable heads--shaver, trimmer, etc.  I hated it; it made me bleed.  I&#x27;m returning that one promptly and loving having this one again.  I use it for a certain highly sensitive area and while it&#x27;s necessary to take caution with the trimmer edges, it typically does a thorough job without pain.  I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use a straight razor there without tons of razor burn and stinging for days; this lets me maintain the area nicely.    I use it dry and have never tried it wet.  I have used it for my legs before in a pinch but I normally like a closer shave for them.</li>
    <li> I was i little scared about buy this product but now that i have it, I think this is the best shop that I ever made!! my skin will never be the same again as the conventional razor,hurts me evey time i used it. I feel my skin smooth even if I use it with no water or shaver cream. I only used two times since I buy it but the difference is so clear. I strongly recomend this product.</li>
    <li> I wanted one that would not cut me.. That&#x27;s it... So this ones sitting In closet with half a dozen others</li>
    <li> Not working as well as it says only runs for 30minutes and has to charge for 16 hrs, what is wrong with this picture. It should shave closer as it says and doesn&#x27;t not really to happy but what to do.</li>
    <li> It worked alright but I prefer the shave I get from my razors. Be careful when removing the top pieces for cleaning, I wasn&#x27;t very careful and one of the springs shot off into a black hole or something, like seriously, I cannot find it. Might work wonders for someone else, just not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I liked this product at first, it worked well.  It shaves pretty close for electric and it never once pinched or scratched my skin.  But the battery life started to decrease after about two months.  It slowly started to hold less and less of a charge.  Eventually I was leaving it on the charger all the time and it wouldn&#x27;t even make it through one full shave.  This product lasted about 7 months for me before I had to replace it, which given the low price isn&#x27;t terrible.  But I wish I had just spent five to ten dollars more to get a product that would have been less of a hassle and lasted at least a year.</li>
    <li> I was only able to use this once before I had a bit of a difficulty with it.  After I used it the first time I was taking it apart to clean, as the instructions recommended, at the sink (because it says to rinse it off).  As I was taking the top apart to clean, one of the tiny springs shot out and went right down the drain.  So now I have to deal with the hassle of contacting CONAIR and getting replacement springs (Will update review with the results of that endeavor...).  It&#x27;s just frustrating because it is a brand new product.  In summary, be very careful of those little springs!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to the actual performance of the product, I was pleased with the results, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update... Grrrrr, CONAIR has been less than helpful in addressing the problem with this product.  They sent me replacement parts that did not include the springs, even though I specifically asked if what they were sending me would have the springs.  Now I&#x27;m just annoyed.  Wish I would have chosen another product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good bikini area shaver and even the expensive ones have left stubble and yanked hairs. This seems to be the best so far. Nice close shave. you have to be very very slow and careful though. You do not have to raise the trimmer if you are just doing a touch up to already shaved hair. If using the trimmer be sure to watch the angle because it can be sharp is angled improperly.</li>
    <li> Wife says she is very happy with this razor, Nuff said, Happy wife happy life.</li>
    <li> Excellent... Especially for young girls just starting to shave. Safe and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> Very good but a little too small</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t shave me like my husbands.</li>
    <li> I looked down to notice the top was very cheaply made and dented. I sent it back immediately. It sounds good; wet/dry. It looks good.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I need to look for another shaver through Amazon. I have had very good luck with Amazon products except for a few things.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with Amazon and their customer service. Amazon is a great place to do business with!</li>
    <li> This shaver works great!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with it!&lt;br /&gt;Normal razors would give me the worst allergies ever!&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.  It is rechargeable so no need for batteries.  It is wet and dry - so I dont have to worry about getting it wet.  It works just fine for all areas of the body.  (i didn&#x27;t have much luck with my eyebrows).  It has the little brush for easy cleaning.  Its great and I am glad I got it.</li>
    <li> This is a great little razor-it&#x27;s easy to hold,doesn&#x27;t take up much room,works great. I wanted to try an electric razor with hopes of switching from the disposable ones because they are so expensive and it&#x27;s hard to find the ones I needed at the stores in my area. Great product.I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase. This is my second time buying it. This shaver may not be the best out there, but I find that it works great for me. I feel like it makes my legs pretty smooth. And it&#x27;s so simple to charge that it&#x27;s no big deal to use it every day. Takes me a few minutes doing it dry. The price can&#x27;t be beat. The first one lasted about a year, and I have the second about 3/4 of a year. We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts. It&#x27;s still cheaper than buying a super expensive one which may last long and may not. If I have to buy one once a year it&#x27;s not too bad. I don&#x27;t like to spend money so for me this is great, because all the other shavers were too much for me.</li>
    <li> This is the only lady biz shaver that doesn&#x27;t cut me.  Love it.  The blades last for a good six months or longer.</li>
    <li> It is small and has a nice curved shape so it is extremely easy to hold onto and maneuver around curves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many shavers, including men&#x27;s shavers, with foil heads and the foils always get little cracks in them which make them useless because then they tear up my skin. Not this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives a nice clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen comments that it pinches skin. It just takes a little practice in how you hold it against your skin and maneuver it to avoid this. Make sure that the head is always flat against your skin. The edges are a bit rough and would scrape a bit if not held properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So no you cannot just whip it around without care, but given how nicely it is shaped it is easy to hold it flat against the skin and move it over your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also simple to clean and has a nice base with a rubber bottom so that it won&#x27;t slip around or tip and charges upright in a small but sturdy charger. That is a big plus. I hate electric things that need to be charged without a stand or with a stand that slips and slides or tips over easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is incredible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to provide one negative, it is that the plastic cap that fits over the head of the shaver tp protect it when not in use slips off pretty easily. I would prefer a nice hard snap on and off. So I use care to hold the cap on whenever I move it when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always found Conair products to be good quality and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Been buying this shaver for nearly a decade, it has been the same each time. For some reason I always end up breaking mine by accidentally dropping it on hard surface. Glad they haven&#x27;t changed the way they make it. The only thing they have changed is the color.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend.  She&#x27;s had it for a year and just told me again how much she likes it.</li>
    <li> This sucks. Plastic on foil broke first time used, purchased a replacement for high sum if $12 and same thing happened. DON&#x27;T purchase this item, you will be sorry you did.</li>
    <li> This shaver works okay. So far I have only tried it dry. I would not call it a \\&quot;satiny smooth\\&quot; shave. It did cut the hairs down, but I was left with stubble, even after multiple passes. Using it dry would be good for those days you just want a quick shave so you can wear shorts or a skirt out of the house since no one from a distance will know the difference. It will NOT be that satiny smooth, freshly shaven with a disposable razor out of the shower leg that your man loves. I&#x27;ll give it a try soon using it wet in the shower and then will update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the stand, it could be improved. The razor barely sits in the cradle. It doesn&#x27;t snap in at all so it balances precariously. If it isn&#x27;t placed in the cradle in an exact way, the contacts will not touch and the razor won&#x27;t be charging - which you can see when the green light is on. I couldn&#x27;t leave it plugged in and charging in the bathroom because it would surely get knocked down and probably end up broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update  11/20:&lt;br /&gt;So, I tried the shaver in the shower and that was a huge fail. It was really hard to tell where I had shaved as it didn&#x27;t seem to be cutting much of anything at all. I will never use it again in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I did give the razor another try dry. After experimenting, you can get a somewhat smooth shave if you go \\&quot;really\\&quot; slowly, going over the leg multiple times, to make sure it gets each and every hair. I&#x27;ll keep it around for when I have some extra time and I don&#x27;t feel like shaving with a disposable razor in the shower. The one nice thing about this razor is no razor burn (because it just doesn&#x27;t get as close as a disposable razor.) So it&#x27;s a trade off and earns that 3rd star for me.</li>
    <li> Bought for Girlfriend. She likes it. She is currently on Coumadin and needed something where she would not risk cutting herself. She is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> best shaver I&#x27;ve found for the price.</li>
    <li> THIS LITTLE LITE WEIGHT SHAVER IS VERY HANDY.  IT WORKS GREAT.  NEVER GET CAUGHT WITH STUBBLE AGAIN.  YOU CAN PICK IT UP AND TAKE IT WITH YOU.  IT DOES A GREAT JOB. IT IS EASY TO HOLD, AND OPERATE. I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Works very well when used in the shower with a shaving cream.  Gets a close shave.  Have not tried to use it dry.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t hold the charge good</li>
    <li> It stopped working a week later</li>
    <li> Perfect for safely removing hair. Lightweight and rechargeable. My only peeve is that it didn&#x27;t come with a cleaning brush. Other than that its quite useful and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> The package came early which is a plus, and it comes with a neat little brush.&lt;br /&gt;But if you are looking for a close shave don&#x27;t consider buying this product. You will have to go over areas several times( 4-5) I have not tried using it on wet only dry. Overall it&#x27;s not horrible but won&#x27;t give you a close shave, and you plan on returning you have to pay shipping and handling. Oh and the style of it is cute but performance is lacking .&lt;br /&gt;Spend an extra 20 dollars on a better shave hopefully it will be worth it.</li>
    <li> Works as well as any electric razor I&#x27;ve tried, but tends to lose its charge before I&#x27;m done with my legs.</li>
    <li> This scratched my legs. Returned item</li>
    <li> Love it, and it does a wonderful job, have also recommended it to both of my daughters. Never tried the wet part. Will someday!!</li>
    <li> plastic...all plastic, so of course it broke when taking off the guard to clean blades!</li>
    <li> I have a wide array of shavers and epillators and I have got to say that this little unit beats every single one of them hands down.  I get a really close full body shave in about 15 minutes.  I Love this shaver and am really glad I ordered a few replacement blades as I will be using this exclusively. This little unit is simply an excellent product and I find no fault(s) with it.</li>
    <li> Piece of crap. Fell apart after 2 uses. Buy the Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Shaver.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small, cute and I thougtht it would be fantastic... and then I used it. First, I dropped the protective cover goes over the head. It dropped onto the counter, cracked and shattered. No big deal- not that important. I used it to shave my arms, as a test run. Ran nice and smooth and I impressed. Then I tried to remove the foil guard to clean out the blade area.... and it broke! I wasn&#x27;t pulling overly hard, but the foil piece snapped in my fingers, springs and plastic bits flew everywhere, and the foil guards popped out. Grrrr. I had it out of the packaging for seriously 2 hours, and it&#x27;s already broken?? I&#x27;m a little upset. I think I can still use it- I shoved the foil back into place and it kinda fits, but still. Very cheap and flimsy. And I know I can order a new Foil replacement, but again- 2 hours after opening?? And I was only trying to clean it- not an uncommon request.... Proceed with caution. If you buy one, be VERY CAREFUL when removing the foil cover...</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to be a daily quick shave and ditch razors. It doesn&#x27;t even get used daily! I use it maybe every three days because the shave is close (for an electric) and as long as you lotion afterwards the skin feels smooth and fantastic until you have to use it again. I chose it because of other reviews and price. I would recommend it to friends and family. The only reason I did not give five stars is if there were two heads. The normal sized one and a smaller detail head to the shaver I would not need one for tiny touch- ups to other areas.</li>
    <li> The shaver was pretty good when I received it, but after less than 2 years, the battery stopped charging and it is basically not working anymore.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore.</li>
    <li> I M very satisfy with this product. Them been looking in the stores for it n could not find it. I just through out one I had for 15 years. I am glad that I looked on Amazon for it.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this shaver, but after six months, I am disappointed in the shave I get using it.  I generally use it in the shower, but also &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  wet dry, not too noisy, trimmers work well, charge last a long time&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  lots of stubble left on my legs, the trimmers scrapping along on your skin, they do not retract far enough.&lt;br /&gt;The results, I am looking for a new shaver.</li>
    <li> Great sound. Great battery life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fairly clumsy person so I&#x27;ve dropped this item once or twice after opening it up. Still, this doesn&#x27;t defend the fact that there is a flaw in designing this shaver, when it drops, everything comes loose.it has these small metal peices(I think 4 tiny springs are included; maybe 2)I&#x27;ve used this item twice and have already dented the metal bar and I&#x27;ve lost a spring or two. if you have small children and you can&#x27;t find these small pieces, doesnt mean that your children won&#x27;t find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick leg hair and not the greatest lighting in my bathroom so when I shave I uses my sense of touch to remove hair and I&#x27;ll litterally shave over the same spot 3 or 4 times and even that repetitive motion does nothing! I&#x27;ll still have left over prickly&#x27;s. I&#x27;m not sure what type of person (ethnic background or hair type) this product was inted for but I cannot use it to shave leg or pubic hair because it does a subpar job so this inexpensive shaver has primarily become my armpit shaver. That&#x27;s the only area I get a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;This could be because of the dents &amp; missing springs but I feel as though those pieces shouldn&#x27;t have disabled so easily in the first place.. I will say this......It does have a cute/cool little rechargeable stand Thats&#x27;s my only highlight! &amp; the color,gotta love purple!</li>
    <li> For the price this razor delivers.  Small size fits even the most petite ladies hand and the charge holds well.</li>
    <li> I thought this would save my daughter some time and razers but it failed.  She was rubbing this shaver up and down her legs and in tight circles then just gave up.  Doesnt seem to work much and takes twice as long.  Disapointed.  Not the seller but the product.</li>
    <li> I loved the razor but after only 2 months the plastic housing holding the mesh screen on, broke. It wasn&#x27;t very expensive bit I thought it would have held up a lot longer than it did.</li>
    <li> The on/off switch fell off upon second use. This item does not even work now. What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> The first couple times I used this, it cut up my legs...this is probably the 5th time I used it and it just broke on me, and pieces went everywhere. Maybe this is why it is so cheap.</li>
    <li> I bought this quite a while ago but am just reviewing it now. Still works. :)  Good product.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these about a year ago. Its been dropped and has lost some power. So because I loved my first one so much I decided to replace it. This shaver is the best rechargable shaver made for women that I have ever used. I mostly use it dry for my bikini. It was hard to find a great bikini shaver that is gentle yet powerful enough. This one sure does the trick. The unique shape makes it easier to maneuver in hard to reach places. Best of all it doesnt snag hairs or cut skin. I highly recommend this product to any woman looking for a smooth close shave. It is especially great that you can use it wet or dry, with or without shaving cream. (Product does not work with shaving GELS)</li>
    <li> This Conair is so smooth on dry skin.  I use it all of the time</li>
    <li> I used this item 3 times - it now sits on a shelf as a reminder that you get what you pay for.  It won&#x27;t charge - which means it won&#x27;t work.  Did a nice job the couple of times it worked - but now - not so much.  Every time I shave the &#x27;old fashion&#x27; way - shaving cream and a safey razor - I think about the paperwieght that SHOULD be shaving my legs.  Oh, and the reason it wasn&#x27;t returned?  It DIED three weeks after the deadline for returning.</li>
    <li> From reading other reviews I was expecting better. Not overally excited about it. Have to keep going over the same spot to remove hair.</li>
    <li> Why do electric razors never really work.</li>
    <li> Much better than a battery operated shaver.  Does a nice job quickly.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend totes works great</li>
    <li> This razor worked well for the first few times - it never seemed to do as good of a job as a regular razor, but having never used an electric one before, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  Now it won&#x27;t hold a charge very long.  Also, I took the top off to clean it and the clip broke so now the foil won&#x27;t stay on the razor, rendering it useless.</li>
    <li> I do like it but its not great, good item for the money. I&#x27;d like it to be a little sharper</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. Works great dry or in shower. I&#x27;ve had it a couple months now, and it&#x27;s still working perfectly.</li>
    <li> Works great, shaves pretty close, charges fast and cleans well. I love the pop-up shaver, especially for the bikini area.</li>
    <li> Great product, it met everyone of my expectations. I was having trouble shaving due to a torn rotator cuff and torn muscle and it definitely did the job I expected.</li>
    <li> this is the second one I have owned.It is cheaper to buy new ones than to buy replacement parts. they last about a year before they get dull and the battery wears out</li>
    <li> I was looking for a rechargeable electric shaver that worked better than the cheap drugstore versions I usually bought. This is exactly what I wanted in giving a better cut and being rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Blade is sharp and works great, but make sure to replace it regularly as it does reduce the shaving quality by a lot.&lt;br /&gt;2. I like the curved handle as it makes it easier to shave parts of my leg and does not impair how I shave at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. More razor burn&lt;br /&gt;2. Takes a very long time to charge from low battery to full battery (at least 6-8 hrs).</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for a couple weeks... it replaced another shaver. I cant even shave half of my leg before the battery dies.It takes me 2 days to shave both legs... and I&#x27;m not that long legged!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed did not work very well</li>
    <li> The full charge only lasts 15 minutes or so. It also does give a close shave . Wish I could have returned it. I guess you get what you may for</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get down to the skin quite like I expected. I own other wet/dry shavers and feel that they did a better job than this one.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  This is second one we&#x27;ve purchased, the first lasted my wife over 10 years and worked well all of that time.  Vendor is great as well and delivery was on time.</li>
    <li> It feels great and I have missed my electric shaver.  I don&#x27;t need it very often, but works really great when I do.</li>
    <li> I had to throw this out because it did not charge after the first week.  I kept plugging it in, but there was a short and the light did not go on to indicate it was charging.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this item to replace one just like it.&lt;br /&gt;I had had the original razor for at least 8 years and had replaced the blades once.&lt;br /&gt;When the original stopped holding it&#x27;s charge, I decided to stick with the Conair because the other had lasted so long.&lt;br /&gt;I hope the new is as good as the old.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint on the new one is that the guides/combs on the sides are pretty sharp and tough on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, I still had the old razor so I just switched out the heads and away I went.  (They are two different colors but not many people watch me shaving my legs, so it&#x27;s not a big deal compared to the comfort of the old head).</li>
    <li> The battery performance was worse than expected. It died and did not recharge after 3 months. As For the performance, i followed everything what the instructions said about not coming to conclusion just after one use. I tried different direction and angles etc. i had to repeat the strokes at least 3 to 4 times for an area to be clean but as a result felt a burning sensation. Thus this product left a horrible impression regarding shavers.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this, it worked fine but when I removed the outer cover to clean it one of 4  screws that raises the cutting heads fell out and went down the drain. I sent an email to Conair asking them to send me a spring, and recieved no response. The company is too big to care.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy!!!  Money well spent.</li>
    <li> This electric razor does a fairly good job shaving if you can get it to charge.  It sits in the base to charge but doesn&#x27;t seem to charge. I think this is a cheap made razor.</li>
    <li> easy to use and very quiet.  I have fragile skin and needed to switch to an electric shaver.  I ordered this one because of the description.  It is also very low priced.  Love the trimmers.</li>
    <li> Hope this one lasts longer than then the same brand and style I had before. Bought another one just like it because my husband likes it. May 3, 2015 This one just died also.  It is only a little over a year and half old.  The charging unit just quit.</li>
    <li> this one was cheaply made. I bought it to replace one that I had used for at least 20 years or more. The first time that I used this one and took the shield off to brush the hair out, the shield broke in my hand. It was more bother than it was worth during a very busy time to return it but it has soured me on this brand. Just beware.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes, but the first one I got from Amazon broke within the first month.&lt;br /&gt;Conair &amp;#34;took care of it&amp;#34; by replacing it with an entire second shaver, even though I just needed a little part.&lt;br /&gt;But, the replacement pulls my hairs out instead of cutting--like maybe it was reconditioned, or just doesn&#x27;t function well.&lt;br /&gt;Bummed.  But will find a different model when I shop again.</li>
    <li> didnt work as long as i read on the other reviews to i was disappointed.  it charged pretty well but kept stopping and not a smooth enough shave.</li>
    <li> First Impressions: Love that its fairly small, compact, and fits comfortably in my hand, I like that the foil/shaver isn&#x27;t menacing as well. The directions are very clear and easy to understand. I let it charge for 16hrs as directed and began on my legs, dry. After shaving my legs were smooth with little to no stubble. So far I am very pleased, will update with Underarms and Bikini Area, followed by another review after 3-6mos of use. Also if this helps I&#x27;m a 31yr old AA Woman, that became desperately tired of using and purchasing conventional razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underarms (Dry) - A bit awkward, not as easy a shave as with legs but after a couple of passes the hair was pretty much gone. You can feel the warmth given off by the shaver which is an uncomfortable sensation and prevented me from getting as close a shave as I had wanted. Will have to try Wet to see if that&#x27;s better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bikini Area (Dry) - Amazing! I was really shocked by how easy it was to &amp;#34;tackle the terrain.&amp;#34; If you haven&#x27;t tended the area in a while I suggest trimming the area down a bit before using the shaver or go really slow using controlled motions so you&#x27;re not pulling against the hairs. With that in mind i wish there were a comb as I&#x27;ve used bikini shavers with combs before and liked the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of now I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Always amazed at efficient and speedy service.  Great products so far.</li>
    <li> Poor quality. Every time I try yo use this razor it falls apart. The prongs on the side that hold the blades in keep popping out. Have to keep putting it back together each time and hold it together as I use it. I know that it won&#x27;t last long.  Very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin, this is a bad shaver.  No matter how softly I let it touch my skin it scratched my legs.  Edit: well now I realize that it really did remove any hair for all the scratches.  I will be returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the packaging, 1 star.  I have a cut on my finger because the clam-shell packaging, I almost broke my scissors trying to open it!</li>
    <li> This broke the first time I tried to clean it.  To fragile, althought it did the job of shaving. won&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
    <li> My niece is absolutely thrilled with this product and used it ASAP on Christmas morning . She is elated and says that it works great !</li>
    <li> OMG! It chewed my skin up. Those choppers on the edges are higher than the shaving part. Scratched my skin to heck. Guess I should have known at the cheap price. Read reviews and, dang, those people must not have skin. DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> I did not use it as soon as I got it because I wanted to use it when my skin is sensitive.  (I have actually caused a razor-associated  infection  before that my doctor thinks was caused by a combination of shave cream and scrape.)  It worked well, but when I went to clean it, the parts flew out all around the bathroom.  I did not find all the parts and suspect that one (a spring) went into the garbage can.  It was too late to return.  I shall contact the company to see if I can purchase the spring separately.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shaver.  Works very well for what I wanted.  The product also arrived EARLIER than promised!    Couldn&#x27;t be happier unless it were free!  LOL</li>
    <li> I am revising my review and rating it even lower; Amazon has sent me three of these because I keep returning them.  The lates unit does not charge fully, nor does it really hold a charge.  I am tired of returning the product; I just want Conair to design a better product, or get out of the shaver business and stick to blow dryers.  My earlier review: This was a disappointment, mainly because, although it cuts well, it is uncomfortable.  The edges of the sides scrape against skin and cause irritation; it is very oddly shaped and difficult to maneuver.  It  is still hard to adapt to, although I have given it some time for a learning curve.  And, for some reason, it starts slow then builds momentum; it is fully charged, so I don&#x27;t know why that is happening.  All in all, I would not recommend it, even at the extremely low price.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was tired of using disposable razors.  This trumps it all and is quick and easy to get the job done.</li>
    <li> I like the size , and being cordless is very helpful</li>
    <li> Happy with the result</li>
    <li> Works well. Better than my old razor. I like the size and I think the design is easier to hold for a person with arthritis.</li>
    <li> Even though I charge it for more than enough time. The battery life doesn&#x27;t even last long enough for me to use it. Maybe I got a lemon. I was and am highly disappointed and mad I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> This razor is alright. It holds charge well and everything like that, but it does not get a close shave. Initially, I purchased this shaver to save time and it does not help me save time at all. If anything, it takes LONGER to shave with this as opposed to a non-electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a replacement. Love the Conair Satiny Smooth.</li>
    <li> This product totaly sucks. Do not waste youre money. My wife used it twice and then it broke. Very cheaply made. The little plastic clip that hold the screen on will not clip back into the slots. This is pure junk. and conaire should be ashamed to even try and sell this inferior product in the united states..</li>
    <li> Tab broke off the top immediately.  No lasting power.  It has to be recharged after every use.</li>
    <li> NIce shaver, replacing our old one. Good service, thanks.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and this seemed a good choice. I needed a razor mostly for legs. The other reviewers suggest a light touch and that is really true on underarms. Push too hard and you will have some scrapes! It works pretty well with no razor burn on legs, though, just what I needed. I like the choice of wet or dry and it holds a charge for a long time. It&#x27;s good to see extra heads available online too.</li>
    <li> There is nothing horribly wrong with this product but there is nothing right to it either. It may work somewhat sometimes if you spend a lot of time and effort. I got this to help with the bikini area but it is not ideal for that at all. I figured I could still at least use it for my legs since I didn&#x27;t have an electric razor. I have tried it a couple of times and it doesn&#x27;t work very well. My boyfriend has even tried to use it on his face and he said he has to press really hard for it to work at all and it&#x27;s just not comfortable. He suggests I return it which I probably will. I have already bought a remmington one like I use to have for the bikini area. My old one was awesome but it just finally wore down. I think I&#x27;ll be much happier with my replacement remmington.</li>
    <li> The razor worked good for a few days but after that it was down hill for there I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a friend recommended it to me. I got the product and charged it and when I used it the charge barely stayed. I recharged it and same thing. Now I have a dead product with 16 bucks down the drain ! WASTE OF MONEY !</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for about a year now. Just decided to throw it in the trash. Within a few uses, something came loose inside (I could hear the rattling). Could never keep a charge for very long - barely long enough for one leg. Also, not a close shave. This morning it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on for a few seconds, and it has been charging for 24 hours. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought because of reviews said it works not for me. It left a lot of hair behind. I had to by a razor to finish the job. Everyone is different.</li>
    <li> Works well for intimate areas that you need to trim.</li>
    <li> Ive had this several months now Works well. Good value. comfortable to hold as well</li>
    <li> This is a horrible product it lasted no time at all. After 3 months use the machine failed to keep charge even when left to charge over night. Very substandard product for an expensive price save your money.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use the Conair Satiny Smooth Ladie&#x27;s Wet/Dry rechargeable shaver a couple of times before I wrote my review.  Before I ordered it, I read a lot of these reviews, positive and negative.  I was reluctant to order because a couple of reviews said it was painful and nicked their skin.  I am COMPLETELY satisfied with the performance of this shaver.  I can get a shave as smooth as my old Venus razor if I take my time and use a GENTLE up and down motion with it.  It says in the instructions not to press too hard and as long as you don&#x27;t, you will not have a painful shave.  I did use it on my underarms and I won&#x27;t be doing that again.  It says it can be used on underarms, but it left me with irritated and raw skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a Panasonic electric razor in the past and it didn&#x27;t give as close a shave as this Conair.  I definitely recommend this shaver and as long as you read the usage instructions and follow them, you will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this shaver with the dry method.  I cannot comment on wet usage.  The main reason I switched to an electric shaver was because I was tired of struggling with shaving my legs in the shower with my Venus razor.  It was time consuming and made it impossible to take a \\&quot;quick\\&quot; shower.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife. She had one just like it before that had lasted for many years. Shipping was fast with no issues. I would recommend this to anyone looking for similar items.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for travel or anywhere. Holds a good charge and is not pricy!!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean and return to charger</li>
    <li> Very awkward shaver!  It also does not cut the hair as close as I like, leaving stubble that is about as long as if I used a razor the day before.  I like a VERY close shave, so I very seldom use this.  I have given up with the electric razors and with only having a shower in my new apartment instead of a bathtub, I&#x27;ve gone to just using Nair.</li>
    <li> I bought this after I stopped making my own sugar wax.  Just needed a break.  I didn&#x27;t want to buy disposable razors anymore, so this was a great option.  I use it dry, about once a week and it works great.  I charge it up the day before I need to use it and it works smoothly and comfortably.  The compact size is easy to store and it&#x27;s very quiet as well.</li>
    <li> Small, but gives a very nice close cut.</li>
    <li> works well.  has an odd &amp;#34;sting-y&amp;#34; kind of feel to it.  not seriously uncomfortable, just a little bit of a &amp;#34;jar&amp;#34; with each swipe of the razor.  doesn&#x27;t hold a charge worth a darn.  still, i&#x27;ll use it til it &amp;#34;dies&amp;#34; cuz it really does shave my legs just fine.</li>
    <li> Close shave, budget friendly, but lots of nicks! I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I&#x27;d imagine anyone that does will not be able to use this. Shaving my underarms always results in nicks and cuts. There are better options out there.</li>
    <li> It scratches the heck out of my skin!  I was trying to replace my old razor that will not keep a charge.  This was definitely a bad buy for me.  I do NOT recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> I really like that this is safe both in the shower and not. I have not had it long but the battery seems to be holding well.  My only downside is the two side trimmers that don&#x27;t appear to detach and if not careful can abrade skin if not angled correctly.  The plus on that is you don&#x27;t have to hunt down the trimmer attachment if you want to trim longer hair.</li>
    <li> This was just what I was looking for.  Easy to use; convenient...and a great way to stay &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; daily.  Good value.</li>
    <li> The Product works well, but battery life could be a little longer.  The purchase Price for the product was about right.</li>
    <li> It does not glides smooth over your skin, it pulls on your hair when shaving. The blades are already rusty.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for a couple of years. When I first got it, I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed, but was changing from a Panasonic Close Curves Wet/Dry, which has a more contoured head, so I figured it would take some getting used to. I&#x27;ve replaced the blades twice, so I&#x27;m certainly used to using it, but I still don&#x27;t love it. It doesn&#x27;t do well on my sensitive underarms, and I find I get more ingrown hairs around my knees than I did with the Panasonic, and it tends to pinch in the bikini area. I do like the fact that the replacement blade set isn&#x27;t as expensive as the unit (which is why I stopped using the Panasonic. In the case of that shaver, it would have been cheaper to buy a whole new unit than to replace the blades), and it works okay as long as you have a full charge and use it often enough, but skip a day, and you&#x27;re getting pinched while shaving and irritation after you&#x27;re through. The shave is pretty close for an electric razor, and I like the wet/dry option. I really wish it had a battery indicator, though you really need to have a fresh charge on it to get a decent shave. The charger isn&#x27;t a great design, but it does have the Panasonic beat. I&#x27;m just not overly impressed. Time to buy replacement blades again, so I&#x27;m shopping around for a new option, instead. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one as a first electric shaver, or for someone with sensitive skin. The Panasonic was a much better shaver despite the higher cost of replacement blades/foils.

    <li> After owning this razor for only a few months, it simply des not hold a charge long enough to shave both legs!  Plus, I don&#x27;t get as close of a shave as I would like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been so frustrated trying to keep a &#x27;trimmed bush&#x27;.  I&#x27;ve struggled with rashes and ingrown hairs and the expensive prices of waxes and sugars.  This is my first electric razor so I can&#x27;t compare it to others but I can say it is by far the best method for my grooming needs.  A smooth shave only lasts for a day but that&#x27;s okay with me.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for shaving legs, it doen&#x27;t get the smooth silky feeling a razor does.  It is great at doing armpits for when you put on a sleeveless shirt then realize you need to shave!</li>
    <li> This product did not work well at all, however the item came to me in good timing...will not buy an item like this online again...</li>
    <li> i got this to shave easy and it was worth the buy i use it every day it was worth the price as well.</li>
    <li> For the price it is OK, Doesn&#x27;t keep a charge is the drawback, one day I&#x27;ll get a razor that keeps a charge</li>
    <li> I like the Wet/Dry razor very much.  It does a smooth job and quickly and efficiently.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. Nothing out of the ordinary. A trusted brand and it does what it says it will do. Easy purchase.</li>
    <li> first battery shaver that &amp;#34;yanked&amp;#34; hair out of my delicate facial skin!  Left my face sore for days.  Have done so w/other shavers for years, and never had that experience before.  Will return to using my  2 older Remington shavers, which were much more expensive than this one.</li>
    <li> As always, Conair makes a great product.  It works great and is a beautiful color.  I highly recommend this shaver to all women.</li>
    <li> does not work, will not charge fully. had this model before and it worked really well? don&#x27;t understand why this one doesn&#x27;t?</li>
    <li> In less than a month it broke!  Have been using electric shavers since the 70&#x27;s &amp; this is the worst I have ever used!!  The shave wasn&#x27;t bad but the unit broke in less than a month!!!  Don&#x27;t even bother with this item!</li>
    <li> I like my shaver.  Have only used it dry, but will try it wet one of these days, see which it likes best.  One review I read, said it worked better in the shower.  I will see.  It does recharge nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debbie</li>
    <li> This was purchased for a young teen who is happy with its performance. It was a great deal. I would recommend it</li>
    <li> It did the job but leaves nicks and I have to do the same spot again and again and again.... in order to get a smooth shave.  I had a remington for 30 bucks but lost the charger.  I should have just bought another because this is terrible.</li>
    <li> Worked great first time but broke as soon as i tried cleaning it.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t to sure how this would work for me, I have a lot of health issues and can&#x27;t shave like I used to so I thought I would give this a try for the price it was worth checking out. I&#x27;m so happy that I did it works great and I love it! Just used it today for the first time and was amazed at how well it worked and it wasn&#x27;t to hard to hold onto. Just make sure that it&#x27;s charged up the first time you go to use it!</li>
    <li> Broke the first time it was used...</li>
    <li> i had to buy a new shaver when i arrived in the US cos mine (same one uk) doesn&#x27;t work outside the uk, i had used my old trimmer for about 5yrs. i bought the Remington Smooth &amp; Silky Rechargeable Wet/Dry Shaver. It cut me many times and is more a wet shaver than a dry one. And by that i mean you need the area to be wet AND soapy before you can shave smoothly. Then i saw this the other day and it is identical to my uk one (Essentials by BaByliss 8667BU) so i bought it. works like a dream! wet or dry (i prefer dry) can&#x27;t go wrong with this shaver! it is gentle and doesn&#x27;t nip you, the battery lasts quite long too.</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for, like with this razor. I&#x27;ve used it just a few times before it dawned on me that the roughness of the blades was leaving my skin irritated. On a doctor&#x27;s visit today I was told to stop using this razor because the leg irritation was caused by the razor.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it doesn&#x27;t seat well into the charger and is easily dislodged, and there is enough of a light coming from the LED charger light that you wouldn&#x27;t want it near your sleep area.</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for in this. the design is good in the hand and the shaver gives a decent shave.  It&#x27;s cheap and easy to use.  Bit too rough to use under&lt;br /&gt;the arms, but the battery charge lasts and recharges readily.  If you&#x27;re looking for value, you&#x27;ll be ok with this.  I cannot find the brand I always used in the past, my old shavers were much nicer.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver and I like it just fine.  Easy to hold, keeps charge a long time, can use wet or dry.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> While it does advertise itself as a wet shaver it definitely works much better dry even if you do have to make a few passes to get some of the more stubborn hairs. It&#x27;s not bad in between days I use a proper razor or if I&#x27;m in a hurry, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d rely on it solely. It is surprisingly easy to take apart for cleaning and put it all back together though so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver!  home Health Aides have to help me and it is VERY easy to use.  Smooth shave, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Personally I think this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used! Although I haven&#x27;t bought this from Amazon YET,I purchased mine at a store a while back! It is seriously amazing. I get those irritating razor bumps and razor burn when I shave with a regular razor(doesn&#x27;t matter what I do to prevent them,it still happens). I got this expecting the same razor bump result,just without having to take the time to get either in the shower or use the sink when I already took a shower, just to shave my legs. To my surprise,no razor bumps and no razor burn either. This got a super close shave and left my legs feeling super smooth and no irritation in sight. Some reviews say hair was left after using,but you have to remember some hair grows in a different direction and you have to shave against the grain with this to get best results. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR ARMPITS.I tried it once and,yeah it wasn&#x27;t good! Ever seen A Christmas Story when the kid is stuck with his arms up in the snow suit (that was me,minus the snow suit haha). I tried on the bikini area and it worked well,I&#x27;d much rather use a regular razor for that (no razor bumps or burn there when I use manual razors). It holds a charge for a good half hour to an hour(at least mine did),but once you start hearing the vibration noise start to slow,STOP shaving and charge it because it will start pulling hair and that hurts. Rather that that this is seriously a great razor for a great deal! The only reason I am buying another one off of Amazon is because I lost my charger in a move and I can&#x27;t find it in any stores around me. (Plus its cheaper on here than it is in stores as well!)</li>
    <li> This broke shortly after purchase. I was a little sad I didn&#x27;t get full use</li>
    <li> Pretty bad shaver. I think I was able to use it 2 times before it started pulling my hair and dying after being used for about 30 seconds. I did store it on the charger so it would be fully charged, but it was pretty much a hunk of junk from the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> Bought Sep 25, 2014, today (Dec 3,2014) will not charge.</li>
    <li> I bought this as the first shaver for my daughter.  She really likes it.  It is easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> One drop and it broke.still works but crooked.</li>
    <li> I would absolutely not buy this razor again. After about 6 months, it got so that the battery was very run down. I would charge it and then it would only last about 5 minutes. The next day when I went back to use it again, the charge was dead. Also it had trouble cutting thick hair and would pull at hair--very painful! The charging cord is so long that it wasn&#x27;t practical to keep it out on my counter always charged too. The plastic has chipped and metal bent. I would never buy again.</li>
    <li> Who gets this excited over a shaver... Me!!  So happy money very well spent! Also what made it even  better! Two year warranty!!!!!!! 😀😀😀😀😀😀</li>
    <li> This item worked fine until I went to lift the top piece to use the little brush. The plastic is so thin and fragile, it broke and now the thing is useless.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, but feels kind of cheap. It takes a long time going over one spot to finally get a &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; finish. I had a Remington previously that did a much better job in a faster amount of time. I didn&#x27;t even finish shaving and the batter died on this one...&lt;br /&gt;And it constantly feels like it&#x27;s scraping across the skin. I&#x27;m sure that wouldn&#x27;t happen if I wasn&#x27;t pressing hard, but if you don&#x27;t press hard, you won&#x27;t get a very smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s okay. I definitely wish there was a better option though.</li>
    <li> Wish I would not have tried to save money by buying this product. Pulls hair, does not give a close shave and the head is actually rough on skin.</li>
    <li> This thing is junk.  Does not shave arm pits at all, all other areas were left stubbly, not smooth.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> My daughter had a previous model of this razor but dropped &amp; broke it.  I am so glad I found this one.  It&#x27;s even better than what she had!!  She even loves the color. Yall were so great to send it so promptly during the holiday season too!!</li>
    <li> This product is great for hair removal in very sensitive areas.  Unless you change the blades every 1.5 you might have to buy a new one. However, for the price it works well and doesn&#x27;t give me ingrown hairs</li>
    <li> loved my remington but the battery quit holding its charge; when I bought this because price was better I was disappointed that no matter which angle I used to hold it against my skin the sides of the edge trimmers kept scratching my skin; returned it to amazon for my money back. Remington one had a depressible edge trimmer so I didn&#x27;t have any scratching</li>
    <li> Okay, Okay, I am not a fan of Conair products, I avoid them like the plague, I only bought this because all other shavers just don&#x27;t seem to have all the bells and whistles that I wanted. Conair products always are user friendly but always break within a month of using.&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;m aging my hair texture is just changing and razors were just not removing the hair in my girl parts. I never owned an electric shaver, always used disposable; but I had to get with the times. For at least 3 months I researched all of the items on Amazon reading the reviews and I simply bought this one for the price I was so on the fence.&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the package it is so pretty and elegant! I love the curved design and it works great. The power level is top notch, and it removes all hair. Like old school rechargeables, I wait until it has fully charged down before I set it to recharge.\]]] It does not nick or cut, I luv it so much I search for things to shave. This will go in the category of one of my best buys EH-Ver! Enjoy</li>
    <li> i love it..even i gave it to my sister inlaw as gift but she said that she love it so much..very easy to use</li>
    <li> I love this product. It was purchased at Aldi, they have them for $16.99 this week. What I quickly learned is that for it to work well you need to use it with soap or a shaving product. I just used body wash and shaved right over it in the shower and it works amazingly well. Very close shave. No more razors for me.</li>
    <li> It deos shave but wish I had paid attention to other reviews. It can really scratch your skin if you don&#x27;t hold it at a particular angle.</li>
    <li> does not shave as well as I thought it was or as closely</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge!</li>
    <li> While this shaver worked, it served my every shaving need - legs, armpits, bikini line. However, after a while it refused to run while dry. I would have to run it through a spritz of shower water to get it to run fast enough so that it wouldn&#x27;t pull my hair, and I think that took a toll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did last a long time, though. After 3-4 years of use, it finally sputtered out and refused to charge. Curious, I took it apart and realized the section of the shaver that is meant to be water-proof had been corroded (I assume from contact with water). So it may not be as waterproof as I had thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final opinion: Hey, it saved me from having to deal with shaving cream and cuts from razors. It did its job and lasted longer than I expected, so I&#x27;m getting my second one hoping for another good deal.</li>
    <li> doesnt hold a charge well requires a lot of time to charge and you have to go extremely slow for it to be effective at all then the charge dies in between each leg and i have very small legs</li>
    <li> A good job finally I can decide between dry or wet shaving saves up my time kinda hard to remove the head to rise the hair out but nothing you can&#x27;t get use to</li>
    <li> Get shaver for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for many years and it&#x27;s no longer available at Target or Walgreens where I&#x27;ve bought at least two.  They last about two years and for $20 it&#x27;s a steel. Shaves great, no stubble or pain, recharges great for as long as I can keep it from falling apart from dropping it in the shower. It&#x27;s wet/dry so I use the wet feature and unfortunately it gets dropped a few times. Maybe I&#x27;ll wrap it in rubber bands to give it some shock protection while keeping it held together when I inevitably drop it. I&#x27;ve paid much more for inferior models.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to replace my previously beloved Conair electric razor after our new dog chewed it up/ I have found this one tends to pull out hairs on occasion, but I&#x27;m hoping that will end as it gets used more. As with my previous Conair razor, it cuts better when the hair is wet.</li>
    <li> Stopped holding a charge well after two months.</li>
    <li> This is a good electric shaver. Most electric shavers are not good at giving you a close shave. This one is as close to a good shaving experience as you will get.</li>
    <li> I love the shaver it exceeds any&lt;br /&gt;expectations that I had. and the fact that its rechargeable is wonderful. and I would buy it again</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold charge, doesn&#x27;t cut well.  Disappointed in the razor as a whole.  Stuffed it into a drawer after trying it for a month.</li>
    <li> I have thick ropey varicose veins and this shaver is just what I needed.  It arrived on  time and in good shape.  Happy New Year.</li>
    <li> Does not do anything it says it does. I used it once and was probably then worst shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Good for Bikini area. also good for legs anmd underarms/ Much easier to order on line than  to try to find at the store.</li>
    <li> The curved shaver helps with a closer shave. Still need to watch as you can nick yourself with this. Otherwise, it works gently if you do!</li>
    <li> This shaver was not good to me.  Did not seem like you had shaved at all.  Sent it back but hasn&#x27;t found anything I liked.</li>
    <li> SO LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom. She is on chemo and any nick or cut puts her at risk for infection so we got this little guy so she can have smooth legs for all the nursing staff that waits on her. She says it works well so I&#x27;ll have to take her word on it.</li>
    <li> After several Lady Remington wet/dry shavers and their high cost replacement screens/cutters and short life. I found this one on clearance where I worked a few years ago and thought why not. What a pleasant surprise! I use it daily in the shower with great results! I almost always use it wet with a light soaping and it glides smooth and shaves close with a quick pass. It has outlived all previous shavers I&#x27;ve owned and I haven&#x27;t had to replace the screen. I&#x27;ll be ordering a new one soon just to have on hand.</li>
    <li> I knew I was taking a chance when I purchased one of the less expensive options.  I&#x27;ve had it for less than a year, and it&#x27;s already not working.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with the razor the top broke and I am going to send it back to you.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t hold a charge well. even after letting it fully charge. only last about 5-10min. also does not give a close shave.</li>
    <li> This shave is ok. It&#x27;s too big to hold for certain areas. It gives a clean shave  once you get adjusted to using it.</li>
    <li> WIFE LOVES THE SHAVER</li>
    <li> Not that great. Buy okay for the price.</li>
    <li> Good product. Does what it is supposed to do very well. Couldn&#x27;t ask for much more. Happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Like it because it can be used with or without shave cream. One draw back is that most of the creams on the market are gels. They do not recommend using this with a get.</li>
    <li> Better than I had expected for the price.  I would recommend it to anyone who needs this type of shaver.</li>
    <li> This product is for people who obviously don&#x27;t mind devoting needless time repeating the same action that only need be repeated once. If I am shaving, I am not trying to go back constantly over something and recieve poor results. This product is a trimmer; very poor indeed.</li>
    <li> Not a close shave, not worth what I paid for it. Not really useful for my legs, because it will leave it stubbly. I like the trim section for my bikini area.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor purchase. I was a little nervous to use it having read some of the other reviews but decided I would take the time out to put the product to use. I just finished using it and it provides a great, close shave with no cuts or irritation! I didn&#x27;t do a dry shave because those always trouble my skin. I used shaving gel and didn&#x27;t rush while I was using the razor. I also held it vertical because I didn&#x27;t want the two razors that stick out a little to scrape my skin. I would recommend this product to others! I&#x27;m glad I did a little research before my purchase!</li>
    <li> Easily operable. I love the fact that I can use it wet or dry. My only problem is that I dropped it right after I got it and the one side of the lid broke where it holds it down and now it won&#x27;t stay on. That&#x27;s my own fault though.</li>
    <li> Its ok but i like the smaller one i got better,i  have not used this much because it kinda scratches my legs,not sure if i&#x27;m useing it right.It charges good.</li>
    <li> I like this razor because it has a small head.  Unfortunately, after less than a year of use, the battery will not hold a charge any more.</li>
    <li> I am left handed, so the left-curving design made for right handers is incredibly awkward. This is my second of this razor because the first one worked forever and worked MUCH BETTER than this replacement in different colors. I couldn&#x27;t find any others in this price range with the same minimal set of features I sought, so I got this one again. (There were several out there but their chargers plugged directly into an outlet which does NOT work for me.) The only other problem is that the base and item are so curvy that it&#x27;s hard to actually get the thing at the proper angle to get it to sit in the base! When will manufacturers learn that women don&#x27;t need everything to look curvy and gentle --- we just need it to WORK.</li>
    <li> I had to read several reviews before actually buying this shaver, and noticed that some of them said that It might hurt to shave with it in certain areas, but let me tell you, I does not hurt at all!&lt;br /&gt;I like it! It works great, didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it does not have enough potential even though it is an electric devise, it doesn&#x27;t have the power that other shavers have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it does the work. It shaves and it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> I ordered this razor and ended up returning it.  It is not comfortable and feels scratchy.  It is also noisy which is annoying.  The head does not pivot, and I think that makes a difference in the comfort when shaving.  I would never buy this model again.</li>
    <li> Not sure why the battery life span didn&#x27;t last as long as other shavers I have bought of this brand in the past. disappointed</li>
    <li> Worked well for the first 6 months, gradually loses power to shave close enough and now it&#x27;s a pain to use. Mine never lasted for 25 minutes even after more than 12 hours charging, it can only run for 10 minutes now after a full charge and the shave is not clean enough. So I can&#x27;t use this shaver anymore and looking for a different brand now.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly easy to use!  Since I am use to using a razor I still need to get a bit more practice with this unit, but so far I love it.  I am on oxygen so shaving my legs is a hassle, but with the Satiny Smooth by Conair Dual Foil Wet/Dry Razor it is much easier.</li>
    <li> This is a awesome shaver it works very well. I owned one years ago it lasted along time, didn&#x27;t know I could buy replaceable razor for it and got rid of it.</li>
    <li> Its allright, and it does the job. cordless and battery runs pretty long enough to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;shaved pretty good.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical of purchasing this shaver at first, but I was nicely surprised. It gives a pretty close shave and I like that it can also be used wet.</li>
    <li> Arrived in time for Christmas, my granddaughter was very pleased.  A piece of the bladeholder broke almost immediately - when she first tried it.  But it seems to function without the missing piece.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my granddaughter when she started shaving so she wouldn&#x27;t scar her legs.  She didn&#x27;t like it so I tried it and it is just too much work.  Not a close shave, even after going over the same spot several times.</li>
    <li> Screen breaks easy if you are not careful, but other than that a good razor.</li>
    <li> I bought the Conair to replace a Remington that I had bought just a few months ago.  The Remington was not holding a charge for long and it was giving me a horrible skin burn under my arms every time I used it while at the same time it didn&#x27;t shave the hairs!  I thought I would try the Conair - the first three days I was pleased as could be.  It shaved closer than my Remington without scratching my underarms to death.  It did a nice job on my legs leaving so little hair that it was almsot as close as my regular Gillette razor.  But day three was the day that really upset me - while shaving my legs the little plastic pieces on the edges that hold the foils together broke.  The entire foil section fell into pieces in the tub.  I should think a razor that is meant for such a challenging task as shaving women&#x27;s legs should last longer than three days.  I am returning it to the store for my money back.  I am so disappointed because it was doing a much better and much less painful job than my Remington!! Sorry to say I am extremely disappointed in the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this in 2012 and it lasted until now and I was pleased with the performance so I repurchased it.  However, before I bought this again I tried Panasonic and a lesser priced Conair and they did not perform like my memory of this model so here&#x27;s hoping this works as good as the one I bought almost 3 years ago.</li>
    <li> The shaver worked well until I went to clean it.  When I removed the blade , to clean with the proved brush, the springs fell out and a small piece of plastic broke which held all in place. As a customer how do you with this- I am in Canada now.  Probably to expensive to return.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> THis is a great product at a very reasonable cost.  I am very happy I listened to other reviewers and selected this one.  The convenience it offers when having a small child and not being able to take those long enjoyable showers is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have found this to be my go to shaver. The fact that I can use this both wet or dry cuts shaving time in half. Most of the time I use this in the tub/shower and it can be used anywhere on the body. I like the results that I get in the end, if I don&#x27;t buy this again I will most certainly get something close and similar to it.</li>
    <li> I need a new electric razor.  I cannot use regular shaver due to psoriasis on legs.&lt;br /&gt;I had this same razor for many years and recently had to throw it out.  I was surprised to see the exact same one is still made. That speaks to the quality of this razor.</li>
    <li> as advertised--Well packaged --Very quick shipment! Thanks</li>
    <li> I find that it scratches my legs when I use it dry.</li>
    <li> This is the 7th one I have owned. Be fore warned, they last about six months, then the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge. While they are working propery they give a decent shave for an inexpensive razor. But when they start having battery problems they stop working very quickly..So be prepared.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting</li>
    <li> This shaver works great</li>
    <li> I use this shaver mainly to sit and dry shave my legs, so I don&#x27;t have to shave in the shower.  I feel it scratches my skin slightly so I have to shave very slowly and carefully.  It gave me a close shave and my skin was fine afterward.  I think that the shaver is convenient and acceptable for the price.</li>
    <li> I was questioning rather or not this would work well when I bought it, so after I got it I tested it out on my legs using nothing at all, just this shaver. It works great! Close shave, and safe to use! No cuts! :) Highly recommend this shaver!</li>
    <li> Keep in mind I&#x27;ve never used any electric shaver besides this one - but it works great. I would say replace it every 5-6 months because the blades get dull, but for the price, thats 40ish dollars you&#x27;re spending a year on shaving rather than the much large amount of money you&#x27;ll spend a year on disposable razors. Get this. The only thing is it can take a while to shave thoroughly. worth it though.</li>
    <li> I went out on a limb and bought this and totally regret it.&lt;br /&gt;The curved shape didn&#x27;t do anything for me - I didn&#x27;t hate it, but it wasn&#x27;t helpful or anything, so I could take it or leave it.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions which say to use this shaver exclusively for at least 12-14 shaves so your leg hair gets \\&quot;used\\&quot; to a different method of shaving.  Well, shave one: stubble.  Two and a half weeks and 15 shaves later - still get stubble.  I gave up and switched back to my old school razors - back to a quick, close! shave I can count on.&lt;br /&gt;The bikini trimmer worked fine, but this is not worth the money for the bikini trimmer alone.  I can get one of those for ten bucks at Target and it would have a skinnier width which would actually make the trimming easier.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this thing is poop.  If you really want an electric razor/shaver/trimmer - go with something besides this.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews on this shaver, I decided to buy it anyway.  After reading the reviews of other shavers, I settled on this one since no shaver was really inspiring.  I have to agree with some of the reviews.  The shaver does an adequate shaving job but iritates the skin.  Shaving is not a pleasant experience.  Therefore, I am still in the market - shopping for a better product.</li>
    <li> I havent used an electric razor since i tried my first one over 40 years ago. Anyway, my skin is extremely thin as i have aged and a razor with a blade tears my skin and then it bleeds and leaves scabs. Thought i would try the Conair because the other reviews sounded positive. I love this razor. I barely skimmed it over my skin so i could get used to it and i dont require a close shave. However, this was a fairly close shave. Left no burn or irritation and i used it dry. Im extremely pleased with this product and would recommend it unless you really want a perfect shave. It is slightly awkward when placing it in the charger but just remember to make sure the light indicator is on so you know it is charging.</li>
    <li> Light and easy to use.  Great gift.</li>
    <li> At first this shaver seemed to work okay. Only used on a weekly basis if that. After one month, the charge would not hold for even 3 mins. before rapidly discharging. By the time I returned from a vacation, I could no longer return it. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Item arrived timely. Was purchased as a gift. Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad. I can&#x27;t give an opinion of the lasting or quality feature.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for YEARS.  I have tried many different ones, and yet I always come back to this one.  This one gives the closest shave and never irritates my skin like most others do.  I will continue to buy these shavers.</li>
    <li> I bought and returned the first one I purchased, it was defective.  They were quick to send a new one and it seems to work great. Thanks for the great customer service.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great when it works, but that doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Most annoying product ever...goes dead as soon as you begin to use it even if fully charged</li>
    <li> This razor is useless. Doesn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and looks great. New in blister pack as found in the store but better price even with shipping added.</li>
    <li> Cheap shaver and does the job. Small and handy.</li>
    <li> This shaver works as expected. It&#x27;s great for a touch up before work. It doesn&#x27;t get a close as a razor shave, but it&#x27;s good. It feels like the evening after a razor shave... if that helps!</li>
    <li> Sent it back. It will work find for females in their early teens who are just starting to shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this a two star rating because it doesn&#x27;t work that great. I have to keep going over and over one spot on my legs to get it to be smooth. Otherwise the look of it is cool , but the preformance just isn&#x27;t there.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver ever</li>
    <li> When they described this razor as saying smooth, I have to admit I was skeptical. Once I tried it, I knew it was no lie! Easy to use wet or dry, and it does leave your skin feeling smooth no matter where you shave.</li>
    <li> Okay for the price, does not hold a charge long enough to shave both legs. Have to go very slow and go over the same spot numerous times.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for the price. Sometimes it will catch your skin, so it&#x27;s best to use plenty of shaving cream. I wouldn&#x27;t advise you dry shave.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair on my entire body so usually it takes a minute to shave especially my legs because I shave them so much but I was delighted to see that it didn&#x27;t take as long and the fact I can dry shave with it made everything easier.</li>
    <li> Original instructions said to charge for sixteen hours, and thereafter the shaver would continue to hold a thirty minute charge. Well, I used it a couple of times, worked just fine, got a close shave and everything. Discontinued using it for a couple of months, and when I finally decided I wanted to shave, it held a charge for approximately ten to fifteen seconds before dying off. And this was after it was left on the charger for two and a half days!!!!!!</li>
    <li> it recharges and works like it is supposed to</li>
    <li> I only use an electric razor on my legs, and this one works well and swiftly. I&#x27;ve only used it dry.</li>
    <li> I got this razor about 4 years ago as a Christmas gift and I absolutely loved it.  After about two years it quit working, so I took it apart and gave it a really good cleaning and it went right back to working like new.  So, I loved it again for two more years until tonight when my German Shepherd decided to eat it.  I was pretty disappointed because I figured it probably wouldn&#x27;t still be around to purchase.  I just did a quick search and it popped right up here on Amazon and I ordered another one tonight.  I am extremely happy to be getting another one.  :)  This time around I will be storing it on a higher shelf away from my crazy chew happy doggy.  (Oh and just to let you know, my dog is just fine and didn&#x27;t have any cuts or anything in her mouth.  Although she is sulking because I am making her sleep in the kitchen.)&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this razor and I was super happy to see it for only 16 dollars!</li>
    <li> it is even better than the one i used to have! shaves really close and neat. arrived very soon!love it</li>
    <li> I personally do NOT have tons of hair on my legs etc. So this works perfect for me. I can&#x27;t tell whether or how it would work on others. Postmenopausal here and the shave works great. I hate using razors because I cut myself...and frankly...pain in the butt for having light fine hair on my legs..this was the best solution for me.</li>
    <li> Lasted less than a month. Stopped recharging.</li>
    <li> I like this razor, it is best for your legs, left my underarms with razor burn. I deducted a star because it fits at an odd angle into the charger. I broke at least one razor when it fell from charger to floor. I keep it far back on counter now, so when, not if, it falls from charger, it lands on counter, not floor.</li>
    <li> Havent used this item and thought it would be  nice as a fill-in gift tor someone, but was disappointed in the overall appearance.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money ! We threw it out after a few months.</li>
    <li> This razor is junk. I hate it. You keep it in the charger to charge up and it dies very fast after you use it. I truly Hate it. When I first bought it , it was great but after the first use it ended up being horrible every time after that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I use it for my face. It works like a charm. Excellent product</li>
    <li> I went to clean &amp; it snapped &amp; broke The return window was Nov 9 &amp; it is Nov 21 too bad I didn&#x27;t clean sooner I only used 3 times What a waste of money</li>
    <li> The plastic holding the shaver in place broke after the second use. Horrible product.</li>
    <li> This is the WORST Razor I&#x27;ve ever had. It is worse than using a straight blade. It won&#x27;t hold a charge and when it does charge you get less than 5 minutes of running time out of it. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!</li>
    <li> This product lasted for about 2 months, but, as no returns are accepted, I must keep this item.  It doesn&#x27;t work at all because the bottom battery pack doesn&#x27;t stay in place and it can&#x27;t recharge.  It was not a very good shave anyway.  Wish I could return it!  Not a product to recommend.</li>
    <li> Razor not smooth on skin and gets too warm.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product months ago.. haven&#x27;t had time to write a review. It arrived pretty fast, which was a good thing. However, after using it twice I dropped it on my sink, and the side piece that holds the blades on either side broke. I still decided to use it after that, until the foil sheet on top has now been cut by the actual blade and this can be VERY dangerous. Even in the 2 times that I used this product, it shows no &amp;#34;satiny smooth&amp;#34; results. Its actually awkward to hold because you can&#x27;t get at an angle with the shape of the product. Cheap product... purchasing a Wahl battery-operated shaver instead. I&#x27;ve actually used it and its worth the money. Conair needs to stick to hair care instead of hair removal.</li>
    <li> Very smooth. Really nice shaver. I had bought a competitor and it pulled the hairs and the cut was terrible. Very pleased with this one. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s legs aren&#x27;t so hairy! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this a year ago and it worked great. It fell this week and when I tried to use it i realise that it is no more:( I&#x27;m going to buy a new one today because this shaver really was a good shaver (I just have to make sure the new one does not fall)</li>
    <li> The Satiny Smooth Conair razor is the best!! Easy to charge and no pain! It doesn&#x27;t pull like some razors do. The only complaint that I honestly have is that I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;ll last about a year to a year and 1/2 before it starts getting dull and needs to be replaced, but the price is good. Not to give too much info, but I use the razor on my legs and on my umm &amp;#34;bikini&amp;#34; area. So no pulling and way less razor burn than when I use a regular razor and I use it dry! It&#x27;s also easy to clean. I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my bikini line - very smooth and close shave and a quality product.  I have wasted money on shavers before.  Should have bought this one in the first place!</li>
    <li> Chose this one over getting the same one I used before.  Does give a close shave, just don&#x27;t use hard pressure and the combs won&#x27;t scrape your legs. Good product.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve had this for about 3 weeks, only used it about 6 times for a total of maybe 45 min and it won&#x27;t turn on! The green light that shows it&#x27;s charging is on, but it won&#x27;t do anything. I&#x27;ve used disposable razors longer!&lt;br /&gt;It was ok when it was working. Didn&#x27;t get super close, but i didn&#x27;t really expect it to. Would be nice if the trimmers could be removed or hidden for doing areas like your legs or underarm area. You have to hold the shaver perfectly perpendicular to your skin or the trimmers will leave drag lines.</li>
    <li> Works better than many higher priced razors. Very convenient.</li>
    <li> Never owned an electric razor before. Comfortable to hold. Does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;So far very satisfied. I would recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> This shaver worked great for about 4 months before the battery completely died and now won&#x27;t even hold a charge. It is going in the trash.</li>
    <li> Tried dry a little, seemed to do fine ... Will use in shower next time!  So far, so good! We&#x27;ll see!</li>
    <li> This is a perfect first razor for a young lady.  I felt much better about this than a traditional razor.</li>
    <li> I had an electric shaver [[ASIN:B000G0GW6K Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver with Bikini Attachment, Mauve]] that worked fine, except that the charging mechanism was not good.  After a couple of years, it completely stopped charging due to the faulty design.  That shaver is twice the cost of this shaver so I got this one to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy to try this and discover that the quality of the shave is very good.  It has a great shave for an electric razor (which in my experience isn&#x27;t as good as a disposable razor).  Interestingly, according the the instructions if you push too hard you do not get a good shave.  So I experimented and that is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes me extremely happy about this one over the other one (other than the cost) is that this one has a charging base that it sits in.  That base is then plugged into the socket with a cord.  This design is far superior and has less chance of failing---and certainly would never fail in the way that the other one did.  It also doesn&#x27;t require careful placing in a socket to avoid using to sockets.  And it can also be used in small bathrooms where the socket is turned sideways.  The other razor could not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely happy with this.  Replacement foils and blades are easy to find on amazon.</li>
