      <li>The handle is designed well and is comfortable in the hand.  </li>
      <li>This is my second purchase of this wonderful bath brush, my first was about two years when it first came out.  </li>
      <li>Easy and fun to use.</li>
      <li>This Bath Body Brush with Natural Bristles by Reng&amp;ouml;ra is quite nice.</li>
      <li>Feels good on my back and handle has rubber grip</li>
      <li>so I could easily use it on my whole body.</li>
      <li>have followed the easy care instructions - shaking off or manually removing excess water from the handle and head, then applying and gently rubbing in, olive oil - and these measures have maintained my brush in tip-top shape since.  </li>
      <li>The brush is solid, well made and works nice during the shower.</li>
      <li>Very well made, and the bristles feel great - wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>grip on the handle is a nice touch, especially when your hands are soapy &amp; slippery.&lt;br</li>
      <li>There is a nice comfortable handle attached to the main brush for extra convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most people cannot reach the back area and hence cannot effectively clean that while showering.</li>
      <li>It seems like every body brush that I have used either has does nothing or has made me feel like I have taken the top ten layers off of my skin.  </li>
      <li>This was my first time using a Body Brush</li>
      <li>Love this back scrubber!!  </li>
      <li>I know that this brush had the feature of being able to detach from the handle, but to be honest didn&#x27;t think of it because I have owned many other brushes where the handle is too easily detachable and makes the brush nearly useless.  </li>
      <li>love how the brush makes it so easy for my to cover my entire body in the same time it took my to cover 50% of my body when I showered before finding this product​.</li>
      <li>Instead of being ramrod straight, the brush is angled to better reach my back.</li>
      <li>The handle is a bit slick, but it has a rubber grip at the end that gives you a good place to hang on to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In other words, I hadn&#x27;t found the right brush for me--no company had been able to meet my expectations until now.</li>
      <li>Love this brush, it is such high quality.</li>
      <li>I will, or if I need one to give away as a gifts, I will certainly purchase them.  </li>
      <li>The shape of the Rengora Bath Brush make it easy to get to hard-to-reach places and the design makes it easy to handle even for small hands.</li>
      <li>It really makes you feel like you are getting</li>
      <li>I am very grateful for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When it comes to body brushes, I had given up on the whole concept.</li>
      <li>It lathers up a lot more than I expected it to.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good body brush or if you have mobility issues and have a hard time reaching everything to clean, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It really makes your back feel so clean without making it feel like you have taken a wire brush to yourself.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had to throw away so many brushes due to molding, the bristles clumping together or the handle breaking off.</li>
      <li>Overall this brush is definitely made of good quality material and is built to last.</li>
      <li>The brush is made of wood and the bristles are not at all pricking and instead are pretty soft.</li>
      <li>I really love my brush and am very grateful I no longer have to strain my wrists to reach every part of my upper back.  </li>
      <li>The main issue?</li>
      <li>The boar bristles hold up to giving your back a good, pleasing scrubbing without being harsh.  </li>
      <li>High quality, yet sturdy.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>The brush was covered with a cellophane wrapper and tied with a cute little bow.  </li>
      <li>It has stayed in place very well so far</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m lazy with showering. In all honesty, I would only wash wherever my hand can reach, so that would be only slightly behind my shoulders, a small part of my lower back and a little behind my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how the brush makes it so easy for my to cover my entire body in the same time it took my to cover 50% of my body when I showered before finding this product​. The construction is great, and I love how it pulls apart so I can focus on specific areas I want to concentrate on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually enjoy my showers now-it isn&#x27;t just a chore anymore. The unexpected boost in confidence of coming out the shower perfectly clean was a very nice surprise!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:388ee7cb1880cba7a06f243590e816c1]]Let me start off by saying that I go through several body brushes every year.  The main issue? The bristles either fall out or handle falls off.  Usually within the first week or two of use!  This Bath Body Brush by Reg&amp;ouml;ra is not like the others I have bought at the pharmacy store.  Out of the box I could tell this brush was extremely well made.  I did a tension stress test on the bristles by pulling very hard on them one by one.  Not one bristle fell out!  That right there told me this brush was well designed and built to last.  The other thing I did was pull tightly on the handle.  The tongue and groove design often found on wooden handle body brushes usually don&#x27;t hold up very well and can easily be pulled out.  The handle on this brush did not budge at all.  No wiggling or anything.  I am truly impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle has a nice rubber texturized grip which is perfect for when your hands are all soapy in the bath or shower and you are using body wash or other soap...the brush will not slip out of your hands.  There is a nice comfortable handle attached to the main brush for extra convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very satisfied with this body brush and the Reg&amp;ouml;ra brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATE**** 8/23/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously I had stated that the brush and handle seemed to be tightly in place. I know that this brush had the feature of being able to detach from the handle, but to be honest didn&#x27;t think of it because I have owned many other brushes where the handle is too easily detachable and makes the brush nearly useless.  However, recently I wanted to use the brush for my feet, and the handle was cumbersome so I wanted to detach it.  I noticed that others have had similar issues so here is a video on how to safely detach it without damaging the strap or brush.  The video is short, but it shows that if you firmly grasp the main brush and wiggle it and pull out the handle at the same time, it does remove.  After the first time it isn&#x27;t so hard to detach, it&#x27;s just the initial detaching that is a bit snug.  Hope this helps!es remove.  After the first time it isn&#x27;t so hard to detach, it&#x27;s just the initial detaching that is a bit snug.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This Bath Body Brush with Natural Bristles by Reng&amp;ouml;ra is quite nice. It&#x27;s wooden and the handle is a little over 17-in. long. The handle is very smooth and has a grip with ridges at the end of it for a better grasp of the handle when using it. The bristles are boar hair and are soft but still have the ability to scrub without damaging your skin. My husband has a shaving cream brush made with boar&#x27;s hair, too, so I knew, from the feel of the shaving brush, that this would be the perfect choice. The handle detaches from the brush so that the brush can be used by itself. It has a string cloth loop handle on the brush head. I have owned a few long-handled brushes that detach several years back and when I would use them with the long handles, the brush heads just wouldn&#x27;t stay on the handles. With this Brush by Reng&amp;ouml;ra, however, that doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem for me. It has stayed in place very well so far and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with separation when using. The bristles haven&#x27;t fallen out yet either. Overall, I&#x27;m really liking this Bath Body Brush and I love that it&#x27;s long enough to fully scrub my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free so that I may test it out and write an honest, unbiased product review. All opinions expressed are truly my own.</li>
    <li> Not to embarrass you but have you ever applied soap or body wash to the exact back of yourself ? I guess most people will shyingly answer as No. Nothing to be surprised about here. Most people cannot reach the back area and hence cannot effectively clean that while showering. This bath body brush comes in a nice box packaging. I expected it will be loosely packed without any box but I was surprised. Out of the box, the brush is extremely well packed with a beautiful plastic with some design covering the top “brush” portion.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that the attention to detail, the manufacturer has given while constructing this brush.Also at the bottom of the brush where we actually hold it, there is a rubberized grip. Another example of common sense thinking by the manufacturer. The brush is made of wood and the bristles are not at all pricking and instead are pretty soft. Due to its curved design and adequate length, you can reach almost all areas of the back properly without having to stress your hands in awkward positions. Especially the areas where your hands directly cannot reach.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if anyone has noticed but the brush head is actually detachable. This means that the long handle and the actual head can be separated. Also the head has a grip holder sort of behind its back. With the detachable head, you can use it on your knees or behind your legs etc to remove the dead skin. But don’t worry about accidently removing the head when the entire brush and handle is used as single unit. Overall this brush is definitely made of good quality material and is built to last. Make cleaning hard to reach places easy.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange of a honest review.</li>
    <li> This review is for:&lt;br /&gt;Best Bath Brush with Natural Bristles presented by Reng&amp;ouml;ra - Premium Wooden Shower Brush - for Soothing Skin Cleansing, Dry Brushing, &amp; Gentle Exfoliating - Upgrade Your Wet / Dry Body Brush Today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m really liking this brush. My old loofah was hard and felt too rough on my skin. The bristles on this brush are firm enough to get me nice and clean, but not so tough that it takes off 3 layers of skin in the process. I have some minor mobility issues, and it makes it much easier to reach my back. The handle is a bit slick, but it has a rubber grip at the end that gives you a good place to hang on to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, it&#x27;s difficult to separate the brush from the handle. What you need to do is firmly grip the brush and wiggle it back and forth a bit until it loosens up and comes off. It&#x27;s a great tool. It lathers up a lot more than I expected it to. I&#x27;ve noticed a couple bristles came loose, but that was just the first time using it, I haven&#x27;t noticed any since then. If you&#x27;re looking for a good body brush or if you have mobility issues and have a hard time reaching everything to clean, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;I received this brush free or discounted in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

    <li> What a great brush.  The bristles are soft enough to use on sensitive skin, yet stiff enough to scrub effectively.  The handle is designed well and is comfortable in the hand.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Super happy with my brush! It&#x27;s easy to hold, not too heavy and the bristles are perfect for my taste as I like a good scrub.</li>

    <li> Love this brush, it is such high quality. Easy and fun to use.</li>
    <li> All went well, as add stated.</li>
    <li> A pleasure to use! High quality, yet sturdy.  A perfect accompaniment for fine soaps and bath gels.</li>
    <li> When it comes to body brushes, I had given up on the whole concept. I&#x27;ve had to throw away so many brushes due to molding, the bristles clumping together or the handle breaking off. In other words, I hadn&#x27;t found the right brush for me--no company had been able to meet my expectations until now. I absolutely love the attention to detail that was put into this product. Instead of being ramrod straight, the brush is angled to better reach my back. The handle is ribbed, so you don&#x27;t drop it while showering and there is a plastic base attached to the bristles so that molding doesn&#x27;t occur. So far, the bristles have not been clumping and it&#x27;s in the right balance between moderate and soft exfoliation. Even the wooden construction of the brush itself is clearly well made. Today, I was so sad when the top part broke off from the stick but it what I didn&#x27;t realize is that the brush is supposed to separate. You get the best of both worlds!!! You can detach it as a hand scrub and then reattach it as a back brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with this product. I will always purchase this brand from now on. It is a beautiful product, well crafted and a great design.</li>
    <li> Best bath brush ever !!!</li>
    <li> This was my first time using a Body Brush and I can&#x27;t believe it has taken me this long. The shape of the Rengora Bath Brush make it easy to get to hard-to-reach places and the design makes it easy to handle even for small hands. I work outdoors and usually come home super dirty, the natural bristles help scrub the grime away without being too rough on my skin.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this wonderful brush!  It really makes your back feel so clean without making it feel like you have taken a wire brush to yourself.  It seems like every body brush that I have used either has does nothing or has made me feel like I have taken the top ten layers off of my skin.  This brush is the happy medium.  The handle is long enough that you can actually get all of those hard to reach places with ease.  There&#x27;s also a really neat handle on the back of the brush head that allows you to get places like the back of your neck sufficiently.  I also love the way that it came packaged.  The brush was covered with a cellophane wrapper and tied with a cute little bow.  It really makes you feel like you are getting the royal treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Good quality bath brush. Bristles are firm enough to scrub well without being scratchy. Handle curve is designed well, allowing the bather to apply pressure as desired. My former straight handled brush didn&#x27;t do this well. The wrapping around the handle makes gripping it with soapy hands easier.</li>
    <li> Love this back scrubber!!  Exceeded my expectation. Feels good on my back and handle has rubber grip so it doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hand. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and the curved handle is perfect.</li>
    <li> Good Brush.  Works well</li>
    <li> I ordered the Rengora brush and it arrived promptly the next day.  This brush came in very stylish packaging.  From the box it came in to the wrapping around the actual brush, it immediately gives one the feeling of relaxation and pampering.  The brush is well designed; with its curved, detachable, no-slip handle, and soft but sturdy bristles.  This is a great product all around!</li>
    <li> I was provided an option to try this, and it exceeded my expectation. The brush is solid, well made and works nice during the shower.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this wonderful bath brush, my first was about two years when it first came out.  I&#x27;ve purchased this second brush, not as a replacement, but as a gift for my boyfriend.  My first brush has not given me any problems, the bristles still appear as when I first purchased it, I see no &amp;quot;bald&amp;quot; spots, and both the wooden handle and the rubberized grip are still the same.  Also, no problems with detaching or re-attaching the head brush.  I am very grateful for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have followed the easy care instructions - shaking off or manually removing excess water from the handle and head, then applying and gently rubbing in, olive oil - and these measures have maintained my brush in tip-top shape since.  I really love my brush and am very grateful I no longer have to strain my wrists to reach every part of my upper back.  No more stress, plus the light &amp;quot;tingling&amp;quot; sensation after every shower is very relaxing and enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I ever need to replace my brush I will, or if I need one to give away as a gifts, I will certainly purchase them.  I am a very Happy customer.</li>
    <li> The brush is beautiful, I can see why it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;premium quality.&amp;#34; It is sturdy and the curves and design are just so well thought out. I don&#x27;t like my bath area cluttered with soaps and tools usually but this actually adds to the appearance of my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length is perfect for me, and I am about 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; in. It reaches a big range of area on my back. The brush is stiff when dry which I worried about, but when wet it is so gentle and soft. In particular I hope this brush helps clear my back of skin problems, but that&#x27;s jus a hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kinda wish the top was detachable from the handle so I could easily use it on my whole body. It is a lovely way to get a good lather and wash skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was provided for the purpose of review. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Well made but as a dude it&#x27;s not as big, or bristles as stiff, as I&#x27;d like them to be. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again. The search continues for the perfect men&#x27;s bath brush...</li>
    <li> Great Bath Brush! Very well made, and the bristles feel great - wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;The handle strap fits perfectly and allows the brush to be used easily for any part of your body.&lt;br /&gt;Rubber grip on the handle is a nice touch, especially when your hands are soapy &amp; slippery.&lt;br /&gt;11/04/2015 Update:  Had a minor problem develop with this product, so I contacted Reng&amp;ouml;ra Customer Service directly.&lt;br /&gt;Their response was fast, positive, and what you wish ALL CS departments were like.&lt;br /&gt;Kudos on having a great Customer Focus and follow-up.  I Highly recommend this company and ALL their products, and would buy from them in the future with complete confidence.</li>
    <li> I have only had it for a couple of weeks but it seems to be very well made and looks like it will last a long time. I bought a different Brand previously and it lasted about 2 weeks and was very poorly made.</li>
    <li> This brush is well made, looks nice,  and is a pleasure to use.  The boar bristles hold up to giving your back a good, pleasing scrubbing without being harsh.  The loop at the back of the brush head is a nice feature because when I need to scrub the back of my upper arms, I can apply extra pressure.  I like that the handle as a rubber area on the handle so I can maintain a good grip.  Basically, I wish I had bought this brush earlier.  I look forward to using it each day.</li>
    <li> It is softer than expected, and very well made.</li>
