      <li>I love it :)</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>I love this tool.  </li>
      <li>Many more uses than just for makeup.</li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>I intend to get more of them for gifts for the ladies in my family.</li>
      <li>and I am glad I didn&#x27;t since there was a lot more of the product inside.</li>
      <li>Glad I purchased it.</li>
      <li>This is just ok.</li>
      <li>Just wish there were more sizes to choose from.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad this was invented.  </li>
      <li>it gave me 2 more weeks.  </li>
      <li>So much better than a cotton</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s adding weeks or more to use where it would have been thrown out.</li>
      <li>Such a great invention!</li>
      <li>I managed to get most of the makeup out though.</li>
      <li>I love it, and it will save me a bundle in un-used product.</li>
      <li>I was impressed enough to purchase three more to give as gifts.  </li>
      <li>I got lots of foundation out of my L&#x27;Oreal bottle once the pump wouldn&#x27;t pump up any more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s wider on the top but this can be pushed into the bottle&#x27;s neck.</li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>spatula is larger than is best for most of the bottles I use it for.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a use for it eventually</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>But if you want it for make-up... ABSOLUTELY!!!!  </li>
      <li>This was definitely worth the price!!</li>
      <li>I easily get 12 more days of use out of the product that I otherwise would have thrown away.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s ideal for larger containers too.  </li>
      <li>I saw a product similar to this on &amp;#34;Shark Tank&amp;#34; and thought it was brilliant.</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how much more there was in the bottle that would&#x27;ve been thrown away otherwise!!  </li>
      <li>I get 2-3 more days worth of foundation out of each of my bottles!</li>
      <li>Easy in.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fine for both of them.</li>
      <li>Nice long handle, good shape to get to all areas of the makeup bottle.</li>
      <li>A great little tool for so many uses!</li>
      <li>I especially love the little part that fits under the edges.</li>
      <li>This does the trick, and I liked it so much, I bought one for my daughter.</li>
      <li>This spatula works fantastic.</li>
      <li>Seems like a luxury, but it&#x27;s quite handy and doesn&#x27;t take up much room in your medicine cabinet.</li>
      <li>Great gadget to get the last of skincare!</li>
      <li>It has fit inside every bottle I&#x27;ve tried it on.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and well made.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t fit inside my make up bottle that I bought it for</li>
      <li>It worked great with my moisturizer bottle but was way too big for my foundation container.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great addition to my makeup tools. Only down side is products that have an opening too small for the spatula... but that&#x27;s rare.  Such a great invention!</li>
    <li> Like the smallness of this and the shape and the rubber as it goes around small spaces.  Works great in small bottles.  You would need a larger one for larger bottles.</li>
    <li> This works great. Highly recommend because nobody likes wasting product.</li>
    <li> My new favorite beauty tool!!! Helps me get my money&#x27;s worth out of my liquid foundation!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use with small lotion bottles and the spatula is way too big to fit inside. If you are purchasing this item for a bottle with a large opening, it would work great.</li>
    <li> This could be a great product, but after I overpaid for it, it didn&#x27;t fit in the bottles I needed it for. This will not fit in a MAC foundation bottle.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my frugal daughter!  Now that I&#x27;m aware I want one for myself &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Ingenious little tool - I use mainly for getting moisturizer out of jars. A great addition to my make-up box.</li>
    <li> Great to get everything out of a bottle. With the cost of facial creams this will pay for it self fast</li>
    <li> Perfect for reaching the corners of any bottle....gotta get every last drop of my product!</li>
    <li> Easy in.  Not so easy out, especially with goop on the end.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most useful little tools I have in my make-up case. Make-up is expensive, and this nifty gadget makes sure that I get every last bit out of the jar or bottle. Although mine has paid for itself many times over, I agree with other reviewers that it can be found for much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have their Lip Spatula for lipstick. I love that, too, because there is always so much left in the tube that I can&#x27;t get to, even with Q-tips. I recently went to replenish a favorite lipstick color only to find out that it had been discontinued. Not happy about that, but very happy that I was able get every last bit of what I had out of the tube. The Lip Spatula is also handy for makeup containers with small openings, like concealer tubes, that the Beauty Spatula can&#x27;t easily access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are very useful products to have.</li>
    <li> The head is larger than some makeup bottles.</li>
    <li> This was too big for all of my foundation bottles. It seems like if you have a bottle or jar with a big enough opening to fit this thing into, it should be big enough to fit your finger into anyway, so what&#x27;s the point in having this large of a spatula?</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting, but I had higher hopes. It works as it should, tho it stained the very first time I used it (with my pot foundation). I&#x27;m glad I bought it, but wish it was a little narrower to fit into slim necked bottles.</li>
    <li> works perfectly and helps me get the most use out of my products!</li>
    <li> Works very well! It has fit inside every bottle I&#x27;ve tried it on. Great gadget to get the last of skincare!</li>
    <li> Could be a little bigger</li>
    <li> The spatula is much bigger than I had expected. It doesn&#x27;t fit into the Hourglass primer bottle, but does fit into clinique dramatically different gel bottle for reference.</li>
    <li> Brillant item! worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> This was too big to fit into the bottles of all of the products (mostly foundations and moisturizers) that I bought it for. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a use for it eventually but if they had included a smaller spatula on the other end of it would be sooo much more useful!</li>
    <li> Works like a dream. My only advice is to wash it everytime after using or the rubber my become stained.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these, at a beauty supply store and loved it. Of course, I also promptly lost it and couldn&#x27;t find a replacement, until I checked Amazon. This is such a help with getting every drop of lotion, or makeup, from it&#x27;s container. Definitely a money saver, considering the cost of most beauty supplies!&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> This little spatula works like a dream.  I wish I would have known about it sooner.  I thought my pump makeup was empty.  I was able to open it, use this spatula and get an extra week worth of product out of the bottle.  That is well worth the cost of the spatula...especially if you use an expensive makeup.  I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> A money saver! It really works.</li>
    <li> The plastic stains, but it does the job!</li>
    <li> What a great idea!  Works well.  Makes a great hostess gift.  Buy a few.</li>
    <li> I saw a product similar to this on &amp;#34;Shark Tank&amp;#34; and thought it was brilliant. Most of my makeup/foundation is in glass bottles and I can never get all of it out. This lil guy does the job! I love it :)</li>
    <li> This tool is great. Gets every last drop of product! Wish it had a sheild to put it in when not in use.</li>
    <li> I love this tool.  I am able to get every little bit of expensive product out of the tubes and jars.  My Scot Grandmother would be proud of me.  I intend to get more of them for gifts for the ladies in my family.</li>
    <li> Exactly as shown and works great!</li>
    <li> I use this all the time to get the makeup out the bottom of my MAC foundation bottles. Glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> ove this product but expensive u can find something similar at Bed Bath and Beyond cheaper and works just as good</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive my beauty spatula.  I had several (6) foundation bottles that had so much make-up left in them.  I held onto the bottles because I wanted to see if there was a product that would help.  I found the Beauty Spatula and couldn&#x27;t wait to receive the product.  The company is so professional, service was super fast, and I have already recommended this product to my friends.  The spatula works just as advertised, I&#x27;ve used it over and over again already and can now throw away the bottles knowing that I got almost every inch of the product out.  There was so much left in the bottle that wouldn&#x27;t pump out, that I was able to use what the Beauty Spatula got out for several more facial applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to everyone who is wasting money by throwing out partial used bottles.</li>
    <li> I read about this in Reader&#x27;s Digest, of all places. And it was so highly rated I bought three. I was tired of not being able to get the remaining product out of high-end makeup bottles, and this works great. Best invention ever!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s about time there is something to get the last bits out.....</li>
    <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve gotten one of these a long time ago. It makes getting the remains of product so much easier. A solution for one of life&#x27;s little annoyances.</li>
    <li> I should&#x27;ve invested in this a long time ago. I especially love the little part that fits under the edges.</li>
    <li> Over priced.  I&#x27;ve seen the same item on other sites, much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the head is too large to fit into most of my bottles, so it&#x27;s basically unusable to me.</li>
    <li> It worked great with my moisturizer bottle but was way too big for my foundation container.</li>
    <li> i saw this on Shark Tank...and thought what a great idea,  I can not believe how much make up/foundation was left om tje bottle what a waste of supply and most important money...thank you Every Drop Beauty Spatula..Joan</li>
    <li> Works great. I no longer feel like I&#x27;m throwing out expensive beauty products.</li>
    <li> Helped me get every last bit of moisturizer out. Might be hard to use for smaller bottle such as foundation unless top comes completely off</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend. She had some very expensive makeup and wanted to get every last drop out of the bottle. She just couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked...and was thrilled with it.</li>
    <li> waste of money. wish I could get a refund</li>
    <li> Great stocking stuffer gifts or to give to someone just because this spatula is going to be one of your favorite products.</li>
    <li> I love this.  I used to cut open bottles to get out the last drop...this saves me the hassle.  Worth the price for the convenience.</li>
    <li> Cheapish plastic, but does the job.</li>
    <li> It annoyed me when the pump on my Aveeno Facial Moisturizer would fail to get every last drop out of the container. No matter how much a banged the bottle around, some would always stick to the bottom and corners. With this tool, it gets it all! I&#x27;ve managed to get an extra week or twos worth of product out of the bottle due to this nifty little thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad this was invented.  The only qualm I have is that the long plastic handle will break. Metal might be too heavy, but maybe heavier plastic would be better.</li>
    <li> I love this cute little makeup spatula! It&#x27;s so convenient and useful. If you&#x27;re a makeup/product junkie that doesn&#x27;t like waisting, (like I am) this is the perfect problem solver for those empty bottles left with product caked on the inner walls. It&#x27;s long too, so it works in just about any size bottle or jar. I only bought one and I use it for everything. It&#x27;s washable so it will last you a long time. Great gift for a makeup artist, if they don&#x27;t already have one!</li>
    <li> The spatula is a little bigger than I was expecting, but it does fit into the mouth of my Aveeno &amp;#34;positively radiant daily moisturizer&amp;#34; bottle, which was the main reason I bought it.</li>
    <li> Works well to scrape out the last of foundation or moisturizer left in the bottle.</li>
    <li> great make-up stretching tool.  could not find in the stores</li>
    <li> Bought two of these as stocking stuffers...Mine has already been put to work. could not believe how much Bare Minerals primer I was about to toss - I think I got at least another 10 days worth after using this tool. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This spatula works fantastic. it truly does get every drop of make up out of the bottle. It could have been made just a little smaller. but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This spatula is really useful and I have used it to mix my own custom foundation shades. I also used it the other day to rehydrate my cream shadows that had dried out by adding a little bit of argan oil into the shadow. I used the spatula to stir the product together and it created a really nice fluffy cream shadow again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the rubber head on this seems a bit unstable and that I find the grooved sides of the spatula catches a lot of product and makes it difficult to swipe product evenly into a jar in one go.</li>
    <li> This product get every drop out of very small bottles (like foundation make up, skin care products).  These items are expensive and this spatula get to the bottom and cleans the sides so well.</li>
    <li> Money saving tool right here!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a surprisingly useful device. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the head coming off.</li>
    <li> The spatula fits into the small opening of foundation bottle.  I can take out variable amounts as needed.  Given how often airless pumps fail, this is a great tool to have on hand.  Wash with warm water and soap, let dry -- and it&#x27;s ready for use again.</li>
    <li> This is just ok. It&#x27;s just a little too big to get in and out of my makeup bottle without forcing it, and the angle is just a bit off for scraping the sides. I managed to get most of the makeup out though.</li>
    <li> I brought this little spatula  off amazon and I love it this thing gets all the liquid make up from the bottle it&#x27;s amazing .</li>
    <li> works great.  Use it everday</li>
    <li> This is super useful!  The tip bends well, making it easy to get into tight corners and get the last bit of makeup out.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and well made.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t fit inside my make up bottle that I bought it for</li>
    <li> It is actually not small and doesn&#x27;t fit into small tunes of make up</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I wanted and works great.  However, the only problem that I now see is that the handle is not sturdy enough and want to bend when you try to clean the jar or bottle.</li>
    <li> This worked very well for getting every bit of eye cream out of the bottle after I could pump no more out and couldn&#x27;t scoop anymore out with the tube to the pump.  I was surprised at how much more there was in the bottle that would&#x27;ve been thrown away otherwise!!  This was definitely worth the price!!</li>
    <li> There used to be a lot of lotions and creams hiding in the neck of the bottles I buy....BUT NOT ANYMORE! Whoever invented this is a genius!</li>
    <li> I am super frugal when it comes to getting all my expensive product out of the bottles...especially the $160.00 Orlane serum I use...I want all that I paid for. This little tool is easily inserted through the small hole, it gets under the neck of the bottle, the bottom sides...it get&#x27;s it all !&lt;br /&gt;Everydrop is also my new daily applicator to go into jars as it prevents germs from my fingers from entering my make-up.  LOVE you EVERYDROP beauty spatula !</li>
    <li> It drives me crazy to think of how much expensive foundation I&#x27;ve wasted before I purchased this spatula! I&#x27;m getting a good &amp;#34;5 more faces&amp;#34; out of my foundation bottles by using this product! The spatula itself is a little too large to fit into the Mac Studio Fix fluid foundation bottle, but I&#x27;m able to work it in there. With practice, you&#x27;ll be able to scoop out about 95% of the product left in a small bottle. So happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> The spatula is OK though one feels that much of the price must be for the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spatula is larger than is best for most of the bottles I use it for. It does squeeze into the make up bottle and facial moisturizer that I use- but just barely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the maker should sell this one and a smaller and shorter one in one package - preferably for about the same price!</li>
    <li> What an amazing little tool!!  I saw this reviewed on youtube by graveyardgirl and had to have it.  I&#x27;m always so frustrated that I can&#x27;t get the last little bit of moisturizer, serum or makeup out of the jar.  This little spatula is tiny and is the perfect size and shape for reaching in and grabbing the dregs at the bottom or around the top.  It&#x27;s a great addition to my makeup tool collection.  It also has a long handle so it&#x27;s ideal for larger containers too.  I have expensive perfumed lotion and it&#x27;s always a drag to have to pitch the containers when there&#x27;s still a little bit left.  Now I can get what I paid for, lol!  No woman should be without this handy little tool.  Whoever thought this up deserves an award!  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really review the effectiveness of this product, as I purchased it for my expensive makeup loving daughter, but I can say she was pretty thrilled with it, and said she&#x27;d never seen one before.  definitely a 100% hit as a stocking stuffer!</li>
    <li> I often practically demolish my containers of cream, lotion, or make up to get the remaining product at the bottom.  This does the trick, and I liked it so much, I bought one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised. I get 2-3 more days worth of foundation out of each of my bottles!</li>
    <li> I wish I had thought of this idea...it&#x27;s a little bitty spatula that fits in makeup bottles and helps get every last bit of makeup out so none is wasted.  I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> It is great for getting that last drop of makeup or lotion.  Perfect size and shape, easy to clean between uses.</li>
    <li> Love this spatula!  Hate to have to rinse away or throw out the last drops of my favorite lotions, glosses, etc.  The Every Drop Beauty Spatula prevents this problem.</li>
    <li> This spatula does just what it is designed to do. Nice long handle, good shape to get to all areas of the makeup bottle.</li>
    <li> Great little gadgit.  I use it as an artist tool for ink and paint.</li>
    <li> I found it cheaper in store after I bought on amazon, but by that time it had already saved me more than I paid (that&#x27;s a slight overstatement) so I&#x27;m not too hurt. I bought four of them when I found them on clearance, for gifts? because everyone needs them and it&#x27;s so fascinating to see a foundation bottle clean.</li>
    <li> This product saves so much frustration! When you get to the bottom of a lotion bottle, it is difficult to get out the remaining product. The spatula makes it possible to do that, so you don&#x27;t feel you are wasting money. I bought five of them, and gave four as gifts to women in my family. All of us agree that we love it, and would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Every household should have one of these. Many more uses than just for makeup. Anything in a tube can be cleaned out completely when you squeeze the last bit to the open end and cut the other end off. If you still haven&#x27;t used all the product, just put a clip on the cut end. I bought several as stocking stuffers for grown ups. A great little tool for so many uses!</li>
    <li> Like this a lot, now I can get to all the makeup in the bottom of the bottle!</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery, item works as described.</li>
    <li> havent tryed it yet but i can see it would work good</li>
    <li> Pro: handle is long and has the right amount of flex.&lt;br /&gt;Con: have to force the spatula head into the bottle (this was on a bottle of Stila foundation.) Once it&#x27;s in there, the head isn&#x27;t flexible enough to collect a good amount of product *and* bring it back out of the bottle. I think I could have gotten the same amount out of the bottle by leaving it upside down for a few days then whacking it against my open palm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this for bottles with narrow openings.</li>
    <li> This product delivered as promised and did exactly what I was hoping.  I was impressed enough to purchase three more to give as gifts.  Definitely helps extend the life of whatever product you are trying to stretch. The size is perfect to enter tiny bottles and the odd design ensures every last drop is extracted. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this. I got a week more out of my moisturizer with this! It paid for itself with that one week!</li>
    <li> I like this spatula becaues it helps me to get the last drop out of my face care product bottles, making it a very thrifty item. Well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Every lady should have this in there cosmetic supply.  I got so much face make up out that bottle it gave me 2 more weeks.  Who would no want that?</li>
    <li> Everything about it is perfect. It is small enough to get into those small bottles and the shape gets every drop.</li>
    <li> I wish I had found this earlier. Gets the very last drop of skincare products out of jars. I&#x27;ve used it for serums and gels. So much better than a cotton swab.&lt;br /&gt;It looks like it may not work for bottled foundations, since the necks of those types of bottles are very narrow.</li>
    <li> The spatula is much bigger than expected and will likely not fit in most foundation openings. It barely fits in my ELF primer with some force.</li>
    <li> this is great, I ordered one for me and one for my sister-in-law and we&#x27;ve both put it to good use</li>
    <li> Indispensable for really getting every last bit out of those awkward cosmetics jars - can&#x27;t believe how much I was previously leaving behind. I love this thing!</li>
    <li> on time and as described</li>
    <li> This is great - there&#x27;s always a few applications of whatever is in that bottle that you can&#x27;t get to at the end of the &amp;#34;pumps and squeezes&amp;#34; and this spatula gets every last drop, as advertised.  Highly recommend this little thing!</li>
    <li> Not a brain teaser just a small spatula that fits in make-up bottle and gets every last drop that can be used..:)</li>
    <li> Good to the last drop.  Best thing I ever bought.</li>
    <li> DO NOT sterilize before using it the first time.  I made the mistake and ruined the plastic before being able to use it the first time.  So upsetting!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly!  Wish there was a slightly narrower one for even smaller containers.</li>
    <li> Can be a very useful tool to get every last bit of that product out of the bottle. I found it to be a little bigger than I was expecting, so it did not fit many of my bottles.</li>
    <li> This is useful for all sorts of things, not just for cosmetics. I use for crafts.</li>
    <li> Terrific!  huge saving tool for an old cheap Yankee!  Given the price of cosmetics these days, these really stretch my $.</li>
    <li> Everyone knows how expensive foundation is and that was my primary reason for buying it.  I haven&#x27;t used it on lotion bottles etc just small bottles.  It works great for the foundation.  I am not sure if the want would break if you were using it in a big bottle.  It doesn&#x27;t seem like it would be strong enough but can&#x27;t verify one way or another.  But if you want it for make-up... ABSOLUTELY!!!!  It works like a charm and has a little lip on it to get under the rim.  Also if you have a makeup bottle with a REALLY narrow opening it may not work.  I use 2 different foundations and it&#x27;s fine for both of them.</li>
    <li> finally a way to get every drop of product out of the bottle.  It&#x27;s adding weeks or more to use where it would have been thrown out.</li>
    <li> This spatula is a little bigger than I thought it would be but it worked well for getting makeup out of a small liquid foundation bottle. It&#x27;s wider on the top but this can be pushed into the bottle&#x27;s neck. I got lots of foundation out of my L&#x27;Oreal bottle once the pump wouldn&#x27;t pump up any more.</li>
    <li> LOVE this little spatula.  You have no idea how much product you waste until you use one of these.  I even cut the end off my plastic containers and get every last drop.</li>
    <li> this is way bigger than I expected - can&#x27;t imagine how I am going to get this in a majority of my small bottles - defeats the purpose of why I bought it.</li>
    <li> This product just saved me $37.00.  I was able to get every last drop out of my BB Cream tube.  I was going to discard the tube and I am glad I didn&#x27;t since there was a lot more of the product inside.</li>
    <li> Way too big a spatula to fit in any of my makeup containers and I own almost every kind of makeup there is. Not gonna work. Will try a different brand.</li>
    <li> Trying to get the last drop out of expensive beauty creams and lotions can be a royal pain. This spatula is just the right size and length to fit into most cosmetic bottles, making it easy to extract the last little bit of product. Seems like a luxury, but it&#x27;s quite handy and doesn&#x27;t take up much room in your medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> How did I not know about these? I love it, and it will save me a bundle in un-used product. Recommended to my sister and she loves her&#x27;s too.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed I didn&#x27;t buy this sooner. I realize how much product I&#x27;ve thrown away and now I never have to waste again!!! Works perfect and very durable.</li>
    <li> Agreed with others - the tip of this thing is way too big.  I bought it to scrape out the rest of my serum and it is more than double the size of the opening for the serum bottle.  I agree with what someone else said - this thing is as wide as my finger tip so why bother if I can just stick my finger in to scoop out?</li>
    <li> Total length (spatula plus handle) is 8 inches.  Spatula itself at it&#x27;s widest point is 9/16 inch (or just a little over 1/2 inch).  Does great getting under the edges of the bottle, gets bottom well.  However this tool is too wide to fit down in my Lancome foundation bottle, which is specifically what I bought it for so I was disappointed.  What it does fit, it does a great job.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Not sure how i lived so long without this product! no more wasted foundation!</li>
    <li> Good product...the tip could be a little wider to get a better scoop from the bottom of jars.</li>
    <li> Fits into all the very smallest of bottles that nothing else could clean out.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  No waste of expensive beauty products.</li>
    <li> I cut the end off my foaming face cleaner tube and the spatula works great at getting at the remaining product that can no longer be squeezed out. I easily get 12 more days of use out of the product that I otherwise would have thrown away. Love it ! Bought one for each of my daughters.</li>
    <li> Love the little spatula.  Just wish there were more sizes to choose from.</li>
    <li> great invention - saw it on shark tank and knew I had to have it!</li>
