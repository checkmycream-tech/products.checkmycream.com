      <li>Fantastic!</li>
      <li>These are far better and are also gorgeous!</li>
      <li>but its the perfect travel size,  Packaged nicely, brush allot softer than expected and for over sensitive skin it seems great.</li>
      <li>For the price, these brushes are pretty good.</li>
      <li>These brushes are very soft and great for even distribution on the eyelid.</li>
      <li>most cheap brushes do.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a grande effect of light pink/orange into a deeper orange.</li>
      <li>yet I really think this is a good starter set.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really know how these where going to hold up, so far so good!!</li>
      <li>This product is pretty nice.</li>
      <li>Love my new brushes they work amazing were affordable and got them within the timeframe that I was givin.</li>
      <li>Smooth movement on the face doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
      <li>theywere cheap</li>
      <li>I love these brushes, just the right size for traveling or just carrying around in your purse.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
      <li>Very emberassing!!!</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not mad!  </li>
      <li>The brushes are very soft and disperse my makeup products nice and evenly.</li>
      <li>The bristles are nice and soft.</li>
      <li>This set is good for starting out.  </li>
      <li>The thing that bothered me is that I got this set for my on the go makeup purse and most of all, specifically for the eyebrow brush (I once had a high quality eyebrow brush, it was super sturdy and love at first use</li>
      <li>I bought these brushes because of the price as a filler to get super saver shipping.</li>
      <li>They were much better than expected, very soft brushes and applies makeup great.</li>
      <li>The quality of the handles isn&#x27;t anything special but they are definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>They were pretty cheap</li>
      <li>But now that I&#x27;ve learned some new techniques for applying eyeshadow, I&#x27;m gonna need more brushes.</li>
      <li>They were cheap and started losing bristles here and there after a couple months, eventually I stopped using them all together because they were no longer very usable.</li>
      <li>The little sponge applicator is AMAZING!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have very much money to spend</li>
      <li>They are pretty though.  </li>
      <li>And they are VERY sturdy!</li>
      <li>but they are VERY sturdy!</li>
      <li>but overall they are okay</li>
      <li>Nice to have other brushes to use.</li>
      <li>Loved this brush set, although I did think the brushes were a little big bigger in size, aside from that they are stylish, and very sturdy.</li>
      <li>Really picks up the pigment.</li>
      <li>My roommate reported to me that the bristles do not fall out when cleaning the brushes, and the brushes very evenly apply make-up.</li>
      <li>These brushes suck, don&#x27;t buy them, they are very flimsy and they don&#x27;t distribute makeup evenly.</li>
      <li>I really used</li>
      <li>Very soft and fluffy easy to clean.</li>
      <li>so really the eyebrow brush was the first item to start breaking within the first month (the eyebrow comb part lost all the middle teeth) -</li>
      <li>the one in this set was definitely not it, I was hoping it would be because I have the ones with the full size handle) -</li>
      <li>These brushes look like they are full size in the picture shown..but they are tiny!</li>
      <li>Might be able to fix it with a little super glue, but I would warn others against getting this set if you want to avoid the same problem.</li>
      <li>The bristles are fine but the size was not what I was looking for or expected.</li>
      <li>Cute little brushes.</li>
      <li>I especially like the pretty handles which match the brush tips!</li>
      <li>I think it could have been a bit better quality, the bristles are stiff.  </li>
      <li>am new at the makeup thing</li>
      <li>The brushes are SOOOOO soft!</li>
      <li>The clear plastic case that comes with the brushes keeps them protected if you decide to keep them in your purse for make-up emergencies or travel a lot.</li>
      <li>They are softer than most brushes and they only costs me a few bucks.</li>
      <li>They work well enough, but these are just average makeup brushes there isn&#x27;t anything special about them.</li>
      <li>Price is very inexpensive, I would buy an extra for future replacement.</li>
      <li>but if they were any more expensive I would be highly disapointed but</li>
      <li>not exactly what i thought, but exactly what I needed, I thought it would be a larger set</li>
      <li>My recommendation would be to just go to Target and pick up the cheap brushes they have there, at least you can choose what you want and its the same quality at only about a dollar per brush.</li>

    <li> The brush set is of very good quality and for such a great price!  I especially like the pretty handles which match the brush tips! The brushes are very soft and disperse my makeup products nice and evenly.</li>
    <li> This set i a reali mini set for traveling or to keep in your purse as an emergency stash!  They look bigger on the pic ad but overall they are okay, I guess LOL!  They were pretty cheap but if they were any more expensive I would be highly disapointed but theywere cheap so I&#x27;m not mad!  Not reccommeded for you if this would be your 1st set of brushes though!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, just the right size for traveling or just carrying around in your purse.&lt;br /&gt;They feel as good as they look, get these ladies!</li>
    <li> My wife love it and if we take a look on the price of product and the quality of it, we will always think about to buy again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really know how these where going to hold up, so far so good!! I love my brushes. They are softer than most brushes and they only costs me a few bucks. If your not a pro yet I really think this is a good starter set. I LOVE EM&#x27;</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase! wonderful product and awesome service! i would recomend this to anybody that uses makeup. the brushes and really good and work great!</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes because of the price as a filler to get super saver shipping. I was not expecting such a great product! I am used to brushes that have loose brush bristles that fall out when you use them. These are far better and are also gorgeous! I have gotten several compliments on them from friends. Fantastic!</li>
    <li> The picture shows awesome brushes but overall very cheap mterial I guess you get what u pay for the bad thing was that it was a gift!!! Very emberassing!!!</li>
    <li> I had just started playing around with eyeshadow, so I needed a set that didn&#x27;t cost a lot.  This set is good for starting out.  But now that I&#x27;ve learned some new techniques for applying eyeshadow, I&#x27;m gonna need more brushes. I wish this set came with a rounded brush.  The 2 small brushes are flat.  I do like the fact that the brushes are sturdy, and of good quality.</li>
    <li> The verdict is that these brushes are O.K. They were cheap and started losing bristles here and there after a couple months, eventually I stopped using them all together because they were no longer very usable. The thing that bothered me is that I got this set for my on the go makeup purse and most of all, specifically for the eyebrow brush (I once had a high quality eyebrow brush, it was super sturdy and love at first use but I lost it so since then I&#x27;ve been looking for my \\&quot;Next Top\\&quot; eyebrow brush, the one in this set was definitely not it, I was hoping it would be because I have the ones with the full size handle) - so really the eyebrow brush was the first item to start breaking within the first month (the eyebrow comb part lost all the middle teeth) - and I know your thinking I probably used the heck out of it, where as I sadly didn&#x27;t - yes it was at that point, the only brush I really used but I wasn&#x27;t putting makeup on to hardcore metal and trying to break it off on my face. My recommendation would be to just go to Target and pick up the cheap brushes they have there, at least you can choose what you want and its the same quality at only about a dollar per brush.</li>
    <li> Cute little brushes. Plan on using them allot.  They came just as in the picture. No damaged ones. Will update when I use them.</li>
    <li> One of the brushes was broken upon receiving it.  The rest seem fine so far, but I was disappointed in the quality.  Might be able to fix it with a little super glue, but I would warn others against getting this set if you want to avoid the same problem.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes.great for beginners. Very soft and fluffy easy to clean. Perfect size for the purse for on the go touch ups.would recommend this to a friend or family member</li>
    <li> For the price, these brushes are pretty good. The bristles are nice and soft. The quality of the handles isn&#x27;t anything special but they are definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> not exactly what i thought, but exactly what I needed, I thought it would be a larger set but its the perfect travel size,  Packaged nicely, brush allot softer than expected and for over sensitive skin it seems great.</li>
    <li> These brushes are travel size. I like them, but I imagined they would be bigger. The looks of them are similar to the picture but there is no white on the bristles, as shown it looks white and then neon orange, well it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s more like a grande effect of light pink/orange into a deeper orange. They work well enough, but these are just average makeup brushes there isn&#x27;t anything special about them. I gave it three stars because the colors are different and because they are travel size.</li>
    <li> I got these brushes for my roommate. Besides looking very trendy, these brushes are very soft and are perfect for mineral make-up. My roommate reported to me that the bristles do not fall out when cleaning the brushes, and the brushes very evenly apply make-up. The clear plastic case that comes with the brushes keeps them protected if you decide to keep them in your purse for make-up emergencies or travel a lot. Great inexpensive stocking stuffer for all your the girls in your life!</li>
    <li> Loved this brush set, although I did think the brushes were a little big bigger in size, aside from that they are stylish, and very sturdy. They are not cheap feeling and the brush hairs dont fall out like normal ones.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty nice. I havnt had a chance to use all of the brushes yet. I notice that the brushes go a bit stiff while drying compared to my kabuki brush when I wash them. Its no problem though. I just run my fingers thru them to soften them up.</li>
    <li> These brushes look like they are full size in the picture shown..but they are tiny! Don&#x27;t be fooled. Quality is okay. I guess you get what you pay for though...</li>
    <li> Love my new brushes they work amazing were affordable and got them within the timeframe that I was givin. Very satisfied!!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft and great for even distribution on the eyelid. Smooth movement on the face doesn&#x27;t clump. I used the mona lisa pink soap brush cleaner for these brushes because the brushes hold regular soap, so I encourage you to use some type of brush cleaner.</li>
    <li> Nice travel companion. Fits well in my small make-up kit. Price is very inexpensive, I would buy an extra for future replacement. Item arrived quickly and in good packaging.</li>
    <li> (I&#x27;m Using my boyfriend&#x27;s account)&lt;br /&gt;I just received them in the mail with my eye shadow palette and played around with them. LOVE them!&lt;br /&gt;They are a bit small but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. The brushes are SOOOOO soft! Non of the bristles have fallen out. The little sponge applicator is AMAZING! I love the way it feels! Really picks up the pigment. I haven&#x27;t used the big brush or the eye brow brush yet. The eye brow brush seems very stiff and rough so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using it....(i&#x27;ll use the comb part tho).&lt;br /&gt;I am new at the makeup thing so I think this is perfect for a starter. I didn&#x27;t have very much money to spend so I think I got pretty good quality for spending $7! And they are VERY sturdy! They don&#x27;t wiggle around on the black part like most cheap brushes do. So I am REALLY glad about that! I was afraid that they would be poorly made and I would have to glue them but they are VERY sturdy! They DON&#x27;T have a funny smell at all like some brushes do.&lt;br /&gt;I am Very happy with this product and will be buying again!</li>
    <li> These brushes suck, don&#x27;t buy them, they are very flimsy and they don&#x27;t distribute makeup evenly. These are a waste of money</li>
    <li> I think it could have been a bit better quality, the bristles are stiff.  They are pretty though.  Nice to have other brushes to use.</li>
    <li> Came on time,packaged perfectly,and works great. Just what i needed!!</li>
    <li> Perfect set.. you&#x27;d think. Only its missing a brush. And in its place a sponge tip. Instead of angle brush. Not what I expected, so I am annoyed a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking for that perfect on the go set again...</li>
    <li> I read some reviews about the products size but I opened the package and was immediately disappointed when I saw how SMALL they were. The bristles are fine but the size was not what I was looking for or expected.</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes just to give them a try, they were inexpensive and figured if I didnt like them it would be a big loss. They were much better than expected, very soft brushes and applies makeup great. I will end up purchasing the bigger set.</li>
