      <li>smell is very sweet and natural, food-like,</li>
      <li>I saw this and the old ingredients listed and was super excited</li>
      <li>/&gt;Original formula that left my hair feeling great and deserves five stars (same as ingredients in product listing above):&lt;br /&gt;Disodium</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s pretty damaged.</li>

      <li>It cleans really well but doesn&#x27;t strip my hair or make it dull.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Catwalk Oatmeal &amp; Honey Shampoo is gentle (yet cleansing) for color treated hair.</li>

      <li>and I&#x27;m quite particular about the products that I use.</li>
      <li>It can be hard to find, but it&#x27;s worth the search!!!</li>
      <li>12/3/14&lt;br /&gt;I returned the four bottles from the first vendor and purchased from a different Amazon prime vendor and got the bottles with the correct ingredients.</li>

      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the conditioner that goes with this product yet, but the shampoo smells divine, and my hair feels incredibly soft after each use...</li>

<li> That seems odd to me.</li>
<li> Conditioners alone often make it limp</li>
<li> I had used this shampoo for the past year or so and was bummed when they changed the formula and along with it the packaging to the black bottle style.</li>
<li> but it in the store where it was extremely exspensive for a little bottle!!!</li>
<li> I have used this shampoo in the past and cannot find it anywhere else lately.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried every expensive shampoo out there, and they all dry my hair out.  </li>
<li> I was getting pretty frustrated that it&#x27;s difficult to find this product in Boston</li>

    <li> Catwalk Oatmeal &amp; Honey Shampoo is gentle (yet cleansing) for color treated hair. Pleasing fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have fine, wavy but flat on top hair; basically it is impossible. This shampoo works wonders. Really cleans but does not leave my hair weighed down. Oh and did I mention it is the best smelling shampoo in the entire world.</li>
    <li> I used this product for years and loved it because it moisturized my beard very well. They changed the formula and now it&#x27;s not any better than lesser expensive products.</li>
    <li> I have looked every where for this product. when I found it I purchased it.  I got it quickly and it wasa just what I was looking for .  Thank you</li>
    <li> Just like I remember!  I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner when I wash my hair with this.  Leaves my SEVERELY bleach/colortreated hair soft and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that has a luxurious feel to it.  Your hair will get squeaky clean, and it doubles as a great body wash, too.  The scent is great, as well.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair look great.  I like it with the conditioner too.  It is long lasting and a value for the money.</li>
    <li> Really love the performance of this shampoo!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend unfortunately refuses to use another shampoo (read: tries to save the shampoo resulting in less frequent washing). I was getting pretty frustrated that it&#x27;s difficult to find this product in Boston so decided to check out Amazon.   The bottle comes well packaged and had not leaked. There is a lot of shampoo--enough to last several months even if you have long hair. It smells DELICIOUS and leaves your hair feeling clean and not stripped. I certainly don&#x27;t hesitate to use his shampoo when I&#x27;m over at his and I&#x27;m quite particular about the products that I use. Good value for money as this isn&#x27;t a cheap shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!!!!! I use to buy it at a hair place then they stopped selling it so I had to but it in the store where it was extremely exspensive for a little bottle!!! It is the only shampoo and condishener that would work for my hair that wouldn&#x27;t make it feel greasy!!! I don&#x27;t have as much slit ends as I use to :)</li>
    <li> My daughter &amp; I love the smell of this shampoo and I get it every year for Christmas. I like the way they shipped it-they took the time to securely tape the dispenser so it wouldn&#x27;t spill shampoo during shipment</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, everyone in the house likes it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even receive shampoo.  I received some kind of body wash, and it leaked all over the packaging because the pump wasn&#x27;t taped down.  The body wash had a catwalk oatmeal and honey label on it, but it was the wrong product!!!!</li>
    <li> Great smell and allergy friendly!</li>
    <li> I started using this shampoo 15 years ago when I started to color my hair. It was the only one I tried that kept it healthy, full of body but still smooth and shiny, and it smells fantastic! I don&#x27;t color my hair anymore but it still does a better job than other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo, I have gray hair and it works great for me.  This was a great value compared to other sites I have looked at.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely AMAZING!!!  I haven&#x27;t tried the conditioner that goes with this product yet, but the shampoo smells divine, and my hair feels incredibly soft after each use...</li>
    <li> Smells just like an oatmeal cookie! My favorite shampoo! Does awesome on dry hair!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo/conditioner because I blow dry and straighten my hair and it&#x27;s pretty damaged. This shampoo/conditioner makes my hair unbelievably dry. Tried it out for two weeks and the dryness is even worse. Switching back to my old shampoo/conditioner!</li>
    <li> Do not use this if you have Asthma. The fragrance is so overpowering - it stays in even after using a clarifying shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  Smells so good.  Hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.</li>
    <li> It gets 5 stars because it is a great product but it is interesting that it has neither honey nor oatmeal in it.  That seems odd to me.</li>
    <li> I loved the smell of this shampoo, I started using it a year ago , then the place I bought it from quit selling it.  The shampoo I recieved has no odor. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo in the past and cannot find it anywhere else lately.  I like it very much because it does not have too much conditioner but makes my hair feel more healthy.  Conditioners alone often make it limp so this is perfect.</li>
    <li> I had used this shampoo for the past year or so and was bummed when they changed the formula and along with it the packaging to the black bottle style. I saw this and the old ingredients listed and was super excited so I ordered 4 bottles to stock up. It arrived and at first glance they appeared to be the original style bottles. When I went to wash my hair I instantly noticed the difference. The original formula was gentle and just foamed a bit but this stuff frothed up like mad and the smell seemed kind of obnoxious instead of pleasant. I looked at the ingredients listed on the bottle and they don&#x27;t vaguely match the original formula. I took a photo of the ingredients to show how different they are, although you probably can&#x27;t read them all due to the curved bottle. I am returning all four bottles as it is not something I would consider paying this much for, or using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original formula that left my hair feeling great and deserves five stars (same as ingredients in product listing above):&lt;br /&gt;Disodium Oleamido PEG-2, Sulfosuccinate, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Cucumis Sativus (Cucmber) Fruit Extract, Actinidia Chinesis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Coriandrum Sativum (Coriander) Extract, Jasminum Officinale (Jasmine) Extract, Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) Flower Extract, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Parfum (Fragrance), Cocos nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Gardenia Tahitensis Flower, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Juniperus Communis Fruit Extract, Cananga Odorata Flower Extract, Aleurites Moluccana Seed Oil, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Polyquaternium-11, Retinyl Palmitat, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Citric Acid, Benzyl Benzoate, Coumarin, Eugenol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12/3/14&lt;br /&gt;I returned the four bottles from the first vendor and purchased from a different Amazon prime vendor and got the bottles with the correct ingredients. Check your bottles when they arrive. They may appear similar to the listing, but the stuff inside which is what you are really paying for, may be completely different.what you are really paying for, may be completely different.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 4 years. Have tried a few others, but find this is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I used this product previously, but recently have had difficulty finding it locally.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon!  My hair feels soft, is managable, fragrant and healthy with &#x27;Oatmeal and Honey&#x27; shampoo!  I also use it to bathe our dog, and it keeps his fur soft and clean smelling.  In addition, it keeps his skin from getting too dry and itchy.</li>
    <li> I have dry hair and live in an arid climate.  I&#x27;ve tried every expensive shampoo out there, and they all dry my hair out.  This is the ONLY shampoo I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair.  I keep trying other ones that cost 2x-3x as much (why the heck do I do that?) but always regret it and come back to this one.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it, but it works to keep my hair smooth, frizless, bouncy, and shiny!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo (with the matching conditioner) ever, and I&#x27;ve tried them ALL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great on my long, thick, coarse, naturally curly, color treated hair. It cleans really well but doesn&#x27;t strip my hair or make it dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very sweet and natural, food-like, which my spouse really likes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle arrived full and not damaged or leaking in any way.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great for all ages. It gives my hair plenty of body, a clean shiny sheen. I haven&#x27;t had split ends in years.</li>
    <li> I ordered SHAMPOO and received conditioner. So instead of shampoo and conditioner I got two conditioners. Not what I wanted. I&#x27;m just dealing.</li>
    <li> This is the best product.  I hope they continue to make this product.  I bought 3 bottles and I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this shampoo as it is gentle. It works well with fine, silver hair. A bit fly away, but that&#x27;s what conditioner is for.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo for color treated hair!  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  It can be hard to find, but it&#x27;s worth the search!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo works wonder on colored/perm hair. leaves your hair soft and bouncy. works great on all hair types</li>
    <li> Still haven&#x27;t received my pocket survival.  All other orders are good, except the bamboo pet.  It was torn apart the first time my dog got ahold  of It  Bought one a couple of yrs ago and it lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> I just love the smell of this shampoo!  It does a good job washing my hair without leaving it too dry or too limp but the main reason I love this shampoo is the smell.  It just starts my whole day out right.</li>
    <li> I love the Catwalk shampoo and the conditioner too! They are a great combo for clean hair! I have curly hair and it works great for me. The oatmeal and honey has a light scent that smells great too.</li>
