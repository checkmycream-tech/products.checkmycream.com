### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is a very good hair dye.</li>
      <li>Beautiful, beautiful color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was a beautiful color, but not what my intention was.</li>
      <li>but still great either way.</li>
      <li>I did however see a very nice color when I used it with conditioner.</li>
      <li>The color is awesome, though would be better on bleached hair than on non.</li>
      <li>Now, to be fair, I have never tried this color out so</li>
      <li>Special Effects hair dye is just wonderful, and that includes this color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great color, and it sticks around A LOT longer than most green-tint dyes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>and it has always been the absolute best hairdye, ever.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually nice having both colors and when it comes out turquoise</li>
      <li>I neglected the color (hoping for fade) and it stayed very strong for the</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a really great hairdye; it&#x27;s long-lasting (for what it is: no semipermanent stays around a good while), the colors are rich and have a good fade (they don&#x27;t tend to be murky and bland while fading out, just softer and muted), and my hair feels great and is shiny and healthy-looking post-process.</li>
      <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
      <li>This is my all-time favorite hair dye.</li>
      <li>Love the color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a really lovely color.</li>
      <li>However the pigment is so potent that even with a 50/50 mixture I got a very true fishbowl</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using special effects for many many years now</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s super vibrant and beautiful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also easy to dye over</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fairly light.</li>
      <li>Fish Bowl gives a true, bright turquoise color to very light blonde (level 10) hair.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this wonderful blue-green color, it reminds me of blue cotton candy and makes me smile with good memories of eating the sugary stuff when I was little.</li>
      <li>The color is perfect at first, but within a week the roots fade due to heat from my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This dye works better than Manic Panic because it comes out exactly like it promises it will.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Special Effects since I was a teenager</li>
      <li>dye, along with \\&quot;Iguana Green\\&quot; by Special Effects, made me into a fan after swearing by Manic Panic for 7 years.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>Word to the wise, though: If you plan to dye your hair with Special Effects and do periodic upkeep on the color, purchase several bottles at once.</li>
      <li>Word to the wise, unless your hair is platinum blonde</li>
      <li>all of the colors came out vivid and beautiful EXCEPT for the fishbowl.... where blue should have been</li>
      <li>I bleach my naturally dark brown hair to a light blonde, and then used a toner over it before applying this dye for the best result.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I use Special Effects.</li>
      <li>and i have to admit fishbowl has been my favorite so far.</li>
      <li>gave it 4 out of 5 stars, because it is a beautiful and staining color, but it does fade to a very green tinted aqua if neglected and upkempt.</li>
      <li>Special effects is without question the best weird coloured hair dye.</li>
      <li>Will stain shower if you don&#x27;t wash it out right away.</li>
      <li>First application of this it faded pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s VERY intense, and will stain everything (bleach and rubbing alcohol are your friends).</li>
      <li>If I can get the color right with the conditioner after my first attempt fades out, I will most definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
      <li>That being said, if there is a tint, it really is a pretty color as well.</li>
      <li>The bottle suggests that it&#x27;s more of a blue shade, so if you are going for that this probably isn&#x27;t the color you want to try.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall, I love the color, it&#x27;s just what I always wanted.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>Worked much better and stayed a lot longer on the second application.</li>
      <li>Long lasting color and great selection.</li>
      <li>Yellower blonde hair will appear more green but it is still a nice color.</li>
      <li>The seller was perfectly fine (which is the only reason I&#x27;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1)</li>
      <li>I purchased fishbowl with the intention of mixing it with conditioner to a much lighter aqua mermaid color.</li>
      <li>I recommend mixing this with hair conditioner to really extend the life of this product since it&#x27;s so concentrated.</li>
      <li>I absolutely recommend this color.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t have it both ways though, it either lasts and lasts or it doesn&#x27;t and doesn&#x27;t bleed much.</li>
      <li>but when I dyed my hair three tones (virgin rose, sonic green and fishbowl)</li>
      <li>It came out a vibrant blue and made some purple where it hit the previous special effects (virgin rose)</li>
      <li>The colours are vivid the first time you dye it.</li>
      <li>It fades away slowly with each washing into a lighter beautiful colour, For example blue fades to purple.</li>
      <li>Reordered it and another blue from special effects.</li>
      <li>(well I dyed over with the blue velvet special effects dye, and it&#x27;s darker).&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has more undertones of green than the picture appears to be.</li>
      <li>I tried multiple times, at first thinking</li>
      <li>Make sure to get as much of the yellow and orange out of your hair, as to keep the green tint out.</li>
      <li>I tried 4 other brands before finding this Special Effects.  </li>
      <li>The folks who make it only do so a couple times a year, so you will have to go on a hunt for it at certain times if you need it year-round.</li>
      <li>To get the best result you should definitely bleach your hair first then dye it because fishbowl is not a *dominant* color(like dark blue or dark green)</li>
      <li>Overall I really like this hair dye</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s going to be more of a sea green color rather than blue.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s bluish green and looks amazing on bleach blonde hair, it really reminds me of mermaids and children&#x27;s books i used to read when i was little.</li>
      <li>I dye every two to three months and Special Effects doesn&#x27;t destroy my hair.</li>
      <li>This definitely doesn&#x27;t last as long as their Atomic Pink, but it is still one of the longest lasting blues I&#x27;ve been able to find.</li>
      <li>far as blue goes, it lasted the longest out of all the brands I tried, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the fading.</li>
      <li>Bleeds very little when washing but fades fairly quickly, especially for Special Effects, hence the three-star rating.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Special Effects lasts so long that I end up dying my roots with the old color still in it, though it will ultimately be somewhat faded.</li>

<li> Because it simply lasts the longest, it blows all the other brand away.</li>

<li> Lasts longer than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
<li> After a few days it kinda went from a dark turquoise to green.</li>
<li> wish colour shampoo and conditioning masks while washing with only cold water, I can get this dye to last over 8 weeks before I want a touch up!</li>
<li> Starts to turn a bit green after a while for me...</li>
<li> Just save yourself the trouble and stock up.&lt;br</li>
<li> The formula was quite thick for my experience.</li>
<li> but it doesn&#x27;t look as bad as other green&#x27;s Iv&#x27;e seen before.</li>
<li> You might say, the fish bowl is a little dirty.</li>
<li> and frankly it&#x27;s so useless</li>
<li> I had dirty bleach....</li>
<li> and I got the wrong color!</li>
<li> but I think I may have received a bad batch of dye...</li>
<li> It washes out almost immediately :-(</li>
<li> it has to go to the trash. :(</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed because it took 11 days to get here</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The dye lasts FOREVER! (Just kidding, but it does last a very long time - I had it in my hair for over 2 months and it still showed! It&#x27;s also easy to dye over (well I dyed over with the blue velvet special effects dye, and it&#x27;s darker).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came out in both shades of blue (turquoisy) and sea green - think Mermaid! It&#x27;s actually nice having both colors and when it comes out turquoise it&#x27;s super vibrant and beautiful.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this wonderful blue-green color, it reminds me of blue cotton candy and makes me smile with good memories of eating the sugary stuff when I was little. This dye works better than Manic Panic because it comes out exactly like it promises it will. The color is awesome, though would be better on bleached hair than on non. However, this will stain your bathtub, especially if you have an acrylic tub liner (like what bath-fitter puts in). I didn&#x27;t mess mine up too bad, just a few tiny droplets on the floor of the tub that will come out with soap and hot water, but its a lot better to just avoid the whole mess by probably laying down plastic or something in case of stray drops of dye. Overall, I love the color, it&#x27;s just what I always wanted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using special effects for many many years now and i have to admit fishbowl has been my favorite so far. It&#x27;s bluish green and looks amazing on bleach blonde hair, it really reminds me of mermaids and children&#x27;s books i used to read when i was little. It gets lighter and lighter with every wash unlike other hair dyes where you wash your hair once and the color&#x27;s gone. To get the best result you should definitely bleach your hair first then dye it because fishbowl is not a *dominant* color(like dark blue or dark green) it&#x27;s fairly light. Also, it doesn&#x27;t stain your skin like dark colors do.I absolutely recommend this color.</li>
    <li> Lasts longer than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried! It&#x27;s in my hair as I write this. &#x3D;)  Starts to turn a bit green after a while for me...but still great either way. Fades quicker than some of the other colors I have used from this brand..but like I said, still lasts longer than OTHER brands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two years now to dye my hair a medium shade of teal. The bottle suggests that it&#x27;s more of a blue shade, so if you are going for that this probably isn&#x27;t the color you want to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a really lovely color. I bleach my naturally dark brown hair to a light blonde, and then used a toner over it before applying this dye for the best result.</li>
    <li> The seller was perfectly fine (which is the only reason I&#x27;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1) but I think I may have received a bad batch of dye... I&#x27;ve been using Special Effects since I was a teenager and it has always been the absolute best hairdye, ever. Long lasting color and great selection. Now, to be fair, I have never tried this color out so may it&#x27;s just this specific color but when I dyed my hair three tones (virgin rose, sonic green and fishbowl) all of the colors came out vivid and beautiful EXCEPT for the fishbowl.... where blue should have been I had dirty bleach.... I tried multiple times, at first thinking maybe I just hadn&#x27;t coated it enough but nope, no blue!!! I won&#x27;t buy this one again and frankly it&#x27;s so useless it has to go to the trash. :(</li>
    <li> Special Effects hair dye is just wonderful, and that includes this color.

    <li> It has more undertones of green than the picture appears to be. You might say, the fish bowl is a little dirty. ;)</li>
    <li> This definitely doesn&#x27;t last as long as their Atomic Pink, but it is still one of the longest lasting blues I&#x27;ve been able to find. Word to the wise, unless your hair is platinum blonde it&#x27;s going to be more of a sea green color rather than blue. Overall I really like this hair dye and I&#x27;d probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> Special effects is without question the best weird coloured hair dye. Because it simply lasts the longest, it blows all the other brand away. The colours are vivid the first time you dye it. It fades away slowly with each washing into a lighter beautiful colour, For example blue fades to purple. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m getting two colours for one dye job. I love it! wish colour shampoo and conditioning masks while washing with only cold water, I can get this dye to last over 8 weeks before I want a touch up!</li>
    <li> First application of this it faded pretty quickly. Reordered it and another blue from special effects. Worked much better and stayed a lot longer on the second application. Love the color. Will stain shower if you don&#x27;t wash it out right away.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I use Special Effects. I might have overestimated all the reviews I read before purchasing. I did like the color but it was not at all what I was expecting. The formula was quite thick for my experience. I did however see a very nice color when I used it with conditioner. (Some people recommended I do that next time). After a few days it kinda went from a dark turquoise to green. I don&#x27;t really like the green but it doesn&#x27;t look as bad as other green&#x27;s Iv&#x27;e seen before. What I can say is that this stuff doesn&#x27;t stain as much as other dye&#x27;s I have used before. I still have about half the bottle left. If I can get the color right with the conditioner after my first attempt fades out, I will most definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, beautiful color. Make sure to get as much of the yellow and orange out of your hair, as to keep the green tint out. That being said, if there is a tint, it really is a pretty color as well.</li>

    <li> Word to the wise, though: If you plan to dye your hair with Special Effects and do periodic upkeep on the color, purchase several bottles at once. The folks who make it only do so a couple times a year, so you will have to go on a hunt for it at certain times if you need it year-round. Just save yourself the trouble and stock up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a really great hairdye; it&#x27;s long-lasting (for what it is: no semipermanent stays around a good while), the colors are rich and have a good fade (they don&#x27;t tend to be murky and bland while fading out, just softer and muted), and my hair feels great and is shiny and healthy-looking post-process. I dye every two to three months and Special Effects doesn&#x27;t destroy my hair.</li>
    <li> Fish Bowl gives a true, bright turquoise color to very light blonde (level 10) hair. Yellower blonde hair will appear more green but it is still a nice color. Bleeds very little when washing but fades fairly quickly, especially for Special Effects, hence the three-star rating.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed because it took 11 days to get here and I got the wrong color!</li>
