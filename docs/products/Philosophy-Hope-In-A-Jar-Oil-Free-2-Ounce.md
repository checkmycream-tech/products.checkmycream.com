### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best face lotion I&#x27;ve used on the market.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist advised products without oil and this one is perfect.  </li>
      <li>perfect transaction!  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s always GREAT.  </li>
      <li>When Oil of Olay discontinued their oil-free lotion, I moved to this lotion by Philosophy and am so happy I made the switch.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and looks great under makeup.</li>
      <li>Great purchase....</li>
      <li>Love it and good price.</li>
      <li>I got a sample of this moisturizer from Beauty.com and absolutely loved it, smelled great, soaked in fast and gave me a smoother better skin.  </li>
      <li>It was very light and non-greasy.</li>
      <li>I stocked up on many of these as it appears Sephora no longer carries it.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>and we both love this lotion.</li>
      <li>Love all their products -</li>
      <li>And would cost much more than the cream itself...</li>
      <li>It has a nice light feel.  </li>
      <li>I love this cream because it moisterizes without my face becoming greasy.</li>
      <li>After shopping around a lot and looking for the best price, holy cow</li>
      <li>The strong mildew smell is repulsive and when I get a whiff of it throughout the day it makes me wonder if people around me can smell it as well.  </li>
      <li>So buy quickly!  </li>
      <li>This is supposed to be an oil free moisturizer</li>
      <li>Thanks for carrying this!  :)</li>
      <li>Even though this is oil free, I feel like my face gets oily quick.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d heard really good reviews of this product and had actually used it before - turns out the formula I had was Hope Oil Free SPF 15 -</li>
      <li>It is by far my favorite skin product!</li>
      <li>Smells good, does not clog my pores, and facial lines have improved since using it.</li>
      <li>I was introduced to philosphy by purity made simple one step cleanser and loved it, since my skin is oily</li>
      <li>The fragrance does not bother me at all and dissipates quickly.  </li>
      <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
      <li>I love this product as it is paraben free while Philosphy&#x27;s regular hope in a jar is not!</li>
      <li>I love all Philosophy products and was a big fan of &amp;#34;Never</li>
      <li>but it makes my face very oily!  </li>
      <li>Absorbed well into my skin and made it super soft.</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite facial moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I guess I must be allergic to it without the SPF because after use my face turned splotchy and became very sensitive.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I have very oily skin.</li>
      <li>I used regular Hope in a Jar all winter, but got oil free for the summer.</li>
      <li>much to my surprise</li>
      <li>It is super lightweight and it doesn&#x27;t cause me to have as much shine on my face, especially during the humid, sweaty summer months.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hands down my favorite lotion.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it along with the purity cleanser.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone with oily and breakout prone skin.</li>
      <li>I also use the oil-free with SPF version and it&#x27;s a little heavier but still comfortable during the hot weather.</li>
      <li>Apparently is a new formula..</li>
      <li>Not that i can do it since i live in colombia..</li>
      <li>I really like Philosophy products but will definitely purchase from a direct site in the future as I question the validity of this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It did hydrate well, but the bright red spots it caused were far worse than dry skin!</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this is the only moisturizer that actually moisturizes my skin without making me break out.</li>
      <li>Apparently I purchased the wrong product because I was looking for the same with SPF, which I love.</li>

<li> Apparently I purchased the wrong product because I was looking for the same with SPF, which I love.</li>

<li> Its got a typical plain fragrance free lotion smell that goes away once dry.</li>
<li> and the smell is like an old bath towel my son leaves in his bathroom on the floor after a few days.  </li>
<li> i wanted to complement my skin care routine with the oil free moisturizer, BIG mistake, only after i felt the product burning and smelling bad on my skin</li>
<li> AND it&#x27;s small enough for carry-on travel, but lasts long.</li>
<li> It lasts forever because you only need to use a small amount.  </li>
<li> As the other reviewer said..</li>
<li> This lotion is okay, is thinner than what I&#x27;m used to, but the lotion smell is really unpleasant!</li>
<li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the lotion or a change in my skin.</li>
<li> , wich is weird because my skin is not sensitive at all..</li>
<li> everyone complained about it..</li>
<li> It&#x27;s MUCH less expensive on Amazon than in department stores.</li>
<li> Let Them See You Shine&amp;#34; face wash and was so sad when they discontinued it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews about the smell being horrible</li>
<li> you can&#x27;t go wrong!  </li>
<li> Too bad they discontinued this.</li>
<li> That smells and looks bad but also burns like a peeling cream..</li>
<li> this stuff is expensive, I purchased off Amazon and am totally disgusted with the smell.  </li>
<li> UPDATE - Philosophy has discontinued this item :-(</li>
<li> Although the smell is horrible</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My husband uses this product, he has oily skin and whenever he begins to get low he always lets me know so we can reorder.</li>
    <li> Too bad they discontinued this. It&#x27;s hands down my favorite lotion.</li>
    <li> Great purchase....perfect transaction!  Would use this seller again in a heart beat!!! Saved a lot of $$$$</li>
    <li> It is super lightweight and it doesn&#x27;t cause me to have as much shine on my face, especially during the humid, sweaty summer months.</li>
    <li> UPDATE - Philosophy has discontinued this item :-( So buy quickly!  Smells good, does not clog my pores, and facial lines have improved since using it. I love all Philosophy products and was a big fan of &amp;#34;Never Let Them See You Shine&amp;#34; face wash and was so sad when they discontinued it. I only wish they made an oil-free lotion earlier. When Oil of Olay discontinued their oil-free lotion, I moved to this lotion by Philosophy and am so happy I made the switch. Best face lotion I&#x27;ve used on the market. Totally worth the money. AND it&#x27;s small enough for carry-on travel, but lasts long. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to philosphy by purity made simple one step cleanser and loved it, since my skin is oily i wanted to complement my skin care routine with the oil free moisturizer, BIG mistake, only after i felt the product burning and smelling bad on my skin i read the reviews on the philosophy site because maybe i was having an alergic reaction, wich is weird because my skin is not sensitive at all.. much to my surprise everyone complained about it.. Apparently is a new formula.. That smells and looks bad but also burns like a peeling cream.. As the other reviewer said.. Philosophy wont do anything because it was bought on amazon and seller wont accept returns... Not that i can do it since i live in colombia.. And would cost much more than the cream itself... so yeah.. wasted almost 50 dollars (with international shipping) on a very nice and foreign tube of useless cream.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be an oil free moisturizer but it makes my face very oily!  The seller will not accept my return after having it a week and Philosophy will not do anything about it because it is bought from Amazon.  So I paid $32 for a stinky face cream that makes me oily.</li>
    <li> Apparently I purchased the wrong product because I was looking for the same with SPF, which I love. This lotion is okay, is thinner than what I&#x27;m used to, but the lotion smell is really unpleasant! Thank goodness I only purchased one tube! I&#x27;ll look for something else in the future.</li>
    <li> It was very light and non-greasy. Absorbed well into my skin and made it super soft. I&#x27;ve read other reviews about the smell being horrible but I didn&#x27;t fund that to be the case. Its got a typical plain fragrance free lotion smell that goes away once dry. I have been using this about two weeks now and my skin is improving.</li>
    <li> I love this product as it is paraben free while Philosphy&#x27;s regular hope in a jar is not! I stocked up on many of these as it appears Sephora no longer carries it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Philosophy - it&#x27;s always GREAT.  Love all their products - you can&#x27;t go wrong!  Thanks for carrying this!  :)</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this moisturizer from Beauty.com and absolutely loved it, smelled great, soaked in fast and gave me a smoother better skin.  After shopping around a lot and looking for the best price, holy cow this stuff is expensive, I purchased off Amazon and am totally disgusted with the smell.  The product seems a bit thicker coming out of the tube but still soaks in well and the smell is like an old bath towel my son leaves in his bathroom on the floor after a few days.  The strong mildew smell is repulsive and when I get a whiff of it throughout the day it makes me wonder if people around me can smell it as well.  I really like Philosophy products but will definitely purchase from a direct site in the future as I question the validity of this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My dermatologist advised products without oil and this one is perfect.  I use this at night and the SPF 30 version during the day.  The fragrance does not bother me at all and dissipates quickly.  It has a nice light feel.  I highly recommend this to anyone with oily and breakout prone skin.</li>
    <li> I have combination/dry skin and my sister has combination/oily skin and we both love this lotion. It&#x27;s lightweight and looks great under makeup.</li>
    <li> Even though this is oil free, I feel like my face gets oily quick. Not sure if it&#x27;s the lotion or a change in my skin.</li>
    <li> Love it and good price.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  It lasts forever because you only need to use a small amount.  It is by far my favorite skin product!</li>
    <li> I am 63 y/o and I have very oily skin. This moisturizer gives moisture to my skin w/o the oiliness.</li>
    <li> I used regular Hope in a Jar all winter, but got oil free for the summer. Although the smell is horrible I love this cream because it moisterizes without my face becoming greasy. I also use the oil-free with SPF version and it&#x27;s a little heavier but still comfortable during the hot weather.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite facial moisturizer. I have very sensitive skin, and this is the only moisturizer that actually moisturizes my skin without making me break out. I highly recommend it along with the purity cleanser. It&#x27;s MUCH less expensive on Amazon than in department stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d heard really good reviews of this product and had actually used it before - turns out the formula I had was Hope Oil Free SPF 15 - I guess I must be allergic to it without the SPF because after use my face turned splotchy and became very sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did hydrate well, but the bright red spots it caused were far worse than dry skin!</li>
