      <li>The best instant temporary tanning spray product I&#x27;ve tried...</li>
      <li>It really works well, and gives a GREAT color.</li>
      <li>The product was very easy to use, and rub into the skin easily.</li>
      <li>It stays on pretty good even with sweat.</li>
      <li>It is the best way to smooth out your skin in low cut tops or to freshen up your legs in shorts or a skirt.&lt;br /&gt;It is so easy to use...</li>
      <li>However, it does washes off clothes quite easily.</li>
      <li>Great product, best fake tan in a can</li>
      <li>Easy to use and won&#x27;t turn you orange.  </li>
      <li>Easy to work with.</li>
      <li>just spray on and smooth over to even it all out.</li>
      <li>, then use your hands to smooth and even out the color.  </li>
      <li>Great to wear as a daily bronzer or an all over tanner for the day.</li>
      <li>Like i put 3 layers of foundation on, even when I evenly distributed it lightly over my skin.  </li>
      <li>I love this product because it gives the skin just the right glow with just a touch of shimmer.</li>
      <li>Beautiful bronze color you can make as light or dark as you want.  </li>
      <li>I am very fair skinned and this product is very dark.  </li>
      <li>Its hard to find sometimes, but this is the BEST temp tan ever made!</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and evenly and stays on really well.  </li>
      <li>Adds just a little shimmer to your skin and a great tropical scent.</li>
      <li>amazon made it available and the shipping time was fast.</li>
      <li>Ok, let me be clear about this product.</li>
      <li>Make sure to spray this from far away: or have someone do it for you</li>
      <li>Not a dark dark color but a beautiful glistening bronze color, a beatiful shimmer look to it</li>
      <li>Perfect for any last minute outing when you need a little bronzing!</li>
      <li>It also lasts a bit even after taking a shower (it does come off and is NOT a self tanner), but for some reason it does stay on pretty darn</li>
      <li>It washes off (well most of it anyways), so yes, it will come off on your clothes (Don&#x27;t wear white!).</li>
      <li>Make sure to use it over a dark towel since excess spray can land on light surfaces and discolor them.</li>
      <li>Only lasts a day or two, but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
      <li>This is a product that is frequently used (and loved) by professional competitive Latin/Ballroom dancers to achieve a deep tanned look under spot lights.</li>
      <li>finally found a product that tan easy and doesn&#x27;t smell&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>I think anyone who could use this would have to already be very suntanned.  </li>
      <li>I really hope they don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>This product is nice for a fast tan that you can wash off when your ready, it doesnt look orange or slowly fade away with spots...</li>
      <li>But I highly highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Applies very evenly and looks natural.</li>
      <li>The color is just a nice deep dark tan.</li>
      <li>The color is also nice and dark for Asian skintone people.  </li>
      <li>It gives you a natural looking tan.</li>
      <li>Natural looking tan.</li>
      <li>The only problem for me was that the product on my skin looked very cakey.</li>
      <li>First of all, this is more of a body makeup, and unlike the self-tanning lotions that contains DHA powders, it does not infuse into your stratum corneum (dead outter skin layer) to give you a slow developing tan that lasts 1-2 weeks.</li>

    <li> the  best  very  sexy</li>
    <li> This is the best wash-off tanner that I&#x27;ve found for the price.  If you don&#x27;t want to spend $60 or more this is your tanner.  I heard they were discontinuing this tanner- I really hope they don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and won&#x27;t turn you orange.  Adds just a little shimmer to your skin and a great tropical scent.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, does NOT come out orange in any way. The color is just a nice deep dark tan. It immediatley washes off your hands also. Great product, best fake tan in a can I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I am very fair skinned and this product is very dark.  I think anyone who could use this would have to already be very suntanned.  I didn&#x27;t see anywhere that it came in different tints but this didn&#x27;t work for me.  Don&#x27;t know what to do with it now - just wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I was watching a local TV show, and they were demonstrating this product. I decided to give it a try, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. It gives you a nice looking tan without looking orange.</li>
    <li> Ok, let me be clear about this product. First of all, this is more of a body makeup, and unlike the self-tanning lotions that contains DHA powders, it does not infuse into your stratum corneum (dead outter skin layer) to give you a slow developing tan that lasts 1-2 weeks.

It stays on pretty good even with sweat. Although if you are fair-skinned and dripping sweat, it probably will have visible streaks and make you look &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;. If you plan to heavily perspire, I recommend build a base tan with DHA powder containing product over a few days, then put this over it the day of your competition/performance. This product will even out your skin tone, and make your tan darker. With a &amp;#34;base&amp;#34;, even if you do sweat some of it off, it won&#x27;t be as noticeable.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It gives you a natural looking tan. Not orange.</li>
    <li> Natural looking tan. Easy to work with.</li>
    <li> Awesome product !&lt;br /&gt;I finally found a product that tan easy and doesn&#x27;t smell&lt;br /&gt;You can take if in your purse and spray anywhere</li>
    <li> Stumbled upon this product by way of a girlfriend. It really works well, and gives a GREAT color. I keep ordering as they are much more expensive in the salons. 5 Stars all the way!</li>
    <li> Great! Did not rub off once applied and looked great under the spotlight/on the stage. Great color without the orange.</li>
    <li> The best instant temporary tanning spray product I&#x27;ve tried... Great tan color, easy aerosol spray, dries quickly...I love this product!</li>
    <li> Great for a quick tan, easy to use, smells good. Washes off nightly.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it gives the skin just the right glow with just a touch of shimmer. It is the best way to smooth out your skin in low cut tops or to freshen up your legs in shorts or a skirt.&lt;br /&gt;It is so easy to use...just spray on and smooth over to even it all out. Doesn&#x27;t build up even if you spray too much.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for years but recently it was hard to find. Voila! amazon made it available and the shipping time was fast.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!! Used it on my wedding day. Only suggestion is to let it dry thoroughly. It does not get on your clothes</li>
    <li> Make sure to spray this from far away: or have someone do it for you</li>
    <li> I had purchased and used this years ago when the name was &amp;#34;Big Sexy&amp;#34;... then seemed to be impossible to find.  Great update to the original product.  I like a spray tan that you can SEE as you put it on, then use your hands to smooth and even out the color.  Beautiful bronze color you can make as light or dark as you want.  Always makes my legs look great.  Make sure to use it over a dark towel since excess spray can land on light surfaces and discolor them.</li>
    <li> HOLY BRONZE!!!  Only use if you want to look REALLY dark.  It is NOT NATURAL AT ALL!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually used this since 2002! Its hard to find sometimes, but this is the BEST temp tan ever made! It also lasts a bit even after taking a shower (it does come off and is NOT a self tanner), but for some reason it does stay on pretty darn well. I wish they made this in a lotion or gel! But I highly highly recommend. And the smell is lovely! A beachy coconut smell!</li>
    <li> My favorite! I swear by this!! Perfect for any last minute outing when you need a little bronzing! Spray in circular motion and in the shower!!</li>
    <li> This product is nice for a fast tan that you can wash off when your ready, it doesnt look orange or slowly fade away with spots... Not a dark dark color but a beautiful glistening bronze color, a beatiful shimmer look to it, someone asked me what i was doing to my skin to make it look so shiny &amp; healthy, its that nice :)</li>
    <li> Love, love this product!!! Great to wear as a daily bronzer or an all over tanner for the day. Great for body building and dance competitions! This is also a GREAT product to help even out a not so great spray or self tan.</li>
    <li> This tanning spray is great!! This spray get&#x27;s you really dark. It&#x27;s so dark that I don&#x27;t think I am gonna use it in the winter, going to  wait till at least the end of spring. One spray and you are instantly deeply tanned. I use my hands to apply because the color that it leaves on your hands will come off with some soap and water. This is not a self tanner so when you shower all the color is going to come off. I am going to continue to use self tanner and use this when I am going somewhere nice, like on vacation. After this spray dries on your skin it doesn&#x27;t budge. This stays put and I never had a problem with it coming off on my clothes. Will keep buying this!! I don&#x27;t think I would wear this if I was planning on swimming though.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Applies very evenly and looks natural.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST tanning spray product in the market!  It goes on easily and evenly and stays on really well.  The color is also nice and dark for Asian skintone people.  Other types/brands are too orangey shade.  I&#x27;ve tried every type of spray and lotion type tanning and found this is NUMBER 1 !  Wish they sold it in Honolulu, Hawaii so we could save on shipping costs.</li>
    <li> This stuff is EXCELLENT!!!! NO SMELL EITHER!!! Only lasts a day or two, but that&#x27;s OK. I&#x27;d buy it again and again!</li>
    <li> The product was very easy to use, and rub into the skin easily. The only problem for me was that the product on my skin looked very cakey. Like i put 3 layers of foundation on, even when I evenly distributed it lightly over my skin.  Other than that, I liked it.</li>
