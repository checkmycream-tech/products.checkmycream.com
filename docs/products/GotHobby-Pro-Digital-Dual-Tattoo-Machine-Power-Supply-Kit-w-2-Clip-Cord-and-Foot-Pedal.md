      <li>Recieved it before the estimated time, had all of its pieces,  and runs great, the only reason I Did not give it five stars is because I don&#x27;t know how it runs after a full day of use or long down the run, but this far it is great</li>

      <li>Hurricane, TEK, or monster point make the better and more expensive power supplies.</li>
      <li>My only complaint and why it receives 4 stars and not 5 is that power supply itself is very light, which makes me think its cheaply made....</li>
      <li>cause its new and shiny</li>
      <li>Its going in the trash as soon as I get my new one.</li>
      <li>The shader side stays full throttle, no matter how much you turn it down.</li>

      <li>It came a day early which was a benefit I took hold of thank</li>
      <li>Overall decent experience.</li>
      <li>I received my new power supply and wanted to try it out because I had heard mixed reviews, I did not have any tattoos lined up for the day</li>
      <li>Secondly, the foot pedal worked for about 15 minutes and then stopped working completely.</li>

<li> and it&#x27;s not very well built</li>
<li> I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because when I received it three items were missing.</li>
<li> Everything I expected</li>
<li> not worth my time or money buying</li>
<li> Power supply caught fire after a few minutes of use</li>
<li> Footpedal allows stuff to get inbetween contact and makes it hard to push</li>
<li> It was just a little disappointing getting the package without the parts.</li>
<li> but i found out after messing with it that i have to push the cord real hard in and hold it</li>

    <li> Awesome quality back. I love cords strong and long enough to get job done. Hassle free good shipping times.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, super fast shipping, great power supply &amp; foot pedal. Not impressed with the quality of clip cords, but to get all of this for the price more than made up for it.</li>
    <li> Ordered this and received it 5 days earlier then stated through amazon.  Came nicely packaged with all items as said in description.  I have used it 2x for approx. 5 hrs and it hasn&#x27;t had any issues with fluctuating voltage or shut offs.  The pedal is light and easy to push down, clear connection.  My only complaint and why it receives 4 stars and not 5 is that power supply itself is very light, which makes me think its cheaply made....you get what you pay for, and I don&#x27;t think its been used long enough to see if it truly will last through a long tattoo session.  So for the price and fast delivery its great.  Hurricane, TEK, or monster point make the better and more expensive power supplies.</li>
    <li> This was part of a kit ordered for my son and it was well received. Great quality product.</li>
    <li> The female liner jack quit working.</li>
    <li> nice power supply - works very well</li>
    <li> Works great. No problems.</li>
    <li> I love it. It came a day early which was a benefit I took hold of thank u.</li>
    <li> Works geat for the price</li>
    <li> Product was packaged great. Worked like a charm when I connected my machine to it. Great voltage and everything.</li>
    <li> it was nice it serves its purpose</li>
    <li> We are very pleased with what we have ordered thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> Recieved it before the estimated time, had all of its pieces,  and runs great, the only reason I Did not give it five stars is because I don&#x27;t know how it runs after a full day of use or long down the run, but this far it is great</li>
    <li> got this item today took it out of the box set it up to find out it didnt work. the seller said try the outlet so i used it on 2 others and it would not work, then the seller says its the cord. but i found out after messing with it that i have to push the cord real hard in and hold it or else it just cuts off. not worth my time or money buying</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an OKAY power supply not the best colts will jump a lot and it&#x27;s not very well built but it&#x27;ll get the job done</li>
    <li> I received my new power supply and wanted to try it out because I had heard mixed reviews, I did not have any tattoos lined up for the day so I used it while showing my daughter techniques on the practice skins. My old power supply would start cutting out after an hour, this power supply kept going strong. I will definitely be buying another one as a gift for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Overall decent experience. And quick delivery. My only complaints were that firstly a tracking number wasn&#x27;t provided. Secondly, the foot pedal worked for about 15 minutes and then stopped working completely.</li>
    <li> Been using for about a month or so no issues thus far works great I like that you can hook up two machines at the sametime because I use two different tattoo guns when I do tattoos I use one for linings and other for shading awesome</li>
    <li> Ne and my dad are both tattoo artist and our new power supplies are a life saver I never owned a machine so precise and smooth it doesn&#x27;t cause my hand to go to sleep or cramp up and my dad is happy cause its new and shiny</li>
    <li> Just as described and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Works great! Everything I expected</li>
    <li> Only the liner side of mine works. The shader side stays full throttle, no matter how much you turn it down. Its going in the trash as soon as I get my new one.</li>
    <li> The power supply works great. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the foot peddle has to have foot contact the whole time. you cant just click it on and off.</li>
    <li> It works well but I have to keep adjusting it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great , easy to use and to install.</li>
    <li> Works great recommending to buy</li>
    <li> This item works great! I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because when I received it three items were missing. The foot pedal, both clip cords and the cord to power the power source. I contacted the company and they did send me the missing items plus a refund for the clip cord they no long had in stock. Overall, the machine works great! It was just a little disappointing getting the package without the parts.</li>
    <li> Footpedal allows stuff to get inbetween contact and makes it hard to push</li>
    <li> Works perfectly thank you</li>
    <li> This came in the mail very fast and works great so far. I have only used a few times and has worked great. It came with all of the items it said. I would recommend it for the price.</li>
    <li> Power supply caught fire after a few minutes of use</li>
