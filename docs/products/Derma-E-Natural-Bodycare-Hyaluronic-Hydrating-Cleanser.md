      <li>Great stuff for cleaning your face.  </li>

      <li>So far so good !</li>
      <li>I was SO excited!  </li>
      <li>I ordered the product and got to my place before expected and works wonderful.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just strong.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not terrible and goes away quickly after you rinse...</li>
      <li>Great company but this product made my eyes burn and left a soapy feeling on my face.</li>
      <li>THEY SMELL GREAT AND ARE VERY GENTLE ON MY VERY SENSITIVE SKIN.  </li>
      <li>Works easily and quickly</li>
      <li>This cleanser is really gently on my dry skin but works great.  </li>
      <li>I use it at night to clean my face, with lots of water.</li>
      <li>It has a lovely, light plumeria scent and is very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Hydration is nothing special, just so</li>
      <li>I also love the scent of this product so much that I bought the night cream</li>
      <li>Actually, this product is darn good</li>
      <li>which is why I really like this product, but I don&#x27;t really enjoy the strong fragrance.</li>
      <li>I found this to be a great mild cleanser which has replaced the Neutrogena Extra Gentle Cleanser that I used for years.  </li>
      <li>It really worked great on my  dry , flaky skin.</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive skin, and the Very Clear&#x27;s new formula really burns my skin (though it&#x27;s still great for more oily skin --</li>
      <li>but it wasn&#x27;t fun.  </li>
      <li>This cleanser doesn&#x27;t take much to Suds up and makes your face feel clean the first wash!</li>
      <li>The scent is pretty light and pleasant and overall as a product it has potential for people that don&#x27;t have really reactive skin like I do.</li>
      <li>Like this product very much.</li>
      <li>I like how it foams but not too much, has a fresh scent and seem to remove my make up well..</li>
      <li>I love the smell and feel of this facial cleanser.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not my first time buying this</li>
      <li>It is not perfect and flawless, but I don&#x27;t think anybody would notice my rosacea anymore.  </li>
      <li>From the first wash on, the stinging was gone.  </li>
      <li>I decided to try this product because all of the Cerave products didn&#x27;t work for me, and I was still interested in trying hyaluronic acid in skincare products.</li>
      <li>It cleans well, smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dried out.</li>
      <li>I have mostly oily skin with some dry patches (combination, on the oily side).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit more expensive for me (a whole dollar right now!), but definitely worth it if your skin is a bit more sensitive.</li>
      <li>Product shipped fast.</li>
      <li>Very pricey for the quality of cleanser.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s my skins reaction and has absolutely nothing to do with the quality of the product.</li>
      <li>I have even used it with my Clarisonic machine and that works very well.</li>
      <li>I must have used too much in the beginning and did not rinse as well as I should.</li>
      <li>Has a very chemical smell too it.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin smooth as silk and after using it for a couple of weeks, I can see definite improvement of my skin.</li>
      <li>So I currently alternate between this Derma E product and Aveeno Clear Complexion, but this is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I really found that I like this cleanser even though I have &#x27;older&#x27; skin because it cleans well without drying.  </li>
      <li>However, after the first use, my face was less red and felt more calm and hydrated (but not sticky).  </li>
      <li>I have pretty sensitive skin though.</li>
      <li>In the summertime I can go without make-up completely and my skin is fine, but in the winter (upstate NY), the redness comes back a bit and on ocassion I have some itching, which I can make stop immediately with the Hyaluronic day/night cream (before using this</li>
      <li>I have had breakout issues from such mild products as Purpose, Cetaphil, Dove, and Aveeno Ultra Calming.  </li>
      <li>Overall a super cleanser.  </li>
      <li>It just kind of sucks that I can&#x27;t use it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s always been a favorite especially in the winter when my skin is dry!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m starting to believe that rosacea needs to be treated differently for different people and that&#x27;s why all the other things I had tried which supposedly worked so great for others didn&#x27;t work so well for me.  </li>
      <li>Anyhow, if you are one of the lucky ones affected by rosacea or dry skin</li>
      <li>This product does leave your skin feeling soft and clean without leaving it feeling stripped dry</li>
      <li>My dermatologist warned me that my skin would likely become very dry and even more sensitive than it already was.  </li>
      <li>It seemed to be working fine, until a few months ago when I noticed that my face stung whenever I used the soap.  </li>
      <li>Also, my boyfriend used it several times and wants to buy a bottle for himself.</li>
      <li>and I am a real nut job on facial cleansers.</li>
      <li>I am 44 years old and after YEARS (decades??)</li>
      <li>I really like derma e products, especially this cleanser.  </li>
      <li>Also the regular size use to be 8oz, now the price is higher, and you only get 6oz.</li>
      <li>The biggest problem with skincare is learning what your skin likes and dislikes, and apparently mine doesn&#x27;t like the acid.</li>
      <li>It is not greasy but does not dry out my face either,</li>
      <li>knocked it down a star because I thought i&#x27;d at least be able to use it on my legs or my body, and it actually broke my body out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I recently bought this derma E hydrating cleanser on amazon.It really worked great on my  dry , flaky skin.I use it on face ,I m very much impressed with this product .I have tried so many cleansers nothing worked for me.so far this is the best cleanser I have ever had.U can see the results with in days.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser, does not irritate my skin, great smell, cheap.</li>
    <li> It has a lovely, light plumeria scent and is very moisturizing. Follow the directions on the bottle for best results</li>
    <li> I was at a store looking at face cleansers and got into a conversation with someone who had flown into town and not brought her face cleanser because of the TSA hassles. Although I had never used Derma E, I saw this Derma E on the shelf and showed it to her. She didn&#x27;t buy it, but I did. It smells good and has the great moisture-retaining ingredient, hyaluronic acid. I use it at night to clean my face, with lots of water. It cleans the skin without feeling dry. I am in my 60s. I put on a night cream after cleansing with this product. Recently bought the Derma E hyaluronic acid night cream on Amazon, and I like it, too.  My young-adult daughter tried this cleanser at my house and used it for a few days. She has asked for some for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for cleaning your face.  Works easily and quickly</li>
    <li> This cleanser is really gently on my dry skin but works great.  I use it in combination with the glycolic scrub and vitamin A face lotion.  I put it on subscribe and save because I don&#x27;t want to run out!  Just a note, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE USED THE HYALURONIC ACID DAY AND NIGHT CREAM AND LOVE THE SERUM.  THEY SMELL GREAT AND ARE VERY GENTLE ON MY VERY SENSITIVE SKIN.  THE CLEANSER HOWEVER MADE MY SKIN STING AND BURN. SORRY TO BE SO DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> I am 44 years old and after YEARS (decades??) of acne, I started Accutane over the summer.  My dermatologist warned me that my skin would likely become very dry and even more sensitive than it already was.  Which could aggravate my rosacea.  He told me to by Cerave cleanser (with the ceramides and hyaluronic acid) and moisturizer....so of course I did.  It seemed to be working fine, until a few months ago when I noticed that my face stung whenever I used the soap.  It wasn&#x27;t super painful...but it wasn&#x27;t fun.  I saw this at my health food store and decided to try it instead.  From the first wash on, the stinging was gone.  I was SO excited!  My face does feel a little dry and tight after I wash....but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the wash or the Accutane.  I also love the scent of this product so much that I bought the night cream (I use it day and night).  Great product!</li>
    <li> I really like derma e products, especially this cleanser.  Has it erased 30 years from my 60 + year face?  Of course not, but I think it does a good job of cleansing.  Also smells nice.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product because all of the Cerave products didn&#x27;t work for me, and I was still interested in trying hyaluronic acid in skincare products. I&#x27;ll go ahead and get it out of the way: hyaluronic acid does not work for me at all, period, it causes chemical burns on my face. BUT. That&#x27;s my skins reaction and has absolutely nothing to do with the quality of the product. If you&#x27;ve had trouble with Cerave and other hyaluronic acid products, that particular acid may not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked it down a star because I thought i&#x27;d at least be able to use it on my legs or my body, and it actually broke my body out. I have pretty sensitive skin though. It just kind of sucks that I can&#x27;t use it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But anyway. The scent is pretty light and pleasant and overall as a product it has potential for people that don&#x27;t have really reactive skin like I do. The biggest problem with skincare is learning what your skin likes and dislikes, and apparently mine doesn&#x27;t like the acid. And that&#x27;s ok! That acid is meant to help retain moisture, so it sucks that it didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not my first time buying this I&#x27;ve used this cleanser for years and it&#x27;s always been a favorite especially in the winter when my skin is dry!</li>
    <li> Cleanses the face without any chemicals. The hyaluronic acid holds in moisture. Like this product very much. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Product shipped fast. Works as promised. Provides moisture to the skin. I suggest using the toner and moisturizers (day cream/night cream) for the best benefits.</li>
    <li> I found this to be a great mild cleanser which has replaced the Neutrogena Extra Gentle Cleanser that I used for years.  My skin is very acne-prone and can get too dry, so it is hard to find a product that works.  I have had breakout issues from such mild products as Purpose, Cetaphil, Dove, and Aveeno Ultra Calming.  I have also tried Proactiv, L&#x27;Oreal 360, and PanOxyl but found them too irritating.  What a disaster I am!  So I currently alternate between this Derma E product and Aveeno Clear Complexion, but this is my favorite.  It is quite expensive though, and hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I ordered the product and got to my place before expected and works wonderful. Definitely would by again when it runs out.</li>
    <li> I really found that I like this cleanser even though I have &#x27;older&#x27; skin because it cleans well without drying.  I use a cream type cleanser to remove makeup at the end of the day and use this one in the shower in the morning. I would not recommend this for removing eye makeup though because it doesn&#x27;t work well plus it burns the eyes horribly.</li>
    <li> Has a very chemical smell too it. Does just a okay job at cleansing the skin. Hydration is nothing special, just so so.&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a 3/5 product, it doesn&#x27;t suck but it isn&#x27;t that great either. Also the regular size use to be 8oz, now the price is higher, and you only get 6oz. Very pricey for the quality of cleanser.</li>
    <li> So far so good ! I like this product ,After wash face ,My face is very smooth. I will keep buy next one.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this product the moment I used it. It is so foamy and moisturizing while using it that I couldn&#x27;t believe it! My skin is dry so this feels luxurious!</li>
    <li> I like how it foams but not too much, has a fresh scent and seem to remove my make up well..all while not drying out my skin.  Overall a super cleanser.  Another winner from DermaE, I just love this brand.</li>
    <li> This cleanser doesn&#x27;t take much to Suds up and makes your face feel clean the first wash!</li>
    <li> Very good for cleasing sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and feel of this facial cleanser.  It makes my skin smooth as silk and after using it for a couple of weeks, I can see definite improvement of my skin.</li>
    <li> What else can I say? It cleans well, smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dried out. I have mostly oily skin with some dry patches (combination, on the oily side). This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased, so I&#x27;m definitely committed.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion and the hyaluronic acid!</li>
    <li> This cleanser is great for oily and irritated skin as it is neutralizing and soothing and rinses easily while removing all makeup and making skin smooth.</li>
    <li> best of all - they are cruelty free- no testing on animals&lt;br /&gt;do you know how many companies abuse animals every day? not this one&lt;br /&gt;great wash</li>
    <li> Great company but this product made my eyes burn and left a soapy feeling on my face. It is just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I don&#x27;t know what the problem was but I really feel I was wrong on my review of this one so I am amending it. Actually, this product is darn good and I am a real nut job on facial cleansers. I must have used too much in the beginning and did not rinse as well as I should. I have even used it with my Clarisonic machine and that works very well. It is not greasy but does not dry out my face either,</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I wanted to try something different from the Boscia Purifying cleanser that I have been using. I read the reviews and referenced Paul&#x27;s Beautypedia before choosing this product. This product does leave your skin feeling soft and clean without leaving it feeling stripped dry which is why I really like this product, but I don&#x27;t really enjoy the strong fragrance. It&#x27;s not terrible and goes away quickly after you rinse... it&#x27;s just strong. Also, my boyfriend used it several times and wants to buy a bottle for himself.</li>
    <li> This product works beautifully for both me and my wife&#x27;s face and my body.</li>
    <li> I had tried everything for my rosacea (prescriptions, oatmeal. avocado, coconut oil, jojoba oil, emu oil, aloe, expensive department store stuff marketed for rosacea, even the dead sea face wash from the mall).  Those things only gave me moments of relief (if any).  My face was still very red, itchy, and breaking out.  My husband laughed at me when I bought this and said that if it could cure rosacea (which it doesn&#x27;t claim to), there would be billboards for it everywhere and everybody would know about it.  However, after the first use, my face was less red and felt more calm and hydrated (but not sticky).  After a few weeks, my face seemed &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;.  It is not perfect and flawless, but I don&#x27;t think anybody would notice my rosacea anymore.  In the summertime I can go without make-up completely and my skin is fine, but in the winter (upstate NY), the redness comes back a bit and on ocassion I have some itching, which I can make stop immediately with the Hyaluronic day/night cream (before using this I was irritable all the time because my face was EXTREMELY itchy...even in the summer).  I have to say though that a friend of mine was complimenting my complexion and I told her it was better because of this product, so she tried it too and said it did nothing for her rosacea.  I&#x27;m starting to believe that rosacea needs to be treated differently for different people and that&#x27;s why all the other things I had tried which supposedly worked so great for others didn&#x27;t work so well for me.  Anyhow, if you are one of the lucky ones affected by rosacea or dry skin I&#x27;d definitely recommend giving this a try.  And if you already have good skin, I&#x27;m sure this would be great for you too.  By the way, my skeptical husband has now instructed me to buy a ton of this stuff just in case it stops being sold :)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Very moisturizing and not too harsh.  I love the smell of it, too.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin, and the Very Clear&#x27;s new formula really burns my skin (though it&#x27;s still great for more oily skin -- say, if a dog likes to roll its face all over yours daily), so I decided to give this a shot. It&#x27;s awesome! It smells AMAZING and it makes my skin so smooth! It&#x27;s a bit more expensive for me (a whole dollar right now!), but definitely worth it if your skin is a bit more sensitive.</li>
