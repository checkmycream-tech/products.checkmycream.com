      <li>Such a good peice too.</li>
      <li>Before it felt like a cool water like foundation and my skin looked amazing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>that cool</li>
      <li>My favorite foundation I use this mainly for eyeshadow primer</li>
      <li>It transfers really easily and my face gets really greasy.</li>
      <li>It provides great coverage without being to heavy....</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m not a big foundation girl but from day one of using this I was beyond satisfied</li>
      <li>Will order more next time.</li>
      <li>then they did when it first came out.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>Love it .it came earlier then</li>
      <li>i love this make up -it goes on smooth and never cakes--does not easily rub off on clothes--</li>
      <li>, I will continue to purchase this for life as long as it&#x27;s available!</li>
      <li>Loved this foundation I recommend it if you like long lasting foundation.</li>
      <li>And it is very inexpensive.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Harriett.</li>
      <li>I dont really like mousse..</li>
      <li>Great, but why am I not able to find Caramel 350 in my local stores any longer?</li>
      <li>It looks very natural.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised I normally pay 8$ in store for this</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simple to put this on, very convenient and matches well without putting a lot on.</li>
      <li>i found  out this is not a all natural ingredients item.</li>
      <li>It does not match well with my yellow skin tone and the whole &amp;#34;mouse&amp;#34; falls out of the hole.</li>
      <li>I have found no other foundation that blends soooo well with my skin.</li>
      <li>So i couldn&#x27;t use t because i have vowed to only use all natural ingredients items</li>
      <li>so im not sure of its full potential as yet</li>

    <li> I have used it for years.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be more moussey-ish than it was. Thankfully it wasn&#x27;t. It blends in perfectly with my complexion and it wasn&#x27;t too pricey. Very great product, I would definitely recommend this product to all.</li>

    <li> great product matches my skin perfect .item shipped before time and this product also has great coverage for my skin.i would buy from them again i would give them A+++ for there shipping and for the product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simple to put this on, very convenient and matches well without putting a lot on. It looks very natural.</li>
    <li> Wish they had more shades but the caramel works. It transfers really easily and my face gets really greasy. Definitely need some sort of oil controlling powder and powder to set. So right now I just use it as an under eye concealer and it seems to work for now. I love how smooth and creamy it goes on.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup and it is so easy to purchase through Amazon.  It covers great and washes off nicely.</li>
    <li> Now I gave this 4 stars just because the color looked darker but that cool I know how to work my makeup so it&#x27;s all good</li>
    <li> I love this foundation! The coverage is excellent and it has a great matte finish. Your face does not get oily at all.</li>

    <li> GREAT PRODUCT! LOVE THIS FOUNDATION.. It provides great coverage without being to heavy.... Gives the skin a nice healthy glow without having to pile on a lot of foundation to get great coverage.....:)</li>
    <li> Awesome. Will order again for sure. Excellent pricing. Will order more next time. Bought three this time. Great coverage and feels light.</li>
    <li> Loved this foundation I recommend it if you like long lasting foundation. It&#x27;s very creamy, matched my skin tone perfectly !</li>
    <li> Color is perfect but the cream is stuck to the glass top. Not worth returning.</li>

    <li> This priduct is not true to it&#x27;s word.&lt;br /&gt;The color is suposed to be caramel, but not really.&lt;br /&gt;I should have gone one shade up.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Just ordered, cannot wait to get it. Ive been looking for this makeup, that is why I ordered two. Such a good peice too. Thanks, Harriett.</li>
    <li> I tried the matte finish mousse in caramel and loved the color, but the matte was too drying. So I thought I would try this ultra-hydrating mousse foundation. Though it was not as drying as the matte finish, the caramel color in this ultra-hydrating formulation is not the same as the matte. I give it 3 stars for hydration, but color was off.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup. It gives great coverage and doesn&#x27;t cake or separate. And it is very inexpensive. Buy it!</li>
    <li> i found  out this is not a all natural ingredients item.So i couldn&#x27;t use t because i have vowed to only use all natural ingredients items</li>
    <li> This was not my color, but I guess you can&#x27;t expect the best when you order makeup off the internet.</li>
    <li> Great coverage and easy to apply.  Only con: it gets all over you throughout the day.  Don&#x27;t make the mistake of touching your face.</li>
    <li> Terrible! This made my skin look disgusting. Like I was wearing a mask. So cakey. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Covers blemishes while looking like you have on no make up at all.</li>
    <li> The coverage is the greatest...the best ever found for me. It goes on really easy and smooth and flawless. Will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> I just found out about this Foundation in December,and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This make -up last a long time,I put it on at 7 am and it lasted until 1pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best make -up ever.</li>
    <li> It was too dark for me and made me standout in a very bad way. It also made my skin look very dry.</li>
    <li> The texture is not mouse like at all. The product was dried out and I think it was old or exposed to extreme temperatures. It does not match well with my yellow skin tone and the whole &amp;#34;mouse&amp;#34; falls out of the hole. There was nothing I liked about this product.</li>
    <li> Disappointed because I thought it would be the same color as the Matte foundation but it&#x27;s not</li>
    <li> Love it .it came earlier then I thought. Will keep buying it .Thank you</li>
    <li> I wonder if they are making this differently then they did when it first came out.&lt;br /&gt;Now it makes my skin all oily and its not cool to the touch like it used to be. Before it felt like a cool water like foundation and my skin looked amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just received a defect.&lt;br /&gt;Either way I love this foundation because the caramel matches my skin tone perfectly. I have found no other foundation that blends soooo well with my skin. It matches so well that I can use it as a concealer because if I use it all over my skin gets oily looking.</li>
