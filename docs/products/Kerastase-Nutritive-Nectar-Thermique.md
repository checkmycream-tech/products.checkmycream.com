<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works very good with relaxed hair and doesn&#x27;t leave a film and isn&#x27;t heavy.  I love it and this is my second bottle</li>
    <li> It keeps my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I did not find this product living up to my expectations.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, THE best Leave-In Hair Conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used!!! I&#x27;m a Professional in the Hair Industry and have used TONS of products and lines. Yes, I can certainly agree that the Kerastase line by L&#x27;Oreal is definitely on the pricier side but, people...you get what you PAY FOR! After shampooing with a Volumizing Shampoo I run this solely through the ends of my hair and it&#x27;s like a nice hydrating drink for my drier hair! I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. It is on the richer side..so a little goes a long way and, for the price, it should...I only use about the size of a dime on my shorter hair and it&#x27;s plenty. If you have longer hair, go for about a quarter sized dollop and that should do it! Give this one a chance...I promise you, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I paid about $35 in a salon for this product. My hair is frizzy and curly but becomes manageable with a boar brush and Kerastase Nectar Thermique. If I don&#x27;t use that brush, my hair stays wild but soft. I still have to use an iron to straighten it.  I think I&#x27;ll search for a less expensive product just because I think there is a cheaper way to get same results.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this product.  It says that it is supposed to straighten your hair as a heat protectant, but that wasn&#x27;t the case for me.  I&#x27;m not sure if this works on certain type of her, but with my hair, it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I got more out of the IC Fantasia heat protectant than I did this stuff.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for anyone!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  One of the best for frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great addition to my Kerastase regimen of Bain Satin 3 and Masquintense Thick (even though I have fine hair, the thick version is awesome!).  I have very dry and sensitive hair that is damaged from being overprocessed and not getting highlights from someone who knew what they were doing.  It&#x27;s also damaged from the sun, chlorine, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice: register online with Kerastase.com in order to get emails on their specials and savings codes...and order directly from them.  I feel much more comfortable buying straight from the source to ensure I&#x27;m buying a certified, salon product.  I realized I have no way of knowing anything about this seller, and the seller is unable to guarantee this product.  Kerastase.com has sales and deals often enough that I can purchase from them with the confidence I need for the same price as this seller...and with FREE shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I realized this and found a Kerastase.com sale.  I ordered from Kerastase and planned to return this product to Above All Beauty.....but here is what happened:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning regarding Above All Beauty and buying Kerastase from them -  This what I received from them regarding my return request (this was NOT made clear to me when I first ordered the product):  \\&quot;Once your return is received and inspected by our Fulfillment Centers, we will process your refund or a replacement within in 3 to 5 business days.  Please NOTE there will 20% restocking fee or reshipping fee will apply, unless we make a mistake. Also please provide us a statement with order number and a reason why you returning or exchanging. Please Note if item was used or opened, we will not accept the return, due to the Department of Health Code.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have used Kerastase for a long time.  It really makes your dry hair manageable.  Just a drop rubbed thru damp hair and blow dry.  It is the best.  I had always bought it at the beauty salon but I found it on Amazon and it was cheaper and came right to my door in a couple of days.  It was great.</li>
    <li> I have fine, pin-straight hair and received a sample of this product from my stylist.  Before, I would never think of using anything but a light spray with fine hair, much less a cream like this product.  After the first use, I was SOLD.  Even with long hair nearly down to my elbows, I use about a dime-sized amount, combed it through, blew dry and my hair was left incredibly soft, silky, shiny, bangs controlled, and all without the look or feel of any product in your hair at all (which is the most important thing to me).  Plus, it smells wonderful, and I&#x27;m very picky about how hair products smell.  Too much will weight your hair down, so you really don&#x27;t need much at all, which makes it last a very long time--even my sample packet allowed for 4 uses!</li>
    <li> Took a little while longer to arrive, but that&#x27;s o.k., could happen to anyone.  Packaging and product were great!!  Will definitley order from, again!!  :)</li>
    <li> I found this product and used it for the first time on my hair and it is awesome!  This is an amazing product!  So sorry I didn&#x27;t find it years ago.</li>
    <li> My can&#x27;t do without product! Keeps my hair smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I shelled out the cash for this hoping it would finally be my can&#x27;t-live-without product. I&#x27;ve got thick, fairly coarse hair that I dry and straighten. I also like to have it long, but always have to cut it before I like the length because nearly every single hair is a split end. This product really, really cut down on my split ends, my hair was healthier than it had been in a long time, and to my memory-my hair was fairly soft. The smell, however, is what has kept me from repurchasing. It was gag-worthy. I can only describe it as floral smelling but whatever it was, once I&#x27;d put the straightener to my hair, it smelled like burning flowers. So gross. Even with as much as I liked the products results, I won&#x27;t use again because even now the memory of the scent makes my eyes water. Too bad-I&#x27;ll likely try other Kerastase products in the future when I buy again.</li>
    <li> If you use heat on you hair, and don&#x27;t want to look like you fry it on a daily basis the Kerastase Thermique line is amazing! It is worth every penny, it leaves my hair shiny, soft, manageable AND it gets rid of frizz. Bottom line, its the best stuff out there.</li>
    <li> As with other Kerastase products, it leaves my hair in wonderful condition and I won&#x27;t do without it. I might as well cut my hair short if I can&#x27;t have this stuff, even thought it is pricey. I don&#x27;t mind paying for stuff that does a great job when other products don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  It is silky smooth, non-greasy, and smells nice.  I have fine blond hair and have found that it works miracles on portions of my hair that have been dried out by over-highlighting.  Unfortunately, it is very expensive.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  My hair literally feels like silk after blow-drying! It&#x27;s amazing! The only problem I have now is my hair is so soft I have static cling and my hairspray doesn&#x27;t hold as well, but, those are a small price to pay for soft, shiny hair!!  I&#x27;ll definitely keep using this!</li>
    <li> After having three children the texture of my hair changed-I never knew or heard of this happening. It used to be straight and silky but now frizzy and coarse. This product conditions my hair so that it&#x27;s soft to touch. I now have to style my hair using flatiron but it has cut down the time in half if not more, and my hair looks and feels silky and shiny afterwards.</li>
    <li> I use this leave-in conditioner daily whether I shampoo or not. It detangles wet hair and leaves hair very soft. It also has a fresh citrus scent. I have been using this product for 3 years, and I won&#x27;t let myself run out.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used it before styling and I fell in love with this product instantly!&lt;br /&gt;I have light and wavy hair.It is very hard to keep style.Kerastase helps me to have nice style even next day!!!Without feeling anything on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Great product,I would recommend it to everybody.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I originally bought one in Cancun and loved it.  It was packaged differently in Cancun compared to the one I ordered from Amazon, but it was labeled the same way.  However, it doesn&#x27;t perform the same way in my hair as the one I purchased in Mexico.  Not sure if Loreal uses different ingredients between countries, but I did not get the same results.</li>
    <li> I have used Tresseme heat protector for years, but have noticed that with curling my hair so often, it wasn&#x27;t quite enough.  I also started to notice a burnt hair smell when I would curl my hair, so I tried this one after hearing it helped with that.  I love this product!  It smells amazing, which is a huge plus, but it also really protects hair and made my hair so soft and healthy.  It is a lotion, so you can really only use it when your hair is wet, but it&#x27;s great when you do!</li>
    <li> I used this product before I curl my hair and it&#x27;s so good.&lt;br /&gt;My hair look natural curly for 2 days!!!</li>
    <li> BOUNCY ABD YET FIRM AND HIDRATED HAIR&lt;br /&gt;I FOUND THIS PRODUCT TRUE TO IT&#x27;S ADVERTISEMENTS&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD NEVER WANT TO BE WITHOUT IT</li>
    <li> just what i was looking for</li>
    <li> If you have hair extensions you KNOW how hard it is to keep them in good shape.  This product is AMAZING!!  It helps keep my extensions looking silky and shiny, and keeps them feeling soft.  Nothing else I&#x27;ve used has ever worked the same.  I&#x27;ll admit to \\&quot;cheaping out\\&quot; now and then, but it&#x27;s never, ever worth it.  Then I remind myself, if I&#x27;m going to spend the money on the extensions, I should spend the money on products to take care of them!  It&#x27;s really the best leave in product, hands down!</li>
    <li> Great product if you have frizzy, thick, hard to manage hair.  Applying this product before flat ironing makes my hair shinier and prevents split ends. I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
    <li> This product is worth the cost! Love it..leaves hair full soft and shiney..only small amount needed hard to find in salons.</li>
    <li> Great heat protection and shine enhancer. To ensure not to weigh down your hair only use about a pea size amount. More is not better, a little goes a long way. Another bonus is that it smells so good. This is my favorite hair product. I have fine hair, but a ton of it. I blow dry and flat iron daily. This product keeps my hair looking and feeling very healthy.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to discover that this product contains a lot of silicone; dimethicone, an inexpensive form of silicone, is 4th on the ingredient list.  While dimethicone may leave your hair shiny when you first use it, eventually it will build up on the hair and cause breakage and damage.  My search continues for a quality product that works.</li>
    <li> excellent product. I would definitely purchase again. is well worth the price. there was a notable difference in the sheen and health of my hair.</li>
    <li> The treatment provided all the conditioning it said it would. I would certainly buy it again as it worked well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years! I have curly, frizzy hair that I blow out straight from mid September through late spring. Once the humid weather sets in I go back to wearing it curly. It is important that my curls are not damaged from the heat of the blow dryer and this product keeps them protected. It also is a fantastic smoothing product. My hair is past my shoulders, it comes out shiny and straight! Every now and again I will try less expensive products but always, always come back to this one. It is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> My wife is frequent user with this item. The price is reasonable and she is very happy. She uses this everyday. I need to buy more.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Protects my hair during drying and makes it more manageable.  I&#x27;ve used it for a while and love it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is JUST OK. Which is not acceptable when you&#x27;re paying around $100 for a shampoo + conditioner combination. I used this with the Bain Satin 2 for a while, and my hair was SO FRIZZY. It made my hair kinda soft and detangled really well, but that&#x27;s about it. The conditioner feels really light, but doesn&#x27;t actually condition at a level that deserves this price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dissatisfied, I switched to the Nexxus Hydra-Light system, since it&#x27;s about 1/3 as much money and I don&#x27;t have to go to some remote salon to purchase it. It makes my hair smooth, soft, and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I was one of the zillion people who gave this stuff flawless reviews, because I wanted to like it. It simply doesn&#x27;t work for my hair!</li>
    <li> This is great! The tube not to big but I love it.makes my hair shiny.its a must have product.get it now.</li>
    <li> I use this every day and it really helps keep the friz out of my hair and keeps it smooth with out it looking oily.</li>
    <li> I have used this in my hair for many years and love it.  It is a miracle in a bottle.</li>
    <li> I was very unhappy with the product . It is not particularly moisturizing and it has a very strong odor.  It was expensive and I wish that I could return it .</li>
    <li> I just love how this makes my hair smooth and shiny! It arrived quickly,  Try it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Best product out there for your overworked hair. I can easily feel and see the difference when I skip a treatment.</li>
    <li> I must admit, I would have never thought to try this if it didn&#x27;t show up in my Birchbox one month, and it has quickly become a product I can&#x27;t live without. I put about a dime-size in my damp hair before I blow dry it in the morning, and it really helps it stay smooth and shinier throughout the day. It definitely does NOT feel greasy or thick, which is what I love most about this product. It&#x27;s a little pricy, but you don&#x27;t need much (I have hair a few inches below my shoulders) so this bottle lasts me a couple months usually.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I have thick, highlighted/color treated wavy hair.  I have tried a lot of hair products and this is the best one I have found by far- it eliminates the frizz and makes my hair soft, shiny, and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> Absolutely nothing special. Dozens of products at less than half the amount will do as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to fight frizz and give shine, you need something clear and slippery. This product,&lt;br /&gt;disappointingly, is a creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have very dry hair, like I do, go with a very light, mixed oil and start halfway down the&lt;br /&gt;hair (don&#x27;t go anywhere near the scalp with it!) Sally&#x27;s Beauty has a wonderful oil in a spray&lt;br /&gt;that needs a minimum amount to keep hair healthy and shining...and at $11, so worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I chose to order this product because I read in some magazine that the Duchess Kate uses it (whatever, don&#x27;t judge).  But I am happy to say that I really have gotten amazing results.  My hair (highlighted) is softer, noticeably less frizz and shinier.  Really happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I love kerastase products and I am a huge fan of hair beauty products. I have long hair and decided to buy the nectar thermique as a protection for my ends during the blow dry process, but I don&#x27;t see any difference between the results with this product and a drugstore one i got for $9. Dissapointed, certainly will not buy again.</li>
    <li> love it so much bla ugh bla ugh bla  eck sigh whatevs gut fruit can car bar loot tuna dog</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different gels, mousses, shampoos, etc. to protect my hair against my blow dryer and straightener, which I use on a daily basis.  My hair would always get split ends and dry out quickly.  Kerastase Nectar was the first product that actually improved the quality of my hair.  It&#x27;s easy to put in and leaves it smooth and silky after blow drying and straightening.  I love this product--it is completely worth the price!</li>
    <li> Perfect! you wont be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This product made my blow drying routine very easy.  It left my hair soft and manageable.  It is very similar to the Shue Umera essence absolute.</li>
    <li> This hair product is great at making your hair blow out looking healthy, soft and smooth.  I have curly, fine, dry hair, so I also need to use a little Kerastase treatment oil after blow-drying, and then my hair is good to go.  The nectar thermique is the only product I ever use other then the Kerastase brand finishing oil treatment.  I have tried countless products over the years, but find that Kerastase products are the best.  Pricey, but the products are great and last a long time, so they are worth the expense.</li>
    <li> This is great if you use a dryer or a Chi, I take it with me to the salon and make them use it there!</li>
    <li> Even my husband has noticed that my hair looks healthier in only the past few weeks of use.  Not a heavy fragrance, not greasy.  Works really when with heat styling tools.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal and I&#x27;m not kidding. I&#x27;ve been using this for years and whenever I run out my hair really suffers. It is better than their ciment thermique, bettee than chi Silk Infusion, better than Living Proof leave ins. (As you can see I&#x27;ve tried just  about everything!) Just trust me, it rocks 😃</li>
    <li> Very good product for people with curly hair.  I don&#x27;t even get frizz when I use it.  I will continue to use this product and purchasing it from this seller.</li>
    <li> Another great product for dryer curly hair</li>
    <li> Love this product and the price was better than in the salon.</li>
    <li> I just recently went from my virgin dark brown hair to platinum blonde. Although I deep condition my hair weekly, I noticed it was still drying out so I got a sample of this product and saw immediate turn around. It smells great, leaves your hair shiny and well moisturized. Best part, you only need a pea sized amount for shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> I also can&#x27;t live without this product - it&#x27;s a must if I&#x27;m blow-drying my hair.  I love the way it leaves my hair so shiny!!!!  You&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
    <li> This a product that smooths without making hair flat. It also makes hair healthier! A litttle bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST product.  I have very long hair (about halfway down my back), I&#x27;m 33 and I have tried numerous products to keep my hair silky and smooth.  This one has not disappointed.  I use a Neutrogena intense hydrating hair mask once a week, towel dry, apply this product before blow drying and my hair looks incredible!  Better than it&#x27;s ever looked before.  I only wash my hair a couple times a week and, on the days I don&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll use this product before putting in curlers or using a curling iron.  Works like magic.  My ends are very healthy and my hair is shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> This really makes your hair soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, and probably be ordering this again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair care product for people that have course, thick hair that has a mind of it&#x27;s own.  I&#x27;ve never found anything like it!</li>
    <li> Helps tame my wavy (at times frizzy) hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, really works great but it&#x27;s overpriced. It would be worth it of they knocked off fifteen dollars or if they made the (already small bottle) bigger.</li>
    <li> Protects my hair from heat, doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. Smells great. Lasts a long time (9+ months). Worth the $$$</li>
    <li> Great product, helps with dry and brittle hair. Also protects hair when using heat to style.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and at a good price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years, and it always lives up to expectations.  The best styling product with thermal protection for blow dryers and flat irons.</li>
    <li> Works well for heat protecting and goes a long way. Ive had the same bottle over a year. I have dyed platinum hair a few inches past my shoulders and more than a dime can make my hair greasy (thats probably why I have so much left). It was my favorite for some time &amp; the reviews were always good for this brand&#x27;s products. Tresseme heat spray instead because it can be used on wet &amp; dry hair.</li>
    <li> Love, love love, this product.</li>
    <li> Great product, good service.</li>
    <li> This is worth EVERY penny.  My daughter cannot live without flat ironing her hair everyday and it truly protects and has cut out almost all damage.  Will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 4 even though it hasn&#x27;t been a real success  for me  It looks great, but I have super dry hair and I need a huge amount to be effective, not realistic given the price so  I save it for special occasions.  For more normal hair might work for regular use.</li>
    <li> I love the smell. And makes my hair smooth. :)</li>
    <li> Great heat protecting product. I&#x27;ve been using for 2 years now, and my hair is very silky soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Made such a huge difference!!  Detangles and softens hair.  Hydrates ends in a massive way! Hair is much smoother and silky. Would repurchase again.</li>
    <li> Used Kerastase Nutritive Nectar Thermique for a couple of years.  I feel it really protects my hair and use it every three days.</li>
    <li> Keeps hair protected from heat and soft but not greasy. This is the only product I need to use. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product! My haidresser recommended it...works GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;Saved a lot of money by buying it online!</li>
    <li> This is a good product,smells really good , a little expensive but is better to spend more fir a better product . the seller was very good and fast.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Leaves my hair very manageable and leaves my hair smelling really nice. Have purchased the smaller packaged version for traveling too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years, and I use this every day. It does not leave fine hair limp nor does it weigh hair down in humid conditions.</li>
    <li> I use this kerastase product before I blow dry my hair.  I have long hair so the ends get dry easily.  I use this in conjunction with the oleo product - and my hair stays shiny and hydrated - even after using a curling iron, flat iron or blow dryer.  It&#x27;s on the expensive side but totally worth it - especially if you use a lot of heating tools.</li>
    <li> Its a little early to review this product; for I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times. But so far, it has met with all my expectations. It smells nice, the cream is thick (luxurious) and my hair seems softer after use. But I&#x27;m still in the learning stages of how to use it properly. I have thick, highlighted, &#x27;mature&#x27; hair and needed a hard working leave in conditioner. This could be it. But I&#x27;ll write an updated review in a month or so.</li>
    <li> I only gave it a 4 bc it&#x27;s a little pricey but it does last awhile and I have long hair.</li>
    <li> I have really thick and long wavy hair. This product helps keep it in place and soft, all the while protecting my locks from heat damage. Kerastase products are wonderful!</li>
    <li> Just ordinary, nothing special. The price is really very high for the product you get. You really can get a better kerastase product for this money. Not worth it</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Hair stronger, color lasts longer, less frizz and straighter hair.</li>
    <li> Great for blowing dry curly hair.</li>
    <li> This really protects my hair and minimizes my split ends. It smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.</li>
    <li> Love the product - it&#x27;s not too heavy and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. I usually put that on and partially blow dry my hair, and then style it. That seems to work best!&lt;br /&gt;If I let my hair air dry and then put the product in before styling, it seems to take longer for my style to set it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product!</li>
    <li> This product restores the dry look and feel to hair. It is something that I do not have to use daily. ...once or twice a week is enough. The silky feel and shine is wonderful. A little bit goes a long way. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Received the order quickly, but there was no seal on the conditioner.  There is always a seal when I get it at the salon....?</li>
    <li> It says that it&#x27;s a test product.  I know that it is kerastase, but test?  Odd.  Still, nice smell and makes for smooth hair!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, Item as described</li>
    <li> I had surgery and my hair was left a disaster. I liked the product at first, very nice fragrance, but it didn&#x27;t stay conditioned, the next day it even seemed dryer. It something you have to use everyday. I will use the product again. I wasn&#x27;t that dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> Thank you for making this product affordable for me.</li>
    <li> wife said it was great</li>
    <li> Wish I&#x27;d known about this product before, it smells good, protects my hair from heating tools and is a leave in, I would definitely recommend for dry hair, it makes it feel very silky</li>
    <li> Amazing product to really nourish your hair!  Its pricey, but totally worth it.  I will keep using this product. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I took a chance, and this didn&#x27;t do anything different for my hair. I was looking for even a slight difference, but...nadda thing. Won&#x27;t buy again. I&#x27;ll pass it onto my friend to see if she likes it. She and I try lots of different ones.</li>
    <li> Nothing crazy about it... smells good though.</li>
    <li> This product is seriously amazing! I have been using heat tools since I was in 7th grade and now I have learned to appreciate my curly hair more but on those days when I do want to treat myself to a glam look I use this product to protect my hair. It smells lovely and I always thought I had to buy an expensive straightener in order to have healthier feeling/hydrated hair, with this product you do not! It&#x27;s kind of a milky serum, or liquid cream and somehow it coats each of my strands of hair without leaving my hair feeling greasy. I think the key to this product is it does not penetrate the hair strand all the way, therefore adding weightless protection and moisturizing gloss to just the outside of the hair. I also highlight my hair every other month and I think that this product has saved my hair from getting overly damaged from heat tools. I just cannot reccomend this enough for people who suffer from damaged and dry hair!</li>
    <li> This is magic is a bottle.  My hair feels young, healthy and shiny! I&#x27;ve been using it for a year and I love it! I have long, color treated hair.</li>
    <li> I originally was introduced to this product at a salon.  I have over 50 hair that is thick, course, and wavy.  With this product I can blow dry it into a smooth silky looking straight style.</li>
    <li> Best product ever made for your hair and smells wonderful. I got this in a sample once and now I cannot live without it.</li>
    <li> I have a dry and coarse hair, and I used to worry about heat damage to my hair, so I only blow dry my hair when needed.&lt;br /&gt;but with this product, it actually makes my hair more healthy and more smooth, kind like encouraging me to blow dry my hair.</li>
    <li> I was introduced of Kerastase Nectar Thermique at the salon I go to and was amazed how great it made my hair feel.  I purchased a very small tube at the salon so I could try it at home and I like the results.  Sure it&#x27;s a but costly but you only need to use a very small amount. Great product.</li>
    <li> Really helps to keep your hair healthy! After trying so many hair product and wasting money finally I found something what really works. All the product discription was right!</li>
    <li> This product smells great and is a nice finishing touch for a blowout.  You can put it on flyaway without making your hair/head look too greasy.  It really does work well and smells amazing.  However, for the price tag, I think it should be lifechanging and it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> You only need a small amount, it lasts forever, and really does the job! Leaves your hair shiny and protects it from the heat.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser originally put this product in my hair and I really liked it.  I almost never use product, but this made my thick hair really shiny and non-flyaway after blow drying and using a curling iron.  So I bought the product and am very happy with it.  It was delivered promptly, too.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist used this on my hair during my last visit and it left my hair feeling soft, smooth and clean.  Loved it so bought some for home.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product that would both protect my hair, as well as detangle at the same time.  This definitely delivered,exactly what I was looking for without leaving any greasy residue.  It leaves my hair very manageable and soft and easy to style. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner and have had many compliments to my hair since I have been using it.  Give it a shine and helps the dry; smells good too.</li>
    <li> This is the one I always use for my hair. This is great. I will definitely buy this again in the future.</li>
    <li> I use it after towel drying my hair, and leave it in.  I love it.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighted down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use a hot iron, use this on your hair first!  Your hair will shine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Horrible product.  Bought it for my son&#x27;s hair and we couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.  It would have been worth it if it helped his hair after diving.  It didn&#x27;t.  It left his hair stringy and tacky.  Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> The first time that I used this product I bought  at the hair salon and was wonderful  and now I bought over here,(more cheaper)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very unhappy, because it isn&#x27;t the same, at the first time my hair was perfect and now my hair is getting dry and very tangled.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is very good, but the leave-in is not....I cant used it any more.</li>
    <li> my hairdresser used it on my hair and my hair liked it.  The following day and the day after that it still looked great.  I recommended it to a fellow worker and at the same time I gave her a small sample.  My hair looks fuller and softer.  I thought I had misplaced my bottle of Keratase Nutritive Nectar Thermique, only to my surprise my grand daughter borrowed it and liked it.  You&#x27;ve got a great product. Best of all it is none greasy and leaves my hands feeling very soft after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,  gloria</li>
    <li> This leaves your hair smelling great all through the day. Not to mention it leaves your hair feeling super soft like you just came from a salon. I have thick/color treated hair and it does wonders to keep it soft and managable. The only downside is the price.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle hair product! I sincerely cannot believe that it works so well. I use very little of it (less than recommended amount) and it makes my hair so smooth and feel so healthy. I have thick hair with baby fine strands. Most of the time I have frizz if I do not treat my hair very gently. After using this product, I will not go back to anything else. I actually threw out a bunch of my other hair products because this stuff REALLY IS THAT GOOD. Everyone in the world should try this product!</li>
    <li> Adds body and softness to your hair.  Mine is colored and highlighted and it feels like it did when I was a child.  This is an excellent product and I even like it much better than the Moroccan Oil products</li>
    <li> Great product, pleasant scent, leaves your hair smooth, sleek and happy!</li>
    <li> Like Sublimateur de Jour much better... But I think Kerastase is discontinuing it??</li>
    <li> Love this product! your hair will really get smooth!!!!</li>
    <li> Little goes a long way!!! Great to help that damaged feeling you hair has. Apply to areas that feel \\&quot;straw\\&quot; like to the tips. I would avoid the roots</li>
    <li> Product exactly as promised and delivered as expected.  Better prices than salons and can&#x27;t get at smaller salons with only one or two locations.  Product doesn&#x27;t leave hair oily</li>
    <li> I love the Kerastase products and this product works very well on frizzy, dry, or dull hair!! My sister turned me on to the Kerastase line last year and I haven’t looked back since.</li>
    <li> Product worked well -- left my hair soft and seems to make my curls much smoother and shinier when using a curling iron! Best one so far, and I&#x27;ve tried many from the really pricey to the cheap drug store brands.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth the price, hair stays great for days. Hair is protected while drying and straightening. Smells so good. I get more compliments when I use this product. I have thick hair.</li>
    <li> this product is great for those that wash their hair everyday or use styling tools often!  It smells great and gives your hair plenty hydration!</li>
    <li> Love this  Great product</li>
    <li> Not salon quality. I&#x27;ll buy from the salon next time.</li>
    <li> If you use a blow dryer, curling iron, or straightener on a regular basis this product does a great job in protecting your hair from the heat and harsh winds.  Only a small amount applied to wet hair makes a big difference.  While it is expensive, the bottle will last for months making it well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years and I love it!  I tried using something different one time and lasted about 3 days before I bought more of this.  Definitely worth the extra money!  Keeps my hair nice and soft!  The item arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Protects my hair from daily flat ironing, and every 6 weeks highlighting!</li>
    <li> This product worked very good, my hair is thick and coarse, it smoothed out the frizz and gave it a glossy shine</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that I straighten daily. It&#x27;s very fragile/thin and breaks off easily. Additionally - since it&#x27;s so frail - it can look greasy easily - I can&#x27;t use heavy products. I use this leave in conditioner daily and it never makes my hair look greasy. I wash my hair every other day and it looks just as good on the second day.</li>
    <li> I am the last person to spend $$ on hair products.  However I recieved a free sample of this about a month ago, 2 small foil packets, and I have fallen in love.  I am a free sample junkie and have tried quite a few different leave in products, none have I ever went out and purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a by far, the best leave in I have ever tried.  Good enough for me to spend the money on, and it&#x27;s a little spendy for my taste.  The product will last a very long time, you only need a very small amount (think dime size max) and I have think long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it smell amazing but my hair has been silkier, softer, easier to manage, and super easy to style.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I visited a spa/salon while on vacation and the hairdresser tried this in my hair. My relaxed African hair over the years had a chronic history of dryness and a dull look I couldn&#x27;t shake. This product is absolutely phenomenal in my hair. It makes it so soft its unrecognizable and super shiny. I loved it so much that when I came home, I called the salon and had them ship it to me every other month until I found it on Amazon. I&#x27;d highly recommend this product for any type of hair that needs a bit of shine and softness to it.</li>
