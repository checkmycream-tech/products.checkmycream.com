      <li>I have not had any more outbreaks in almost 2 years.</li>
      <li>This stuff is a God Send!!! &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>Viroxyn works better than any product we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>However, the best time is when the sore just starts to open and water.  </li>
      <li>I also had to use it again in July 2007, and it worked fine again.  </li>
      <li>Great thing is, it costs the same as Abreva</li>
      <li>Not only does it work great to speed the healing process and stop the pain, but it eventually gets rid of them altogether.</li>
      <li>I was originally introduced to Viroxyn through my dentist about 8 years ago, but found it available on-line cheaper.  </li>
      <li>Most first aid kits have antiseptic wipes with 0.13% Benzalkonium chloride.  </li>
      <li>I used the product several times over 2 1/2 years with great success.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many of the OTC stuff, including Abreva, which was the most effective at the time (cut down time from 2 weeks to 1 week).</li>
      <li>Easy to use applicator and the treatment starts working right away.</li>
      <li>love it and highly recommend!</li>
      <li>(3 days)it started to scab over (gross, but a good thing).</li>
      <li>The best part is Walgreen&#x27;s sells their version for a few dollars cheaper!!</li>
      <li>I decided to use it anyway, and it worked just as fine as the first time.  </li>
      <li>so quick I couldn&#x27;t believe</li>
      <li>My dentist friend advised that once you get it under control...use it at the very first signs (\\&quot;tingling\\&quot;) &amp; it will work as a preventative</li>
      <li>this one actually does do a pretty good job.</li>
      <li>, I had to use two vials, but it was so worth it.  </li>
      <li>This treatment is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>It is well worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Just had lunch and right</li>
      <li>They felt dry, but weren&#x27;t splitting and looked a million times better!  </li>
      <li>Just be sure to use it as soon as you feel it coming on, and before applying it clean the sore and pat it dry.</li>
      <li>I used it the first time</li>
      <li>&quot; First aid Antseptic.</li>
      <li>I will try to buy it from another seller and see if I get better results next time.</li>
      <li>Also, be sure to rub the product not only on the sore, but around it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It absolutely works!</li>
      <li>If used at the first sign of an outbreak it will stop the virus before it ever manifests.</li>
      <li>End of the next day it was better and by Saturday evening</li>
      <li>It will take your sore from the development stage straight into the scab phase within 24 hrs!</li>
      <li>People complain about the price, but I don&#x27;t mind paying as I don&#x27;t have to walk around with a big sore on my lip for two weeks or more.  </li>
      <li>Felt the first tingling at work around 4:30PM.</li>
      <li>Expensive but absolutely the best.</li>
      <li>After I appeared to have the whole thing under control - I continued to use this every morning &amp; night for about a week in that one spot and it cleared the whole thing up!</li>
      <li>When I first used viroxyn, I was amazed at how much quicker it healed.</li>
      <li>All of the positive reviews on here really raised my hopes that this would be faster than abreva.  </li>
      <li>I had thought that the first outbreak was supposed to be the worse, but it just seemed that when they started up again, it was getting to be more and more out of control.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really works and now I don&#x27;t have to be embarassed for two weeks waiting for it to heal.</li>
      <li>It is now 7:30PM, while the blister is not yet ozing, it is very close.   </li>
      <li>really irritated it instead of drying it up.</li>
      <li>nothing really ever worked like this.  </li>
      <li>It does work better than any other product I have used to reduce the outbreak and shorten the healing time</li>
      <li>Walgreen&#x27;s has their own label of this product (exact same thing other than the packaging).  </li>
      <li>Most likely, I&#x27;m guessing, a substance that costs a tiny fraction of what it costs you to get it.  </li>
      <li>I had high hopes but foied again.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it despite the cost.  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t understand why the product is so high.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY reccomend trying this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I am happy to report that my first use of it is just as I remember: one application and the pain went away and the cold sore never appeared.</li>
      <li>Right after Christmas last year I felt one coming on</li>
      <li>So I decided to see if there was any thing new that I did not know about.   </li>
      <li>I ran out of it and my new dentist doesn&#x27;t sell it, so I purchased it from Amazon to keep on hand.</li>
      <li>Like another user said the active ingredient is fairly cheap</li>
      <li>The first time I used this (2 1/2 years ago) it was a Miracle in a tiny vial!!</li>
      <li>pretty low.  </li>
      <li>I have just tried this for the first time through my dentist; I felt the coldsore coming on and burning at night, I applied the Viroxyn as per the directions and woke in the morning to what was like the last stage of the coldsore</li>
      <li>As in only six bucks for a FULL BOTTLE of this stuff you get in three tiny vials here.</li>
      <li>No pain, blisters gone within 12 hours, completely healed within 48 hours.  </li>
      <li>They were old</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s course from blister to complete healing.     </li>
      <li>About two years ago, name-brand Viroxyn disappeared from the shelves of my local pharmacies, but it was replaced with a much cheaper store brand.</li>
      <li>I have to admit I was surprised.  </li>
      <li>The severity of mine was reduced by, I&#x27;d say, 80-90%, and it was completely gone in about 3 days.   </li>
      <li>I makes sure to use the entire vial on my sore, I dab it on and wait for it to dry then dab it again until the vial is completely empty.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it, but get the generic version at the pharmacy (CVS, Walgreens, etc).</li>
      <li>Applied first vial, being careful to follow directions to a T.   </li>
      <li>It has the EXACT SAME ACTIVE INGREDIENT- IN THE EXACT SAME PERCENTAGE</li>
      <li>I have used Abreva in the past and am pretty convinced it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
      <li>I find that Viroxyn works great, as long as I catch the cold sore early.  </li>
      <li>It is Thursday and my blister is flat no puss, just the normal redness after a blister.</li>
      <li>I could barely see it.</li>
      <li>It usually takes 7 full days from the start of the blister until the scab falls off (for me) but with this it takes about 3 to 4 days for it to run</li>
      <li>but this is the only thing thus far that I have actually seen results from.</li>
      <li>I will try to buy it from another seller and see if I get better results next time.*****like for me, after I applied it on his sore it became worse for about 24 hours.</li>
      <li>this stuff apparently has a very short (and yet to be determined?)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I find that Viroxyn works great, as long as I catch the cold sore early.  Once the blisters start growing, healing time increases exponentially.  There are OTC versions as well.  Since I found myself without a vial when the last couple outbreaks started and there was no time to get to the pharmacist, I tried some other products with the same active ingredient.  Not surprisingly, they worked for me too.  Most first aid kits have antiseptic wipes with 0.13% Benzalkonium chloride.  Many medicine cabinets have Bactine, which has the same active ingredient as Viroxyn, except in a water base.  I find that a cotton swab saturated with Bactine works just as well in an emergency.  These replacements don&#x27;t have the alcohol base, so I&#x27;m not sure if they penetrate as well.  I make up for this by applying a few times a day.  Two squirts of bactine on a q-tip costs less than $0.05, so cost is not an issue.    Disclaimer: I am not a doctor or a pharmacist, and this review is not intended as medical advice.  Consult your healthcare provider before substituting OTC medications.  Follow label instructions and warnings on all medications.</li>
    <li> Not only does it work great to speed the healing process and stop the pain, but it eventually gets rid of them altogether. I used to get a fever blister every 2 months or so. When I first used viroxyn, I was amazed at how much quicker it healed. Then after my fifth viroxyn treatment, they never came back. I have not had any more outbreaks in almost 2 years. My mom&#x27;s stopped about 3 months ago, and my brother&#x27;s seem to be spacing out more and more. I highly recommend it despite the cost.  Also, the medicine continued to work [[ASIN:B000KQ06HQ Viroxyn Cold Sore &amp; Fever Blister Treatment: 3-pack (3 Single Applications)]]past the expiration date.</li>
    <li> I have just tried this for the first time through my dentist; I felt the coldsore coming on and burning at night, I applied the Viroxyn as per the directions and woke in the morning to what was like the last stage of the coldsore---I was shocked!  It is like I treated it for days and it was finally going away!    This is where I will get my Viroxyn from now on----it sells for $97 at my dentist office!</li>
    <li> Learned about this product from a dentist friend. It absolutely works! I was having repeated outbreaks in one spot on &amp; under my lip &amp; just could not get it under control - using every product on the market. Valtrex, of course, worked but I do not want to take that. After I appeared to have the whole thing under control - I continued to use this every morning &amp; night for about a week in that one spot and it cleared the whole thing up! Has not returned. It&#x27;s been 3 mos. Expensive but absolutely the best. My dentist friend advised that once you get it under control...use it at the very first signs (\\&quot;tingling\\&quot;) &amp; it will work as a preventative and IT DOES! I think it somehow disrupts that virus in the nerve - very effectively.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from cold sores since high school and I have outbreaks about 2 to 3 times a year. I&#x27;ve tried many of the OTC stuff, including Abreva, which was the most effective at the time (cut down time from 2 weeks to 1 week). Then, my dentist gave me a sample of Viroxyn. I kept it on hand for the next outbreak and was AMAZED that it stopped/healed my cold sore quickly. It was gone in 2 days! I found the generic version at CVS (less than half the cost of the brand name) and it works just as well. I always keep at least 2 vials on hand for the unexpected oubreak. In fact, I felt an outbreak just this past Saturday (on my way to a wedding!!). I used the product within 2 hours of the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; and it was gone in the next couple of hours!! I thought I&#x27;d have to cover it up with lots of makeup, but no need. It is a lifesaver for anyone who suffers from cold sores. I highly recommend it, but get the generic version at the pharmacy (CVS, Walgreens, etc).</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff.  It&#x27;s worth every penny.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it&#x27;s never let me down yet.  I would tell anyone to try it just once and I know they&#x27;d be hooked.  I always keep it on had.</li>
    <li> Walgreens has this for $10..  It does work better than any other product I have used to reduce the outbreak and shorten the healing time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with fever blisters/cold sores since I was a kid. I&#x27;ve never been able to escape the torture of getting them! I will say though I&#x27;ve had extreme cases as well. I won&#x27;t get just one but I&#x27;ve had up to 10 at one time!!!!    I&#x27;ve used everything under the sun from perscription to over the counter and I will say this product has done a lot for me! The best part is Walgreen&#x27;s sells their version for a few dollars cheaper!! And you dont have to pay shipping and handling!    I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 years and Yes I still get multiple outbreaks but I would definitely recommend this product. It will take your sore from the development stage straight into the scab phase within 24 hrs!</li>
    <li> I bought this product during my last outbreak but it arrived too late to be useful. So I had it on hand already for this current outbreak.   Felt the first tingling at work around 4:30PM. Got home around 6:00PM, blister was not yet visible, but there.   Applied first vial, being careful to follow directions to a T.   By 10PM I could feel it spreading. Woke up in the morning with a full blown, large, ugly, painful, outbreak on my entire lower lip. Applied a 2nd vial around 11AM. It is now 7:30PM, while the blister is not yet ozing, it is very close.   It is still very painful, and growing.   I had high hopes but foied again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product over a year ago the 3 pack.  I have used everything for cold sores nothing really ever worked like this.  I used it the first time and I was at the blister stage, I had to use two vials, but it was so worth it.  The swelling went down and it was heal within a week not two week to three weeks later.  I hadn&#x27;t had to use the product until this year and the product expired Oct 2006, and it was now Mar 2007, I was bummed especially with the cost. I decided to use it anyway, and it worked just as fine as the first time.  I also had to use it again in July 2007, and it worked fine again.  I makes sure to use the entire vial on my sore, I dab it on and wait for it to dry then dab it again until the vial is completely empty. This stuff really works and now I don&#x27;t have to be embarassed for two weeks waiting for it to heal.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I just placed my 3rd order. I have gotten Fever Blisters since I was 7. This definitely speeds up the recovery process. It usually takes 7 full days from the start of the blister until the scab falls off (for me) but with this it takes about 3 to 4 days for it to run it&#x27;s course from blister to complete healing.     It is expensive and it seems like the price has went up a few dollars since the last time I purchased the product. However, I will continue to purchase it as long as the price doesn&#x27;t get outrageous. I have tried everything from Abreva, to apple cider convocations, to Lysine, alcohol, toothpaste, nail polish remover, ice..you name it I have tried it but this is the only thing thus far that I have actually seen results from. My blisters seem to laugh at Abreva :-(.  Due to the fact that it so expensive and sometimes I feel the tingling and never get a blister I do always wait for a small blister to form prior to using the product. So I cannot speak on how well it works if you just apply to the area that is tingling. I can say, in my case, when applied as soon as a blister appears it stops it from getting any bigger and it begins to heal what is already formed immediately.     I give it four stars and not five because of the price. Like another user said the active ingredient is fairly cheap so I don&#x27;t understand why the product is so high.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I actually bought the knock off brand. Same active ingredient benzalkonium chloride. I could not find the actual brand in a store. I suffer from sever fever blisters! The last one I had lasted for 2 weeks and I was unable to talk for about 5 days because of the severity. (swollen,puss,then blood from the scabs cracking) Oh gross I know! I have RX pills that you take internally and also the ones that you put on the blister and topical RX and OTC Stuff. I have very bad scars on my lower lip. Anyway. Sunday night I noticed that my lip was feeling weird, YEP FEVER BLISTER. Worst part is that my brother is getting married on Saturday! I was devastated. When I get an outbreak, I can&#x27;t go anywhere. My entire lower face is disfigured for a while.   So I decided to see if there was any thing new that I did not know about.   I found this, and drove 1 hour to get a store brand. I already had a fever blister by Tuesday when I finally got this. I had been using Abreva and Curasore. Sunday and Monday. I did not take any of my RX meds. They were old so I decided not to take them.   My point. It worked. It is Thursday and my blister is flat no puss, just the normal redness after a blister. It is healing!!!!!!!!!   It was actually cheaper than Abreva and easier. I used one vial at about 10am and another that night. I continued using Abreva On Wednesday and so on until it is healed.   I can&#x27;t believe how great this product worked. AMAZING!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Much better than Abreva or anythg over the counter however to get thefastest best results use this product the very instant you suspect a cold sore. Otherwise it will still appear but this product does help to shorten healing time.</li>
    <li> There is no better product for cold sores!!  People complain about the price, but I don&#x27;t mind paying as I don&#x27;t have to walk around with a big sore on my lip for two weeks or more.  This product makes cold sores disappear. Please never stop making this product.  It is a miracle!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from Cold sores all my life. Right after Christmas last year I felt one coming on so I went to the store and saw this and decided to give it a try. The sore went away faster than I&#x27;ve ever had one go away (even with RX brands)and I haven&#x27;t had one since. That was almost a year ago. I&#x27;ve NEVER gone this long without a cold sore.    AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s in this stuff that makes it so expensive?  Most likely, I&#x27;m guessing, a substance that costs a tiny fraction of what it costs you to get it.  However... unlike every other useless cold sore remedy I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried most of them), this product is more than just a moisutirizer or a pain reliever.  At the very first sign of a cold sore, I applied this product.  I suspect nothing will completely stop a cold sore once it has started, but this stuff came close.  I have to admit I was surprised.  Is it worth over $12 per dose to significantly reduce the typical painful and unsightly 7-10 day cycle of a cold sore?  Probably.  The severity of mine was reduced by, I&#x27;d say, 80-90%, and it was completely gone in about 3 days.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;About the expiration date fiasco also noted by another reviewer... yes it&#x27;s disturbing that there is a label attached to the product extending the original expiration date.  Even this new date is annoyingly close to the date of purchase however... this stuff apparently has a very short (and yet to be determined?) shelf life.</li>
    <li> Great product- but check the active ingredient. The secret is: IT&#x27;S THE SAME AS Bactine. Yes, THAT Bactine. As in only six bucks for a FULL BOTTLE of this stuff you get in three tiny vials here. I have no problem with someone trying to make a profit- but this is outrageous. Don&#x27;t take my word for it: Compare the ingredient of Viroxin to Bactine: It&#x27;s the same: Benzalkonium Cl 0.13%.</li>
    <li> Hi fellow cold sore sufferers. Don&#x27;t you just love how the drug companies have us under their thumbs because we are desperate to get rid of these damn cold sores?!! So we will fork out a ton of money in hopes that the newest expensive product just might work. Well good news...this one actually does do a pretty good job. But after some research online and at my local Walgreens, I came across a product called \\&quot;CureChrome\\&quot; First aid Antseptic. It has the EXACT SAME ACTIVE INGREDIENT- IN THE EXACT SAME PERCENTAGE (Benzalkonium Chloride 0.13% -The Benzocaine in Virozyn is just a numbing agent)but CureChrome costs about 10% the price. Even the Walgreens generic version of Viroxyn was $30.00 about $378 an ounce! I got a 1oz btl. of CureChrome for $3.50 NO JOKE! I put it on on day two of my cold sore. By that evening it was in the scabbing over stage. I applied it 2-3x the next day and by day 3 I could tell it was in the \\&quot;virus gone-just need to heal the skin\\&quot; stage and so I started applying Neosporin to speed up the healing process. I&#x27;m now on day 4 and there is no swelling, no pain just a bit red and flaky. By far the shortest cold sore I have ever had. I have used Abreva in the past and am pretty convinced it doesn&#x27;t do much. So there it is. This is my 1st review and I hope it saves somebody some pain and money. You can see the product on Walgreens website and compare for yourself. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s see, buy product that is past expiration date, presumably for next to nothing, offer it up for sale on amazon without disclosing it as such, them get it \\&quot;tested\\&quot; and relabel it with a later expiration date.  My confidence in the efficacy of this product?  pretty low.  I have used the product before and been very happy with it - but it was within the expiration date of manufacturer.  Now I have a product in my cabinet that I am not sure about.  This is the danger with internet purchasers and the lack of disclosure about this is very disturbing.  Could I return this for a \\&quot;refund\\&quot;.  maybe - but I am out shipping costs and time. Very disappointing experience.</li>
    <li> Viroxyn works better than any product we&#x27;ve tried. If used at the first sign of an outbreak it will stop the virus before it ever manifests.</li>
    <li> I get fever blisters several times a year.  By the time I heard of Viroxyn, this outbreak was at the \\&quot;million blister\\&quot; stage.  I used it once and by that evening, ALL of the blisters were gone.  The next day all that was left was just a dry, reddish area.  No pain, blisters gone within 12 hours, completely healed within 48 hours.  I like it!  Walgreen&#x27;s has their own label of this product (exact same thing other than the packaging).  it is 2 vials for about $13.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having breakouts for about 5 years now, but it&#x27;s only been the last several months that I&#x27;ve been getting them constantly, thanks to a bad reaction to depo-provera shots.  Needless to say, I&#x27;m off the shots.  I had thought that the first outbreak was supposed to be the worse, but it just seemed that when they started up again, it was getting to be more and more out of control.  I&#x27;d have an outbreak on my lips and then after it&#x27;d heal, it&#x27;d go to the sides of my face.  Then, after THAT would heal, it&#x27;d go back to my lips again!  I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING too, from Abreva, to Herpicin-L, to icing the area, to tea bags, to taking L-Lysine supplements.  NOTHING seemed to stop the outbreaks and I was feeling rather down about the whole thing.  Finally, while I was on vacation, I seemed to explode into another outbreak overnight and stopped by a CVS and actually bought the knock-off version out of desperation.  I haven&#x27;t even heard of this method before, but decided to give it a go.  I put it on around the early evening and by nighttime, my blisters had gone down and I was in the scabbing stage.  They felt dry, but weren&#x27;t splitting and looked a million times better!  I wasn&#x27;t embarrassed to go out anymore.  I HIGHLY reccomend trying this stuff.  I plan on buying it in bulk and keeping it around at all times.  Great thing is, it costs the same as Abreva and I don&#x27;t have to keep applying it over and over again.  Not to mention, it works A LOT faster!</li>
    <li> I will never, ever be without Viroxyn again. This medicine zapped my cold sore so quick I couldn&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;Like the saying..........&amp;#34;Don&#x27;t leave home without it !&amp;#34; This product makes the pills obsolete.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this (2 1/2 years ago) it was a Miracle in a tiny vial!! I have suffered from cold sores (fever blisters) since I was a small child. They always took about 8-10 days to fully go away (if they didn&#x27;t spread). My dentist turned me onto this. I was getting a rapidly growing cold sore but went to my dental appointment anyway. She sold this to me. I was VERY skeptical. I used it in the parking lot (it burned like hell for about 5 seconds). By the end of the day it started to heal. By the end of the next day it was almost gone. I used the product several times over 2 1/2 years with great success. My 12 year began to develop these from time to time and I have used it on him with great results. I ran out of it and my new dentist doesn&#x27;t sell it, so I purchased it from Amazon to keep on hand. I am never without this stuff. I always keep one in my purse. Just be sure to use it as soon as you feel it coming on, and before applying it clean the sore and pat it dry. DO NOT drink or brush your teeth for at least 30 minutes after applying, or it won&#x27;t work. Also, be sure to rub the product not only on the sore, but around it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATE**** This Thursday morning I awoke and felt the familiar beginnings of a cold sore, and used the Viroxyn immediately. I thought I had been sold a dupe b/c for the rest of the day it grew and became swollen-like the application of the Viroxyn really irritated it instead of drying it up. By late that night it seemed to have stopped growing. End of the next day it was better and by Saturday evening (3 days)it started to scab over (gross, but a good thing). By Monday night (5 days)it was still there, but way better. By Wednesday afternoon (day 7) I could barely see it. Took WAY longer to heal this time. And on that same Monday afternoon my 12 yr old developed a cold sore(I&#x27;m sure he got it from me). I used the Viroxyn on him. It is Wednesday night and though it has not spread, it&#x27;s not healing that well. And just like for me, after I applied it on his sore it became worse for about 24 hours. The only thing I can think of is maybe the vials I received were perhaps expired. So I knocked off 2 stars b/c it really didn&#x27;t seem to work this time, and I feel like I wasted $50. I&#x27;m really disappointed. Has anyone else had the same results? I will try to buy it from another seller and see if I get better results next time.*****like for me, after I applied it on his sore it became worse for about 24 hours.

    <li> Just had lunch and right after I felt that first tingle... touched my lip and felt the Cold Sore coming on.  I hadn&#x27;t had a Cold Sore in probably 6 months and I was headed to San Diego for vacation in 2 days.  You can imagine how pissed I was.  Anyhoo... I went to CVS to get Abreva and saw this on the shelf.  It had 2 virals and said one time application.  I was skeptical but said what the heck... the toal for the Abreva and this was $40.  Went to my car and immediately followed the directions and applied it to the cold sore.  I could feel it starting to work immediately and within 2 hours it wasn&#x27;t even visible anymore.  Just to be safe I used the 2nd application the next day and it was GONE!!!  My vacation was saved and like other posters on here I stocked up on this stuff just incase.  This stuff is a God Send!!! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> All of the positive reviews on here really raised my hopes that this would be faster than abreva.  Quite the opposite.  I used two vials of the OTC CVS version in a 4 hour span and it had zero impact.      Now I&#x27;m even more frustrated because I could have at least been using Abreva all morning.  For me, Abreva usually clears everything up in 3-4 days.      I was hoping for a faster solution, but it looks like Abreva is still the best for me.</li>
    <li> This really works if you use it the minute you feel a cold sore, but it is also way expensive.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  It&#x27;s like a total miracle cold sore medicine!  I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it.  It is well worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;I love it and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I think I have tried every marketable product for cold sores, and Viroxyn is the only one that works for me.  I get cold sores on and in my nose, and on my lips.  If I use Viroxyn at the the \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; sign of an oncoming cold sore, it prevents it.  However, the best time is when the sore just starts to open and water.  I just saw an ad today for Orajel Single Dose, and the ingredients and other info on the package is the same as Viroxyn.  I have felt Viroxyn was well worth what it cost, although expensive.  I plan to check out Orajel Single Dose and the price as it will be sold locally and not necessary to order.  I was originally introduced to Viroxyn through my dentist about 8 years ago, but found it available on-line cheaper.  I never travel without it.</li>
    <li> Expensive!! Hard to get!! But it works!! Bactine does not for me.</li>
    <li> This treatment is worth every penny. Easy to use applicator and the treatment starts working right away. I have been using this product for a few years now and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I first discovered Viroxyn about four years ago, when I got my second-ever cold sore. One application when the burning-tingling pain started and it was over. Sore never even popped out. After that, I was hooked and used it for my twice-yearly outbreaks. About two years ago, name-brand Viroxyn disappeared from the shelves of my local pharmacies, but it was replaced with a much cheaper store brand. Great! Same ingredient, much less expensive!  Problem is, the store brands burn the everloving hell out of my lips. Half an application of store brand leaves me looking like I spent two days in the desert without lip balm and it takes a week for my lip to heal and basically grow back. (This is as painful and disfiguring as a cold sore.) After the last episode like that, I gave up and spent for a 3-pack of Viroxyn. I am happy to report that my first use of it is just as I remember: one application and the pain went away and the cold sore never appeared. My lips are a little dry, but not anywhere near what they were with the off-brand. I don&#x27;t know why this is, but I&#x27;m sticking with Viroxyn.</li>
