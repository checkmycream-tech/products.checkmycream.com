<li> The bottles of nail polish are pretty small and they don&#x27;t last long on your nails.</li>
<li> Dryer takes about two minutes to surface dry polish.  </li>
<li> The nail polish was little small, not to much to work with</li>
<li> My granddaughters are enjoying it, but I was disappointed.  </li>
<li> She recommends for other tweens experimenting with colors.</li>
<li> Not worth the price.</li>
<li> This was a waste of money.</li>
<li> Not sure if it&#x27;s all dried up or what.</li>
<li> Pretty disappointed with this kit.</li>
<li> This was very disappointing for my 6 year old granddaughter.</li>
<li> The girls like the nail polish but had no patience to wait for drying (which was very slow).  </li>
<li> I think she played with it twice before it got pushed to the corner with all the other crap toys.</li>
<li> Just blows out cold hair - while you press it with your hand.</li>
<li> The polish that comes with it is water based - so it washes off and looks bad in about an hour.</li>
<li> Hate to give a bad review, but this is just a bad toy.</li>
<li> This was not a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;inexpensive&amp;#34; product, and I am extremely disappointed..</li>
<li> Very disappointing.</li>

    <li> My daughter received this as a gift. The nail polish doesn&#x27;t work. Not sure if it&#x27;s all dried up or what. The nail dryer is ok. Just blows out cold hair - while you press it with your hand. Pretty disappointed with this kit.</li>
    <li> The nail polish is sub-par, but my 6 year-old daughter does not seem to mind. Definitely brings smiles to their faces.</li>

    <li> Daughter uses it all the time.</li>

    <li> Of all the nail polishes that were included, only the yellow one was usable.  This was very disappointing for my 6 year old granddaughter. This was not a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;inexpensive&amp;#34; product, and I am extremely disappointed..</li>
