<li> Only thing is it doesn&#x27;t go well with my hair wash routine since i wash it every other day, by the next day of not being washed it makes my hair oily.</li>
<li> I have curly, dry and unmanageable hair.  </li>

<li> not sure if it is the same one my hair stylist uses, because my hair do not feel the same.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> Both bottles I received had broken tops on them making it impossible to use the product effectively.  </li>
<li> Pumps were broken, which appears to be typical based on other reviews, I solved problem by switching them out for simple bottle caps from other pharmacy bought products used in the past.</li>
<li> I just prefer not to wash my hair everyday, but i still use it.</li>
<li> Delivery was speedy and items were well package which means pumps were broken prior to being shipped.</li>

<li> pump on conditioner was broken.  </li>
<li> It is a FAKE product.</li>
<li> Either way I was very disappointed with what I received.</li>

    <li> The shampoo and conditioner are great, but the packaging that this came in seemed like it was packaged for another country and not the quality I am used to... The actual shampoo and conditioner seem authentic.</li>

    <li> Very drying. Smells great.</li>
    <li> I did&#x27;t see a huge difference in my hair for the price I paid for the shampoo/conditioner. I also didn&#x27;t care for the pump system on the bottles.</li>

    <li> It does work and it keeps your hair moisturized and soft! Only thing is it doesn&#x27;t go well with my hair wash routine since i wash it every other day, by the next day of not being washed it makes my hair oily.
