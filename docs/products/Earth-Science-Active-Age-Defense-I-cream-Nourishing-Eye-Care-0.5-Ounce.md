### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s wonderfully moisturizing.</li>
      <li>The best eye cream I&#x27;ve found--and</li>
      <li>I am a forty something woman and feel that this is a great product for my age range.</li>
      <li>This product feels great around the eye area.</li>
      <li>great product, arrived before estimated delivery date.</li>
      <li>Great price too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 28 and trying to take really good care of my skin.</li>
      <li>It is good for the price and does what&lt;br /&gt;I would expect, which is moisturize.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and smells pleasantly, but very lightly, of melon.</li>
      <li>Very light</li>
      <li>but I have found another product that works much better for me.</li>
      <li>Once I got more and started using it at night and during the day, I noticed a difference.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more of this brand.</li>
      <li>Love this cream.  </li>
      <li>Some of the better eye cream out there.</li>
      <li>I love everything about this eye cream.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Environmentally safe hair-,</li>
      <li>It adds a nice amount of extra moisture around the eye area and has a wonderful fresh melon scent.  </li>
      <li>Package and cream were brand new in great condition.</li>
      <li>Great product not too greasy and agreeable with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Great for smoothing fine lines and sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>Very nice natural eye cream from a company in Santa Barbara.</li>
      <li>Price is excellent and ingredients are similar to MUCH, MUCH higher-priced products.</li>
      <li>This seems to be perfect for a late 30 something maybe 40 something (?) skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so light and dissipates instantly and smells fresh and feels so good.</li>
      <li>Like others said it works well under makeup and is natural, which is nice.</li>
      <li>I just finished using my 1st tube of this product and really enjoyed using this product so much that I&#x27;ve purchased another tube of it.</li>
      <li>Luckily, this product is inexpensive.</li>
      <li>I am obsessed with ingredients sometimes, and this product has an awesome assortment of enriching stuff: glycerin, aloe vera, squaline, calendula, melon fruit, licorice root, honeysuckle, ginseng root, primrose oil, avocado oil, jojoba seed oil, corn oil, and shea butter and more.</li>
      <li>I thought this would be a nice product to smooth those out and just improve the overall appearance of the skin around my eye.</li>
      <li>Must incorporate many other factors to age gracefully :)  ..</li>
      <li>Non greasy, and seems to soak right in and eliminate lines.</li>
      <li>It blends right into my skin.  </li>
      <li>I had purchased another product by Earth Science that was recommended by a plastic surgeon on Dr. Oz, which I use and like very much.  </li>
      <li>This product seems like one of those &amp;#34;instant fix&amp;#34; products, when you put it on your eyes look good, but after a few hours it has a reverse effect.</li>
      <li>No dramatic improvements, but I have never found any face or eye cream that has done so.</li>
      <li>I have not noticed much improvement by way of fine lines and wrinkles but it seems to be keeping them from growing larger.</li>
      <li>Being 27, I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles</li>
      <li>Seems to be a decent product</li>
      <li>I think I am going to stick with my normal moisturizer and not use this ever again.</li>
      <li>I use a heavy duty eye cream at night, but during the day I wear this because it works much better under makeup.</li>
      <li>and then it&#x27;s gone, and my eyes feel soft and supple.</li>
      <li>A common issue I&#x27;ve had with eye creams is that they flake up on my skin, either when used on top of a regular moisturizer</li>
      <li>not other eye cream has done this to me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very nice natural eye cream from a company in Santa Barbara. Doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes or skin at all. Package and cream were brand new in great condition. Website says: \\&quot;Environmentally safe hair-, skin- and body-care without irritants, soaps, petroleum, toxins, heavy metals, artificial colors, animal ingredients or parabens\\&quot;. Not tested on animals. Made in USA. Website is earthsciencenaturals.com. I&#x27;ll be ordering more of this brand.</li>
    <li> Some of the better eye cream out there. Great price too. Non greasy, and seems to soak right in and eliminate lines. I ran out and noticed a disgusting difference in my eye areas. Way too many lines and bad skin texture. Once I got more and started using it at night and during the day, I noticed a difference.  This seems to be perfect for a late 30 something maybe 40 something (?) skin.</li>
    <li> I am not completely sure if I see a difference with this product or not, but I can tell you that I like the way my skin feels when I use it.  I use it in combination with a much more expensive eye cream and the combination of the two make my eyes look youthful.  Maybe it is all in my head, but I plan to keep buying this product as the extra moisture gives me the kick that I need.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on the smell. It&#x27;s so light and dissipates instantly and smells fresh and feels so good. After my last eye cream being way too perfumey, this is a relief. I think the smell is solely from the ingredients. Just a hint of melon, and then it&#x27;s gone, and my eyes feel soft and supple.</li>
    <li> The best eye cream I&#x27;ve found--and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them.  This also lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this eye cream. It goes on smoothly and smells pleasantly, but very lightly, of melon. It&#x27;s wonderfully moisturizing. I am obsessed with ingredients sometimes, and this product has an awesome assortment of enriching stuff: glycerin, aloe vera, squaline, calendula, melon fruit, licorice root, honeysuckle, ginseng root, primrose oil, avocado oil, jojoba seed oil, corn oil, and shea butter and more. Each night I look forward to using it to prevent wrinkles. I&#x27;m 28 and trying to take really good care of my skin. My budget isn&#x27;t that big. Luckily, this product is inexpensive. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> age is aging.  Must incorporate many other factors to age gracefully :)  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..</li>
    <li> Like others said it works well under makeup and is natural, which is nice. No dramatic improvements, but I have never found any face or eye cream that has done so.</li>
    <li> Another product from Earth Science that I like. There products are all priced well and myself I have never had any reaction from the items that I use.</li>
    <li> great product, arrived before estimated delivery date.</li>
    <li> I had purchased another product by Earth Science that was recommended by a plastic surgeon on Dr. Oz, which I use and like very much.  Which was why I decided to give the eye cream a try.  It is good for the price and does what&lt;br /&gt;I would expect, which is moisturize.</li>
    <li> A common issue I&#x27;ve had with eye creams is that they flake up on my skin, either when used on top of a regular moisturizer and/or when makeup is applied afterwards.  This product does not flake up.  It blends right into my skin.  It adds a nice amount of extra moisture around the eye area and has a wonderful fresh melon scent.  I have not noticed much improvement by way of fine lines and wrinkles but it seems to be keeping them from growing larger.</li>
    <li> I use a heavy duty eye cream at night, but during the day I wear this because it works much better under makeup. Price is excellent and ingredients are similar to MUCH, MUCH higher-priced products.</li>
    <li> I quit using this after a few days because it made my eyes burn and blur - not other eye cream has done this to me.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a decent product but I have found another product that works much better for me. I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Dried out and irritated my skin for about a week. No returns are allowed.</li>
    <li> Sinks in and soothes ... No irritation or fuss.. Great product not too greasy and agreeable with sensitive skin.  Very light and I see improvements.</li>
    <li> Being 27, I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles but I am starting to get little crows feet on the corner of my eye. I thought this would be a nice product to smooth those out and just improve the overall appearance of the skin around my eye. I used this product for about 3 weeks as recommended, twice a day, and I had horrible results. The skin around my eye is completely wrinkled, dry, and looks horrible. This product seems like one of those &amp;#34;instant fix&amp;#34; products, when you put it on your eyes look good, but after a few hours it has a reverse effect. Then when you wake up in the morning you look like Dracula with wrinkled disgusting eyes. I think I am going to stick with my normal moisturizer and not use this ever again. It doesn&#x27;t work longer than 2 hours.</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  Great for smoothing fine lines and sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I just finished using my 1st tube of this product and really enjoyed using this product so much that I&#x27;ve purchased another tube of it. This product feels great around the eye area. It&#x27;s moisturizing without being greasy or clogging pores. I am a forty something woman and feel that this is a great product for my age range.</li>
