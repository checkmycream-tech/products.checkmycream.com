    <li> Been using this sunscreen for years. It&#x27;s great for outdoors sweaty sports - never stings your eyes.</li>
    <li> This sport formula works really well! Even with the best sunscreen, reapplying is the key as the dermatologist strongly suggests.</li>
    <li> This is great sunscreen.  It disappears into your skin, and stays on quite well.  Mild scent. I have sensitive skin. And this doesn&#x27;t bother. Y face at all.  Walking or working outside makes me sweat, and this doesn&#x27;t run! One of the only ones that doesnt run into my eyes.  I&#x27;ve been using this for @5 years, first recommended by a FL dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Use it everyday.  Ingredients are some of the best that can be found that are safe to use daily according to my dermatalogist</li>
    <li> It is an excellent protector for your face.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great - great protection, it&#x27;s not sticky or greasy. It&#x27;s easy to wash off with water, which for me is a good thing - some other sunscreens I have you have to use soap and scrub to get it off. But you probably have to reapply after some sweating. This is my favorite sport sunscreen.</li>
    <li> i love skinceuticals for sun screen. This is the first time i have tried the SPF 50. I like the consistency of the 30 or 40 better.&lt;br /&gt;MFS</li>
    <li> Stays on even while running or engaging in vigorous exercise - non-irritating for sensitive skin.  It is pricey but worth it - I use it for face and hands.</li>
    <li> Works well and no issues with my skin</li>
    <li> I have used Skinceuticals Sport UV Defense SPF 45 every morning for over a decade and am a huge fan of all their products. I dismissed the bad reviews and purchased this product anyway.  It is horrible.  The complaints about flaking and peeling are true.  The product peels and sloughs off your face (at least I hope it is just the product and not my skin in addition to the product).  It comes off in sheets and looks like you have sheets of dead skin peeling off your face.</li>
    <li> I live in the Virgin Islands and wear this sunscreen every single day. I wear it under my makeup at work or on weekends all by itself.  My face NEVERS burns and it is not irritating.  It is expensive which is why I only wear it on my face and a little on my neck.  The cheaper stuff is for the rest of my body.  I am also a runner and dab a little on my face before setting out.</li>
    <li> 5 years old is my dayghter and her body burned and she use it for her scars. Perfect sunscreen  protector from the sun.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for 6 yrs. by far best in market</li>
    <li> Excellent product for protection  from the sun. I live at 8400 feet and have a lot of sun exposure. This is the only product I use for my face.</li>
    <li> Love - fantastic sunscreen.  I usually wear for tennis or skiing and I never get burned.  It doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes.  It&#x27;s thicker consistency feels good on my skin, and I feel moisturized as well as protected.</li>
    <li> great for my daughter who plays soccer. I did not want to compromise on quality. she&#x27;s never burned nor tanned when using this SPF. it holds for quite a long time and you&#x27;d never know she was out in the smoldering heat and sun all day.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time...love it and this is the most reasonably priced place to get it.</li>
    <li> It absorbs at first, but sweat even the slightest and you have white spots all over your face. Not a good sunscreen at all on a hot day. Even worse if your doing any kind of physical activity. It runs all down your face onto clothing and into your eyes.</li>
    <li> I am child of the 1950&#x27;s, born well before the dangers of UVA/UVB rays were recognized.  In my childhood, we would spend entire summer days at the beach without any sun protection, because it had not been invented.  In my mid teenage years, the first sun block was developed and this was a greasy, white form of zinc oxide that very fair complexioned children were forced to wear at the beach to cover their nose.  It looked awful, and it was embarrassing to wear.  Then in the 1970&#x27;s, the first form of sun block was introduced, and those of us in our 20&#x27;s, not understanding the dangers of skin cancer, or the damaging effects these rays would have on our skin, used cheap and mediocre drugstore brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am in my middle-aged years, on the verge of approaching the &#x60;senior years&#x27;, and as we age, we start to scrutinize, not only our own faces, but also those of our friends and contemporaries.  Those lines and wrinkles are inevitable, and I noticed those ugly brown/beige marks on so many faces in my age bracket.  Then, upon close examination and to my dismay...I had them too!  I started buying Dark Spot Corrector Creams and sought out a good dermatologist.  She suggested a CO2 treatment, which was expensive and painful, and I became conscientious about using a good sunscreen all the time and throughout the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose the Skinceutical sunscreen, because Skinceuticals is a well-known and well-respected skin care line, co-founded by a medical doctor.  The sunscreen is a lightweight, white creamy substance that immediately and completely absorbs, leaving NO residue and no shine.  It acts very much like an excellent moisturizer, leaving my skin soft and supple.  I apply it every day, right after my moisturizer and before any make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Skinceutical SPF 50, because I want the extra protection.  It is my single most important skin care product.  I have been known to try different face serums, oils, moisturizers, and make-up, but I NEVER deviate from my trusted Skinceutical sunscreen, this is too important as it involves the protection and health of my skin.R deviate from my trusted Skinceutical sunscreen, this is too important as it involves the protection and health of my skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this sunscreen for years (the SPF 45) and thought I would try this \\&quot;new formula\\&quot;.  I don&#x27;t know what the new formula is but this stuff doesn&#x27;t absorb into my skin well at all.
