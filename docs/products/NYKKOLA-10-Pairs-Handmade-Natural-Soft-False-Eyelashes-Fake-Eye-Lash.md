<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I Love these so much. I had to trim them a bit because they were a little too long for my liking. Other than that, they look very natural and extremely soft.</li>
    <li> Very very thin , shipping took FOREVER</li>
    <li> Item was as described.</li>
    <li> They so natural and well fitting, Love!!</li>
    <li> Too long for me but they do fit nice</li>
    <li> Great price! Great lashes!!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t conform to eye shape. the band is like a tiny soft string that doesn&#x27;t hold a curve on its own. worth the price.</li>
    <li> There were every thin because they are made with thread making them very hard to put on. They also don&#x27;t come with glue. Besides that once you put them on they stayed on very well and wouldn&#x27;t bug you like other fake eyelashes</li>
    <li> I hate it the weft is too thin</li>
    <li> Very Cheap. Perfect for Arts and craft project. Not for wearing impossible to put on due to quality.</li>
    <li> They are extremely soft &amp; natural looking. I really love them. I have ordered a couple of lashes before and out of all them, these our my ultimate favorite. The most realistic ones yet. You could wear these everyday, if you wanted to. But wouldn&#x27;t suggest for the club or anything because they aren&#x27;t dramatic enough. They are absolutely beautiful. I cannot stress that enough. For the price I would order about 10 more. No lie. When I wear them, sometimes I forget I have them on, they look extremely real. The band is very soft and some people say that its a problem but I think It makes it easier to shape to my lid and to stay on. Cannot be happier about this product than I already am. Very satisfied :D</li>
    <li> If I could give this a negative 100 I would I didn&#x27;t even receive the produce and I was charged</li>
    <li> Very natural looking, but when I put these on-- my eyelashes do not look any difference.  So since it doesnt define or compliment my eyes it is pointless to spend time putting them on. I think this is better for girls with undefined or short lashes.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely beautiful. Very natural looking but long lashes that make your eyes stand out. These have been the nicest ones I have found ever. I&#x27;ve bought plenty of packages like these and these are lovely. Can be worn alone with no make up and they look so natural. I definitely recommend these if you dont want ones that look fake. These blend in with your lashes. I will keep buying these.</li>
    <li> they look pretty natural&lt;br /&gt;it IS really hard to put them on though because of the string... but theyre comfortable and give my lashes a little more thickness... although my lashes are as long as these haha</li>
    <li> i use the dou lash gel thing in black.. just letting you know. Okay so these came quick and nicely packaged, the lashes were all lined up perfectly. Im not used to these things and not comfortable yet.. so i trim them down a little and cut them in half and place them further down so that it looks more natural (if that made any sense) i just wanted a fuller look, nothing dramatic. My first time with lashes were with Ardell and i think i like those better. But these work for other people so they are still great for the pros i guess</li>
    <li> I brought many sets from this seller before and it was excellent, however ,I recently bought two more set and the lashes were different material and it look so fake instead natural. It was disappointing and I probably not going to use it but throw it away.</li>
    <li> GREAT LASHES FOR EVERYDAY USE</li>
    <li> Is my first time using this but I really love them, they are easy to use and they look very natural I use this everyday. I totally going to buy them again, and they arrived before the time of the delivery estimated.</li>
    <li> THEY ARE JUST WHAT I WANTED .I SUGGEST THAT THE WOMEN THAT WEAR EYELASHES  SHOULD TRY THESE ...THANK YOU.THAN YOU.....</li>
    <li> eye lash feel really soft and it&#x27;s good condiction to reuse again. i really like it will order them again.</li>
    <li> Quality of this product was poor. I  Will NOT be ordering this product again. Lesson learned ,  you get what you pay for....  Cheap</li>
    <li> Saw all the good reviews on here for this product and since the lashes were such a good deal, I thought I would give them a try. I used Duo adhesive to put these on (which has worked fine for my other fake lash brands), the bands are so tiny, made of string, and just will not stick. An hour after putting them on the lashes are lifting off my eyes. This happened multiple times. They are flimsy and difficult to work with. Will not be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Very nice especially for the price.</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE LASHES !! These are my GO TO LASHES !! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> very hard to put on, and don&#x27;t look natural at all</li>
    <li> Obviously they are long here, but of course you can shape then to your eye! These things are amazing and came a couple days before the actual shipping date! They are super side and don&#x27;t have hard edges that bother your eyes! Such a great price too! DOES NOT COME WITH GLUE FOR LASHES!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect Eyelashes. Best I&#x27;ve ever bought. will continue to buy</li>
    <li> love it, its nice and natural.</li>
    <li> So glad I bought these eyelashes. I cut them to fit my eyes perfectly and they look great. All you need is really good eyelash glue and you&#x27;re set!!!</li>
    <li> These are some of the more natural-looking lashes I&#x27;ve come across, which I love.  If you&#x27;re looking for a dramatic falsie look, you might be underwhelmed, but doubling up the layers will help.  Personally, I prefer the natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the band is threadlike and very flexible, which I think is important for lashes to stay on and makes it easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these lashes are a fantastic value,  I would order them again and I would recommend them to anyone looking for natural-looking strip lashes.</li>
    <li> LOVE!  Very natural.  They&#x27;re thin so be careful, but you will love these eyelahses.  Once you leann how to place them, they&#x27;re very easy to work with.  I would recommend these to beginning users of eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately these lashes lack quality, and are not worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> Extremely soft and supple. Best purchase for the quality and price.</li>
    <li> It says &amp;#34;long eyelashes&amp;#34; but in reality they&#x27;re the same length as my own.. Might work for others with shorter eyelashes than mine.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, they seem to work just fine. Not complaining other than the length.</li>
    <li> First time using false lashes and I liked them they made me eyes pop</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many other brand named lashes.. These are by far the best, very natural and great price. Will order always. Shipping is pretty slow</li>
    <li> i actually liked these they are so natural but yet so long they&#x27;re perfect size get ethem</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the type to wear faux eye lashes often, but like to when going out. I&#x27;ve tried a few in the past but thought they were too obviously fake. These are nice because they look more natural. The trick is to cut some off the end where it meets the inside corner of your eye. Also glue very close to the lash line then put eyeliner over it. They give a nice extra umph to your look without going over the top dramatic.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loves these eyelashes! I&#x27;m not a fan of fake eyelashes that look so fake and huge, personally. But these were thin and I trimmed mine and they look great! I suck at puttin eyelashes on and these weren&#x27;t too difficult after a few times practicing. The only thing is it doesn&#x27;t come with glue!</li>
    <li> A little thin I jus put on to sets n perfect cant bet that price...took a while to arrive</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast !! It&#x27;s very natural looking just how I like it ! I will definitely order more!</li>
    <li> While the lashes do look natural they are way too long and reach my eyebrows. Also they came all messed up in the package and I had to try and fix them which was very hard to do. They look natural only as long as you have VERY long eyelashes which most people do not.</li>
    <li> These Eyelashes Suck! I Got To Cut The Edges In Order To Fit, They Look So Small.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these. They are very natural. Do not buy them if you like the drag queen look. Highly recommended for the makeup gurus.</li>
    <li> Love these for the price they look natural I cut them in half and use them in the ends</li>
    <li> I love them! The only reason why I cant give them five stars is because the packaging sucks. The lashes are INCREDIBLY natural looking. I used duo lash glue and got 2-3 uses out of one pair! Keep in mind that these lashes are hard to apply and not for begginers.. you&#x27;ll definitely need some practice.. other than that I love these and ill be buying them again soon!</li>
    <li> At this price I had to give these lashes a try, all the while with low expectations, but I am very, very impressed with these and will order more! I own and have used many high end professional lines along with Ardell and now like these the best. They actually look like human hair, not strips of plastic, are multiple lengths for a feathery look and even crisscrossed at the base for added volume. The band is also very malleable and thin giving the look of liquid eyeliner instantly and best of all, when they&#x27;re on, you don&#x27;t even feel them. If you want natural looking, wispy length, similar to eyelash extensions definitely try these.</li>
    <li> Not very good rip when talki ng of carbord.</li>
    <li> Very natural and comfortable and will order more when I need them!  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> These arrived sooner than expected, but they are plastic, and don&#x27;t look very natural to me. I may keep them for Halloween costumes.</li>
    <li> I actually love these lashes , they look natural and are cheaper than just one pair its a great deal !</li>
    <li> Horrible even for the price</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t have adhesive.  should have said so....</li>
    <li> These lashes are long , but they are thin . it was hard apply them . maybe its because I am use to thicker lashes . but the shipping was fast &amp; these lashes reusable.</li>
    <li> Paid cheap price for them so they aren&#x27;t the best quality. Been using fake lashes for over 10 years and this is one of the few times I did not like the way they looked.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT, WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> They are beautiful lashes so soft and natural looking/feeling. They shipping was really fast I got them in a couple of days. They were a little hard to put on but the band is small for a more natural look so I didnt mind that! Buy these!!</li>
    <li> You have to trim the inside and the outside because there are extra threads and has no eyelash glue</li>
    <li> they are great! had issues with them seller sent me some right away thankyou ! &#x27;y eyelashes are amazing! recommend these to everyone</li>
    <li> I love these lashes, I&#x27;m done buying the more expensive, yet so cheap false lashes at the retail stores. Theses are so easy for me to apply and remove. I&#x27;m proud to say I wear Falsies!</li>
    <li> Natural looking, came quick.</li>
    <li> Favorite eyelashes. Light weight and fits perfectly</li>
    <li> Omg I absolutely loooove there eyelashes people think there my actual lashes I buy them every time I&#x27;m about to run out</li>
    <li> I love these eyelashes! I already have long lashes but I hate putting mascara so I use these babies. I would highly recommend these ❤️ I never post a review on anything but since I love these and want to purchase like 1000 of them I&#x27;m posting it. Lol amazing product</li>
    <li> Teaching students or consumers on less expensive lashes is always a better choice. I will order again in the future</li>
    <li> They look very natural and easy to apply, and they are very light; you&#x27;ll totally forget you have lashes on.</li>
    <li> Perfect&amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;It took awhile to get here but it was worth of waiting lol&lt;br /&gt;I prefer wearing this lashing with a natural smoking look for a everyday&lt;br /&gt;Other then that it feels amazing.</li>
    <li> I reviewed these in the mail the other day and finally tried them, they are really amazing! They feel light so you don&#x27;t even notice them, and the blend well with my lashes. I would really recommend them!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> They do look natural. That much I like about them. They are just waaaaay to long. And I do hate the cloth band. They are hard to apply. I have to cute them in smaller pieces to apply them. If you can do it well, they look really natural and nice. It wont look like youre wearing fake eyelashes, which is what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Natural as ever, not too flashy. Perf👌</li>
    <li> The product never reached me. and instead I get a product that I never pedi and it is useless, with the name of the seller. really do not know what to do in these cases.</li>
    <li> The best natural looking lashes</li>
    <li> Satisfied ((: thank you</li>
    <li> The item was not packaged carefully but the item was really very good. The lashes looked natural when worn even my husband commented that it looked good.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. I wish it had more volume, but it looks natural and just fine.</li>
    <li> These are nice lashes but they are attached to a thin ass piece of string making it impossible to attach to my eyes compared to lashes tht have a stick strip for easy attachment.</li>
    <li> Love these Lashes if you double them they look so good. :) would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love these..there so easy to put on an there comfortable they also the rite length for me..so I ordered some more for me an my friend</li>
    <li> This is just not what I expected, then again for the price I should&#x27;ve seen it coming. Their so fragile and long and just no don&#x27;t spend your money.</li>
    <li> the string is WAYYYY too thin and not supportive of the lashes; difficult to apply-- i say save your money and buy better qualities ones for a few more $$</li>
    <li> Cheap quality. I get they are cheap being around $2 but I&#x27;d rather stick w target brand and pay an extra $1 for better quality and instant service (not two whole months) before receiving.</li>
    <li> Bought these awhile ago but I love these eyelashes so I&#x27;m repurchasing. I wear them to work everyday and get so many compliments. People think that they&#x27;re my real lashes. They are thin and are a lot longer than my eye so I do have to cut them, however unlike another reviewer mine did not come off the string after being cut. That did happen once though when I yanked them out of the package. Be careful.</li>
    <li> ..took forever to arrive! They were for my girlfriend and when they finally arrived, she was soooo happy. Happy GF &#x3D; Happy BF. Five stars for the product.</li>
    <li> These are the best lashes I&#x27;ve received on Amazon so far!!  I just ordered 10 more boxes, hoping they&#x27;re exactly the same as the ones I just got!!</li>
    <li> This product is natural, beautiful, and most importantly comfortable! I have ordered qty of 20 and it is worth every penny i paid.</li>
    <li> These are very natural looking. I don&#x27;t like the ones that look fake and these are perfect.  As soon as I get my shipment of them I order more...love them!</li>
    <li> too big like for cows i put in the trash!!</li>
    <li> Ok first of all I purchased this product because of the inexpensive price. When they arrived a month later I was amazed at the quality, gorgeous natural looking lashes great for everyday use.. I gave this product 4 stars because they are a bit hard to apply. But again the price was just amazing so with that being said I don&#x27;t mind practicing.</li>
    <li> they were way too plastic looking and not what I expected at all. I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the quality</li>
    <li> I only wear eyelashes every once in awhile. And this one is really nice it looks very natural and that&#x27;s what I wanted. I actually ended up buying two more of this cause it is really affordable.</li>
    <li> came alot sooner than expected .they are just a tad to thin but alot easier to put on than any other that ive ever tried. worth the money in my opinion</li>
    <li> I love these lashes! I get so many compliments when I wear them that many think they are my real natural lashes with mascara on and curled up. They are very natural and blend in very well with your natural lashes! I love them so much I stocked up! I will be buying them again when my stock is getting low... And a good tip to achieve a more natural looking lashes is to curl them with your natural lashes after the lash glue has dried completly, and apply a little bit of mascara to blend them with your falsies and make sure when you apply your favorite mascara swivel your mascara brush left to right, since this technique will allow your falsies and natural lashes blend in better and complete a more natural lash look. Hope this helps you out! ;)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like these to be honest I look at the picture and the price and said how bad can they be. I mean the lashes aren&#x27;t terrible but they aren&#x27;t that goo either I wish the didn&#x27;t come on string then they wouldn&#x27;t be so bad</li>
    <li> I would get these lashes again they look very natural!</li>
    <li> If your package box was dent upon arrival, don&#x27;t worry, the product is still great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the box, I didn&#x27;t want to use those lashes because they didn&#x27;t seem &amp;#34;substantial&amp;#34; enough.  After I tried them on, I don&#x27;t use the others.  The next day, I ordered 10 more boxes, yes, 10.  The reasons that this is a good product are (1) price; (2) the look - extremely natural, not fakely thick and not fakely long; (3) comfort - they are the most comfortable lashes I&#x27;ve ever worn and I probably own 25 pairs other than this box.  The band is made of thread, so they are very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with this product is that it&#x27;s hard to re-use each pair for more than twice, but the price makes up for it.  The rate I&#x27;m using them, it&#x27;s costing me almost $0.20/day... (my guilty indulgence)  This is one of the few products that I don&#x27;t want to see discontinued.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll give these eyelashes 3 stars. Don&#x27;t get me wrong they look great once they are on, but it was kind of hard to get them on since they are so flimsy. You also have to be real careful not to ruin them when you&#x27;re taking them off the cardboard... they are glued on there good.</li>
    <li> I had purchased similar lashes on Amazon before, and they were decent quality. I ordered these lashes for two dollars, thinking &amp;#34;What a deal!&amp;#34; They arrived in 3 weeks, but they were flimsy and plastic. Even the packaging is different from the advertised picture. I can&#x27;t wear them, because they&#x27;re so synthetic that they shine under any kind of light. Sometimes, that&#x27;s not the kind of attention a girl wants.</li>
    <li> These falsies are long and thin (not bad or anything). They do actually look a bit natural. I like to wear them with eyeliner and just a tiny bit of mascara and they look awesome. (:</li>
    <li> Yes, perfect size, perfect perfect perfect. Price is great for what you receive, better than drug store eyelashes. They do take a while to get to you, but worth it.</li>
    <li> They look natural and pretty :-)</li>
    <li> Pretty good lashes for the cost. I used them with Duo lash glue (clear) and they stayed on really well. The reason I gave it four stars is because they were definitely too long. I don&#x27;t know anyone with a lash line that long, but they were really easy to cut down to my eye shape, so overall this was a pretty good product. I can see myself ordering more in the future. They also arrived quicker than I expected them to, which was a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> they look so so so NATURAL i have told people they are my real lashed and they actually believe it! i just LOVE them so glad i git them!!!!</li>
    <li> So these surprised me and are pretty good. I took off a star because the thread that hold the lashes is long and you have to carefully clip them on both ends. But they look natural and hold up well. I&#x27;ve been able to get four wears out of one pair.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes they are perfect!!!</li>
    <li> The band is very, very thin. As a novice with false lashes, I&#x27;m struggling with the application.Look natural but definitely&lt;br /&gt;not for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;Only one lash arrived ruined...not bad!</li>
    <li> I wish these eyelashes were fuller and much longer. On me they hardly made a difference. I would recommend for those just starting to use fake lashes. The lashes are too sparse. I am not going for a drama queen look but I wanted something to enhance or at least make a difference. It feels like I do not have any on. I wish they were curved more to make them easier to apply. I would not buy again. However, if you are going for a natural, barely there look, then these are for you. great price though and it came sooner than delivered. If they offered a more dramatic lash, I would purchase from this company.</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t like the ones in the photo. They&#x27;re really long across the lid so you have to trim the sides &amp; the lashes are laid on a thread like strip; so its kind of flimsy, which makes it difficult to put on. Once you go through the hassle of applying they do look natural(ish) so I guess they&#x27;re OK. I&#x27;d def recommend you look for better though.</li>
    <li> i bought these a couple weeks ago, yeah took awhile to come but that doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit! These lashes are amazing and natural and adjustable! love them! these might even last me the whole year! love love love!</li>
    <li> It really worthy the price</li>
    <li> They are very soft and natural looking lashes. there are a lot for the price, i would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> These eyelashes came earlier than expected. I haven&#x27;t worn them yet but they look and feel real. Package came prompt and secure.</li>
    <li> Shorter than expected but natural looking going to double them since they are thin. Giving a pair to my mom she&#x27;s going to love them since they are her size. 5 stars for people with short lashes...</li>
    <li> I love the fact that these eyelashes are natural looking! I have the shortest eyelashes so I put a pair of these on and BAM! It looks like their my own.</li>
    <li> these are light and easy to wear. however, i wanted natural looking lashes that only added some thickness to my natural lashes. these were way too long for me. they are still very nice for days you want to dress up.</li>
    <li> These work great..natural and soft</li>
    <li> Love them so much I&#x27;m ordering 10 more !!!  These are light and comfortable I can&#x27;t even feel them. They have a natural look, which I really like ....</li>
    <li> Way better than I expected. I thought they were going to be all stiff and plastic looking and they weren&#x27;t! Great for the price! What do you have to lose?</li>
    <li> I absolutely love them!! They blend natural with my eyelashes. They feel real light and with a dash of DUO glue; they stayed on all night long.</li>
    <li> Natural looking, weightless, absolutely great.  Took a long time to ship - so worth it.  I cut one in half to use in outer corners of each eye, looks less dramatic for everyday use.  I haven&#x27;t reused but I don&#x27;t see why couldn&#x27;t be.</li>
    <li> The lashes that were delivered look nothing like the ones in the picture. They look so fake; they remind me of a black version of the green decorative \\&quot;grass\\&quot; that comes in store bought sushi packs. They were cheap enough that I&#x27;ll write it off as a lesson learned.</li>
    <li> First I just ordered one box to check out the quality before ordering more. These are SO great! Extremely light and soft, and a very natural enhancement. Defnitely noticeable, but absolutely not fake looking. Very feminine and pretty. I like to trim them a bit and use them as half lashes on the outer half of my upper lids to get that sexy flirty cat-eye look without being too dramatic. Highly recommend. They come from Taiwan I think so expect about a 2-3 week ship time.</li>
    <li> I like them but I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Pros +&lt;br /&gt;-They feel just like real lashes (bend like real lashes and fix easily)&lt;br /&gt;-Good deal though, can&#x27;t beat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Cons -&lt;br /&gt;-The strip is to thin!&lt;br /&gt;-They took FOREVER to come, omg&lt;br /&gt;-They&#x27;re to wide... Had to cut them to fit my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought TWO boxes of 10 and gave one box away.</li>
    <li> These false eye lashes are Very light &amp; they&#x27;re natural looking eye lashes doesn&#x27;t feel heavy like most lashes. Love them</li>
    <li> Super natural love it ! Flexible band and doesn&#x27;t have the nasty glue on the eyelashes when you purchases it like most places .</li>
    <li> Fantastic will purchase again been a lash wearer for 30 years enjoy the price.  Very lightwieght and soft they look very natursl and you can trim to fit.  Will purchase again</li>
    <li> Nice lashes. As good as store bought, but much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Very natural looking perfect for everyday use.</li>
    <li> the lashes are not heavy at all.  They are light and natural looking.</li>
    <li> These lashes were amazing! So soft &amp; flexible made application a breeze! I had full, long beautiful lashes!&lt;br /&gt;They are very sturdy lashes &amp; I got multiple uses out of them! Even when I applied mascara on them multiple times, THEY DIDNT CLUMP!&lt;br /&gt;I seriously used these ten pairs for months! I saved so much money using these!&lt;br /&gt;So glad I stumbled upon these! Will be ordering again definitely!</li>
    <li> These came in a cute little box that had a heart shaped cut out thingy so you could what was inside. They were so comfortable and they feel and dont look too fake (thats how I wanted them I know some enjoy the pop look) . I love them and plan on getting more!</li>
    <li> There are times when you think that it can&#x27;t possibly be good at this price.  This was one of those times and the same voice that asked the question provided the answer... So good I almost feel guilty for paying this little.</li>
    <li> These are very natural and soft.  I love how they feel and look.  No glue like other lashes that come in packaging where you have to peel them off.  These are very easy to work with and have a nice, real looking feel to them.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> hard to glue on, weirdly shaped, and very thin. Just not a good pair of eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I like these because they were so cheap, which is why I gave it four stars instead of three. DO NOT buy these as a beginner. I made the mistake of buying these as my first pairs of falsies and boy was I in for it. Applying one took me 20 minutes, I kid you not. But as I got more experienced, these became easier and easier to put on. The issue is that the lashes are on YARN instead of a lashband. A lashband for those of you who don&#x27;t know, is usually clear and probably as thing as a fishing line. These yarn things are thicker and must be worn with black eyeliner because otherwise you&#x27;ll see the separation between your natural lash....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the best way to wear these is to trim a lash in half and apply the half to your outer corners for some added oomph. Love these, though for the price. So feathery.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these! They are so cheap but they look so real and natural and they look just as good as my 40 dollar pair! Will continue buying these maybe in a more dramatic look as well!</li>
    <li> when i received my package i had completly forgot about it! they took a month to get here i havent tryed them on yet but im sure they&#x27;re fine.</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re so natural looking, cheap and i wear them every day. i buy them in bulks of 5 and re order on my second to last box. will order forever!:)</li>
    <li> this product did not take too long to come. and it 10 pairs of natural eye lash like it say. if you like it thick do not order this. but you just want to thicken up your so it will stand out but look natural still get this. and you have enough so you can do it over and over 10 times.</li>
    <li> I understand that this is extremely cheap. But its not even worth spending 5cents on it.</li>
    <li> Most beautiful lashes I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
    <li> I wore them for the first time today and I&#x27;m definitely impressed. They look soft and natural, and they blend with my natural lashes nicely. The only cons I have are that one of the lashes came with a gap in it and the took about a month to recieve</li>
    <li> These lashes took forever to arrive . First you have to trim them down a lot . Second the band is crap . After putting on the first set (while getting ready for work) , I  noticed the ends would not stay in place . I used my duo glue . After another 15 minutes and my eyes are itching from the lashes . I filed 13 these things asap !!. ( trash can ). I went to my local walgreens and bought the Kiss lashes I normally wear . Hindsight : you get what you pay for. Luckily , they were only 1.25 .</li>
    <li> The eyelashes I received looked more like fake eyelashes you would see on a baby doll. They don&#x27;t even look real, more like paper. You&#x27;ll be better off just paying $2 for some good ones at walgreens</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are very nice. Although I am young, I have droopy, hooded eyelids so these do touch my eyebrow BUT I do like to take my handy-dandy scissors and trim them by a millimeter or two. They make my real lashes appear thicker and fuller, which is ultimately what I wanted out of these falsies. I am giving these a four out of five simply because I do not like how flimsy the band is, which can sometimes make it look like I don&#x27;t know how to do my eyeliner. I bought two boxes of these, and they are going last FOREVER because I have worn one pair up to five times before the glue became chunky.</li>
    <li> I ordered a pair of eyelashes from here a year ago and i really loved them, the eye lash line ( the part that holds the lashes) was made of a thread like material and they were super comfortable. So i purchased two of these thinking they were the same ones, but behold i was fooled!!! I mean the price is pretty cheap so I was super disappointed when they turned out to be super uncomfortable, but still i wished they would be more comfortable for the eye. Other than that they are super pretty/ natural so maybe if you want to cut them and use them just for the wings of your eyes then this might be a great fake lash for you, but overall this product it not worth purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes they&#x27;re not to thick and not to thin. My eyelashes are almost as long as these but they add the perfect amount of extra length and fullness. They did take awhile to ship but they&#x27;re worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I loved this product. Really soft, natural and long.</li>
    <li> I am newer to wearing lashes, and these are the 3rd I have tried. I have tried some from Crazy Cart, Ardell, and these. These are very soft and were the the easiest to put on as far as molding to your eyelid shape since they are on a thread, but even so I had trouble getting them to stay on the inner corner of my eye (I&#x27;ll blame that on being a noob.) I have almond shaped eyes, so I only needed to trim a little off of the edges. I do have hooded eyes with a lower brow bone, so the lashes touch my eye brows, but that wasn&#x27;t a problem for me. Overall I&#x27;m really happy with these, they aren&#x27;t too thick and &#x27;furry&#x27; while still adding plenty of volume and although they are a touch longer than what I was looking for, it&#x27;s not enough to be a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would compare these to Ardell 110 with a softer band, and while they aren&#x27;t exactly the same, the price difference makes up for being just a little more obvious. If you are looking for lashes that are somewhat visible but not over the top, these are them - on me you can tell they are fake (and only because of their length against my short eyelid space) but only if you are specifically looking at my eyes, they don&#x27;t make a scene from across the room. Just be sure to order 3 weeks or so before you need them since these ship from overseas.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price! thank you!</li>
    <li> Not good quality at all. Very large and floppy. I had to trim the lashes to the point that I could never get them to fit properly and they are so floppy it was impossible to put them on</li>
    <li> The lashes I receive did not look at all like the picture mine were too long and fake looking. Also they were a bit clumpy...&lt;br /&gt;cheap but not worth it.</li>
    <li> The eyelashes took to long to get delievered though they are a bit longer than expected but they were really good</li>
    <li> not bad for the price. lashes are very soft but i had to trim them on the sides because they are very long. ends are tucked under the sheet which makes it a little difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> They are great very thin natruel look i recieved it very early it got here 1 week after ordering very satisfied with the shipping. Like i said they are great they were just a little long for me but a little triming did great recomended.</li>
    <li> I never wore false eyelashes before and wow, these look amazing on me! Very natural looking. The falsies is light weight and definitely a great buy. I&#x27;m Asian if that helps, and  my eyes are not exactly small but I did trim the lash down since it was long. Again, I will definitely buy this again. Oh I also bought Revlon lash glue to make it stick. So worth it.</li>
    <li> I purchased these just to practice. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to wear these in public. I&#x27;m not complaining bc the price is wonderful, but they would look silly out</li>
    <li> It took awhile for these to arrive, since they come from Hong Kong, but they came in a week before the shipping estimation. I tried a pair on yesterday and OMG they are so natural looking and pretty. I&#x27;m soooo glad I found these! I&#x27;ll probably buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> they are synthetic of course and you have to cut to your length. they aren&#x27;t as filled as they look though which was dissapointing, but i was again just looking for a filler. I do wish they came with the glue though. The though came the very last day of the dead line which took a month and a few days. lol. they were coming from China or Japan can&#x27;t remember i have a few coming from both places.</li>
    <li> For the price they work great better then expected. They look so natural. I love them! Plus it comes with 10 pairs and each last forever if you maintain them clean.</li>
    <li> What a deal for hand tied eyelashes!!! perfect..dont waste a lot of money on lashes that are inferior to these and cost up to 20X as much</li>
    <li> They look natural and are great for the price. But the edges don&#x27;t seem to stick as well and it&#x27;s like, I can feel them every time I blink.</li>
    <li> First time I ordered this &amp; received it, shipping was a little lengthy but the product was what I ordered. I liked it so much that i decided I should stock up on them so I ordered two more boxes. Little did I know, they sent me the WRONG LASHES. Instead of the natural lashes, they sent me the thick, plastic-y, fake looking lashes. Currently in the process of contacting &amp; dealing with the seller now. When I emailed them, they asked for picture proof that I received the wrong items. Like seriously? The packaging of the two lashes are COMPLETELY different &amp; you can clearly see through the box &amp; tell they are NOT natural looking...why even send it?</li>
    <li> Lashes were not what i expected it. Cant even wear them. Waste of money.i would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I will order more since it is cheap. I wish it had a glue that comes with this eyelashes. I will definately buy it</li>
    <li> I gave these lashes 5 stars because they arrived on time and actually a little earlier than the estimated arrival date. The lashes were a little long for my eyes but they were easy to trim and apply after the trim. I also had to remove the excess string on both ends of the lashes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only when one pair so far, but the day I did, I was so pleased! They worked with the lash glue I have, so no problems there. I trimmed the ends(where the lash stops) and applied, and they look so natural and beautiful! I was really feeling myself. Another pro, is that, with most lashes, you can wear one pair more than once as long as you remove the old glue from them first, SO $1 IS AN AMAZING PRICE FOR 10 PAIRS!!! These look very natural, they aren&#x27;t stiff: very flexible, and bend to shape your lash line. They&#x27;re not dramatically thick, or overly long. I think they&#x27;re perfect, especially coming from someone with little to no lashes, lol.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product at all waste of time, waste of money even for a cheap price. Never again.</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are great! They look natural and go great with any look natural&lt;br /&gt;Or you can add mascara to enhance the look will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I wear false eyelashes as part of my regular beauty routine and I LOVE these. They look natural, are easy to apply, and are super affordable. I am a frequent buyer of them and will continue to stay that way.</li>
    <li> These are so natural looking and I don&#x27;t need to cut them since my eyes are so big lol I will definitely buy these again</li>
    <li> I use them so much I love how they add to my face without looking fake. they blend in like if they were my true lashes love it for the every day look.</li>
    <li> I got this item within 2 weeks, so that&#x27;s pretty fast considering it shipped internationally. Many complained about their packaging getting all squished and damaging the lashes, but mine was delivered without flaw. The lashes, like most, are longer than your normal eye so it is necessary to trim them, which isn&#x27;t a problem since everyone&#x27;s eye is different. The lashes themselves are very pretty and pretty natural looking - I wear them everyday to school without problem. Would recommend, especially for the price! I get 2-3 wears for each lash. Super cheap and good for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I got these lashes VERY early and I must say that these deserve a 5/5! They&#x27;re very soft and natural looking, but if I want something dramatic then I double them up. I would suggest these for anyone looking for simple everyday lashes to wear to school, work, etc.</li>
    <li> I will order these in large quantities, I love them so much! I would recommend these to anyone who want false eyelashes, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t aware that these are practically a piece of thread with lashes. Don&#x27;t like them at all!!</li>
    <li> Theses lashes are great if your going for the natural look. And if you use the Individual clue the last a long time. These lashes are the next best secret.</li>
    <li> Love these! Very natural looking</li>
    <li> There are to thin and flimsy.</li>
    <li> Love these, light as a feather, great quality..good buy I would recommend these to others you won&#x27;t be disappointed..AA+ great</li>
    <li> At first I was disappointed, because when I put these lashes on they were really the same length as my original eyelashes without mascara, I thought what a waste sense I bought 2 packs at that. I t didn&#x27;t dawn on me to apply mascara to the eyelashes, when I did that the lashes was longer than my natural lashes with mascara. which my natural lash is already long with mascara but these lashes with mascara was perfect! I hope that makes sense....love these will purchase again. Thanks for fast shipping got them in like 2 wks or 3 wks at most! In the packaging was supper duper cute I didn&#x27;t even want to open the box.......a must have</li>
    <li> great deal for the price. super long and pretty! however i would not recommend for people that dont have experience putting on lashes aa they can be kind of hard to work with. but amazing lashes for the price you pay and with decently quick shipping!</li>
    <li> I like them because they are simple and not long, I can use them in the day time when I don&#x27;t wanna put mascara on, without looking too exaggerated. Because of this reason i like them.  However I hate that a couple of hour of wearing them it will star &amp;#34;unglueing&amp;#34; off the eye.  I&#x27;ve used falsies for a long time and I&#x27;ve used the same glue and this the first time that it happens. So for sure it&#x27;s not the glue.</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering these lashes and I love them so much that I ordered five boxes! They are pretty good quality, have a three base and when trimmed to fit they look glamour, I personally trim the tops of them to make them look more natural to wear daily, the price is unbeatable. Maybe would not suggest for beginners just because of the amount of trimming. I use the 217&#x27;s. Can be worn two or three times if clean properly after each use. Sh for free and take a few weeks to arrive, but it&#x27;s well worth it for me. The only downside is that they are in cardboard time boxes and my carrier crush the package so the boxes don&#x27;t quite close properly, will buy frequently!</li>
    <li> Real beautiful lashes and they look real. Apply nicely with revolt lash adhesive. Would buy again, great price awesome item</li>
    <li> Super soft. I had to trim mine a bit but no complaints.</li>
    <li> they look nice and you get a lot its just you have to tirm them at the end so that theyre no that long</li>
    <li> They arrived quick, they were not the same ones that i saw in pics, and ordered, but its actually not a problem since these were very nice.  I will probably order more.</li>
    <li> The shipping did take a little bit longer but they were worth the wait. very soft very natural and real feeling not heavy at all. def a must buy.</li>
    <li> Works well. Need to use clear lash glue if you use black it&#x27;s awkward. :)</li>
    <li> Came two weeks before the initial date of arrival! Easy to apply. Would order again in bulk! I love the way they wear! I&#x27;m a beginner so it took practice but I got it!</li>
    <li> Bang for your buck. These are my favorite style and not too dramatic or over done. They blend nicely and feel comfy. You cannot beat the price. Never will I buy brands like ardell or drug store lashes again - those are a rip off compared to these!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t even tried these I can already tell they are going to be too flimsy and hard to apply and keep on.</li>
    <li> I got the eyelashes today and ordered them about a week ago, they arrived a week early and look really nice and natural. Not too thin and not too thick.</li>
    <li> Looks natural...  With that price you can afford to use a new one every time.  Although shipping took a long time considering its coming from Hong Kong. But I am glad I ordered. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Handmade, false eyelash haven&#x27;t worn, but a see will know that is very natural, I don&#x27;t like heavy make-up, so the style suit me very well.</li>
    <li> Very thin eyelashes, not noticeable wen I wear them. Very natural I guess.</li>
    <li> I have tried eyelashes from stores, always felt they were overly flimsy, easily damaged, looked crazy instead of natural, or they peeled up and fell off. Being someone who hasn&#x27;t worn false eyelashes frequently, under $5 for 10 pairs was a bargain. These are great, better quality then any I&#x27;ve purchased from a store, stayed on every time worn, reusable, &amp; look natural. If I was to give anyone tips I&#x27;d tell them to buy these, watch a few tutorials on-line about how to correctly apply them, brush them out a little before applying to separate &amp; soften them, be gentle while handling them, and then get some really good glue, the brand I think works the very best is Duo.</li>
    <li> They were too thin and in the photo they appear thicker and darker. You would have to glue about 2 or 3 of them to get the look you want. The price was great but not worth the hassle that will come wearing the lashes to me.</li>
    <li> Lord, I love these so much. They&#x27;re are the epitome of perfect. I&#x27;m 16 &amp; I wear makeup, I love long eyelashes but I hate the thick ones ( the ones that look extremely fake) they&#x27;re are nice &amp; light. Sometimes I forget I&#x27;m wearing them, the little thing it came in was kinda weird lol they&#x27;re taped down. That&#x27;s the only minor flaw.</li>
    <li> The eyelashes I got in the mail aren&#x27;t even the ones in the picture! I absolutely hate them , their thick and you cant even wear them ! Im so disappointed. Such a waste. Do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> Due to a temporary loss of my own lashes (not a total loss, but they are very, very short just now) it is necessary for me to wear false eyelashes.  Until this happened about a month ago, I&#x27;d only worn them once, and they were put on by a make up artist, so I&#x27;ve had to learn a lot on my own.  I really have benefited from the product reviews that other women have posted on Amazon and am so grateful for the help.  That is why i wanted to share my experience here.  I am looking to have natural lashes, perhaps with the best mascara application on, not to be glamorous or obvious or as evening wear.  That alone eliminates a lot of the options here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These lashes are quite nice.  The hair is very soft, as is the band onto which it is attached.  They are a bit longer than I would like, as they nearly touch my brows, but that is a common problem with false eye lashes.  In experimenting with different types and different brands, I&#x27;ve learned the advantages and disadvantages of each.  Soft banded lashes like these are very comfortable to wear because there is no stiff corner to poke you when blinking.  On the other hand, when the band is so soft and flexible it can make it a bit more difficult to place the lash securely against the edge of your eyelid by pushing gently on the lash tips themselves or on the band.  It can tend to shift or move, whereas lashes that have a stiffer band can be more easily nudged against the edge of the lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip I can offer is to let the adhesive set up for a good 20-30 seconds.  You want it to be tacky or sticky and not &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; when placed against the lid so it will &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34;.  I tend not to wait long enough, and when the adhesive is wet it just won&#x27;t &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;.  These lashes do not come with any adhesive, by the way.  There is adhesive in black, white, and clear.  I tend to favor the white.  It will generally dry reasonably invisibly, but if you need to you can always use some virtually black eyeshadow powder and a very skinny slanted brush to gently dab along the lash strip as an &amp;#34;eyeliner&amp;#34; to fill in any gaps between the lash strip and your own lashes, or to cover up any adhesive that may be showing.  One problem with clear adhesive, I&#x27;ve discovered much to my surprise, is that it is impossible to tell where you&#x27;ve applied it to the lash strip, how thickly it has been applied, and while it sounds like a good idea, I&#x27;ve stopped using the clear one I bought as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an experiment I also bought these lashes, which come in a pack of 10 pairs as well.  [[ASIN:B007PY4QV8 New Thin 10 Pair Natural Black Long Fake False Eyelashes Eye Lash Makeup]]  They appeared to be identical to the ones I&#x27;m reviewing here, and they arrived today, from Hong Kong.  I can say that the packages look identical, the lashes also look identical, and the labels on the packages are identical.  So if you want to save a little bit of money and can wait for them to arrive, go ahead and give these a try.  For under $3 for 10 pairs, how can you lose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These lashes can be reused, and with care you can probably get 2-3-4 wearings out of them.  They are basically disposable, but i would say that you don&#x27;t have to toss them after one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this problem (needing to wear false eyelashes) developed, I was traveling in Europe.  I found the UK brand Eylure to have the best, most natural looking lashes, but they are very hard to find here in the US.  One of the &amp;#34;Naturalites&amp;#34; line of Eylure is available here on Amazon: [[ASIN:B000ORSICQ Eylure Naturalites Natural Volume - 020 - Adhesive Included]]  They do come with a tiny bottle of adhesive, and I&#x27;ve taken to carrying one in my purse at all times for emergency re-gluing.  These particular lashes are very fine, have variable length, like natural lashes, and certainly look the most &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;.  Because they are so fine they are particularly fragile so take care and you may be able to get 2-3 wearingsout of them.  They are also $6.99 each pair, so are much more expensive than certainly either of these two sets of ten pairs are, and more than the Ardell brand lashes that are commonly available in the US.  In the UK there are several very subtle &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; styles by Eylure, but regrettably are not available here that I can find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Ardell &amp;#34;demure&amp;#34; lashes are available on Amazon as a single pair or in this pack of four pairs for $14.76. [[ASIN:B003ZS1OCW Ardell Fashion Lashes Pair - Demure (Pack of 4)]]  They are fuller than the Eylure, but not as long as the lashes in the 10 pair pack mentioned above. The description on Amazon says &amp;#34;they may be reused up to three weeks&amp;#34;.  Balderdash.  I&#x27;ve not come across any brand of lash that could possible be worn for 10+ hours a day, every day, for three weeks! They are very nice subtle lashes, and seem to be somewhat more durable than the Eylure.  I like them quite a bit, so see what you think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one of the helpful reviews I&#x27;ve read here on Amazon about lashes a reviewer mentioned Headcovers.com, a website for women with hair loss from cancer.  She praised the clear adhesive that they sell (note my comment above about that) but when I went there I discovered some other false eyelashes to try and ordered two pair - one their #100 Basic Layered Eyelash ($4.99 plus shipping) and the other was on sale - #206 Criss Cross Low Volume lashes for $2.99.  I&#x27;ve not yet tried the first pair, but the Criss Cross one turns out to be one of my favorites.  I thought the criss cross lashes would look artificial but I&#x27;m assured they don&#x27;t.  They are 100% human hair, the lashes are longer than I&#x27;d optimally like, and the band they are attached to is stiffer and looks like black eyeliner when I wear them.  But once you get the band a bit more flexible by wearing or by gently rolling them around a finger to make it softer, I&#x27;ve found that because the band IS stiff it is a bit easier to place correctly.  With tacky adhesive it is easy to gently press down on the lash tips to put some gentle pressure on the lash band to adhere to my lid.  I was surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there are some days that both lashes go on just right the first time and I&#x27;m out the door, and others when one or the other (or both!) just will not seat properly and I&#x27;m frustrated and run late for work or whatever appointment I have that day.  I never know how it will turn out.  But it does get easier with practice.  And I think that by the time I&#x27;m very adept with them my own lashes will have grown in enough that with some favorite mascara, I&#x27;ll be good to go.  Or maybe I&#x27;ll decide that I love wearing false eyelashes every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I hope this has been helpful.

Thanks to all of you who took the time to write in about other similar products.  I couldn&#x27;t have done this without you!</li>
    <li> These eyelashes look great. They are light weight and look very natural.  I would definitely re-order them again. Not too thick but very natural look.</li>
    <li> I ordered these lashes and was so happy and surprised.  They are economical and the best lashes I have used.  They are not super thick or too thin.  They bend easily for application and look very natural.  I use false lashes just about every day, and these are good quality and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  The glue comes off easily and with gentle care, I have been able to reuse the same lashes about four times.  I was very happy with this product and would order them again.</li>
    <li> They are made out of plastic and you can tell. It&#x27;s not the fake hair kind of plastic. It&#x27;s more of: they had sheets of plastic and they stamp cut a whole set of eyelashes out of them... just a little sad. However they are very soft, not as soft as the regular kind but still soft.</li>
    <li> I bought these lashes and the first time I applied them,I wasn&#x27;t so sure. If you are going for a very natural,long wisp of a lash,then that&#x27;s what you can achieve with these. I personally go for a more smokey eye with fuller lashes,so what I did is run 2 coats of thickening mascara and they puffed up! If you curl them with a lash curler you can tone down the length a little bit by putting a curl further down the lash.I think I&#x27;ll use them without the mascara when I just want a simple makeup look and then with mascara for more drama.I personally like running mascara through falsies anyways,not just to blend but I like the mascara look.These seem to hold mascara nicely.**The reason I gave only 4 stars is because the band is so tiny,it can be tricky to put them on.The band is actually the string they are sewn on so be careful when cutting them to size or the thread will fray a bit.You can always just dab extra glue on the ends to seal the thread.Hope this helps!! Be beautiful..stay beautiful!!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical when I purchased these false lashes , but surprisingly they are very good. Also, they came fast. I like them ! Not love , but definitely like them &#x27;. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> Love these but def not for beginners.</li>
    <li> WOW I am loving these lashes because they are so light and natural!  I cut mine in half, snip the string off the end and then apply with my clear LashGrip adhesive.  The lashes stay put all day and night.  These are inexpensive which is great for every day lash wearers.  Even the color is natural, not too black but not brown in any way just a nice light black.  They are very wispy and light, can&#x27;t even tell they are on my eyes.</li>
    <li> I just recived my eyelashes 3 days ago and they are nice thin but really cute.I cant wait to try them on.</li>
    <li> They were very flimsy and they held no shape what-so-ever. They also required A LOT of trimming. But after cutting them and fighting for them to hold shape, they looked somewhat natural. I advise you guys to invest in some Revlon brand eyelashes which are my favorite.</li>
    <li> Love these eyelashes they are so thin they look so natural I had to order more love them !!!! Thank you</li>
    <li> When i first ordered these i was really excited because I&#x27;ve never really tried wearing lashes before and i wanted to give it a go. But when i received them from the mail i realized that they didn&#x27;t look the same as the picture. the ones i received were HUGE and extremely fake looking. i would seriously consider returning them but its not worth the five dollars. If i were you i would NOT BUY THESE LASHES. YOU MAY NOT GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR!</li>
    <li> This eyelashes look very natural but are a little small i don&#x27;t like eyelashes so big so this are good for me but not for someone who wants something bigger, quality is good, they stay all day long almost nobody noticed i had false eyelashes.</li>
    <li> The lashes are cute but not what I ordered. They look long and spiky and somewhat sparse but that is the style of them-- they don&#x27;t look bad at all.</li>
    <li> excellent value and fast shipping. Well packaged and arrived in perfect shape.  Lashes are easy to apply and look very natural.  I ordered these after wearing the extensions for almost a year and loosing the majority of my natural lashes. Between these and latisee I hope to be back to normal soon.  :-)</li>
    <li> I was happy with my first 2 orders.  However, with the last one where I ordered 5 packages, I was not shipped the same product.  They were plastic material lashes that did not look natural at all.</li>
    <li> These are amazing! Gorgeous , and so cheap! Very impressed,  usually i buy expensive ones but i decided to try these and definitely do NOT regret it</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast, I loved the look, they&#x27;re super cute and they&#x27;re very comfortable and stay well. I&#x27;m super pleased! I&#x27;m very happy! Thank you thank you!</li>
    <li> The first two orders of this product from a different distributor was excellent but this particular distributor&#x27;s quality of false lashes looked like plastic and unnatural.</li>
    <li> I love them s&amp;uacute;per natural! Just add mascara to thicken them out and they look amazing! And love how it&#x27;s extra longer on the sides makes it easier to apply!</li>
    <li> looks real eyelashes good stuff</li>
    <li> I put these lashes on everyday along with my make-up.  Don&#x27;t have to wear mascara and worry about it running down your face, or black eyes when you go to bed.  Just pull them off and use them again the next day.</li>
    <li> Lets get to it:&lt;br /&gt;PROS...&lt;br /&gt;-It arrived in two weeks as opposed to a month.&lt;br /&gt;-They looked beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;-The package was a little smooshed but it had NO effect on the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;-I prefer natural looking lashes so these went well with my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;-last long when treated right&lt;br /&gt;-No ones pointed them out.&lt;br /&gt;-The price&lt;br /&gt;CONS...&lt;br /&gt;-The lashes were built into the box. You literally have to gently cut out the bottom of the box and slowly peel the eyelash ends away from the sides and center.&lt;br /&gt;-OR rip them out and risk fraying the sides permanently.&lt;br /&gt;-No glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 100% satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered one of the natural pairs (3 of them) and was very excited for the cost. Shipped in little Taiwan packaging, they appeared to be in good condition and quality. The only reason this product was rated so low is because of the actual &#x27;band&#x27; where the lashes are connected. It is literally a soft thread and hard to apply. Very hard to. And also, when with my Lash Grip adhesive glue, the lashes fell off shortly after by the corners. I would not buy these again and have rendered them useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Kayla xx</li>
    <li> did not like the style of these or how they felt plastic.thank god they were so cheap and I didn&#x27;t waste money. I prefer Revlon false lashes or redcherry.</li>
    <li> I have never purchased these before so i am new to them but the eyelashes seem real and I think i got a bargain for sure.</li>
    <li> You get what you part for. Very stiff and doesn&#x27;t remain in place when glued.</li>
    <li> Love the lashes. I do have to cut them everytime I use a new pair, b/c they&#x27;re a bit wide for me, but it&#x27;s nice b/c I can customize them if i  use them on friends.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone always compliments me on how nice my lashes look and don&#x27;t even realize they&#x27;re fake!&lt;br /&gt;I do wish the band was a tiny bit thinner but no one ever notices. A little liquid eye liner helps blend them in</li>
    <li> These lashes are extremely lightweight on the eyes and look and feel natural. Please keep in mind that you will have to trim them because they are attached to a very thin thread. I do not recommend these if you are a novice. Other falsies have a band that you can manipulate to contour to your eye and these do not because they are attached to a string/thread which should not be a problem for more experienced people.</li>
    <li> Awful. They&#x27;re horrible! I decided I wante  to try false eyelashes for the first and tried these the actual lashes fel off the band. And the band is way too flexible!</li>
    <li> I have to trim them quite a bit but they look great on.</li>
    <li> to thin to form..glue went every where. dont buy these if you have fat fingers. so only one star. k</li>
    <li> Decent enough to continue to do business witht them.. They&#x27;re just like the images..</li>
    <li> These lashes are great.  Waiting for the right occasion to wear them.  Although the seem a little hard to apply.  Would have been better if they came with an adhesive.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these eyelashes they are so natural and thin this is my first time applying and wearing false lashes and the Final look is great!! I will be ordering more soon these will be the only lashes that I wear!</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t even stuck.  You have to have a very steady hand to glue yourself</li>
    <li> Eh there ok for the price .</li>
    <li> I had super high hopes for these based on other reviews, but they are just okay. They are tied onto the package, so you must cut them off, which is awkward. They are super long and definitely need to be trimmed. I personally wouldn&#x27;t wear them without putting mascara on them, as they are very thin. Maybe that makes them look more natural for others? The lash length was good, and they are flexible to put on. They simply look cheap... Which they were!</li>
    <li> These are such poor quality and look so cheap! They look like they&#x27;re made of plastic. They are not the least bit flexible.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I just wanted some for everyday use and didn&#x27;t want to pay too much. I would recommend if you have the time to put them on and conceal them properly with eyeliner, because they are pretty flexible and don&#x27;t have a fake shiny look.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I think these are just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; is because the band at the base is very thick and if you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t have too much time in the morning to mess with eyeliner, I would not recommend. Other than that they are flexible and I don&#x27;t exactly recall how long it took for them to arrive, but it was not too long (within the estimated time). I ordered style #216.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these, they&#x27;re incredibly inexpensive, but i love the way it was made. Personally, I love fake eyelashes, but I don&#x27;t like them to be &#x27;&#x27;too fake, or too plastic&#x27;&#x27;, the whole reason why i wear eye lashes is to make my eyes pop with out look like I&#x27;m trying too hard. They look so natural and long, they&#x27;re just my perfect definition to eyelashes. I already bought a second pair that should be arriving within next month. But if you&#x27;re looking for really natural long lashes these are the perfect for you! Just sucks the wait for it :( will be buying more soon!</li>
    <li> I layer them to make them a little thicker and it still looks quite natural. They are easy to trim. I recommend rolling the band with your fingers a few times before putting them on so it is prepared to stick to the curve of your eye. Else, sometimes, the ends lift up.</li>
    <li> These look so natural . The strip is very fine sometimes I forget I have a pair on they look so real, they blend GREAT with the natural lash. However was a bit long waiting for delivery but I am very satisfied with product an will be purchaceing more. THANX</li>
    <li> Great, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> they look almost natural and i love how they look they are very cheap will continue to buy them in the future</li>
    <li> I purchased these for $1.19 (I&#x27;d already bought some of these, but I couldn&#x27;t pass up the price, so I ordered more) The package arrived well before the projected date, undamaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not very fond of the thick, dramatic lashes so these natural lashes suit me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, quality and great shipping, I&#x27;d order this over and over again.</li>
    <li> Actually, these are some of the best lashes I have used!!! They are lightweight and it seems as if you are wearing nothing at all.  They give your eyes a glamorous look when dressing up and they kick your natural look up a notch without any makeup. I love them; they blend right in perfectly!!!! They shipped pretty fast (about 2 weeks before i received them).  Everyone is getting these for Christmas!</li>
    <li> I tried these on and I looked a hot mess. They were so over-the-top that when I stepped out of the bathroom my friends laughed. I mean, I&#x27;ve worn falsies before but this was just too much.  , it&#x27;s diffrent with the picture.</li>
    <li> Ordered some eyelashes from sannysis they took a while due to there location but it was worth the wait nice package they came in lashes were bountiful good hairs will order again sannysis. Tinka moore thanks</li>
    <li> I know I ordered these from abroad and paid next to nothing for them but they definitely missed a step on the assembly line.  They are very lightweight which I like but I have yet to trust them to stay in place for long periods of time without an excessive amount of DUO.</li>
    <li> I am learning how to use fake lashes, so I knew I would be using a whole bunch until I got the hang of it, so I was able to get this pack of 10 lashes for such a cheap price.  I also liked that they were not so thick and fake looking. they have a natural look to them. It did take almost a month to arrive though...</li>
    <li> Very natural and enough of them to practice with. I have bought these a few times and so inexpensive that I can practice with them and not worry if I mess up a few</li>
    <li> They look so fake. I wasted my money. They do not look like natural lashes. I gave them to my 9 year old to play dress up.</li>
    <li> So cute and so natural. All I need to do is trim a tiny bit off of the length of the lash to better fit my eye but besides that, they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
    <li> This one came, I liked it. It is a great buy, cheap but you have to wait long for it.</li>
    <li> i really done like it. i got them thinking about my eye shape. they are extremely hard to put on, and they get destroyed quickly.</li>
    <li> Perfect for people with thin eyelashes. Gives you that natural look. I completely love it. I recommend to anyone with thin eyelashes.</li>
    <li> It was a good product looked just like the picture. It took a little longer than expected to come through mail.</li>
    <li> The lashes I got were stiff, crushed from delivery, uncomfortable and WAY TOO FAKE LOOKING. not happy... but since it was only couple dollars, didn&#x27;t really expect too much... couple dollars wasted and lesson learned. DISAPPOINTED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-this from other person&lt;br /&gt;and i totally agree with it...&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even use it...</li>
    <li> Very long and don&#x27;t look very natural too me. That&#x27;s the only con is that they don&#x27;t look natural other than that they&#x27;re great</li>
    <li> Product is okay, not so great.  Does appear somewhat fake and not all natural, after all it&#x27;s false lashes!  I might consider bying more in the future</li>
    <li> These look very natural when trimmed properly. The price makes these lashes irresistible. They come in a super cute box too :3</li>
    <li> They look and feel so damn fake. Don&#x27;t buy these, its a waste of money and anticipation. Its as simple as that.</li>
    <li> I do like the eyelashes but they&#x27;re different than what I&#x27;m used to. The part to hold all of the eyelashes together and glue them to your upper lid is made out of string which I am not familiar with. They also do not include eyelash glue. Overall they are well made eyelashes I am just not used to them yet.</li>
    <li> THEIR GOOD BUT THEY LOOK TO MUCH LIKE PLASTIC AND TOO LONG FOR MY EYES  SINCE THEY ARE SMALL AND I HAVE TO CUT THEM AND THEY LOOK OK</li>
    <li> These are really soft i had to snip off a small to fit my eyes perfectly. However, there worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Recently I began wearing false eye-lashes because I lost all me through chemo. False eye-lashes can be expensive, so I bought these due to their price. The line or backing that the glue gets applied to is sort of thick. Also as the picture indicates the lashes are fairly large and far apart. For the price they are certainly okay. I do not wear for special events, but I do wear them for everyday activities. Hope this is a helpful review.</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE, DO NOT BUY! THESE ARE CHEAP PLASTIC LASHES. THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC! WISH I COULD RETURN BUT IT WOULD COST MORE THAN THEY ARE WORTH!!</li>
    <li> You get what you paid for. Plastic and supers stiff.</li>
    <li> Good shipping cane early. Te eyelashes are very easy to put on. The length is a little long just need a little trimming but that was easy. Great price, if youre looking for a natural look well these dont have that really. They are good if you have another pair of eyelashes to double them &amp; make them look fuller. I like these if I double them (:</li>
    <li> These lashes are so long and they are absolutely beautiful really wonderful I really love them so pretty perfect for my cosplays</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are amazing! The strip is thin and the lashes look natural. So if you&#x27;re wanting a natural look these bad boys are for you! They last long, and are reusable. The price for these eyelashes are a steal! Of course if you want them thicker, you can always add mascara. I always purchase these bad boys. I wear them daily because my eyelashes are naturally short. Wearing mascara doesn&#x27;t help me, so I always wear falsies. I highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> this will be my second time ordering and I really love him natural when you put them onso if you&#x27;d like to looknatural when you worry I would definitely recommend this to youlove it</li>
    <li> not great but not bad,,,, they are work-able... for the price i cant be mad. it didnt take too long to get either</li>
    <li> These are clearly made of plastic. They aren&#x27;t very comfortable on but I gave three stars because they do blend really well. I got my package pretty quick, only a 5 day wait.</li>
    <li> The strip is super thin which is perfect if you have experience you cant even tell that they&#x27;re not yours if your a beginner I would not get them.</li>
    <li> Its lame, i wasted my money</li>
    <li> Impossible to fit to the shape of your eye. They are just a straight line of lashes and you end up with glue all over the place!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get my order as soon as a&lt;br /&gt;I expected but worth what I paid for .. i love them will Definitely continue ordering them</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I liked the lashes and the prompt service, but there is a slight downfall...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are little tails at the end of the lashes that you have to snip off and they are glued to the package, so it&#x27;s hard to not damage the hairs as you pull them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were super long, so I had to trim them to fit my eyes...which is pretty normal when buying falsies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with them. They are light, flexible, and look natural. I can&#x27;t wait to try them on! I recommend these to anyone that wears lashes often. Buying in bulk is the way to go. The price is right and this particular brand gave me what I wanted. I will order from them again.</li>
    <li> they are nice and pretty subtle which is good. i wish they were a little more shorter on the inner corner though for a more natural look and feel but it&#x27;s still nice.</li>
    <li> I love them. :) It took a while to get here but they&#x27;re perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t get ripped off</li>
    <li> They are natural looking, but for my small eyes, they&#x27;re too long which takes away from them looking any natural. If you have larger eyes, maybe these&#x27;ll work for you, give it a shot! They were packaged in a mailing envelope with bubble wrap. Bubble wrap is always a plus for me! Though I have had a previous order with 2 in an envelope which crumpled up the box and a few lashes. The band in which the hair is on is almost like a coated thread which makes the bands soooo flexible and easy to apply. However because the band isn&#x27;t a thicker more plastic like material, it makes cleaning more difficult than other lashes. Hope this review helped, and answered some questions. (:</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how these lashes got any good reviews.  I am a pretty easy to please girl.  Quite frankly these are garbage.  I know that you get what you pay for and sure... go ahead and try them out for a buck, no big deal.  But you could also give that dollar to a bum and that bum could at least get something of the dollar menu... Yea I would recommend that route.</li>
    <li> These go on really easy and look very natural. They are soft when putting on which is great because the last pair I got from a different brand where pretty hard every time i blinked my eyes. So these are nice!</li>
    <li> What a great buy1  I was purchasing individual sets for as much as this 10 set cost me. They were perfect. Took time to get here, they come from China!  But now I order them well in advance.  Great item.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> YES ! THEY ARE LITERALLY ON A BLACK STRING !!! I had a lil difficulty playing with them, but after a few trys...I&#x27;m enjoying them!</li>
    <li> Terrible quality Didn&#x27;t even use them...never again</li>
    <li> Took a while to get here but they were definitely worth the wait! :) going to be ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> I love them ! They are so natural looking and they are super easy to apply ! I&#x27;m so happy I bought them !</li>
    <li> . .  ..I over love lashes but winn I apply this set sometimes I have to wear lke ((2or3))set @ a time cuz they are thin..but if i jus want dat clean simply freash look lke for church or work i jus apply one set ad hit them up with a lil light mascara ....jus to make My Chinese eyes POP...really i lke em they are soft ad the band are thin too dats a plus to me but if u only want dat natural look then Yess u can get jiggy with Em...soo yea they gud money u will lke em trust they are just lke the lashes at your local beauty store ..but just really really cheaper on  here.dnt get it twisted mommies  ..</li>
    <li> Very natural, long beautiful eyelashes</li>
    <li> I bought these as a person who uses fake eyelashes pretty regularly. Style 0 was the one i purchased and it looked just like the picture, the only thing that is weird about these lashes is that they are made on string. Like a little pieces of twine and when you pull to get the lash you are separating it from the string. This made the lashes a bit harder to put on, but still it hid them better. For the price totally worth it.</li>
    <li> The band is made of thick plastic, and it makes application really difficult.</li>
    <li> Love how inexpensive and natural these are! With these, I don&#x27;t need to spend big money to the the right look!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know where all these bad reviews are coming from but these lashes are really great! I bought Style 0 and it looks more full then picture looks. It looks really real and the hair on the lashes feel real as well. LADIES, IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO PUT ON FALSIES, SEPHORA HAS FREE BEAUTY LASHES. Don&#x27;t mislead people by giving this product 1 star because YOU don&#x27;t know how to put on false lashes.-_-. They look so real and I love them for the price. I think I&#x27;ll buy this every 2 weeks because for less than $2, t&#x27;s well worth fabulous lashes everyday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping wise: It took 10 days I believe which is a bit long but hey, I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
    <li> They look real. grest buy. I should have ordered more than one because now my Mom wants them.</li>
    <li> It says natural soft lashes but is more kind of plastic lashes.... They still work but are way too extremely long for me to wear ( they touch my eyebrows with them on)</li>
    <li> They were kinda worth the wait. They&#x27;re not perfect but I like them because they look like my own eyelashes. They&#x27;re a little too thin, and I feel if I pull to hard trying to take them out they&#x27;re just gonna rip out. I was used to wearing a little more dramatic ones but I&#x27;m so used to wearing these now , they&#x27;re comfortable. I had purchased these since my own eyelashes came off and I would so purchase more. I also reccomend if you like a super natural look.</li>
    <li> They did not stay on at all . Made of some kind of cheap fabric and it took so long to get.Never buying this again.</li>
    <li> Great deal.&lt;br /&gt;Came pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;The lashes are nice and soft. Perfect for those &amp;#34;u can&#x27;t tell but im wearing fake eyelashes&amp;#34; lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Got many good comments :)</li>
    <li> these eyelashes are a good value for the price! the only flaw is they are glued on back so u have to cut them loose. But i trim my eyelashes anyway so the tiny amount doesnt matter.they are lightweight and flexible. which i like.</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are good for casual use only.</li>
    <li> I love these lashed, easy to put on and last all day they even look natural!</li>
    <li> Thought it was to good to be true, turns out I was right. These things are horrible. They dont come out of package easy and hold and twist so much its hard to use them even if I wanted too. I tried to take a pair out and hated them so much I didnt bother putting them on I just threw them away.</li>
    <li> I waited over a month and a half for these eyelashes, only to receive them and have them literary fall apart when I tried to apply them!!&lt;br /&gt; I read ALL the supposed positive reviews and cannot \\&quot;figure\\&quot; out where they got their lashes from?!?! $%&amp;&amp;--%&amp;::;&#x27;!&#x27;:;??!?!????&lt;br /&gt; I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these at any price!!  I&#x27;m sooooooooo disappointed beyond belief! DO NOT ORDER THESE LASHES!!!  TRUST ME, they&#x27;re awful, and that&#x27;s truly being nice!!!!  :°(</li>
    <li> product came as described. The only bummer is there is no way to return the lashes shape,  so they&#x27;re kind of one use only :/ Still pleased with them though.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t order from this company! I ordered these lashes and I never received them. Instead, I received some kind of nail art that I cannot use. I emailed the company and they simply told me that I was mistaken. Are you kidding me? I know they were cheap and all but it was the principle. So, I would not recommend them at all. Instead of them just sending out a pack of these horrible lashes, they tried to argue with me. They can keep their cheap lashes because I will NEVER order from them again and I would suggest that you click on another company for your purchase. It doesn&#x27;t matter the amount, spend your coins on a company that deserves it!</li>
    <li> These look so real and fit so much better than anything I have purchased so far.  I love wearing these.</li>
    <li> As a true blonde, my lashes are nearly invisible.  These falsies look great and arent overly thick or fake looking. I wouldnt say natural. These are exceptional for the price!</li>
    <li> Great price and work just as well if not better as the expensive ones in store. since they are threaded together, they are more flexible and easier to put on than others I have tried, however the lashes are a bit long and tend to tickle when I blind while wearing them. They also need to be trimmed to size as they seem to have been made longer lengthwise to accommodate people with larger eyes. I find trimming like a half centimeter from each end works well.</li>
    <li> Of all the things that I bought I didnt like this one too much but I need some fake cheap lashes, but now that I have them in my hands I loooove them.. so natural they are perfect for natural looks and If you want a more bold look just use 2 in each eye.. so awesome :)</li>
    <li> These lashes are a great length and fullness. They are light weight. Unfortunately, each pair can only be used once or twice. They don&#x27;t come with glue either.</li>
    <li> i never got this product :( i was waiting for them quite a while i was looking foward on working with the fake eye lashes</li>
    <li> They came quick there&#x27;s a lot for so cheap can&#x27;t complain but they are hard to put on cause its thread :( I&#x27;d rather spend a couple more dollars and buy the ones that are easier to apply.....but I got my dollars worth lol</li>
    <li> These are nice, &amp;#34;normal-looking&amp;#34; lashes, not the over-the-top thick, long black ones.  I ordered five boxes.  The band is sturdy enough to glue easily and they look great.  It takes a while for them to ship from China but price is outstanding,  Two pair cost at least $5 in a drugstore.  These are great for everyday use if you have very thin lashes or can&#x27;t use mascara.  I love them.</li>
    <li> I have to trim mine to fit my eye. I can still feel them though. They didn&#x27;t come with glue. They don&#x27;t really add anything to my lashes. They are almost the same length to my natural lashes. :^/ I guess they could add volume to someone else? But mine don&#x27;t look any different. Not very comfy.&lt;br /&gt;Although these come with many lashes &amp; they&#x27;re in decent quality for the low price..&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I am in love with how natural these lashes are. They are very lightweight and easy to apply. The price is phenomenal. They may not last as long as my individual lashes however they are just as good.</li>
    <li> It does taxke some expertise, white eyelash glue because if you use black and dont know what you are doing a whole mess is whats going to be seen all over your eyelid. You can cut them and make them singles. To me they are soo natural looking and I love them.</li>
    <li> The fibers of this product are very cheap now this is a great buy for beginners but remember you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I like the lashes but for the $1.10 I paid for them they could be alittle thicker but they were cheap if u want falsies get good ones cheap not good</li>
    <li> Um cant beat 10 lashes for a dollar , plus free shipping , very easy to apply , didnt know how to apply lashes prior to this , and very natural looking , and feels like i&#x27;m wearing nothing</li>
    <li> I was a little suspected when placed the order. But when I received them and started using them, they are sooooooooooooo good. Soft, natural, and easy to use. I used them everyday now.</li>
    <li> The band is made of thread so it is very flexible and thin. I cut my in half and use it as half lashes for a more natural look. It was difficult to use it as a whole piece because the glue would dry on the thread making it look all clumpy if you don&#x27;t do it right the very first time. Only paid less than $1.50 with free shipping. Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> this were pretty great for the price i payed for them. They look very natural and not over sized and they don&#x27;t look exaggerated. they are perfect for any occasion</li>
    <li> Worth the wait but took quite sometime</li>
    <li> I like these they really are natural like even though their fake they make your natural lashes still look natural just enhanced like a little longer and if you add 2 coats of mascara on top of the fake lashes with your real ones they looks nice and thick I did however have a bit of a problem getting them to stay on somewhat because the lash band is thin and looks as though its made out of string (sewing thread)  but as long as you have a good glue then you&#x27;ll be fine! I totally recommend to anyone who loves false lashes a needs a pair for going on dates or other times when you don&#x27;t want people to be able to tell your wearing fake lashes!</li>
    <li> Super natural looking! I like them! And don&#x27;t break easily.</li>
    <li> Amazing customer service and amazing products, i am a makeup artist and i use these lashes on clients all the time! Amazing deal! Ive repurchased already!</li>
    <li> I love these! I didn&#x27;t realize how long they were until I actually got them. But that was no big deal, I just cut them the way I wanted! Will be ordering again</li>
    <li> These lashes are wonderful.  Light, and look very nice on the eye.  Easy to apply and last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend them highly.</li>
    <li> So natural looking perfect for my clients</li>
    <li> Natural everyday lashes!</li>
    <li> Second time ordering these lashes and it&#x27;s been about a year. Seriously, the deal is a steal! I have to say the second time i ordered i was a bit more satisfied.. Or maybe even dissatisfied? I say this because comparing the lashes from the first set i got a year ago are slightly longer than  the second set i got recently. It&#x27;s GREAT for a simple natural look to add thickness, which i like. Yet, i still want length! And the lashes doesnt meet that need as well. UPDATE MARCH 2015: I paid 1.28 in 2014. The price is now 1.80</li>
    <li> Very natural.&lt;br /&gt;Could be used on daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;It is exactly what I want, The price is reasonable,too.&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again!</li>
    <li> Good quality eyelashes in my opinion I love the fact that there hand made and can be applied easily if u have had experience with Putting eyelashes i will be ordering more in the future favorite eyelashes and at a great price</li>
    <li> I seriously didn&#x27;t expect them to be this beautiful. They look so natural. I had to cut mine just a little bit but other than that I love them. I recommend them and you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.</li>
    <li> They were a little long for me but other than that they are fine.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the packaging or the look of the lashes. I will stick to purchasing them from the store.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist and these fake eyelashes are beautiful. They&#x27;re very natural looking, blend in with real lashes easily.&lt;br /&gt;The band is a little thick, but if you apply eyeliner with it, it won&#x27;t be noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product, and the price is amazing!</li>
    <li> These lashes are great, they have a very thin band, and they look super incredibly natural. I mean you could honestly wear these every day, they look incredible. Great purchase!!</li>
    <li> I love love love it. Very natural I will most def. buy it again and again. Worth the money but takes time to receive</li>
    <li> i love these it does take a little longer then other products to get here but for the price and how many you get it is ok with me . i like to put these on when it isnt a special day there not to thick . i figured it would be plastic but i dont thank thay are if so thay did a really good job on them , you do have to cut them to your size but i have put on the same first pair 3 times and i really thank if i wash the glue off i could 3 more times if not more . great lashes</li>
    <li> Came earlier than I expected and I absolutely love them. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone!! I wish it came with glue though and the only problem I had was it was hard to take it out of the box</li>
    <li> i ordered from this seller and they totally sent me the WRONG items.. looks nothing like the picture. the lashes they sent were plastic n cant even wear them. im disappointed!!! i dont care how cheap the lashes were its the purpose... i ordered natural lookin ones n they sent me plastic lookin ones. i dont reccomend this seller!</li>
    <li> these are great lashes! the part where the hair is held together is made of thread so you don&#x27;t have that nasty plastic irritating part on your eye. At the same time they also look realistic when you wear them. Many people ask me if they are &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; which is great!</li>
    <li> The product shipped out to me so fast! It arrived almost three weeks ahead of what was estimated so that was a pleasant surprise. The lashes themselves bend very well and feel very nice and soft. Still haven&#x27;t had a chance to wear them out but I&#x27;m excited as they&#x27;re fairly natural but still give a little oomph to lashes. For 10 pairs of this quality the price was pretty awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside was the shipping method used. They came in a water-resistant package with padding so that was good, but I&#x27;m assuming through customs it got a little beat up so the box was a little crushed/ The lashes themselves were unscathed so I don&#x27;t see it as a big deal.</li>
    <li> for the price.. very good lashes.. easy appy procedure.. very flexible lashes.. LOOKS  SOO NATURAL..&lt;br /&gt;not bad at all I RECOMMEND .. also they are reapplyable YESSS I KNOW</li>
    <li> I got these to pracrie applying false eyelashes &amp; from what I can tell they&#x27;re great. they were easy to fit to my eye and they look natural &amp; fluttery. I&#x27;m happy with them!</li>
    <li> The last time I order this time I got way better eyelashes then this time&lt;br /&gt;They are now different today but I mean I guess I can&#x27;t complain&lt;br /&gt;For the price</li>
    <li> I have fake lashes once before and hated them and decided to give them one more try and these fake Lashes are great. I can not even feel them. I love love love them.</li>
    <li> Totally fake looking. I ended up throwing them out.</li>
    <li> I do not like these eyelashes veru much. They blend very well with the natural lashes which I love. I don&#x27;t like how thick the band is or how wide the lashes are. I guess these were made for people with wide eyes but you get what you pay for. Would not recommend</li>
    <li> these lashes are ok, they have to be formed though into the shape of the eye  they come off the package a lil straight, but overall an ok purchase</li>
    <li> I just received my eyelashes in the mail and I have to honestly say they weren&#x27;t what I was expecting. As soon as I opened up the mail packaging I noticed a lot of dents in the product box. With which one of the corners were actually caved in from it being handled in the mail. This was quite surprising because of the fact that it was surrounded by bubble wrap. Besides that you have to do a lot of trimming with these eyelashes, as soon as you take the eyelashes out of the original spot there is about a 3/4 inch of extra eyelash liner on both sides that must be cut. Overall I must say this was just an ok product.</li>
    <li> Lovvedddddd them seriously 100 times better then any other lashes I&#x27;ve used look natural and by far the best ones I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> The style I wanted was &amp;#34;style 0&amp;#34; but I think I received &amp;#34;style 9&amp;#34;. The eyelashes were okay- after I trimmed it a bit and fluffed it up to make it seem more natural, but the band wasn&#x27;t the greatest.&lt;br /&gt;There were bits of white adhesive on the lashes that holds the hair- it is more noticeable once it is placed on the lashes.&lt;br /&gt; Overall the product is okay for the price, but I would have been happier if I received the right lashes.</li>
    <li> Nice price, nice eyelashes! At first you may think it hard to apply, but after some practice, you will be fine, I&#x27;m sure. I feel quite comfortable wearing them. A good buy!</li>
    <li> I obviously wasn&#x27;t expecting alot from this product since the price was ridiculously low. I received the eyelashes in an envelop and the box containing them was a little bent, the eyelashes themselves were fine. It was hard to take them off from the box but i found plucking them worked fine. If the eyelash gets bent out of shape or twisted it is ruined. As far as size goes I thought they were okay, I used mascara on them to make a bit more defined. I also purchased these to practice putting on fake eyelashes because i didnt want to waste money ruining good ones. Overall I was content with this purchase. But dont expect much for $2 eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes!😍 look so Natural and full! Been using  these for a while now! I get so many compliments!</li>
    <li> Natural, beautiful, and is comfortable what more can a girl asked for</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know it was attached to thread highly disappointed 😕</li>
    <li> Looks very natural and beautiful, just needed to cut the lash line.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing false eye lashes for 40 years. I am impressed with this product</li>
    <li> This product is terrible.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes easy to put on great for my almond shaped eyes</li>
    <li> too fine for stage use. could possibly use in daily life; however the strip is just a black string so they are a bit difficult to apply with precision.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what i expected. The eyelashes are held together on a black piece of thread. Very noticeable. Threw them in the trash.</li>
    <li> Should have read the fine print not real human hair they were plastic.&lt;br /&gt;I didnt even waste the time shipping them back to the seller I just threw them out.</li>
    <li> I have been a professional makeup artist for 17 years and while I typically purchase lashes of higher price ranges to insure quality, I was not overwhelmingly disappointed by these lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I admit, they are stiff but all you have to do is run your nail across the lash line in a curved position a few times and they loosen right up.&lt;br /&gt;They are really long (width of eye), which I like so that I can cut on both ends of the lash for the most natural appearance and comfort. I always try out products on myself before my clients and these were light, natural, and long wearing (I use waterproof dark tinted glue; current brand-Revlon Dark Lash Adhesive).&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for about ten cents a lash, I&#x27;m satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> I really like these eyelashes they are very natural looking and I adore the black band. The band makes it easier to look as if they were yours. I will def buy more.</li>
    <li> these are okay, they do look pretty natural. I don&#x27;t wear them, but use them on sculptures.</li>
    <li> Best eyelashes I&#x27;ve ever tried ! I wear them all the time</li>
    <li> did not have a sturdy lash band to apply. they look nice but the band is like a string material,not good for beginners</li>
    <li> Great for the subtle natural look. Very easy to use. The strip looks like it&#x27;s made of thread so it&#x27;s very flexible. Does not have the curve for the eyes.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t received them yet but sure their a 5</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very poor quality. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Its ok ..Gave them to my daughter.. There a little to thick and long.&lt;br /&gt;But my 34 yr old daughter loves them.</li>
    <li> The most natural lashes I&#x27;ve seen. Love it !!! Thank you very much. I will order again when needed ! &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used false lashes from high-end makeup brands and can honestly say these are pretty good. For the price they&#x27;re wonderful. They look natural, which I like because I look odd when I try to wear dramatic lashes. But be careful when taking them out of the package and applying them because they&#x27;re on a thin string and it can break rather easily. I recommend applying them with Duo eyelash glue.&lt;br /&gt;The package took very long to get here... I live in the US so I expected that but I&#x27;d never waited so long on a package. Most of the time when I order from Asia it takes about a week and a half but this took almost three weeks. :/</li>
    <li> received the item earlier than o expected and they are really soft and look very natural! Great product. The price was awesome too.....</li>
    <li> They are pretty good! Of course they are &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; eyelashes so you can&#x27;t wear them over and over like some you pay $8 a pair for. I have to trim them since they are a little large, but they look very natural and are great &amp;#34;everyday lashes&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I loved these lashes the soft ends make it feel better when you have them on all day because there&#x27;s no hard edge to stab you in the eye when it comes up a little half way through the day. they are a beautiful product. handmade and good quality. they are shipped from china so i expected a few weeks for shipping since i have ordered  from that part of the world before, however i was annoyed when shipping took a whole month! regardless i am happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> They become misshapen if you don&#x27;t use tweezers  to remove them from their case. I tried to use my fingers and it bends the lashes too much.  You will need to trim them to fit your eyes. I liked the lightweight band (it&#x27;s more like a thick thread) but it also means that they can be tricky to apply. Some reviewers mentioned plastic fake-looking eyelashes. I think the ones I received were similar to the picture.  They are Style 0. I noticed there are a lot of other eyelashes to choose from under this caption and different vendors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received these I had little experience applying fake eyelashes. It was a disaster. I almost threw them away since they only cost one dollar plus shipping fees. But since I waited so long to receive them, I decided to hold off. In the mean time, I used other lashes with thicker bands.  It is a trade off -- the thicker bands are usually easier to apply, but less comfortable.  I recently revisited these lashes. They are neither my favorites nor the most natural looking (I prefer the criss cross style for looking natural), but they are inexpensive and you can discard them away after one use. I think this might be a little more hygienic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think these are in the middle of the pantheon of fake eyelashes because of their value proposition and comfort factor.  Nevertheless, novice beware!</li>
    <li> The lashes I received are not the Lashes in the pic...but for a $1 and some change cant really complain I guess. You get what you pay for huh?? More than likely I will give them away.</li>
    <li> These are very natural looking and they are so so inexpensive. They took awhile to get here, but that was not a big deal to me at all. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments when I wear these! they look so real and the band is real thin so you dont have to use eyeliner with them. although they took like 2 months to come in.</li>
    <li> The lashes I got were stiff, crushed from delivery, uncomfortable and WAY TOO FAKE LOOKING. not happy... but since it was only couple dollars, didn&#x27;t really expect too much... couple dollars wasted and lesson learned. DISAPPOINTED</li>
    <li> I love these lashes I use four pair becasue I like thicker lashes they look and feel so real yes it is a great buy!!</li>
    <li> I was hoping to get these super long lashes as shown in the picture, but was given short, criss crossed lashes instead. I&#x27;ll have to give it to the seller though -- they were extremely responsive and gave me a refund in a matter of hours. Still looking for these long lashes, so I might just give them another try. Shipping takes a long time as it comes from China, but it&#x27;s a great steal.</li>
    <li> I personally did not like these. I&#x27;m not a pro at putting on false eyelashes to start with so maybe that&#x27;s why I had some troubles with these ones. I did not realize these were on a sort of thread and have no curve to them. Also, the eyelash part was delicate and easily bent when I removed one it crushed and bent the lashes.For those that left good reviews and said they had no trouble with these..I am impressed because I couldn&#x27;t get these things on.Maybe I need more practice.</li>
    <li> These were ok, but didn&#x27;t wear these for long. They were cheap to buy and the product is just as cheap. Wont buy these again and wouldn&#x27;t recommend them to anyone</li>
    <li> So cheap plastic like material did not even feel like hair. You should purchase the ones that are on a piece of thread than these.</li>
    <li> My daughter was happy. They are more realistic and natural. We tried another brand and she was not happy.&lt;br /&gt;Great stocking stuffers! I know she will be ordering more. I rated the 4 stars because there were two pairs that came out stiff so she couldn&#x27;t wear them, they wouldn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a beginner at putting on false lashes, but these were not that difficult to work with. They also didn&#x27;t look super fake either.</li>
    <li> i guess i am simply used to the ones I like, I thought these were to flimsy. Not my personal taste, but others might like it :)</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are awesome. You have to cut the tiny edges of string that they use to hold them into the box. Also when you apply your glue, while your waiting for it to dry, shape the lash slightly back into its &amp;#34;c&amp;#34; shape, because they are shipped flat. Once you wear them a day, use a tweezers nip off the used glue. Then keep an old eyelash package you may have from a store bought pair and use it to store them, to keep their shape and you can get at least 2-3 uses out of each pair. The add a natural fullness and a great length.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed these lashes. They are durable and last a long time. Very easy to put on verses the store brand one. They are plastic but look very natural. Will reorder again.</li>
    <li> If your looking for a pair of cheap lashes that more realistic then I highly suggest these. They are lightly dark but are thin like real lashes. I purchased a few pairs of cheap lashes through Amazon and these were the only ones that looked decent. I highly suggest these.</li>
    <li> These lashes late beautifull I&#x27;m 53 and never WOR lashes before but I got them on th e first time i plan on purchasing more</li>
    <li> I wear lashes a lot and these were fairly wellmade</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something that looks natural, these have been my favorite buy. Cheap and natural looking. It has a &amp;#34;soft backbone&amp;#34; which means the lashes are on a thin string. Because of that, it is so very comfortable to have on. If you are used to &amp;#34;hard backbone&amp;#34; lashes, these might take a little getting used to in order to put on. It feels like i just have mascara on. I bought a few other brands that were more expensive but save your money. They are so cheap that I wear just once and discard (although I think you can use them for multiple use if you treat them well.) They are probably not human hair, hence the price. I double up when I want a dramatic look and they stack pretty nicely. I have worn these lashes for years not and I still love them.</li>
    <li> HATE HATE HATE.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  They are flimsy and horrible!!</li>
    <li> I like them, they are a bit to long for me but thats no problem, my only issue is that when i received them the packed was all banged up and a pair of the lashes were messed up.</li>
    <li> They look natural and were softer than the other fake lashes out there</li>
    <li> thank you very much is exactly what is described in the information , I would give more than  stars and of curse I will bay whit you.</li>
    <li> Took a little while for it to arrive, but that&#x27;s expected since it&#x27;s coming from China. They aren&#x27;t the highest quality lashes (duh.. You get what you pay for). Overall, it&#x27;s exactly what I expected and wanted. Very natural looking and adds that extra pop on your eyes without looking obviously fake. These lashes are going to last a long while since I don&#x27;t wear falsies that often, but I know where to come back for more! Thanks for a great, affordable product!</li>
    <li> Natural look. Not reusable.</li>
    <li> Fake looking and feeling&lt;br /&gt;Obvious plastic Plastic..&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t stay on well at all. Arrived a little different than the picture..</li>
    <li> I love how natural looking they are. My lashes are about the same length and they blend in perfectly. You can&#x27;t tell that you&#x27;re wearing falsies when applied correctly. Enjoy ladies! :)</li>
    <li> These are very good lashes for the price. honestly i cant tell the difference between these and more expensive ones. it does take a little bit to get them but its totally worth it. dosent come with adhesive but still a great bargain.</li>
    <li> best fake eyelashes I&#x27;ve ever had! They are so soft so it&#x27;s easier for me to adjust. I would definitely buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> These are fine but are very hard to put on as the lashes are attached to thread. I don&#x27;t have that much of a problem applying them as I have had a lot of practice over the years. These are definitely for advanced eyelash appliers only. That being said, they do look completely natural once you get them on.</li>
    <li> I love them! This is my 3rd time purchasing and everytime time I purchase I buy 2 or 3 at a time. They look so natural and I can re-use up to 3 times if taken care properly. And a little trick I do when I want them to look more dramatic and fuller, I put 2 pairs on and fabulous!  I always get commented on my lashes if they only knew they weren&#x27;t mine.</li>
    <li> It is the same product as &amp;#34;New Thin 10 Pair Natural Black Long Fake False Eyelashes&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Like exactly same. but it is great quality, I am glad to have two of them.</li>
    <li> Came waayy earlier than expected. I love them. Very natural looking. Will order them again.</li>
    <li> Plasticky but nice with some mascara blended on it but for the price who can really complaint different sizes and shapes great variety and fast delivery will purchase again</li>
    <li> what a great product for the price!! These look better and more natural than any fake lashes that i have bought at the store. I&#x27;m going to buy more of these.</li>
    <li> NIce lashes.  They were a little long for my everyday wear so I trimmed them a bit.  I also had to trim the length across my eye.  They were very long across the eye.  The lashes added a lot of thickness to my lashes and held up nicely.  Just a warning though, It took over a month for me to actually get these lashes shipped to my house, so if you have time to wait they are a good choice for the money.</li>
    <li> blend in with your real ones. very flexible.</li>
    <li> Ok product, very cheap price.</li>
    <li> If I could give these 0 star rating, I would. The bands suck. They don&#x27;t stay on no matter what type of lash glue you use. Useless.</li>
    <li> i have been ordering these for years. they look natural for everyday use!</li>
    <li> They were ok for the price</li>
    <li> These lashes are great, and the price can&#x27;t be beaten.  They are probably the most natural looking eyelashes that I have ever used as a professional.  The strip is thin and not noticeable when applied, the volume is not too heavy, and they are comfortable.  Also, if shorter length is desired, they are easy to trim down.  (Leave them attached to the packing, trim, then apply to eyes.)  I do a lot of bridal makeup, and I will definitely continue to order these eyelashes!</li>
    <li> Absolutely adorable ! They arrived a week early in perfect condition . They are easy to apply and gorgeous . I&#x27;m in love and will definitely buy more from this seller . 5 stars !</li>
    <li> They are very natural looking I haven&#x27;t tried them on yet...</li>
    <li> the length of the lashes are fine but these are a bitch to get on! the thread is super soft and not as easy to get a hold of.</li>
    <li> After reading all the positive reviews about how natural these eyelashes look I was very excited to get them- I ordered 4 boxes. My box says \\&quot;extended\\&quot; lashes so I&#x27;m not sure if maybe thats the problem but these look SO SO fake. I put them on just to try them and I seriously looked like Tammy Fay Baker!! I even tried trimming them to just put them on the outer corner of my eye to see if that helped but I looked ridiculous they are just way too long. Really, really bad- total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Buying more of these! Makes my lashes look so long and real!</li>
    <li> Shipping Speed:&lt;br /&gt;Ordered on October 14, and the Delivery Estimate was from Nov 7-Nov 28. It arrived today, October 26.&lt;br /&gt;So faster shipping than expected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:&lt;br /&gt;Came in a bubble envelope. The box was inside, and it didn&#x27;t have any seals indicated that it has not been opened before, but I&#x27;m just assuming that&#x27;s how it should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyelashes:&lt;br /&gt;A fabric string holds the eyelashes together. They&#x27;re long, so of course you cut them to fit your eye shape like any other false eyelash. BUT I came to understand why the reviews are mixed. People reported that these were hard to apply. I&#x27;m no expert on falsies, but I know how to apply them easily enough. Because of the string that holds these together, these eyelashes can&#x27;t exactly mold correctly to my eye shape, even if I bend or wrap them around my tweezers to make them more flexible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solution?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cut the lashes in half/in smaller sections. I personally am going to start wearing these as demi (half) lashes, then build up to the full set. Cut these makes application so much easier, and looks more natural because the lashes sit closer on the lash line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long will these last per use?&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;ll just have to find out. I&#x27;ve seen that pull a little on the lashes pulls them out, so when removing these I&#x27;ll have to be careful. I can&#x27;t say how many times I can use each of these exactly, but if I&#x27;m only using these as half lashes so that I can have 20 uses rather than 10, then I estimate about 3 uses per pair, which would last me 60 days unless I mess up a pair. I&#x27;ll just have to update on how long these last though, especially with use with and without mascara.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried them on yet but they look very natural and i was very pleased especially with the price lol i would definitely buy them again. I would also recommend that you have a lash curler for that natural curl</li>
    <li> 10 eyelashes for 1.oo.  Recommended by a friend as she had many compliments on her long natural eyelashes..  In revealing her secret she told where and how to buy on line. I for one have not been disappointed.</li>
    <li> The base is somewhat flimsy, which makes these perfect for the inexperienced applicator.  These are the first falsies that I have been able to apply with little resistance.  They also look amazingly natural.  I&#x27;m sold - these falsies are reusable and awesome.</li>
    <li> Best eyelashes ever. They don&#x27;t look fake at all. Would totally recommend if you&#x27;re looking for eyelashes that look realistic..</li>
    <li> These are some pretty nice lashes. The do look natural; they aren&#x27;t all thick and fake looking. They fit my eye perfectly and I didn&#x27;t need to cut them or anything. The downside to these lashes is that the lash itself bends easily. While putting one on i accidentally bent a few lashes and the look like and &#x27;&amp;#34;L&amp;#34; shape. but it was easily fixed by bending it in the other direction so not really a problem. The band is really thin, the lashes are very light on the face. They are a bit difficult to put on because the curve in them is more straight across then curved but its still doable. The shipping was fine I guess. I ordered it on the 17th of march and it shipped out 3 days later and I just just received them today so it took about 17 days before I received them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am really happy with this product and I will probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> These lashes are the BOMB!!! I use them each and every day!They are re-usable and easy to use. Why spend all the extra money on the costly lashes if you can save money and still look just as FABULOUS!  I find the company that they come from is fast and the product is worth each penny.  ORDER THEM and see for yourself.</li>
    <li> These lashes look like they would be super cute and natural but the way they are packaged makes them useless&lt;br /&gt;they are tied at ends and have to be tugged out of box often resulting in damaging the lashes&lt;br /&gt;utting the lashes on proved to be a nightmare as well as they are so stringy that they don&#x27;t stick or shape well&lt;br /&gt;Not gona buy these again</li>
    <li> Having allergic reaction to these. Never had any problem with any others. Made okay and good deal</li>
    <li> i have this eyelashes and i love love love them! they look very natural and they are not heavy on my eyes :-) i love using them with no eyeshadow and just a thin line of eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Great lashes. They come on a thread which makes it super easy to apply. Only downfall is the shipping time. I ordered 20 pairs and will need to put in another order now so they will come before those are all used, approximately 2 months. But for the price they&#x27;re definitely worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Such a great deal and good quality</li>
    <li> I love these lashes. They&#x27;re a good length and super soft.</li>
    <li> the worse, really bad, at least my came out terrible</li>
    <li> I bought a box of these in 2013, apparently, and I&#x27;m still using them. I cut them in half and trim them a bit, to use on the outsides of my eyelashes. They&#x27;re soft, look natural, and are sturdy enough to handle multiple uses! Love them. And not just because the awesome price.</li>
    <li> This is SUCH a good deal on falsies. I watched you tube for how to put them on and I learned that way, then I was amazed to find these on Amazon so cheaply! OMG wow. They are good quality and look good too.</li>
    <li> These lashes are very thin and barely noticeable on. However, they are very easy to apply. My evaluation is as follows:  the lashes are not really spectacular...but simply \\&quot;OK\\&quot;. However, the packaging was very durable and shipping pretty fast.</li>
    <li> Not easy to apply. Guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I Love these. They looks great and there are super inexpensive!</li>
    <li> Cheap and flimsy come apart and are hard to shape, but they work with enough glue, they are basically a black string with eyelashes on it</li>
    <li> Like many others, I was very skeptical of buying these lashes. But for the price I couldn&#x27;t pass them up! I was so happy when I got them, they were so much more natural looking in person! Plus, they came a few weeks earlier than expected! I highly recommend these lashes!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really care for the way these looked in person</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best investment the lashes came weeks in advance seriously perfect! Also the lashes came in a cute box nice clean and handled with care, will buy again!</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for... cheap, cheap, cheap.... i will invest in better false eyelashes next time...if you have money to waste i recommend you buy this &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> These are pretty long, but they aren&#x27;t think so they still work really well. The don&#x27;t have a bend to the strip but they aren&#x27;t too stiff to bend yourself.</li>
    <li> These lashes are really nice n natural looking on your eyes. They just need to b cut and It easy to apply. Applied them in minutes. Love them</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not an expert at using eyelashes. They are definitely a use once...maybe twice and throw away. For the price they are fine.</li>
    <li> I realized with the cheaper price, they may not be as good or easy to apply.  They work, just a bit trickier to apply with ease. They certainly need the string trimmed on each side, so that is a bit of a turn off as so many others I dont have to do that with.</li>
    <li> Really love them and ready to buy more!!! So light and natural that i love them totally buying more more!!!!</li>
    <li> Love these, still have some left easy to put on and take off also they look natural</li>
    <li> These lashes are very natural looking.  They do NOT look fake at all.  Very soft and easy to apply.  I did have to trim a tiny bit off the edges, but thats about the only complaint I had.  I got about 6 uses out of each pair.</li>
    <li> This lashes feel and look very real..easy to install and last all day.</li>
    <li> Eyelashes are really soft, look natural and comfortable to work with. As a makeup artist I strongly reccomend these lashes for a wedding makeup and for your everyday makeup.</li>
    <li> They are good eyelashes. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that I have to cut the ends because of the string. Becareful when taking them out or you might mess them up like I did.</li>
    <li> I have never worn false lashes before. So I decided to risk it on a .78 cent product. These took about three weeks to reach me, which I was prepared for from reading all the reviews and I just got them yesterday. I think they&#x27;re great! I used them with Ardell Eyelash Adhesive, LashGrip, Clear, which dries super fast. I trimmed both sides of these lashes a little bit and eventually figured out how to put them on the right way. I think they look very natural and if you disagree, you always have the option of trimming the length of the lashes a little bit. You can probably get 2-3 uses (as in removing them and putting them back on) out of each of these lashes which makes these an even better deal. Having nothing to compare these to, I can&#x27;t say if they are better or worse than other lashes, but for a first time false eyelash wearer, I&#x27;m very excited about these.</li>
    <li> beautiful and simple would buy again</li>
    <li> i was skeptical about the lashes being on a string, but they are actually really good for the price. i only wear lashes during the day for thickness at the base, but can easily be doubled at night for a more dramatic look. ill def be buying these again. the only down side was i felt like shipping took forever.</li>
    <li> Best deal ever!! And so comfortable and easy to wear!!!</li>
    <li> These were extremely thin and made cheaply just on a string. However the string was easy to glue on and wasn&#x27;t noticeable. Although since I have ok-average lashes, you couldn&#x27;t see a difference between the eye with this lash and the eye without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the wait or money!</li>
    <li> Amaze-balls!! Love these eyelashes!! I used to buy ardell lashes all the time but they got so expensive but these are a great alternative! They feel soo soft and they look extremely natural!</li>
    <li> Good deal and nice size lashes. Quick shipping too</li>
    <li> I hesitated on writing a review I wanted to wait till I had tried them various times to say wether I liked them or not. I purchased the &amp;#34;Style 0&amp;#34; ones and I must say not as bad as I thought . The edges are awful so if you&#x27;re like me and you&#x27;re always rushing make sure u have something to cut off the edges with. Also they are pretty hard to put on and don&#x27;t last that long . They looked natural to me but I naturally have really long eyelashes . My friend purchased a different style and I tried hers they worked well . Glued on , made more of a difference That&#x27;s why I gave a 3 star instead of a 1.</li>
    <li> love this ones :))) verry happy</li>
    <li> Soft, natural, and great price. You cannot get one nice pair of falsies for under 10 dollars at the store. 10 perfect handmade pairs. And they look so natural.</li>
    <li> Received quickly. Item was as described. Nice quality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simple and realistic.</li>
    <li> good for everday use and it look really natural&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was going to use this for cosplay but it not that full it better for everday use</li>
    <li> I really do love these lashes! I thought they would look really fake on, but these are just as good as the expensive ones.</li>
    <li> I really liked this lashes, they were so soft and more natural looking. I will be purchasing them in the future.</li>
    <li> I love how lightweight these lashes are! They are on a thread, not a plastic band and they pretty much disappear into your lash line. SO SO good</li>
    <li> The quality is good, the eyelashes are soft and look like natural, I like the way eyelash lay out, and it look good when put on.</li>
    <li> The eyelashes are so flimsy and are literally plastic. Well it was only a $1, so I get my moneys worth.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time they are just crappy and cheap not menter to last they are pretty but not worth it</li>
    <li> Finally I received these lashes.  They were not as durable as I suspected in viewing online;  I guess the saying buyers be ware is in line for this product.  they are thin and flimsy.</li>
    <li> first, they are on like a string very flimsy, they have to be cut to fit eye and difficult to even hold on to. I want the easy button, and something that will stay in place, that i dont have to fight with!</li>
    <li> These lashes don&#x27;t look like the pictures at all. I found that the lashes were all clumped together in chunks and I couldn&#x27;t separate them for the life of me! Very disappointed as I was hoping that they would look very natural :(</li>
    <li> All in all, I really like these lashes.  They&#x27;re good quality (especially for the price) and look very lovely on.  The one gripe I have about them is that the strips themselves are a bit too long.  To be fair, most false eyelash strips are, but these are the longest ones I&#x27;ve seen and I&#x27;m no stranger to falsies.  They also all have a little section of the strip on each side with no lashes on them that has to be cut off before wearing.  I would buy these again though.</li>
    <li> Pros:I love it these lashes, it is soft and natural Con: the lashes doesn&#x27;t have that curve to it. it Is harder to put it on</li>
    <li> I wasnt gifted with long thick lashes so I always put on falsies for that extra zing when I do my makeup on a night out &amp; special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, these take about a month ro receive so prepare to wait and be patient. (Keep in mind you cant track the package either) Anyway, these lashes (style 0) are good for the price. You get 10 pairs for 1.10 which is a steal. They are natural looking in my opinion and arent heavy. The only con about these lashes is that the  band is a little thick so try to apply it as close to your lash line as possible. With the band being a little too thick, its not as flexible or flimsy which is why i knocked off a star. Another thing about these lashes is that the lash band is longer than my actual lash line but just cut and trim to your liking and its fixed!! If u want, you can actually cut one false lash in half and use it as an accent for your outer lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would recommend it to a friend.  Its actually really good for the price. Im ordering more for future uses.</li>
    <li> They are awesome for one time use and look natural!!!! Would recommend for first time users and starters. Blah blah</li>
    <li> I have been waiting for a month for my eyelashes to come nothing..  still waiting.  I will wait 2 more weeks befor I complain about this ordeal. ...</li>
    <li> I use these everyday!!!  Very nice and comfortable!!!  I have gotten so many compliments on them all the time! They are very long but i have higher set eyebrows and they look beautiful!</li>
    <li> These lashes are very cute. They are well made and the price was right. They blend with my natural eyelashes perfectly. I&#x27;m sure ill buy some more.</li>
    <li> I always order these lashes they are easy to use and the bands are very subtle.</li>
    <li> Love them, I read the previews and was a little scared to order, but I love them there nice and thin so they look more natural and it doesn&#x27;t look as cartoonish. I have very small eyes and I think they look great on me.</li>
    <li> Definitely not natural looking by themselves, but I layered them with a more natural looking pair I had and it looks like I have super thick lashes. Band isn&#x27;t too thick and sticks with glue well.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t worse them yet I&#x27;m still tryna figure out how to wear them but I&#x27;ll figure it out one day .</li>
    <li> I order them on the 5 and i recieved them less dan a week i coudmt believe the fast service they have awesom i will order more</li>
    <li> I was in the market for false lashes but wanted a natural look. Most of the ones  that I came across are WAY too dramatic. I know these are false lashes, but I don&#x27;t want it to actually look like I&#x27;m wearing falsies. These do just the trick. They&#x27;re not all bunched together like dramatic lashes and they have a soft backbone that is easy to apply. I don&#x27;t have a lot of lashes and they are pretty thin; these blend in perfectly and give me more volume and length without the obviousness that I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes for an extra oomph. I recommend these and will be purchasing more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: I&#x27;ve discovered that if you curl your lashes with these on, they will look very dramatic, so it is usable for both natural and dramatic looks. If you put them on and don&#x27;t curl your lashes, it&#x27;s a much more natural look.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.. It&#x27;s too long for me. I will stick to mascara instead.</li>
    <li> They look nice and are pretty. The only complaints i have is that they are long but i cut them and the lashes kind of look backwards. but other than that they are pretty good.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXTRA LONG AND THICK !!</li>
    <li> These are inexpensive but very good</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the quality of these lashes. They are hard to work with when applying  and flimsy. I was not able to get any use of them.  Shipping was slow also.</li>
    <li> The estimated delivery date was 3 days ago. And since the product comes with NO TRACKING INFORMATION I have nooooo idea when it will come or where it is. So one star for you. Will write a review on the actual product if it ever comes but for now, this is a review on their shipping.</li>
    <li> Cheap and you get what you pay for, Not able to lay them properly on my lashes. Just Ok. Hope to get to wear atleast once.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and natural looking,&lt;br /&gt;Follow my instagram (: @eriyahna</li>
    <li> Great for those who want lashes, but not the heavy look and feel</li>
    <li> Shipped as expected. Look natural.</li>
    <li> Natural looking lashes for a great price! I get 3 uses at least from each pair! They fit bigger eyes and can be cut to fit smaller lids.</li>
    <li> These lashes are better than any I have bought in stores. They are soft and very natural looking. I am a novice lash wearer and concerned that they will look fake but I even fooled my family, they thought they were my lashes. I am ordering more!!</li>
    <li> I placed an order for these expecting them to be less than what had been described by the seller. I was surprised to see what I got! VERY impressed with them! I got them today in the mail, (was not impressed with that part of it), opened the package to find the boxes a bit crunched but no damage to the product. I opened one package of the five I ordered to find they feel and look really natural compared to what I was buying before, (Revlon). I haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to try them yet, but I have a really good feeling about these since I have used a LOT of other brands and just by what I see and feel, these are exactly what I was looking for! The lashes were not fake looking at all. The coloring was natural, the feel is really nice and very flexable in my fingers. Even the length is nice, not too long just perfect to give the eye a thicker lash look. I am really looking forward to trying them today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, onto other matters of this purchase... Would have given the seller 5 stars if it hadn&#x27;t been for what I am about to write next. I said earlier the package I received was poorly package for shipping. A plastic bag with NO PADDING, not even an invoice slip! They charged per item in the shipment then another sum on top of that and then shipped package through the postal service! I&#x27;m sorry, but that was totally a joke! It seemed to me it was just another place to make a bit of PROFIT without it being noticed! I spent close to a good $9.00 in a shipment that did not weigh in pounds but in OUNCES, no protection for the product, (IE: no bubble wrap or foam padding), and used the SLOWEST possible shipping method possibly known! I am really on the fence about if I would want to buy from this seller again for this reason. To be fair, yes, I received the package in the alotted time frame, but just barely. I received it the last day they said I would get it. I think if they are going to charge what they are charging for their shipping rates, it has to be justifiable somewhere along the way. I saw absolutely NO justification for what was paid in shipping charges!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June15, 2012:&lt;br /&gt;Sorry it took so long for me to get back to give you my opinion on the eyelashes after trying them....these lashes are PERFECT!. If You have long eyelashes but just want a bit of a fuller look, these are exactly what you are looking for! The look is very very natural when you wear them. I have gotten 3 uses out of one pair, probably could get more, but they start showing a bit of wear after three uses and since I bought quite a few boxes of them, I am good with three wears. They are a nice soft lash that gives your eyes a fuller look and I wear them on an everyday basis. I rate them as a great lash for the money and for everyday wear! No one had noticed they are fake at all!somewhere along the way.

    <li> At first when I open the package I was very disappointed&lt;br /&gt;I thought \\&quot; what? These lashes r hanging on literally a tread, how am I going to put this on!&lt;br /&gt;But I did it like I do my regular falsies I didn&#x27;t have ai  problem nobody knew they were false everyone told me my eyes look beautiful and how lucky I was to have long lashes :)  I am ordering again</li>
    <li> Great lashes for the price and quantity. They are very natural looking and can easily be cut down to size. They seem to be made of an almost fabric like material which makes them very light. I will definitely buy again. Only downside is that they come from china so the shipping speed is incredibly slow.</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t fit eyes correctly</li>
    <li> I have never worn eyelashes before, these are perfect for the newbies. They are just as pictured not too thick and plenty to practice with.</li>
    <li> This is the best style of under lashes on Amazon. Have ordered numerous  boxes of this item.</li>
    <li> It was horribly thin, i gave them to my little cousins to play with because they werent usable for me!</li>
    <li> I was looking for some natural looking lashes that I could wear for everyday and these are definitely what I was looking for! Like the heading says, they are so soft that you forget you&#x27;re even wearing them and I believe that is because the lash line is thin and flimsy. This is certainly a good thing for me, but it might pose problems for some women who find it difficult to put on fake lashes.&lt;br /&gt;The lack of a star is for the length of the lashes- a bit long but not terribly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I wear them everyday now and, aside from a small handful of women, no one notices they are fake and I completely forget that I have them on, which in turn, saves me a lot of stress.</li>
    <li> 1st, you should know these are shipped from China. I bought these with my Amazon Prime account. The seller does ship them right away, but arrival can take a couple weeks. It was WORTH the wait. These lashes are well-made. I don&#x27;t like my lashes to be too long or too thick. My natural lashes are thick, but short and these add just enough length so that my lashes are noticeable but not distracting. I will be ordering more when these run out. So far, I&#x27;ve been able to wear my 1st set twice and may get one more use out of them.</li>
    <li> WOW Love Love Love these!! They go on super easy and are soft enough that they stick not come up on the side corners. I also like the fact that they look no natural. Great buy!</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are a bit more dramatic than i thought they&#x27;d look, but they look beautiful, I can&#x27;t wait to get some eyelash glue and try them on. The price is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the whole false eyelash thing and I bought the ardel brand from the store and they look so nice on,but are kind of expensive so I thought these would be great and they are so cheap.&lt;br /&gt;The box they cam in is nice and the shipping was super fast.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had is that they don&#x27;t have any curl to them.  They look nice and natural except they are so long that they touch my eyebrows so I tried to trim them and because they don&#x27;t have a natural curl to them they stuck straight out and looked really funny.&lt;br /&gt;Some one who&#x27;s better at putting them on might enjoy these, but for me they didn&#x27;t work and I don&#x27;t have an eyelash curler because my eyelashes curl on their own so I don&#x27;t know if they could just be curled or not.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this item. Not what I expected. Waste of money and I shop here love this site just not happy with this item.</li>
    <li> Very nice and thin.  They look very real.  I&#x27;m not crazy about how thin they are at the lash line, but I guess I can get used to it for the price and look.  The item took a while to get to me, but they are worth the wait for such a bargain!</li>
    <li> I have worn falsies for 8 years. I have never found a product I truly liked. They all seemed way too long, thick, and fake looking. These have the consistency of natural lashes. They aren&#x27;t too thick or long (but they are long). In fact, I almost want to stop wearing them because I have to deal with so many compliments! People think these are real. I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
    <li> Lashes are just attached together by a string which makes it very hard to work with.</li>
    <li> Horrible quality doesn&#x27;t stick with any glue. The worst choice I have ever made when I bought this lashes. WASTE OF MONEY</li>
    <li> for what this cost the lashes are really natural looking. very good item to pratice with. i like them. i wish i had recieved my applicator at the same time.</li>
    <li> The only decent thing about these lashes is the price. They do not look natural. They continue to look fake and cheap after trimming them. They did not want to form to my eyes and they did not stick to the eye easily. They are annoying to work with. Seller was easy to work with and did offer a refund or free replacement. Customer Service was top notch.</li>
    <li> These lashes were shipped to me very fast and they are extremely cheap. 10 lashes for only 3 bucks is a great deal. When I got them they came in the cute package shown and they are extremely light and they don&#x27;t make my eyes feel heavy at all. These give your eyes an extra umph and they look very natural. I love them.</li>
    <li> One of the worst pairs of eyelashes I have ever seen. I was trying to buy a bundle, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It looks so cheap and would break off so quickly. I would give it a 1/2 star, if I could. Please don&#x27;t waste time or money buying this product.</li>
    <li> These eyelashes suck! They are terrible to put on i mean, they dont even go on right on your eyes. I hope nobody buys this because its a waste of your money.</li>
    <li> I really like the texture of these  eyelashes..they feel so real to the touch I&#x27;have bought some before from the pharmacy and I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> this is a great accessory for women. sure my wife love it. will be helpful for her make up skills to be improved</li>
    <li> These are great looks very natural</li>
    <li> These are good for beginners or if you want a natural pretty look. You have to be careful with the lashes because since theyre on a string, they can move around and that would look odd when you put them on. However, if you know how to use them, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> These are really interesting because they have a soft band, but I love them. I&#x27;m not super experienced with eyelashes,but I used these with the Duo lash glue and it worked well for me. I actually cut one eyelash in half, and use them as half-lashes. It works really well because they are symmetrical. I loved these. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> They are so nice!!! The packaging is so cute too! I can&#x27;t wait to wear them. Thank you.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great and look very natural</li>
    <li> Theese lashes suck to say the least! I just received mine today and I was so excited . I open them and they have a small fly in them! Very disappointed and unsanitary</li>
    <li> too long to fit but good you have to cut them off some to fit and  that&#x27;s o.k. but be careful when cutting you might cut too much</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these lashes! They&#x27;re very light, soft, and natural looking. The thin string they&#x27;re on makes stacking very easy I had to use two to get my desired look. Thin string also looks like you have in eye liner!!!!</li>
    <li> if you like really long lashes then these are for you !! they look very nice when they&#x27;re on, you do have to trim them a bit to make them fit the right way though. they also came about a week before I expected them. super happy with these : ))</li>
    <li> i love these lashes! No problem with them at all. And the price is a steal. Good for someone just starting out with falsies. For beginners, you&#x27;d only have a problem with how flimsy they are and you might need to trim them down just a tad bit. But if you&#x27;re used to putting on lashes like me, you&#x27;ll love them for everyday wear! Very natural, and packaging was OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen others stack two of these babies on for a fuller look, and that works too. Personally my lashes are very short and virtually not there when it comes to volume. These just do the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would opt for a very dramatic set of falsies though, on a night out.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these eyelashes. They are so soft and don&#x27;t look fake at all. Sometimes when you look at people you can just tell because they look to long or to thick for real eyelashes but these are perfect! I cut my down to fit my eyes and they stay all day. They don&#x27;t fray at the ends when I cut them either. So overall, a good product!</li>
    <li> The are pros and cons of this product, but more cons first they were neatly made, but the eye lashes are to short, and the glue gets all over the place because there is not much lash. I cannot recommend it.</li>
    <li> As an avid false eyelash wearer I would recommend these lashes to anyone. They are super soft and extremely natural looking. The only thing that may bug you is that if you wear glass they do brush against your lenses. With these lashes no one will know you&#x27;re wearing lashes unless you tell them.I am absolutely delighted with this product. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes!!! Arrived 2 weeks earlier and are easy to apply. Idk why people say they are hard to apply. Guess it depends on the glue you use. Lashes are great if you want a natural look. I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
    <li> happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Love this lashes they look so natural ,easy to apply considering I&#x27;m a beginier great for every day natural look</li>
    <li> cannot trim these eyelashes to fit the size of your eye.  they will unravel and shed lashes everywhere.  they are much too big for my eyes,  and I don&#x27;t have small eyes.  unusable</li>
    <li> Loved these lashes, and will DEFINITELY be repurchasing these. They are soft and flexible, natural looking and pretty easy to use once you practice. Great quality lashes for the price, I will never buy lashes in the store again! Many people didn&#x27;t even notice I was wearing false lashes. These just enhance your natural lashes&#x27; fullness and length. I bought these right before prom, doing my friend&#x27;s make up and as well as my own for many of our senior events when we wanted to look extra special. My friend has very short and straight lashes naturally, these looked so beautiful on her. I found that these were a little bit easier to apply on her than myself, but I think it will just take practice. The lashes are very wide and can be trimmed to fit anyone&#x27;s eye. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but I think cutting these in half and just using them as accent lashes on the outer half of the eye would be a bit more natural and beautiful too. LOVE LOVE LOVE these lashes and can&#x27;t wait to get more!</li>
    <li> Took a gamble on these and won and I am THRILLED with them.  YAY!!!  They are EXACTLY like the name brand ones in drugstores/ big chain stores and you get 10 for the price of ONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do come in a box with Chinese writing on it, but hey, I know what they are, and I thought that was kinda cool, and, anyways, like I care what the packaging looks like!  I just want the lashes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I thought since they came from China it would take them, like, two or three months to get here by sailboat or some super slow snail way, but they shipped pretty fast; I was impressed!  I don&#x27;t know how they did it but they got these lil&#x27; babies over here to the other side of the planet pretty quickly for an international order!  Another score for these lashes!!  hehe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s see...they do not shed, they are well-made, and I even washed the mascara out of mine (I am so used to trying to stretch the wear of my name brand ones that I wash them and use them over again to save money) and no hairs are falling out, they are exactly the same as the name brand!!!  My guess is these are their suppliers and this is the direct, non-inflated price!! Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They stayed on my eyelashes ALL night and did not budge, shed, droop, nothing...just wore perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are not curled, but, hey, just hit them with a hot eyelash curler and you are good to go.  Curled them once and they stayed curled all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think they have pre-glue on them, but I just dipped them slightly in the eyelash adhesive, waited until it set and got tacky, then arranged them on my eyelid and pressed for a bit and they were sealed tight and stayed all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it is silly to pay the same price for one just for the name brand when you can get ten pairs!  I will never buy name brand again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love to save money like this...bwahahahaa!!!  This is my eyelash hookup from now on, and no I am not b/sing ya, &#x27;cause I have reviewed stuff that I did not like on here and I have had no mercy with products that disappointed me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  I recommend the &#x27;Natural&#x27; ones, as I have found that the really heavy ones look overtly and obviously fake, like people would ask me, &amp;#34;are you wearing fake eyelashes??&amp;#34;  NOT the look I am going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When trimmed, these look like I have super beautiful natural lashes.  And, plus, I always put extra mascara on them to make full them pretty, but with mascara, I have control of how full...yaknowwhatimsayin..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just cut them up or use them as strips, and if too long trim the ends to whatever looks best for the look you are going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love &#x27;em!!like on here and I have had no mercy with products that disappointed me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  I recommend the &#x27;Natural&#x27; ones, as I have found that the really heavy ones look overtly and obviously fake, like people would ask me, &amp;#34;are you wearing fake eyelashes??&amp;#34;  NOT the look I am going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When trimmed, these look like I have super beautiful natural lashes.

    <li> it took a very long time to be shipped to me but it was worth it! I got them in June and they&#x27;ve lasted me for many weeks! worth the wait and money! you need to cut them to fit your eyelash line!</li>
    <li> Very Economical and ok for everyday use. They need a little touch up, but all strip lashes do.  I will never buy another  multi-pack from a retail store.  If looking good on a budget is important, this is a good way to go.</li>
    <li> Ok so im new to fake eyelashes. I looked for something that looked somewhat natural, and these are just that. They are long but not thick and halloweeny. They are on a string but to me its alot easier then the ones with a &amp;#34;strip&amp;#34;. I ordered 1box and then went back after trying diff styles and ordered 3more boxes! will always order these.</li>
    <li> Cant complain for the price. They took forever to get here since they ship from China. But if Im going to wear false lashes I sorta want them to look fake lol&lt;br /&gt;These are sort of pointless. I have tried stacking them with no change. I guess maybe if I stacked 5 pairs they might look full, but this was a pass. Dont purchase.</li>
    <li> I was please when I received my soft lashes. They were worth the wait . So natural looking ,they look like my real lashes.</li>
    <li> I would rate this as a 3.5 they r nice an natural, not hard to come off out of the package ( u know some have that sticky stuff on it). My only problem w/them is they dont have a curve shape to them and I guess maybe their not like that because the way their made I&#x27;m not sure but anyways because of this its harder to attach them to ur lids (u have to hold them in place for a couple sec. longer before removing ur hands, eyelash holder whatever u use). And @ the ends of the lashes some of them have this extra string w/a little knot very tiny but u have to cut it otherwise its bothersome when on ur lids. But they feel nice and soft once u have them on. And again great for the price.</li>
    <li> IT CAM PRETTY QUICK, FASTER THAN I THOUGHT THEY WOULD.&lt;br /&gt;THE LASHES THEMSELVES WEREN&#x27;T BAD BUT THEY&#x27;RE ATTACHED TO FLIMSY THREAD... I GUESS IT&#x27;S OK IF YOU HAVE SOME GOOD GLUE.&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, THEY WERE A BIT LONG SO I HAD TO CUT THE ENDS OFF. I ORDERED 2 BOXES SO I&#x27;LL DEFINITELY BE USING THEM. OVERALL NOT BAD FOR SUCH A LOW PRICE.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected. Really like the look. Very natural real look to the lash, will buy more in future</li>
    <li> They are perfect whether you are a novice or a beginner!  I love that I can cut them to size and reuse them over and over again!  For those of you who are not used to fake eyelashes, they may seem intensely long and can look like tarantula legs when you curl them.  However, I love these because they feel so natural, unlike the plastic Revlon lashes you would typically find at a drug store.  I highly recommend these for beauty college students who need practice!  But they are also fantastic for those who like a more natural look and like to wear them daily like I do!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving 5 stars because they came exactly as advertised and they really look natural when I apply them! Can&#x27;t go wrong with these!</li>
    <li> The thing i like about these are that they are string on the bottom, and they are not that long, so they are natural like they say and the corners that usually lift near the tear ducts stay down strongly, because it is a fiber. so it just looks like you are wearing a light eyeliner, and doesnt look so fake.</li>
    <li> They are just the right texture so they look very natural and they are long so you have to cut them to size.  I like that!</li>
    <li> if you&#x27;re looking for a natural looking this is ur lashes! i like how light it is on my eyes, unlike other drugstore lashes its kinda heavy and uncomfortable! fast shipping!</li>
    <li> They are cheap in price, and in quality as well. I dont use them because they are pretty much plastic and dont stay on.</li>
    <li> These lashes are so soft and natural looking. They can be cut to size with no problem. The bend and curve to fit the lash line. They dont feel heavy on your eyes. They can be worn with your everyday look.</li>
    <li> Lovely product. Easy to apply- flexible band</li>
    <li> I am not a false lash pro, nor am I a novice. These were extremely stiff and fairly difficult to apply however these are great for practice and give a nice semi- dramatic look</li>
    <li> These were the first eyelashes ive bought online, and from the picture they looked really natural.&lt;br /&gt;Someone who has really long lashes can pull these off just the way they are&lt;br /&gt;The lashes are really long, but they look natural, but just like every false lash, they look fake when you look down.&lt;br /&gt;I cut them so they can blend in much more with natural lashes and not look so fake, they look very natural.&lt;br /&gt;I also cut them in half and wear them, these are probably the best cheap lashes out there, so far i havent found one that is so cheap and better than these&lt;br /&gt;With my duo glue, they stay on for a long time, unlike other lashes ive bought at the store.&lt;br /&gt;They are also very lightweight, they dont feel heavy and theyre thin, which i love.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t tried the lashes yet but they did come early so that&#x27;s a plus in my book! they feel soft too  not too plasticy</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are much to long and they have some kind of thread that sticks out on the sides and the box is very flimsy</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are so amazing! They look alright, and a little natural. They go well with my eye shape (which is almond) so almond eyes, I RECOMMEND FOR YOU! I have never been so in love with eyelashes like these. They feel so light and nice, and they really helped me gain some confidence since I don&#x27;t have any eyelashes (lost them to a disorder) so I always struggled to find semi-natural lashes I could wear in the day, that looked similar to my actual eyelashes. I am so head over heels for these lashes. So worth it, and an awesome price! They look natural because they are thin and long. And they look awesome from the side too! They look way more natural than my phone can capture.</li>
    <li> I like them very natural nd they stay on they don&#x27;t look fake at all very good price would buy again</li>
    <li> Loved them! Such great quality and simple, yet cute package.</li>
    <li> I only bought one because i was skeptical, but these are awesome! Shipping was estimsated January 13 to Feb 1 and they came Dec 31 !!  Great quality for price.!! Beyond happy will be buying again.</li>
    <li> My favorite falsies. Look so natural, easy to apply and don&#x27;t feel heavy on eyelids. Love them! Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Very thin hard to apply</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the positive reviews on these lashes. Quality reflects price. These are the worst, most plastic-y, flimsiest lashes I&#x27;ve ever seen. Usually I buy the Ardell lashes in a local drugstore, but couldn&#x27;t resist this deal. They were difficult to apply (because they were basically plastic), and really spaced out. Just yuck.</li>
    <li> These lashes are cheap, badly made, barely noticeable, and the lashes are lined on literally a single string of thread. Just terrible!</li>
    <li> Bought these as a gift and my sister loves these!!!! She says they look very realistic and theyre cheap. She wants me to order her more! Lol I would reccomend them based off the reviews on here as well as how happy she was with the quality and price. Packaging is a bit simple but what more do you need?</li>
    <li> I love these eye lashes. There not very long but if u wear lengthening mascara with them the look really good. Price is great. Shipping is expensive, however the arrive in a couple of days but the packaging sucked thank goodness nothing large fell on them.</li>
    <li> This was my first time buying and using false lashes, and im very impressed!&lt;br /&gt;They came early and in perfect shape, which i was very happy with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut them in half to use on the outer part of my eye as a demi lash, and they look great!&lt;br /&gt;They are very light and easy to apply, and look natural!&lt;br /&gt;Because they are so thin, they blend right in to my normal lashes, and give it a little flare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i am very happy with these!&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid they were going to look and feel very fake, but ive been forgetting that i have them on! XD</li>
    <li> THESE ARE GREAT EYELASHES  FOR MY EYES. THE BAND IS SO THIN  NOT THICK AT ALL .  I LOVE HOW NATURAL THEY LOOK . I JUST TRIM THEM TO MY EYE SHAPE . THANK YOU !!!!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my order. Expected shipping was about a month, and I received them two days ago- five days after I placed my order.&lt;br /&gt;Not only was shipping super fast, but the lashes are excellent quality, and they look great!&lt;br /&gt;A few things I like about these lashes over others-&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;lashes&#x27; are attached to a thread instead of a plastic strip, like falsies typically are. This makes application so much easier because the thread will bend to fit the curvature of your lid. You don&#x27;t have to worry about them peeling at the edges.&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;lashes&#x27; are made of synthetic fibers, of some sort.... they look and feel completely natural. The individual lashes aren&#x27;t clumped, like you&#x27;ll see other manufacturers do. This means you can trim the lashes without them looking like huge chunks are missing. You can put them on by themselves and they&#x27;ll look beautiful, or if you&#x27;re going for a more dramatic look, just add a couple coats of mascara and they&#x27;ll look STUNNING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Looks great&lt;br /&gt;-Light weight&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;-Super fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Not enough! I WANT MOREEE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope my review was helpful! Happy shopping, ladies.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase, will order again. These are natural looking, not over done and very worth the price.</li>
    <li> Completely Love them! Very natural and light can&#x27;t even tell they are there! As a MUA I recommend these to everyone!</li>
    <li> The eyelashes are awesome, easy to apply and take off. Very natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only inconvenience to was that the packages arrived mashed i had to literally fix each eyelash. Should have it shipped with responsible people and apply to the box a label FRAGILE!!!!! THAT WOULD HAVE MADE THIS PRODUCT 100/100 EXCELLENT!!!!</li>
    <li> they were very natural looking and supper comfy !!!</li>
    <li> These are hard plastic lashes. I mean any pair from any local dollar store, Elf, LA Colors, etc. Are better. Yes, that sad. If you don&#x27;t mind looking like you a are rocking a pair you stole from your lil sisters &amp;#34;My first makeup kit&amp;#34;, go for it!</li>
    <li> Flexible and very flattering!</li>
    <li> It came two days earlier, but still took a month to came in! Very very decent for the price, they are extremely natural, like you can full anybody that you are gifted with really long eye lashes. The packaging is adorable! I like it, definitely like it. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> They look very natural but I  am new to wearing lashes and had trouble with putting them on because the band since it was pretty much just string.</li>
    <li> Natural looking. Would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. I cut then into parts and just use them to fill certain areas and it looks great!</li>
    <li> These lashes are not good at all. Terrible quality. Do not reccomend.</li>
    <li> Loved the super cute packaging. Shipping too quite a whole as usual but love the product they are the perfect length and thickness and they don&#x27;t look fake at all. The only downside is they kinda loose there curl after a while but other than that i&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> The price is good but I should&#x27;ve realized you pay or what u get. I can&#x27;t even use these they look like plastic and don&#x27;t go on very easily because of what they are made of.</li>
    <li> Loved them. Have to reorder more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering these lashes for past 3 years now.  Please don&#x27;t stop making them, they are so natural looking on my tiny lashes. I highly recommend these soft natural looking lashes, people never seem to know I am wearing them.</li>
    <li> The lashes I got are not soft at all, they have a very &amp;quot;plastic&amp;quot; feel to them, also heavy. I could feel their weight on my eyelids which felt uncomfortable. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> These are beautiful, natural-feeling lashes at a great cost.  They take mascara well and blend beautifully with natural lashes.  The lashes are connected to a thread instead of sticky plastic and are very easy to apply and lightweight to wear.  Excellent Purchase!</li>
    <li> Good for everyday use.  I can get two uses out of each pair.  Too thin for my wedding pictures though.</li>
    <li> These were great!!! I love them but they weren&#x27;t exactly reuseable to me...I only wore each pair once, they look great, but once you take them off, its kinda hard to reapply it. It wouldn&#x27;t look like they did when I first wore them. However, they are very cheap and I do reccomend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I love these lashes, they were so versatile and light weight.... not heavy and thick like most lashes.  They are very natural looking.  So if you are looking for a slight eyelash change without being too noticeable, these are perfect!</li>
    <li> Very nice natural lashes. A little harder to apply but very natural. I will buy 6 more right away. You can&#x27;t beat this deal</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these! Before these, I used to spend $7/pack on Katy Perry&#x27;s Eyelure lashes. These work just as well, and cost a lot less, too! They&#x27;re even cheaper - and look better - than mascara. Only $1.15 + free shipping! Plus, mascara tubes usually dry out after 2-3 months. These last a lot longer. One pair lasts about 3 weeks. Love them! I bought a second set to have when I use my first set up.</li>
    <li> These are PERFECT. they are natural enough looking to wear during the day, or you can add mascara to them to thicken them up for night.  such a steal because if you get lashes at Target or CVS you will pay $8 for ONE pair versus a couple bucks for 10 pairs!  They take a while to come since I think they are shipped from out of country, so order well in advance if you are planning on using for an event</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used falsies for years, and these are amazing. The look SO natural, people will question if they&#x27;re real, at least I think so. They&#x27;re so long and sweet-looking and already curl up so perfectly. Definitely buying more, they&#x27;re so gorgeous!!!</li>
    <li> If your into the Eyelash thing, this is an excellent buy.  I will be purchasing again.  Great and a natural looking lash.</li>
    <li> I would consider this fast shipping because mine came from Hong kong. These lashes are good quality especially for the price, They came in a white box as the picture shows which is pretty small. Its about 6 inches in length. As far as the lashes the ends are extra long which I do not mind because I can just cut the ends if I need to. I used two pairs one with the cut ends and I didnt have to put as much eyeliner because the ends covered it. These lashes are also short, lightweight, and thin. I have enjoyed these thus far. They are not the best quality but they serve its basic purpose.</li>
    <li> These lashes are a steal for the price! They are soft and long, look great when wearing them! they need to be trimmed before wear due to the excess track the hairs are attached to. over all if you are on the edge about these, i say go for it!</li>
    <li> These false eyelashes are a little much for me, I&#x27;d rather have less over the top falsies to wear for everyday.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different adhesives and nothing will work with these eyelashes.  Also, you have to cut them out of their place and they don&#x27;t take a great shape.  They look very false and the point of false eyelashes like these is to look like they are real.</li>
    <li> Lashes were good a nice length and really full without the fake look... i would definitely buy them again ..</li>
    <li> Not what I expected ,..very poor material n couldn&#x27;t get it on my lashes,.i guess dat what I get for paying this price</li>
    <li> I luv them. So natural looking. Not noticable at all and I plan on getting more. Keep them coming lol</li>
    <li> The price for these can not be beat! The quality of them is great and they arrived around the time that the seller said that they would. I reuse mine at least 3 or 4 times before I even throw away one pair. Only thing is that my box was a little crushed when I received it. Other than that, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Good for the price if your going for a subtle look, they are thread with lashed in them, good for a beginner!</li>
    <li> Like many mentioned, these are very soft, natural-looking lashes.  If you prefer more dramatic look and are experienced with applying thicker stiffer lashes, these are not for you.  I like them because they are affordable and easy to apply (because they are so soft, I can bend them in any shape).  Because I have eyes shaped like cartoon characters (!), I have hard time applying &amp;#34;pre-shaped&amp;#34; stiff lashes that are for foxy, almond-shaped eyes.  I thought they were re-usable but they are not.  I tried to remove the glue, wash them, etc. but I finally gave up and tossed them after one use.  Instead, I bought them in bulk.  I wish they were little more fuller.  (The whole point in wearing false lashes is to have fuller, longer and thicker lashes, but these look so natural, maybe too natural for some.  I&#x27;ve seen women who are fortunate to have longer and fuller lashes than these!  I sometimes wear two on each eye or cut them in 1/4 and add them to the outer corner of my eyes.)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have incredibly high expectations for these, as they&#x27;re little over a dollar, but I was shocked at how low-quality they are.</li>
    <li> they aren&#x27;t the ones that where shown in the picture! stupid! it wasn&#x27;t the ones I thought they were. pisses off right now!!!</li>
    <li> I really dint want to buy these lol I got a 100.00 gift card from my husband and I had about 2 dollars left so I got these because they were only about a dollar. I wear lashes and for some reason I stopped wearing them about 6 months ago so I really don&#x27;t need more BUT I did get these and I don&#x27;t regret it! The are so nice light but each lash has a lot of volume! I really got to wearing lashes again because of this product. I will be buying more lashes in the future from this buyer because they came 2 weeks earlier than anticipated! the only thing that was I guess wrong is that they came in a regular envelope with bubble wrap inside and this is more of the carriers fault than the seller but the box was crushed but the lashes where all fine and undamaged but the box was crushed right in the middle and again I guess this is more of the carriers fault than the seller. the lashes are quality and you just cant beat that price!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Edit 12/10&lt;br /&gt;As I said in my previous review that I had reordered a bunch of boxes... I ordered on 11/29 and the estimated delivery was 12/26-1/17... It arrived today!! I&#x27;m so excited. The previous person I ordered from took a few weeks and this time I ordered from Keybargains! They&#x27;re wonderful! So quick! There were a few damaged boxes but the lashes were fine so it&#x27;s okay. I officially have my year+ supply and not have to worry about them selling out for a while!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why someone commented that these make you look drag... They don&#x27;t! Not at all. It is exactly as the description says... They&#x27;re \\&quot;natural soft!\\&quot; I&#x27;ve tried on a few different styles and these are my ultimate favorite! So much so that I ordered another 50 boxes just in case they run out! They are made on a thread so I can understand why some people might say its difficult to shape or apply but honestly, the band makes wearing these lashes so comfortable! It really feels like nothing is there! Though I must say, one down side to this... The glue is harder to remove due to the band being made of thread. Even after soaking it in hot water. You have to be very patient and careful or you will rip the hairs off. Other than that, I absolutely love these lashes!</li>
    <li> love them. very flimsy but if you&#x27;re good with falsies then you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem. I&#x27;d buy again but I bought 40 so I won&#x27;t need any for a while :3</li>
    <li> I just got these in the mail and I must say, I am very impressed. The eyelashes are extremely soft, light and comfortable to wear. The backbone on them is nice and thin and really soft- arguably softer and more flexible than my ardell lashes. The lashes themselves are pretty without being too heavy or fake looking. My only issue is that they are shorter than my natural lashes. I have super long lashes, though, so it probably wouldn&#x27;t be a problem for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also very impressed by the shipping- I got mine 8 days before the estimated arrival date. Yay!</li>
    <li> I love these eyelashes they look so natural and that&#x27;s what I go for not the lashes that&#x27;s dark and looks fake I love these so much</li>
    <li> I received my order yesterday and let me tell you, they are amazing.  The band is not plastic like many other competing brands.  Lashes are threaded together and the band is the thread that is holding the lashes together.  I can&#x27;t even feel them on me.  I am Asian and I have very fine short lashes.  These lashes look very natural on me and I will definitely buy a few more boxes.</li>
    <li> I got these eyelashes yesterday and I just now tried them on, and omg they are amazing! They look completely natural and I love wearing them, the band are bendable which gives you the control on how to shape them. I applied these after I curled and apply mascara to my eyelashes. These are best applied with the Duo Adhesive, and you can re use them for about 2-3 times! I recommend these eyelashes to those who want a natural look!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy they wack!!!!</li>
    <li> better than getting think lashes, and if you hate putting on and taking off mascara- I would recommend this to people who like to take the easy route. It looks natural in a sense, it really brings out the beauty to your eyes and its long enough for round eyes. Good price, instead of paying 5 dollars for one pair of fake lashes.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it at all and haven&#x27;t used my second pair</li>
    <li> the base is literally a string and its so annoying to trim just no. I can&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m probably not even gonna use these.</li>
    <li> Love the way it looks so natural and how it blends to my eye lashes, Ino english word written on the packaging. It took  sometime before i received the package.</li>
    <li> Get these! I use these on my brides and TV shows!  They look SO REAL!!  I ordered 3 boxes and will continually get more!</li>
    <li> For a cheap price with the good item. I will definitely recommend this. I will buy more. Easy to put on, no hassle,  light on the eyes,  looks real. Suggested this to my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this eyelashes I got two pairs already and I&#x27;m gonna keep buying them I&#x27;m in loveeeeeeee , I&#x27;m this type of girl that doesn&#x27;t like fake things but this eyelashes are my favorite for the price I can&#x27;t ask for more ;) people think they&#x27;re my own. I wear them everyday I loveeeeeeee them every penny is worth it ;)</li>
    <li> i love it! it looks like their mine and the price is right.Im gonna go ahead and order some more.</li>
    <li> not like real. my wife is not using it.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes !! I am a dancer and having these on hand is always just what I need! They are a little stiff not as comfy as more expensive lashes . They last a long time I&#x27;ve worn them more than once and they blend nicely  with my natural lashes.</li>
    <li> A little too thin but still ok</li>
    <li> These came quickly, and the packaging was adorable.  I&#x27;m very excited to try these and these appear to be very natural.</li>
    <li> They are very useable and affordable.  I wanted a natural length.....they are kinda glamorish and not a natural looking length.  I will try to find something in a more natural length next time.  But if you like longer than natural lashes....these are well worth it. They work well and seem to be very durable.</li>
    <li> They feel like real human eye lashes I love them!</li>
    <li> Shipping takes a while but definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;The lashes are not too thick not clumpy and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love these.  You can&#x27;t beat the price!  They look beautiful and natural.  Shipping took about 4 weeks, but it was worth the wait. I will be ordering more soon because by the time they get here I&#x27;m probably gonna be ready for more.  If you get these, you won&#x27;t regret it. They are great for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even need to provide a picture because they&#x27;re the same as everyone else&#x27;s. They&#x27;re really great, flexible, and natural looking. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> It was a little thinner than I would have liked, but the lashes are in great shape. They are a bit on the long side, so you&#x27;re going to have to cut them a little to fit your eyes. However, if you&#x27;re going for a natural look for your eyelashes, you should definitely buy these. They don&#x27;t rip when you try to pull them off your eyes either.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a thicker look, I suggest you find another pair or double up on these! Will definitely buy these again!!</li>
    <li> I just purchased this set of 10 Natural Soft False Eyelashes for the second time because my first set finally ran out. I only wear false eyelashes for special occasions, and with these I was able to re-use the same pair 3-5 times. These eyelashes look full and long, but not overdone as some do. If you are looking for big-and-bold lashes, I would try a different style. Initially I was skeptical about buying these, because the price was so low and I was afraid the quality would be the same. But after seeing good reviews, I figured I would give them a try and if I did not like them, it would only be a couple dollars lost. It turned out that I like these better than the ones available at my local beauty supply store. One thing unique about these is that the lashes are attached to a thick black thread, instead of the usual plastic strip. The thread allows for more flexibility during the application process, and they seem to hold better than the plastic strip. Previously I have had the issue of the strip lifting after a few hours of wear, but not with these. The only downside to these is that the thread is too long on both sides, and you have to trim them off with scissors. Not a big problem, but that is the only thing that holds me back from giving these a 5 star review.</li>
    <li> In the picture, they look very natural. However, they are extremely long. I turned on pair into half-lashes and although I would not wear them on an everyday basis, I think they would work well for very dramatic makeup</li>
    <li> This product is good, I did have to cut them down a bit on the sides to get rid of the excess strings however they do look very nice and not over the top.</li>
    <li> Cant beat the price and delivery time was faster than i expected... They are nice and thin .  I put a couple of coats of mascara and WOW.  Great investment , would recommend to anyone who loves false lashes... Very flexable easy to put on . Those with bad reviews may need to watch tutorial in regards to applying false lashes ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to vender and amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> Poor quality truly disposable use them and throw them away.  They have a flimsy thread that holds them together so hard to put on take off and keep there shape.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t expect much for the price, but these are pretty cheap.  I ripped one trying to adjust it. They also aren&#x27;t the best material, almost like they are made out of thread.  They aren&#x27;t horrible, as they are very subtle and blend with your natural lashes to look more natural.  If you are looking for something thick and glamorous, this isn&#x27;t the lash you want.  They also too forever to show up in the mail .</li>
    <li> um first of this item comes exactly how its seen . Its very cheap looking but &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&#x27;&#x27;</li>
    <li> I love these lashes. I&#x27;ve been doing chemo treatments for over a year and thus have been using fake lashes for just as long. I was previously using Ardell lashes (at $3.50 per pair) but ordered these just to check them. Even if I hated them, they are so inexpensive it wouldn&#x27;t have mattered.  I use them exclusively now! After my initial order I came back and ordered 3 more packs (30 pairs).  I&#x27;ve received more compliments with these lashes than I ever did with the Ardell lashes.  Those who know that I wear falsies always comment on how natural they look. I can usually get two wears out of each pair. You definitely have to trim them to fit your eye, but I found that I had to do that with all brands I&#x27;ve tried.  I highly recommend these. Side bonus-they ship really fast.</li>
    <li> These are very pretty and look very natural but I CANNOT get them to stay on with eyelash glue. I have tried two different types and they just won&#x27;t stick. Any suggestions on a brand to use?</li>
    <li> these actually look very natural, if you pump them up with lots of mascara they get more dramatic but they can also be pretty subtle (for false lashes) if you don&#x27;t adorn them. long enough to trim to fit any eye, make sure you trim the little bits on the end before applying. great value!!!</li>
    <li> But for the price............</li>
    <li> What a bargin! The drugstore charges 5-10 bucks for 1 pair</li>
    <li> If you love lashes these are the lashes for you.....inexpensive and they look very natural.....second time buying these....no more drug store lashes for me</li>
    <li> I have somewhat medium eyelashes. these are as long as mine so I kind of dont like them. But it&#x27;ll do</li>
    <li> Hated them, they feel and look to fake. Eyelashes are too thin and when you try to take them out of the box it comes in they rip.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend really liked those pairs of fake eyelashes. She says they are really comfortable No ichi sensation red eyes tearing etc . If you ask me I can say she look damm beautiful in them. Girls go for it...cheers</li>
    <li> Very soft and light . I love this style . You have to trim them though . I love the price for this product.</li>
    <li> These are great. I had them for a couple months now. You cant beat the quality for the price you pay. These lashes were basically a steal. They&#x27;re simple enough for daily use but can be glammed up with some mascara.  I recommend these lashes for cosplayers because they&#x27;re really durable with the right lash glue!  I slept in them and they didnt crumble up (im a really wild sleeper btw). I would definitely purchase from here again.</li>
    <li> Wish I could say these were amazing but they are flimsy and do not go on well at all. Ibuse a lot of eyelashes and these are just not great or usable.</li>
    <li> the spine on the lashes is literally a piece of string. Need to trim it when you get. I had to yank it off the package to get it off which in turn damages the lashes. cheap but it guess it lives up to it&#x27;s pricing.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t use these..TOO flimsey and too hard too get out of package.. I have no thing else to say so...</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Takes a loooooong time to ship but, again, for the price they are great.</li>
    <li> Very affordable! They are so easy to put on and love how they look so natural and feel so light on. I just purchased another pack and will be looking forward to buying more! 😃</li>
    <li> for the price it works for parties</li>
    <li> Natural looking. Almost forgot they werent real and the price point be was amazing as well.No doubt I Would buy again.</li>
    <li> i can not wait to use them. they look great. it is too bad that they don&#x27;t come with the special glue to put them on</li>
    <li> This product was not actually purchased for me. I purchased it for my girlfriend who loves wearing false eyelashes to enhance her already beautiful eyes.  When I purchased these, I was slightly worried about getting fake eyelashes off of Amazon. They were not a ton of reviews so I was worried about the quality of them. Needless to say, these are great quality!  They look great on my girlfriend and she absolutely loves them.  They feel and look very natural. They are also very easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good deal on fake eyelashes that don&#x27;t make you look like you walked out of a Vegas show room, these are the way to go.</li>
    <li> I love these. Great price, they arrived sooner than promised. I ordered 10 boxes the second time.&lt;br /&gt;I wear these for several days before I need to go for a fresh set.</li>
    <li> These lashes are perfect! Great for everyday wear, they look so natural, yet they add the perfect amount of length to look glamorous. I like to cut them into pieces and individually apply, but they are comfortable when worn as a strip as well. I wear these everyday and i love them! Will DEFINITELY order again</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and natural looking. For more added effect, I double up on the lashes. Still looks natural but exaggerated which is great for going out without having to buy different eyelashes if you still want the natural look.</li>
    <li> I had to clip the edges of the string-like base that they are attached to (which is no big deal) but my favorite part is that  you can&#x27;t see the seam or anything when you are wearing them so they look completely natural! Well except they are very long. I love them!</li>
    <li> Cute, but a lil long easy fix though..just trim the,</li>
    <li> Item was as described. Shipped within time frame.</li>
    <li> Love them!! I just received them today and the shipping was fast and they are very soft and natural. I ordered them on the 6th and i got them on the 23.</li>
    <li> Overall, the product was okay considering its very low price, but the false eyelashes did not compare in quality to the ones available in the U.S. except that they could be cleaned and reused a greater number of times. The ratio of lash volume to lash length was off and unnatural.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! So beautiful and natural looking &amp; super easy to put on!</li>
    <li> Took so long to get here and look like plastic, they somehow looked natural when they are applied</li>
    <li> Took a while to ship. I actually forgot about it, then was surprised when it came. The only reason im giving it 3 stars is because the lashes look natural and didn&#x27;t really make my eyes pop. Guess its not my style. Definitely worth the cheap price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these lashes. I use them for my makeup business all of the time, they are my go to product.  Although they are cheap in price, the quality is fantastic. They are very natural looking but add just enough flare to really complete any look. I recently ordered 7 packages but only received 1 so I contacted the seller. The seller responded immediately and was such a pleasure to work with. I have just received the remainder of my order and could not be happier. I definitely recommend trying this product.</li>
    <li> These are medium in weight and thickness, however they are not very LONG.  Definitely are for Asian eye shape.  I am not impressed with the lashes for myself, but if you have super blonde lashes, or super short lashes, it is a great deal.  I was looking for length.</li>
    <li> I just tried on these lashes and they are crazy comfortable. I needed to snip the extra band on the sides but they fit my eye perfectly. I&#x27;m really new to false eyelashes but I will keep buying these as long as the seller keeps selling them. I don&#x27;t feel like I have anything on and they are so flexible to my eye. they are cheap and amazing.</li>
    <li> It is fair enough. Good product, good price.</li>
    <li> They look natural without masacara, but they don&#x27;t stick very well. I&#x27;ve used the same glue for years, an haven&#x27;t had this issue. We&#x27;ll see because they&#x27;re new.</li>
    <li> These are great to have!</li>
    <li> I thought glue was going to come with it , so now I got to buy the glue and its ok</li>
    <li> Love love love.. natural.  I will be ordering enough to last for the next six months. Will recommend to other&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I use these for everyday</li>
    <li> Looks very natural but long enough and cute curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very thin. If you paste fake lashes on every day I recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping time and rate ....its  okay..</li>
    <li> My daughter bought these and she loves them.</li>
    <li> just as it showed on  the pics. Very nice and good quality . Like it a lot. I will recommend my friend to buy</li>
    <li> I know this product is cheap but the quality is very bad.  even just looking at it from the packaging itself looks bad.  i tried on one pair and i threw out the rest.</li>
    <li> I like in jersey . Not a thing to dislike about this product . Very affordable . Good investment I will gladly buy more in the near future ! 😍💳</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are A-MA-ZING!!!! I bought them just to try out since I&#x27;m not really a lash person. But, ever since I put them on I can&#x27;t stop wearing them. They have a great natural look. I wore them for a week straight and they are reusable depending on how much glue you use. I will definitely but a few more boxes just to stick up while they&#x27;re cheap lol!!!!</li>
    <li> the eyelashes themselves are great, but they took ages to ship</li>
    <li> I normally order these types of lashes and usually I&#x27;m extremely pleased however this package came folded in half which ruined some of the lashes. These were unusually thin and I won&#x27;t be able to use them. I&#x27;m very disappointed and will not order again</li>
    <li> These are great and I can reuse each pair a couple of times.  These look very natural and definitely a great bargain.</li>
    <li> These are very lovely and natural looking.  They look like lashes some women have naturally without mascara.  You know the ladies who lashes are just naturally long and thick and dark?  That&#x27;s what they look like. No mascara is needed for a natural beauty look but mascara would definitely take you to the night-out-on-the-town look.</li>
    <li> This review is for Style 0. If you have no eyelashes due to alopecia, trichotillomania, or chemotherapy, these are the lashes for you. Due to trich, I have no lashes but because I wear glasses I can&#x27;t have crazy long falsies, since they invariably hit my lenses and drive me batty. Style 0 is perfect for me. They look entirely natural, are the right length and thickness, and are super cheap. If you want the best glue ever made, buy SecureHold brand. It&#x27;s latex free and holds all day without becoming gooey or losing adhesion.</li>
    <li> Cheap eye lashes don&#x27;t recommend them!!</li>
    <li> Very thin threw in the garbage</li>
    <li> I bought these and didn&#x27;t really know what to expect. Took a while to ship but when I got them, it was worth the wait. I cut each in half and use half on each eye. It looks so natural but adds that little bit extra. Goes on easily because they are really flexible.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in good time and looked as pictured but does not adhere well or stay on.</li>
    <li> I love my eyelashes can&#x27;t. Wait to try. Them. On</li>
    <li> i just got my eyelashes and im super happy with the buy i had ordered them on dec 28,2012 and it came faster than i expected which is jan 11,2013 they had said it would arrive by jan 22 to feb but came before( no damages or anything). which i had no problem because there sending them from far. anyway the eyelashes are nice they give you a really natural look which i so love. they are a bit harder to put but with patience it will do you also gootta be careful when taking them out you dont wanna just rip them out or else of course theyll get messed up you just trim the edges before applying them  and thats it :) but overall super nice they dont make you look all dramatic</li>
    <li> The eyelashes are really natural looking. However, the line where you apply the eyelashes glue, is kinda thick so when you wear it, you can feel the thick line there. It gets quite uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> These are very light and natural looking especially for day time.  If i need something fuller for night I just use a little heavier eyeliner.  They look like my own lashes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these before and was in love. However, this time these are very thin but if you use two it&#x27;ll look fine.</li>
    <li> Exactly what it says on the description. They look natural to me, they&#x27;re not dramatic. I purchased them for length to wear on special occasions buy they&#x27;re really the same length as my real lashes. Gives me volume though. Its my first time attempting fake lashes so I had and still have difficulties with them. So it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem to apply them if you know what you&#x27;re doing. The only thing that&#x27;s negative is the shipping time. It took nearly two months or more to arrive. But since the shipping was free I didn&#x27;t mind. Although there is always a bit of anxiety from the long wait and no tracking # .</li>
    <li> A little longer than I expected. Not really for me. But, I loved the band on them. Easy and flexible.</li>
    <li> They were good eyelashes for the price, they are very thin though.</li>
    <li> Very nice good quality</li>
    <li> Got these for my best friend who wears lashes everyday and she loves them, very soft and realistic.</li>
    <li> I love them , they&#x27;re super soft and look natural.</li>
    <li> I love these.  Just ordered 3 more.</li>
    <li> Loved them and they look super natural. They makemy eyes pop without being over the top. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> If you want natural everyday lashes that are EXTREMELY soft then purchase these! I&#x27;m very happy with the product and delivery time. The band is super thin and they are very flexabile. I&#x27;m an avid review reader before I purchase anything and trust me for the price you can&#x27;t beat it! I will definitely be purchasing these again!</li>
    <li> very realistic looking&lt;br /&gt;not to thick and very long&lt;br /&gt;nice thin track makes it very easy to hide with a bit if eyeliner</li>
    <li> these hold up well with many uses and cut to size they are a great buy</li>
    <li> Well ladies and ladyboys, I have been wearing these lashes 3-4 days a week for about 2 weeks now. I am liking the lashes and have definitely gotten compliments on them, but there are just a couple things you should know before you buy them. What I like is of course the price for the amount of product. I bought 2 boxes of them. The length is nice too- I would say a natural, definitely noticeable, medium-long length and buildable because they are not too thick so you can wear one pair for a nice day look (I&#x27;m a nurse so I can&#x27;t go in my patients&#x27; rooms looking crazy) and if you&#x27;re going somewhere at night add a second pair for a more full look. What you do need to know about them is that they are on a thread-like material. They are packaged well, but when you pull them out of the box to put them on it you aren&#x27;t careful the lashes move around on that thread (they don&#x27;t fall off they just move) and you have to move the lashes on the thread back into place which I&#x27;m not so good at. I was a little too rough with one and had to toss it-I couldn&#x27;t get the lashes spaced right. You will have to trim the thread on every lash on each side when you release them from the package and they are on the longer side so if you have smaller eyes you will need to trim more. Usually buy drugstore or MAC lashes and these are definitely different but I like them. I have reworn each pair twice and could get more use out of them but I choose to toss them. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Very pretty lashes and they fit perfectly. This is a great set of fake lashes!</li>
    <li> very hard to apply and cheaply made</li>
    <li> This is my second order on these lashes they look so natural, I love them so much</li>
    <li> They are equivalent to the MAC Eyelashes.</li>
    <li> good eyelashes for daily basis.. its hard to put on cuz its thread but i like them for work .. i dont mind buying them again ........</li>
    <li> Love &#x27;em!!! I like to use them for every day wear!! no fake lashes look natural it makes your eyes pop and i like it</li>
    <li> I really love these lashes!  Iv been using one pair and wear them everyday. They stay on and don&#x27;t look fake like other lashes. They&#x27;re soft and light.  If i want a bit more oomf i put a layer of mascara on them and im set. I don&#x27;t have to worry about losing them because i have the rest as back up. Overall I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These lashes are very comfortable and easy to apply!</li>
    <li> Love these lashes great for beginners</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE THIS LASHES!!!&lt;br /&gt;I WEAR LASHES EVERYDAY AND I LOVE THIS!!! PERFECT PRICE! THEY ARE COMFORTABLE AND EASY TO WORK WITH!!! I WILL DEFINITELY STACK UP!!!</li>
    <li> Love it . Will order again</li>
    <li> LOVE these lashes. gives a natural everyday look. doesnt have a thick band so it doesnt feel like youre wearing anything (:</li>
    <li> These are a bit awkward. They are made of string, and they&#x27;re hard too put on, But if you know how to put them on i think they&#x27;ll be a good buy.</li>
    <li> I brought these eyelashes to keep my stock full...the quality is soft and the look great on....better than the ones I brought from the beauty supply store..,the more the better</li>
    <li> These are very natural looking and don&#x27;t need lots of trimming.  They are easy to apply with applicator (not included).  Spacing is even and the tone is fine with or without mascara.  Shipped quickly too!</li>
    <li> LOOKS SO REAL! The lash and is not that thick so you can easily get away with it using eyeliner. you have to trim the edges to get perfect fit for your eyes. this will make you look gorgeous without looking too fake. the lashes itself is very light, but you can build up the thickness and length with mascara. Feels like HUMAN HAIR &amp;#60;3 DEF MY GO TO LASHES ! super natural((:</li>
    <li> Delicate hair line, arrived promptly, look more natural than other similar products I have purchased.</li>
    <li> Totally love this eyelashes they are very confortable amd totally look natural... I just love this</li>
    <li> LOVE these. Soooo many for the price I&#x27;d normally pay for 1/2 a pair at a beauty store! &amp; they feel just like name brand lashes. I can&#x27;t tell a difference &amp; neither can anyone else c;</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking I might try them but the stupid things had no glue with them.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Very affordable and theres so many of them! Very natural looking but if you want more thicker lashes and for them to be more noticeable i just layer them on usually 2 pairs will be good enough for me for an everyday look. These are the only lashes I purchase, unfortunately every time i have bought more they seem to be different every time. not much of a problem for me because  its not really noticeable. but definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> so cute but it just takes awhile to ship.</li>
    <li> Great looking and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes! They are super natural looking and look great on. If you like the naural looking lashes these are for you.I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I got them. I would definitely buy this over and Over again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really nice and a great price. Although the eyelashes might be a bit fake so I would trim it a little before using it but compare to the fake lashes I have used before, this one is more realistic.</li>
    <li> I was surprised during the shipping there was no padding or bubble wrap at all but my lashes did come in safely intact. Personally I like how the lash&#x27;s band is really thin,it just adds on to the natural feel. The lashes are indeed soft to the touch and do not have a harsh textures compared to other. They are really natural looking and add a bit more length to your real lashes. I would repurchase these again!&lt;br /&gt; It can be a little difficult at first when you first put them on due to the thin band,but with a little bit of patients it will work out fine. I am able to reuse them for only 2-3 times but for how cheap I bought them I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> These are okay lashes. They&#x27;re easy to apply and are natural looking. I would recommend curling them once they are on so you can really make them pop. My only complaint is they are not quite full enough to my liking. They blend right in so you can&#x27;t really tell my lashes are any fuller from the start, but if you curl them and add mascara then they do pop out a bit more. They&#x27;re not bad at all though for the price. I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again personally, but they were a good one time purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soft, it&#x27;s cheap, but it sure is hard to put on!&lt;br /&gt;It may be because I&#x27;m fairy inexperienced at falsies but it&#x27;s definitely flimsy and I&#x27;ve found it pretty difficult to put on.</li>
    <li> Its LITERALLY a piece of string with lashes. They are very flimsy.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that their natural lashes, and not humongous big and dark lashes. They are very soft, and add that perfect touch to really bring out your eyes. I do recommend xo</li>
    <li> Natural looking! Love it</li>
    <li> These eyelashes arrived in a cute small box where they were neatly held and not damaged. The eyelashes are very natural looking just like ones you&#x27;d find at the drug store! They do not have a synthetic plastic feel to it but rather a gentle, soft, and feathery one. I recommend these to anyone who wishes to wear eyelashes during the day! They come attached to a string so you must be prepared to have a pair of scissors with you to cut them shorter because they are long. Other than that, they are easy to apply and bend to the curve of your upper eye lid!</li>
    <li> They are not as long as I expected, but very natural looking.  They also have great bands which make them lay very nicely along the lash line.  Good for a  freelance kit just because there are so many for the price. They also look great with mascara and don&#x27;t clump up but look really authentic.  I prefer my lashes longer for personal use but again, they are great for a kit.</li>
    <li> These lashes are to long for my eyes, I had to trim them a lot to fit my eyes. I also, found them to be a little difficult to place the glue on, because the line is so small, you have to remove a lot of glue</li>
    <li> they are great lashes! they did take a little while for them to arrive but they def look great!&lt;br /&gt;I would def recommend and will probably be ordering again!</li>
    <li> Lash strip is straight--needs more curve. Lashes appear well made otherwise. Haven&#x27;t tried to use yet.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for over 8 months now and I love then, they are very thin so they are not real real thick or heavy and they are easy to apply, only thing which is nothing to me they come long so you may have to cut them down if you have small eyes like me.  Last all day used makeup remover to get off whit ease, no tugging.  Shipping took 3 weeks but worth the wait and very natural looking.  Very happy</li>
    <li> After trimming these, because they are unnaturally long in width, these lashes looked very pretty.  They enhanced my eyes without making me looking too fake.  The fibers of the lashes themselves are great and don&#x27;t look thick and plastic-like. I was able to wear them without eyeliner and it looks fantastic. You get so many for such a cheap price it is a steal! The shipment did take a while to get here, but that&#x27;s expected since it&#x27;s not coming from the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for some added oomph to your lashes without looking like a \\&quot;drag queen\\&quot; or fake, I say go with these. Just remember to trim them! That&#x27;s important :)</li>
    <li> My daughter wants to buy more!</li>
    <li> Such a bargain ! Very happy</li>
    <li> Just what I was expecting :)  Only down fall is, getting the product took a while to receive.</li>
