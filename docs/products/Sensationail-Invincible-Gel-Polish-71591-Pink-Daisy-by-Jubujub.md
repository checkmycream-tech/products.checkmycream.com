    <li> Worst gel polish I&#x27;ve used. I regularly buy sensationail gel polish. This one chipped within a few days, very unusual. Maybe it&#x27;s old. Other colors I&#x27;ve purchased in the past come with an orange stick but not this one. On the bright side, it was a cute color to wear for Easter, was simple to apply, as are all sensationail gels.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a girl who loves her pink. Great shade and great price. I do my own gels at home and would rather spend $25 building my own color collection than a one time visit to the nail salon.</li>
    <li> Color is a little different than it shows.</li>
    <li> I used to get my gel nails done at a salon. $35 each time. About a month ago, I purchased the Sensationail system. It is easy to use and the polish stays as well as the gel polish from the spa but so much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Color is quite pretty! Can&#x27;t wait to use it! Came in faster than expected which is great! The price was great also! :) will order again soon!</li>
    <li> The pink daisy color nail gel looks fabulous! I did my nails a week ago and they still look great!</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly.  Product as described. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I had no idea how small .25 fluid oz. was. When I opened the package, this bottle was about 1/3 the size of a regular polish. Good polish but it will last only through about 3-4 manicures.</li>
    <li> Loved everything about this order.  The color is almost a dusky rose or damask rose.  I can see me needing another bottle easily.  The seller was prompt and the packaging perfect.  Great all the way around.</li>
    <li> Very pretty color. Like it so much that I&#x27;ve worn only this color since I got it.</li>
    <li> Loved the color could not find this color in the store, will order again from this seller . This product works just like the other nail polish that I got with my starter kit</li>
    <li> This was my first foray into gel mani/pedis and bought this to supplement my initial Sensational kit. It&#x27;s not bad but I have since moved up and have been using OPI and Essie gels as of late.</li>
    <li> Love this color, great price and fast delivery time. Thank you</li>
    <li> It don&#x27;t last no two weeks.</li>
    <li> Love this brand of gel polish &amp; the color is really pretty! Arrived quickly too!</li>
    <li> This polish goes on easily.  You must have a UV light to set the polish.  This polish was more like cherry red than pink.  It will last for one to two weeks.  You can peel it off when you use a reg. clear polish on nails before applying gel.  It will take up to five min. to set.  Nails will be somewhat tacky for about one half hour after setting.</li>
    <li> The seller was excellent to work with. The lamp works really well, but the nail polish chips easily and removal and reapplication is fairly onerous.</li>
    <li> its nail polish.. great color</li>
    <li> Love and much cheaper on line</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cure well at home.</li>
    <li> The color is brighter than the box but I am smitten with it. Very nice.</li>
