      <li>To be honest, I can&#x27;t tell if it helps makes my hair have more volume or not.</li>

      <li>Love the three together and recommend it to all who want their hair to be a bit thicker.</li>
      <li>Great shampoo that really works.  </li>
      <li>Something in most conditioners and shampoos bothers it but not this.</li>
      <li>This is better.</li>
      <li>and i started losing more hair because of dryness.</li>
      <li>are okay,</li>
      <li>I am glad that I can order it because they don,t always have it in the store.</li>

      <li>One of my favorite shampoos.</li>
      <li>I bought this shampoo for much more from a  duane</li>
      <li>The price at Amazon for this product is much better</li>
      <li>Sincerely, I cannot picture life without this stuff.</li>
      <li>I read most of the reviews on here and it seems to work for most people regardless of race or hair type.</li>
      <li>However, they do make a wonderful lather- which doesnt actually do anything</li>
      <li>I tried a sample of carroll&#x27;s daughter shampoo and it didn&#x27;t tangle my hair but it costs 20buck or more.</li>
      <li>She doesn&#x27;t notice much of a difference and the smell isn&#x27;t that great.  </li>
      <li>but I found out that diluting it in a bit of water was making my hair more manageable.</li>
      <li>and very friendly price tag.</li>
      <li>I really liked another Loreal shampoo in a gold and brown tube because it was sulfate free and did wonders on my fine hair.</li>
      <li>I now don&#x27;t have to clean out my shower after every wash, and I&#x27;m not scratching at my head all day!  </li>
      <li>Nice fresh smell.</li>
      <li>but if you&#x27;re concerned, it isn&#x27;t as strong on the hair as it is out of bottle.</li>
      <li>but, even though this one is a bit strong, it didn&#x27;t make me sneeze or otherwise bother me like some scents do.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I tend not to like strong fragrances</li>
      <li>shampoo has a strong, rosemary-ish smell which I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
      <li>I missed Beauty Brands liter sale and got this when debating whether or not to hand over full price for my favorite salon brand.</li>
      <li>Best thickening Shampoo 4 Thinning hair, Even helps ur hair grow, highly recommend you know the old saying you get what you pay for this</li>

      <li>I know it&#x27;s sulfate free</li>
      <li>I prefer sulfate free shampoos, which is why I prefer Avalon&#x27;s line of organic shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, but this L&#x27;Oreal shampoo is one I can&#x27;t recommend under any circumstances.</li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s cheap for one</li>
      <li>As with Avalon shampoos, it is cruelty free, gluten free, non GMO and certified organic.</li>
      <li>Having trouble finding in stores, so this is the perfect solution.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like this shampoo because itmakes my hair color last longer. It gives volume but I found out that diluting it in a bit of water was making my hair more manageable. I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> It did make my hair feel thick everytime I used it and the smell is amazing. But it made my hair shed A LOT. My hair didn&#x27;t even shed before I started using this but as soon as I started it was just bad. I almost cried at how much it made my hair shed after every use. There&#x27;s so much left in the bottle but it&#x27;s too bad I won&#x27;t be using it anymore.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo, and the price was good. I bought this because my Bed Head sulfate free shampoo ran out and I&#x27;ve been strapped for money so didn&#x27;t want to spend as much this time around. Works good, no complaints here.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to realize why my scalp and back began to itch, but the more I used this L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s &amp;#34;sulfate-free&amp;#34; shampoo/conditioner, my scalp and back began to itch incessantly!! It&#x27;s truly unbearable. And this has never happened to me! I&#x27;ve never had a problem with dry, itchy scalp or dandruff. I&#x27;m about to throw those bottles away, run to walgreens for shampoo &amp; conditioner, and take a shower right now (despite not needing one and really needing to study for law school finals) just because I&#x27;m so miserable. Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells great (mild herb smell) that isn&#x27;t too perfume-y. Hair feels (appears) softer and fuller after using. This is especially helpful to combat the strong styling paste I need to use on my stubborn head.</li>
    <li> Salon-like quality shampoo!</li>
    <li> Good price. Having trouble finding in stores, so this is the perfect solution.</li>
    <li> I just love this product. In the past, I have used a lot of non- sulfate shampoos since I had cysteine or keraton . For some reason I missed the foamy feel with those shampoos and felt like they left a residue on my hair. This shampoo makes my hair feel absolutely clean and fresh and ofcourse dense. I have recently purchased 2 other variations (for smoothing and rejuvenating hair) and cant wait to try those..will review when I do</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man in early 40s.. this shampoo is awesome!</li>
    <li> The men in my house love this for their hair. I have long hair and don&#x27;t love it as much, seems to leave a lot of flyaways. Maybe cleans too well? I do love that a little bit creates alot of thick suds, and it smells OK.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair and this  is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually made my hair feel thicker.  I love it!</li>
    <li> My baby fine, thin, more salt than pepper colored hair does seem thicker. I am hoping as I continue using the shampoo, it will thicken more.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo (and the conditioner) exclusively for years. Sulfate free is crucial to me. My hair was breaking and falling out before, and is now thick and full even at age 63.</li>
    <li> Best thickening Shampoo 4 Thinning hair, Even helps ur hair grow, highly recommend you know the old saying you get what you pay for this is the best makes your hair shiny healthy and look straight and strong would buy it again and again and again, S.I.N.Y.LADYRIDER Thank u, but right now I&#x27;m over-the-top in shampoo,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling for years to find a shampoo that works with my very thin hair.  Most of shampoos weigh it down or by the end of the day my hair is oily and gross.  I have been using this for a month and just ordered my second bottle.  My hair feels thicker and its soft and shiny (not oily).  Plus I&#x27;m not having any of the oily gross problems as before.  So happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair volume and it lathers up so good.  Has a great smell and it&#x27;s sulfate free.  Adds body to my fine, limp hair.</li>
    <li> I had a thinning hair problem (caused by an overdose of Vitamin A).  I read that rosemary oil was good for thinning hair so I bought the essential oil as a hair treatment.  Then I saw that this shampoo had rosemary oil in it and no sulfates so I bought it and the conditioner.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, I could tell the difference in about a week.  It might have been the essential oil treatment AND this shampoo that caused the difference but I&#x27;m still using this shampoo even though I&#x27;ve resolved the thinning hair issue. Some people might have to get used to the smell which initially struck me as \\&quot;medicinal\\&quot;.  But once the hair is washed and dried, the smell isn&#x27;t as strong and I personally like it - to me it makes my hair smell fresh and clean. Hope L&#x27;Oreal doesn&#x27;t stop making this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this products for month, my hair is healthier than before.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great shampoo, does thicken the hair..</li>
    <li> This shampoo not only keeps my hair clean, but for the first time ever I found a thickener that actually works. And this is after 35 years of searching.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this, and it&#x27;s now my go-to shampoo.  I always alternate with another brand/type when I run out of one to keep build up from becoming too much of a problem (as that can weigh down fine hair) but I haven&#x27;t been liking any of the others I&#x27;ve tried before or after using this.  It&#x27;s not a miracle worker but it does what it says enough to keep me returning to it.</li>
    <li> The first use, I really liked it! After that it didn&#x27;t seem to thicken my hair like it did on the first use.</li>
    <li> After I gave birth, my hair and scalp were a hot mess.  I was breaking out in this little hard white balls that I would obsessively scratch at all day.  My hair was also falling out in clumps.  I was using my husband&#x27;s Head and Shoulders scalp therapy, but it seemed to be making my hair greasy.  I decided to attack my problems one step at a time.  Of course my vanity won out and I decided to tackle the hair loss first.  Much to my surprise, this shampoo has made an almost immediate difference in both my scalp breakouts and hairloss.  I now don&#x27;t have to clean out my shower after every wash, and I&#x27;m not scratching at my head all day!  Love this shampoo.  It&#x27;s worked better than any high end salon brand I&#x27;ve tried in my quest.</li>
    <li> This has been wonderful for my thin hair. It leaves softness without being heavy.  I&#x27;ve tried more expensive products and they don&#x27;t work half as well.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I can&#x27;t tell if it helps makes my hair have more volume or not. I kind of doubt it. But I will say that it has a nice clean smell (I am very sensitive to fragrances, so a natural smell is important to me) and it rinses out very easily.</li>
    <li> I have kept a hair catcher over the drain in my shower for the last few years. Before I started using this product I had to clean it out every 4-6 days from all the hair clogging it. If I was lazy I could probably go a full two weeks now without having to clean the hair catcher out! This shampoo and conditioner have made a major measurable difference. I ran out, started to use trader joes sulfate free shampoo, and my hair began falling out again. I have very fine straight/wavy hair. Hope this product stays out for forever because I never want to use another shampoo.</li>
    <li> Amazing For your hair!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite shampoos. It does what shampoos are supposed to: Cleans my hair without over-stripping or damaging. The plus is that is also helps with hair loss.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo, and could not see any thickening effect.  I have very thin hair, due to some hair loss (female) and inherently baby fine hair.  I used the L&#x27;Oreal thickening shampoo with the L&#x27;Oreal thickening conditioner and thickening tonic.  None of the three products worked for me, either together or separately.</li>
    <li> I have fine, somewhat thick straight hair.  I like a shampoo that can give my hair some body so I decided to give this a try.  I have to be honest when I say I was expecting a lot more.  I didn&#x27;t notice any extra body and it&#x27;s just an average shampoo in my opinion.  Definitely not worth 5 or 6 dollars.  It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell &amp; doesn&#x27;t produce a very good lather.  I know it&#x27;s sulfate free and this may contribute to the lack of lather.  It might work better for someone else with very thin hair.</li>
    <li> At first, I thought this was working. It does thicken my fine, thin hair, but not any more so than my Salon Grafix Conditioning Cleansing for Oily or fine hair, which is my absolute favorite, but hard to come by in local stores. After a while, I started to notice how dry the mid to end of my hair was, and it was all because of this product and the conditioner within the same line. I have greasy hair on my crown, but have always had normal hair elsewhere, but this dried it out so bad, without doing anything for my grease at the same time. I completely cut this out of my hair routine, and just started using the salon grafix one once more, and now my hair is back to normal. I thought this shampoo would work well because it&#x27;s sulfate free, but I was wrong.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s working, although I can&#x27;t attribute it to this one product specifically - I&#x27;m using the whole set. My hair feels thicker, at the very least!</li>
    <li> First of all, it&#x27;s really great, especially for thinning hair. It adds volume without adding weight or grease (flaws lots of thickening shampoos have). My hair looks silky and smooth, and the most amazing thing I love about this shampoo - it smells like something very nice from my childhood. Now I believe I will be only using this one, kinda addicted to this wonderful smell. :)</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo it does wonders for thin hair. I am glad that I can order it because they don,t always have it in the store.</li>
    <li> This is a cream shampoo, but as is typical for thickening shampoos, this shampoo is too drying for my already dry hair. Gave me a full but puffy look. I need more moisture than this shampoo provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice and lathers and cleans well. I think it would be ideal for oily, thin hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly for the smell and the fact that it&#x27;s sulfate free without really paying attention to the fact that it was thickening. Luckily it&#x27;s just what I needed! I love it, after the first wash my hair really does feel and look thicker. It&#x27;s soothing on my scalp. I read complaints about how it&#x27;s greasy but I&#x27;m guessing they used too much of the product all at once, a little goes a long way. I personally like that the scent isn&#x27;t super feminine but if you&#x27;re concerned, it isn&#x27;t as strong on the hair as it is out of bottle. Will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I don&#x27;t know why it feels that way while i&#x27;m shampooing. IT also doesn&#x27;t seem to thicken my hair at all either.</li>
    <li> It really makes my hair flat.</li>
    <li> Wife likes it.. price is abetter than other product she uses but is cheaper.</li>
    <li> I like it! It may just be my perception, but it seems like I can feel the added body while I&#x27;m shampooing. What is NOT just perception is a definite reduction in the hair I find on my bathroom counter after blow drying my hair. Thanks!</li>
    <li> not helping at all, hair is still getting thinner</li>
    <li> But overall it is a decent, sulfate-free shampoo for those with fine hair. The smell is nice and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Really thickens my hair as stated! Even my long-distance SO commented over Skype that he could see the difference, that&#x27;s kinda amazing!</li>
    <li> As an african who&#x27;s kept my hair natural for the last few years, finding the right shampoo has been a difficult journey. I&#x27;ve at least 4b type natural hair and it tangles when washed. Even when my hair was relaxed, it just locks up when it gets washed. I&#x27;ve come across 2 condtioners that do a good job detangling it and sometimes I just cowash but I really needed a shampoo as I do my hair most of the time. I tried a sample of carroll&#x27;s daughter shampoo and it didn&#x27;t tangle my hair but it costs 20buck or more. Plus, I&#x27;ve had tried other natural shampoos that&#x27;ve turned my hair into straw and others that make me shed like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled across this on amazon, ordered by accident and it does a wonderful job. My hair does not tangle, not even a bit. It&#x27;s amazing! My hair had been thinning and I feel this has thickened it. And it does not cost an arm and a leg. I use bedhead conditioner and it works well with this. I&#x27;ve had issues in the past where using a conditioner different from the shamooo caused tangling but this works well with bedhead and it&#x27;s also worked well with my deep conditioning masque. And, I don&#x27;t have hair falling out when I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new go -to shampoo and I was my hair way more now due to it. For what it costs, I think it&#x27;s worth a try. I read most of the reviews on here and it seems to work for most people regardless of race or hair type. It works better than all of the expensive shampoos I&#x27;ve used in the past. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I used one full bottle of this shampoo and conditioner (used another type of sulfate free L&#x27;Oréal s/c before).  My hairdresser was surprised that I had barely any split ends and it&#x27;s been 5 month since I had my last haircut.  I don&#x27;t know if my hair is getting ticker.  My husband thinks so.  I like this shampoo and the smell and just started a new bottle of each :)</li>
    <li> While I think this stuff lifts your roots to make your hair &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34;, I had a terrible allergic reaction to this stuff. It made my scalp so red and itchy, I had to use coal tar shampoo and hydrocortisone cream for a week. I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to a shampoo or conditioner like this before.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the result made my hair frizzy and gave me buildup on my scalp.</li>
    <li> it is an amazing shampoo.  i use both the shampoo an the conditioner. my hair fall has reduced and it appears thicker although i have thin hair.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use this shampoo, although I use other L&#x27;Oreal products this one &#x27;hurts&#x27;....when it gets into your eyes it STINGS, badly and a quick wipe or wash of your eyes doesn&#x27;t help right away.  When I shampoo my own hair in the shower, it is almost impossible to keep out of my eyes.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo that really works.  I use with the conditioner and it gives my hair great texture and volume.  Looks like I have more hair than I actually have.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a year now. It definitely helps my fine hair and smoothens out my cuticles.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo conditioner combo. Smells great</li>
    <li> the only shampoo that cleans very well and at the same time is very gentle to the scalp. and very friendly price tag. Wonderful product.  Edited 2.5 years later :) I still use only this shampoo because whenever i use something else (in hotels etc) it gives me dandruff.  And it makes my hair smell AMAZING until next wash!!! I wish this never discontinues, ever.</li>
    <li> Very nice light smell. Clean feeling</li>
    <li> Leaves hair and scalp not only clean but hair appears more full.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mom since she is getting older and her long, think hair is getting thinner.  She doesn&#x27;t notice much of a difference and the smell isn&#x27;t that great.  Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Does wonders to my hair AND is cruelty-free!</li>
    <li> Have used only couple of times, I can see that my hairfall has reduced and it leaves my hair nice and clean. i did not notice a big difference in thickness, but its difficult to say it in just two uses.will update after two months of use. so far it is good...</li>
    <li> Ive used two bootles. The first bottle seemed to actually make a difference but i am thinking it seeme thicker as my hair was shorter then. The second bottle im using seems to have made my hair really static all the time and makes it very very knotty and my hair gets greasy quicker. Wont be buying a third bottle however i think people with shorter hair should try this product with the serum and conditioner</li>
    <li> one of my go to hair products</li>
    <li> Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, aka SLS aka &amp;#34;Sulfates&amp;#34;  aka Sulfuric acid are bad for your skin, often causing small sores.  However, they do make a wonderful lather- which doesnt actually do anything but make you think it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thinning hair (or &amp;#34;It done thinned&amp;#34;) and I try not to use sulfate, so when I saw this I had to try it (this is my second purchase). This stuff makes my scalp all tingly and gets it nicely clean. It also seems to have a thickening effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what&#x27;s nice is the Wonderful fresh feeling I get after using this and the associated conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have tried this shampoo over and over.  After I use it, blow dry hair and then put a comb through it, my hair gets totally poofy.  It makes it totally uncontrollable.  I can&#x27;t do a thing with it.  I don&#x27;t know if it is because it makes the hair dry or I don&#x27;t know what it does the hair.  It&#x27;s ashame, because I like the smell.  Once in awhile I may use it and I don&#x27;t get that effect, but if I use it two days in a row, I cannot control my hair.  It is as if I have electricity running through my hair.</li>
    <li> I did read a lot of negative comments in here and I was skeptical. The price at Amazon for this product is much better I bought this shampoo for much more from a  duane reade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I always wait a lot longer when I use products before I review them. But I HAD to write a review for this shampoo. I am not sure if i can compare products with their names because some websites block the names because its not good to discuss competitive products. But I am going to mention many shampoos here because I found this one to be sooo good after trying zillion others. My hair is very wavy considerably thick. It did not need any help until the past several months. Things changed I moved and I started losing A LOT OF HAIR. A LOT. I panicked and got several products to help my hair thinning issue. I used pantene , herbal essences and all other drug store brands. I bought a salon product too that costed a fortune that promised thickening and nourishing. I still have thick hair but the thinning is on top part and temple actually. The problem with all other shampoos was that even though some of them plumped up hair they gave it so much root lift that my thinning hair in the front looked all the more thin with lot of scalp showing. Most of what I tried were sulfate  based shampoos so they did dry my hair a lot and i started losing more hair because of dryness.Some of them didn&#x27;t do anything at all to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found this one. I was HOOKED to this from my first use. This shampoo DOES thicken. Not only does it thicken it makes hair really really soft and manageable. I also got a good shine with this product. MY hair looks and feels gorgeous. It doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down. The root lift is the appropriate amount so my individual thinning hairs don&#x27;t stand up to show scalp and make the problem worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to continue to use this shampoo. I don&#x27;t use conditioners because they make my hair greasy and weigh it down. I also lose a lot of hair when I useconditioners. I use this shampoo along with some oils to condition hair before or after hair wash. If you have thinning hair and nothing else worked try this. This is a good product.</li>
    <li> Only shampoo my husband will use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using their Everstrong &#x27;Sulfate-free&#x27; shampoo for about 3 or 4 weeks and have grudually developed (very shortly after the start of using it) contact dermatitis on my face. Apparently there is something called &#x27;run-off&#x27; when it comes to contact dermatitis wherein if you use an offending product on your hair it can cause symptoms to develop in the surrounding areas; ears, face, mouth, neck and even chest. I haven&#x27;t incorporated ANY other product into my life other than this one prior to, or since, my symptoms developed. It may not be the cause, but this heavily perfume and chemical-ladened product is getting thrown out nonetheless. Not that that is a side issue since perfumes, especially those of the synthetic variety which almost all L&#x27;Oreal products contain, can definitely irritate the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I&#x27;ll just deal with dirty hair until I get to a store that offers cleaner products.</li>
    <li> absolutely visible volume</li>
    <li> First off, I did not purchase this item off of Amazon. I purchased it from the drugstore( Walmart, Target, Walgreens, Rite Aid or CVS). I have fine hair and although this is not a miracle cure for it. It does somehow provide my hair with a little bit more volume than most shampoos and it did give my hair the appearance that I did have thicker hair. I do use both the shampoo and conditioner together. It smells almost like the aromatherapy line Stress Relief from Bath and Body Works. It is not extremely moisturizing so once or twice a week I do a coconut oil mask on my hair. I will continue to purchase this item for as long as it continues to work on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Please use a clarifying shampoo at least once a week. This shampoo line can cause a little buildup. I still use it everyday but at least once a week I use a clarifying shampoo.</li>
    <li> This past year I decided to pay more attention to my hair and this product truly does make a difference. My hair is usually very dry and tough especially after taking a shower so I decided to try this product since L&#x27;Oreal makes terrific products. The first day I tried it I noticed that my hair became so silky and smooth after drying. I LOVE IT. Plus it&#x27;s cheap for one so it&#x27;s very cost efficient! (especially if you&#x27;re a poor college student like me.) This&#x27;ll probably last you a month or so. If you&#x27;re doubtful DON&#x27;T BE. you won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair and this makes my scalp feel and smell great.  I read that sulfates damage hair follicles so I tried this and it seems to do what it says.  I use it with the thickening lotion and it makes my hair feel and look healthier and thicker, considering how little hair I have.  Still looking for that miracle shampoo that helps hair stay healthy and promotes new growth.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT - QUALITY AND PRICE - WE BOUGHT AGAIN !  A +</li>
    <li> This stuff dried my scalp out.  It was worse than using dish detergent on my hair.  Maybe I am allergic to it, but I can&#x27;t recommend it because it was so drying.  My scalp was itching like crazy after the 3rd shampoo.  Check other reviews to see if it works for others, but I had to toss mine out.</li>
    <li> Works great and is sulfate free.  Make my hair feel great.</li>
    <li> Does what it claims to do, but then L&#x27;oreal products are always good.</li>
    <li> very disappointing compared to other sulfate-free shampoos....leaves my hair dirty feeling and won&#x27;t style qell at all.</li>
    <li> This is great for my hair. I have very oily hair (dark blonde) and this doesn&#x27;t make my hair look as oily probably because of the no-sulfate formula. I don&#x27;t really need my hair thickened (I have pretty long hair that I typically grow out and donate to locks of love), I just wanted sulfate free and I do not color my hair, or for that matter blow dry it at all, if that is what you are looking for. It also doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy. I had A LOT of trouble with natural shampoos from the Body Shop and Trader Joes. I would get knots and my hair would stick together no matter how many times a day I brushed. This doesn&#x27;t do that. I&#x27;ve also used normal shampoos like Suave and Blonde Pantene and those are okay, but about 2/3 of the way through my day, my hair looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed it. This is better.</li>
    <li> when you reach menopause time ladies, your hair starts to thin out and look a little frazzled. this shampoo calms the hair, adds body and volume and returns some of its natural shine.  highly recommend.  and I&#x27;ve tried quite a lot of shampoos; from expensive brands to drug store variety.  Can&#x27;t go wrong.  and for the price....added bonus.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this shampoo is almost making me want to cry. I must be allergic to an ingredient in it. I have bad scalp due to dermatitis though right now, it is worse than normal. My old shampoo no longer seemed to be helping so I picked up a bottle of this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huge mistake. My scalp is still burning hours after I used it. I strictly only use sulfate free products and used a different L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free products several years ago (the one in the orange bottle) without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scalp may just be too sensitive for the ingredients in this shampoo. I guess I&#x27;ll stick with enjoy and maple holistics.</li>
    <li> My husband started using this shampoo after I received a sample of it.  His hair had become very thin after a fight with an illness he had and this stuff  has almost completely restored his hair back to the way it was before he got sick.  It does have a medicine like smell but otherwise it is great!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product at all.  I&#x27;m not a fan of looking like bacon has been fried in my hair right after I wash it and dry it.  It made my hair greasy and limp.  To be fair, that could be because it&#x27;s sulfate free.  I&#x27;ve tried several sulfate free brands because my hair dye stays in longer with sulfate free shampoo, but I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s not worth having a greasy mop on my head all the time.  If you don&#x27;t have fine hair you may not have the same problem with the product.  I didn&#x27;t notice that it made my hair any thicker.  This product has been relegated to my &amp;#34;if greasy hair comes in style&amp;#34; product box under my sink.  I swear, if I could get back a nickel of every $ I spent on the products in that box, I&#x27;d be rich!</li>
    <li> This product smells AH-MAZING.  It makes my hair a little bit thicker but it definitely isn&#x27;t a miracle.  I like it and it cleans my hair.  So far it seems like the shampoo gives a lot of volume to my hair, without making my curls go limp or super frizzy.  The bottle is a good size and I would totally repurchase this.</li>
    <li> I have very fine thin hair compounded with an oily scalp so getting voluminous hair is a challenge. This shampoo has completely changed that. It cleanses without leaving the scalp stripped and really does provide volume. Since I first tried it I&#x27;v gone through 2 more  bottles and will probably buy more once I&#x27;m finished with the shampoo I&#x27;m currently using. The only drawback is the smell which is more a personal preference. I&#x27;m not a big fan of minty smells but I love it enough to overlook  a and keep using this shampoo</li>
    <li> I find this shampoo very good for brittle and weak hair.</li>
    <li> Sincerely, I cannot picture life without this stuff. Little about me, been battling an incurable disease. Was put on chemo and lost a lot of hair... I mean a lot! My hair was so thin and brittle. After haveing a very bad reaction, I was taken off chemo and all I wanted to do was reclaim my hair. I went for a day to be pampered at hair salon after they assured me chemo had no affect on treatments and the girl over processed what little hair I had left AND cut off about 4 inches. I was bawling my eyes out. Terrible!!! Anyway, I wanted to go chem free and cut out dead stuff and keep my hair virgin. I am about 4 inches away from all virgin hair and this stuff is to blame!!! My hair grew back so fast and it came in so healthy. I do not use anything with alcohol and I get a trim every month. To date, I can wash my hair with just the shampoo... conditioner is not even needed but I use anyway. It is a MUST buy!! Chemo and over processed/ burnt hair was no match for this stuff. It is the BEST!!!</li>
    <li> My hair was falling out and I started using this and it stopped. Something in most conditioners and shampoos bothers it but not this. I notice a big difference in how easy my hair is to manage with this product. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price point!</li>
    <li> I must admit it. I have fine, thin hair and try different products to vary my hair care. I bought this one with great expectations and wasn&#x27;t impressed with it. It didn&#x27;t do anything for my fine thin hair. I&#x27;ll stick with the others that work well: tresemme full and thick; pantene pro v, even the brand of this one in smoothing sulfate free worked better for me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, just another shampoo that didn&#x27;t work for me. I won&#x27;t be buying again.&lt;br /&gt;  I have very fine hair and am always on the lookout for another thickening shampoo to add to my regulars. Hence, this purchase. It&#x27;s advertised as a thickening shampoo and is 100% vegan. \\&quot;Fortifies thinning hair, purifies scalp, amino acid complex.\\&quot; I really liked another Loreal shampoo in a gold and brown tube because it was sulfate free and did wonders on my fine hair. This one turned out to be a big waste of time, effort and money. It doesn&#x27;t do the job it was made for. I&#x27;ve used it several times now to give it a fair chance with great disappointment. After just a few hours after using it, I find it leaves my hair limp and greasy and I can&#x27;t recommend it to others, even it if was given away: I would give away to someone else.&lt;br /&gt;  If you have fine and/or thinning hair, may I recommend Tresemme Healthy Volume for a traditional shampoo, or Avalon Organic Biotin B-Complex Therapy shampoo for those that prefer a natural/organic shampoo? Another recent find of mine I can recommend, though it isn&#x27;t quite as good as the other two, but better than most is Andalou Naturals Shampoo and conditioner for thinning hair. As with Avalon shampoos, it is cruelty free, gluten free, non GMO and certified organic. It uses fruit stem cell science as for building block. I prefer sulfate free shampoos, which is why I prefer Avalon&#x27;s line of organic shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, but this L&#x27;Oreal shampoo is one I can&#x27;t recommend under any circumstances. In my humble opinion, all it does is leave your hair greasy and limp. Of course, if that is the look you&#x27;re seeking, by all means this is the shampoo for you.e seeking, by all means this is the shampoo for you.</li>
    <li> Can feel the difference on my hair! The smell is nice too!</li>
    <li> This seems to work pretty well making my hair look just slightly thicker. However, since I started using it my scalp has been kind of itchy and has little pimple like bumps. I have very dry scalp, and use neutrogena shampoo for dandruff, which basically cured my itchy bumpy scalp. But since I started using this, the itchiness I thought I cured years ago has come back a bit! Hoping it&#x27;s a fluke becuase it&#x27;s supposed to be good for your scalp, and it does make my hair look nice.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have thinning hair by any stretch, just fine strands that can get quite flat. I missed Beauty Brands liter sale and got this when debating whether or not to hand over full price for my favorite salon brand. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll switch back!</li>
    <li> Lathers very well, you only need a small amount. Nice fresh smell. And I can tell a difference in the thickness and health of my hair.</li>
    <li> smells so good! and the smell stays all day</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t 100% say that it makes my hair thicker, but I believe it does.</li>
    <li> Great price! fast shipping. I will definitely buy again from seller Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying all the sulfate-free, paraben-free shampoos and skin products in the drugstores and came across L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s offerings. I bought this thickening formula and conditioner and have used it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has a strong, rosemary-ish smell which I didn&#x27;t mind. I tend not to like strong fragrances but, even though this one is a bit strong, it didn&#x27;t make me sneeze or otherwise bother me like some scents do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo cleans my hair and scalp thoroughly and creates a lot of lather, so you don&#x27;t need a lot. My scalp tends to have an oily buildup, and this shampoo cut through the buildup and the effect lasts all day. For thinning hair this is important. You want your hair follicles to be clean and unclogged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the thickening, I can&#x27;t say if it thickened my hair or not - I didn&#x27;t notice. I did notice that it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it look thinner. I would buy L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong Thickening shampoo again.</li>
    <li> Love all Loreal EverStrong. This works great.</li>
    <li> This review is for the whole Everstrong Thickening system (shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in hair tonic). First, I LOVE the smell. Some may not like it, but I prefer a fresh herbal, earthy scent over fruity ones and this one is the nicest scent i&#x27;ve experienced except for my favorite scent of Aveda&#x27;s Shampure. If you hate the scent, it&#x27;s not overwhelming and doesn&#x27;t linger too long (unless your hair has a tendency to hold scent and you use alot of the leave-in tonic).&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I like how this system performs for my thin/fine, wavy, breakage-prone hair. I don&#x27;t see where it helps with shedding, but I like that it provides my hair with some thickness and texture post shower. It&#x27;s not magical, so don&#x27;t expect to dry your hair and be left with a completely different head of hair if you have thin/super fine hair, but it does make it more manageable and leave it thicker as opposed to non-thickening systems. It cleans nicely and rinses out without leaving buildup. Can&#x27;t say whether the tonic really does anything other than calm the scalp, but I find the combination of the three combined with my other styling products gives me better results than using other shampoos/conditoners.</li>
    <li> Worked as expected!  Great product along with the Shampoo and Thickening Tonic!  Love the three together and recommend it to all who want their hair to be a bit thicker.</li>
</ol>
