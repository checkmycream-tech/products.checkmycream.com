      <li>YES CELLULITE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry brushing is a great way to not only buff away dead skin, but it&#x27;s fantastic at boosting circulation and lymphatic drainage, and ultimately ridding the body of toxins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW</li>
      <li>Your skin will be so soft and smooth, but once you release those toxins your skin actually has a better overall look to it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only owned one other bath brush, which is just a cheap brush with a plastic handle that has seen better days.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not made out of materials that&#x27;s not mold and mildew resistant, but it&#x27;s still great for helping to improve your circulation and getting rid of the dry skin and dead skin that you didn&#x27;t even know was there.  </li>

      <li>Dry brushing has been around for years, there are definitely huge benefits to doing it.</li>
      <li>The actual brush area is also larger than most brushes, allowing for the washing of a broader area.  </li>
      <li>Then I quickly noticed that the wooden handle was already detached.</li>
      <li>This one is far better designed and the first few times I&#x27;ve used it, brush hasn&#x27;t shown no sign of detaching.</li>
      <li>and I would definitely recommend purchasing if you are looking for a good brush to get your circulation going and get rid of those dead skin cells!</li>
      <li>brush is comfortable, easy to use, and takes up less room than my previous set of brushes did.  </li>
      <li>first happened to me after 2 weeks of daily use and repeated every shower thereafter.</li>
      <li>length and handle of this brush are such that i can reach more of the back than was possible with brushes used previously.&lt;br</li>
      <li>With a wooden handle and natural fibers you can get the job done much easier without the unpleasant sensation plus the head has a strap on the back where you can slide your hand under the strap and have more control over the brush head, consider as superior massage leverage while bathing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I consider back scrubbers to be somewhat generic and wouldn&#x27;t ordinarily spend a lot of time shopping for one, this one stands out as a good want to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>This brush revitalizes the skin with its soft and natural bristles.</li>
      <li>The bristles of the brush are 100% natural material</li>
      <li>wow.</li>
      <li>My suggestion is that you keep it well away from the shower/tub for drying as natural bristles can mold/mildew.  </li>
      <li>Because of the natural bristles, the brush takes a while to dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The full wood design and the strap for your hand make it a very versatile product for wet and dry use.</li>
      <li>for even more versatility, remove the detachable handle, and slide your hand through the strap on the back of the brush for wet or dry brushing.  </li>
      <li>It was rough enough to exfoliate dead skin cells and yet soft enough that it felt like I was getting a good back scratch.  </li>
      <li>It needs to really drip dry.  </li>
      <li>The brush has a nice quality curved wooden handle that is approximately 12 inches in length with a nice large (approximately 4 inch in diameter) round detachable brush head.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This bath brush by 1Easylife is versatile.&lt;br /&gt;It has natural bristles with massage nodules intermingled among the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;Even when wet, the natural bristles remain somewhat firm...which is what I prefer. I don&#x27;t like it when the bristles  collapse when wet. If the bristles are too firm for you, soften them in warm water for 30-60 minutes before use.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very comfortable brush to use.&lt;br /&gt;The curved handle works perfectly for me. I was able to reach all parts of my back.  Because of the natural bristles, the brush takes a while to dry.&lt;br /&gt;I like this brush a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is detachable (it slides off) making the brush easier to use for cellulite. Slide your hand through the strap on the back of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product&#x27;s description is very thorough. It covers all the features of this versatile, multifunction brush so I&#x27;ll give you the measurements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Measurements (approximate):&lt;br /&gt;16 1/2\\&quot; from end of handle to end of brush&lt;br /&gt;4 1/4\\&quot; diameter of brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this brush for dry massage. Do an internet search to learn the benefits &amp; technique of dry brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush can also be used to help remove cellulite. An internet search will provide information &amp; YouTube videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for even more versatility, remove the detachable handle, and slide your hand through the strap on the back of the brush for wet or dry brushing.  Review sample provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hang to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best shower brush I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% Satisfaction Warranty</li>
    <li> I like that you have remove the brush from the handle. The handle is not as stable when you want to use it in hard to reach areas like the back.  Overall a good product and price. The handle is good quality.</li>
    <li> When I first received this brush I thought it was going to be too rough for my skin, but after applying my body wash it actually felt good using it on my skin.  It was rough enough to exfoliate dead skin cells and yet soft enough that it felt like I was getting a good back scratch.  I really thought it did exactly as it promised.  It is very well-made and sturdy.  The handle is long enough to reach those hard to get places, and curved so those places are easier to get to.  The head of the brush is also detachable, so you can take it off if you want.  I liked the brush and I would definitely recommend purchasing if you are looking for a good brush to get your circulation going and get rid of those dead skin cells!</li>
    <li> I had a brush like this for 10years (different brand). But it recently fell apart. My wife found this one and gave it to me for my birthday. Feels and looks just like the old one I had. It has great reach and the white rubber bumps are perfect with the bristles.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Easylife bath brush to replace a damaged one with a straight handle.  I had assumed that I would replace the old one with something very similar, but was delighted to see that this one, with a curved handle, was available.  The slight curve of the handle makes it easier to reach the bather&#x27;s back and holding the brush is easier thanks to slight grooves for fingers at the end of the brush.  The actual brush area is also larger than most brushes, allowing for the washing of a broader area.  Would definitely recommend this brush for the reasons mentioned above, as well as for the fact that its price is competitive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only owned one other bath brush, which is just a cheap brush with a plastic handle that has seen better days. I never thought about replacing it until I received a complimentary EasyLife Detachable Curved Long-Handled Bath Brush in exchange for my honest thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I thought the brush was broken when it arrived in the mail. Then I quickly noticed that the wooden handle was already detached. The handle easily slips in the groove that is located on the back of the brush head. The brush head itself seems to be made pretty good. It can be slipped off the wooden handle, so you can use it like a scrub brush by putting your hand in the cloth handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m impressed by the EasyLife Detachable Curved Long-Handled Bath Brush and I recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This 1Easylife Detachable Curved long-handled wooden body brush is especially made to get dead skin cells out of your skin, stimulate circulation, eliminate toxins, reduce ingrown hairs and the appearance of cellulite and leaves your skin glowing, smooth and looking radiant. The design of the body and shower brush is ergonomically designed to provide you with a spa quality detox with fine bristles that will not scratch your skin. This toxin-free brush is also good for Dry Body Brushing. With a wooden handle and natural fibers you can get the job done much easier without the unpleasant sensation plus the head has a strap on the back where you can slide your hand under the strap and have more control over the brush head, consider as superior massage leverage while bathing. The long curved handle is effective and ideal to reach your back, feet and those hard to reach areas without having a lot of mobility. The full wood design and the strap for your hand make it a very versatile product for wet and dry use. Using the long-handled brush can unclog your pores, exifoliate the skin by leaving it look brighter and feeling softer and smooth. It stimulates the lymphatic system helping to speed up the process of eliminating metabolic waste from the body. It increases blood circulation to the skin, which helps release toxins from within as well. Regular brushing of your skin increases your circulation, stimulates elimination of cellulite and soften and smooth your skin surface. It can also improve a sluggish immune system and poor digestion when carried out daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  To use you begin with small circles at your feet and work up to your neck, always brushing in the same direction ( meaning if you are going clockwise, keep your circles going clockwise). The only exception to this rule is using it on your back, you use the brush and brush downwards from your neck towards your lower back. Once you are done with your back you need to shower to wash away all of the impurities you have released by this process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I highly recommend this brush, it is amazing. This brush will leave you feeling and looking great. Your skin will be so soft and smooth, but once you release those toxins your skin actually has a better overall look to it. The bristles of the brush are 100% natural material so you will need to find someplace for your brush to dry where it won&#x27;t be somewhere humid, or dark like your shower. Otherwise your will find mold spores on your brush, if you&#x27;re not careful. This brush has these plastic nubs that really feel wonderful when brush it across your back in those circles, and if you have any sore spots it will help to relieve them as well.

    <li> Easy to use and works well.</li>
    <li> The bath brush I initially received appeared to be defective.  The plastic brush head was not straight on the round wooden end of the handle and the little nails were coming unattached from the area it was nailed to.  In addition, a number of the bristles were falling out.  I contacted the company and I was sent a replacement.  The replacement appeared to be in better condition in terms of how it was put together.  The brush has a nice quality curved wooden handle that is approximately 12 inches in length with a nice large (approximately 4 inch in diameter) round detachable brush head.  I would prefer the handle to not be detachable as I have found that using for a while, the brush head will sometimes fall off.  With that being said though this does have a strap that is included on the brush head so that is can be used as a hand scrubber.  The brush head has a combination of bristles and rubber knobs that both exfoliate and massage the skin.  The bristles are firm but not harsh on the skin and works well but I did find several bristles came out on initial use.  I am not sure if it is because it is new but I have other brushes that did not lose bristles on initial use.  I will update my review if I have any further issues with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about using this the first time because of the density of the bristles, but after using it I know that that was ridiculous.  I really like that this brush can be used wet or dry, and because the bristles are made of natural materials, I am comfortable using this on my body. I didn&#x27;t know what Grass Tea was and how grass was used to make bristles, but if you google it, you will totally understand.  I do recommend that you do NOT hang this in your shower after you are done using it. It&#x27;s not made out of materials that&#x27;s not mold and mildew resistant, but it&#x27;s still great for helping to improve your circulation and getting rid of the dry skin and dead skin that you didn&#x27;t even know was there.  I scrubbed my legs while the brush was dry and holy wow. When I took a shower after and shaved my legs I felt so smooth and baby soft!!! Afterwards I learned that in scrubbing my legs dry that my skin will GLOW.  I would recommend this to people who have a problem with cellulite and or aging skin. This is perfect for stimulating your blood flow and will increase your circulation.  I recieved this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Very rough. Only good for legs and feet.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I like to use a long-handled brush for washing our backs.  I have also used a hand brush for exfoliating areas like my elbows.  This is the first brush that I have tried to can do both jobs.  The brush is natural bristles with massaging nubs built in - it washes and massages at the same time.  It has a curved long handle with a tie included that allows you to hand the brush up when it is not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is fantastic about this brush is that the handle can be slipped off and it becomes a hand brush that has a built in grip strap.  I can now use use the one brush instead of two.  That makes it easier for me to find space in the bathroom to hang dry the brush.  My suggestion is that you keep it well away from the shower/tub for drying as natural bristles can mold/mildew.  It needs to really drip dry.  I have mounted a command hook on the outside of our shower stall where I hang the brush when it is not in use.  What I like about the command hook is that you don&#x27;t have to put a hole in the wall (especially important if you are renting.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is comfortable, easy to use, and takes up less room than my previous set of brushes did.  I recommend it for anyone who likes to use a bath brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discounted price on this product for test and review purposes.</li>
    <li> Great brush, love the curved handle.</li>
    <li> One annoying thing I&#x27;ve found about my old bath brush is that the brush would detach from the handle at unanticipated times. This one is far better designed and the first few times I&#x27;ve used it, brush hasn&#x27;t shown no sign of detaching. Yet, it is detachable if that&#x27;s actually what you intention is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that concern addressed, it&#x27;s definitely replacing my old one. Other than that, I have fancy words to describe how it feels or what kind of job it does. I just soap it up with my liquid soap and I find the bristles are easy on the skin and, it gives you a nice \\&quot;back scratch\\&quot; in addition to just keep that area clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I consider back scrubbers to be somewhat generic and wouldn&#x27;t ordinarily spend a lot of time shopping for one, this one stands out as a good want to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got this at a discount. Doesn&#x27;t matter though. When I write reviews, I always remind myself that I read reviews to help me make better buying decisions. So I&#x27;m committed to helping you in the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;∞ PositiveLogic</li>

    <li> This is a back scratcher as well as a back brush.  I don&#x27;t think the bristles do as much as with a bristles-only back brush because the knobs keep the bristles from digging in, but it is a good combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use the brush dry if all you want is a back scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length and handle of this brush are such that i can reach more of the back than was possible with brushes used previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush can be removed from the handle and used separately, for example, to scrub the back of someone in the bathtub.  That&#x27;s a plus.  The minus is that the brush can fall off the handle when you are scrubbing your back in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This first happened to me after 2 weeks of daily use and repeated every shower thereafter. I was aggravated to the point of planning to glue the 2 together, but then I discovered if whenever the brush falls off I put the brush on the handle, hold the handle in my hand and pound the edge of the brush straight down against the shower floor that the handle locks into place and gives a few days of showers without falling off.  I still expect to have to glue the brush to the handle some day, but for now an occasional pound works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line, however, is that I would not go back to the brushes of the type used previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> The 1Easylife Detachable Curved Long-handled Bristles Detox Wooden Body Bath and Shower Skin Brush  is excellent, the bristles are firm but not too rough.  Dry brushing has been around for years, there are definitely huge benefits to doing it. It increases blood flow, exfoliates the skin, clears pores and helps get rid of cellulite times- YES CELLULITE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry brushing is a great way to not only buff away dead skin, but it&#x27;s fantastic at boosting circulation and lymphatic drainage, and ultimately ridding the body of toxins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW TO DRY BRUSH:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Keep the brush dry, and brush one or two times a day.&lt;br /&gt;-Brush towards the heart in long strokes, circular sweeps counter clock-wise&lt;br /&gt;-Avoid back and forth motions&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t brush too hard</li>
    <li> the first one that i opened fell on the floor and the brush can me off. so i epoxied it on and put a screw in the handle to keep it on. i also rebuilt the remaining brushes. i lived in china for 3 years and know they do quality work if you give them exact specifications and moniter them, after all left alone any one will take the easy way.</li>
