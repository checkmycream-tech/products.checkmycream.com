      <li>This is a very good basic mascara.  </li>
      <li>and I love that it adds so much volume!!</li>
      <li>but it is cheap.</li>

      <li>Couple of coats and you have the perfect thick coon look.</li>

      <li>I have tried so many different brands of mascara and ALWAYS return to this one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s always so frustrating when cosmetic companies discontinue good products!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve made the mistake of buying the waterproof, and YES it&#x27;s VERY waterproof--have to use cleansing cream to get it off.  </li>
      <li>And I mean that in a good way.</li>
      <li>I wear it every day and have been using this particular mascara for 12 years.</li>
      <li>But I always come back to this kind and wonder why I ever tried other kinds.</li>
      <li>Nice and thick formula.</li>
      <li>makes my lashes look long and full, truly lush.</li>
      <li>This is cheap enough that I just carry an extra tube in my purse.</li>
      <li>Looks like an old product!</li>
      <li>The brush and the color were nice, but it is just too messy for everyday use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only expienced something like this before when the product was too old.</li>
      <li>I have spent so much money on mascara; from department stores to drug stores.</li>
      <li>It is my go to mascara, and two coats make it just that much more dramatic</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this mascara, and I find it to be a little too liquid-y for my taste.  </li>
      <li>This is a decent product but not exactly what I was looking for; It made my eyelashes thicker not longer.</li>

    <li> Best mascara on the planet</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. But...its very hard to come off. Seriously read some of the other reviews this product takes days to come off. Like wtf do they have in this little tub? Good product. Yes it does make my lashes longer. But i dont want to go to hassle of trying all my might to get this off lashes.</li>
    <li> always the one I come back to . Have been using for years and it truly works. Try the new ones that come out, but this is still the best. makes my lashes look long and full, truly lush. Will keep using</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, mostly because its no-nonsense.. It gets the job done nicely and is easy to wash off with water at the end of the day.. And if it starts to clump up.. A couple saline eyedrops will fix it up!</li>
    <li> I have bought this mascara before at the drug store and loved it, but this one seemed old it was very clumpy and had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this mascara, and I find it to be a little too liquid-y for my taste.  It seems to dry slowly and end up around my eyelashes instead of on my eyelashes.  The brush and the color were nice, but it is just too messy for everyday use.</li>
    <li> love this mascara gives me volume</li>
    <li> I have spent so much money on mascara; from department stores to drug stores. This is by far the best mascara on the market. It volumizes and lengthens, and it stays on all day. I wear it every day and have been using this particular mascara for 12 years. It is affordable enough to buy and try, I assure you you will never buy another mascara again. You will love it.</li>
    <li> Makes beautiful lashes, but by the end of the evening, half of it&#x27;s on my face, around my eyes.  NOT good.</li>
    <li> Best formula for mascara. The brush isn&#x27;t so great, but it&#x27;s workable. I just haven&#x27;t found a mascara that has this good of a formula that&#x27;s from drugstore. If they improve the brush it would be perfect for me</li>
    <li> This is the only kind of mascara I buy.  I have tried others throughout the years but keep coming back to this one!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok mascara, but it doesn&#x27;t wash off easily.</li>

    <li> This is a pretty good mascara. I feel like it takes me a few uses to really get it working. In the beginning, it&#x27;s a tad clumpy. However, for the price point, it&#x27;s my favorite mascara. My lashes look long and dark (although not terribly full. What can you do.).</li>
    <li> very good ink. The wife happy, the mistress is happy, girlfriends very much love me. I like to give gifts to women. This ink attracted many women.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and have been using this brand for many years.</li>

Amazon&#x27;s price is right, I&#x27;m now checking w/Amazon b/4 I go out to shop as most of their items are cheaper than in stores.  The original does plump &amp; extend lashes to my satisfaction.</li>
    <li> It is thick and clumpy when taking the wand out of the tube. You even have to wipe off the clumps before applying. Then while you are wearing it, it smudges. Not worth buying again.</li>
    <li> Not very voluminous. Going back to Double Extend.</li>
    <li> This is been my favorite mascara for years.  PLEASE Loreal don&#x27;t ever discontinue or mess with the formula.  It&#x27;s always so frustrating when cosmetic companies discontinue good products!</li>

    <li> this mascara is great. it makes the eyes pop and I love that it adds so much volume!! although at times it can clump lashes together and sometimes smudges easily right after application.</li>
