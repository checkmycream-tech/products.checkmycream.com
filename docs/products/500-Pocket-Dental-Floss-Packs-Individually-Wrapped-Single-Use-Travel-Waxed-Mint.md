      <li>Or how many times did you notice broccoli</li>
      <li>And I know how many there are instead of running out of a roll of floss when traveling.</li>

      <li>Great buy - highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Enjoy have fun smile enjoy happy teeth.</li>
      <li>The floss breaks easily.</li>

      <li>Not even as strong as cheap generics.</li>
      <li>yes, this has a risk of removing a crown if you don&#x27;t know how to floss your teeth, but the nice thing is how much gunk this takes out of your teet in comparison.  </li>

      <li>I love the pocket dental floss because they are packaged flat like Band-Aids and remain sanitary.</li>
      <li>Tossing the used floss is much easier that way.</li>
      <li>I floss frequently, and pretty much after eating anything.</li>
      <li>so I prefer the Crest Glide ones better (less chance of them breaking).</li>
      <li>You tear the envelope in the middle and the floss is lightly attached to each half.</li>
      <li>500 individual wrapped thick mint flosses, love it.  </li>
      <li>For the price, they are also economical because if you bought regular dental floss in a plastic container the price would be more expensive (if you compare the actual length of dental floss).</li>
      <li>The paper packaging is a bit bigger than I expected, but otherwise this product is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>No flimsy like Ready Floss, this is a little thicker.</li>

    <li> I have been looking for something like this to put in my purse. How many times have you been at the movies with popcorn stuck in your teeth? Or how many times did you notice broccoli I your teeth in the restaurant bathroom mirror? Just throw several of these in all your purses, backpacks, travel kits. Place them in guest bathrooms and bedrooms.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent value! Super happy to find this deal!</li>
    <li> Yes, I said amazing. 500 for only $5.99! I wonder if they are trying to get rid of inventory? I travel for work, and having floss in this form is indispensable. The way these ares packaged make them super ideal for travel.</li>
    <li> Excellent to keep in your desk or handbag.  Keep them in your suitcase for those who travel regularly.  Great idea, great price.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for! I floss frequently, and pretty much after eating anything. So having these pocket flosses in my wallet is a big relief.</li>

    <li> The paper packaging is a bit bigger than I expected, but otherwise this product is exactly what I was looking for.  Easy to keep in my purse for after the movie!</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected or what I wanted. My fault or theirs?</li>

    <li> Nice to have individual packs,  easy to carry.  Does a good job.  Always good to have extra on hand for company.</li>
    <li> 500 individual wrapped thick mint flosses, love it.  I have to admit I floss 3 times a week at best, so this is at least 2 year supply.

    <li> Handy in a purse or desk, with an unexpected bonus. You tear the envelope in the middle and the floss is lightly attached to each half. Tossing the used floss is much easier that way. It doesn&#x27;t slither and float away. Or do only I have that problem?!</li>
    <li> Great for travel, or for tucking a couple in my purse.  And I know how many there are instead of running out of a roll of floss when traveling.</li>

    <li> Great for give-a-ways.</li>
    <li> My husband likes to keep a few of these in his wallet to use after lunch. He says they work fine for him. My teeth are closer together so I prefer the Crest Glide ones better (less chance of them breaking). I have used these and they work fine just not my first choice.</li>
    <li> these are great to have around the house or your place of work, they will fit in your wallet and they are already sold out apparently. made in colombia!</li>
    <li> I can just stick one of these in my pocket when going to a restaurant and floss my teeth in the bathroom after I am done eating.  Quick and easy to open, unravel, use ... then just throw away.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Just what we expected.</li>
    <li> Best deal out there. No flimsy like Ready Floss, this is a little thicker. For those with closely spaced teeth - this floss gets the gunk out</li>
    <li> This is a great concept and easy to carry.  While there are many positive things about this product - the thing I did not like was the thickness of the floss.</li>
    <li> The weight and the portability of these floss packs are perfect for carrying around with you in your pocket or purse.</li>
