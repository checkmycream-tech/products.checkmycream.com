      <li>How can I get more?</li>
      <li>This is the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it, and so I am still looking for the perfect eyebrow pencil for me.</li>
      <li>It sharpened perfectly without crumbling, and the pencil seems to be lasting forever.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I bought two more.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more than that, huh?</li>
      <li>,it looks so naturall, love the color .</li>
      <li>and I am really in love with this eyebrow pencil.</li>

      <li>I like the color, and the pencil goes on easily.  </li>

      <li>I found it too waxy for an eyebrow pencil, but it&#x27;s pretty nice as an eyeliner.</li>
      <li>Goes on easily and smoothly.  </li>
      <li>it is so light, it DOES work for me when I layer it with a darker color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Have been searching for a light gray since Maybelline discontinued theirs.  </li>
      <li>No other color pencil looked good with three colors except this one.  </li>
      <li>I think there&#x27;s nothing so special w/</li>
      <li>Seems like with a bit of practice, I am able to duplicate the original color of my eyebrows with this particular Sorme pencil.  </li>
      <li>It also came to me quickly.</li>
      <li>but still you can enjoy.. ;)</li>
      <li>It lasts all day, it&#x27;s the perfect shade for black hair, and it blends in very naturally.</li>
      <li>than anything, I find this pencil easy to use and very long-lasting.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for for over three years!  </li>
      <li>hard to find but very good to use.</li>
      <li>I was under the impression from the reviews that I would be able to stroke lines that looke like natural brow hairs.  </li>
      <li>I have been searching for an eyebrow pencil for YEARS, that would be the right color, and the right texture.  </li>
      <li>It sharpens up easily and goes on well, making eyebrows look very natural.</li>
      <li>This is the best eyebrow pencil that I have ever used because it creates a subtle line and the brush makes the lines very natural looking.</li>
      <li>and it is exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>this is exactly the color I was looking for.</li>
      <li>but it actually softens the color even more</li>
      <li>I had searched for quite a while for a gray eyebrow pencil that could be put on to achieve a light, soft gray.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but you don&#x27;t really get enough for your money in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>Hard to find Soft Gray eyebrow pencil, since Revlon and others have stopped selling probably the most popular color with baby boomers in the stores.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t get this kind of quality any less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This pencil is a nice soft grey.  </li>
      <li>My brows are going grey and light brown doesn&#x27;t look right with my skin.  </li>
      <li>It also stays on very well.  </li>
      <li>They were much too severe.  </li>
      <li>Additionally, I find this pencil to be very long-lasting &amp; smudge-proof once applied</li>
      <li>this product, I still like the one I bought in L&#x27;Oreal when it comes to Eyebrow not too much</li>
      <li>This should work very well with my silver hair.</li>
      <li>My husband says it makes my blue eyes look more blue and pretty.  </li>
      <li>a gray eyebrow pencil is a much better color than any of the other browns that I used to use.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;In general, I love this pencil and will likely re-buy Sorme for some time to come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is ok, but the color is too dark for me.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>One day I wore the last of my Maybelline on one eyebrow and the  Sorme on the other and when blended with my own eyebrow hairs, you had to look closely to tell them apart.  </li>
      <li>Cosmetic companies do not realize the need for real soft gray products for us aging boomer women.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After an exhaustive online search, I decided to try the Sorme Waterproof Eyebrow Pencil in Soft Rich Brown and Soft Gray to pencil in and/or highlight whatever is left of my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>Having the brush right there gives it a big plus.</li>
      <li>it was good to finally find this hard to find color that us seniors need..  </li>
      <li>Although I haven&#x27;t actually used this product yet, it looks like exactly how it&#x27;s described.</li>
      <li>The price for all the other Twin Pak colors is ok, BUT,the price for the Charcol Grey is outrages!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After I use it, I put on clear mascara or clear eyebrow gel made for the purpose of helping the color to stay put.  </li>
      <li>I have searched and searched for a soft gray brow pencil.</li>
      <li>I have been looking to no avail for an eyebrow pencil in soft gray.  </li>
      <li>Using the soft-gray pencil to add various color to my penciled in eyebrows really makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I took a chance and ordered this Sorme Waterproof Soft Gray Eyebrow Pencil.  </li>
      <li>extremely fast shipping, and at a very low shipping price.</li>
      <li>And every time I would purchase anything that said it was grey --- it would be way to dark, more like charcoal.  </li>
      <li>It is just the right color, and being a harder pencil, instead of a powder, you can draw the lines</li>
      <li>I had previously used the Maybelline Charcoal Grey Eyebrow Pencil, however it is no longer available</li>
      <li>The color is not exactly the same as the Maybelline&#x27;s gray, but it&#x27;s very close!  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier to have finally found a decent shade of grey.</li>
      <li>Ordered this and it is really way too dark.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used eyebrow pencils in the past and in my opinion, this pencil is really worth</li>
      <li>-- it&#x27;s not black and it&#x27;s not brown, it falls into the grey scale.</li>
      <li>if it is not applied to heavily, it creates a very natural look....and the pencil is hard enough that it goes on with a light touch.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have quite as much taupe and is a little truer gray.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is exactly the color I was looking for. the pencil is soft enough to go on smoothlt but hard enough to not clump. excellent.</li>
    <li> It took three people to get the plastic off the pencil so it could be used, which is a BIG deterrent to buying it again here on amazon, but I do like the product.  The grey color is soft enough for my white hair, and it lasts all day long. And the brush is stiff enough to spread the color around the brow to soften it. So I might try and find it in a local store and have them take care of the packaging issue.  I understand the whole &amp;#34;protecting the consumer&amp;#34; issue, but it was ridiculously difficult to open.  If it had not been for the packaging, I would be giving this product a 5 star review.</li>
    <li> Although I haven&#x27;t actually used this product yet, it looks like exactly how it&#x27;s described. This should work very well with my silver hair.</li>
    <li> color is natural looking, especially good with my graying hair. having the brush at hand it so convenient!</li>
    <li> Have tried to get a grey pencil to highlight my grey hair and blue eyes.  This pencil is a nice soft grey.  My hair is silver, white and grey.  No other color pencil looked good with three colors except this one.  My husband says it makes my blue eyes look more blue and pretty.  Can&#x27;t ask for more than that, huh?</li>
    <li> I had previously used the Maybelline Charcoal Grey Eyebrow Pencil, however it is no longer available so I took a chance and ordered this Sorme Waterproof Soft Gray Eyebrow Pencil.  The color is not exactly the same as the Maybelline&#x27;s gray, but it&#x27;s very close!  It doesn&#x27;t have quite as much taupe and is a little truer gray.  One day I wore the last of my Maybelline on one eyebrow and the  Sorme on the other and when blended with my own eyebrow hairs, you had to look closely to tell them apart.  I have a lot of silver streaking in my hair, and a gray eyebrow pencil is a much better color than any of the other browns that I used to use.  This pencil is a good consistency and goes on well and stays on well.  I will buy this again!  Hope this helps make your decision easier.</li>
    <li> hard to find but very good to use.</li>
    <li> This is by far the worst eyebrow pencil I have ever tried to use.  It was not dark enough or too dark depending on your point of view and I threw it away.</li>
    <li> It was easy to apply and the color is perfect.  the color lasts all day and living in Arizona with triple digit weather it is good to have something I won&#x27;t &amp;#34;sweat&amp;#34; away.</li>
    <li> The shade of gray was satisfactory.  Needed to show shade or describe the shade of gray in the offer of the product.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyebrow pencil that I have ever used because it creates a subtle line and the brush makes the lines very natural looking. Although I am blond, I like the gray color...if it is not applied to heavily, it creates a very natural look....and the pencil is hard enough that it goes on with a light touch.</li>
    <li> Have been searching for a light gray since Maybelline discontinued theirs.  This is darker than I really want but all around it is good.  Goes on easily and smoothly.  Having the brush right there gives it a big plus.</li>
    <li> Hard to find Soft Gray eyebrow pencil, since Revlon and others have stopped selling probably the most popular color with baby boomers in the stores. Very good eyebrow pencil.</li>
    <li> it was good to finally find this hard to find color that us seniors need..  How can I get more?</li>
    <li> I have gray hair and this color is just correct, not to dark and not a brown.  To cold to swim so not know about the waterproof.</li>
    <li> I had a charcoal eyebrow pencil from Mary Kay many years ago that was perfect with my then grayling hair. My hair is white now and I am unable to find anything that is really soft. I was disappointed that your soft gray was so dark.</li>
    <li> I use this pencil all the time.  The color is why I bought it and it is exactly what I wanted -- it&#x27;s not black and it&#x27;s not brown, it falls into the grey scale.</li>
    <li> When you have &amp;#34;salt and pepper&amp;#34; hair it is almost impossible to find an eyebrow pencil that works....this one is perfect!  Not a hint of the brown, taupe shade which does not work and NOT black which is too dark....I did not expect to use the brush on the end of the cap but it actually softens the color even more and I am really in love with this eyebrow pencil.</li>
    <li> I think there&#x27;s nothing so special w/ this product, I still like the one I bought in L&#x27;Oreal when it comes to Eyebrow not too much but still you can enjoy.. ;)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it because it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; gray enough for me.  I&#x27;m sure it would be good for someone whose hair isn&#x27;t quite as silver as mine.  The texture is good.</li>
    <li> I was recently diagnosed with Breast Cancer and have been undergoing chemotherapy since November 2013. Unfortunately, like so many other women, my eyelashes are nearly 100% gone and my eyebrows have thinned by at least 50%-75%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an exhaustive online search, I decided to try the Sorme Waterproof Eyebrow Pencil in Soft Rich Brown and Soft Gray to pencil in and/or highlight whatever is left of my eyebrows. I&#x27;ve used eyebrow pencils in the past and in my opinion, this pencil is really worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than anything, I find this pencil easy to use and very long-lasting. It sharpens up easily and goes on well, making eyebrows look very natural. Additionally, I find this pencil to be very long-lasting &amp; smudge-proof once applied and unlike others have cited, I do not find that the pencil rubs off easily. I especially love the Soft Rich Brown color, which intensifies when re-applied or layered. Seems like with a bit of practice, I am able to duplicate the original color of my eyebrows with this particular Sorme pencil.  Using the soft-gray pencil to add various color to my penciled in eyebrows really makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I cannot imagine using the Sorme soft-gray pencil on its own &#x27;cause it is so light, it DOES work for me when I layer it with a darker color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, I love this pencil and will likely re-buy Sorme for some time to come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comment Comment | Permalink</li>
    <li> I have been searching for an eyebrow pencil for YEARS, that would be the right color, and the right texture.  I have been to every local drug store and beauty supply store, with no success.&lt;br /&gt;I am SOO pleased with this pencil! My hair is silver, but I needed a brow color that was a couple shades darker, yet in the same spectrum. This shade of gray is perfect. The pencil is hard and firm enough to give strokes that look like brow hair, and it DOES NOT SMUDGE! It sharpened perfectly without crumbling, and the pencil seems to be lasting forever.&lt;br /&gt;The brush along with it is a nice helpful touch; also doesn&#x27;t smudge the pencil markings.  I am very pleased; you get what you pay for. You can&#x27;t get this kind of quality any less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I will order again.&lt;br /&gt;oh... extremely fast shipping, and at a very low shipping price.</li>
    <li> the product sucks, there&#x27;s no color...&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was fast, my rating does not have anything to do with the buyer, it&#x27;s the actual product that is worthless.</li>
    <li> I have searched and searched for a soft gray brow pencil. Ordered this and it is really way too dark. Cosmetic companies do not realize the need for real soft gray products for us aging boomer women.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression from the reviews that I would be able to stroke lines that looke like natural brow hairs.  The point was too thick and flat, and it did smudge, even on clean brows without any other cream, or makeup on. It was nowhere near waterproof, just a more expensive form of any other eyebrow pencil.</li>
    <li> I was very happy when I found this product. I am letting my hair go gray and was having a tough time finding gray eyebrow pencil as the large cosmetic are evidently no longer offering grays and reds. I saw this product on Amazon and bought one to see if it met my needs. I liked it so I bought two more. Good color and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love the brow pencil.  My brows are going grey and light brown doesn&#x27;t look right with my skin.  Grey is impossible to find.</li>
    <li> I have been looking to no avail for an eyebrow pencil in soft gray.  All I could find were black.  They were much too severe.  This was a find!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have always used the Maybellene Charcol Grey Eyebrow pencil, but can not find it in ANY STORE ANYMORE.  After searching on the Internet, I  found it on Amazon.  The price for all the other Twin Pak colors is ok, BUT,the price for the Charcol Grey is outrages!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when I saw the Water proof for a lower price  I tried it.&lt;br /&gt; It is ok, but the color is too dark for me.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a gray and finally found one ,l like it ,it looks so naturall, love the color .</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for for over three years!  I always used black or dark brown when I was young, because I had very dark hair.  My hair is now VERY grey, however, and continuing to use the dark color pencils made me look like Joan Crawford!!  And every time I would purchase anything that said it was grey --- it would be way to dark, more like charcoal.  This pencil is perfect.  It is just the right color, and being a harder pencil, instead of a powder, you can draw the lines it so they look like actual hair.  It also stays on very well.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it&#x27;s hard to find a charcoal color.  It&#x27;s okay, but you don&#x27;t really get enough for your money in my opinion.  The color is nice and it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I had searched for quite a while for a gray eyebrow pencil that could be put on to achieve a light, soft gray.  This one does that.  After I use it, I put on clear mascara or clear eyebrow gel made for the purpose of helping the color to stay put.  I like the color, and the pencil goes on easily.  It&#x27;s easy to control.  The only problem I have is that it still manages to disappear over the course of a day.  Since I know that will happen, I now take the pencil with me and retouch it once or twice during the day.  This is the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it, and so I am still looking for the perfect eyebrow pencil for me.</li>
    <li> If you are salt and pepper grey this is the color to use.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier to have finally found a decent shade of grey.</li>
    <li> The color is good, but the pencil doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly at all. You have to keep going over it, which makes the eyebrows appear too drawn on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s still way too dark. I need a lighter gray.</li>
    <li> I have black eyebrows and finding an eyebrow pencil that fills them without making them too dramatic is hard but this eyebrow pencil is AMAZING! It lasts all day, it&#x27;s the perfect shade for black hair, and it blends in very naturally. It also came to me quickly. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I found it too waxy for an eyebrow pencil, but it&#x27;s pretty nice as an eyeliner. It&#x27;s not completely waterproof for me, but it&#x27;s at least very water resistant. I think I&#x27;ll be putting an eyeshadow over it to set it.</li>
