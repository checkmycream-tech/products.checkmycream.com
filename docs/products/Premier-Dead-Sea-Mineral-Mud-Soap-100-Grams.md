      <li>but that&#x27;s hardly worth mentioning.</li>
      <li>The grit of the salt is also pretty fine, so if you are looking for a real exfoliation experience I would go with AHAVA or another brand as this will not get the job done for</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, right now I&#x27;m torn between a 3-star review and a 4-star.  </li>
      <li>It worked really well to clean my face and tighten my pours, without tightening my wallet for just one bar.  </li>
      <li>Is it good enough to pay more than your typical moisturizing, nice scented, women&#x27;s soap at your local store?</li>
      <li>I first bought the soap in a mall in North Carolina.  </li>
      <li>thanx ;)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since 2008 when I was aggressively sold one by a pretty lady.</li>
      <li>It creates a large amount of \\&quot;soapy suds\\&quot; so you can see exactly where on your body you&#x27;ve gotten, instead of just guessing.</li>
      <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefit to this soap is that it has cleared up a fair amount of redness that I usually have on my elbows and feet.</li>
      <li>it makes my skin feel fresh and clean, and it actually makes my now</li>
      <li>The delivery was fast and convenient.</li>
      <li>but this line of products is absolute garbage.</li>
      <li>I guess I expected more from the product than I got.</li>
      <li>After washing it leaves my skin feeling \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; - like it&#x27;s stripping too much moisture from it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still waiting to see if the soap really clears my skin</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Also, packaging of the items was odd: the soap bars I purchased were at the bottom of a cardboard box with Styrofoam peanuts on top of them.  </li>
      <li>The soap is as good as any other brand except it&#x27;s kinda high on the price if compare to other brand I have used.</li>
      <li>I am in my 70&#x27;s and most soaps make me feel \\&quot;dried</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; and smells nice and makes my skin very soft, however I&#x27;m not sure I would purchase it again, especially at this price...</li>
      <li>I actually paid about $30 for my first 3 bars.</li>
      <li>Not disappointed but did not exactly meet my expectations.</li>
      <li>your face is sensitive!</li>
      <li>and then pimples less bumpy and red from the first wash, and when i use it i rarely get new ones.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a Dead Sea mud (silt) product to use for my problem skin in lieu of a mud mask I had once used, and purchased this based on the hugely discounted price at the time and another reviewer&#x27;s claim it helped her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and this is my opinion thus far</li>
      <li>bought the product because I wanted soft, clear skin.</li>
      <li>This soap keeps acne far away.</li>
      <li>Within a month it completely cleared my cheeks.</li>
      <li>I also use this product along with scar zone to help combat the dryness and remove the old scars and not to mention scar zone provides SPF 15.</li>
      <li>I have used Dead Sea soap in the past and absolutely loved it</li>
      <li>I got the soft part, but it definitely hasn&#x27;t helped clear my skin up at all</li>
      <li>My skin definitely feels very soft, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with over-drying.</li>
      <li>and I occasionally tan my skin to try and clear it up...</li>
      <li>My face does not feel stiff and dry like so many other products.  </li>

<li> I am an avid user of dead sea salt products and while this soap is along those lines I find it to be extremely drying compared to other brands out there.</li>

<li> bar was a little smaller</li>

<li> Amazon charges for the Premier dead sea products.  </li>
<li> I found this soap when I visited the Dead Sea in Israel three years ago</li>
<li> I have been using this product for a few years now.  </li>
<li> Heavily perfumed!</li>
<li> Now I&#x27;m not sure it says it will hydrate your skin ( I never read package labels</li>
<li> Not sure</li>
<li> but in very small amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading - Elijah</li>
<li> Absolutely the worst soap I have ever used.</li>
<li> You cannot go wrong with the price</li>
<li> If you have a bad case of acne use this soap bar.  </li>
<li> Terrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using  this soap for about a week and this is my opinion thus far (I will update later also):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap has an interesting, fresh and clean smell. It creates a large amount of \\&quot;soapy suds\\&quot; so you can see exactly where on your body you&#x27;ve gotten, instead of just guessing. My skin definitely feels very soft, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with over-drying. I&#x27;m still waiting to see if the soap really clears my skin up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I feel like it&#x27;s a good soap. Is it good enough to pay more than your typical moisturizing, nice scented, women&#x27;s soap at your local store? Not sure yet- but I&#x27;ll be sure to let you know when I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE-2/11/12**&lt;br /&gt;I bought the product because I wanted soft, clear skin. I got the soft part, but it definitely hasn&#x27;t helped clear my skin up at all and my skin has been kinda dry as of late - but then again the air is really dry and I occasionally tan my skin to try and clear it up... I like the soap. It&#x27;s really \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; and smells nice and makes my skin very soft, however I&#x27;m not sure I would purchase it again, especially at this price... I guess I expected more from the product than I got.</li>
    <li> So long as I don&#x27;t forget to wash my face with this, then I don&#x27;t break out. I&#x27;ve been using this since 2008 when I was aggressively sold one by a pretty lady.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing for acne. I my self have been using for a little over half a year. I actually paid about $30 for my first 3 bars. It was well worth it though. And I am happy that I was pulled aside in the mall by a lovely young lady that said this would help and I would be singing her praises. Well to this day I am :). Now I&#x27;m not sure it says it will hydrate your skin ( I never read package labels lol ) but it does sort of leave your skin a little dry however it exfoliates and cleans deep, that I know. Just don&#x27;t over scrub! your face is sensitive! I also use this product along with scar zone to help combat the dryness and remove the old scars and not to mention scar zone provides SPF 15. I highly recommend trying this little routine instead of the OTC acne products that haven&#x27;t worked for you. One last note, stick to it, things don&#x27;t happen overnight. Also wash your face in the morning and at night with warm water and then splash it with cold water to close pores and try not to rub your face in a towel rather pat it dry. :) then add moisturizer :) hopefully I could help someone. One last last note find out what food triggers your breakouts and stay away from it or eat it in smaller portions. Mine was dairy i still drink/eat it but in very small amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading - Elijah</li>
    <li> I was looking for a Dead Sea mud (silt) product to use for my problem skin in lieu of a mud mask I had once used, and purchased this based on the hugely discounted price at the time and another reviewer&#x27;s claim it helped her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the soap twice daily on my face by just lathering the soap into my hands or with a washcloth.  I thought that due to the hue of the soap and the fact that it has Dead Sea silt in it that it might later in a grey color, but it doesn&#x27;t (it&#x27;s a whitish lather like your typical soap).  After washing it leaves my skin feeling \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; - like it&#x27;s stripping too much moisture from it.  With acne that might be tolerable, but I find I have to moisturize every time after I use the soap (skipping the acne spots).  So the claim that this soap \\&quot;gives your skin the essential hydration it needs\\&quot; seems a little too generous for what it does.  Presumably it&#x27;s the salt in the soap that does it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Also, packaging of the items was odd: the soap bars I purchased were at the bottom of a cardboard box with Styrofoam peanuts on top of them.  Shouldn&#x27;t they have been sandwiched in between the peanuts?? The bars of soap themselves weren&#x27;t damaged, though.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, right now I&#x27;m torn between a 3-star review and a 4-star.  I&#x27;ve only used the product for about a week now, but if the dryness and squeakiness continues I might reduce the rating to reflect the three.</li>
    <li> The Premier Dead Sea mineral Mud Soap is a wonderful makeup remover and leaves the face feeling clean; a moisturizer afterwards makes it perfect.  I am in my 70&#x27;s and most soaps make me feel \\&quot;dried out\\&quot;.  This one doesn&#x27;t.  I am on my second bar.  I plan to order from Amazon again when this one is used up.</li>
    <li> I got this soap as a gift when i bought the nails care cit from barcelona., and i really liked it it makes my skin feel fresh and clean, and it actually makes my now and then pimples less bumpy and red from the first wash, and when i use it i rarely get new ones. so when my bar finished i got it from here.. the packaging was good but it took a while for it to arrive., other than that i like it thanx ;)</li>
    <li> Not disappointed but did not exactly meet my expectations. Lathers well, smells good. Results may vary depending on skin type and condition.</li>
    <li> This soap keeps acne far away. And keeps skin feeling good. Only downside is price but that&#x27;s hardly worth mentioning.</li>
    <li> I like this soap but didn&#x27;t rate it a&lt;br /&gt; Five because I only used it&lt;br /&gt;once.&lt;br /&gt;The bar was a little smaller then I thought but I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Terrible. I have used Dead Sea soap in the past and absolutely loved it but this line of products is absolute garbage. Heavily perfumed! My skin felt so tight and dry afterwards. Absolutely the worst soap I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 7 years and absolutly love the way it makes my face feel. The delivery was fast and convenient. Also the price was a lot cheaper then you can find anywhere else. Thanks Amazon for making this an easy transaction.</li>
    <li> I love the mud soap. It works great in keeping your skin healthy and smooth. When my teenage boy uses that, the acne on his face goes away. Plan on extra time to receive the product, shipped from overseas by US mail. Sender was great in communication of shipping issues.</li>
    <li> Love this soap it has a perfect pH balance for T-zone skin types. If you have a bad case of acne use this soap bar.  Wash your face every night warm to cool water temp., and use a toner by Thayer&#x27;s rose water. Great for acne prone skin types.&lt;br /&gt;This soap has a perfect cleansing level without over drying your face.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years now.  I first bought the soap in a mall in North Carolina.  Its purchase price was $50.  Since then they have made the the bar smaller but actually lowered the price to I believe $20.  You cannot go wrong with the price Amazon charges for the Premier dead sea products.  It was actually shipped from Israel so I believe the quality is the same.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use this soap!! I want it all for myself!! Its the best skin cleaner I&#x27;ve ever found. My daughter has bad acne on her chest and cheeks due to a chronic illness, and this is the only soap we&#x27;ve found to clear up the outbreaks and balance the skin. When I find it I buy as many as I can afford. I use it jealously, carefully only using on face and areas of outbreak. One bar lasts about two months.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t rave enough about this bar. I have used sooooooo many face washes over the years and nothing cleans my face like this. I used to be a huge nutrogena fan, but I would break out all the time even after washing my face twice a day. I was in the mall one day and got talked into using this product. retail $40 per bar at the kiosk. Once I used it and my face cleared up, I never turned back. Yes your skin will be squeeky clean, litterally squeeky. But give it 3 days max and you will see a difference in your skin. I will continue purchasing this for years and years.</li>
    <li> I had gotten this product at a mall kiosk and they said they could give it at half price for $25.  Such a ripoff, but finding it here was great, with an affordable price tag and great shipping.  It worked really well to clean my face and tighten my pours, without tightening my wallet for just one bar.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> The soap is as good as any other brand except it&#x27;s kinda high on the price if compare to other brand I have used.</li>
    <li> I found this soap when I visited the Dead Sea in Israel three years ago and I have been using it ever since.  The soap is long-lasting and makes my face, elbows and feet feel smooth and clean.  My face does not feel stiff and dry like so many other products.  All in all, I will be using this soap for as long as I can purchase it.</li>
    <li> This product is great if you suffer with acne. Within a month it completely cleared my cheeks. Now I don&#x27;t use anything else on my face, love it!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery &amp; Good product, Good price too. Thanking you. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is best soap in the world!  I&#x27;ve tried Jericho soap and others but nothing comes close to Premier products, thank you Adi!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I just love it. It&#x27;s great for acne prone skin and aging skin as well.</li>
    <li> Transforms your skin. It&#x27;s great !</li>
    <li> I am an avid user of dead sea salt products and while this soap is along those lines I find it to be extremely drying compared to other brands out there. The grit of the salt is also pretty fine, so if you are looking for a real exfoliation experience I would go with AHAVA or another brand as this will not get the job done for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefit to this soap is that it has cleared up a fair amount of redness that I usually have on my elbows and feet. However, I think there are products out there that can do the same for a smaller price.</li>
