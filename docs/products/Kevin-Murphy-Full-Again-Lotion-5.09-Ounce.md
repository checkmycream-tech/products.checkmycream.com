      <li>really love the product!</li>
      <li>This product is great for fine hair.</li>
      <li>I LOVED Kusco Murphy products and was devastated when they were no longer available.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine hair.  </li>
      <li>It works well, not heavy on fine hair like some styling products and it smells wonderful!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve turned into a huge Kevin Murphy fan!  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and it literally holds my hair in place for days.  </li>
      <li>I Love the anti gravity root lift</li>
      <li>I feel like I end up using more of this product than I did with the Motion Lotion.</li>
      <li>This product was just OK.  </li>

      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>I bought this product for my mom because it is her favorite for making her hair feel thinker with out drying it out</li>
      <li>I love this stuff - love all of Kevin Murphy products.  </li>
      <li>my hair has more body</li>
      <li>My hair is fuller and more manageable....</li>
      <li>Love this kevin murphy thickening lotion.</li>
      <li>My hair looks healthy and no one even knows I have fine hair.  </li>
      <li>This thickening lotion is easy to use and adds body without changing how your hair feels.  </li>
      <li>My hair is fine and was getting &amp;#34;flyaway&amp;#34; in the summer.</li>
      <li>smells fantastic and works like a charm.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so worth the money!</li>
      <li>shipped quickly and securely.  </li>
      <li>So if you have really straight, fine hair like mine, you&#x27;ll still need to find a good root lifter or your hair will wind up laying flat on top of your head.</li>
      <li>I like the softness and body that the Kevin Murphy \\&quot;Full</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s nice is that it&#x27;s not heavy</li>
      <li>I kind of has an old lady smell to it, but besides that it did make my hair noticeably thicker.</li>
      <li>this lotion really gives your hair more body.</li>
      <li>I would be even happier if I was able to get Forever Young, but it is out of stock and no idea when it will be available.</li>
      <li>Tip: if you use it and then brush your hair, you&#x27;re pretty much defeating the purpose, as you&#x27;ll brush most of the polymer OUT.</li>
      <li>While she was gone I showered and used her products, met her for dinner and the first thing she said was &#x27;you used my Kevin Murphy!</li>
      <li>;  You can absolutely notice a huge difference after one use.  </li>
      <li>The smell is the same, which is nice, but that is really the only thing good</li>
      <li>but well worth it.</li>
      <li>So far all of the products by Kevin Murphy have been outstanding.</li>
      <li>I think this product is worth the money and will replace my container when it is used up.</li>
      <li>I ordered 2 bottles and it is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>My salon sells this for way less and it is a nice salon!</li>
      <li>i put it on right after showering while</li>
      <li>I like this product very much.  </li>
      <li>This product adds fullness and does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
      <li>This innovative product works differently than all of them.</li>
      <li>I will buy more in the future</li>
      <li>So glad to be able to get it as not many places have it.</li>
      <li>to put up with the hassle to have such magic hair.</li>
      <li>The first thing is you cannot just squeeze the putty like substances and get it our of the container.  </li>
      <li>I only wish that Amazon would carry more of his products.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants their hair to look fuller and healthier !</li>
      <li>I will Definitely buy more.</li>
      <li>It does make your hair much, much fuller, and has decent hold all by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also add more the next day, etc.</li>
      <li>In this age of straight hair, Full and Thickening helps my fine slightly curly hair.</li>
      <li>My hair looks and feels much healthier when I use it.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for expanding thin curley hair.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
      <li>i get very itchy if this happens.  </li>
      <li>adds so much texture and volume to my shortish hair.</li>
      <li>Really adds a lot of volume.  </li>
      <li>This stuff does absolutely nothing to my hair besides make it smell like incense.</li>
      <li>It really gave thickening and body to my hair.  </li>
      <li>Great for thin hair-just rub through hair before blow drying.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled a few months ago to find Kevin Murphy products....</li>
      <li>It is a thick cream that does a good job of gentle thickening without weight.  </li>
      <li>I previously had hair thinning problems but this is magic.</li>
      <li>Kevin Murphy products come highly recommended from me...</li>
      <li>The first is on damp hair after washing, then I blow-dry on low while I finger-comb my hair into shape.</li>
      <li>Got this for the first time at my local salon.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t extract the product through the normal opening, must take lid completely off.</li>
      <li>It does add some volume and leaves your hair soft and pretty, not crunchy and gross.</li>
      <li>Again\\&quot; lotion gives my short very fine hair, but I have to wonder if the small rayon fibers that are supposed to create extra \\&quot;body\\&quot; will melt and stick to the hair shaft when I use a hot curling iron.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel great, volumizes like crazy when I use a blow dryer and is NEVER crunchy or flaky.  </li>
      <li>Am wondering how old the product is.  </li>
      <li>hair soft...</li>
      <li>Wow....</li>
      <li>only downside is that it needs to be kept upside down in order to get the product to flow out easier when you need to use it and thanks to the bottle design that is a little challenging.</li>
      <li>I do agree with others that the bottle design is less than desirable, but it&#x27;s totally worth it</li>
      <li>If you really want to transform your hair, I highly suggest you splurge a little on these products.  </li>
      <li>and you can barely feel it, but there is a noticeable difference in fullness and volume.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this kevin murphy thickening lotion. Thickens hair without build up or weighing it down. Would never use anything else.  Seller provided exceptional service.</li>
    <li> Works well to thicken hair, some residue left on hair, otherwise, product works as expected,perhaps I didn&#x27;t rinse hair well enough.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this product either. Did nothing for my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. So far all of the products by Kevin Murphy have been outstanding.</li>
    <li> I choose this product because I have thinning hair . This product made my hair look and fill fuller  . I would recommend this product to anyone who wants their hair to look fuller and healthier !</li>
    <li> expensive and really doesn&#x27;t make a lot of difference  &#x27;</li>
    <li> shipped quickly and securely.  excellente.</li>
    <li> Works great for just giving fullness to thin/fine hair.</li>
    <li> my hair is very thin and this product made it have more volumne.  I will buy more in the future</li>
    <li> I just started using Kevin Murphy products and this is the best.  Makes you hair fuller</li>
    <li> This product is great for fine hair. It works well, not heavy on fine hair like some styling products and it smells wonderful! So glad to be able to get it as not many places have it.</li>
    <li> I LOVED Kusco Murphy products and was devastated when they were no longer available.  I was thrilled a few months ago to find Kevin Murphy products....I was afraid he had disappeared and I would never have great hair again.  I have very fine hair.  I have tried every single volumizer on the market.  Literally.  This Thickening Lotion is expensive, but worth every single penny.  It makes my hair feel great, volumizes like crazy when I use a blow dryer and is NEVER crunchy or flaky.  I use a small amount, about the size of a nickel, rub my hands together and then run them through my hair.  I spray a little Kevin Murphy leave in lotion for thinning hair at my roots also.  My hair looks healthy and no one even knows I have fine hair.  Kevin Murphy products come highly recommended from me...the ultimate beauty and hair product junkie!!</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair and found even the slightest amount on my hair to be to heavy.  I Love the anti gravity root lift product!&lt;br /&gt;I think is is a good line of products.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and it literally holds my hair in place for days.  I highly recommend for thin hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful hair product for volumizing.  My hair looks and feels much healthier when I use it.</li>
    <li> Like it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Does what it says.</li>
    <li> This product does what I wanted it to do. My hair is fine and was getting &amp;#34;flyaway&amp;#34; in the summer. This item helps to make it seem thicker and more conditioned. I am happy with the product and price and service!</li>
    <li> Great product, makes my hair look and feel thicker.</li>
    <li> Use very little; seems to add some volume.</li>
    <li> Great product but the cost is OUTRAGEOUS!!  My salon sells this for way less and it is a nice salon!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I kind of has an old lady smell to it, but besides that it did make my hair noticeably thicker.</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT. For the complaints below, did you read the directions on how to use it? It is activated by heat, so you need to use your blow-dryer on low to activate it after you run it through your hair. I have a short pixie cut, super-straight and very thin hair, and I do TWO applications (I apply it all over, down to the roots). The first is on damp hair after washing, then I blow-dry on low while I finger-comb my hair into shape. When it&#x27;s dry, I do another application and use low heat again for a few moments. It does make your hair much, much fuller, and has decent hold all by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also add more the next day, etc. Tip: if you use it and then brush your hair, you&#x27;re pretty much defeating the purpose, as you&#x27;ll brush most of the polymer OUT.</li>
    <li> Works well for thin hair and makes it fuller.</li>
    <li> Have short hair so had a little bit of a hard time determining amount needed&lt;br /&gt;Left hair soft...no residue&lt;br /&gt;Did not have to use additional volumizer</li>
    <li> this product leaves no sign it&#x27;s even there except that your hair feels slightly thicker.  I would buy it again</li>
    <li> Got this for the first time at my local salon.  Packaging is HORRIBLE.  I store it on it&#x27;s side so I can dispense it.  The product itself is very good.  It is a thick cream that does a good job of gentle thickening without weight.  I have short hair and use about an inch plus.  That gives me all the body I&#x27;m looking for.  I also like their aerosol mousse.</li>
    <li> I have tried every hair thickening treatment under the sun: shampoos, serums, root sprays, vitamins and even a scalp laser. This innovative product works differently than all of them. It builds a subtle layer onto your existing hair with the use of a blow dryer. What&#x27;s nice is that it&#x27;s not heavy and you can barely feel it, but there is a noticeable difference in fullness and volume. The only downside is that it&#x27;s ever so slightly tacky/sticky, but it&#x27;s a small trade-off compared to the other types of creams that may thicken your hair but also leave it heavy and lifeless.</li>
    <li> great stuff....worth every penny.</li>
    <li> i have shoulder length curly hair and this product is applied to wet hair. It is the only product that I use. It acts as a styling agent as well as conditioner. it defines curls and once hair dries it can be fluffed up, no frizz. I previously had hair thinning problems but this is magic. I do agree with others that the bottle design is less than desirable, but it&#x27;s totally worth it to put up with the hassle to have such magic hair.</li>
    <li> This thickening lotion is easy to use and adds body without changing how your hair feels.  I think this product is worth the money and will replace my container when it is used up.</li>
    <li> Great Product wish this line would go on sale</li>
    <li> This does not work!  Weighs hair down. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> For years I have used Kevin Murphy Motion Lotion as a thickening product, even though it is marketed as a curl enhancer. The salon I usually buy from was out of stock, so I decided to purchase online,which is when I discovered the Full Again thickening lotion. I was super excited to try it, but the product disappointed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion seems to get stuck in the bottle, but when it finally comes out, seems thin, almost watery. I feel like I end up using more of this product than I did with the Motion Lotion. The smell is the same, which is nice, but that is really the only thing good I can say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I&#x27;ve exhausted this bottle, I will definitely be going back to the KM Motion Lotion.</li>
    <li> Bought this after it was recommended on Sea of Shoes. This stuff does absolutely nothing to my hair besides make it smell like incense.</li>
    <li> In this age of straight hair, Full and Thickening helps my fine slightly curly hair.</li>
    <li> Product arrived damaged and box partially open. Amazon was gracias enough to credit my card.. I tried some of the product and found it to dry my hair. My hair is color treated so this may be the reason for bad results. I threw the remainder in the trash.</li>
    <li> I like the softness and body that the Kevin Murphy \\&quot;Full Again\\&quot; lotion gives my short very fine hair, but I have to wonder if the small rayon fibers that are supposed to create extra \\&quot;body\\&quot; will melt and stick to the hair shaft when I use a hot curling iron.</li>
    <li> yes yes yes a milion times yes. smells fantastic and works like a charm. adds so much texture and volume to my shortish hair. really love the product! only downside is that it needs to be kept upside down in order to get the product to flow out easier when you need to use it and thanks to the bottle design that is a little challenging. but well worth it.</li>
    <li> Good product although it&#x27;s quite thick.  Am wondering how old the product is.  I can&#x27;t extract the product through the normal opening, must take lid completely off.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product.  I would be even happier if I was able to get Forever Young, but it is out of stock and no idea when it will be available.</li>
    <li> This product was just OK.  I would not purchase again. It was too expensive and probably works better with longer hair.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Arrived sooner then expected</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  Really adds a lot of volume.  Don&#x27;t use a lot though!</li>
    <li> This product adds fullness and does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> Stopped using Kevin Murphy products.</li>
    <li> love it. this lotion really gives your hair more body.</li>
    <li> Great for thin hair-just rub through hair before blow drying. Cost less than in shop. I will Definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.  I only wish that Amazon would carry more of his products.  When I check, they are almost always gone with little hope of them coming back in stock.</li>
    <li> The first thing is you cannot just squeeze the putty like substances and get it our of the container.  I had to use a long thin cosmetic brush to make the thick substance come out. On damp hair before blowdrying, I found it left my hair too hard to style and move around, it seemed to just weight my thinning hair down, not the look I wanted.  Very hard to comb through the next day for this pricey product.</li>
    <li> this product to me is invaluable.  my hair is quite short and white.  i put it on right after showering while hair&lt;br /&gt;is still wet.  style and let dry and then just sort of fluff it up or leave it as you styled it.  it is a MUST for me.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product, but the salon does not sell it. I ordered 2 bottles and it is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for expanding thin curley hair.&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is that you need to keep the bottle upside down and&lt;br /&gt;storing it that way is not easy.</li>
    <li> I loved this lotion!  It really gave thickening and body to my hair.  Only gripe I have is that the bottle it comes in does not really travel well and when getting low it is hard to get the lotion out. I ended up cutting it open and there was a lot left in the bottle.</li>
    <li> Wow....I&#x27;ve turned into a huge Kevin Murphy fan!  I used some of my best friend&#x27;s while on vacation with her, and one use (shampoo, conditioner and this) I was hooked. She left before I woke up, and we met later that evening.  While she was gone I showered and used her products, met her for dinner and the first thing she said was &#x27;you used my Kevin Murphy! Your hair looks amazing!&amp;#34;  You can absolutely notice a huge difference after one use.  Of course I went home and ordered it all and am addicted to the whole line.  You won&#x27;t be able to stop smelling your hair either! It&#x27;s so luxurious.  And the thickening lotion will last you forever...you only need a tiny bit!  If you really want to transform your hair, I highly suggest you splurge a little on these products.  It&#x27;s so worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love everything about this! My hair is fuller and more manageable.... no fly aways and holds style well. Best part is the fantastic smell. I love how this smells on my hair!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff - love all of Kevin Murphy products.  I usually buy them at my hair salon.  This was a little runnier than what I expected - the ones I get at the salon are quite thick.</li>
    <li> i like this product.  ihave to be careful not to get it on my skin ie.ears.  i get very itchy if this happens.  my hair has more body so i will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mom because it is her favorite for making her hair feel thinker with out drying it out</li>
    <li> It does add some volume and leaves your hair soft and pretty, not crunchy and gross. But you put it on the lower portion of your hair, not on the roots. So if you have really straight, fine hair like mine, you&#x27;ll still need to find a good root lifter or your hair will wind up laying flat on top of your head. Still, it&#x27;s a good product. Not sure if I&#x27;ll buy it again or move on to try something else.</li>
