    <li> Perfect for DIY protein treatments. I use as a sealant for my thin, kinky, BSL length hair. Helps my hair stay hydrated and have noticed less breakage.  I recommend for anyone with fine/dry hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far and I could tell the difference as soon as I washed it out.  But I will have to use it a few more times to get the full expectations of the product.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I add it to my personal conditioner to give myself a protein treatment and I could tell the difference immediately.</li>
    <li> Ive use this product once and it seems to work well with my hair i add it to my conditioner</li>
    <li> Love, hair is soft and shiney!</li>
    <li> It works. It made my hair stronger and shinier. It also repaired and stopped damage.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for your hair. I mixed it with a leave in conditioner and used it as  a deep conditioner for 2 hours.  Three weeks later and my hair still feels like beautiful silk.</li>
    <li> And for this reason alone im giving it two stars. They said it was raw materials which is why i couldn&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m transitioning my hair to chemical free. My medium coarse African American hair became strong and flexible with high sheen. I plan on purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any complaints. Product is as described and I&#x27;ve had no adverse effects; it&#x27;s too soon to determine any benefits. I bought this product to add to hair conditioner for a protein treatment. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> I use it faithfully with my shea moisture deep conditioners. it brings my curls back to life.</li>
    <li> So I actually use this asa mix in with my joico k pak reconstructor and it makes my hair so strong! I really love it! I just make sure I use a really moisturizing conditioner (such as Joicos moisture balm) afterwards to bring moisture back to my hair. This stuff is amazing and I love it!</li>
    <li> Pretty good. I think it helps my hair but it is a very small bottle.</li>
    <li> This mixed well with my conditioner. My hair became stronger.</li>
    <li> This protein leaves your hair SUPER SOFT!! I&#x27;ll continue using it. All you do is mix it with some conditioner and a little goes a long way! 1/3 cup of hydrolized wheat protein to 2 cups of conditioner. Also if your thinking about purchasing this protein visit GREEN BEAUTY&#x27;s channel first on YouTube!</li>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money on the typical chemical-laden protein treatment you would buy from the beauty supply shop or retail store so I gave this a try.
