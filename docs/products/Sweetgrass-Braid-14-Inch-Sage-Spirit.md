      <li>I really loved this sweetgrass, from New Mexico.</li>
      <li>This was the first time I&#x27;ve used the sweetgrass, but this one does not burn very easily.</li>
      <li>I liked the sweetgrass braids but the cost fer only 2 braids wasn&#x27;t good, they were returned, I needed more of them, I just keep searching fer large quanties of them.</li>
      <li>This is a critical component for smug and this is a great price.</li>
      <li>What a fabulous smell</li>
      <li>Smells fantastic and</li>
      <li>If you need some cheap tall grass woven into a braid</li>
      <li>Smells great, but it seems like it&#x27;s pretty old.</li>
      <li>Packaged well, and I&#x27;m enjoying it very much indeed.  </li>
      <li>Exactly as it was supposed to be :)</li>
      <li>and I will be purchasing more of these - this is my first to see what it was all about...</li>
      <li>how sweet it is, how sweet it is, thank you</li>
      <li>I took it to a friend who&#x27;s a horticulturalist &amp; it was verified to NOT be sweet grass.</li>
      <li>It smells a bit like molasses or sweet feed that you give to horses.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s just how sweet grass is.  </li>
      <li>This sweetgrass braid matched the description, and arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>I should also mention you need to buy a charcoal tablet to use with this because otherwise it smolders out too quickly</li>
      <li>After taking great interest in the Native Americans in the past couple years, I try to do &amp;#34;smudging cememonies&amp;#34; and sweet grass as ofter as I can.  </li>
      <li>Fresh grass, sweet,healing.  </li>
      <li>Smells great, burns ok, a little smaller than I thought it would be, but sufficient.</li>
      <li>The Sweetgrass braid arrived quickly and ready to use.</li>
      <li>NM is a high desert &amp; sweet grass prefers a moist marshland.</li>
      <li>they work better when they&#x27;re open)</li>
      <li>Expensive, but the best deal I&#x27;ve found for a while.</li>
      <li>Smells exactly as it should.  </li>
      <li>My only problem is that I don&#x27;t like the smell, but them again I don&#x27;t like most incense either.</li>
      <li>Thanks it was still fresh</li>
      <li>I am very excited to use this Sweetgrass as a part of a long overdue ceremony to bring peace and calm to our home.</li>
      <li>Still smudges nicely though just wish I could get something slightly thicker.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
      <li>Does not burn very well have to keep lighting it every now and then</li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>Was curious that someone from NM was selling sweet grass braids as sweet grass is NOT indigenous to NM.</li>
      <li>I never knew what sweet grass smelled like, but would describe it as &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; obviously.</li>
      <li>I can not review this item, since my dog took off with it after I opened the box and shredded it in the patio, which did smell nice for a few days!</li>
      <li>Sweetgrass is hard to come by unless you live in Arizona or New Mexico and this is as good as it always is.</li>
      <li>It smells great ,but what I learned,at least here in Sedona is that it is cheaper to buy locally as they buy in bulk&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful, arrived green and burnt slowly.</li>
      <li>That is a little deceptive for marketing because I thought I was going to get more bang for my buck.  </li>
      <li>I would definitely purchase this again, and was well worth the price.</li>
      <li>This was my first Sweetgrass Braid that I&#x27;ve purchased.&lt;br /&gt;Thought it lasted long enough to smudge around the home.&lt;br /&gt;Although if the price was lower, I would be more inclined to making further purchases.</li>
      <li>I live in NM, but come from sweetgrass territory, &amp; NM does have tall grasses</li>
      <li>They are a LITTLE on the green side, but seem to be fully dried and smoke wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Really helped me with my PTSD symptoms and actually prefer it to the meds ( minds are like parachutes ...</li>
      <li>and I usually buy my sweet grass from New Mexico.  </li>
      <li>This vendor has become my new regular supplier.</li>
      <li>True sweet grass has that aroma of faint vanilla but</li>
      <li>If you want a slow burn and the smell of sweet grass look somewhere else.</li>
      <li>Very hard to fine,</li>
      <li>Braid is not as tightly woven as one&#x27;s purchased at local health food store, and not as much grass in the braid.</li>
      <li>The smoke is amazing and it really stinks up the room so might want to disable the smoke alarms.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smudging is a must in our lives and I usually buy my sweet grass from New Mexico.  We ran out so I ordered this.  The braids are nicely done and has a great aroma.  The braids are thinner than I am used to but the quality of the product is good.</li>
    <li> The braid must not have been dry enough because I had to constantly re-light it as it was being used.  If I knew, I would have removed it from the packaging to air dry ahead of time.  It was delivered, though, in good condition.</li>
    <li> I am learning to smug my home.  The quality of this sweetgrass braid is top-notch.  This is a critical component for smug and this is a great price.</li>
    <li> Nice package.  Smells great.</li>
    <li> This in only ONE braid,  while the picture shows three.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Smells great, but it seems like it&#x27;s pretty old. The grass was very dry and brittle.</li>
    <li> Thanks it was still fresh</li>
    <li> Need a bushel of this to place all over my home.  What a fabulous smell</li>
    <li> Good Sweetgrass. You don&#x27;t need much. It purifies my home and smells great. Not too dry, so it should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased better. This product is suppose to be a bit dry, but not brown at the tips. It was a difficult burn. I&#x27;m not sure why being as dry as it was. If I had another place to purchase from, I would.</li>
    <li> Does not burn very well have to keep lighting it every now and then</li>
    <li> Does not burn easily. Have to keep relighting it.</li>
    <li> This smells like burnt leaves.  Not sweet at all.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> We loved it and will be buying more here soon thank you.</li>
    <li> they look great, nice size, and smell wonderfully. However, I cannot get the braids to stay lit. I&#x27;ve dried them for HOURS upon hours in the oven on 150°, let them sit out for weeks.. They still won&#x27;t burn.</li>
    <li> Exactly as it was supposed to be :)</li>
    <li> Just lovely.  Burns well.</li>
    <li> It smells great ,but what I learned,at least here in Sedona is that it is cheaper to buy locally as they buy in bulk&lt;br /&gt;Nothing is ever cheaper in the world than amazon , but this is</li>
    <li> I liked the sweetgrass braids but the cost fer only 2 braids wasn&#x27;t good, they were returned, I needed more of them, I just keep searching fer large quanties of them.</li>
    <li> I can not review this item, since my dog took off with it after I opened the box and shredded it in the patio, which did smell nice for a few days!</li>
    <li> I know sweetgrass is difficult to start and keep burning, but this was ridiculous.  I couldn&#x27;t keep it lit no matter what, so I had to keep lighting it over and over.  When cleansing a home and almost acre of land, that becomes tiresome and annoying.</li>
    <li> This is great for burning in rituals to clear out and purify the space. My only problem is that I don&#x27;t like the smell, but them again I don&#x27;t like most incense either.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find locally and I use this a lot, I am happy that it is easy for me to get it from Amazon</li>
    <li> I use these for a custom smoking blend I make. Exceptional quality. They are a LITTLE on the green side, but seem to be fully dried and smoke wonderfully. They&#x27;re especially fragrant compared to other braids i&#x27;ve bought in the past. This vendor has become my new regular supplier.</li>
    <li> I have never used sweetgrass before and wanted to try this.  it arrived promptly and was just like it was pictured.  I would purchase this  again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product but the problem is its 1 braid not 3 as in the picture.  That is a little deceptive for marketing because I thought I was going to get more bang for my buck.  I should also mention you need to buy a charcoal tablet to use with this because otherwise it smolders out too quickly but that&#x27;s just how sweet grass is.  It says on the package not in the Amazon product description.</li>
    <li> I love the item but the picture showed 3 strands and I recieved 1 strand braid but its okay loved it anyway</li>
    <li> Smells exactly as it should.  Packaged well, and I&#x27;m enjoying it very much indeed.  I have nothing more to say.</li>
    <li> The smell of this sweetgrass is so nice like vanilla. how sweet it is, how sweet it is, thank you</li>
    <li> I cannot believe they are even selling this product. Not worth it at all. I do not recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> I love this sweetgrass braid, it&#x27;s very nice and quality made.  Smells fantastic and I can&#x27;t wait to use it. I&#x27;ve just received it and have not smudged with it yet.</li>
    <li> Only 1 braid not 3 as pictured, really green too and not braided tightly. Dissapointed for the money spent.</li>
    <li> I really loved this sweetgrass, from New Mexico. It smells wonderful, arrived green and burnt slowly. Sweetgrass is a beautiful part of the smudge, for those who aren&#x27;t familiar with it. It smells like vanilla and is used, after you have cleared and cleansed a space (or the energy around someone) with tobacco, followed by sage or cedar.  I would definitely purchase this again, and was well worth the price. It must have kept me for at least two months.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I&#x27;ve used the sweetgrass, but this one does not burn very easily. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s too green or not supposed to burn well. Anyway, I will try again!</li>
    <li> Will buy this again from this seller, Very sweet smelling, Well braided and good length.</li>
    <li> The Sweetgrass braid arrived quickly and ready to use. I am very excited to use this Sweetgrass as a part of a long overdue ceremony to bring peace and calm to our home. I will use it in combination with Cedar and Sage in order to smudge and spiritually cleanse our home as well as us.</li>
    <li> We used this in a smudging ceremony and the sweetgrass braid had a very nice frangrance and burned well.  Please note - I only got one long braid--not 3 like in the picture. But the braid was longer than those shown in the picture.  A little expensive for one braid but we thought was good quality</li>
    <li> Best price anywhere out there and really fresh. Order time was great and no problems with shipper... good folks to work with.</li>
    <li> Was curious that someone from NM was selling sweet grass braids as sweet grass is NOT indigenous to NM. NM is a high desert &amp; sweet grass prefers a moist marshland. I live in NM, but come from sweetgrass territory, &amp; NM does have tall grasses but they are NOT sweet grass! True sweet grass has that aroma of faint vanilla but the braid I received just smelled like grass. I took it to a friend who&#x27;s a horticulturalist &amp; it was verified to NOT be sweet grass.</li>
    <li> This sweetgrass braid matched the description, and arrived quickly.  I had a very hard time keeping it lit though.  (It would probably work better with charcoal rounds.)  It has a nice scent to it.  If you want to smudge but don&#x27;t care for the scent of sage, you may want to give this a try.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for someone that uses the calming affects of the smudge sticks very good product. Really helped me with my PTSD symptoms and actually prefer it to the meds ( minds are like parachutes ... they work better when they&#x27;re open)</li>
    <li> Fresh braid, perfect sweetgrass aroma</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping.  Braids are as pictured.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> If you need some cheap tall grass woven into a braid this is the product for you. If you want a slow burn and the smell of sweet grass look somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Sweetgrass is hard to come by unless you live in Arizona or New Mexico and this is as good as it always is. Expensive, but the best deal I&#x27;ve found for a while.</li>
    <li> I love this... I wish I could make my own but since I can&#x27;t, this is the next best thing and I will be purchasing more of these - this is my first to see what it was all about...</li>
    <li> This was my first Sweetgrass Braid that I&#x27;ve purchased.&lt;br /&gt;Thought it lasted long enough to smudge around the home.&lt;br /&gt;Although if the price was lower, I would be more inclined to making further purchases.</li>
    <li> Hate this! Won&#x27;t even burn. No great smell, Boo,</li>
    <li> A little disappointed in the size of the sweet grass braid.  Still smudges nicely though just wish I could get something slightly thicker.</li>
    <li> I received the item as promised, and just absolutely love the smell of the sage.  Looking forward to using it around the house.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works great for smudging. Bought before and appears nothing has changed! The smoke is amazing and it really stinks up the room so might want to disable the smoke alarms.</li>
    <li> I bought this as part of a gift, but loved the smell. I never knew what sweet grass smelled like, but would describe it as &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; obviously. It smells a bit like molasses or sweet feed that you give to horses. The strands are definitely long enough that you can cut them and use in multiple rooms.</li>
    <li> If you look back in history, Sage and Sweetgrass were used by ALL native American tribes.. Its used for purfication and the smell is wonderful. After taking great interest in the Native Americans in the past couple years, I try to do &amp;#34;smudging cememonies&amp;#34; and sweet grass as ofter as I can.  Very hard to fine, but I went to Amazon, who is now my favorite place ever, and it always has the things you cant find anywhere else. Great price, great service and not gouging the customer. Thank you AMazon!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great, burns ok, a little smaller than I thought it would be, but sufficient.</li>
    <li> Very Nice product. Smells great and is just what it says.</li>
    <li> Fresh grass, sweet,healing.  Picture of product(s) might lead some to believe that they will receive 3 braids.  Braid is not as tightly woven as one&#x27;s purchased at local health food store, and not as much grass in the braid.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed the scent of Sweet grass, and these brades were top quality. Very satisfied. Thank you so much.</li>
