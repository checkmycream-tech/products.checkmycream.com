      <li>This is an amazing cologne.</li>
      <li>Nice lavender/anise scent with woody as well as animalic notes.  </li>
      <li>nice parfume, a grown up kind of smell, not too sweet and suitable for a nice evening with your girl, to my opinion great match for the elegant business type of guy, not to use for all occasions.</li>
      <li>Love , Love , Love it !</li>
      <li>i received many compliments from ladies(+25 years old), otherwise the service from Amazon is excellent...</li>
      <li>Puts it in his top 5 scents.</li>
      <li>Probably one of the most manly scents in history.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s OK.</li>
      <li>Will be ordering more. :)</li>
      <li>Love and adore it....</li>
      <li>A bit more moderen scent.</li>
      <li>So glad I purchased this..highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Lot of compliments from men, but even more complements from women.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the most versatile fragrance I have owned.</li>
      <li>everything it&#x27;s cracked up to be and more.  </li>
      <li>This is for the grown and sexy.</li>
      <li>Yves Saint Laurent&#x27;s Pour Homme was a bit more interesting to my nostrils.</li>
      <li>simply is the best frag from YSL...</li>
      <li>I really love it.</li>
      <li>love how this cologne smells.  </li>
      <li>Love the scent, very easy to over apply, easy on the trigger.</li>
      <li>Great longevity and decent projection.  </li>
      <li>It smells very clean without being sweet or cloying (kind of like classier Barbasol)</li>
      <li>Price was good, delivery was fast.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as strong as some other perfumes and doesn&#x27;t suffocate  my breath like them, and that&#x27;s the best thing.</li>
      <li>It does have that clean shaving cream scent, which I love.  </li>
      <li>Gorgeous scent that reminds me of what older colognes used to smell like, a very welcome change to the very &amp;#34;alcohol&amp;#34; like smells of recent colognes.</li>
      <li>This one was a huge hit.</li>
      <li>I enjoy this scent as an evening scent for cooler weather.  </li>
      <li>however I will enjoy it from time to time.</li>
      <li>I like my cologne light.</li>
      <li>the smell of this stuff is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>excellent projection,long lasting and very versatile, smell like \\&quot;barbasol\\&quot;..</li>
      <li>She meant it in a good way though, but it should point out that this is probably not a scent for the young hipster going out to a club.</li>
      <li>Can be sexy on the right person.  </li>
      <li>It has a rich, evocative characteristics which say &#x27;grown-up&#x27; without being stuffy.</li>
      <li>I would feel very comfortable wearing this fragrance as an accompaniment to a smart suit, evening at the theatre etc.</li>
      <li>But this is so much more beautiful and complex.</li>
      <li>It lasts for a full day, and is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I know they have even some cool newer sents out like Nuit, etc</li>
      <li>I probably won&#x27;t order another bottle, but it&#x27;s not bad at all it just doesn&#x27;t work for my wife...</li>
      <li>Its not bad, but its not what all the hype says it is.</li>
      <li>Nice cheap daily driver.</li>
      <li>More commplex and not as one dimensional as the older scents.</li>
      <li>If you love the classic fougeres with a citrus/lavender opening especially with anise notes reclining on rich woody notes, you will love this.</li>
      <li>Amazon pricing is very competitive and with free shipping you cannot compare with anyone.</li>
      <li>It seems appropriate for damn near any situation you could imagine.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything worth doing so yet.</li>
      <li>Everything from the stylised, saber-like flacon with its uber sophisticated curves and lines says quiet sophistication and unique appeal to me.</li>
      <li>Now mind you, I have owned some decent colognes in my day(Angel men, 1 million, Burberry London and Brit, L&#x27;eau D&#x27;Issey, Gaultier&#x27;s Le Male, etc), and YSL&#x27;s gorgeous Rive Gauche takes the cake.</li>
      <li>I really like this EDT spary, very gentle and smooth fragrance.</li>
      <li>Kouros (was my dad&#x27;s favorite)&lt;br /&gt;A recent favorite of mine is the Rice Gauche.</li>
      <li>It seems more for the 30 and above crowd.</li>
      <li>the smell is ok ONLY FOR 5 min...</li>
      <li>Exactly the smell I was looking for as it reminds me of my grandfather and barber shops.</li>
      <li>An intense, brooding and powerful herbal concoction of a scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn over a hundred different types of colognes over the years and this is really one of my favorite.  </li>
      <li>and at first spray it&#x27;s intense.</li>
      <li>i really hope it&#x27;s not a knock off.  </li>
      <li>I only buy Aqua, Summer, Light, Sport colognes.</li>
      <li>i have loads of experience with fragrance and have a very well trained nose.  </li>
      <li>I payed lot of money thought I will get the REAL one...</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t have a lot to say about this purchase, just that I gave it as a cologne and the person loves it.</li>
      <li>Rive Gauche is a modern barber shop scent.</li>
      <li>I love all the YSL line for Men&#x27;s colognes.&lt;br /&gt;Decades ago I enjoyed regular YSL (came in red or black cap),</li>
      <li>and I get complimented on this all the time, unlike any of my more expensive scents (those are more for me, though).</li>
      <li>Very Mature scent that opens up very well after about 4 hours.</li>
      <li>Deliciously deep and barbershop-like, with a dimensionality that entertains me for hours, not like the one-dimensional colognes that are out there now; very unique, if only for its novelty.</li>
      <li>This one was so highly recommended and highly rated online.</li>
      <li>Relatively new (12 years old) take on classic barbershop classics!  </li>
      <li>Classic, strong and long lasting.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a professional unoffensive classic cologne.</li>
      <li>VERY masculine, working man&#x27;s scent.</li>
      <li>The oft-repeated references to Barabasol shaving cream are definitely warranted, as it definitely has that clean, creamy vibe.</li>
      <li>if you want smell like other frags(aquatic or citric) forget it, but if you want smell clean and masculine this frag is all you need..</li>
      <li>The one disclaimer would be this: Young men, 15-25yrs should probably stay away.</li>
      <li>this one is my wife&#x27;s least favorite.  </li>
      <li>Its not gentle as well, its just right.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t go wrong with YSL, love M7 as well, but can&#x27;t wear as often as I live in Florida, Rive Gauche is easier in our climate.</li>

<li> This is very unlikely to be a crowd pleaser, in a world full of &#x27;Bleu de Chanels&#x27; and such like, this offering from YSL stands out as audacious, herbal and has a light air of antiquity about it, without being plain old-fashioned.</li>
<li> It is long lasting.</li>
<li> i&#x27;d like to exchange it to be honest just to see if it&#x27;s just a bad bottle.  </li>
<li> Extremely complex scent profile—at times it&#x27;s very musky and powdery at the end</li>
<li> curve and grey flannel...</li>
<li> After a very long search for what would be my \\&quot;signature\\&quot; scent, a.k.a.</li>
<li> Not very alluring I think.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Relatively new (12 years old) take on classic barbershop classics!  Nice lavender/anise scent with woody as well as animalic notes.  Very similar to Azzaro pour homme, but slightly darker and yet, fresher.  Can be sexy on the right person.  I enjoy this scent as an evening scent for cooler weather.  Casual or business, it can suit all occasions.  Great longevity and decent projection.  If you love the classic fougeres with a citrus/lavender opening especially with anise notes reclining on rich woody notes, you will love this.</li>
    <li> Probably one of the most manly scents in history. Classic, strong and long lasting. Can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing cologne. Period. After a very long search for what would be my \\&quot;signature\\&quot; scent, a.k.a. my everyday scent, I have found it. Now mind you, I have owned some decent colognes in my day(Angel men, 1 million, Burberry London and Brit, L&#x27;eau D&#x27;Issey, Gaultier&#x27;s Le Male, etc), and YSL&#x27;s gorgeous Rive Gauche takes the cake. It&#x27;s the most versatile fragrance I have owned. It seems appropriate for damn near any situation you could imagine. The one disclaimer would be this: Young men, 15-25yrs should probably stay away. It seems more for the 30 and above crowd. Just my two cents. The oft-repeated references to Barabasol shaving cream are definitely warranted, as it definitely has that clean, creamy vibe. But this is so much more beautiful and complex. Thank you to the Fragrance master Jaques Cavallier, Tom Ford, and Yves St. Laurent for making this beauty come to life.</li>
    <li> Very good! Recommend.</li>
    <li> excelente producto, exactamente como la fotografia, llego sin retrasos, excelente precio, recomendado para todos los compradores venezolanos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;excellent product, exactly like the picture, I get no delays, excellent price, recommended to all buyers Venezuelan</li>
    <li> I really like this EDT spary, very gentle and smooth fragrance. You cannot go wrong with this one. Amazon pricing is very competitive and with free shipping you cannot compare with anyone.</li>
    <li> Excellent soothing products. This product can not be compared .a axon is great to get this product.  Appreciate your help.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is toned down. Not very alluring I think. Yves Saint Laurent&#x27;s Pour Homme was a bit more interesting to my nostrils.</li>
    <li> simply is the best frag from YSL... excellent projection,long lasting and very versatile, smell like \\&quot;barbasol\\&quot;..you know...if you want smell like other frags(aquatic or citric) forget it, but if you want smell clean and masculine this frag is all you need..i received many compliments from ladies(+25 years old), otherwise the service from Amazon is excellent...</li>
    <li> An intense, brooding and powerful herbal concoction of a scent. Everything from the stylised, saber-like flacon with its uber sophisticated curves and lines says quiet sophistication and unique appeal to me. This is very unlikely to be a crowd pleaser, in a world full of &#x27;Bleu de Chanels&#x27; and such like, this offering from YSL stands out as audacious, herbal and has a light air of antiquity about it, without being plain old-fashioned. I would feel very comfortable wearing this fragrance as an accompaniment to a smart suit, evening at the theatre etc. It has a rich, evocative characteristics which say &#x27;grown-up&#x27; without being stuffy. This is the antithesis of bland and boring or sweet and sickly. Does YSL ever do poor fragrances?? A winner.</li>
    <li> My dad had mention to me concerning Rive Gauche I thought he was fooling around but I was amazed. I really love it.</li>
    <li> I payed lot of money thought I will get the REAL one...&lt;br /&gt;while I opened it the smell is ok ONLY FOR 5 min...&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER EVER order from you again&lt;br /&gt;this is not nice way to do bussniss...&lt;br /&gt;It is a terrible way to CHEAT CUSTOMER&lt;br /&gt;I recommend &amp;#34;AMAZONE&amp;#34; not to work with that company</li>
    <li> Rive Gauche is a modern barber shop scent. It reminds me of  vintage Azzaro cologne. Recommended for men above the age of 30. I won&#x27;t reach for it on a daily basis however I will enjoy it from time to time.</li>
    <li> Seriously... It smells like the old school Gillette Foamy Shaving Cream! Exactly the smell I was looking for as it reminds me of my grandfather and barber shops. VERY masculine, working man&#x27;s scent.</li>
    <li> This is for the grown and sexy. Very Mature scent that opens up very well after about 4 hours.</li>
    <li> This cologne is great for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a professional unoffensive classic cologne. It lasts for a full day, and is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good buy at a great price.</li>
    <li> Nice cheap daily driver. It smells very clean without being sweet or cloying (kind of like classier Barbasol) and I get complimented on this all the time, unlike any of my more expensive scents (those are more for me, though).</li>
    <li> Bought this as a  gift for a friend and he loves it. Puts it in his top 5 scents. Price was good, delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> I love all the YSL line for Men&#x27;s colognes.&lt;br /&gt;Decades ago I enjoyed regular YSL (came in red or black cap), Kouros (was my dad&#x27;s favorite)&lt;br /&gt;A recent favorite of mine is the Rice Gauche. A bit more moderen scent. More commplex and not as one dimensional as the older scents. I know they have even some cool newer sents out like Nuit, etc..&lt;br /&gt;I just have not been to the mall in the ages. Otherwise a few walk-bys the men&#x27;s cologne section I might be wearing one of those by now.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like using any perfume for years, may be I haven&#x27;t found anything worth doing so yet. But I have been using this for a year and it&#x27;s OK. It&#x27;s not as strong as some other perfumes and doesn&#x27;t suffocate  my breath like them, and that&#x27;s the best thing. and the price is good compared to well known brands.</li>
    <li> I like my cologne light. I only buy Aqua, Summer, Light, Sport colognes. I do not like over powering cologne. If I buy colognes that do not fall into these categories, its usually a hit or miss. This one was a huge hit. Its not over powering. Its not gentle as well, its just right. It is long lasting. I am quite impressed.</li>
    <li> This one was so highly recommended and highly rated online. Very disappointed I like the Yves line for men, but this one smelled like licorous. Its not bad, but its not what all the hype says it is. Maybe its just my taste and it is awesome, but I have tried a lot of colognes and this one was just meh.</li>
    <li> the smell of this stuff is fantastic.  everything it&#x27;s cracked up to be and more.  but the stuff does just not last on me.  i&#x27;ve read this is a powerhouse cologne...no more than 2-3 sprays.  2-3 sprays on me is very subtle.  no projection whatsoever.  i&#x27;ve read that it may be a stale bottle.  i really hope it&#x27;s not a knock off.  i have loads of experience with fragrance and have a very well trained nose.  this is very weak and almost seems watered down to me.  i&#x27;d like to exchange it to be honest just to see if it&#x27;s just a bad bottle.  i&#x27;ve read reviews where people say this stuff lasts 12 hours and even through a shower.  for me it&#x27;s basically a skin scent an hour later.  curve and grey flannel...2 sprays of those are nuclear.  i can smell them sometimes up to 16-20 hours later.  anyone else have similar experiences with this?</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t have a lot to say about this purchase, just that I gave it as a cologne and the person loves it. YSL knows how to make quality products, you can&#x27;t go wrong with any of their fragrances. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> YSL makes only one thing I like and it is this fragrance. PLEASE DO NOT STOP PRODUCTION. This is the only cologne I wear and its definitely one people remember me by. This is my smell</li>
    <li> Love , Love , Love it !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn over a hundred different types of colognes over the years and this is really one of my favorite.  It does have that clean shaving cream scent, which I love.  My wife is not a huge fan of it though.  Earlier this year I was making a purchase at a store and the girl at the checkout told me that I &amp;#34;smelled like her dad&amp;#34; (I&#x27;m 42).  She meant it in a good way though, but it should point out that this is probably not a scent for the young hipster going out to a club.</li>
    <li> I absolutely Love this Cologne, smells just like Ruehl!!! So glad I purchased this..highly recommended. Will be ordering more. :)</li>
    <li> It came in great packaging from Amazon, so I knew the cologne bottle was safe.  The YSL sticker was still on the plastic over the box, so I knew it was authentic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how this cologne smells.  I bought it as a replacement for Ruehl&#x27;s Signature cologne.  It is woody, but not too overpowering.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Buenos dias, el dia de hoy me tome la molestia para calificar esta compra, la cual cumplio con los parametros que esperabamos. Quedamos conforme con la compra, gracias.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, very easy to over apply, easy on the trigger. Can&#x27;t go wrong with YSL, love M7 as well, but can&#x27;t wear as often as I live in Florida, Rive Gauche is easier in our climate.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous scent that reminds me of what older colognes used to smell like, a very welcome change to the very &amp;#34;alcohol&amp;#34; like smells of recent colognes. Extremely complex scent profile—at times it&#x27;s very musky and powdery at the end and at first spray it&#x27;s intense. Deliciously deep and barbershop-like, with a dimensionality that entertains me for hours, not like the one-dimensional colognes that are out there now; very unique, if only for its novelty.</li>
    <li> I tried a few different colognes than I normally do this time.  I like this one but out of the 5 (Ungaro, Usher, Creed and Bvlgari) this one is my wife&#x27;s least favorite.  I probably won&#x27;t order another bottle, but it&#x27;s not bad at all it just doesn&#x27;t work for my wife...</li>
    <li> I have been using this fragrance for years.  It is subtle yet noticeable.  Lot of compliments from men, but even more complements from women.  May be my chemistry, but this works well for me.</li>
    <li> Love and adore it.... one of the best</li>
    <li> nice parfume, a grown up kind of smell, not too sweet and suitable for a nice evening with your girl, to my opinion great match for the elegant business type of guy, not to use for all occasions.</li>
