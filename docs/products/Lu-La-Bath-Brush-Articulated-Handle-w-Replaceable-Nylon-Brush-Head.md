      <li>I like the construction and the idea is awesome.  </li>

      <li>If the locking handle could be re-designed or made from a tougher material so that it didn&#x27;t break, that would be wonderful.</li>
      <li>Well I have needed this for along time and searched to find the perfect one!</li>
      <li>An excellent product.</li>
      <li>The idea of this type of brush could be ideal for someone with mobility problems if it were made stronger of metal/steel, not plastic.</li>
      <li>A good gift!</li>
      <li>However, the loofah head is great.</li>
      <li>My husband is the user of this brush and says it is great.</li>
      <li>It is a great idea.</li>
      <li>Great, I just wish they made one where the head artticulates.</li>
      <li>And conceptually it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>Great</li>
      <li>This is a great brush.  </li>
      <li>Latch works great</li>
      <li>but it is a great tool.  </li>
      <li>how but the lifetime warranty was pleasantly honored</li>
      <li>Good quality brush.  </li>
      <li>I received this item and loved it&#x27;s mechanism of angles and accessory heads.</li>
      <li>- it was that good.</li>
      <li>The brush size is good.</li>
      <li>But, if you will purchase a bottle of liquid soap/body wash and squirt some on the brush, you get a good lather and cleaning.  </li>
      <li>One of its good features is its moveable system.  </li>
      <li>Still a great product and even better customer service.</li>
      <li>Packaging was excellent and price was right thank you</li>
      <li>These brushes are wonderful at first</li>
      <li>This product is even better than advertised!</li>
      <li>Glad I found this online!</li>
      <li>I would have liked a more sponge like brush head!</li>
      <li>The best thing is that when it is bent at an angle it is very sturdy as well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy this product came along as I have suffered greatly for some time before finally getting relief from Mony!!</li>
      <li>This is the best and strongest bath brush I have found so far!</li>
      <li>My husband loves this brush and it&#x27;s easy for him after having hip replacement surgery!  </li>
      <li>though I plan to keep using this brush, I&#x27;ll look around for something more satisfying to my skin.</li>
      <li>Really love that this sponge comes with an extended arm.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
      <li>Great tool with adjustments that really work.</li>
      <li>The brush is okay</li>
      <li>Would love to have another for replacement and improve my review.</li>
      <li>What more can you ask for.......long and adjustable.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this product.</li>
      <li>I think they need to be shorter and more flexible.</li>
      <li>As it turns out, the brush that comes with the handle is actually the best for exfoliation.</li>
      <li>Should have a better handle with a better grip.</li>
      <li>I might like it better when I try the Loofah Sponge Head on it, which I also bought.</li>
      <li>With this, if you want it to do more, you have to buy additional items.</li>
      <li>The very easy fix for this is don&#x27;t extended all the way  leave or more click before it&#x27;s full extension</li>
      <li>I would love to have a more secure and permanent sponge on a stick with this length</li>
      <li>Clean toes again!  </li>
      <li>Bush is soft but too, non slip grip is great.</li>
      <li>The head is of sufficient size, and the handle is easy to grasp.  </li>
      <li>Well made and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It is sturdy, easy to use, and compact when folded.</li>
      <li>Brush head is a great back scratcher in or out of the bath but, for me, the sponge head is better for soaping.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t easily reach all the places I hoped it would.</li>
      <li>The heads are easy to remove and replace.  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve had it for a couple years now and its still going strong.</li>
      <li>But it works well despite this slight problem, and I have been very happy with my purchase.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are quite soft and pleasant to use.  </li>
      <li>This item is fantastic.</li>
      <li>so I used a waterproof glue which proved to make the LuLa Brush much more useful for the wife ...</li>
      <li>Can be bought perhaps more economically as a kit ([[ASIN:</li>
      <li>I liked it so much</li>
      <li>Works great for a while, then positioning snap gives way under moderate pressure (goes from 135 degrees to 180 degrees)</li>
      <li>so I can do my feet in the shower and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be available.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Follow up: after two years of light use the lever that holds and releases the arm broke.  </li>
      <li>If the head were jointed separately from the handle it would be more useful.</li>
      <li>Can not manage to use comfortably.</li>
      <li>Great for scrubbing back</li>
      <li>Form fitted handle sits comfortably in my hand.  </li>
      <li>and I love a good back scratch.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s adjustable and has a full line of replaceable brush heads to choose from for just the right feeling your looking for!!</li>
      <li>Now they would be great for any other cleansing activity, I&#x27;m sure - just not exfoliation.    </li>
      <li>It is a mixture of something about the size that dentists use for polishing teeth and is just about as friendly.  </li>
      <li>This one is great and will work for a long time.</li>
      <li>After my toes were clean, I used to to put lotion on the tootsies too.</li>
      <li>so I can clean any part of my body including the bottom of my feet, another problem area for me.</li>
      <li>I am a tall, large man, and I looked in many DFW stores for a brush like this, to no avail.  </li>
      <li>EXCELLENT BRUSH TO USE FOR THE HARD TO REACH PLACES.</li>
      <li>This is true.</li>
      <li>Since I am disabled, and sit on a shower bench, I thought it would be ideal, and it is, except for when the handle gets too slippery and falls out of my hands.</li>
      <li>it seemed to be ideal until it arrived and is to heavy for her to handle.</li>
      <li>There is practically no way to hold this so as to reach the back and give it a good scrub.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more for people who want to gently whisper cleanliness across their skin.</li>
      <li>When completely folded it is nice and compact for storage.</li>
      <li>This is a good back brush.</li>
      <li>The different angles are great and it makes it easy to wash many places,with my back injury</li>
      <li>After my first review, the company, evidently, read it and sent me another scrub brush with locking handle and, in addition, a loofah head - for free!</li>
      <li>The second handle has held up much better, although it could still be more sturdy.</li>
      <li>If the same strength was used in the lower part of the handle as is in the upper part it would be perfect.</li>
      <li>loved the long handle</li>
      <li>But the reality is, the handle is a nice idea, but the heads don&#x27;t hold soap well, they don&#x27;t lather up and in the end, you can&#x27;t clean your back with just a sponge or bristles, you need soap.</li>
      <li>This brush is made very cheap and has really soft bristles.</li>
      <li>Handy product for my husband who recently had hip surgery and cannot reach his feet in the shower...</li>
      <li>My 40-year old long-handled Fuller Brush still works better than this Mony.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The brush is okay but it doesn&#x27;t easily reach all the places I hoped it would. If the head were jointed separately from the handle it would be more useful. The mid-handle joint is not right for all needs.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Two months later the jointed handle no longer holds positions. This renders the brush nearly worthless. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great, I just wish they made one where the head artticulates.</li>
    <li> I received this item and loved it&#x27;s mechanism of angles and accessory heads. Unfortunately the design has the weakest part of the handle in a place where most of the pressure is applied. This caused the handle to break. If the same strength was used in the lower part of the handle as is in the upper part it would be perfect. The break is approx. two inches from where the head is inserted. I would purchase another if that design change were implemented.</li>
    <li> I am a tall, large man, and I looked in many DFW stores for a brush like this, to no avail.  It has a very long handle, and the head is quite flexible, so I&#x27;m able to reach all regions of my back.  The bristles are \\&quot;firm,\\&quot; so that takes some getting used to.</li>
    <li> What more can you ask for.......long and adjustable.  Perfect for me...I know others have complained but I don&#x27;t have anything to complain about.  Would have been 5 stars if they would have included a second brush head at this price.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it articulates, and is rather sturdy. In fact it&#x27;s a bit sturdier than I thought it&#x27;d be. When properly bent, It is long enough to reach my middle back, which made me happy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and then I tried it. And was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate the fact that the brush head is so SOFT. TOO soft, in fact. The bristles are just WAY TOO SOFT. When I finally reached to brush my back with it, it felt like NOTHING. I didn&#x27;t get that satisfying, almost-back-scratching feeling that I got from an older, more basic brush with stiffer bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I plan to keep using this brush, I&#x27;ll look around for something more satisfying to my skin. I saw that the head is removable... Maybe they make a different brush head with tougher, more manly bristles? If I find it, I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
    <li> So sorry I bought this back brush.  It is unwieldy, regardless of what angle you set it at.  You cannot adjust it to precisely the right angle, only to the set positions.  Because the brush is set further away than the handle, you can&#x27;t get enough pressure when scrubbing your back.  My 40-year old long-handled Fuller Brush still works better than this Mony.</li>
    <li> the only problem is the angle adjustment breaks after extended use. you must not put a lot of pressure when washing</li>
    <li> This item is fantastic. It is long and will reach anywhere. The best thing is that when it is bent at an angle it is very sturdy as well. It has a heft to it but it&#x27;s not too heavy. I have arthritis and have a hard time holding things as well as bending to reach parts of my body to wash. This is exactly what I was looking for. An excellent product.</li>
    <li> Well made, sturdy and very useful for someone with  limited shoulder range. I am especially grateful for the ninety -degree angle adjustment.  I  bought a second one, removed the nylon bath brush head and jury-rigged a hairbrush.  It is the only way that I can brush my hair in the back.  . It works  , but  I wish they would  make a replaceable hairbrush head for this wonderful tool .</li>
    <li> It is a God send! I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for anything like it and no success! I usually break most things like this, because I am pretty strong even though I am disabled, but this one takes the punishment!    I really like how you can snap the head out for thorough cleaning; I&#x27;m very fastidious that way. As it turns out, the brush that comes with the handle is actually the best for exfoliation. I tried the other heads - except the pumice one - and none of the others was sufficient. They all came off their base if I rubbed too hard, so they just weren&#x27;t good for that. Now they would be great for any other cleansing activity, I&#x27;m sure - just not exfoliation.    The brush could have been a little more stiff, but fortunately the brush has several large flexible quills inset into the head that make up for it. This is the only head I bought that had a fixed brush head where the bristles can&#x27;t separate from the base. What I mean is the flexible quills, for lack of a better term, are what the other sponge type heads lock to. They are not glued on in the other designs and can come off if one is not careful. I clean the brush head separately and give it a vigorous cleaning and let it stand until dry. The handle almost cleans itself.    I&#x27;m very happy this product came along as I have suffered greatly for some time before finally getting relief from Mony!!</li>
    <li> Folds ok, but awakward to use and the brissels are hard. This makes it uncomfortable to use. I ended up not using this product and instead reverted back to sponges instead.</li>
    <li> Good quality brush.  Really like the adjustable folding handle design.  For me, the bristles may be slightly stiff, but they may soften over time. The bottom portion of the handle should be a little flatter, than round.  If your hand is a little soapy, the brush has a tendency to twist.  Very east to store.  Just fold it closed  and hang it over the towel rack.</li>
    <li> This brush met my expectations. the adjustable feature is very helpful in the bath usage. shipping was fast and well packaged. would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Well I have needed this for along time and searched to find the perfect one! The brush works and it works well but to all who have given it a bad review, I just haven&#x27;t had this experience yet. The interchangeable heads are a very large plus and they stay secure as long as you make sure you&#x27;ve put them in right and they are clipped in. Packaging was excellent and price was right thank you</li>
    <li> I would rate this product a one except that it seems to be made of decent materials and might even be sturdy and hold up providing anyone uses it.  The angles don&#x27;t work.  There is practically no way to hold this so as to reach the back and give it a good scrub.  On top of this idiotic goof, the brush itself is odd.  It is a mixture of something about the size that dentists use for polishing teeth and is just about as friendly.  The nylon bristles seem completely ineffective.  I am very disappointed in its lack of functionality.  If you are used to natural bristles or loofa, you will not find anything here to like, but the real problem is that despite being adjustable, none of the angles are particularly useful.</li>
    <li> This is a piece of junk.  Broke in half.</li>
    <li> It has been about a month since I purchased this bath brush.  I got the nylon head as I read a review that said it was stiff and I love a good back scratch.  I also purchased the sponge bristle head combo.  I read some of the other reviews and could not relate at all to those who did not just LOVE this brush.  I love the different angles that it adjusts to.  Just perrrrfect for my back!  The heads are easy to remove and replace.  The brush folds for compact storage.  I found this brush to be extremely well made.  Form fitted handle sits comfortably in my hand.  I have bought ever other kind of brush on the market trying to find something that would give me a good back scratching in the shower and this is it!!  Well made and easy to use.  I am sure this will be the last back brush that I will ever need.  Only down side is I have been trying to find the pumce head to add to this brush so I can do my feet in the shower and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be available.</li>
    <li> The brush is designed to break at the neck, just below the brush.  This forces you to buy a new one.</li>
    <li> Basically it comes down to being to costly for what it does.  You can find a foot brush in the dollar store.  With this, if you want it to do more, you have to buy additional items.</li>
    <li> I am a 62 year old physician and medical school professor who had a left hip replacement five weeks ago as of 8/15/2011. I understand all the hip precautions, the awkwardness in showering that the precautions impose and the patient&#x27;s (my) need for thorough cleansing. The brush worked very well for 3 1/2 weeks. Then, one day, while scrubbing the bottom of the foot on the operated leg, the locking  mechanism of the hinge broke and the brush will no longer lock into position. I can still scrub the bottom of my feet, but I cannot reach all of my back. And it takes a lot longer to scrub my foot well. I have to shower using a transfer bench because of a separate operation on the opposite (right) hip done at the same time as the left hip replacement. This means that I cannot bear much weight on the non-replaced hip for a period of at least 6 weeks post-op. This makes me very awkward in the shower and I miss the locking feature! It is a great idea. I still recommend the brush - just be aware that the locking mechanism is not very robust. If the locking mechanism had held up, I would have given the brush 5 stars, rather than 3 stars.  A tip for those who buy this brush. Some reviews claim that the brush will not lather up well. This is true. But, if you will purchase a bottle of liquid soap/body wash and squirt some on the brush, you get a good lather and cleaning.  Purchased at Amazon, late June 2011.  Updated review September 23, 2011  After my first review, the company, evidently, read it and sent me another scrub brush with locking handle and, in addition, a loofah head - for free! The second handle has held up much better, although it could still be more sturdy. However, the loofah head is great. The one I have now is beginning to wear out, but that is expected. To show how sold I am on the product,I just recently ordered 3 more loofah brush heads as well as a sponge and brush combo head. I give this company 5 STARS for their customer service. In this day and age, whenit is hard to get anyone to stand behind their product, this company does stand behind their product. I recommend the product highly. You will not be disappointed. This articulated, locking handle brush is well thought out and just what the Dr. ordered.  At least this doctor has ordered more heads and uses the device! I would buy one at twice the price.</li>
    <li> loved the long handle but I found the bristles to soft, it didn&#x27;t really feel like it was cleaning.</li>
    <li> Long enough and adjusts to reach all of my back. Bush is soft but too, non slip grip is great.</li>
    <li> I was not happy with this item. The glue used to attach the sponge to the plastic head didn&#x27;t even last for 2 weeks of daily use. Very flimsy. Do not buy this item.</li>
    <li> This is a good back brush. It has rubber dealios as well. You push a button and adjust at the same time to several different positions. Good for back and other hard to reach places. Would be helpful for those with diminished arm, shoulder and hand   strength. I like it!</li>
    <li> cheap for the money and only come with a very soft brush</li>
    <li> My husband loves this brush and it&#x27;s easy for him after having hip replacement surgery!  Glad I found this online!</li>
    <li> This brush was everything they said.  It is sturdy with a long enough handle to reach everywhere (I&#x27;m a big guy).  It&#x27;s too bad it doesn&#x27;t have a small round head attachment to reach private parts better, however.  After a month&#x27;s use, there&#x27;s no sign of wear.  Great brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow up: after two years of light use the lever that holds and releases the arm broke.  Now it will not stay at an angle, only straight out.</li>
    <li> the flex mechanism fails rather soon and would have been better also with a little more of a head angle</li>
    <li> Handy product for my husband who recently had hip surgery and cannot reach his feet in the shower...</li>
    <li> The bath brush is nice and long, but my mother said the piece in the middle that sticks out some, prevents her from cleaning back without it getting in the way.  I thought maybe I could twist around, but not!</li>
    <li> Works great for a while, then positioning snap gives way under moderate pressure (goes from 135 degrees to 180 degrees)</li>
    <li> I recently had a hip replacement. This product enabled me to shower. It is was very helpful. I still use it daily and no problems.</li>
    <li> So far, this bath brush has met all my expectations.  As soon as I opened the box, I knew this was what I needed.  The lock in-place handle works perfectly(allowing me to scrub all areas of my back and under arm, where I could not reach because of limited mobility). I use liquid soap on the brush, it holds the soap so well that I need to rinse under running water when done.  This is my second review of this brush, after using for a few months, I noticed the lock in-place handle does not stay locked.  The idea of this type of brush could be ideal for someone with mobility problems if it were made stronger of metal/steel, not plastic.</li>
    <li> One of its good features is its moveable system.  One can change its position - very helpful. A good gift!</li>
    <li> Love the idea of this brush, but in reality it needs a  rubber handle all the way around, or some other material to keep it from sliding  out of my hands when it gets soapy.. Since I am disabled, and sit on a shower bench, I thought it would be ideal, and it is, except for when the handle gets too slippery and falls out of my hands.</li>
    <li> Pros, it&#x27;s bendable, and the brush is not rough on your skin,  Some people have said that the brush doesn&#x27;t do a well job when doing your back because it&#x27;s handle or pole hits your shoulder and there by keeping from touching your skin,  The very easy fix for this is don&#x27;t extended all the way  leave or more click before it&#x27;s full extension and you won&#x27;t have the problem mention above, I&#x27;m a disable vet, I have to sit in the shower to scrub and this is very helpful.</li>
    <li> Love the brush but the catch that holds the angle broke after a month on 2 different ones.</li>
    <li> The different angles are great and it makes it easy to wash many places,with my back injury it is a blessing to me.It makes life a lot easier and less stressful.</li>
    <li> I like this product, And the fact that it folds makes it very convenient. I find that it is a little long for our shower, And the hand grip is not good when it is wet so I have to hold it with a washcloth so it doesn&#x27;t slip out of my hand.</li>
    <li> this was purchased for my 89 year old mother. it seemed to be ideal until it arrived and is to heavy for her to handle.</li>
    <li> High quality product in terms of bristles and plastic but it is very slippery when wet which is exactly the opposite of what it should be. Should have a better handle with a better grip. No way I can hold it with just one hand which makes it very difficult to use.</li>
    <li> i have fibromyalgia and this is a little awkward but better than having nothing</li>
    <li> Works great! Had recent hip surgery and this brush reaches my feet so I don&#x27;t have to bend down.</li>
    <li> I use the brush to get to areas that are harder to reach.  The bristles are soft enough to be comfortable, yet stiff enough to be effective.  Overall, structural rigidity could be better, and it&#x27;s hard to grip when hands are soapy.  A little pricey, but a good product for my needs.</li>
    <li> These brushes are wonderful at first but they do not hold up.  They do not stay at the angle you set .</li>
    <li> This is the best and strongest bath brush I have found so far! It&#x27;s adjustable and has a full line of replaceable brush heads to choose from for just the right feeling your looking for!!</li>
    <li> Great for scrubbing back</li>
    <li> no longer works as sold, does not stay in any bent position....only straight out. Need it bent!!!! no good straight.</li>
    <li> The angles really don&#x27;t work very well (although they do stay in place beautitfully) and there are some nylon cylindrical projections in between the brush wires that are unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service of Soontex (the distributor of this product here) is, however, out of this world. They contacted me after having read my review and went way above and beyond any call of duty to make this customer feel appreciated and grateful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hat&#x27;s off!</li>
    <li> Look, I ended up buying every head Mony had available to try to work with this; it&#x27;s expensive! But the reality is, the handle is a nice idea, but the heads don&#x27;t hold soap well, they don&#x27;t lather up and in the end, you can&#x27;t clean your back with just a sponge or bristles, you need soap.</li>
    <li> Too bulky for in the shower brush will not lock in position would not recommend</li>
    <li> Can not manage to use comfortably.</li>
    <li> Great tool with adjustments that really work.</li>
    <li> I have six artificial joins which creates a bit of a problem reaching parts of my body during a shower. Most back brushes are too short or not shaped properly to be able to reach parts of my back. The &amp;#34;Lu La Bath Brush - Articulated Handle&amp;#34; is long enough and adjustable enough so I can clean any part of my body including the bottom of my feet, another problem area for me. I&#x27;m glad I found this product. Another plus for this is the ability to change the head.</li>
    <li> Broke the 2nd time I used it. Surprising since it&#x27;s solid, but that hinge is a weak spot.&lt;br /&gt;Do not want another!</li>
    <li> My husband is the user of this brush and says it is great. I personally do not like the feel of a brush on my skin for the use of cleaning. It helps him reach all parts of his back &amp; am sure it would be fantastic for someone with limited motion as an assisting device.</li>
    <li> This brush is made very cheap and has really soft bristles. If you want you&#x27;re back to still be dirty when you get out of the shower, buy this brush. However the package came on time and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s long which is what I wanted.  But you can&#x27;t get the good spots on your back because its so long.  Changing the angle of the head works, but it still is just awkward to use.  I like the construction and the idea is awesome.  Its just not working for me all the way.  I need it to be telescope rather than articulate.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband. He&#x27;s a heavy weight lifter, so his muscles are pretty large and he can&#x27;t get to his sides or back to clean. This brush is perfect for someone like him. It&#x27;s also very study. We&#x27;ve had it for a couple years now and its still going strong.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush.  I like it so much that this is my third one.  The handle on the first two broke.  However, there is not another folding bath brush that comes close to this one in the ability to lock the handle in different positions and the brush is soft enough for all body parts yet firm enough to clean thoroughly.  The brush bristles are long enough to get in between those toes too.  If the locking handle could be re-designed or made from a tougher material so that it didn&#x27;t break, that would be wonderful.</li>
    <li> Brushes purchased locally rarely last a year, so tried this one. Seems to be of high-quality construction, but for me the brush is too soft, causing me to look for another. I am a guy, however, and this may be engineered for women.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d really thought I&#x27;d found what I was looking for in a back brush - it was that good. And conceptually it&#x27;s great. It appears well-made, but isn&#x27;t - at least mechanically. The locking mechanism is iffy and in less than 3 months, broke completely. The only thing that holds it in place when locked is a miniscule plastic tab - which broke off. I think it was under-engineered. Glad I waited to order other heads for it, as I&#x27;d have been out not just the $ for the brush, but for the accessories.</li>
    <li> The handle is long and folds in the middle into several angles making it easier to reach anywhere. It appears to be quite sturdy. I bought the  loofah  sponge head attachments which works well.</li>
    <li> Really love that this sponge comes with an extended arm.  I have trouble with arthritis and really need to be able to use this for all areas to keep clean.  Too much info I know but it is a great tool.  I just wish the stick came with the sponge glued on.  After use it does start to tear away but I bought several head replacements to counter this.  I like that I can fit a variety of sponge types on this handle but again, the sponge head tends to get torn from the base after a few uses.  I would love to have a more secure and permanent sponge on a stick with this length but I am not able to find anything.  This works for the time being and is easy to clean and attach other sponge types as needed.</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is long and well-articulated. The positions are excellent for reaching those hard-to-reach place. The brush size is good. The product is sturdy and seems like it will hold up over time. The locking positions are solid and the brush is well-attached to the handle. When completely folded it is nice and compact for storage. (SEE UPDATED INFO BELOW)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is too soft. It is soft enough for use on a baby. Most people shopping for a bath brush are hoping for the ability to scrub a little; otherwise we&#x27;d be purchasing a sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grips on the handle are insufficient. Once wet, particularly if your hands are soapy at all, the brush can spin in your hand. When you&#x27;re already fighting a too-soft brush, it can be quite frustrating. It looks like the grip is rubber, but it is also hard plastic and the nubs are very, very small. For some areas I find myself giving up on the handle and just holding the brush head. This defeats the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A minor \\&quot;con,\\&quot; the loop on the end is very small. If you have a detachable shower head you can remove it to hang the brush from your shower head holder, but otherwise you&#x27;ll need a hook somewhere in the shower if you plan to keep it in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to remove a star and take away some of the credit from the \\&quot;PRO\\&quot; description. The locking mechanism for the handle seems to be much weaker than anticipated. Because the brush is SO fine and SO soft, it requires a bit of pressure to work. The locking mechanism for the arm broke under pressure. Not HUGE pressure, just enough to create any sensation of the brush being on your body. I think the fact that the brush is so fine the entire thing because fatally flawed. It&#x27;s more for people who want to gently whisper cleanliness across their skin. Those who want a brush to do what a brush is supposed to do will be disappointed. It was a strange design choice, but alas, this is the choice they made.e.</li>
    <li> I bought this and it broke after 2 uses. Right at the adjustment area it broke and will not stay in any position but straight. Would love to have another for replacement and improve my review.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  I think the brush part is a little too soft.  I have another long handle brush that has worked great for several years.  I&#x27;m not sure I really needed one where the handle can be adjusted at different angles.  I had my hip replaced and had read the reviews on it, but I probably could have done without this.  I might like it better when I try the Loofah Sponge Head on it, which I also bought.</li>
    <li> This brush is nice and long like I like. There were so many other brushes that were &amp;#34;long,&amp;#34; but not long enough for me.  This one is great and will work for a long time.</li>
    <li> Good Idea, poor execution. The handle is too long, I kept bumping it on everything in the shower. Then the hinge lock stripped out, so it will no longer hold it&#x27;s angle if you put any pressure on the brush. Overall, a good concept, but a poor execution of the design. It&#x27;s also very heavy for a back brush...</li>
    <li> The handle is impossible.  It&#x27;s neither sturdy nor will it keep the brush where you want it.  Good idea; very poor execution.</li>
    <li> Serves a purpose in reaching back and feet in shower.  I would have liked a more sponge like brush head!</li>
    <li> Ergonomic design makes scrubbing your entire back a pleasure to use.  Am just hoping it has a long life of usage...</li>
    <li> I got this shower brush to help with showering after a hip replacement.  It has been a real help in washing my lower extremities, as there is just no way to directly reach your feet after such a surgery.  The bristles are quite soft and pleasant to use.  The head is of sufficient size, and the handle is easy to grasp.  The only down side to this product is that the articulating handle does not securely lock into the various positions, and as such it changes positions when you don&#x27;t want it to with only mild pressure on the handle.  But it works well despite this slight problem, and I have been very happy with my purchase.  If you need this brush for long term use, it is nice that the bristles can be changed out.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Too heavy for an ALS SUFFERER. The loofa / sponge  attachment broke or separated after 1 ( one) use so I used a waterproof glue which proved to make the LuLa Brush much more useful for the wife ...</li>
    <li> The Lu La Bath Brush makes showering so much easier, for those with limited mobility.  I liked it so much I have ordered several other heads, to increase its use.</li>
    <li> As usual, these items are awkward to use.  They just don&#x27;t seem to bend in the right places to reach the back of the legs, etc when you&#x27;re sitting in the shower.  I think they need to be shorter and more flexible.</li>
    <li> I like the bath brush as far as being able to reach my back,in all the hard places to get at. As far as the grip, I believe they should have put more rubber on the handle, so that the handle is easier to grip in the shower. The handle is very slippery when soap gets on it and tends to slide in your hands.</li>
    <li> This product is even better than advertised! It is sturdy, easy to use, and compact when folded. I had never given much thought about my back brush (traditionally used wooden ones) but with the ability to choose the best handle angle with this brush,  I am washing previously hard to reach  places on my back far more comfortably and effectively. The alternate brush heads (loofah, lotion applicator, etc) switch out easily and quickly with the nylon head that is included. This is a must for &#x27;maturing&#x27; folks who are finding their flexibility diminishing: this adjustable brush does the bending for us! Definitely a 5 Star product! (SEE BELOW FOR AMENDED REVIEW/reason for number of &#x27;stars&#x27;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oct. 14, 2013: Review UPDATE: after 7 months of using the LuLa back brush, it broke at the hinge. It no longer can stay at different angles and is virtually useless as a straight brush since the broken hinge prevents it from staying rigid enough to scrub. While it may seem like 7 months since purchase is a long time, my actual use of the brush numbers less than three dozen times. I don&#x27;t scrub unnaturally rigorously so brush should have lasted longer.  I have contacted MonyUSA which sells this product and am awaiting their response. I will further update review if they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oct.18, 2013: Review UPDATE: I immediately received a replacement from MonyUSA which also included EVERY possible style of replacement heads! I am very impressed with speed &amp; thoroughness of company response. I have increased the stars to 4 (would do 4.5 if I could) but cannot give an unequivocal 5 stars since the brush did break. Still a great product and even better customer service.</li>
    <li> mine broke and I have no idea how but the lifetime warranty was pleasantly honored</li>
    <li> Still in use today. Wish the bristles were stiffer though.</li>
    <li> A little awkward to use (would have been nice to have had one more articulated joint just behind the head) but, all in all, allows me to reach where my arms won&#x27;t allow my hand to go. Brush head is a great back scratcher in or out of the bath but, for me, the sponge head is better for soaping.</li>
    <li> its heavy and awkward</li>
    <li> I had double knee surgery and unable to shower.  I got this baby here and had my caregiver get me a bucket of water....  Clean toes again!  Very sturdy.  Latch works great, it will not budge once you put it in the position you want.  After my toes were clean, I used to to put lotion on the tootsies too.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father who was in a nursing home for PT after having a hip replacement (at 92). He likes it. So did his physical therapist, who asked where I got it. It seems well made. Can be bought perhaps more economically as a kit ([[ASIN:B008ZAAJ3U Lu La Bath Brush Gift Set - Adjustable Handle with 3 Interchangable Heads]]). Changing the heads was easy for me, but might be more difficult for someone with arthritis or vision problems.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT BRUSH TO USE FOR THE HARD TO REACH PLACES.</li>
