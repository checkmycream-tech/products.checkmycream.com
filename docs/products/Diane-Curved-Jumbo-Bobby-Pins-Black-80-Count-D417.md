<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best Pins I have ever used...Keep my hair in place beautifully!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really understand how big these were when I bought them, so that&#x27;s my bad. But I didn&#x27;t like how the black on the pins was flaking off. It made it very messy to use them</li>
    <li> Great giant bobby pins. Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> These pins are not good, the black painting that coat the pin comes off in your hair after several use.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of curly hair so I thought these would work better. I&#x27;m honestly content with it but not extremely happy. I feel they don&#x27;t hold my hair as good as other brands. For the price and quantity it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> these are so great and keep my thick hair in place - gonna have to order more because i keep misplacing them</li>
    <li> Black coating peels off.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done ! &amp; cheapper then buying at the beauty supply. It came in two days I have no complaints what so ever !</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and good!!</li>
    <li> I love these bobby pins! They are great for updos, since they are curved they hold tight to the scalp. Great value!!!!!</li>
    <li> The pins work just like they&#x27;re supposed to, but have one very nice advantage.  The curve to the pin makes for a secure and comfortable fit.  An added extra is the plastic box they&#x27;re in.  I also ordered a box of smaller pins and the two boxes stack neatly in my medicine cabinet and keep the pins all together.  In the greater scheme of things this is small, but if I get enough small helps like this it makes a busy life easier and I&#x27;m all for that.</li>
    <li> I love that they are curved. Back in the day I would have to bend the straight ones. But not anymore!!!!</li>
    <li> The way I lose these will probably need a new tub sooner than later. But the price beats anything at any store. And the tub makes for easy storage</li>
    <li> I should have ordered longer pins.</li>
    <li> These are okay. Not what I was hoping for which were some heavy duty pins that I could use to hold my long hair up into a bun. I had a few of these pins break when I first tried to use them.</li>
    <li> I like the curve in these bobby pins, because it does not leave dents in my hair.  They are also much more comfortable than the regular straight ones.</li>
    <li> i ordered these bobby pins cause I liked the fact the pins were jumbo and when I got them I was glad they are strong the other simple ones bend right away and don&#x27;t really hold I recommend</li>
    <li> I like the curvature and size of these, but the paint on them is extremely cheap. It wears off during the first or second use and then the pins snag my hair! The pins look terrible with chipped paint. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a few weeks back and to my surprise, they&#x27;re better than I had imagined. I love these things, they&#x27;re long to hold more hair, the curve is perfect to not only hold the hair better but they also fit perfectly on your head.  Another good thing about this product is that it comes in a resealable container instead of just on a piece of cardboard.  All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love the shape and size of these, but I have blonde hair, so they don&#x27;t fade into it.  The black only option is depressing!</li>
    <li> perfect for my dark thick hair, love</li>
    <li> They are bobby pins, they work!</li>
    <li> These are sturdy and coated surface helps to prevent hair catches when inserted. But, they are hugh and clear meant for someone who has an overabundance of hair!</li>
    <li> I love these. I have thick, waist length hair and these pins easily hold my hair up in different buns. They are longer and thicker than normal bobby pins. The slight curve makes hairstyles more comfortable against my scalp.These pins do not stretch out and do not fall out during wear. I have had no trouble with the paint chipping and I wear these almost daily. Really good product!</li>
    <li> Great strength, they don&#x27;t lose their hold in my hair.  I have sleek hair and this is the only one that holds.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen curved bobby pins before.  They came as described and work well.  I would recommend and repurchase when I need more.</li>
    <li> I have used &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; size bobbie pins with the curve for years.  I bought these by mistake without noticing the size.  They are THICKER, and LARGE.  I love them!  They are about the length of my pointer finger...so be warned.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I really loved these. I have really thick, hard to manage hair. When I use the short, regular bobby pins, I have to use at least five or six of them to keep my hair in place. Then I end up throwing them away because they become bent open/out of shape and don&#x27;t keep my hair up anymore. These jumbo bob pins don&#x27;t ever lose shape so I&#x27;ve been able to use them over and over. They also never fall out of my hair like the regular ones, and they&#x27;re curved so they stay in place. Super great hold! I have to order some more of these soon because everyone keeps taking them from me. I would say if you have thick, heavy hair, these pins are very effective.</li>
    <li> These bobby pins are fantastic! the only reason they are getting 4 stars is due to the chipping paint that happens. I have VERY thick hair and I can use two to pin up a bun. that has never happened!!</li>
    <li> Good bobby pins for it&#x27;s price. I just added this with Amazon&#x27;s add-on item feature just to use what&#x27;s left of my gift card and to my surprise I fell in love with them instantly.</li>
    <li> The curve is nice feature, the end doesn&#x27;t break off and catch hair which is always a plus</li>
    <li> I had [[ASIN:B001A3AVBE Diane Combo Bob Pins, Black, 50 count]] previously. You can find my review for them at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.amazon.com/review/R1E4DW080GGODD/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed by how securely they hold my thick hair into bun, that i went ahead and ordered Diane 2.5&amp;#34; Curved Jumbo Bob Pins, thinking they might be same. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, these pins are also really strong in holding hair together. You can not go wrong with Diane pins at all.&lt;br /&gt;However, i don&#x27;t find them versatile enough. Due to the curve, i have to make sure that they are in curving alignment with my scalp for them to secure properly, whereas the Straight Jumbo pins i could just pick and pin into hair any direction without worrying about if i&#x27;m pinning them correctly. I find myself, reaching for the straight pins more often than the curved ones when working on hair buns.&lt;br /&gt;Its completely personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;Quality wise, both are very strong in securing hair. I did find that paint does chip off after some time, but i&#x27;m using it almost everyday, and they are mostly hidden in hair, so i don&#x27;t mind the paint as long as its holding the hair as secure with or without the paint.&lt;br /&gt;I might go ahead and purchase the straight Jumbo Pins again, and keep using these ones too. However, i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;m NOT switching to another brand. I have tried a loooottt of brands and nothing secure my hair as good as these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**If you found this review at all helpful, please take a minute to let me know by clicking the button saying this review was helpful to you.

    <li> Just received one today,the round box was littered by the peeled off black oil paint in the inside, and the fetid smell of paint came out as I opened the box.&lt;br /&gt; The steel is good, but the paint horrible.&lt;br /&gt;No way this was caused by shipping, as they are inside a plastic box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;  I now start to notice specks of the black paint on my face and even near my mouth. Not gonna risk ingesting the paint by using these pins anymore. I threw the whole box</li>
    <li> These bobby pins with the curve are great. Such a small design change makes such a great difference. It naturally curves with your head and therefore stays in without pulling your hair.&lt;br /&gt;A great gift for the girl who does a lot with her hair or puts in up frequently because you don&#x27;t find them in your local convenient store.</li>
    <li> I thought these would be too large, but for the price I bought them anyway.  They turned out to be great.  Very sturdy.  I use them as a hair clip, not as pins for updos.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, silky, slick hair that is very hard to hold.  Most hair accessories just slide out of my hair.  These bob pins are fantastic for my hair.  They hold it well and stay in place.  They don&#x27;t pull or break my hair when I put them in or when I take them out.  If you have hard to hold hair, give these a try.  I hope they work as well for you as they do for me.  I highly recommend these bob pins.  And, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product, and received a cheap hair-coloring kit instead. I would recommend not purchasing.</li>
    <li> Delivered earlier than what I thought..the package seemed to have a little amount of pins. But they were all counted for</li>
    <li> The bobby pins are certainly solid, but they are gigantic!  These probably wouldn&#x27;t be good for those with fine hair or a tiny head.</li>
    <li> Seriously guys i was so excited to finally have these bobby pins but the black literally comes off with the slightest touch. it&#x27;s annoying.. the only reason i gave this two stars was because i found myself using way less bobby pins and it hold the hair more in place. i never had to worry about it coming out</li>
    <li> Great for wrapping my hair at night!</li>
    <li> Comes bigger than I thought</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re just bobby pins, so if you want large curved bobby pins then these are for you, I&#x27;ve had no problems.</li>
    <li> For some reason these things are so painful, I&#x27;ve lost hairs using them. Ouch! I couldn&#x27;t understand the ratings before &amp;#34;how bad can a bobby pin be?&amp;#34; Oh now I know.</li>
    <li> I would purchase again.  They do hold well and grip to my medium (thickness) type hair.  I can pull them out without ripping out my hair.</li>
    <li> The curvature is perfect for my head &amp; they never give me headaches.  One pin holds my bun up all day while I do errands &amp; I have hair down to my bum!  They peel &amp; chip a bit (minus one star) but they&#x27;re cheap.  They are very tight &amp; always seem to snag one single strand of hair when I remove them.  I need to either stretch them open a bit before I use them, or get my fingers inside my bun &amp; pry it open before removing.  I guess I&#x27;d rather have them too tightly closed instead of too open.  I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
    <li> I think these are made to hold rollers in place, but I use 2 of them to hold half of my hair back in place of a barrette and they work great.</li>
    <li> This product seemed like a steal when I ordered it, but it sadly became somewhat useless because once the black paint chipped off after a few uses I didn&#x27;t want to use these bobby pins because they were SO noticeable in my hair because of how long they are.</li>
    <li> These pins are just what I&#x27;ve been looking for. I&#x27;ve looked in every store that I new carried bobby pins just couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere. I just wish they had them in the 1.5&amp;#34;-2&amp;#34; inch size as well. They work very well in holding your hair.</li>
    <li> I was thinking of not buying these because of other reviews, but I&#x27;m glad I did. Yes, they do flake after several uses, but that&#x27;s really not a big deal and, honestly, I&#x27;ve had that happen with several types of hair clips. Also, someone complained that they were tight, but I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s a bad thing. On the first or second use they may be a little more difficult to open, but after that they are fine. Besides, all that means is that they will hold you hair securely. Whenever I manage to loose these, I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> first of al the bobby pins are like to freakin bg for your head there not curved there just huger than life its self and Then they peel the black stuff on the pin just continuesly peels off and then your left with a silver bobby pin i didnt order that its to big for my head and my head is pretty big i only use them when i put my hair in a bun or un other clients with updo&#x27;s nothing more and the break and bend easily dont buy this ish</li>
    <li> Long enough and strong enough to hold my wig in place</li>
    <li> Great large bobby pins. The container is a bit large for the pins.</li>
    <li> Although I was two pins short (yes I counted them upon arrival). I love these pins. Excellent for pin curls and hair wraps.</li>
    <li> The tips of these grab my hair.</li>
    <li> These are great for holding your hair close to your head because they are curved.  The large size makes them easy to use, and I always have some in my pocket now in case I&#x27;m going to the gym or it gets warm.  My only problem with these is that I can&#x27;t find them in blonde or brown, only black.  I use them anyway.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price!!</li>
    <li> A big ole tub of pins. Great for roller sets or buns if you have super long, curly hair like me.</li>
    <li> When I use these bob pins the black plastic rubs off leave my fingers with black plastic 95% of the time. Does the job but Poor quality&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t pay too much attention when buying these, and they have the bend in the middle. They weren&#x27;t too hard to work with, but when trying to open or close them it&#x27;s a little difficult.</li>
    <li> Too big for my head. Love the tub they&#x27;re in...wish you made smaller curved pins.</li>
    <li> Larger than regular size.Worked out well.</li>
    <li> The right size and a great price.  I purchased as an &amp;#34;add on item&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery and strong durable long bobby pins that actually hold my hair in place.  Convenient clear  tub container.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for $4.99 a few months ago; I see they are now reduced to $2.00.  These come packaged in a small plastic tub, and the bobby pins are loose inside.  When they arrived, the black paint on every bobby pin was chipped.  The chipped paint created sharp edges, and I would never use these in my hair because of that.  When I began the process for returning this item, I noticed that I&#x27;d be responsible for the return shipping.  That alone makes it not worth the effort to return the item.</li>
    <li> I do appreciate Amazon offering add-on items, however these pins at $2.00 are not worth buying.&lt;br /&gt;The pins are made of very, very thin material and they twist and bend when i try to pry them open.</li>
    <li> Love these. Very comfortable to pin up super thick curly hair. I also like that they&#x27;re curved.</li>
    <li> Love these!  The mold to your head and stay firmly in place. Use them in a theater production where I had to hold a huge heavy wig on my head, these worked like a charm.</li>
    <li> the item was shipped damage the container was cracked.</li>
    <li> Stronger than the ones i buy in the stores and fast shipping. Longer which are excellent for long hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s bobby pins, what more can you say? They look and do what they were supposed to do. Great with my wigs. I&#x27;m new to wigs so I had to figure out how to not get them to show thru the wig but I&#x27;m good now, not too much u can say about bobby pins lol</li>
    <li> I know bb pins aren&#x27;t supposed to last forever, and it&#x27;s not like I use copious amounts of hairspray or sweat like a mule.  After about 2 uses of each pin, they are noticeably rusty.  There&#x27;s a lot of them, so I don&#x27;t envision running out anytime soon, and the price was certainly right.  They &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; hair really tight, so that&#x27;s a bonus.  So I would buy, but cautiously if you think these would last longer than they would.</li>
    <li> These worked well, and the little rounded ends didn&#x27;t pop off like they typically so with the other brands. Also, I liked the slight curve of these...I felt the weer more secure &#x3D;) Plus, you can&#x27;t beat it for $2!</li>
    <li> This is my 16-year old daughter&#x27;s review: These are the best bobby pins I&#x27;ve ever had. I have gone through so many bobby pins from different stores, and I would lose over half of them because they wouldn&#x27;t stay tightly in my hair, or just because I was careless and misplaced them. Since these are curved, they stay in my hair very well. I am so careful with where I put these, because I don&#x27;t want to lose them!! But I use them every day to do my hair. I had to buy another container of them. They are super great! Now the paint does chip..but only a little. It&#x27;s not a big deal, they still work amazing!</li>
    <li> Good quality and the price is right.</li>
    <li> These are the PERFECT hair pins to use. They are long, curved, and pin hair exactly how you want it to. They are not cheap looking or cheap feeling. I use these all the time and order them regularly and i wouldnt use any other bobby pins as long as I live :)</li>
    <li> The length is what I needed and because I&#x27;m always losing them, I don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on these pins. That being said, when I opened the container the pins were already chipping and flaking in the container. They looked cheap if such a thing is possible for bobby pins. Will use and hope they won&#x27;t chip in my hair. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Like most have said, I am worried about the black paint coming off, which is what keeps this from being 5 stars. However, I was looking for something sturdier than the standard bobby pin as I have very thick, curly hair. This does the job without feeling like I have to use a crowbar to get it open. Great find for the price!</li>
    <li> I have very long, thick hair and these bobby pins keep it all in place when I throw it up in a topknot. No complaints. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Very bad quality. Smell a lot and paint comes off. Ask for a refund!</li>
    <li> Nice, secure grip, and the pins don&#x27;t seem to loose their hold with frequent use. I have thick, heavy hair and these pins are strong enough to secure buns. The black paint flakes right off - but at this price, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> The Diane Jumbo Bob Pins look as if they are old. The paint on the pins came chipped in its tub. They continue to chip and peel with wear, looking old and used. Terrible quality. Waste of money--DON&#x27;T BUY!</li>
    <li> They came quickly. A perfect big size. and just what i need for holding my hair in a bun, or any style</li>
    <li> Just received  my bobby pins. Glad that finally found them curved.  They follow the contour of the head and are comfortable. Rubber tips are oversized and stick out. Plastic tub is a great idea for storage but not for shipping. Black paint cracked and chipped.</li>
    <li> The black coating comes off easy and gets trapped in your hair.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect them to be so large... At first I was disappointed.  But after I tried them out, I will never buy the smaller ones again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are GREAT!  They hold my hair tightly and don&#x27;t budge throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long and thick hair.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these bobby pins, I have a lot of very thick hair and these bobby pins keep my hair in place all day. I&#x27;m the type of person that loses bobby pins frequently and because of that I didn&#x27;t notice the paint chipping off on my hair until I was down to two bobby pins. It does chip badly if you keep using the same two bobby pins over and over again. I can deal with the chipping because of the fact that they are curved so they contour to my head and for me they do not budge all day. The best part I can use two of these bad boys and my hair looks fab whereas I was using 4-6 of the short ones you buy at walmart.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a filler item for fsss. They offer very strong, yet lightweight hold. My hair has quite a bit of body/springiness to it and I can get away with one of these pins for holding past the chin length bangs and a big section of crown hair off my face. The pins don&#x27;t slide out or lose their grip with use. The flaking paint is the only concern for me. There&#x27;s so much of it, I&#x27;m actually not ruling out testing the chips for lead.</li>
    <li> Overall, I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I gave these a 4 not 5 star rating because (as other reviewers have pointed out) the paint on the inner side of the pin chips. I opened the tub to find black flecks covering the inside of the container and a bit got on my hands which was off-putting. That said, these are so much better than the drugstore (Goody, Scunci) products I am used to. The extra long length is nice, and the curve helps the pin slide on smoothly and wear much more comfortably (like I can barely feel it once its in). I follow Kate on the Small things blog and Diane bobby (bob?) pins were an item she recommended. I&#x27;ve tried a few of her hairstyles and while my results were ok, they weren&#x27;t as good as I wanted. These pins are quite strong and they hold my hair EXACTLY where I put it instead of shifting and loosening like I am used to, thus I&#x27;ve been able to replicate my fav hairstyles much better. A few reviewers have said it broke or snagged their hair upon removal which I haven&#x27;t experienced. I do not care for the chipping paint, but these work so well its worth it.</li>
    <li> Very good quality, stay tight, and the curve makes them super comfy to wear.</li>
    <li> These jumbo pins are awesome and stay put all day long!</li>
    <li> Giant container of hairpins.  What&#x27;s not to love?  Very durable, don&#x27;t bend at all.  Great bargain value.</li>
    <li> The pain on the inside of pin sticks together. Then makes and edge to cut and grab hair. It&#x27;s on every pin.</li>
    <li> These are a great size. I love the curve. I definitely would buy more curved jumbo bobby pins...just not this brand. The black paint comes off on everything.</li>
    <li> Great item.great for pin ups</li>
    <li> I like to say that these pins each come with there own personality&lt;br /&gt;pros : some pins do hold up hair perfectly whether you have long or short hair, personally they work better for thick hair&lt;br /&gt;cons: on some pins the paint chipped off very easily , they were a bit hard to open , they pulled hair really bad , * didn&#x27;t work well with thin hair they slid right off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;READ THE DESCRIPTION THEY ARE 2.5 INCHES LONG SO STOP COMPLAINING THAT THERE BIG  WHAT ELSE DO YOU EXPECT THEY DO SAY JUMBO FOR A REASON! A lot of people are complaining that they are are too big well no effin s*** learn to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally at this point the pins could go wither way for everyone they can either be the best pins ever or the biggest pile of crap ever for the price i guess why not take a gamble on them</li>
    <li> Works well. Holds all day and night.</li>
    <li> They were really huge. I guess I didn&#x27;t read the JUMBO part. I would give this product a better rating, but the paint was all scratched off of the pins. So I have jumbo silver and black bobby pins. But they were cheap, so oh well.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my old 50&#x27;s style pin up hair projects. Love the plastic tub they came in, I won&#x27;t lose pins like that now :)</li>
    <li> They tear my hair out. They are painted black and the paint straps off as soon as it it worn, all over the place. Terrible.</li>
    <li> The only complaint I have is that they tend to pull hair out but they have a very secure hold.</li>
    <li> This pins are great! One pin holds my bra strap length hair securely. I&#x27;m thrilled I don&#x27;t have to use a bunch of small pins anymore. The curve fits my head nicely. There are flickers of black paint in the container. So the pins are a bit flaky, but I&#x27;ve yet to encounter any that haven&#x27;t done that. More likely it just from it being tossed around in the.container during shipping. At less than 5 bucks it a steal!</li>
    <li> My daughters loves these jumbo bob pins.  They do the job and I love the affordable price. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not completely sold on these hair pins but they do get the job done.  The two main reasons why I&#x27;m not in love with these hair pins is 1) the are very rigid and kind of hard to slide open, 2) when removing them they snap/snag my hair due to their rigid and inflexible nature/ their inability to easily open. However I do like how they are shaped. They curve of the pins complement the curve of the skull which makes them more easy to conceal/blend into the shape of ones head.</li>
    <li> I like the curve as it hugs my head and gives a more streamlined appearance. However, each pin has a chip in the paint at almost exactly the same spot. I&#x27;ve used them everyday for a week and the paint has started to peel. It has snagged a few hairs so be careful when you insert and remove the pins so you do&#x27;t break your hair unnecessarily.</li>
    <li> I only bought there because I needed something cheap to qualify for free shipping. Now I understand why they call these JUMBO pins! They&#x27;re very long and strangely curved, the kind of curve in no way that conforms to any part of a human body. However, I will keep them around just in case that I might turn into an eight foot big foot with unimaginably coarse long hair in my old age or I could fight off home burglars with these sharp steel instruments.</li>
    <li> These bobby pins are fine, but they seem like they have some sort of oil or grease from the manufacturing process on them. Not bad but they feel somewhat slick or oily. I had to wash them all, the residue also had an unpleasant smell which hasn&#x27;t disappeared completely yet. They do the job but I didn&#x27;t enjoy having to clean bobby pins before wearing them.</li>
    <li> The product came in the same packaging and is exactly as shown. There is a bit of material shavings at the bottom of the container, but these things work and hold my thick hair in all day without loosening.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the actual pins yet but when I received my box...it was all rattly and noisy when barely moved. I opened it and the bobby pins were all over the box. Not only that...the box wasn&#x27;t properly sealed so some were missing and I know they were missing because I counted them. Bummer. Hopefully the pins that remain work for me.</li>
    <li> The black coating chips and flakes off, and they aren&#x27;t comfortable to wear.  I use my teeth to pry them open like I think most of us do and end up with black specks in my teeth.  But they are so cheap, it&#x27;s not shocking.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gotten very hard to find these long pins in site store so was very excited to see them on Amazon for this price! They are a little curved so if that bothers you, these are not what you&#x27;re looking for. In my case, I needed something to keep my waist-length hair in a neat bun when I put it up and these do the job well! The plastic container they come in were an extra plus! These are so easy to lose in my hair drawer &amp; this keeps them nice and organized.</li>
    <li> The pins themselves work great, but the black paint that covers them chips off and gets all in my hair, face, and clothing.</li>
    <li> Nice, BIG bobby pins that come in a durable plastic storage box.  These are B-I-G and hold hair so good.  Nice tight hold, too.  The curve helps it to stay in your hair, and the metal is thick and nice.  Not like those new bobby pins that are so flimsy nowadays.</li>
    <li> Very strong bobby pins, they were larger than I expected but they hold so much better than the small ones!</li>
    <li> the pins were great for my child. she takes dance so they hold her hair really well and their great for buns.</li>
    <li> Love the length of these pins.</li>
    <li> I was excited to find these because I have very long hair but the pins chip within seconds of using them. They also twist when you try to insert them into your hair causing frustration. The tips also come off after one use. Not worth the money!</li>
    <li> Came in the mail the next day, they are perfect! Super sturdy and works well with holding my hair! Love!</li>
    <li> These things do not stay in place in your hair and when you pull them out they pinch the ends of your hair. I gave up trying to use them! Also, the black finish flakes off way too easily.</li>
    <li> I love these. They keep my hair in place without sticking out. Wish they were available as a single order and not just an add-on.</li>
    <li> The pait or whatever it is comes off of them. I&#x27;m growing out a pixie cut so they&#x27;re a little bit too bug for my hair right now but I think they still do what bobby pins are supposed to do. For the price that I got them I wouldn&#x27;t expect anything better</li>
    <li> Fantastic bobby pins! Yes, some paint is chipped off when they arrive. But so far they&#x27;re all still black and they all have the little rubber nubs to keep them from scratching your head. Even if all the paint chips off, the pin is hidden in my hair so not a real concern at this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are far more comfortable than the 3-inch straight pins I&#x27;ve used for years. They&#x27;ve been holding my hair great so far. I&#x27;m really happy with them, and for the price I&#x27;ll be stocking up.</li>
    <li> If you spray the pins with hairspray BEFORE you put them in your hair it will change your Life.</li>
    <li> These were bigger than I envisioned, but that&#x27;s my fault not the manufacturer&#x27;s. They&#x27;re great for holding back huge pieces of hair and are super tight (as in they don&#x27;t slip easily), which is great if you&#x27;re like me and can&#x27;t get most Bobby pins to stay in place. Be warned though: they tend to take a souvenir with them when you pull then out if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
    <li> Strong and works great. Holds my hair very well. Black paint is flaking off, but I&#x27;ll likely buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife and she loves them. Says the hold tightly and stay put, she even slept with them in her hair and the style stayed the whole night. Great deal!</li>
    <li> Loved these. They are a life saver</li>
    <li> I use these bobby pins every day.  I have fine hair and was worried at first that they would be too big, but they hold my hair in place perfectly and I like that they are larger as they keep sections of my hair perfectly in place without having to use a bunch of pins.  I noticed some black flecks on the bottom of the container when I received them, but the bobby pins look to be in perfect condition so I don&#x27;t really care about the flecks at all.  These have a nice, firm hold and I love the curved shape of the pins.  Highly recommend these, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Paint chips off. Smells like fresh paint when you open it. I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size so they&#x27;re too big. :/</li>
    <li> smells weirs but work good</li>
    <li> Product Arrived quickly like promised but only had 66 bobby pins instead of 80 like it clearly says it&#x27;s supposed to have .</li>
    <li> My daughter is in Irish dancer and we go through a lot of long pins to hold her wig on during her dance shows and competitions. These worked well at a great price.</li>
    <li> I like these a lot, they hold my longer hair better then the shorter ones. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the black paint occasionally comes off.</li>
    <li> Work great, the curve is nice, doesn&#x27;t give headaches like straight bobby pins.  Paint chips off easily though.</li>
    <li> I love the size and the curvature. Does a great job of keeping my hair in place. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the paint chips off.</li>
    <li> I like the size and length of this pin, but the paint came off big time when i received the item. A bit disappointed and gross out to see that.</li>
    <li> I have quite a bit of coarse wavy/curly hair that eats normal sized bobby pins, and breaks hair ties on a regular basis. These pins are beefy and large enough to work well in my hair. The curved design helps to hid the appearance of the pins in my hair, and so far I haven&#x27;t had any stretch and lose their shape on me.</li>
    <li> These are  great bobby pins to use for piling your hair on top of your head.  I have waist length hair and like to braid it and pin the braid on top of my head.  These bobby pins are big, comfortable and strong.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was very unhappy when I recieved this product. The paint was chipping and chips werected all over the container.</li>
    <li> The hair pins are covered in a cheap paint that chips off and into your hair when you try to use one. Also, the container has some of the chipped paint in it. Not a high-quality product.</li>
    <li> I bought these to have on hand for my wedding...unfortunately I apparently do not understand what 2.5&amp;#34; actually means when it comes to Bobbi Pins...nor apparently do I understand the term &amp;#34;Jumbo&amp;#34;.  I wanted something half this size and much lighter.  In case you are also a distracted bride, please note these are large.  That said, they are quite sturdy, come in a handy tub, and are indeed jumbo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got lots of giant hair and these are strong enough to hold it up.&lt;br /&gt;I mean they&#x27;re bobby pins, it&#x27;s kinda hard to mess that up.</li>
    <li> Pins are an excellent size for either long or short hair lengths. The curve of the pin makes it easier to hold your hair style.</li>
