### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This was a great find!</li>
      <li>Very Happy.</li>
      <li>It is very good for hair as it is made for.</li>
      <li>I loved them, I got a lot of complements!</li>
      <li>These clip ins are great and were a hit with my costume.</li>
      <li>It is light and the lights work perfectly.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my glow bday party, I used them as a diadem in my hair, if you want a great effect you would need more than one</li>
      <li>Very pleased.</li>
      <li>They add a nice touch to my glow costumes.</li>
      <li>These were quite fun and made great gifts.</li>
      <li>But probably better suited for a drunken night out with the girls.</li>
      <li>I found many uses for Halloween and Xmas.</li>
      <li>Ok, yes, they&#x27;re inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>It was supposed to be for the top student in the class</li>
      <li>I paid more for Glowbys and got the cheap dollar store knock offs.</li>
      <li>They are also easy to use.</li>
      <li>Easily clips in and stays put.</li>
      <li>Turned on the first of 3 I ordered and it lit nicely.</li>
      <li>Bright, clear bluish light with good-sized fibers.</li>
      <li>However I was sent a cheap knock off</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a cute idea and maybe for a one time party event would be fun, but I can&#x27;t see storing them.</li>
      <li>Opened up excited to use for a costume.</li>
      <li>These shipped quickly as well.</li>
      <li>We have a 3 year-old and were sure to keep these up high and out of reach when done with them.</li>
      <li>My daughter is into all sorts of fun things for her hair.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re not super, super bright but they were bright enough to be clearly seen and they made the girls look pretty cool!</li>
      <li>Shipped super fast.</li>
      <li>Who knows how many \\&quot;white\\&quot; items are actually colored?</li>
      <li>These are so pretty.  </li>
      <li>Pretty junky, I&#x27;d skip it.</li>
      <li>but honestly, was underwhelming compared to the other glowing/LED gadgets in the room.   </li>
      <li>Fun accessory for preteens &amp; older girls</li>
      <li>and they want something new &amp; fun to make the day a little more special.</li>
      <li>Enjoyed the product very much and was what I expected.</li>
      <li>is pretty cheap system I wish it was different.</li>
      <li>A little more difficult to hide than the picture suggests, but awesome anyway!</li>
      <li>The barrette is a tad big, and the metal seems like my hair may slip out of it, so you may need to constantly adjust it or clip it on with your own hair clips, etc.</li>
      <li>Will definitely order more in the future.</li>
      <li>She can wear it and bring in the new year with style.</li>
      <li>I bought this for New Years.  </li>
      <li>These went straight back to Amazon.</li>
      <li>Could not even open the barette...not a very sturdy product.</li>
      <li>the battery is kind of hard to hide and the hair is not that long.</li>
      <li>If you have toddlers in your home please be aware that these do have button cell batteries and in order to shut off the lights you must slide the back cover open thereby exposing the batteries.</li>
      <li>Was sent half of my package as ordered, however the white ones that I ordered came in off brand packaging, had a different barrette style than actual glowbys, were longer than real glowby&#x27;s AND to top it off they sent me the rainbow ones instead of the white ones!</li>
      <li>Too bad the optics are beautiful.</li>
      <li>The type used are not worth the cost when the item itself is more than half of one battery alone.</li>
      <li>But not for a kid, however could be good for crazy hair day at school.  </li>

<li> But not for a kid, however could be good for crazy hair day at school.  </li>
<li> My hair stylist used loose curls and pinned my hair half-up, and hid the clips within the pinned back hair.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d buy these again, especially for Halloween or other events where you want the kids visible</li>
<li> These were a big hit and helped us keep track of the girls in the dark as they ran around and played before the fireworks began.</li>
<li> The barrette clip is very hard to open/close, and is much bulkier and heavier than expected.  </li>
<li> I received one white and one green OFF BRAND.</li>
<li> not even 5 min later it was dead.</li>
<li> The other two, One worked for about 2 min</li>
<li> The other gadgets were cheaper too.</li>
<li> the other would not turn on no matter what.</li>
<li> Arrived quickly due to Amazon Prime.</li>
<li> In the lighting business, we call this \\&quot;rainbow stupidity,\\&quot; because white is classy, and rainbow is tasteless.</li>
<li> I would just say handle with care and try not to mess with unless moving in or out of hair.</li>
<li> I think came with dead batteries or old stale batteries.</li>
<li> Lasted a few nights use.</li>
<li> Dont waste your time.</li>
<li> The packages arrived on time, and their labels said \\&quot;white.\\&quot; Sadly, when I opened the packages, all of the LED modules turned out not to be white, but rainbow.</li>
<li> Works but hard to clip on.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m highly upset. :(</li>
<li> So dumb.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time buy them from [...]!!!</li>
<li> however they are really expensive .</li>
<li> Not impressed!</li>
<li> it is impossible to contact the seller.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fun accessory for preteens &amp; older girls w/ a lot of ego strength &amp; a sense of whimsy.</li>
    <li> Was sent half of my package as ordered, however the white ones that I ordered came in off brand packaging, had a different barrette style than actual glowbys, were longer than real glowby&#x27;s AND to top it off they sent me the rainbow ones instead of the white ones! Not impressed! it is impossible to contact the seller. Don&#x27;t waste your time buy them from [...]!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered several of these fiber optic effects in white. The packages arrived on time, and their labels said \\&quot;white.\\&quot; Sadly, when I opened the packages, all of the LED modules turned out not to be white, but rainbow. In the lighting business, we call this \\&quot;rainbow stupidity,\\&quot; because white is classy, and rainbow is tasteless. Obviously there was a mixup at the factory. Who knows how many \\&quot;white\\&quot; items are actually colored? Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> These clip ins are great and were a hit with my costume. They are also easy to use. I broke mine earlier in the night but I don&#x27;t think it malfunctioned. I would just say handle with care and try not to mess with unless moving in or out of hair.</li>
    <li> I bought the white optics for a glow party my students earned. It was supposed to be for the top student in the class but honestly, was underwhelming compared to the other glowing/LED gadgets in the room.   The other gadgets were cheaper too.</li>
    <li> These are so pretty.  Keep the plastic thing that goes between the batteries so you can turn them off.  The back broke off when I tried to take out the batteries.  Too bad the optics are beautiful.</li>
    <li> Ok, yes, they&#x27;re inexpensive.  I wish I would have noticed the color in the ad, didn&#x27;t want white.  Daughter didn&#x27;t mind the color, but she did mind them failing after 10 minutes of use.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my glow bday party, I used them as a diadem in my hair, if you want a great effect you would need more than one however they are really expensive . After the battery died it sucked because I could not find another one. The sticker that comes with it so you dont have to take off the battery is pretty cheap system I wish it was different. the battery is kind of hard to hide and the hair is not that long. maybe around 30 cms.</li>
    <li> Could not even open the barette...not a very sturdy product. Would not purchase again. Works but hard to clip on.</li>
    <li> I purchased two white Glowbys barrettes. I received one white and one green OFF BRAND. Totally different product. I paid more for Glowbys and got the cheap dollar store knock offs. I&#x27;m highly upset. :(</li>
    <li> Just putting the barrette together turns the system on, so don&#x27;t store with the battery in.</li>
    <li> These were advertised as Glowbys, and the package was pictured as &amp;#34;Glowby&amp;#34;.  However I was sent a cheap knock off which did not work well.  This is totally against Amazon.com policy and the product should be removed from the site. I would have given no stars but that does not work.</li>
    <li> This was ordered for NYE.  It is light and the lights work perfectly.  Will definitely order more in the future.</li>
    <li> Pretty junky, I&#x27;d skip it. Something that should sell in a dollar store.</li>
    <li> Shipped super fast. The barrette is a tad big, and the metal seems like my hair may slip out of it, so you may need to constantly adjust it or clip it on with your own hair clips, etc. All speculation as I have not worn them yet, but I have tried it on briefly. Looks just like the picture.</li>
    <li> I loved them, I got a lot of complements!</li>
    <li> My daughter is into all sorts of fun things for her hair.  I bought this for New Years.  She can wear it and bring in the new year with style.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my halloween costume. I got 2, one for each side of my hair. Easily clips in and stays put. Got lots of compliments. Lasted a few nights use. In the future, I would purchase 4 instead of 2.</li>
    <li> It was for a glow in the dak party and everyone commented on it.</li>
    <li> It is very good for hair as it is made for. But I wanted it for the purpose of decoration. So it is ok for me but not perfect</li>
    <li> I purchased four of these (two flashing red/blue and two flashing white) for both my daughter and my niece who attended 4th of July fireworks with us last night. These were a big hit and helped us keep track of the girls in the dark as they ran around and played before the fireworks began. They&#x27;re not super, super bright but they were bright enough to be clearly seen and they made the girls look pretty cool! I&#x27;d buy these again, especially for Halloween or other events where you want the kids visible and they want something new &amp; fun to make the day a little more special. These shipped quickly as well. Very pleased. If you have toddlers in your home please be aware that these do have button cell batteries and in order to shut off the lights you must slide the back cover open thereby exposing the batteries. We have a 3 year-old and were sure to keep these up high and out of reach when done with them.</li>
    <li> I wore two of these in my hair to my office Christmas party, and they were a hit! Bright, clear bluish light with good-sized fibers. My hair stylist used loose curls and pinned my hair half-up, and hid the clips within the pinned back hair. This was a great find!</li>
    <li> The barrette clip is very hard to open/close, and is much bulkier and heavier than expected.  The lights kept coming back on after I had put the glowby away, even though I left the battery compartment open.  It&#x27;s a cute idea and maybe for a one time party event would be fun, but I can&#x27;t see storing them.</li>
    <li> Enjoyed the product very much and was what I expected. I found many uses for Halloween and Xmas. Very Happy.</li>
    <li> So dumb.  Wanted it to work.  But not for a kid, however could be good for crazy hair day at school.  But probably better suited for a drunken night out with the girls.</li>
    <li> I used this accessory at various EDM festivals such as EDC Vegas, UMF, and Groove Cruise.  They add a nice touch to my glow costumes.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly due to Amazon Prime. Opened up excited to use for a costume. Turned on the first of 3 I ordered and it lit nicely. not even 5 min later it was dead. The other two, One worked for about 2 min the other would not turn on no matter what. I think came with dead batteries or old stale batteries. The type used are not worth the cost when the item itself is more than half of one battery alone. Dont waste your time. These went straight back to Amazon.</li>
    <li> These were quite fun and made great gifts.</li>
    <li> A little more difficult to hide than the picture suggests, but awesome anyway!</li>
