      <li>But it actually worked perfectly and the color started to come out in about 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>It gives my hair a nice shade of light brown/blonde.</li>
      <li>Results could have been better.</li>
      <li>Once again,the best product I have used in ten years.</li>
      <li>a nice effect of brown fading into a golden color.</li>
      <li>I decided that I wanted a nice blend from my medium brown to the blonde on the ends, so I applied at appropriate intervals and it came out amazingly.</li>
      <li>I also made sure the ends of my hair were super saturated.</li>
      <li>Just be smart, follow the instructions, and be kind to your locks.</li>

      <li>it gave me a light brownish color.</li>
      <li>but like I said before, it was pretty healthy to begin with.</li>

      <li>yes, it works amazing and people absolutely love my ombre color, but do prepared to sacrifice your health hair for the outside beauty.</li>
      <li>so you can work quickly to get the bleach in before it starts to dry, leaving you with more tangles and breakage the more you try to pull the brush through it.</li>

      <li>It was about $80 but worth EVERY penny.</li>
      <li>now more than a week later my hair is still soft, healthy and free of damage.</li>
      <li>lts worth to purchase, l just colored to make look like highlights  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Its definitely looks better with your hair curled, like a light wavy....</li>
      <li>, everything you need is right there in the box.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>Obviously you need to be careful about how and where you apply it to make sure the application remains consistent on both sides, and do some lighter brushing closer to the top to make sure you get that fade.</li>
      <li>story short, I think this look is okay.....</li>
      <li>I did the outer side first then went through the inner side to make sure it was all even &amp; coated.</li>
      <li>I did the ear to tips ombre the first time, and then re-did it because my hair had grown.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;i will say my first time, my hair did turn brassy copper color.&lt;br</li>
      <li>For the first time ever in ym life, my air fried...</li>
      <li>kit itself is pretty user-friendly.</li>
      <li>I got exactly what I wanted-</li>
      <li>You will also want to have a color safe deep conditioner on hand to sit on your hair after the process.</li>
      <li>I found a picture of how I wanted the final result to look- medium brown that would fade into a light golden color.</li>
      <li>It was burnt orange and my normally very healthy hair that lays down pretty flat and easily blow dries straight, was sticking out about 3 fried inches.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want it THAT bad that I was willing to shell out a ton of money to pay for it to get done in a salon, and I&#x27;m pretty good with my own hair</li>
      <li>SORRY, My hair did look fantastic and A LOT of guys liked it!  </li>
      <li>and it wasn&#x27;t a large section.</li>
      <li>I put it right on top of that orange mess....</li>
      <li>I started out the whole process by splitting my hair into two sections &amp; putting them into hair ties.</li>
      <li>but I do really like the way it turned out.</li>
      <li>bought this after much research.</li>
      <li>so I thought this would help me get the whole look...</li>
      <li>had unhealthy/dried out hair that just didn&#x27;t take to the bleach very well.</li>
      <li>had unhealthy/dried out hair that just didn&#x27;t take to the bleach very well.</li>
      <li>it is now much easier to get this look.  </li>
      <li>The subscription option is very convenient and affordable, so I will be re-coloring every six months.</li>
      <li>i bought a second box by accident and re did my color, and its a nice honey blonde.....</li>
      <li>like the way my hair looks, but I can see how this would be an issue with anyone who has any kind of dye in their hair, especially if it&#x27;s semi-permanent and they had it done in the last 6-9 months.</li>

      <li>To get the back of my hair, I pulled it forward (towards my face) &amp; brushed through &amp; made sure to keep the ombre level &amp; even.</li>
      <li>but now I have to work on getting my super long black hair healthy</li>
      <li>if you&#x27;re hair is dead on the ends its going to kill it even more.</li>
      <li>The last time I colored my hair (temporarily) was about 2 months ago with a demi-permanent dye that is about a shade darker and much more red than my natural color.</li>
      <li>I got it trimmed recently, so it was pretty healthy looking with only a few split ends right before I used this kit.</li>

      <li>I was just lucky enough to have the stars align with my current hair conditions, and the kit worked well with what I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>This was very unusual because I had long and wavy hair</li>
      <li>If I were to guess, most people who gave negative reviews or this product either 1. didn&#x27;t apply it correctly.</li>

      <li>either so do take caution because bleach &amp; stuff that harshly strips color from the hair is very powerful.</li>
      <li>The thing was, after a few months I started to realize that the bottom of my hair started to fade into light blonde and silver color.</li>
      <li>but I took on major damage.</li>
      <li>For only $10, I have fantastic color that has cost no less than $65 per process in the past at salons.</li>
      <li>, I would have to cut off a lot more than I would be able to handle (I am a long hair person and do not want short hair, was trying to grow out from bad hair cut).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really full proof and a huge money saver if you get crazy with the lightness you can always color over</li>
      <li>gave it four stars for a few minor reasons: because the gloves that came in the box were super flimsy, and because the bleach just didn&#x27;t work as well with my my darkest</li>

      <li>/&gt;I was concerned and super nervous about this, especially because of all the negative reviews, and because I&#x27;ve never seen what my hair looks like bleached before...</li>

<li> /&gt;Overall, I think this is a great kit as long as you are careful, don&#x27;t have a lot of previous dye jobs, remember to deep-condition your hair afterward, and are willing to tone your ends if you are unhappy with resulting color the bleach leaves behind.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I highlighted my hair 2-3 months ago and dyed it solid brown a month ago. I don&#x27;t think this product should be recommended for people who have dyed their hair or highlighted the hair before. I got strands with different tones even though I specifically evenly applied and saturated the strands as recommended. Also, it came out a nasty brassy copper color. Maybe it&#x27;s just my previous layers and layers of color. :( I&#x27;m going to have to chop off my hair and start over. But seriously, 13.99 or whatever I paid for this was a rip. they should say on the box not recommended for people with previous bleach jobs.</li>
    <li> Will definitely buy this again.. The only thing that i dont like is that  you still need to tone down the color after you wash it. Because i dont like the result its like color orange...</li>
    <li> I have black virgin hair, in the past it was really difficult to apply any color on my hair so I was doubtful. But it actually worked perfectly and the color started to come out in about 20 minutes. I was happy with the result and got many compliments. The thing was, after a few months I started to realize that the bottom of my hair started to fade into light blonde and silver color. Aft 3 moths I noticed that my hair had a lot of split ends and it became so frizzy, it was hard to style my hair than usual. This was very unusual because I had long and wavy hair and I used hot flat iron a lot, but I never had any split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 months later, I cut off about 2 inches of my hair and expected the split ends would be gone. Nope. 8 months later, I cut off another 2 inches of my hair... nope. Around 12 months I decided to cut off to shoulder length from my chest, my stylist believed that should do the trick. Guess what, 14 months now and ... I still have split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, it works amazing and people absolutely love my ombre color, but do prepared to sacrifice your health hair for the outside beauty.</li>
    <li> I bit hard to use.  Results could have been better.</li>
    <li> So my hair is black and has been this way for YEARS! I only touch up my roots not my ends... I have no need to since I have been coloring it black since I was 16, now 24.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this after much research. I was told it would work on my color treated hair and that because I had not colored my ends in year that this would work.&lt;br /&gt;WRONG&lt;br /&gt;It did nothing to my hair but dry it out.&lt;br /&gt;I called loreal and I am getting a refund but now I have to work on getting my super long black hair healthy again!&lt;br /&gt;SUCH A PAIN! Wish it worked though! It&#x27;s a great look</li>
    <li> I have jet black hair and had a professional ombre done. This is a HORRIBLE imitation. My hair turned brassy orange and the ends were beyond dry. I had to dye everything black all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Streaks does not equal ombre. Just invest in professional ombre.</li>
    <li> i wish i would have left it on longer. I left it on for like a half hour and its barely noticeable but its blonder. not like bleach blonde though so i use blonde shampoo now and it has helped it. i will be dying it again though.&lt;br /&gt;also if you&#x27;re hair is dead on the ends its going to kill it even more.</li>
    <li> if you have moderatly dark brown hair, this product WILL NOT WORK! I have bleached my hair to blonde, and for pre lightening to apply colored dyes, this product was patchy and did not lift the color of a majority of the area. would NEVER buy again, and would not even wish this on a frenemy,</li>
    <li> I had virgin dark brown natural african american hair and by using the instructions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; I got minimal color change and extreme dryness that led to a complete break off of my ends. My hair lifted maybe 1-2 shades which could only be seen in the sunlight. I left it on for the recommended amount of time. Even after proper hair care (deep conditioning, moisturizing, etc) my hair began to break off at the meeting point of where the color stopped. I had arm pit length hair to begin with and was left (3 months later) with shoulder length hair. For my kinky curly sisters: Don&#x27;t chance it!</li>
    <li> This is a awesome product. I did an ombré effect but also it&#x27;s the best highlighting kit if you don&#x27;t want to do that. I have had color specialists comment on my hair. It&#x27;s really full proof and a huge money saver if you get crazy with the lightness you can always color over and it looks even better. Once again,the best product I have used in ten years. Please don&#x27;t discontinue.</li>
    <li> I read up on this before buying it from my local CVS. I had been wanting to go ombre for a while and this is one of the only kits could find. I didn&#x27;t want it THAT bad that I was willing to shell out a ton of money to pay for it to get done in a salon, and I&#x27;m pretty good with my own hair so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium/dark brown, which I&#x27;ve never bleached, highlighted or dyed (beyond demi-permanents that only slightly alter my color). I got it trimmed recently, so it was pretty healthy looking with only a few split ends right before I used this kit. I have very thick hair, and the bottom layers are especially dark. I do like the color of my hair, so I figured with the color being stripped down and lightened... how bad could it actually be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned and super nervous about this, especially because of all the negative reviews, and because I&#x27;ve never seen what my hair looks like bleached before... but I do really like the way it turned out. The last time I colored my hair (temporarily) was about 2 months ago with a demi-permanent dye that is about a shade darker and much more red than my natural color. I thought that they dye had entirely washed from my hair by now, but I could see some strawberry pigment after I used this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit itself is pretty user-friendly. I was actually very surprised with how well the brush worked with achieving the gradient look rather than the &amp;#34;oh man, girlfriend has some SUPER bad roots, she should get that fixed&amp;#34; look. Obviously you need to be careful about how and where you apply it to make sure the application remains consistent on both sides, and do some lighter brushing closer to the top to make sure you get that fade. I also made sure the ends of my hair were super saturated. I would recommend starting with the darkest part of your hair (so that develops for the longest time) and ending with the lightest parts (so that develops for the least amount of time). You also have to be careful about over-brushing with the brush in the kit, and apply the bleach quickly. If the bleach starts to dry, you&#x27;re going to have to yank through the strands, and yes, the bleach COULD damage your hair. That&#x27;s the nature of the chemical. Stick to very small sections of hair (3-inch sections max) so you can work quickly to get the bleach in before it starts to dry, leaving you with more tangles and breakage the more you try to pull the brush through it. I stuck to the 45 mins MAX total time (per the included instructions), and my hair does not look unhealthy, fried, dry, etc., but like I said before, it was pretty healthy to begin with. I showered immediately after and let my conditioner sit in for a solid amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way my hair looks, but I can see how this would be an issue with anyone who has any kind of dye in their hair, especially if it&#x27;s semi-permanent and they had it done in the last 6-9 months. If I were to guess, most people who gave negative reviews or this product either 1. didn&#x27;t apply it correctly. 2. didn&#x27;t let it process for the correct amount of time, 3. didn&#x27;t like the color of their hair once bleach was applied, 4. had colored their hair recently enough that it would affect it, or 5. had unhealthy/dried out hair that just didn&#x27;t take to the bleach very well. I was just lucky enough to have the stars align with my current hair conditions, and the kit worked well with what I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars for a few minor reasons: because the gloves that came in the box were super flimsy, and because the bleach just didn&#x27;t work as well with my my darkest hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a great kit as long as you are careful, don&#x27;t have a lot of previous dye jobs, remember to deep-condition your hair afterward, and are willing to tone your ends if you are unhappy with resulting color the bleach leaves behind. Just be smart, follow the instructions, and be kind to your locks. Good luck!have to be careful about over-brushing with the brush in the kit, and apply the bleach quickly. If the bleach starts to dry, you&#x27;re going to have to yank through the strands, and yes, the bleach COULD damage your hair. That&#x27;s the nature of the chemical. Stick to very small sections of hair (3-inch sections max) so you can work quickly to get the bleach in before it starts to dry, leaving you with more tangles and breakage the more you try to pull the brush through it.

    <li> Okay so for O60- This will be a bit lengthy as to describe specifics, the process, results, etc- I have been wanting to ombre my hair for a while now but didn&#x27;t wanna do it myself in fear of ruining it. However I thought about it &amp; ended up grabbing a clearanced box at work (Walmart) for $7.00. I found a picture of how I wanted the final result to look- medium brown that would fade into a light golden color. For those who don&#x27;t know how this product works, you basically mix the stuff (the instructions in the box will walk you through it step by step), squirt the mixed product onto a little brush, then brush through where you want it to ombre at. Now, if you have short hair, I&#x27;d recommend having a friend or someone help because you could accidentally make it come out uneven. I have long hair with layers. I started out the whole process by splitting my hair into two sections &amp; putting them into hair ties. I undid one, prepared the product, then started applying (brushing) from all the hair under my chin down to my ends. I did the outer side first then went through the inner side to make sure it was all even &amp; coated. After finishing I repeated to the other side. To get the back of my hair, I pulled it forward (towards my face) &amp; brushed through &amp; made sure to keep the ombre level &amp; even. After both sides were done, I wrapped the two big sections in foil and used my blow dryer to speed up the lightening process. In total I think I took about 45 mins. The end result picture(s) will be posted with this. I got exactly what I wanted- a nice effect of brown fading into a golden color. Now, it does use a lightening powder. But even then it might not lift black or other very dark colors in one try. You don&#x27;t wanna over-process your hair either so do take caution because bleach &amp; stuff that harshly strips color from the hair is very powerful. My hair used to be black but I had a salon do an &amp;#34;all over head cap lightening&amp;#34; process. It was about $80 but worth EVERY penny. I got sick &amp; tired of bland black hair so now my hair is, well, see the pics! Anyways, I don&#x27;t know about the rest of the ombre colors, but O60 came out amazing! I will continue to use it over &amp; over again. (: Good luck to people who wanna change up the hair!I got sick &amp; tired of bland black hair so now my hair is, well, see the pics!

    <li> The Ombre Feria 060, is awesome. lts worth to purchase, l just colored to make look like highlights  and yes l am happy with the results. l give it a 10 scale 1-10</li>
    <li> I like this color. It gives my hair a nice shade of light brown/blonde.</li>
    <li> I used this to remove black hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;I had my hair previously dyed black and wanted to lighten it to dye it red.&lt;br /&gt;So I used this all over my hair it gave me a light brownish color. So I went ahead and dyed my hair red.not a trace of black was left over&lt;br /&gt;I wish it was a little bit cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I tried Revlon&#x27;s Frost and Glow highlighting kit because it was cheaper.Bigggg mistake.it left my hair string like, it began to break off.my hair is shorter because of that.Never again.</li>
    <li> I saw this product had mixed reviews but really wanted to try it. I have dark brown hair and usually do not lighten my hair. I recently had added a few highlights from a store bought kit, to the bottom and they came out a pretty carmel color so I thought this would help me get the whole look...now I know I had highlighted some of my hair but it seemed I had waited long enough and it wasn&#x27;t a large section. When I was younger I used to do all types of funky coloring things so though this would work. For the first time ever in ym life, my air fried...I mean FRIED!!! It was burnt orange and my normally very healthy hair that lays down pretty flat and easily blow dries straight, was sticking out about 3 fried inches. I now know the definition of frying your hair!!!! Thank goodness I had a box of dark dye, I had no choice...I put it right on top of that orange mess....it was so, so bad...I had too. Came out, my hair did not fall off but I took on major damage. That night I slept in conditioner and have slept in conditioner and oil many times since. I went to have an inch cut off and was told to cut off all damage, I would have to cut off a lot more than I would be able to handle (I am a long hair person and do not want short hair, was trying to grow out from bad hair cut). So now I will have to just keep going in to have a little trimmed here and there. I saw some mixed reviews but usualy when I take my chances with hair products, it works out...if it doesn&#x27;t it&#x27;s not a major mistake. This was! The box reccomends for virgin hair, maybe for virgin hair it would be okay. I also did leave on a little extra for proccessing, because it seemed the color was not lifting. I had done this before with no issues, but this time, no way! Wish I never tried!</li>
    <li> Back in the day, I would have seen a girl with her hair like this and thought she needed to do her roots.  However, I had gotten sick of my plain dark brown hair and wanted something new.  I saw this at Target and went for it.  I have actually tried before with highlighting kits to do this but thanks to the Feria brush it is now much easier to get this look.  My hair at this time is shoulder length and I took the brush and bleach and at chin level created a new look.  It is really cute!  I curled the ends and can&#x27;t wait to premier it.  If it gets accolades, I will update this review!!!  LOVE IT...In case my low votes are due to my lack of editing...SORRY, My hair did look fantastic and A LOT of guys liked it!  I have used this again and again.</li>
    <li> I like the ombre look. So i decided to try this after all of the tutorials Ive watched.&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I think this look is okay.....&lt;br /&gt;Its definitely looks better with your hair curled, like a light wavy....&lt;br /&gt;But thats just my opinion....&lt;br /&gt;Its a very nice product, everything you need is right there in the box.&lt;br /&gt;You can achieve any look with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will say my first time, my hair did turn brassy copper color.&lt;br /&gt;But i bought a second box by accident and re did my color, and its a nice honey blonde.....</li>
    <li> I have now purchased and used this kit twice (with about 5 months in between applications) and I&#x27;m in love.  I did the ear to tips ombre the first time, and then re-did it because my hair had grown.  For retouching it up, you may want a friend to help you out and be the eyes in the back of your head so you don&#x27;t over process the parts that were already colored (unless that&#x27;s what you want). As a tip, please read up on the process and watch plenty of YouTube videos before using this kit! And have a plan. A lot of the negative reviews are due to users not having a plan and either damaging their hair or just not getting the results that they wanted.  I decided that I wanted a nice blend from my medium brown to the blonde on the ends, so I applied at appropriate intervals and it came out amazingly. For only $10, I have fantastic color that has cost no less than $65 per process in the past at salons. You will also want to have a color safe deep conditioner on hand to sit on your hair after the process. I did this and now more than a week later my hair is still soft, healthy and free of damage. The subscription option is very convenient and affordable, so I will be re-coloring every six months. Enjoy!</li>
