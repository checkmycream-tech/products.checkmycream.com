      <li>Amazingly this works for me.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
      <li>But, it still works effectively regardless.</li>
      <li>shampoo lathered well for me and seems to have treated both my hair and my skin kindly.  </li>
      <li>and I can honestly say it works just as well as Nizoral.</li>
      <li>good product, wish I could find it more affordably.</li>
      <li>so that was a nice bonus, overall I&#x27;m very happy to have found an acceptable replacement for Nizoral.</li>
      <li>The packaging  (bottle and pump)  showed some pride in the product ans was a great first impression.</li>
      <li>; you&#x27;re much better off without it.</li>
      <li>It helps with itching / flaking and leaves my hair looking much better than Nizoral ever did.</li>
      <li>I love the pump bottle.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell fruity like most shampoos out there.</li>
      <li>Nizoral worked for me because of the ingredient ketoconazole, however Nizoral is selling for like $100+ a bottle because Johnson and Johnson is on hold of producing more..</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>Lo and behold, I discovered that many medicated pet shampoos have ketoconazole.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to take the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t be sure that this is what is doing it rather than the added biotin supplements and an increase in protein and nutrients in my diet.</li>
      <li>Love the pump.</li>
      <li>My favorite shampoo bar none.</li>
      <li>Four stars, mostly on quality.</li>
      <li>For the price, it&#x27;s still an okay value, and until I find something better</li>
      <li>I may start hoarding it, just to be sure.</li>
      <li>I find that I need to use 3x as much or more to cover my scalp.</li>
      <li>The Nizoral was suggested by my Doctor and this shampoo handled the problem better than Nizoral did,  </li>
      <li>I have to say that this works even better than the Nizoral for my husband.</li>
      <li>Finally a fabulous organic shampoo that has cured my scalp issues!</li>
      <li>Love the peppermint scent.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff</li>
      <li>It has worked great so far.  </li>
      <li>and it leaves my hair feeling great; soft and easy to style, not like straw.</li>
      <li>Easy 5/5.</li>
      <li>It works great and does not dry up your hair like Nizoral does.  </li>
      <li>I have suffered from seborrheic dermatitis in my scalp for years and this shampoo has giving me the best results ever, I can wear black shirts</li>
      <li>The smell is overall pleasant and not to strong.</li>
      <li>The product did clean my hair well, but it did not relieve any of the itching.</li>
      <li>With the pump bottle I find I&#x27;m using 6-8 pumps of shampoo to clean my scalp.</li>
      <li>I use one pump to pre clean my hair and then rinse and repeat with another pump to let it sit and work its way in to my scalp.</li>
      <li>They also come in conditioning formulas, various pleasant scents (GNC has one that is lavender).  </li>
      <li>I have to use 6 pumps to get a really good lather on my scalp, but that really isn&#x27;t that much shampoo for the size of the bottle.</li>
      <li>it managed the itching a lot, specially when showering at night before bed</li>
      <li>/&gt;Everyone&#x27;s saying to dab on a lot, and it&#x27;s true.</li>
      <li>I have a problem with scalp flake and itch that is getting more intense and is not helped by pyrithione zinc or selenium sulfide shampoos.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is also quite gentle on the face, so people who suffer from occasional seborrheic dermatitis or an overly itchy beard, this stuff works great there as well.</li>
      <li>It was just more convenient to be able to pick up Nizoral OTC, but now that it&#x27;s unavailable I&#x27;ll have to go back to getting my prescriptions refilled.</li>
      <li>I have tried endless shampoos and products and this is by far the best!!</li>
      <li>This is a very well-made product and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>Makes it easy to know just how much I need to use.</li>
      <li>Received exactly as specified!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Quite pricey but honestly worth it if it continues to do the job.</li>
      <li>With Nizoral 1% unavailable right now I came to amazon for alternatives.</li>
      <li>now I don&#x27;t have to worry about the white dust in my shoulders,it takes like two washes to start seeing results and it has a pleasant smell, and I would buy it again.a update I bought this shampoo in October and for the first time I have used all of it and order me a new one it&#x27;s worth it .</li>
      <li>Even if I go several washings without using it and notice some dandruff again, it is not nearly as bad and much more manageable.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair very shiny and full.</li>
      <li>He no longer has any flaking and this product is very gentle on the hair.</li>
      <li>I took a chance on this one because it has the double hammer of pyrithione zinc and ketoconazole, and I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
      <li>/&gt;NIZORAL is back on shelves, I&#x27;d buy it until more is known about L&#x27;Marie.</li>
      <li>My dandruff is gone after the first application.  </li>
      <li>not itching after first use</li>
      <li>Seems to last a couple days at most before I must use the product again.</li>
      <li>Nizoral seemed to last up to a week or more at times before I felt like my scalp needed treatment.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>The one qualm I have with it is that it doesn&#x27;t lather very well at all, so it does take more to properly apply than you&#x27;d first anticipate.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather up quite as nice, as some other people have said, but it gets the job done.</li>
      <li>leave my hair clean and soft</li>
      <li>Compared to coal-tar shampoos, it also smells better and doesn&#x27;t dry out</li>
      <li>I had dry scalp and flakes for more than 5 years.</li>
      <li>He washes his hair with Dandruff Shampoo every other day and washes his face and body with Pure Castile soap, for a complete treatment and says to be very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery&lt;</li>
      <li>Leaves hair feeling clean and not dry.</li>
      <li>I have a real doubt about the hair loss prevention claim but this product feels like it has quality ingredients and handles the medication aspect so well</li>
      <li>I used the whole bottle, my scalp cleared up 100%</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say anything about the hair loss, since I don&#x27;t really have that problem.</li>
      <li>as much cause</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather much so</li>
      <li>/&gt;The product was delivered promptly and packed well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making this available, sorry about the fair review.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what other reviewers are talking about having to use more shampoo than they are used to using.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Hi All,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We started using below products from last couple of weeks, please find my review comments below:-&lt;br /&gt; After using Hair Growth Treatment Shampoo and Re-Energize Drops, it’s started itching and skin allergy on scalp.&lt;br /&gt; So I stopped using this products, it’s seems these are not functioning as for description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are Very bad products for me, because these didn’t controlled dandruff</li>
    <li> I just purchased this a few weeks ago to see if it would be as effective as Nizoral for less money.  It has worked great so far.  No issues with lathering, and I live in \\&quot;hard water\\&quot; area.  I took the advice of another reviewer, and I shampoo with a regular shampoo first then use this.  Will be purchasing again, especially since it seems the Nizoral 1% OTC may be discontinued indefinitely.</li>
    <li> Sodium l. sulfate (2X)--hard on hair; you&#x27;re much better off without it. At least it&#x27;s cheap to make (and the profit margin is therefore HUGE).</li>
    <li> After reading a review regarding this product not lathering well, I almost didn&#x27;t buy it.  I&#x27;m glad I decided to take the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo lathered well for me and seems to have treated both my hair and my skin kindly.  The Nizoral was suggested by my Doctor and this shampoo handled the problem better than Nizoral did,  I do find the odd \\&quot;pepperminty\\&quot; smell less than optimal, but the shampoo worked well enough to make that a non-problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have one unpleasant surprise.  The person who shipped it left the open/close top set to open and shampoo drooled out during shipping.  Which meant the shampoo got all over the bottle during shipping and all over my hands upon opening.  No big deal, but if that were to happen again, I&#x27;d start purchasing something else, somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intend to buy it again, because it worked so well and the price is about what I was paying for Nizoral.  I have no problem suggesting it to anyone else looking for a Nizoral replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: A poster asked about the company and who ensured product quality.  I went looking.  As far as I can tell, no one does.  The manufacturer is impossible to reach on-line.  Check out [...] to see just how hard they are to reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NIZORAL is back on shelves, I&#x27;d buy it until more is known about L&#x27;Marie.</li>
    <li> If you have psoriasis, you already know that a product that works well for someone else might work well for you, too -- or maybe not. In other words, all products are a crapshoot. I took a chance on this one because it has the double hammer of pyrithione zinc and ketoconazole, and I&#x27;m glad that I did. I get results comparable to what I had with prescription ketoconazole. Compared to coal-tar shampoos, it also smells better and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any lathering problems, but my softened water might have something to do with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
    <li> Seems to last a couple days at most before I must use the product again. Nizoral seemed to last up to a week or more at times before I felt like my scalp needed treatment. Also, the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather as well and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair manageable. IT IS THE BEST ALTERNATIVE to nizoral but I&#x27;m going to search out another product with the same anti-dandruff ingredient.</li>
    <li> Like many out there who use Nizoral, I have been desperate for a product that works similar to it.  I tried Denorex, T-gel - all of them with no luck, and found this product, and, in desperation, decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first wash, I could tell a difference, and it was for the better, not for the worst, as seemed to happen with the other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do agree with the other writers that this is a very thin product, and you have to use a bit more of it than you do with Nizoral, but for me, until Nizoral comes back on the market, I will be using this product.</li>
    <li> My wife has psoriasis on her scalp, so we grabbed this to give it a shot.  She uses it about once a week now and has no issues.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with scalp flake and itch that is getting more intense and is not helped by pyrithione zinc or selenium sulfide shampoos.  I wanted to try a shampoo with ketoconazale but reviewers say Nizoral is no longer on store shelves.  Lo and behold, I discovered that many medicated pet shampoos have ketoconazole.  I&#x27;m going to give them a try.  Pet shampoos now days are as high a quality as human shampoos and much less costly ounce per ounce.  They also come in conditioning formulas, various pleasant scents (GNC has one that is lavender).  What have I got to lose?</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this as a dandruff shampoo instead of Nizoral, which is usually very difficult to find.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly. I had dry scalp and flakes for more than 5 years. I went to see dermatologist and Tried all kinds of Dandruff shampoos on the market (H&amp;S, Selsun blue, tea leave, orange oil and Tar based etc...) None of them worked! I was told it was stress related, nothing will work on me. Until I tried L&#x27;emarie. After only 1 week, my dandruff was gone and no more flakes, no more itchy scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very bad product. Never use it. No effect on my dandruff. It gettig increase after use of it. Please do not buy..</li>
    <li> Love! This product worked GREAT for my seborrheic dermatitis (PCOS girls, this is your dream shampoo). I used the whole bottle, my scalp cleared up 100% and I have not had to buy anymore nearly 6 months later.</li>
    <li> I found this while I was looking for a replacement for Nizoral AD as it shares the active ingredient (ketoconazole) that I was looking for to tame my crazy dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works just as well as Nizoral AD and has a pleasant scent. The one qualm I have with it is that it doesn&#x27;t lather very well at all, so it does take more to properly apply than you&#x27;d first anticipate. This is the only reason I rated it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also quite gentle on the face, so people who suffer from occasional seborrheic dermatitis or an overly itchy beard, this stuff works great there as well.</li>
    <li> I have terrible, horrible, maddening seborrheic dermatitis, and I&#x27;ve been buying tiny bottles of Nizoral (in which Ketoconazole is the active ingredient) and having them shipped from Britain, because they stopped making it in the US.  Nizoral was the only thing that really worked, and then my source dried up and I had to seek an alternative solution.  I am SO GLAD I did!  This stuff is amazing.  Most products that treat &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; have a single active ingredient--this has several, as well as herbal/holistic ingredients.  For the Nizoral to be effective when I had a bad s.d. flare, I would have to apply it to my scalp wrap up my head and leave it on overnight at least twice.  This stuff, on the other hand, cleared up my scalp in one application, left on for about five minutes before rinsing.  I never want to be without it.  I may start hoarding it, just to be sure.</li>
    <li> This is a very well-made product and is easy to use. It seems to do the job and I will update as needed. Nice pump container and great pricing. I recommend, will buy again, and I hope this helps someone.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery&lt;br /&gt;My son is using it and waiting for the result</li>
    <li> Finally a fabulous organic shampoo that has cured my scalp issues! Smells amazing! Leaves my hair very shiny and full. I have tried endless shampoos and products and this is by far the best!!</li>
    <li> I like the combination of herbs and oils and dandruff fighting medications.  Great shampoo for all types of hair and hair styles.</li>
    <li> The product did clean my hair well, but it did not relieve any of the itching. The dandruff was not as visible as in the past.  My sister used the shampoo and loved it.  I guess I&#x27;ll just go back to the doc for a prescription.  It was just more convenient to be able to pick up Nizoral OTC, but now that it&#x27;s unavailable I&#x27;ll have to go back to getting my prescriptions refilled.</li>
    <li> As many others have likely noted, little lather. Doesn&#x27;t seem to make any difference in managing the eczema, so why not use something comparable that&#x27;s less expensive?</li>
    <li> A nizoral fan here, searching for a replacement. This got my attention with the essential oils stuff... I said, well... that could do wonders with my hair... wrong!!! every time I use this shampoo my hair has a lot of frizze. That never happened with nizoral. And with nizoral, the effect could last almost a week... This one, 2 days max. And my scalp feels very sensitive... I will keep trying, but I think this is not the winner...</li>
    <li> Best dandruff shampoo ever.  I&#x27;ve used just about all of them and this is the most effective and also smells great.  Easy 5/5.</li>
    <li> This product was for my son who still is still at the verge of his hormonal imbalance, experiencing excessive oil in face and head and losing hair. He washes his hair with Dandruff Shampoo every other day and washes his face and body with Pure Castile soap, for a complete treatment and says to be very pleased with the results. No dandruff or irritated skin after washing his hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what other reviewers are talking about having to use more shampoo than they are used to using.  It cleans my hair every bit as well as Redken, and kills the itch I&#x27;ve been having for months.  Love this stuff and it leaves my hair feeling great; soft and easy to style, not like straw.</li>
    <li> hair and scalp say thankyou</li>
    <li> It did not work on my hair</li>
    <li> I have suffered from dandruff for years and have never found anything that worked as well as Nizoral. After it was taken off the shelves, I went on yet another hunt for a product that would subside my dandruff. I tried several other products before finally just searching for the active ingredients in my prized shampoo and found this. I have been using it for several months now and I can honestly say it works just as well as Nizoral. It doesn&#x27;t lather up quite as nice, as some other people have said, but it gets the job done. I use it about every other hair washing, since I only wash my hair about 3x a week, and my dandruff is back under control. Even if I go several washings without using it and notice some dandruff again, it is not nearly as bad and much more manageable. I love the pump bottle. Makes it easy to know just how much I need to use. I have to use 6 pumps to get a really good lather on my scalp, but that really isn&#x27;t that much shampoo for the size of the bottle. Please never stop selling this product or I will be one very sad girl. Will definitely be buying this again once I run low.</li>
    <li> Best/Cheapest dandruff shampoo. Love the pump.</li>
    <li> I had problems with dandruff in the past, until I used this product. I was a big Head and Shoulders guy for the longest time, but this works so much faster. It&#x27;s amazing how I didn&#x27;t pick this up before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s saying to dab on a lot, and it&#x27;s true. You do need a lot to put through your hair. But, it still works effectively regardless. Take a look if you need help with dandruff.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have to wash my body with dandruff shampoo to keep my tinea versicolor down. If you’re not sure what that is, it’s basically a fungal infection with no real implications, except the fact that it looks unappealing. There are prescription medications for it, but ever since I was a teen my doctor has always recommended any type of dandruff shampoo. If I use head and shoulders, the rash will go away within about 10 days, but when I use l’emarie, it goes away within 4-5. I really couldn’t tell you as to why my condition goes away any sooner, but if you’re using dandruff shampoos to treat tinea or other similar rashes/infections, you might want to give this a try.</li>
    <li> Amazingly this works for me. It actually gets rid of my dandruff something I did not think was possible.&lt;br /&gt;I do need to use twice weekly to keep the dandruff away and others mention, it is a little weak shampoo wise. I use one pump to pre clean my hair and then rinse and repeat with another pump to let it sit and work its way in to my scalp. I could use another shampoo to accomplish this and save myself $$$. I use a apple cider vinegar rinse afterward for conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite pricey but honestly worth it if it continues to do the job.</li>
    <li> I used Nizoral to help with hair loss and side effects of Rogaine. The combination worked well for me over the past decade, but after Nizoral vanished from store shelves I found this product through a long / frustrating search.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it roughly (2.5 times per week) for past several months and I love it.  It helps with itching / flaking and leaves my hair looking much better than Nizoral ever did. It also provided the same affect as Nizoral - which is the only reason I use these products - less hair loss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the volume required to wash your hair, some commenters are complaining, but given the price of this product it&#x27;s equal in cost per wash to Nizoral of years past, and by comparison to today&#x27;s inflated price of Nizoral it&#x27;s a screaming bargain.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write a review but, I feel that I have to say something about this product. I have been longtime sufferer of Seborrheic Dermatitis. When I flare up it is usually more than just my scalp that suffers. My ears, eyebrows, and beard all will go crazy with dead skin. It has always been something that I have been embarrassed and self conscious about. I have been to dermatologists and had prescription shampoos, I have also tried what has seemed like every shampoo on the market that claims to relieve dandruff. All have seemed to work for a little bit, but nothing has ever completely cleared me up. I decided to try this based off of another review. I was in the middle of a bad flare-up and I used it about three times a week and two weeks later I was completely clear. I know only use it about once a week and for the last two months I have been completely clear. NOTHING HAS EVER HELPED AS GOOD AS THIS PRODUCT HAS. I&#x27;m not a doctor so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;ll work for everyone, but for someone who has been diagnosed with Seborrheic Dermatitis it has been a miracle. Can&#x27;t say anything about the hair loss, since I don&#x27;t really have that problem.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t attest to the effects on hair loss as I am doing everything under the sun to try and stop mine. I can&#x27;t be sure that this is what is doing it rather than the added biotin supplements and an increase in protein and nutrients in my diet. The fact is that my hair is no longer falling out and I believe this has helped it. What I can attest to with certainty when it comes to the efficacy of this product is that my dandruff is gone. No flakes, no itching, and it makes my hair softer rather than drying it out like other dandruff shampoos. I feel like I have tried pretty much everything out there over the last fifteen years, although I know that is an exaggeration. Having tried over the course of time at least 20 different solutions ranging from typical drug store brands (nizoral, nuetrogena t-gel, head and shoulders, ect) to several less chemically options (like mineral fusion dandruff shampoo, which incidentally does nothing for me), none have approached the results I have gotten from this (some helped temporarily, but none cleared it up entirely) and none have made my hair as happy as my scalp. I am sold on this one 100%. The four stars is because I suppose I would need to be certain it was what was stopping my hair from falling out at such a high rate in order to give it the five stars</li>
    <li> So far I like this shampoo, my first wash and I can feel the difference and the relief I feel . I used other shampoo with Ketoconazole and decided to buy this one because of the combination with the Pyrithione Zinc .</li>
    <li> With Nizoral off the shelves, I had been using a common brand \\&quot;dandruff\\&quot; shampoo (which does nothing), but within a month or so of finishing the remaining Nizoral I found my dandruff returning.  Looking up Nizoral or Ketoconazole shampoo on Amazon or Google brought up some laughable prices for Nizoral or other similar shampoos; then there was this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical, but this shampoo does the same great work that Nizoral does.  It is a little bit strong smelling, but the smell is fruity and not at all unpleasant; nothing like T-Gel or other tar-like shampoos.  It doesn&#x27;t lather much so you have to use quite a bit, but considering the price of the alternatives I&#x27;ll take this any day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a regular thing, but bought two bottles from Amazon and got a discount so that was a nice bonus, overall I&#x27;m very happy to have found an acceptable replacement for Nizoral.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product for my husband who deals with seborrheic dermatitis  because Nizoral was near impossible find in stores or online. I have to say that this works even better than the Nizoral for my husband. He no longer has any flaking and this product is very gentle on the hair. It does not dry his hair out. With all that said, an unexpected advantage is the condition is not only on his scalp but also on his face and this product also has removed all traces of it. If you suffer from seborrheic dermatitis then I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The packaging  (bottle and pump)  showed some pride in the product ans was a great first impression. I have a real doubt about the hair loss prevention claim but this product feels like it has quality ingredients and handles the medication aspect so well, you will think you are using a normal shampoo. Get glasses and read the instructions as someone who used this had a minor bad result. It was their fault, the stuff is NOT toxic or prone to bad interactions as far as I know. Four stars, mostly on quality.</li>
    <li> No more white flake,it work very good ,I would recommend it to people have the same trouble with the itchy  flaky on hair</li>
    <li> It works great and does not dry up your hair like Nizoral does.  For those with oily hair like mine, use a regular shampoo first to wash up excess oil, then use a bit of this shampoo for it&#x27;s effect on your scalp condition.  It is great!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling clean and not dry. One of the best shampoos I ever bought. Doesn&#x27;t smell fruity like most shampoos out there.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I think my hair is thicker after using it. I would give it 5 stars except 1) it has SLS as one of the main ingredients and 2) it&#x27;s really expensive. Probably won&#x27;t buy again, though it was neat to try.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from seborrheic dermatitis in my scalp for years and this shampoo has giving me the best results ever, I can wear black shirts now I don&#x27;t have to worry about the white dust in my shoulders,it takes like two washes to start seeing results and it has a pleasant smell, and I would buy it again.a update I bought this shampoo in October and for the first time I have used all of it and order me a new one it&#x27;s worth it .</li>
    <li> good product, wish I could find it more affordably.</li>
    <li> It don&#x27;t smell the best but it work use it only 2-3 times a week leave my hair clean and soft</li>
    <li> Can not live without it!!</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo bar none. Wife spends a billion dollars at the dematologist on red spots without conclusion but I find this on the net and it cured the fungus related dermatitis. If you have animals and red spots then you probably have ringworm which this will get rid of.</li>
    <li> I use the Neutrogena anti-dandruff shampoo before (which does not work on me) and this one works. Plus a bottle can last 10 month.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately,  this product has an ingredient I&#x27;m sensitive to but, TheBeautyStore.Com was excellent with this situation.  I recommend ordering from them.  A+++</li>
    <li> my grandson is  liking this shampoo. hope it does the trick for him!! he is having oily hair and is very active...so we thought this would help him..</li>
    <li> I agree with Jesse&#x27;s review down below, but decided to give it an extra star because it really works to get rid of my dandruff.  I tried tree oil, witch hazel, Head and Shoulders, Selsun Blue, Denorex, T/Gel and finally Nizoral.  Nizoral worked for me because of the ingredient ketoconazole, however Nizoral is selling for like $100+ a bottle because Johnson and Johnson is on hold of producing more.. So I tried regenepure which also had the ingredient ketoconazole, but that did not work for me.  I thought I should try this before buying the Nizorals from overseas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency feels thin, and I feel like I have to use 3-5x as much cause it&#x27;s difficult to get a lather, but it works.  My dandruff is gone after the first application.  The smell isn&#x27;t as overpowering. So for $25 for 16 oz, that&#x27;s not too bad, but as soon as Nizoral is back on the market at its reasonable price of $10-$15, I&#x27;ll be back to it.  But for now, this&#x27;ll do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;///////////&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT OCT 5, 2013&lt;br /&gt;NIZORAL IS BACK ON THE SHELVES AT YOUR LOCAL DRUGSTORE (well in SO-CAL and NOR-CAL for me)  HALLELUJAH!</li>
    <li> I used this product once so far and my scalp feel sooooooo refresh , I like the smell as well ,smell very natural.</li>
    <li> it managed the itching a lot, specially when showering at night before bed</li>
    <li> I had issues with my scalp itchiung and flaking, tried Neutrogena T/Sal and other schampoos - this one is the first that actually helps. Love the peppermint scent.</li>
    <li> My preference is Nizoral but since Johnson &amp; Johnson has decided to make that product impossible to find, this dandruff shampoo seems to keep the itching and flaking eliminated. It does not leave the hair as smooth and shiney as other shampoos but it is the only shampoo other than Nizoral that works.</li>
    <li> I assume that it is what it claims to be, so that&#x27;s great. Unfortunately, I find that this shampoo doesn&#x27;t spread as well as the Nizoral it is replacing. I find that I need to use 3x as much or more to cover my scalp. For the price, it&#x27;s still an okay value, and until I find something better I would probably buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than the pump, I would prefer a more ordinary shampoo bottle, perhaps one that has a flat lid so i can store it upside down, pick it up, squeeze some out, close the lid, set it down, and continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was delivered promptly and packed well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making this available, sorry about the fair review.</li>
    <li> YES!!!!!!!  Finally I am replacing my long term use of Head and Shoulders with a product that keeps my scalp healthy but DOESN&#x27;T make my hair brittle.  Love this shampoo!!!!</li>
    <li> Great item! Received exactly as specified! Great Seller!</li>
    <li> With Nizoral 1% unavailable right now I came to amazon for alternatives. The sellers are charging outrageous prices for Nizoral A/D so I didn&#x27;t even bother. I tried the Nizoral 2% from overseas and I didn&#x27;t like the way it left my hair feeling. I do like this shampoo as it does seem to work as it should but the consistency is thin and watery. With the pump bottle I find I&#x27;m using 6-8 pumps of shampoo to clean my scalp. It also doesn&#x27;t lather well. The smell is overall pleasant and not to strong.</li>
    <li> It arrived with a broken pump and a litte leakage.&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have said it is not as sudsy as Nizoral but my scalp&lt;br /&gt;is not itching after first use so seems to work.</li>
