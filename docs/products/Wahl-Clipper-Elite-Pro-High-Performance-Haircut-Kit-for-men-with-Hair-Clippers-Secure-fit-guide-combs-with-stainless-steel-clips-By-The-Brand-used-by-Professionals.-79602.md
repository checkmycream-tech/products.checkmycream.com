      <li>Great clippers and a nice kit.</li>
      <li>This is perfect for me because I like a smooth fade on the bottom of my cuts.  </li>
      <li>the Army, and for a good while after the Army, I didn&#x27;t cut my hair.  </li>
      <li>like me you are hesitant to try it, Youtube some videos and you&#x27;ll be confident!</li>

      <li>The attachments are great and easy to put on/take off.</li>
      <li>Great price, lot&#x27;s of items included,  and easy to read instructions.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This cleans up nicely after use.</li>
      <li>So the case is a nice plus for the Wahl.</li>
      <li>So I started playing around with advice from YouTube and liked the results</li>
      <li>It saves so much money to just cut my husband&#x27;s hair and this is the best set that I&#x27;ve seen to do it with!</li>
      <li>cape is nice, and fastens with hook and loop tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is sturdily built for this price range with a metal lower body, and it has a nice weight and handfeel.</li>
      <li>In my house I cut my own hair and my niece and nephew&#x27;s as it saves a lot of cash every month for ourselves</li>
      <li>Honestly I don&#x27;t know and thankfully don&#x27;t have to find out.</li>
      <li>I have even kept a nice consumer level Wahl trimmer around for handling my beard and sideburns, and buzzing some of my pal’s head every now and then.&lt;br</li>
      <li>While I use my Wahl lithiums the most, the motor is not as good as these, and the model #</li>
      <li>comes with some nice extras, too, like a barber&#x27;s cape and nylon bag to hold the guide combs and accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>THIS IS A MUST if you want any kind of quality to your haircut.</li>
      <li>I cut my own hair about once a month using the number 3 guide...</li>
      <li>So the case is a nice plus for the Wahl.e everything in.</li>
      <li>While I use my Wahl lithiums the most, the motor is not as good as these, and the model #</li>
      <li>, I thought it was a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Well worth it!!!  </li>
      <li>for this elite pro model in particular, i am very impressed.</li>
      <li>It is heavier in the hand, but still very easy to use.</li>
      <li>This is probably my fourth set of clippers and ranks toward the very top, with the benefit of probably being the best value of any clippers I own.  </li>
      <li>For the most part, I liked it a lot.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how many strokes per minute this Deluxe pro kit uses.</li>
      <li>but he has very fine hair - and</li>
      <li>Elite Pro feels very cheap in comparison to Color Pro.</li>
      <li>Walh comes with a nice case, but it&#x27;s easy to pinch your hand on the clasp when closing</li>
      <li>I think these instructions would have made me feel more confident then.</li>
      <li>That is more than our Maltese goes to the groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Ten guide combs is generous and awesome.</li>
      <li>Oh, I really love this.  </li>
      <li>but I realized I needed better tools.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found better than Wahl.</li>
      <li>The cutter has more weight, is a bit bulkier and more top-heavy than the two cheaper home cutters I’ve owned.</li>
      <li>It vibrates more as well</li>
      <li>Love, love, love that.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Better cut, better attachments, more options.  </li>
      <li>Yeah, I have done that more than once.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was the top of the food chain and it shows.</li>
      <li>yeah, he was pleased with the cut.</li>
      <li>I have cost quite a bit more.  </li>

    <li> Best frigging clipper ever.</li>
    <li> First thing I want to say about this hair cutting set is that it&#x27;s the first clipper I&#x27;ve ever used on my daughter&#x27;s hair that didn&#x27;t tickle her. She&#x27;s got super thick hair and during the summer she likes to have it clipped very close in the back up to the tops of her ears and usually it takes a while because I have to be so careful not to go too high because she&#x27;s giggling. These have very little vibration, and clipping was quicker than it&#x27;s ever been before.They cut well with no pulling and they are powerful enough to handle my kids super thick hair quickly and without needing breaks to let them cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guides snap in easily. This set doesn&#x27;t come with left/right tapers but does come with a good selection of guides. I love the way the guides are made, it&#x27;s easy to tell if they are snapped into place the right way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shears are average. If you use scissors a lot, you&#x27;ll want to replace them.&lt;br /&gt;The cape is nice, and fastens with hook and loop tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a hair stylist- just a mom. My kids like me cutting their hair because it&#x27;s convenient and costs less than going to stylists and barbers. This set of clippers is just perfect for that kind of use.</li>
    <li> I was very reluctant to try this on my guy because he gets a very close buzz and one mistake will show up! But this set makes everything super simple!! Wonderful assortment of guards!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If like me you are hesitant to try it, Youtube some videos and you&#x27;ll be confident! The first time I used it I was terrified of cutting him or making him look like Chemo Kid but it looked great. I even took the guard off and finished with perfect results. It took me about half an hour the first two times because I was so scared of messing it up, but each time gets easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this again and I&#x27;ll recommend it to others! Even a cheap cut is $17 and he wants his head buzzed every week and a half. This is worth the money you save!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent starter kit for barbers who are begining their career and need a good quality set of clippers or veterans who just want to add to their existing set. The set comes with a great case, shears and guards. You will need to make sure the blades are adjusted and well lubricated as the clippers can be a bit noisy if not done.</li>
    <li> When I was in the Army I would run a pair of clippers like this over my head once a week.  I had three plastic hair cutting guides.  This things comes with 10!!!  It makes it really easy to taper the length of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the Army, and for a good while after the Army, I didn&#x27;t cut my hair.  I just  let it grow.  Then I got a job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I have gone to the barber every 6 months or so.  I get a buzz cut and then let it grow until my wife tells me she is sick of it.  I am an old man with thinning hair, so my wife wants it cut more often.  To maintain the length she wants I would have to go to the barbers every 4-6 weeks.  That is more than our Maltese goes to the groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price of 1 cut I can get all the cuts she wants with these things.  Well worth it!!!  These things cut great and the guides are easy to use.</li>
    <li> Noisier than my last clippers (Wahl Color Pro), but a significant improvement!  Better cut, better attachments, more options.  About as close to perfect as I could hope to get.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a corded model, this is certainly the &amp;#34;deluxe&amp;#34; model.  Wahl makes GREAT clippers for home use.  They last a long time. . . you don&#x27;t have to charge them. . . You can just keep on cutting. . .and cutting. . . and cutting. . . .  .Granted, if you like the portability of a cordless model, then the Wahl cordless is also great. . . but. . . you can&#x27;t cut forever, like you can with a corded model.  You&#x27;ll have everything you need with this model.  All the combs etc.  I haven&#x27;t found better than Wahl.</li>
    <li> I am a bit ashamed to say I have told my husband to use the dog clippers on his beard since he grew it out recently. He had thrown out his old WAHL clippers (that worked perfectly well) when he had started clean shaving again, and that was a mistake. But i had googled it and it said that people can use Dog clippers but dogs can not use Human clippers. So, it seems dog clippers are of higher quality than human clippers as their hair is more coarse and dense. Our dog clipper is &amp;#34;Wahl U-Clip Pro Home Pet Grooming Kit, by Wahl Professional Animal&amp;#34; and it features &amp;#34;Powerful and quiet, 7200 strokes per minute, professional high performance steel blades&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t know how many strokes per minute this Deluxe pro kit uses. Maybe they should list it. They only list &amp;#34;15% more power vs Wahl POWERDRIVE MOTOR&amp;#34;.  ELITE PRO also claims &amp;#34;cuts hair 40% faster vs. wahl standard precision blades.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I know it is kind of a bizarre comparison, but dog clippers work really well on humans and are probably of higher quality than most. What sets this clipper above the rest (and above the dog clippers) is the classy &amp;#34;secure fit&amp;#34; stainless steel attachment clips on the guide combs and its guide combs are &amp;#34;70% stronger&amp;#34;. It appears that this is the most ELITE and PRO of all the Wahl clippers, and at this price point you really can&#x27;t beat all the accessories it comes with. The hair cutting cape is something I would never think to purchase and it is Brilliant. Ten guide combs is generous and awesome. My husband said he used 4 on his beard alone. He looked really good and neatly trimmed, superior precision. I think he had been avoiding using the dog clippers. The styling comb was also very nice and was strong enough to comb through his beard. The included shears are just an extra bonus. This kit is really generous on all the extras.  The case it comes in is really good to, similar to what you may get at a hardware store as a tool case. Are these clippers tough enough to use on a dog? Honestly I don&#x27;t know and thankfully don&#x27;t have to find out.e clippers tough enough to use on a dog? Honestly I don&#x27;t know and thankfully don&#x27;t have to find out.</li>
    <li> The packaging and manual on this kit seem to disagree about whether to oil the clippers before first use, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a huge deal.  The guide combs have engraved metal identification numbers, so those should continue to be easy to read as time goes by.  The clippers work well and have a longer cord than was on our previous haircutting kit, so we can go farther away from the wall while using them.&lt;br /&gt;Our kit arrived with a broken guide comb (which I really can&#x27;t explain, given the fact that the kit comes in a hard-sided case, unless the comb was wedged sideways when the case was closed before leaving the factory).  I sent an email to Wahl on May 27th about the comb and received a response on June 1st giving me a phone number to call for a replacement.  I called--the wait wasn&#x27;t long, and the first representative I spoke to was able to help me--and received a new guide comb approximately a week later.&lt;br /&gt;Our previous haircutting kit came with a wide-toothed comb with handle; this one comes with a fine-toothed comb (at least by comparison).&lt;br /&gt;Our first couple haircutting experiences went fine--no complaints, so far as I&#x27;m aware.  Hair didn&#x27;t seem to catch badly and was cut as effectively as I&#x27;d expect.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this kit will serve us for years to come.</li>
    <li> This is the third clipper I&#x27;ve owned and it is definitely the best. The one before this was a cheaper Wahl. It&#x27;s a good brand- even the cheaper one still works well after several years. However, this is a definite step up:&lt;br /&gt;Pros/Improvements:&lt;br /&gt;-Quality of combs is excellent&lt;br /&gt;-Variety of comb sizes&lt;br /&gt;-Lever stays in place&lt;br /&gt;-More efficient cut&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few minor things I wish were better:&lt;br /&gt;-My old Wahl clipper came with a piece that the cord could be wrapped around for easy storage. This has no easy storage option for the cord.&lt;br /&gt;-My old Wahl came with a large cleaning brush that is very helpful. This only comes with a tiny oil brush.&lt;br /&gt;-This Walh comes with a nice case, but it&#x27;s easy to pinch your hand on the clasp when closing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are very minor and are eclipsed by how great the clipper itself is. Don&#x27;t settle for less.</li>
    <li> So I have always done some of my own hair cutting and helped other out from time to time with simple buzz cuts or flat tops.  I am in no way a professional, it is just my Mom cut my and my brother’s hair and I picked up a few things.  I have even kept a nice consumer level Wahl trimmer around for handling my beard and sideburns, and buzzing some of my pal’s head every now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I had the chance to get this kit, and I was very impressed.  First, it all comes in a nice plastic case.  To hold the clipper, the guide combs and all the other accessories, and this kit comes with a lot of stuff: : The clipper itself while not as heavy feeling as some I have used, still cuts hair great, is well balanced, and just feels good in the hand, the blades and the motor are warrantied for life too, so you can’t beat that. You get a little clear snap on clipper blade guard, it just covers the end of the blades so you don’t scratch anything whiel in storage.  A bunch of guide combs, one each of 1/2, 1, 1 1/2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. You get a large styling comb.  A little plastic via of blade oil, which will last you for years.  A tiny cleaning brush, to get all the hair off the clipper when done using it.  A pair of decent stainless steel scissors that also come with a clover, a nylon barber’s cape, a cord wrap, and a small guide comb storage bag (But I just leave them loose in the storage box. And one thing that surprised me was an English and Spanish Instructions/Styling Guide (folded up like a map).  This not only tells you how to used and maintain the clipper but offer basic instructions on cutting hair with a clipper, I thought it was a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback was the clipper guides are still plastic, but it is a durable plastic and I don’t really fear it breaking, but the weakest part of the comb guides, the part that clips on, is actually stainless steel, so I don’t have to fear them breaking or snapping off and forcing me to buy a replacement guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a really great kit for a home user.

    <li> This was the top of the food chain and it shows. The only thing I am unhappy about that they cannot make a bloody container where the attachments could be kept and displayed, probably with some spare positions for added (thicker or adjustable) pieces. This way every time you want to use it, you have to spill the damn thing into let&#x27;s say the sink, and the fish one by one to find the right number... If Apple made Haircutting kits that&#x27;s how it would come. (I am saying this even though I do not use Apple on a principle.)&lt;br /&gt;The blade does not go particularly close to the the edge, so it is not good to &amp;#34;cut corners&amp;#34; using it as a rough shave... I can do that with the Oster, and even with my other Wahls it was a closer cut with the edge of the blade. (In an unprofessional manner.) But it runs smooth like a .... I do not want to insult any carmaker...</li>
    <li> I do all my haircuts at home (with a little help), so I have tried a number of different clippers. This one tops them all. It is sturdily built for this price range with a metal lower body, and it has a nice weight and handfeel. This is built well and should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guide combs are stainless steel, unlike in most sets in which they are plastic. The tines on plastic guide combs tend to break, so having ones that are stainless is a big plus, especially if you plan to use this frequently or on a number of different people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleans up nicely after use. The hair doesn&#x27;t seem to cling to the metal like it does to plastic, and it is easily brushed off within seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with some nice extras, too, like a barber&#x27;s cape and nylon bag to hold the guide combs and accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only two complaints about this product, and these are complaints I have about every clipper I have ever owned:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The cord isn&#x27;t long enough. Clippers should be made with longer cords to maximize maneuverability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The case is hard to close with everything in it. It takes several minutes to get everything situated before it will snap shut without the risk of damaging the parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping to find that Wahl had solved these perpetual problems. If this had, I would have easily given this five stars.</li>
    <li> Very quiet and cuts great.  Very sturdy and heavy.  Feels exactly like professional salon clippers while running.  I like the new mechanism for taking the attachments on and off.  Much easier, and more sturdy.  I bought some clipper oil separately because they never include enough.  I have broken clippers in the past by trying to use other types of oil so you&#x27;ll need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with a salon hair cutting smock.  I love it and really needed one.</li>
    <li> When I was offered the Wahl Elite Pro Haircutting Kit to try I jumped at the chance.  I have been cutting my husband and kids hair at home with clippers for over 10 years now.&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box the Elite Pro system had me hopeful that this was going to work perfectly. The clippers are high quality and the guides clip on more securely than other clippers I&#x27;ve used. Even the smock was a much higher quality (not that cheap plastic) with Velcro closure.&lt;br /&gt;My most recent set of clippers I had purchased before receiving the Elite Pro was the Wahl Chrome Pro system.&lt;br /&gt;The Wahl Chrome Pro left me desiring more. My husband (who likes a really close cut and has really thick hair) seems to always be finding and cutting stray hairs that the Chrome Pro system had missed. We did not have this trouble with the Elite Pro.&lt;br /&gt;I also cut my 2 childrens hair with them. My 8 year old likes his cut short like his dad&#x27;s - but he has very fine hair - and the Elite Pro did great with his hair as well. My 10 year old has thick but longer hair and I had no trouble using the longer guides and managing my way through his mane.&lt;br /&gt;I did not experience the vibration problem as noted by another reviewer. But maybe that was because I was used to a lot of vibration from my other set.&lt;br /&gt;My next set of clippers (which will hopefully be a long time from now since acquiring this set) I will make sure I spend the extra money and invest in a good set of clippers like the Wahl Elite Pro.</li>
    <li> This should not be labeled Pro anything.  These are my third pair of Wahl trimmers and are by far the worst to date. My previous pair are excellent but had to be sent to their factory for blade alignment.  Ive been cuttinh my own hair for 10 years and with these clippers (no guard used) I have to consistently go over the same spots and I still find that there are hairs that arent being cut. I do no have thick hair at all and am extremely disappointed in this product.  Heed my advice and buy a better set.</li>
    <li> I usually cut my husband&#x27;s hair with trimmers similar to this, but they are smaller and not as heavy duty. This pair is amazingly good! It&#x27;s heavy and sturdy, so it won&#x27;t fall apart as you&#x27;re using it or changing sizes. It cuts well, and when I say well, it really gets the job done! The attachments are great and easy to put on/take off. It even gives you scissors to get you that close cut. It saves so much money to just cut my husband&#x27;s hair and this is the best set that I&#x27;ve seen to do it with! Very impressed!</li>
    <li> In getting this haircutting kit, I was upgrading from a more basic Wahl kit. This one definitely has a more professional feel and look. It is heavier in the hand, but still very easy to use. It cuts well and cleans up easily. Save your family tons of money by cutting hair at home. This is definitely worth the purpose.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting hair at home off and on for the past 20+ years.  First, my husband.  Then our four sons.  I&#x27;ve gone through a number of sets of clippers in that time, and have some pretty strong opinions about what works and what doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the reasons I love this particular haircutting set includes a lot of little things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The case latches closed securely, so I don&#x27;t worry about dumping everything out when I pick it up.  Yeah, I have done that more than once.&lt;br /&gt;*The cutting guides snap onto the clipper very securely.  Love, love, love that.&lt;br /&gt;*The cord is long enough for me to actually maneuver in the kitchen, to get around my squirmy 11 year old, or to get around my quite-large husband.&lt;br /&gt;*The cutting guides feel solid and well-made.  Obviously, they haven&#x27;t yet stood the test of time, but they are sturdier than any others I&#x27;ve had.  I&#x27;m not worried about pieces snapping off.&lt;br /&gt;*The cutting guides include 1/2 sizes in the lower numbers.  Oh, I really love this.  A couple of my guys prefer very close cuts, and being able to use a 1/2, 1 and 1 1/2 will be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading through the instructions that came with the kit, I was trying to think back to when I first started cutting my husband&#x27;s hair.  I think these instructions would have made me feel more confident then.</li>
    <li> I’ve been cutting my own hair once every 2 weeks for over 10 years now. I started with the Remington HC-80 which lasted for about 5 years until I plugged them into a 220 outlet in Europe and fried the motor. I then bought the Remington HC-822 which lasted me another 5 years until the guard that I use broke.( I always do my whole head with a #1) I went looking for replacement guards which are obviously not available so then I started looking for a new set of chippers with robust replicable guards. I ran across these at Meijer and noticed they had metal clips on the guards so I decided to make the purchase. Let me tell you that these are great clippers. Out of the box they feel very heavy duty and well made. When you turn them on its like firing up a piece of machinery, I can tell they are built to last. My first cut was the easiest cleanest cut I’ve ever done. The clippers glide through my hair with absolutely no resistance. Touching my hair afterward I can tell that the hair is cut clean; I like to rub my hand around after a fresh cut and it feels smooth and soft compared to my old clippers that left my head feeling rough. I would highly recommend these clippers.</li>
    <li> Loved the extra power this had. Smoother cuts👍</li>
    <li> Great product. Good quality and fast scissors make hair cut easy and quick.</li>
    <li> Excellent cutters, they really power right through cutting hair on the head and trimming beards up before a shave. In my house I cut my own hair and my niece and nephew&#x27;s as it saves a lot of cash every month for ourselves and they don&#x27;t want to go to anyone else to have them cut their hair because they trust me and like how I do it far more than their past experiences with barber shops. I also cut my brother&#x27;s hair as well with it this weekend and he&#x27;s happy with the result. I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for a couple years now and the money that I save with that alone makes for part of the money for vacations and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that these clippers at this time after doing several heads or hair that the blades are nice and sharp and have given no issues at all with powering through the thick heads of hair that the kids have and even my own. It cuts like butter, It should seeing as it&#x27;s new though but the true test will come into play at the end of the year to see how they have held up with doing about 4-5 cuts a month with everyone that needs their hair trimmed up. It doesn&#x27;t heat up as quick as my older set but it does need a little break after each head so that it can cool back down. I generally wait a good 30-60 minutes between heads so that it can be nice and cool. I tend to like to get it all done in a single day so that it&#x27;s only one clean up. A lot of the time I will mix in the other clippers for edging up so that I can make sure that each unit stays as cool as possible. Don&#x27;t over heat your hair clippers as each time you do it will do a little bit of damage which can add up over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments that came with these are okay but it would have been nice to get a set of the smaller 1/4 sizes instead of just the whole number sizes that it came with. but that&#x27;s not a big deal as using the adjustment handle can help alleviate the need for them but not entirely. They ones that came with the unit do have a nice metal clip that holds onto the cutting head instead of just plastic so they should last a nice long time.onto the cutting head instead of just plastic so they should last a nice long time.</li>
    <li> Very handy and sharp. Cuts well, but I had hope you could get a closer cut with it.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Wahl hair cutting kit for years. If I were asked to review my older model, I would give it 5 stars (it has worked fine for me and has saved me a considerable amount with hair-cut costs). This new kit includes several improvements: a more powerful motor, a handy bag to hold all the attachments, a useful apron, colored instructions on hair cutting and use, and a sturdy plastic case with a carrying handle to hold it all. One other improvement: before the guide combs were all plastic (I never had one break) but now their attaching piece on each is made of steel.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good investment for a family or an individual.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Quit after 1 month! Disappointed</li>
    <li> Wow! What a power tool. You can feel the weight in your hand. And when you turn it on, you almost expect to be zapped. But seriously, this is a great kit that is professional in both quality and accessories. You get 10 sizes for shaving from 8 all the way down to 1/2 size lengths. You also get a comb and scissors as well as a plastic cover to catch the shavings. It plugs into the wall, no chargeable version here. I have went through so many chargeable shavers and in the long run, there will be at least once where it will not charge fully and dies in the middle of a shave. You don&#x27;t have to worry about that here. Plug it in and turn it on. Also has a lever to determine the closeness of the shave, or if you want to taper the cut. Comes complete in a plastic carrying case which is not the most durable plastic case, but serves its purpose effectively. Of all the shavers I have reviewed in the past, this one definitely stands as my favorite.</li>
    <li> Excellent clipping quality. My husband shaves his head every other week and this one does it with zero hassle. I find myself going over his head multiple times less than with our philips shaver. Plug ins tend to be a bit stronger and heavier, like this one, but if you need something that is rechargeable and wireless, you definitely lose out on some power. This looks and feels like the ones they use at sport clips. Great quality</li>
    <li> Our hair clippers that we had built by Wahl that my dad used o my hair when nI was just a kids just died. That&#x27;s 50 years of service. These feel just like them. Excellent hair clippers. Worth the extra money. I looks like it is built to last a long time and is very comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> This is probably my fourth set of clippers and ranks toward the very top, with the benefit of probably being the best value of any clippers I own.  Below I will give you a rundown of the good features of these clippers, but first my own personal reason of why you should buy a pair of clippers at all, whether it&#x27;s these or another model.  They can save you a ton of money.  I have been cutting my own hair for years (and do a very good job of it) and each time, every 3-4 weeks, this saves me about $20, maybe more, over what I would spend at the barber.  The savings are even more extreme if you factor in the cost of pet grooming.  We have two spaniels that need regular haircuts and I do both of them myself (with Wahl clippers, incidentally).  Each time, this saves us $50-75 per dog every few months.  Clippers will very rapidly pay for themselves.  Properly taken care of (oiling before, during, and after use, and keeping them clean), they will last for years.  Even the blades on our other Wahl Elites have lasted ages and shown no sign of reduced cutting ability.  Definitely buy clippers if you have any inclination to save this unnecessary expense.  You will not regret it.  OK, now the features of these particular clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►  I have been using the Wahl Elites in the rechargeable lithium model, which I love (I think Wahl updated the lithium version they sell, but similar thing to the one shown in the comparison chart on this page).  My review is somewhere on Amazon.  The clippers are excellent and totally reliable -- they are my regular go-to clippers, even though I own a pair of Andis clippers that cost me around $140.  I mainly like the cordless lithium design, but these Wahl Elites in the corded version are a MUCH better value and probably slightly better in terms of motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;► The Wahl elite blades are MOST EXCELLENT.  They are very sharp, produce a very even, clean cut, and last for ages.  As I mentioned, I oil these things religiously (get a big jar of clipper oil if you use them much) and that helps them last longer.  They are very high quality blades that do great on a wide variety of hair textures, both thick and fine.  To top it off, the blades have a 5 year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;► The motor on the corded version sold here is fairly quiet and smooth, even better than the Lithium.  They have a really solid, expensive, low rumble sound similar to my Andis.  I&#x27;m very happy.  I think the motor on this thing is probably the best of any product Wahl sells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;► The cord is super long (8 feet) and that helps in all sorts of ways.  Cheap clippers give you a short little cord that always get in the way.  These clippers, for only marginally more, give you a super thick, long cord to make sure it never holds you back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;► The blade guides offered by Wahl are top notch, in my opinion.  The reason is that they slide securely into place and hold their position, unlike many other cheaper offerings that clip into place and fall of at the worst moments.  This model also gives you a lot of different blade guides (14) to make sure that every length is covered.  The range of lengths is really outstanding with this model and is better than probably any other clipper at the same price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;► For fine adjustments of cutting height, there is a blade adjuster that lets you retract the cutting edge in small increments.  This is perfect to help smooth the transition between, say, 1/4&amp;#34; and 3/8&amp;#34; on the side of one&#x27;s head.  Works really well.  Just practice with it and you&#x27;ll figure it out.  Great feature to help get &amp;#34;between sizes&amp;#34; when you have a limited number of clipper attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;► The motor tends to run fairly cool and I have not experienced any excessive heating with the limited usage I give it.  To keep the blades cool, I recommend some cooling spray for clippers.  I think there are a few different brands.  This stuff basically cools down the metal at the same time as it lubricates the blades.  I use it when I clip the dogs and it keeps me going for a long time without letting the blades get hot (which would damage them, since the metal gets soft at high temperatures).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I think that&#x27;s about it.  Overall I&#x27;m very happy with these clippers and would highly recommend to anyone.  While I think my Andis clippers are higher quality, they cost like $140.  While I use my Wahl lithiums the most, the motor is not as good as these, and the model # I have cost quite a bit more.  Dollar for dollar, these Wahl Elite 79602s might be the best clippers you can buy.  Highly recommended.e same time as it lubricates the blades.

    <li> Forget the rest, get the best. The Wahl 79602 is fabulous.</li>
    <li> Definately a higher quality than the color one as well as the other typical models, the unit is solid, well built, thicker cord. The trimmer guides are very durable and snap on with stainless steel clips. The accessories you get in the hard plastic storage container are premium as well, the comb and scissors are very nice. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and it feels like it will last quite a bit longer than past models.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of clippers in the past, Nothing compares to this one... It&#x27;s the Best</li>
    <li> pretty good but not worth it</li>
    <li> This Wahl kit is excellent.  The single speed clipper works extremely well and has a blade adjustment level to go from close to very close.  This is perfect for me because I like a smooth fade on the bottom of my cuts.  The attachments work as expected are easy to come on and off.  Love that it comes with a case and includes a perfectly useable scissors for long hair trimming.  Just keep the blades clean and lubed after every use and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> The cutter has more weight, is a bit bulkier and more top-heavy than the two cheaper home cutters I’ve owned. While this requires a stronger, steadier hand, it also makes it easier to set and guide the cutter on the person’s head.  It vibrates more as well but the motor has a consistency and power the others lacked – it’s also quieter and lower in ‘pitch’. This isn’t a toy or a cheap consumer-grade item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guide combs snap on easily but solidly and the release tab is effortless – no hassle at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The male ‘subject’ I tried the cutter on has fairly thick, wavy hair and reported no discomfort or excessive noise – and yeah, he was pleased with the cut. I’m not a pro but I learned a long time ago from a pro roommate and even my wife is confident-enough to let me do occasional trims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pouches, scissors (love the cap cover on the scissors!) and comb included with the kit make for a attractive and function package –While it’s targeted to the home user it can hold up to pro use. For what it’s worth, I checked with my local haircutter whether or not she’d heard of Wahl and she confirmed “Oh yeah, they’re the standard”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Solid, Feels like the Real Deal</li>
    <li> After many years of paying for haircuts we decided to buy a quality hair cutting kit and do our own trims. We were successful in half of our goals; We bought a high quality hair cutting kit. However this venture taught me that not everyone should cut their family&#x27;s hair. My kids are NOT amused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Wahl Elite Pro Haircitting Kit is an outstanding kit in the hands of those able to miss ears in the process. The item description on Amazon lists the following pieces: Premium Multi-Cut Clipper. Clipper blade guard, premium storage case. Guide combs: Numbers 1/2, 1, 1 1/2-3/16, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Large stying comb, blade oil, cleaninbg brush, stainless steel scissors, scissors blade cover, large nylon signature barbers cape, cord wrap, guide comb storage bag. I was actually pretty overwhelmed when I first open the tool kit. Honestly it really should be easy to use in the hands of those who are not habitually clumsy. Alas, I am not that person as my kids will attest to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I have nothing bad to say about the product. Great price, lot&#x27;s of items included,  and easy to read instructions. Nothing wrong with that.</li>
    <li> Reasonably quiet and cool running. Powerful motor, cuts very cleanly with no pulling of the hair. Good starter accessory kit with everything you need to cut a variety of hair lengths. The sized combs in particular are very sturdy and attach securely to the clippers. I expect it to last for years as long as I do the normal cleaning and oiling of the blades.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works extremely well and is also very well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hair for 17 years. And by cutting I should say shaving my head. I find to be much easier to do it myself then going to a barber every couple of weeks. And it&#x27;s a lot cheaper too. Now for the past couple of years I have used a rechargeable set of hair clippers. Yes they are wireless but after awhile they are hard to charge and become a pain in the butt to use. So ai was happy to have the opportunity to try out these Wahl clippers. I have used Wahl clippers in the past and loved them. This set is just how I remembered. They are like using the clippers the pros use. While there are numerous guides I have no need for them. I use the straight up clippers with no guard and get a nice close cut. I could not recommend these more. If you prefer cutting hair at home or have thought about starting, then pick these up now. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> great tools. We have had  a Wahl Haircutting kit for about a decade  but were delighted to get this Elite set . This workes even better than than the older set and my grandson and spouse both love the results. The kit has every thing  we need for giving haircuts and  the set is very easy to clean  and maintain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit for 4 years and got it for $20 back then. Now I have decided to get the best one from Wahl for home use which is Elite Pro. I got very disappointed by the quality, vibration and the noise! I gave 5 stars to cheaper model. Elite Pro feels very cheap in comparison to Color Pro.</li>
    <li> At the posting of this review, I have only just purchased these clippers today. Prior to owning these, I used Wahl Haircut and Beard Clippers which I purchased at Walmart for about $32. I upgraded to these and I can already tell that they are much nicer than my other clippers. The kit comes with very sturdy guards that include 1/2, 1,1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. It comes with a cape/apron/smock for a person to wear during a haircut to avoid getting hair on themselves. The clippers seem to be pretty good quality and much better than a typical walmart clipper. Some walmarts do not carry these, but some do. They cut very close to skin with no guard if you compare them to a walmart clipper, and they are probably equal to some professional clippers. They come with shears (scissors) that don&#x27;t look like anything special except that they have a sheath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a corded clipper and the cord is 8 feet long. When you turn this thing on it sounds like a laser or a lightsaber. I actually recently cut my hair with my old clippers that were cheaper walmart ones so I need to wait for it to grow or for a friend to want me to cut their hair before I can actually test these ones. Based on the feel of these clippers, I expect them to be a lot better than my previous ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the instructions that are included I learned that these clippers are specifically for home-use. Wahl will not cover any damages that happen to the clipper if it is used in a barbershop. These are powerful clippers compared to some, but I expect that they are not expected to last long with constant use such as being used in a barbershop throughout the entire day. I expect these clippers to last me a long time and I only use them to cut my hair and my friends&#x27; hair when they ask me to. If I was to ever want to be a barber, I would probably purchase Andis Masters and/or Wahl Seniors as my business clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this review as time passes.</li>
    <li> It worked great for me. I have very thick hair and these clippers went through it like it wasn&#x27;t even there.</li>
    <li> This haircutting kit has everything you need to do male grooming at home.  The clippers and included combs allow controlled length.  The included shears can clean up bangs, etc.  Best of all, it comes with a case that keeps everything organized when you&#x27;re not using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a corded kit with steel clipping knives.  They are sharp and cut without pulling the hair.  The motor feels capable and does not bog down in thick hair -- mine is quite thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a bit of training, you can save on trips to the barber with this set.  It&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Wahl clipper to shave my head for about 10 years. I bought the inexpensive MC2 model from a drug store and it has lasted all this time without any problems. I use my clipper about 8-10 times per year and only cut my own hair. I&#x27;ve been happy with my old Wahl, but was excited to give the &amp;#34;Elite Pro&amp;#34; model a try. For the most part, I liked it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right away, I could tell the difference in the way the blade cut my hair using the Elite Pro. It&#x27;s possible that my old clippers have a dull blade so anything with a new blade would&#x27;ve been quite noticeable. Still, I was impressed at how quickly the blade cut through my coarse hair. It did snag on me right above to ears on both sides, though, which was a bit unnerving. Maybe I didn&#x27;t put enough oil on the blades before getting started with the new blade? I have a 4 ounce bottle of Wahl oil and was generous applying it after I finished my cut. The cord on the Elite Pro is definitely a heavy duty cord compared to the MC2 model I have. The plastic body seems durable, but doesn&#x27;t seem as rugged as I&#x27;d expect an &amp;#34;elite pro&amp;#34; model to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The accessories that come with the Elite Pro are nice to have, but not something I&#x27;ll likely ever use. The guides with the metal clips are a premium quality over the cheap plastic-only ones that my old clippers came with. The plastic case looks nice on the outside and does hold all the accessories and clipper inside, but it&#x27;s not molded specifically to hold the clipper in place. Think of it as a lunchbox where you just throw everything in together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Wahl Elite Pro clippers and if you cut hair at home, they&#x27;re a good set and will pay for itself in just a few cuts.</li>
    <li> The primary requirement of a hair clipper and blade is that it cut hair easily and accurately. It&#x27;s important to have that sweet spot between too light and flimsy (which means it will break the first time it slips off a table) and too heavy, which causes fatigue for the hair cutter. Though my experience with hair cutters has been limited to the Oster brand, I&#x27;m pleased to say this Wahl has exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper body is contoured to the hand which reduces hand cramping and increases the user&#x27;s ability to maneuver the clipper as needed. There is some vibration as is to be expected when you&#x27;re holding a motor in your hand, but the vibration is not significant (at least with my set of clippers) and didn&#x27;t cause any discomfort. The clipper housing remains cool for the duration of the hair cut and only begins to warm up after several haircuts. Even this it isn&#x27;t uncomfortably warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with literally everything you need to complete a haircut without searching for scissors, combs, etc. around your home. The kit proivdes a selection of blade sizes and comb sizes for precise cutting. Though it&#x27;s too early to know if the blades will remain sharp for a long time, they are certainly sharp and ready to cut out of the box. The combs are heavy plastic with metal attachments and allow the cutter to cut hair to the length desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers come with a long cord which means you can easily move from front to back and side to side when giving a haircut.  When you&#x27;re all finished, use the small blade brush to brush out any hair from the blades and store everything in the handy (and very sturdy) storage box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl has done a great job in designing and manufacturing these clippers. They should provide years of service if treated well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been to a barbershop one time in the last 24 years, and that was when my wife escaped for three weeks. I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results of her cutting my hair, and we&#x27;ve saved thousands of dollars, not to mention the time spent traveling to and from the barbershop and waiting my turn. So we&#x27;re both big advocates of home haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the first Wahl clippers that we&#x27;ve used, and we&#x27;re very pleased with them. For the last couple of years, we&#x27;ve been using cordless clippers, so it felt strange to have the cord dangling, but it was just a matter of getting used to it. And weighing 19 ounces including the cord, they&#x27;re noticeably heavier than our cordless clippers. But it&#x27;s also obvious that the Wahl clippers have a more powerful motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ten guide combs are clearly marked for cutting length in both inches and millimeters. The combs slip onto the clippers easily and securely. The end of each comb is rounded so it doesn&#x27;t dig into the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers have a power adjustment screw that can be adjusted for peak efficiency in homes where the voltage is low. It seemed okay, so we left it alone. Note that there is a distinct popping noise when the motor starts. It only lasts an instant, and it didn&#x27;t bother us, but it spooked our dog a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had two haircuts so far with the Wahl, and they both went very smoothly. I have a buzz cut, so we put on the #1 comb (1/8th inch/3mm). The instructions include a brief primer on haircutting for those who haven&#x27;t done it before. Professional barbers go to school to learn their trade, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that you can&#x27;t do a decent job at home with a little practice, so if you&#x27;re thinking of taking that plunge, go ahead and have a go at it. The Wahl kit has everything you need to get started. It doesn&#x27;t take too much practice before you&#x27;ll wonder why you didn&#x27;t do it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may seem like a small thing, but the kit includes a very nice case to store everything in. We had one name brand haircutting kit a few years ago that had no case at all - we stored the pieces in the cardboard box it came in. So the case is a nice plus for the Wahl.e everything in.

    <li> Very nice clippers. This is the second set of Wahl clippers I&#x27;ve owned, the first set I&#x27;ve had for almost 20 years and they are still going strong. I just thought I would treat myself to a new set. First thing I had to do was align the blades according to the instructions, as they were way out of alignment...THIS IS A MUST if you want any kind of quality to your haircut. I cut my own hair about once a month using the number 3 guide...I like the buzz cut. Between this new set and my old set I should be cutting my own hair for the rest of my life. These get my 5 Stars.</li>
    <li> Great clippers and a nice kit.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  I started cutting my own hair and was pretty pleased with the results.  Since.my favorite hairdresser left I have not had the haircuts that I like.  So I started playing around with advice from YouTube and liked the results but I realized I needed better tools.  This kit has it all, the great scissors and of course the awesome clippers.  I find the clippers useful for feathering the sides of my layers and the scissors for more precision. Definitely a good buy for quality!</li>
    <li> Quite good hair cutting kit; heavy duty built; its motor is not very quite but strong; I like this kit set; recommend to all.</li>
    <li> Bought this at a store in person. First, out of all the brands at varying prices that ive owned, id say by far that i personally think Wahl is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this elite pro model in particular, i am very impressed. Its motor seems much stronger than other models, it cuts through my hair with little effort and no snagging. Other clippers ive had would snag my hair or my hair would pass through without being cut (i have straight thin hair).&lt;br /&gt;I do like the metal tab at the back of the attachments since it seems to hold onto the clipper better than the plain plastic style, but i do not like that it does NOT include tapered ear attachments as ive used those with previous models to help give the area around my ears a cleaner look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From experience in owning a few of these just a tip, do not ever use any oil to lubricate the blades other than oil made specifically for hair clippers. Also, do not apply the oil directly from the bottle to the blades. The oil bottle comes sealed in a little bag with a small black brush, put just one or two drops of oil onto that brush and then brush the oil onto the blades with the clipper OFF, youre looking for just a very light coating. Then turn on the clipper and let it run for a few seconds with no attachments on it to help the oil lubricate the blades more evenly.</li>
