      <li>You get a pretty large bottle of this and that&#x27;s a great deal for the price .</li>
      <li>my 7 year old told me i smelled good and asked if i was wearing perfume &amp; i get allot of compliments when im wearing either.</li>
      <li>, it smells good its not as powerful as the perfume but still has the strong lasting fragrance that i love.</li>

    <li> Wonderful and sexy. Smells just as the perfume.</li>
    <li> Arrived a day earlier than expected. Smells just like the perfume, not as strong though. And doesn&#x27;t last as long. I gave it 4 stars because the cap was so stuck on the bottle that it took me almost 5 minutes to get it off.</li>
    <li> I love Paris Hilton body mist , it last all day and the bottle is extra large for the price.</li>
    <li> Smell so good, it has a soft, delicious and delicate fragance, I rated four star because It doesn&#x27;t stay for so long... :(</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to order this perfume because it was from Paris Hilton, but it has a great smell.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this perfume. Not too strong and it lasts throughout the day. I can still smell it on me after my workouts as well.</li>
    <li> excelente producto!!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, and 100% worth for money... Like it very much</li>
    <li> exelent producto very good</li>
    <li> This  is the largest bottle of this perfume I have even seen. it smells nice and I am so happy. The was shipped quickly and arrived in tack.</li>
    <li> Smells just as a body mist version of a perfume should. Ordered it months ago, use if often. May not last as long as the perfume, but the mist, itself, lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. I love it.</li>
    <li> I loove this Perfume!!!! I.actually wear it as.deodorant because it so potent. I love this hands down</li>
    <li> I bought and gave to my cousin and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Smells good. My Wife just love it... I like it</li>
    <li> Smells great but does not last long. Would opt for the parfume over the body mist. Nice for bedtime wear but scent wears off by morning unless you spray entire bottle. This body mist wasn&#x27;t worth the money. Other body mists deliver scent intensity that last longer.</li>
    <li> It smells nice, not too strong. Its good for a younger women. Fresh scent. Good value. Would this for a teen girl.</li>
    <li> The scent really lasts for a mist . You get a pretty large bottle of this and that&#x27;s a great deal for the price . Just like most people I&#x27;m not a fan of Paris but, this really does smell good.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love the perfume version of this so i decided to buy the cheaper body mist version of the same fragrance i love, it smells good its not as powerful as the perfume but still has the strong lasting fragrance that i love. my 7 year old told me i smelled good and asked if i was wearing perfume &amp; i get allot of compliments when im wearing either. this weekend i spent the day chasing cows on my brothers farm running threw cow s***  afterwards a friend asked hubby and i to go with him up to a pond to visit some mutual friends of ours, we had literally just walked in the door and i had no time to shower!! i had cleaned off with a hose on the farm but the smell of cows/farm was still there. it was all i could smell. grabbed both the perfume and body mist and 2 squirts of perfume 3 of the body mist out i went.  in the car our friend said holy cow who smells like a french whore. i was dying laughing over that.so maybe that much was a little over powering at first but in minutes it was very bearable and until i told him he had no idea i was on the farm. anyone who was raised on a farm knows thats a smell you cant ever seem to get out of your clothes much less cover up.  this more then did the trick HA ha hahahaha ha ha</li>
    <li> Smell amazing! I love this perfume, I most likely will be buying some more. If anyone is wondering about the size it&#x27;s the same size as the perfume bottles from bath&amp;body works .</li>
    <li> My friend recommended this and I loved it.Good to use as a go to regular mist.Smell is good and not overpowering.Loved it for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Smells like the perfume. Love this stuff</li>
    <li> Its actually nice but i find  that most other body mist/sprays etc besides bath n body works or body fabtasies seems ti be slughtly watered down.the scent is nice enuf jus seems a teeny bit watery.does last prob like a 3-4 hrs but i work in a food pkace(so clothes n me smells oily).i do recommend tho</li>
    <li> One way for me to better adjust to this stifling heat and humidity is to wear a fragrance accordingly. I have to say, I was VERY hesitant to try this just because of the name. Is it Just me or do most celebrity-promoted fragrances stink? Anyway, after smelling this in the store I was happily impressed. I really like it and so do most of my friends.</li>
    <li> Actually smells really nice! It has a great scent that lasts, but isn&#x27;t overpowering. I would buy this body spray again even though the thought of helping Paris Hilton accumulate more wealth makes me want to vomit.</li>
    <li> Smells good but has a strong alcohol sent When you first spray on but wears off after abit.</li>
    <li> Smells good this is my second bottle</li>
    <li> Wow this smell is just absolutely amazing. &amp;#60;3 I would so buy this again....</li>
    <li> Smells good, shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite smells!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t paying attention when I ordered this and thought it was the perfume. However, I was not disappointed because it lasted longer than some of the perfumes I purchased with this order. This scent is divine!</li>
    <li> my girlfried love it, the smell last longer than expected.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of this fragrance, but my sister loves it. It smells just like the regular eau de toilette, only lighter. Complain: It doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
