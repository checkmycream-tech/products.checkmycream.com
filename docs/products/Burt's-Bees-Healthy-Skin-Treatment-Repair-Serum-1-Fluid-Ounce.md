<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even waste your money on trying all those other products that are so expensive... this product is awesome!  I&#x27;ve spent big money on products that promises you this, that and the other thing... well, do they deliver?  No.  Does this little bottle of repair serum?  Yes.  I used this for just a few days, didn&#x27;t tell anyone I bought it, and within a couple of days my husband was telling me I must feel good or something because I looked 15 years younger.  I told him about the Burt&#x27;s Bees products I purchased and he came in for a closer look and was surprised at how soft my harsher lines were and how the softer lines were non-existent.  Good stuff.  Buy it.  This is 99.4% natural serum.  Don&#x27;t spend your money on the high-dollar stuff that&#x27;s full of chemicals.</li>
    <li> Doesnt work for my eyes wrinkle but work well for my face</li>
    <li> A lady at a cosmetics counter said not to use oil on rosacea. I corrected her because this product really helps calm rosacea and it is pretty much just oils!</li>
    <li> Love it! Great product for tired eyes. I definitely recommend this! It lasts for a really long time as well</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I really like the product.  I can only use it in the evening as it is oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 37 yrs. old, I noticed that I had 2 lines above my upper lip. I don&#x27;t smoke, but somehow the yrs. have caught up with me :) I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 wks now and I can see a big difference in my upper lip. I also, use it around my eyes and I truly like what I see, the lines around my eyes look softer!</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;ve only been using this [[ASIN:B0009ET5O4 Burt&#x27;s Bees Healthy Treatment Repair Serum, 1 Fluid Ounce]] for less than a week but I fell in love with it at first use! I love the smell, just like the Aromatherapy Spas I&#x27;ve been too. If you don&#x27;t like the smell of lavender, then I highly discourage getting this. But its very calming and although it&#x27;s an oil, it was light on my skin and I felt that my face quickly absorbed this serum. I couldn&#x27;t find this product in stores so will order another one as a back-up. I&#x27;ve only had the bottle for a few days but have already made a good dent in it. Thinking of buying a few bottles as gifts. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I wish this did more for my skin but it didn&#x27;t. It smells wonderful, of roses! But it&#x27;s far too heavy an oil for my early 30&#x27;s skin. I instead used it for a while on my hands since it&#x27;s very heavy and takes quite a while to absorb. It is in a very sturdy thick glass container. You can easily store it on a shelf, that thing fell to the floor (more then once) and never even chipped.</li>
    <li> This serum is a great mosterizer I use it along with Face Lift at your finger tips(the massage for your face that is in the book).If I bought the ingrediance individually it would be very expensive, so it is a great deal for the money.I stretch mine by adding other oil to it,olive or vitamine e.This has made my skin soooo soft,but not everything is for everyone.</li>
    <li> One of the best products to keep my skin free from occasional outbreaks. As known in homeopathy, calendula, one of this product&#x27;s ingredients, possesses strong antiseptic and cleansing qualities. No wonder, I have not experienced any blemishes since I began using it.  Besides, it is a great moisturizer with subtle herbal (heavenly!!!) fragrance for maintaining incredible skin softness. Works well for me!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and it seems to repair some fine lines, but only time will tell. Only using a week!</li>
    <li> This Serum is a  perfect and inexpensive solution to dry facial skin. I use it on my whole face, eyes and neck two 2 to 4 times a week. It&#x27;s my answer to keeping my skin normal in a very dry, high desert climate. I&#x27;m a certified aromatherapist so I need to share with you all that natural rose essential oils, (attar of rose, rosehips, et al), are the only natural products that actually promotes new skin cell growth. This Burt&#x27;s product is FULL of rose essential oils and loads of others that are good for skin care. I have oily skin and it&#x27;s hard to find something that isn&#x27;t too heavy. It makes my skin feel like silk and smells heavenly. If you use at night before bed the scent will put you in a much better mood. Honest.</li>
    <li> I recently got a new tattoo. I had been using a lotion product recommended by my tattoo artist, but really wanted to go with something more natural. This stuff is great! It immediately soothed my new tattoo, and kept all the \\&quot;itchies\\&quot; away. My skin healed so much faster with this product. I will continue to use it on my future work. Do not be afraid of the word \\&quot;oil\\&quot;. These oils seep into your skin and repair, and did not cause me to break out at all. I have used this stuff on my face too! It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I work at a natural face and body care shop in Montpelier, Vermont ~ where we REALLY need help with our skin in the long winter! We also sell the Dr. Hauschka line of skin care, which is miraculous, BUT this Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Serum is really effective, and costs a lot less. It softens your skin, creates a youthful dewy look and it smells amazing too. I love it!</li>
    <li> Works great! Ever get that irritated patch around your eyes?&lt;br /&gt;This was the only thing that got rid of my dry flaky irritated patches. Overnight!</li>
    <li> At first I only used this as suggested, around the eyes and mouth, but recently started applying it to my whole face followed by a moisturizing night cream.  My face looked better within two days.  The redness and dryness are gone and my skin glows in the morning.  I was worried about clogging pores but that hasn&#x27;t happened to me yet and the results are amazing.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I don&#x27;t use this as an anti-aging serum yet b/c I&#x27;m just too young. I use it on the eczema I get along my hairline, and it works wonders! It absorbs pretty quickly and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy like traditional lotions do. Also, you don&#x27;t get that filmy build-up like you do with lotions. It smells great, like massage oil (and I&#x27;m sure this would make very good, and kind of expensive, massage oil). I also use it on the dry eyebrow skin that I get from the hard water in my area. It doesn&#x27;t make my eyebrows look greasy or make the hairs stick to my skin, and after only one night of dabbing this stuff on my eyebrows, I didn&#x27;t have flaky eyebrows! I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m going to finds a lot more uses for this stuff over time.</li>
    <li> Love it. Love it. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, this product just makes you feel good. You can mixed with a natural moisturizer and used in face or body. Great product</li>
    <li> GOOD SMELL, NOT SO OILY, AND ABSROB WELL</li>
    <li> Yet America&#x27;s biggest secret!  The first few days that I used this serum I couldn&#x27;t understand what the fuss was about.  After a week I was sold and will never buy any other anti-aging serums or creams.  This is the winner hands down.  The price is extremely inexpensive.  You might think it&#x27;s pricey, but I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and a half and the bottle still looks like it&#x27;s never been used.  A little goes a long way and I&#x27;ll probably have this for over a year.  When was the last time you could say that for anti-aging serum?  I spent $17 for an entire year...shocking, I know.  You can&#x27;t go wrong, just give the product time and you will see what everyone else sees who uses this.  I&#x27;m loyal now - will not ever waste money again on the junk that advertising sells.  This IS it!</li>
    <li> Thanks to this serum I developed Cholinergic urticaria, a sensitivity to heat that causes extreme itchiness. Use very sparingly at your own risk, or not at all. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. For all the trouble it&#x27;s caused me, it didn&#x27;t repair anything at all! It&#x27;s a fine moisturizer, but there is much better available.</li>
    <li> Yes, I bought this for my face. None of my friends or family know I use this.     Like all wrinkle products it won&#x27;t necessarily erase all your wrinkles but it will fade them and make them less noticeable. Great moisturizer for sensitive areas around the face.     The scent is very agreeable as it&#x27;s not overly fragrant like some creams. Smells like a rustic hippie dreadlocks without the stench; earthy and natural.</li>
    <li> love the serum. skin never felt better - even better than more expensive serums and i love that burt&#x27;s bees is natural and quality. shipping was fast and there when promised. would buy again!</li>
    <li> I stumbled onto this product while searching for a good moisturizer and bought it based on the high ratings and glowing reviews. I&#x27;m so, so glad I did! I just can&#x27;t say enough about this wonderful serum and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days. The first time I used it I slathered on a lot all over my face and neck and within 30 minutes my skin had absorded it all and was so soft and silky. Even my fingertips that I applied it with were soft. I immediately subscribed so I could have this delivered every month; I can tell already that I&#x27;ll be using it alot. I&#x27;m having my 15 year old daughter use it at night on her forehead where she has a few recent acne scars. I don&#x27;t expect it to work miracles on my laugh lines (the only wrinkles I have), but I can certainly see how this serum could prevent new wrinkles and lines by keeping the skin so hydrated and soft. I haven&#x27;t tried to use it under make-up yet, but I&#x27;m sure that I could only use a drop or two since any more than that would be too heavy and greasy for make-up (after all, most of the ingrediants are oils), but just using it liberally at night has done wonders for my skin tone, as well as the overall look and feel of my skin. The smell is pretty, but light and not at all overwhelming. This serum has replaced my night cream, my eye creams, my moisturizer, and every skin product except for sunscreen; It&#x27;s really that good. I plan on buying a bottle for my older daughter, my daughter-in-law, and my sister too. Every woman should know of this product. If I had to choose just one beauty product to use for the rest of my life, this would be the one. All the Burt&#x27;s Bees products that I&#x27;ve tried are just so wonderful, but this one is my all-time favorite.</li>
    <li> This was basically just oil-which is fine if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for. It was useless to me and I don&#x27;t really understand how oil could be useful for anyone.  I returned this item. The smell is not bad, but it&#x27;s very strong.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome moisturizer. I have sensitive skin that breaks out from certain products. This actually prevents breakouts and moisturizes my skin. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the price..this is MUCH better than much more expensive products.. Thanks Burt&#x27;s Bees for making a wonderful product that won&#x27;t break my bank AND delivers!!</li>
    <li> This product is just not what I&#x27;m used to in terms of under eye treatment. It&#x27;s basically a mix of essential oils and is just that- oil. It feels oily and weird under the eyes and on the eye lids. It&#x27;s also WAY to fragrant. I have not noticed any benefit after using it for over 6 months. Still searching for that fabulous eye cream...</li>
    <li> I have been having a serious case of dry, red itchy lower lids on my eyes, and this serum has helped with it immensely! No more dryness, it zapped it in 2 days :)  EDIT: Even though my problem is gone, I have continued to use this product every day. It makes my eyes look fresh in the morning. I use it day and night and only around my eyes and upper cheeks so that I don&#x27;t use too much of the product (it lasts way longer this way, I&#x27;ve barely used any of the bottle!)  I should also note on the scent. My boyfriend asks every time, \\&quot;what is that perfume? It smells really good\\&quot; and he starts sniffing and always laughs when I tell him it&#x27;s my eye oil. So there you have it; the smell is good too! I&#x27;m thinking of buying this for mother for her birthday, as this may be a good anti-wrinkle oil and she always spends so much money on those ridiculous non-organic wrinkle creams that have tons of chemicals in them! This is a better buy I think.</li>
    <li> This is my go to everything. Hair oil, eye oil, general dry skin treatment, you name it. I have really dry skin and I love this stuff. One bottle lasts for a really long time too.</li>
    <li> good products, it make skin better.  and the price is good because we only use a small amount of the products. so it last long enough.    I hope the producer look at the complains and trying to solve the problems.  other than that it is a good products.  hopefully they also look at other products critics and improve it    good luck</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t expect this to be quite so strongly scented.  It goes around your eyes and mouth but the scent is so strong, it&#x27;s all I can smell and taste for an hour after I use it!</li>
    <li> This absorbs quickly and makes my skin smooth and soft.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is doing anything for lines and wrinkles, but I love the ingredients!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Repair Serum.  I guess the biggest is that it is all natural.  It has a low hazard rating from the cosmetic safety group at the Environmental Working Group.  It is a staple of my night-time routine and I think it works, too.</li>
    <li> I could not find this product in any of the retail stores in my area.  So I had to look for it online.  I always compare prices and research reviews before buying online.  This product did not let me down.  I love it and use it twice a day.  It smells amazing and really showed an improvement within a day.  You don&#x27;t need much, 1oz should last for a while.  I highly recommend.  Also, it comes from Amazon not a reseller on Amazon so you know you are getting the real thing.</li>
    <li> Love it!  VERY big bottle for the $ :)</li>
    <li> This is perfect for winter, too greasy for summer but it has really made a difference in my skin tone. Definitely less red bumps!</li>
    <li> Product is amazing! Works wonders everywhere, I even use it on my hair after washing and it can even make my coarse hair feel soft.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews and thought this might be pretty wonderful - but it&#x27;s really not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lavender scent is the only real thing that I like about it, since the oil gets everywhere and doesn&#x27;t appear to provide any exceptional benefits to my skin. Another reviewer suggested using the remainder as an eye makeup remover, but for me it seems too heavy for even that application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m just using it up on my body when I get out of the shower - no point in wasting it.</li>
    <li> Best for my kind of skin</li>
    <li> I love applying around my eyes. Great fragrance.  Quality product.  Perfect for natural skin care routine when you want some added moisture.</li>
    <li> i have been using this for a while and it really is a great product i have noticed a big difference in my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had troubled skin my entire life--oily, break-out prone, roscea-like symptoms. I brought things under control with some expensive products from spas, but I didn&#x27;t like having to rely on purchasing from one source.  On a whim I tried the travel pack from BB&#x27;s \\&quot;aging and sensitive skin line\\&quot; (do wish they&#x27;d rename it--my ego after all)and I love the way it makes my skin look. I use the serum followed by the marshmallow cream in the morning and at bedtime.  When I think of it I also use the rose-water toner.  The toner is great for tenage skin and my daughter, who has very sensitive delicate skin loves both the serum and the toner.  A couple of years ago I recommended it to a friend who has a classic irish complexion and is highly allergic. THe other day, I noticed what great skin she has and she told me she had taken me up on the recommendation.  Biggest problem with this product is that it can be difficult to find in stores that don&#x27;t stock a lot of Burts.</li>
    <li> I have been moving away from using face and body products with lots of chemicals (esp. petrochemicals) for the last year. This is by far the best I have found for my \\&quot;middle-aged winter skin.\\&quot; I use it on my face and neck daily. It has a definite eucalyptus odor at first, but that dissipates quickly. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> First time I ever used this it was a gift...lasted forever and I loved it...really felt like it was smoothing lines for me.  Glad to get myself some more.</li>
    <li> This could be a good product, but the smell doesn&#x27;t go away, it sticks around, yuck!  Try REN Omega 3 serum, it has all the good oils, but doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
    <li> Great product for dry skin</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I originally purchased it for my eyes but it was a little much for them.  It started to run into them at night and irritate them slightly.  I have since started using it on my neck and on target spots on my face (including on area about 1 inch below my eyes) I love it and my skin has looked better than it has in a long time.  Calmer and clearer.  The smell is wonderful.  I also use Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Eye Cream and am very happy with that product.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0009ET5O4 Burt&#x27;s Bees Repair Serum, 1-Ounce Bottle]]After spending a lot of money on over-hyped products, Burt&#x27;s Bees Repair Serum had been the only thing that soothes the eczema around my eyes, mouth and neck. I get terrible bouts of eczema during allergy season and this product has been the only thing that doesn&#x27;t sting my skin - and - makes it feel better. It relieves itching and burning upon contact. After allergy season is over and my eczema subsides, I&#x27;ll use it in the winter as a dry skin cure. A bottle lasts forever and it isn&#x27;t easy to find in New York. I really like the smell and don&#x27;t find it strong at all - as others have mentioned. I always have some around and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> I use this all of the time around my eye area. It is non-irritating and the bottle lasts forever</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this product was sold without a safety seal, as some cosmetic items are.  Unfortunately, the lid was not screwed on tight enough, and the oil had leaked and soaked into the package.  I expressed my concern to Amazon, and they were wonderfully helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as an eye treatment, but I have been also using it in my problem areas, and even as a thin layer of base under my lotion.  [I like the Burts Bees Radiance collection].  Surprisingly, using this serum on more of my face has not resulted in any pimples, which I would have expected since I was rubbing oil into my face.  This product works well with other Burts Bees products, which I appreciate for its stated ethical values and commitment to natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the BB Tomato Toner to deep clean areas with large pores [and have also been treating my husband - the pores on his nose are enormous!].  I feel like rubbing this Repair Serum into the areas I have prepared with the toner works out quite well.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. While thick on the face / wrinkles you can actually see immediate improvement. It takes a few weeks for the results to be constant / without a thick coating. I usually apply it in the evening after I get home from work once a day.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t find it special at all. Plain coconut or jojoba oil work much better for my skin.</li>
    <li> I cannot attest to the ability of this product to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles or its ability to support the restoration of skin.  What I can confirm are the fabulous moisturizing properties of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin and I break out easily.  I was wary of using something with so many different oils but I have not had any negative reactions while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing my face, I place a few drops on my finger and apply it over my entire face -- not just in the areas around my lips and eyes as suggested by the product description.  Then you wait a few minutes and apply your regular makeup.  I have had no problems with flaking skin (and makeup) and I live in the very cold Midwest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product lasts a good amount of time.  As noted previously, I apply it to my entire face and I do this in the morning and the evening.  I usually need a need bottle every five to six months.  $17 for a moisturizer that will last me six months, conquer my dry skin and won&#x27;t make me break out?!?  It is something you cannot afford not to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, this product does have a scent.  If you are sensitive to perfumes or other scents, you may want to see if you can find a store that carries this before buying so you can test it out.  Given the many natural oils in the product, I suppose it isn&#x27;t surprising that the smell makes me think of a wooded area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is made in the United States and not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> If oil serums work for you, then this serum is great. It&#x27;s reasonably priced and works the same if not better than the pricey Kiehl&#x27;s Midnight Recovery Serum [[ASIN:B003CHJ3Y2 Kiehl&#x27;s Midnight Recovery Concentrate, 1.0 oz., Full Size, New in Box]]. Do not put this oil on broken skin or it will sting and burn. I have sensitive excema skin. Unfortunately this serum was no miracle for me but it does hydrate more intensely than moisturizer.</li>
    <li> a lighter bottle will help while traveling</li>
    <li> I am 51yrs and having a fairly significant bout with hormonal acne. Big red pustules (water filled bumps the size of a pea)  and as 2 begin to diminish, 4 more pop up…sometimes in a matter of hours. Depressing. I take good care of myself and my skin and so frustration set in along with a desperate need for beauty products. With five huge bumps on my chin and days of other products to dry them out (even perscription) I just got fed up and put this stuff on. Within a few hours the bumps lost their swollenness and are now scabbing over and don&#x27;t hurt. It is really amazing and nothing else could be attributed to the change. I have had this acne enough times that I know the routine and how long it takes for them to calm down and heal. The leave a scar. I am at a lack of words for this product and for me $18 bucks is nothing compared to what I have spent and  I cannot believe how this is working. It is hard for me to type but I wanted to leave this note in case there is someone else who is suffering with adult acne the way I am…or was!</li>
    <li> Some people talk about this like the Holy Grail. It&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of use, my wrinkles have not magically disappeared. They are marginally less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make no mistake - this is an oil. Serum sounds better; but it&#x27;s oil. It smells like roses (Attar of Roses is listed as an ingredient). Some people find the smell objectionable but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros; My face is soft. I use it more heavily around my eyes 3 drops per eye and then spread it down onto my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It is not a &amp;#34;repair serum&amp;#34; it is an oil-based moisturizer. It&#x27;s good but it&#x27;s not magic.</li>
    <li> My skin broke out in pimples everywhere I used this. I felt like a teenager again! A little goes a loooong way so I tried using a tiny amount and still broke out. I guess it would be good for someone with very dry skin that never breaks out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s effective because after using it once I can&#x27;t stand the smell.  Not sweet or delicate, but incredibly strong/patchouli-like scent.  Yuck!  Sorry Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s, I love you, but your repair serum: I&#x27;m going to have to pass up.</li>
    <li> This oil smells wonderful and works very well on my hair also - it moisturizes it and helps with frizz.  It&#x27;s a fantastic product that I love and will definitely continue buying.</li>
    <li> I had a friend recommend this product to me, and after sampling it through her, I bought some myself. I absolutely love it and will continue to buy more! Keeps my skin soft and supple, smells nice, and it just feels really good on. Excellent stuff!</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews of several similar skin care products and decided to buy this one shown here. I was going on vacation and wanted something I could travel with. It is a good size to fit inside a make up bag. And is a nice smelling treat for your face!</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive and dry skin, which makes it really hard for me to find a facial product that does not irritate my face.  Most facial cream on the market would make my skin break and itch (e.g. red bumps like misquote bites) or does not moisture my skin enough.  I&#x27;ve tried other products that worked (Genes Vitamin E Creme), but wanted to try something new like a serum to see if it would improve my dry skin condition and perhaps repair the damage on my skin due to low humidity during winter.  After reading the reviews, I decided to give Burt&#x27;s Bees Repair Serum a try.  To my surprise, the serum is more of a essential oil texture (I expected something more liquid-like or gel-like), and it also has very strong scents that last about an hour or two, which makes me sneeze whenever I put it on.  The good news is that I didn&#x27;t get any break-out or red bumps, and the oil did a very decent job to keep my skin moisturize.  It does mess up my makeup a bit (eyeliner, particularly), but it really does the job to keep my skin healthy.  I also tried to mix the serum up with other skin products like Eucerine cream for my body and Genes Vitamin E Creme for my face.  The mix was great!  I will keep using this product for the winter.</li>
    <li> First off I have to say this oil has really been wonderful for my skin.  It moisturizes well after harsh astringents and soaks into skin quickly, meaning I can use it as a morning moisturizer and not have to worry about having greasy skin.  At first I used the serum as the package suggests.  I turned the bottle over on my ring finger and lightly dabbed it under my eyes and over the area crows feet develop as well as around my mouth.  After about 5 months the bottle looked barely used and being impressed with the results so far I started adding a few drops to my moisturizer.  I mix in two drops with whatever I happen to be using at the time (currently First Aid Beauty&#x27;s Ultra Repair Cream) and rub it over my whole face and neck.  Somehow it has reduced the size of my pores, helped stopped breakouts, and managed to kept me moisturized all day.  I really can&#x27;t recommend this enough to people like myself who have combination skin and need a deep moisturizer that won&#x27;t clog pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received this vial I was surprised by the size.  Judging from the picture on Amazon I thought it would be around the size of a perfume rollerball.  It ended up being 3 times as wide which at the time was a nice surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately eight months later I have slightly more than 1/3 left, but have noticed mold growing on the bottom of the bottle.  As this is pure oil I&#x27;m not surprised it has gone bad, but I don&#x27;t like having to waste the rest vial.  I think this would be a more successful item if they made it slightly smaller and reduced the price a bit. I use it twice a day around my eyes, mouth and forehead, and twice a day mixed in with my moisturizer (which is more than the packaging suggests) and it went bad before it was finished.  Bigger isn&#x27;t always better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - I&#x27;m updating this review approximately 2.5 months after I purchased my replacement bottle.  Upon receiving the new product I compared it to the spoiled one, and wow!  What a hugedifference.  Seeing the bright yellow new oil next to the almost clear spoiled one made me realize that the older one had actually gone bad much earlier than I had realized.  The color change (color change in oil indicates mold growth prior to spores we can see with the naked eye, so always watch out for it) happened so gradually I hadn&#x27;t noticed.  So this time I started using the oil completely on its own.  Instead of mixing it with moisturizer I dump 3-4 drops on my palms, rub them together to heat it up, and rub it across my whole face and neck.  It moisturizes beautifully and soaks in much quicker than you would think.  Still no problems with it clogging pores and causing breakouts. With this application twice a day the vial has lasted 2 and a half months which works out to about $1.40 a week.  Definitely worth the price to me.  I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Love it! The smell alone makes me put it on every day! It&#x27;s oil but rubs in nice and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel after it is rubbed in. My eyes do look a little brighter and younger but I&#x27;m also using the ageless eye cream from Burt&#x27;s as well.</li>
    <li> makes your face glow and soft but nothing more. I cant say I&#x27;m that impressed. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. I wanted something to hydrate the skin below my eyes, because sometimes they were dry in the morning which made my makeup cakey and enhanced any wrinkles in that area. Now I&#x27;ve noticed I don&#x27;t have that problem any more, because I use this serum at night. I was worried it may cause acne or clogged pores in the surrounding area, because I have acne-prone skin, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with that. In fact, I put some on a couple zits overnight and it seemed to calm the area. So, even though this is oily, it doesn&#x27;t seem to clog pores or cause acne. Now I just need to buy some face lotion with a higher SPF to put just around my eyes (my normal face lotion only has SPF 15 and I&#x27;m starting to get sun spots/freckles around my eyes). This bottle is huge and will last me for months and months. I just use my finger to dab it around my eyes (upper and lower).</li>
    <li> I like this product, because I am actively Burt&#x27;s bee customer, I love natural products,So this oil blend good  as a night ointment on my skin and during  winter,I applied all day,I dislike too much perfumery smell from lavender, I wish to have  light smell on my natural skin care products.Hope this product keep me looking much younger with good looking without any fine lines.</li>
    <li> I found that this serum was too heavy for my night time facial routine. It caused clogged pores. However, I started using it on my decollete and neck and my fine lines on between the breasts quickly went away. I use it every night now before bed in hope that the other lines disappear. They certainly hagent deepened which is a good thing. It has a pleasant smell and is affordable. Having a subscription saves even more money and is a convenient way to ensure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> It is the second time I am buying it. A must have during the winter; cold winds and home heaters just torture my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely reccomend</li>
    <li> The smell is not that bad, but you have to use a lot of product to see any results. Helps with really fine lines; no significant results on deeper lines.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a gift as Burt&#x27;s Bees products have a great reputation. The person I gifted it too did not like it as the smell was too strong. Gave it back to me, and I second that opinion. The smell of this product is EXTREMELY pungent. So much so that it&#x27;s unusable. I would love to use it as I think it would be a great repair serum, but neither of us can get past the smell. If you like pungent rose smell, you&#x27;ll probably LOVE this product. I always say, to each their own.</li>
    <li> After one week, I can&#x27;t say conclusively that I&#x27;ve seen any difference. However, it smells divine, and it hasn&#x27;t made me break out or anything. I&#x27;m young (26), but just beginning to notice wrinkles on my forehead and smile lines between my mouth and nose, so I want to try to avoid those from getting deeper as soon as I can. This serum has really good reviews in that respect, so maybe I just need to use it for more than a week! I use it twice a day, so I will update my review in some time if I notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: 5/5/14&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;ve used this for some time now, and I reduced my review to 3 stars. The smell is great, and it&#x27;s not super greasy. It soaks into my skin very quickly. However, it&#x27;s done zip for my few fine lines. I haven&#x27;t seen a single difference.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a less expensive serum than I had been using. I have combination/sensitive/acne-prone skin and I had heard borage oil could be helpful and after extensive search I found this. It has borage oil, though not a main ingredient. This has not caused any breakouts. This does not feel oily, unless you use too much. I find I just need the bare amount to give my skin the moisture it needs without it being too oily, so this should last a while. The instructions say to put it around mouth and eyes, but I use it everywhere with my daily moisturizer/SPF on top of it and I think it has made my skin look brighter and clearer.</li>
    <li> I  was told of this product by a friend of mine who had remarkable results after using the serum.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it does the same for the areas around my eyes and above my lips.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell of it, but if it works then I won&#x27;t let the odor bother me.</li>
    <li> This product was a gift to me and I truly believe that this is a wonder serum.  When I get a blemish, chapped lips, and any other irritated area; I use this oil on the spot and it starts healing within hours.  The area will heal within a day or two.  This product feels very oily on your fingers, but once it is on your skin, it absorbs immediately into the skin and there is NO oily surface.  I also use this on my dogs winter nose that cracks and chaps; the dog is not crazy about the application, but it helps heal his nose immensely.  I would like to keep this produce a secret, so it is all mine; but that would be unfair.  This serum is not expensive and lasts for, well, I had a bottle for over 2 years before having to buy another.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I used this treatment at night before going to bed. I am not sure at this time if it is helping or not with dark circles under my eyes. I use this at night because of the strong aroma.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years under my eyes at night.  It is wonderful and keeps that area smooth and hydrated.  It&#x27;s great on any fine lines on your face and does actually work.  I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Repair Serum and would encourage Burt&#x27;s Bees to NEVER discontinue it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great in colorado with those dry days...I use it at night before my mosturizer and it absorbs and has improved my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the first product that actually rid my son of psoriasis on his wrists!  The creams &amp; lotions specifically made for treatment did not help.  This product is great!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes after reading the reviews, but I&#x27;m not impressed with this product.  I have to strongly disagree with reviewers who say this is as good as Decleor.  Decleor neroli serum had a very noticeable brightening effect on my skin (alas, broke me out too).  Burt&#x27;s Bees Repair Serum  kind of sits on my skin.  It helps with dryness but I didn&#x27;t notice anything like an anti-aging or brightening effect.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see apparent difference in my fine wrinkles and it&#x27;s extremely oily. I can&#x27;t put anything else on after I put this one on, because it&#x27;s too greasy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews just when it&#x27;s really bad or really good. This serum really works! I wasn&#x27;t the one who noticed my wrinkles around my eyes but my sister so I panicked and started looking for anti-aging or repair serum that has the highest stars... I&#x27;ve been using this ever since I bought every night ( I rarely missed a night) and now it&#x27;s close to a year after using it, my best friend told me that I don&#x27;t have those ugly wrinkles now. I stopped checking after a month of using it when i started because it felt really slow but now after more than 6 months seeing the result, I am so happy and satisfied. Of course like any other product/medicine you have to be compliant for it work, that is if you are determined to erase those ugly wrinkles!</li>
    <li> I received this product quickly and have only been using it for a day but I love it!&lt;br /&gt;It smells great and makes my face feel smooth and look healthier.  I would definitely reccomend it!</li>
    <li> My wife tried it for a few times--being the trooper she is--but she could not get used to the burning sensation around the eyes. If the serum had actually worked, I would have given it more than 1 star.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, even with all the positive reviews about this product. When it comes to anti-aging products, or skin products in general which claim to transform your skin, it is a frustrating game to find something that actually works, and usually you&#x27;re paying a hefty price to see those \\&quot;results.\\&quot;    Recently I became a Burt&#x27;s Bees fanatic, literally in the past week. My bathroom is now stocked with various Burt&#x27;s products from the Cranberry &amp; Pomegranate Sugar Scrub, Herbal Blemish Stick, Soap Bark and Chamomile Deep Cleanser, Milk and Honey Lotion, Royal Jelly Eye Cream, Carrot Nutritive Day Creme and more... I&#x27;ve been impressed with all these products, which now leads me to the Repair Serum.    Let me first start by saying that I am 26 so I don&#x27;t have any deep wrinkles, or really any wrinkles for that matter aside from a few fine lines developing under my eyes from smiling/laughing (I want to stop them from permanently forming in my skin). I don&#x27;t smoke, or drink (neither alcohol or coffee), I wear sunscreen daily 50-60+ SPF... I got this product simply as a preventative measure. I wanted to try a basic formula at first, even though they have an anti-aging and Radiance line which seem to be targeted towards anti-aging... I figure those would be appropriate for mature skin and those who have already developed deep wrinkles.     I also have very acne prone, sensitive skin. I wanted to go the natural route because for years I have been using acne products on my face and those products either did nothing or caused an irritation so bad to my skin that I had an allergic reaction.    All I had to go by were the reviews. Each website I visited only had positive things to say about this product and I thought, \\&quot;I&#x27;ll try it, and it if doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ll try another Burt&#x27;s product.\\&quot; I honestly had back-ups. I even have a list of more expensive alternatives if this didn&#x27;t give me the results I was hoping for which was to diminish any fine lines which I may be developing...and hopefully not clog my pores and make me breakout.    I received my bottle yesterday in my Burt&#x27;s Bees haul. The first thing I noticed is that is does have a very oily consistency. Immediately I worried that once I put this on my face, even the smallest amount, that part of my face would break out in a rash or irritate my pimples. Not so. Yes, it does go on quite oily so you have to be careful with applying. A small amount goes a long way and if you massage the serum into your skin thoroughly it&#x27;s not quite as heavy. What I do is I dab a bit at a time on my finger, and I apply small dots on my face where I want to prevent wrinkles; between my eyebrows, under my eyes and around my nose and mouth. Then I start to gently blend the serum outwards so that it covers my entire face, and I do very gentle circular motions to blend it all into my skin. As I said, use only a minimal amount because it takes awhile to absorb.    What I also noticed was the smell. It has a very heavy scent to it... to me it smells like the lavender overpowers it. Basically, I don&#x27;t care for the scent, similar to the Herbal Blemish stick which has a high odor to it, it&#x27;s something that I don&#x27;t care for but thankfully the scent fades relatively quickly. If you are overly sensitive to strong scents however, perhaps you want to try a different product. I figure if this product does what it claims, I can live with the scent because it does fade within a few minutes.    I top the serum off by using the Beeswax and Royal Jelly Eye Cream under my eye. I also intend to use a moisturizing lotion on top the serum to lock it all in since it has such vital nutrients, and also to give me additional benefits.    The results: I have used this serum a total of one night and was not expecting to see the benefits of this product for 2-4 weeks. What I got were literally overnight results. The one thing which surprised me most of all, is that the serum with all its vitamins seemed to help clear up some small breakouts I had on my face. Now, I deal with the occasional blemish, I don&#x27;t have severe acne but it seems like just as one blemish is healing, another appears, and even if I leave it alone, it still leaves a mark on my face after its gone. My acne seemed to have healed about 40% just in one use of this product, and that wasn&#x27;t even what I got this product for. So for that, the fact that I was expecting to wake up to clogged pores and MORE blemishes, and actually got clearer skin, I am impressed. It could be the serum along with use of the Herbal Blemish Stick that helped regardless, I enjoy the results. I will have to see in a few weeks if it diminishes any post acne scars as a few here have claimed this serum does.    Fine lines. As I said, it&#x27;s not like I have massive creases in my skin... even with my fine lines, I would just prefer to take care of them before they settle into my skin. In my one night of using this serum, I woke up and found that these fine lines had been softened. I had one by my mouth when I smile which is nearly invisible now. I really can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin will look like in one week if these are the results I get in just one night.    If you are looking for something heavier to work on deeper lines and other anti-aging concerns, look into their Radiance line or their Naturally Ageless line. The featured negative review stated they were disappointed that this serum didn&#x27;t \\&quot;brighten\\&quot; their skin... This product claims to heal skin, not brighten it. If you want a brightening product, look into the Radiance Eye Creme, Day Creme or Night Creme... that whole line is designed specially to brighten your face. It&#x27;s funny to me that people complain a product doesn&#x27;t do a certain thing meanwhile, they bought the wrong product. Also try the Carrot Nutritive Day Creme or Night Creme because it contains beta-carotene, the product is very sweet-smelling however so take note if you do have a sensitive nose.    All-in-all I can say that I am very impressed. This product may be better suited for younger skin or those who do not yet have the severe signs of aging to their skin. Using this serum as a preventative measure is what seems to work best. Just like any anti-wrinkle cream, if you already have wrinkles, it&#x27;s harder to reverse them as opposed to catching them when you see the first signs.</li>
    <li> i hope it has effect..</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LoVE, Love Burt&#x27;s Bees Healthy Treatment Repair Serum.  I used Kiehl&#x27;s Recovery Concentrate and loved it. Tried this Burt&#x27;s Bees because of the price and I am so glad I did!!!  I love the scent and the feel of the serum.  It feels so luxurious. I put it on and night and I can really see a difference in the texture and radiance of my skin--face and neck.  I don&#x27;t see why I&#x27;d every use anything else.</li>
    <li> I received this repair serum as a gift and was pleasantly surprised.  There were no overnight miracles, but over time, I started to notice that the fine lines around my eyes really seemed to be looking better.  I liked it so much, that I ordered a second bottle when my first ran out.  I don&#x27;t want to be without this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no heavy odors with this serum and it goes on a bit oily, but is absorbed quickly.</li>
    <li> I had one of these vials in my drawer for 3 years and didn&#x27;t use it much. then I recently got into essential oils and learned what the ideal combo of EO and carrier oils was for my skin. Lucky me - I already had them - in this vial!  It looks small online but it&#x27;s actually pretty big. I&#x27;ve been using 1 vial for 4 months for both cleansing and hydrating and I still have some left. Bought another one. I&#x27;m replacing all my expensive creams and serums with this magic bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a while. The smell is very strong and it sometimes burns my eyes. As for my skin, I have not noticed any change at all with this product and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll finish using the container.</li>
    <li> It smells nice, but didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in fine lines or skin tone. I&#x27;ve moved on to other products.</li>
    <li> I like the scent its just a little oily but does seem to blend into skin well.</li>
    <li> Very nice product and has worked very well on my face so far. Smells great and the bottle is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Feeling moist, anointed in the face, but also the fact that I now pumui flavor too good.&lt;br /&gt;Flavor stifling iteulsu but I too love the flavor of the oil products.</li>
    <li> I have the type of eyes that always have those little wrinkles under them.  I had wrinkles under them as a kid.  I hate it, but there&#x27;s not much I can do about it.  However, as I get older, I feel like they look worse, especially if I am dehydrated.  I wasn&#x27;t really even looking for this product, but I was skimming through other beauty products and came across this and the reviews were so compelling I figured I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a fan of some of Burt Bee&#x27;s products (like that cuticle wax stuff, and the lip balms) but other things have been kind of mediocre.  So I felt pretty objective when I tried this.  My initial impressions were that you get a lot of product for your money. This vial is BIG!  It&#x27;s 2-3 times the size of other beauty oils I&#x27;ve purchased. The jar is very attractive too, which is always a fun bonus.  And a little really goes a long way.  I have been using this stuff for over a month now and the oil is still at the top of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell was really nice, though some may consider it a bit strong for something going on their face.  I enjoy it though.  I applied this oil under my eyes before bed and was genuinely surprised and pleased by its effectiveness.  The next morning I could see a visible difference, and how often can you REALLY admit that when you try a beauty product? While nothing will get rid of the eye wrinkles genetics gave me, the skin was much smoother and looked more hydrated.  I was really pleased.  This stuff has become part of my regular routine and I use it on my whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure this vial will last months, and it&#x27;s very reasonably priced.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but it really works to reduce the wrinkles around the eyes.  I didn&#x27;t like the smell at first but now its ok.  It lasts forever too.</li>
    <li> My go to for bug bites, rashes and helping the final healing stages of cuts and abrasions.</li>
    <li> I like Burt&#x27;s Bees products. I thought this would be better. It is kind of runny and feels oily long after applying. Would not buy again</li>
    <li> i put this around my eyes every day, day and night. it&#x27;s really soft, but you need to be careful not to get too close to your eyes. i apply it on the little wrinkles around my eyes. it doesn&#x27;t make them disappear, but it feels good for my skin and it makes it softer and brighter (or so i feel)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell whether products like this actually do anything, but this smells fantastic, and it seems to help with lines around my eyes and forehead. Didn&#x27;t make me break out, either, although I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the positive reviews &amp; the natural ingredient; however, it&#x27;s too sticky even i used only tiny for my entire face.  I tried it only twice in two consecutive nights, and I still can&#x27;t stand the sticky feeling on my face.  So I returned it next day.  I have been using many different kinds of serum (fr dept stores / drug stores), i think the royal jolly makes it sticky or too rich for me.  it may be a great product if the weight is not that heavy.  BB becomes my favor since I want to use natural product to my skins.</li>
    <li> amazing stuff with an excellent shipping,you can used it for any dry area in your face or body.the smell is awesome &amp; made me feel that im in the spa,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADVICE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;since it is oily avoid to apply it near the eyelashes,will make the vision soo blurry .</li>
    <li> I have allergies up the wazoo, could not keep using it.  :(</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Smells so therapeutic and absorbes well. I used it only at night though.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products. This one made my face a bit dry, however, so I use it some but rely on my generic eye serum and face moisturizer more.</li>
    <li> This oil?serum? is amazing!! I didn&#x27;t expect it works that much! I use this one after toner. My skin has been smooth,soft and no redness since I started using this. Usually I get dry and damage skin in autumn,and it takes for while to recover. But I didn&#x27;t get such a damage skin this autumn. Great product!</li>
    <li> My skin tends to be on the drier side so this oil doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. But the smell is a bit strong but it isn&#x27;t unpleasant. Some people might find the smell a bit too strong though.</li>
    <li> After using Burt&#x27;s Bees Healthy Treatment Repair Serum for about a week and a half I started to develop large bumps under the skin where I applied it. The bumps are scattered together into little clumps on my eyelid, near the corner of my eye and in the darkest spot of my under-eye. They get pretty itchy. I have sensitive skin so this may not be a fair assessment of the serum but the bumps are pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;m not purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this oil! I have tried all kinds of skin treatments, from serums to lotions and nothing has worked better for my skin than this. After just a few days of using it I saw my skin looking healthier. My fine lines were less noticeable and I was getting compliments like I&#x27;ve never gotten before. I put it all over my face, mostly around my eyes and around my mouth. It is an oil so expect it to be oily for awhile as it takes a bit to absorb into your skin. Although it stays oily for a bit, your skin does not look oily and it never makes me break out. I love how natural this treatment is and it really works!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. The smell takes a bit to get used to. It&#x27;s very oily (as expected); however, it left my skin feeling soft and supple in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin, you should be wary of this product. I&#x27;m pretty sure I developed an allergy to this because after a few weeks of using it, I would get these weird little bumps on my face. They weren&#x27;t pimples or blemishes - they looked like hives with no itchiness. They stayed for a week or two and resolved, but my skin would get very flakey because of them. I tried using it again after the hive things resolved to see if it could help with the dryness, but they just came back. Thinking it was just the cold weather or something, I went back to my old moisturizer, and everything was fine. A month or two afterwards, I tried this again, and lo and behold the hives came back. I haven&#x27;t used this for like 6 months now, and these bumps have been nonexistent. I&#x27;m convinced this product caused them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To put things in context: I am not one to get allergies - I&#x27;m not allergic to anything except this product (not pollen, animal dander, or even dust). I&#x27;m 22 with -very- minimal acne (I get like 3 pimples in a year) looking for some mild preventative skin treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tl;dr: It works decently well, but watch out if you&#x27;re prone to allergies.</li>
    <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees repair serum for 4 days and this affect is better than I can probably do it justice here. I am 29 and have had breakouts constantly since about 13. I have NEVER had a product work like this one. I have oily skin and normally do not like using products with oil let alone an actual oil like this one. I scheduled a facial (which I don&#x27;t do very often) and I knew if I went in there without having been moisturizing my skin, I would get a lecture. I did not buy this to help my breakouts, I bought it to sort of pretreat my skin so during the facial, it would be easy to extract the blackheads. I did read the reviews here first and saw the one where the girl said it helped her breakouts a bit and that made me buy this one instead of other repair serums, that and the price. The first night, I used it on my face (I like the smell too.) The next morning, I didn&#x27;t notice much difference but used it again and then again in the evening. After about 48 hours and using it about 4 times, I thought I started to notice my face actually being LESS oily during the day and my breakouts healing. But I thought, surely I&#x27;m just imagining this. The 3rd day I was raving to my best friend and boyfriend and using it on my back and shoulders where I also breakout and lower inner and back of my thighs where I have bumpy skin. So after 4 days, I&#x27;m one fifth through this miracle serum but that is only because I love it so much and I am so happy about the improvement of my face I could cry. I have been waiting for my breakouts to stop for 16 years. Last year, feeling defeated, I finally figured, well, I&#x27;m pushing 30, this is going to be a lifelong thing. Now I think.. maybe.. using this product will clear up my skin completely except for one blemish here or there, not like now(well last week) where my forehead had probably 30 small red bumps and my cheeks were similar and on my neck under my jaw I had probably 10 whitehead pimples on each side with at least one or two whitehead pimples somewhere on my face at any given time with the summer being the time of the year when my face looked the worst. I think my next bottle of this stuff will last a lot longer, probably 2 to 3 months when I am just using it after showers instead of using it about 3 times a day and almost pouring it all over me now. I&#x27;m just so excited and I want my face to finish clearing up! : D I wish I had before and after photos to show you all. This stuff is so amazing and I am so grateful to have stumbled upon it. I was an off and on user of proactiv, now my only product will be this and an exfoliator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Thanks a bazillion to Burt&#x27;s Bees for making this product.

    <li> I was given this as a gift.  I never thought I would use any OIL on my face, even if I am 40.  I tried this after I had had a cold.  My nose was all red and chapped.  My moisturizer and even lip balm burned like the dickens.  So I tried this.  It did not burn and helped me heal up quickly.  I now use it twice daily around my eyes under moisturizer and on lips under balm.  It help keep me from getting so dry in those areas in the very dry climate I live in.  Give it a shot I think its great stuff.</li>
    <li> Excellent serum! Truly moisturizes skin! It has a very heavy oil texture so i use it at night right before my face cream and next morning my skin is fabulously soft and hydrated!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine suggested I get this product as I have sensitive, dry skin.  It is a light soothing oil that feels great on my face.  I love that it does not feel heavy.  It is an oil so be sure to use it at night on clean skin.</li>
    <li> When I read the word serum I though it could be  pretty light and smooth like other serums but this ones is oily, heavier and I smells funny I do not really feel comfortable smelling it for awhile after I apply it, I got it because I read good reviews and now I hope it works.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my eyelids, because they tend to get dry and flaky which makes makeup look horrible. It works excellently and has a pleasant herbal smell. I haven&#x27;t had any flakiness whatsoever since I started using it 3 months ago. A little goes a long way, and since I only use this only eyes, I&#x27;ll have this bottle for a long time to come.  This is better for nighttime use. If you use it in the morning, it might not agree with your makeup, since it&#x27;s straight oil.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  It imparts a light, floral scent which makes application a pleasant experience.  Just a little dab of serum goes a long way and it is effective in getting rid of dry and red patches on my face.  Despite the various oils in the list of ingredients, this product does not clog my pores at all.  Now that I&#x27;m pregnant, I also use this serum on my tummy to minimize and prevent further stretch marks and so far it is working well (plus it provides soothing relief for itchy, stretched out pregnant belly).  And for the price, this is such a tremendous value!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I use this around eyes mostly - does not irritate eyes -  also use around lips, back of hands - just a few drops goes a long ways - seems to improve ski n -  this is my second bottle - will continue to reorder</li>
    <li> Aging and this winter have taken a toll on my skin.  I switch to Burt&#x27;s Bees products, including the serum, and am extremely pleased with the results.  I apply the serum under the night moisturizer and in the morning mix a couple of drops with my daytime moisturizer.  The result has been amazing.  Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because Burt&#x27;s products are usually great. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not great for around the eyes, just don&#x27;t get it in them. It burns the inside of the eye because if your not super careful when you put it around the eye, it&#x27;s a serum and can run into the eye.</li>
    <li> Also reveiwed the rose toner. This stuff helped me get thru a nasty skin infection I picked up in basic training with no scars. Wonderful.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased it, just because of very good reviews. Burst bees makes your skin so soft but it itches so bad even after I stop using it.</li>
    <li> I thought all Burt&#x27;s Bees products have bee products in it. This one has none. My mom says it&#x27;s too oily.</li>
    <li> product is fine but packaging poor because there was leakage--I almost sent it back for a replacement but did not take the time</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle worker.  I had some really bad sunspots on my face.  Big ol&#x27; gross looking blotches.  I have tried many expensive products and nothing worked.  Exfoliating my skin and putting this stuff on afterwards, I have noticed a DRAMATIC difference in the darkness of my spots.  Burt&#x27;s Bees is awesome</li>
    <li> The delicate skin surrounding my eyes gets drier as time passes.  I&lt;br /&gt;tried this repair serum and find it is immediately comforting and takes&lt;br /&gt;away that leathery feeling.  I use it around my eyes and mouth to prevent&lt;br /&gt;the formation of lines.  My face feels much like it did years ago.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now. At last I&#x27;ve found a facial oil that doesn&#x27;t clog up my sensitive skin. This is great for just around the eyes - as per the instructions, but I often use it over my whole face, or I sometimes add a couple of drops to my moisturiser or hand cream too. It lasts for ages as you need to use so little each time.</li>
    <li> Like this a lot. Love the scent.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to make any difference re: fine lines.... thick serum</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years, love the smell and how it makes my skin feel without being too oily.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time, very happy w/ it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 39 and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of different brands of skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;My skin type is combined ( dry and oily) and very sensitive to anything.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this with facial cream ( mixing together) before bed for a month, and the result is incredible.&lt;br /&gt;All the pimples, white heads and flaky dead skins are gone and my skin is smoothest and healthiest in my life.&lt;br /&gt;I only wish if I&#x27;d known it earlier!</li>
    <li> I am SO glad I stumbled across this little bottle of oil.  This oil is filled with essential oils that the skin just soaks right up! The key to using this essential oil is to dab on the face fresh out of the shower when your face is still moist.  After 2-3 days of use, any acne pustules are healed due to antibacterial properties.  Also you may notice any whiteheads coming to the surface.  Because the oil is lubricating the pore and bringing out any dead skin cells and accumulated sebum to the surface, pores eventually get smaller as they are drained of gunk.&lt;br /&gt;My husband began using this as well and has also noticed clearer skin.&lt;br /&gt;The essential oils have an earthy lavender smell which is stronger and quickly dissipates within 10 minutes.  Because the oil is so light and compatible with skin, it does not leave an oily sheen.&lt;br /&gt;If you use it on dry skin instead of after a warm shower or warm face wash then it may sit on top of skin as any cream would.&lt;br /&gt;For reference my skin is oily in some areas, dry in others.  Very easily irritated and turns red.  Small bumps under skin in certain area with whiteheads and breaks out weekly (well, not since I have been using this oil).&lt;br /&gt;Hope this was helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Attar of Rose, known for its moisturizing properties&lt;br /&gt;• Formulated with 11 essential natural botanicals&lt;br /&gt;• Green Tea Extract helps to fight free radical damage&lt;br /&gt;• Borage and Evening Primrose Oils add natural essential fatty acids&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS: rosa canina (rosehip) seed oil, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, lavandula angustifolia (lavender) oil, tocopheryl acetate, oenothera biennis (evening primrose) oil, borago officinalis (borage) seed oil, triticum vulgare (wheat) germ oilcorylus americana (hazelnut) seed oil, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange/neroli) flower oil, rosa damascena (rose) flower oil, calendula officinalis flower extract, camellia sinensis (green tea) leaf extract, beta-carotene, tocopherol, ascorbyl palmitate retinyl palmitate</li>
    <li> My wife likes it and quickly helps any cut to heal faster. She prefers to use Berts bees product. I know that if this runs out she will buy more</li>
    <li> love this! I use it all over my face am and pm.</li>
    <li> i started using this about 1 yr ago and like it.  i am 52 yrs old, am italian so do not have dry skin.  it absorbs well.  it does have a slight smell to me but it goes away within minutes.  i use it on all my wrinkles before my face and eye creams.</li>
    <li> It really does seem to help repair minor scarring and fine lines, especially around the eyes and mouth, as intended by the product. What I dislike is the strong smell of the oil - I think it&#x27;s the Ylangylang. I might just go back to some nicer-smelling essential oils after I use this up.</li>
    <li> This is my third time to buy this stuff. I am only 22 so I don&#x27;t need to use it for wrinkles. I only use it at night, not every night. It is just oil, not easy to absorb. But it is natural and will not harm my skin. Everytime I used it, my skin is soft and shiny in the morning. That&#x27;s why I like it so much!</li>
    <li> Great product! Love it! Good package too! It keeps my skin moisturized and fresh looking. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> what a great product this is, been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Repair Serum is very good for individuals with dry skin or that live in a very dry climate.  It goes right into the skin and softens and moisturizes.  I will definitely use this product every day.</li>
    <li> So far I have used this product for 2 weeks and it feel nice and I like the scent.  I use it sparingly as it is an oil, but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This stuff has lasted me FOREVER! It works great as preventative maintenance.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this serum and I like that I can use it as a man. It&#x27;s very effective. Keeps my skin looking young and feeling supple and smooth.</li>
    <li> Minimizes my pores, and helps my under eye circles/bags/crows feet with ONE use. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Why put separate natural oils on your skin - when they&#x27;re all in one little bottle.  Like 10 different ones. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and the glowing reviews of this product inspired me to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting a miracle serum based on the reviews but unfortunately, it just didn&#x27;t happen. I dabbed it under my eyes nightly for a couple of weeks. It has a pleasant smell and absorbs into the skin nicely, but I just didn&#x27;t see much of a difference after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did start to break out in my under eye region, a problem I&#x27;ve never had before with previous eye creams. This coupled with the lack of any real, noticeable results was enough to make me stop using it. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become a huge fan of using oil to moisturize, so I was excited to try this. As an undereye moisturizer, I find that it travels too easily and makes my eyes water. My eye area isn&#x27;t super dry, though, so it just doesn&#x27;t soak in very well. Because of this, it did nothing to smooth my skin or make it feel more hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I use it all over my face (alternating nights with a retinol/night cream combo). It works fine, but no better than pure jojoba oil. Again, this \\&quot;serum\\&quot; for some reason just doesn&#x27;t easily sink into my skin -- whereas my face absorbs jojoba oil so well that I can even use it in the morning and not feel greasy during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed -- I was really eager to try this, but it seems that I should just stick with what works.</li>
    <li> I am 34 years old, and have started noticing some fine lines on my face and décolletage. I live in a very humid environment in the south and have combination skin so I have always been a little reluctant to try any kind of oils on my face during the warmer months. (I love burt&#x27;s bees orange essence cleanser in the winter). I bought this based on the amazon reviews and price. The first week, I noticed some bumps around my eyes, but my skin was looking better so I kept using it. Now I am on week 4 and I absolutely LOVE it. No more bumps, just smooth, vibrant skin. I also use it on my neck and décolletage. I will use this for as long as it is available!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never use this serum before .but i&#x27;d said it does a good job .I used it for my eyes ,see .i&#x27;m20 years younger now</li>
    <li> havent seen any result . its ok to use when you have a vey dry skin and want to put something on that not too gressy but beside that it is useless</li>
    <li> I have used Burt&#x27;s Bees Repair Serum every night for about 5 years.  Not to be vain, but my skin has hardly aged between age 50 and 55.  (I do try to live a healthy lifestyle as well.)  I have always had dry skin, so dabbing this oil on problem spots, letting it soak in and then putting an inexpensive drugstore night cream over it has been a good routine for me.  Because is it all natural, the oil will start to go rancid after being open for 6-8 month, so don&#x27;t be stingy and use it liberally on your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate being able to buy this repair serum on Amazon because it can be hard to find in stores and the price is so much better here.  Burt&#x27;s Bees makes another serum that I haven&#x27;t tried, but the repair serum is the one that is all natural botanical oils.  Can you tell I love this stuff?</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s a small bottle -- a little goes a long way.  It has a nice feel to it -- not too greasy -- and goes on easily.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> First of all, this product consists of ten kinds of oil (one of which is vegetable oil), so calling it a serum is a misnomer to me, as I have come to associate serum with a creamy opaque texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, this is very moisturizing since you are basically putting a layer of oil onto your face, much like how one would put in a layer of oil into a pan before cooking.  So naturally this is not drying - but just like any other type of oil, it feels greasy unless you put very very little on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third - and maybe this is the reason why Burt&#x27;s Bees doesn&#x27;t make this product available at any major retailers (Target, Safeway, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Whole Foods, etc.) - the smell is strong.  So strong that my bf asked me what that smell was when I started applying it (I already put on another layer of cream which already has its own perfume and sort of covered up this oil&#x27;s smell).  It&#x27;s not an offending smell, but it does take some getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read in a lot of reviews that this product does miracles for a lot of people, but unfortunately I have yet to see this on my face.  Or any dramatic difference.  I bought this because it doesn&#x27;t contain any parabens (which I am allergic to) or other synthetic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is good if you are looking for a really moisturizing oil for your face - but if you are looking for a serum in the traditional sense, you may need to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> CAN&#x27;T FIND THIS IN STORES FOR SOME REASON...I PUT ON MY EYE LIDS AND AREA OF EYE WHERE THEY SEEM TO GET DRY AND FLAKY, DUE I THINK TO EYE MAKE UP.  WENT TO A DERMATOLOGIST YEARS AGO...SHE SUGGESTED ALL SORTS OF THINGS TO TRY...ONE NOT WEARING MAKE UP TO WORK AND SLOWLY INCORPORATING.  UMMMM NO!  THIS DOES THE TRICK FOR ME.  PUT A LIGHT COAT ON, YOU  DON&#x27;T WANT IT IN YOUR EYES OR BLURRY VISION, BUT IT GOES AWAY.  MY GO TO!</li>
    <li> I like to use this serum around my eyes and lips.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing for healing dry, flaky skin. Put it on at night before bed and wake up with baby soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a little odd, but goes away after a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my brother&#x27;s girlfriend. she likes very much and though this product helping her skin to be better than before.</li>
    <li> all time favorite facial hydrating and rejuvenating product. i love this rose combination.</li>
    <li> Feels really good on your skin and soaks in real quick, I use it as a night oil. I love the smell too, but I don&#x27;t see any results or change in my skin texture.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! You can see a difference in moisture and the lessening of wrinkles but give it time.</li>
    <li> I have always had a difficult time sleeping. My tiny cranium just won&#x27;t stop when I close my eyes.  I had used a product on and off that worked  but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. So my hunt began.  After much reseaching I bought three products-Badgers, Lavender spritz and Burts Bees&#x27;.  All of these have many of the same properties.  By far Burts Bee Repair Serum is the definite winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it around my eyes, on my lips and on my temples before I go to sleep.  I don&#x27;t even remember falling to sleep and since I have been using this , not once have I gotten up in the middle of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a Repair Serum, too early to tell but I didn&#x27;t purchase this for that reason.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Just bought this serum expecting to get my skin more moisture and the big surprise comes when you don&#x27;t expect at all! What a great surprise for a awesome price!!! This product not only leaves the skin super moisture without felling greese but also after first application I notice a considerable reduction on my pores and also is sort of lightening my acne marks. Absolutely loved this product!!! Highly recommend, very high quality and totally natural product, it couln&#x27;t be better than this!</li>
    <li> I had horrendous stinging in my eyes because of this oil. Generally I use products(other oils) under my eyes because moisturizing is key at my age (22) and two days in a row it burned my eyes like acid. So even though it says that on the box, DO NOT PUT THIS PRODUCT AROUND YOUR EYES. I have no allergies either? But otherwise it did help even out my complexion, and I always love oils for leaving the skin plump and soft. I particularly like this one because its a little heavier so it keeps my skin a little more hydrated than the NUXE luxury oil. I use 10% benzoyl peroxide so I need to counteract the dryness with this and its great</li>
    <li> This is the only product that seem to control the appearance bumps and itchiness on my maturing face. I&#x27;ve gone to quite a dermatologists (told me I had rosacea, or stress dermatitis, contact dermatitis , you name it i heard it)  and spent tons of money on laser genesis and other treatments. I was initially afraid that it will cause my face to breakout because it seem pretty oily/heavy but I think the opposite has happened. If I ran out of it or forgot to put it on in the morning then by night time - ugh! I highly recommend trying this product.</li>
    <li> When I opened this product, I was a little worried. It&#x27;s basically an oil, and I have acne-prone skin. I bought it to use around my eyes, though, so I just did my best to keep it away from my problem areas. Within a week, I noticed a difference in the lines under my eyes. Now this is no replacement for plastic surgery, but I can&#x27;t think of another product that has actually changed the appearance of my fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed that I tried a little on my forehead. I expected to wake up with some new acne, but nothing happened! So I tried it on the rest of my face. After a few days, I realized this serum wouldn&#x27;t make me break out. So I kept using it, and I&#x27;ve seen a difference all over my face. Even the smile lines next to my mouth, which are deeper than my eye lines, seem to be improving. Most of all, my skin feels moist and healthy, but not oily! (I don&#x27;t think this has helped my acne in any way, FYI. It just hasn&#x27;t exacerbated it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have complained about the scent, but I don&#x27;t mind it. In fact, I find it a little soothing. If you can&#x27;t stand the smell of tea tree oil, this might not be the right product for you--it reminds me of that scent. Others have complained about burning eyes, but I haven&#x27;t experienced that. Do NOT put ANY cream right up next to your eyeballs! Keep creams at the edge of your eye socket--they will spread to the rest of the eye area. Leave a healthy bit of room around your eyes, or just about any cream will irritate you.</li>
    <li> I needed a night time serum, and heard good things about this one, and I have always used natural or organic products for my sensitive skin. I have been using it for abou three weeks now, and I have noticed a slight difference in my dark circles. I love how much you get for the price, it is a pretty big vial. And the smell is amazing! It is earthy and rose at the same time. It is a thicker serum, which is really good for nighttime use. My skin is noticeably softer, wherever I put it. But I was hoping for a more dramatic change in my under eye circles, as far as clearing up how dark they can get. But with more time and daily use I think I could see more improvement. But I do see a decrease in crows feet and smaller wrinkles!</li>
    <li> I purchased Burt&#x27;s Bees Repair Serum as a daytime under eye moisturizer.  Unfortunately, it did a much better job of removing my mascara.  I looked like a raccoon by the end of the day until I figured out it was Burt.  It is ok as a night moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Fabulous smell, very effective and pure.</li>
    <li> Use this on my face...love the smell, skin remains soft and smooth...to soon to tell its true benefits.  I do like the cost and that it can be purchased at my local Acme or Walgreens.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and goes on silky smooth, does not leave an oily residue and does not make my sensitive skin breakout.  I thankfully don&#x27;t have darkened skin that needs lightening, but this serum is doing a great job of keeping the delicate under eye skin moisturized, looking healthy, and reducing the appearance of wrinkles.  I am a fan and plan on continuing to use this product indefinitely.</li>
    <li> it really makes my pore smaller after wearing it for the whole night.i use it during nights.it&#x27;s a bit oily during the day.</li>
    <li> love this! made my skin look great</li>
    <li> I use this on my face, around my eyes, and in my hair. There are so many different oils on the market but none are quite as multi-use as this one. So glad it is available for subscription!</li>
    <li> As always, the best.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took a while but patience is always good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this around my eyes and I have noticed much softer skin.  I was concerned about breakouts since it&#x27;s an oily product, but I have not had any issues with breakouts.  I read some of the reviews that said it was too runny to use around the eyes, but I just place a very small dot on my finger and it&#x27;s enough to cover the eye area underneath, the crows feets and the eye lid.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I am not a huge fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products. I LOVE that they are not tested on animals and comprised of naturally-sourced ingredients, but I just turned 29, so I am currently using a more targeted professional skincare regimen that my skin is really responding to. That said, I am sold on this oil!! I have found that since I moved to Colorado regular moisturizers just don&#x27;t cut it on my face. I think this is best used at night under a moisturizer, but I also add a few drops to my sunscreen moisturizer in the AM sometimes, especially after using Retin-A at night. I have very sensitive skin and it&#x27;s been really hard to get through the peeling and dryness caused by Retin-A, but since I started using this I am finding my skin is looking really fantastic, and the peeling the next day is a thing of the past!! I also love applying this to my face while my skin is still damp after a shower to seal in the moisture and replenish my skin&#x27;s barrier. I don&#x27;t think this product in and of itself will be the answer to keeping my skin looking young. I think honestly those expectations are best bestowed upon my Vitamin C serum, Retin-A, and obsessive sunscreen use. But this really keeps my skin hydrated and allows my sensitive skin to better tolerate the other treatment products I am using. All in all, I plan to buy this  again and again, though I won&#x27;t need to for a long time unless I knock the bottle over, because a little really goes a long way!!</li>
