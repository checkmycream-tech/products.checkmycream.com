      <li>Majority are creams so that is why Badger charges more for cream than their lotion.</li>
      <li>I gave it a shot and an so glad.</li>
      <li>Top notch suncreens ...</li>

      <li>It feels good to know that im using something natural  and safe on my children and that it comes highly  recommended by ewg.</li>
      <li>This is true.</li>
      <li>At other times  it worked great.</li>
      <li>feel on your hand dries up fairly  quickly.</li>
      <li>Fresh smell too.</li>
      <li>I came across the environmental working group site and there found a list of safe natural sunscreens that they recommend.</li>

      <li>Love the sunscreen, no issues thus far.</li>
      <li>I love that all the ingredients are safe, especially for my 6mo old.</li>
      <li>After paying a lot for a long time for another brand (Honest Co), I decided it was time to thoroughly research my child&#x27;s sunblock.</li>
      <li>i tried the cream one first and it smells funny.</li>
      <li>I highly  reccomend it!!</li>
      <li>I found the baby wipe to work better than actually washing your hands with soap and water.</li>
      <li>It might be better for big kids, I think rubbing the cream on my 17 month olds face is easier than using the stick.</li>
      <li>/&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
      <li>We like the brand so much we also purchased the insect stick.</li>
      <li>Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
      <li>Gentle for baby but remember to reapply every time lo goes into water because it washes off</li>
      <li>I myself don&#x27;t really care if I have changed the color of my skin by not working it in.  </li>
      <li>plus it really works to protect your skin.</li>
      <li>so i dont  pay for shipping and arrives  fast.  </li>
      <li>It means, Badger charges more for the same ounce if it offers longer protection.products.</li>
      <li>It means, Badger charges more for the same ounce if it offers longer protection.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen is a little thick, but it have my baby the best protection from the sun.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Would recomment any product from this high intregrity company.</li>
      <li>I try to make a few passes to make sure that it&#x27;s actually providing adequate sun protection.</li>
      <li>Works  great without unnecessary chemicals!</li>
      <li>We only reapplied once after the first application each day.</li>
      <li>ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I knew it was going to require a little more rubbing in than traditional sun screens but</li>
      <li>Used it on my 6 month old baby in Florida</li>
      <li>Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts.</li>
      <li>and you really have to work it around to not have white blotches.  </li>
      <li>Although my kids prefer a spray on I prefer that this is a natural sunblock</li>
      <li>The face stick is pretty dry and doesn&#x27;t apply well to skin</li>
      <li>We used a whole tube on our week long trip in disney.</li>
      <li>Did alot of research to find the least toxic sunblock on the market I could find and this fit the bill.</li>
      <li>This is the only sunscreen we&#x27;ve used for my now-three year old son.</li>
      <li>It also smells very strongly of Shea butter, and is quite difficult to wash off.</li>
      <li>Badger just like any other sunscreen producer sells their products for what they think they can get for each ounce of sunscreen based on their formula and ingredients that they put in that particular sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s way too dry to actually use as a sunscreen stick.  </li>

<li> ACTIVE sunscreen offers 40 minutes and SPORTS offers 80 minutes and this is a DAILY lotion which is few minutes less protection.</li>

<li> clothes.i thought my hands would be greasy all day long, but</li>
<li> Maybe mine was old &amp; dried out or something.  </li>
<li> My only concern is it&#x27;s too easy to put on too little when using the face stick, as it leaves only a very thin layer of sunscreen on the skin.</li>
<li> Badger just like any other producer uses the same labelling that they have for all their products.</li>
<li> It goes on a little thick but it is worth it considering that this is a safer sunscreen.</li>
<li> I wish the tube was a little  larger.</li>
<li> but if you look at the number of the circles on the face of the product, there is only three circles and the WATER RESISTANCE circle is missing, so it is a lotion not a cream.</li>
<li> I like the sunscreen but NOT the face stick-way to think to actually spread on anyones face-a waste of money for the face stick.</li>

<li> But even with soap and water after you toweldry your hands, greasy feel  goes away quicker than i expected.</li>
<li> Will definetly be purchasing more, even though a little expensive for small tube.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way</li>
<li> Overall, not better than the homemade version (non-nano zinc oxide, coconut and olive oils, Shea butter, beeswax, lavender oil).</li>
<li> In Badger&#x27;s case, I have learned if it has four circles, it means that it is a cream since usually the fourth circle is the WATER RESISTANCE circle.</li>
<li> Not worth it in my opinion&lt;</li>
<li> it&#x27;s thick and can leave your face white if you dont spread well.</li>
<li> After learning about all the toxins found in the typical drug store sunscreens , i threw out all my banana boat sunscreens and went on a search for safer sunscreens for my family.</li>

    <li> Top notch suncreens ... the very best on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Would recomment any product from this high intregrity company.</li>
    <li> I like the sunscreen but NOT the face stick-way to think to actually spread on anyones face-a waste of money for the face stick.</li>
    <li> The sunscreen in the tube is typical sunscreen.  A little thick and you really have to work it around to not have white blotches.  I myself don&#x27;t really care if I have changed the color of my skin by not working it in.  As long as I&#x27;m not getting burnt, I&#x27;m happy.  It&#x27;s one of the better sunscreens out there if you&#x27;re looking for something that doesn&#x27;t have cancer causing ingredients or weird things in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stick needs some work though.  It&#x27;s way too dry to actually use as a sunscreen stick.  Maybe mine was old &amp; dried out or something.  I ended up rubbing it on my hand and then putting it on my face &amp; arms instead.</li>
    <li> Works  great without unnecessary chemicals! I use this sunscreen for both my baby and my toddler</li>
    <li> Although my kids prefer a spray on I prefer that this is a natural sunblock and it worked really good.</li>
    <li> Very very happy with this product, prevents sunburn and is truly toxic chemical free!</li>
    <li> Love the sunscreen, no issues thus far. The stock is quite hard and doesn&#x27;t smear very well onto chubby baby cheeks. It might be better for big kids, I think rubbing the cream on my 17 month olds face is easier than using the stick.</li>
    <li> The face stick is pretty dry and doesn&#x27;t apply well to skin and it also hard to run in. Not worth it in my opinion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sun block is great though. Used it on my 6 month old baby in Florida and she didn&#x27;t burn at all!</li>
    <li> Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.

If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin&#x27;s DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Badger is the best selling sunscreen in most heath food stores. Now that does not make it the best since you need to read the ingredients and experience the product to know if it is the best for you and for your budget. Majority are creams so that is why Badger charges more for cream than their lotion. Creams are more difficult to apply than lotion. Badger just like any other sunscreen producer sells their products for what they think they can get for each ounce of sunscreen based on their formula and ingredients that they put in that particular sunscreen. In Badger&#x27;s case, I have learned if it has four circles, it means that it is a cream since usually the fourth circle is the WATER RESISTANCE circle. That means thicker formula.

    <li> After learning about all the toxins found in the typical drug store sunscreens , i threw out all my banana boat sunscreens and went on a search for safer sunscreens for my family. I came across the environmental working group site and there found a list of safe natural sunscreens that they recommend. Badger was on this list. I gave it a shot and an so glad. It feels good to know that im using something natural  and safe on my children and that it comes highly  recommended by ewg. I was a little conserned when i read all reviews about how greasy it is And that  it stains clothes.i thought my hands would be greasy all day long, but thats not the case...use a baby wipe and greasy feel on your hand dries up fairly  quickly. I found the baby wipe to work better than actually washing your hands with soap and water.But even with soap and water after you toweldry your hands, greasy feel  goes away quicker than i expected. Another drawback is that you have to reapply more often. With banana boats  i would apply once on my kids and they were good  for pretty much  most of day. On one occassion with badger my kids were outdoors in pool all day and they  got a little sunburn  but that because i didnt reapply. At other times  it worked great. I highly  reccomend it!! I wish the tube was a little  larger. We used a whole tube on our week long trip in disney. Will definetly be purchasing more, even though a little expensive for small tube. It helps that this is a prime item and Im a prime member so i dont  pay for shipping and arrives  fast.  I see alot of negative reviews on the face stick because it doesnt spread  well. This is true. It is difficult to spread thus leaving your face with white residue.It leaves more of a residue than the body cream. I also found the stick sunscreen much harder to wash off in shower than the body cream was.however i still like the stick better and easier than having to apply a cream on my kids faces, and my kids too prefered the stick better thana face cream. All in all, a great safe product and i love that its reccomended by ewg!!</li>
    <li> Great price, great sunscreen!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sunscreen for my kids. Yes, it will turn their skin a shade paler, but that way I know it&#x27;s rubbed in everywhere. I love that all the ingredients are safe, especially for my 6mo old. It is hard to rub in, but not that bad. I never have any problems with it.</li>
    <li> I knew it was going to require a little more rubbing in than traditional sun screens but not that much more... I like it and will buy again</li>
    <li> Gentle for baby but remember to reapply every time lo goes into water because it washes off</li>
    <li> Has to be applied very often in order to provide good coverage. My daughter was swimming and we applied it every 45 min and she still got a burn it works but only if you keep up the coverage</li>
    <li> I love this stuff... It is hard to rub in and leaves a white residues, but at least I can see they are covered!  Awesome ratings on EWG.</li>
    <li> i tried the cream one first and it smells funny. it&#x27;s thick and can leave your face white if you dont spread well. will try stick later, but i am not a fan of the cream.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is a little thick, but it have my baby the best protection from the sun. We had put it all over my son, and been outside in the pool and sun all day. We only reapplied once after the first application each day. Needless to say this sunscreen does the job.</li>
    <li> Easy on, very useful for babies</li>
    <li> Awesome face stick. Love this. Doesn&#x27;t run in eyes. Great skin protection. Doesn&#x27;t irritate skin. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen we&#x27;ve used for my now-three year old son. We usually use only the liquid sunscreen in the tube, which my soon calls &amp;#34;goop.&amp;#34; But recently we&#x27;ve been relying on the face stick, because it&#x27;s so much easier to put on. My only concern is it&#x27;s too easy to put on too little when using the face stick, as it leaves only a very thin layer of sunscreen on the skin. I try to make a few passes to make sure that it&#x27;s actually providing adequate sun protection.</li>
    <li> This stuff does work as sunblock; purchased for a Mediterranean trip for ginger people who have not been fried while using it.&lt;br /&gt;  However, the face stick is VERY thick and does not rub in, leaving clown-paint look. It also smells very strongly of Shea butter, and is quite difficult to wash off. This strips the benefits of the oils in the formula!  The cream is a bit better for visibility, but both formulae can feel grainy. Overall, not better than the homemade version (non-nano zinc oxide, coconut and olive oils, Shea butter, beeswax, lavender oil).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different non toxic sunscreens and this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve tried. A little goes a long way so it&#x27;s very good value for your $ plus it really works to protect your skin. We all use it both adults and kids and never get burned. It&#x27;s thick so takes a while to rub in but doesn&#x27;t leave you with the snowman effect once you&#x27;ve applied it.. Fresh smell too.</li>
    <li> After paying a lot for a long time for another brand (Honest Co), I decided it was time to thoroughly research my child&#x27;s sunblock. I conducted extensive research and tried several options. I agree with a variety of expert critics who suggest this is s top quality, natural brand and one you can trust. We switched 2 months ago and are very happy with the Badger brand. The separate face stick is a bonus. We like the brand so much we also purchased the insect stick.</li>
    <li> Only thing my son&#x27;s skin can tolerate.</li>
    <li> Did alot of research to find the least toxic sunblock on the market I could find and this fit the bill. Love the ingredient list, all good, feel just fine about putting this on my kids (and myself!).</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical to use this sunscreen. I worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work and that my son would get burnt. My family also has a history of skin cancer so that added to the worry. We used it for a day in Disney World and reapplied about every hour. I am happy to say that the sunscreen worked! It also has a very pleasant smell. It goes on a little thick but it is worth it considering that this is a safer sunscreen.</li>
