### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best thing about this razor&lt;BR</li>
      <li>This is especially good when doing the neck area.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s great for travel and not having to bring along the recharger on every trip</li>
      <li>make and finish is amazing, no signs of wear and tear, the plastic or material used is perfect for hair or water&lt;</li>
      <li>After using this attractive product for three weeks, I am returning it for refund to Norelco.  </li>
      <li>The Norelco reliability is unbeatable as well - 20 years of service is just amazing!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pleasant to use.</li>
      <li>I charged and used the shaver this morning and was pleasantly suprised with its performance.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had consistently good results with Norelco razors &lt;BR&gt;over the years.  </li>
      <li>and I still can&#x27;t get a really good, satisfactory shave.</li>
      <li>unit is waterproof and for good reason as you can wash the heads under running water .</li>
      <li>Probably a fair buy at $60 or so.</li>
      <li>shave is good but not as close as a blade.</li>
      <li>good battery life&lt;br /&gt;- durable</li>
      <li>Very pleased with the versatility.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an amazing device.</li>
      <li>If you are already a Norelco rotary shaver user, then you will find this model to be a nice upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;Bobzt&lt;BR&gt;Engineer</li>
      <li>The heads are floating within their retaining assembly and they conform to the curves on the face nicely.</li>
      <li>impressed with this brand that I&#x27;m looking into their new 3d models.</li>
      <li>The charge % indicator and the quick charge is great</li>
      <li>Cleaning very easy.  </li>
      <li>Since a clean razor shaves much better, this is a great &lt;BR</li>
      <li>Still , it&#x27;s nice to be able to shave without waking the household.</li>
      <li>decided to buy a more deluxe shaver this time, and bought the model 7865XL shown here.</li>
      <li>I bought this razor to replace an older model Norelco, which was also very good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Recommendation: This is a very good, easy to use, quick and quiet electric shaver - the best I have ever used.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It shaves well, not as good as a blade, but quite adequate</li>
      <li>* Don&#x27;t buy this product unless you are positive that you will be happy with it.</li>
      <li>What more can I say?  </li>
      <li>Nice and light, though.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
      <li>It works even better if you use soap with cream in it during the wash (acts a lubricant), but just washing with water and a wash rag works well too.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The shave was excellent and my skin was left soft.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My favorite feature is the ability to rinse it under the faucet.</li>
      <li>and I did not like it better than shaving with twin blade razor.</li>
      <li>Charging system better than the Braun which I just replaced.  </li>
      <li>and they get incrementally better each time.</li>
      <li>more like 8 hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The only good thing I can say about this shaver is that it is easy to clean under warm water, but what good is this if you are not getting a close shave and developing rashes on your neck!</li>
      <li>Overall a very good product.</li>
      <li>This one is more efficient (faster, better shave) than my older one, and an amazingly amount quieter.</li>
      <li>The battery strength indicator, consisting of bright LEDs showing the percentage of charge remaining in 20% increments, is very useful, and the flip-up hinged shaver head section is easy to clean with warm water (I still have to consciously force myself to do this!)</li>
      <li>The built-in power indicator makes it easy for him to figure out when to recharge it.  </li>
      <li>you can take it for travelling easily</li>
      <li>The new 7865 XL is almost as good (and hopefully as reliable).  </li>
      <li>and I think this would be a fine shaver for those with fine to medium beards.</li>
      <li>You can carry the razor, cord, and cleaning brush easily, but I have no idea if this is the way that they are supposed to fit in.</li>
      <li>Nothing will shave as close as the Mach III; the Norelco gets close to it, but does it more quickly.</li>
      <li>BLESSED WITH A LIGHT BEARD, THE UNIT DOES ME JUST FINE.  </li>
      <li>, the pivoting blade heads fit the face and as a result shave quite well.</li>
      <li>It packs easily for travel, and though it is a bit finnicky to clean, I like it because it does the job I need it to do.</li>
      <li>This does not make it traveller friendly.</li>
      <li>&gt;is that you can clean it by holdig</li>
      <li>In fact, the sideburn trimmer on the old Rotatract did a better job because of that shaver&#x27;s better shape.  </li>
      <li>also like the fact that you can rinse the head under running water to clean it.</li>
      <li>it is a bit finnicky to clean, I like it because it does the job I need it to do.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t see the advantage to spending more money for that.  </li>
      <li>It feels so good to go back to twin blade razor again.</li>
      <li>The 60day full guarantee is a lie.</li>
      <li>They have also &amp;quot;shrunk&amp;quot; the half-egg shaped power transformer, and you can use 100 - 220 volts to plug / charge, a good thing for someone who travels globally as I do.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>This is very effective and quick cleaning compared to the traditional brush method and is a real time saver.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s still a joy to use, but it takes longer (more passes in different directions to get every whisker) and won&#x27;t last all day (</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still available in certain sites even in 2011.</li>
      <li>item is worth buying, it&#x27;s fun to use...</li>
      <li>It sticks out so far that the shaver doesn&#x27;t touch your face so you can&#x27;t use your face for a pivot point - to steady the trimmer (kind of like trying to write with your hand in the air).  </li>
      <li>The 8 series looked cool, but comparing the one that was the same price, this one had more features.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true what other reviewers have said: you&#x27;ll get the best results out of the 7865XL (and the others in the 7800 series) if you wash and dry your face first.  </li>
      <li>I just purchased the new Remington Titanium self cleaning model as I feel it will work much better, judged by the performance of my older Remington.  </li>
      <li>(Come to think of it, I&#x27;ll be dead before 35 years pass.)&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product, but I don&#x27;t think it would be worth over $100.</li>
      <li>This surprised me at first because it doesn&#x27;t sound powerful</li>
      <li>The first use always take time, but as you progress shaving over and over on your face it get faster.  </li>
      <li>I am trying to use electric shaver for the first time</li>
      <li>The old Norelco had a slim cord with no stupid adaptor on it.  </li>
      <li>I went with this one--quick charge time (only an hour), the super quick charge in a hurry (enough to jump into a shower while charging, and then quick shave), the charge % indicator, and able to wash the heads under water.  </li>
      <li>I probably have to make sure I cross each area about three times in different directions (mostly going against the grain of the whiskers) to get everything.  </li>
      <li>&gt;Reasons for not getting a higher up model--</li>
      <li>If I don&#x27;t wash first</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m bumping up to the next higher model with better battery status indication ...</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m forming a positive impression.</li>
      <li>I read all the positive reviews on this shaver, so I picked one up 6 weeks ago.</li>
      <li>Outstanding performance and lasts a long time on one recharge.  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;ve owned a Norelco in the past and have had good experience with it</li>
      <li>/&gt;- easy to take apart for extensive cleaning</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to clean even when hair gets inside the cracks, just need to tap it a few times</li>
      <li>So you don&#x27;t get any warning really that it&#x27;s about to run out --</li>
      <li>this is where the tactile power switch feedback is important:  if the battery&#x27;s totally drained, but I&#x27;m not done yet, I&#x27;ll leave it off for a minute and then turn it on for 5-10 seconds of shaving before it dies again.  </li>
      <li>If I follow those two basic guidelines, my chin is smooth as can be and the shave lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>the power \\&quot;position\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t matter, it&#x27;s really off.  </li>
      <li>What do you know- this time, &amp;quot;new and improved&amp;quot; really is accurate!&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is very reluctant to cut the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>found the 7865 XL to be a very well built product</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very ineffective.</li>
      <li>and if we go out in the evening--he grows his hair fast, so</li>
      <li>I can get a close shave with it, but I have to go over the same spot 5 to 6 times to get it smooth even after the so called &amp;quot;two week&amp;quot; waiting period.  </li>
      <li>FAST RECHARGE.</li>
      <li>very close&lt;</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s a good thing for me personally because the closeness of wet shaves makes my face break out.  </li>
      <li>First of , this model is almost identical to the 6000 series Quadras except for a slight change in colours and trim.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s most effective feature is the pivoting head as this allows the heads to stay in contact with the skin even when shaving the curved and uneven areas of the face.</li>
      <li>My wife convinced me to shell but the extra for a new one - better technology, new blades, etc.  </li>
      <li>My old Norelco&#x27;s side trimmers always cut right</li>
      <li>This one gives him the closest shave and is just right for his sensitive skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this razor to replace an older model Norelco, which was also very good. My favorite feature is the ability to rinse it under the faucet. The razor delivers a shave that is comparable to a blade, in half the time. The pivoting heads and &amp;quot;Quadra Action&amp;quot; enable the razor to get into the tough spots, while still maintaining contact with the skin. I use the razor  three times a week, and the charge lasts about 4-5 weeks, and recharges in 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;There are two things that I take issue with however. The first is that the carrying case is odd. You can carry the razor, cord, and cleaning brush easily, but I have no idea if this is the way that they are supposed to fit in. The instructions offer no clue.&lt;br /&gt;The second thing is the pop-up trimmer on the back. It is absolutly useless. Maybe it works better for longer hair, but certainly not for short hair near the sideburns.</li>
    <li> I owned an older model Remington three head shaver for about 2 years before I bought this one.  It always gave me a close shave without having to make multiple passes or contort my face.&lt;br /&gt;But I dropped it a few times and cracked the plastic head for it which I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement for.  So I upgraded and paid over $100 for what I thought was a quality electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed with this shaver.  I can get a close shave with it, but I have to go over the same spot 5 to 6 times to get it smooth even after the so called &amp;quot;two week&amp;quot; waiting period.  I just purchased the new Remington Titanium self cleaning model as I feel it will work much better, judged by the performance of my older Remington.  I gave it two stars only because the flip up shaver works well.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve owned a Norelco in the past and have had good experience with it stay with Norelco, otherwise, I&#x27;d recommend Remington any day.</li>
    <li> My husband is disabled, therefore must use an electric one.  This one gives him the closest shave and is just right for his sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My mom gave me this as a gift from about 10 years ago. It&#x27;s an amazing device. I originally complained to my mom when I started growing facial hair and before I could start buying disposable razors - she gave me this. Thanks mom - I&#x27;ve never had to spend a dime for facial shaving products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs&lt;br /&gt;- good battery life&lt;br /&gt;- durable, I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times and actually broke the swivel notch for the trimmer but used crazy glue to repair it - I dropped it again so the notch is loose but seems to be swiveling open/close fine&lt;br /&gt;- make and finish is amazing, no signs of wear and tear, the plastic or material used is perfect for hair or water&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s easy to clean even when hair gets inside the cracks, just need to tap it a few times and it comes out - unless you want to open the device with some torx screw driver&lt;br /&gt;- easy to take apart for extensive cleaning&lt;br /&gt;- you can take it for travelling easily&lt;br /&gt;- you can shave while it&#x27;s charging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs&lt;br /&gt;- even after over 10 years, nothing comes to mind&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So impressed with this brand that I&#x27;m looking into their new 3d models. I would recommend this shaver even now competing with the newer models. I think I&#x27;m going to rebuild mine and keep it as a back up. It&#x27;s still available in certain sites even in 2011.</li>
    <li> After 30+ years of blade shaving I decided to go electric. I really, really wanted this to work out, but alas I&#x27;m back to the blade.&lt;br /&gt;I found the 7865 XL to be a very well built product and I think this would be a fine shaver for those with fine to medium beards. I think my beard is just too tough for an electric razor. I tried shaving with Lectric Shave and without, but by 3 o&#x27;clock every day I looked like I needed a shave.&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead and give it a shot. With the 60 day money-back guarantee you&#x27;ve got nothing to lose.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace my Mach III blade. I have used it for over a month, past the amount of time it takes your skin and face to get used to it. Nothing will shave as close as the Mach III; the Norelco gets close to it, but does it more quickly. I have never owned an electric razor before this one, so I have nothing to compare it to. However, here is my opinion:&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;BR&gt;*Shaves very close&lt;BR&gt;*Easy to clean&lt;BR&gt;*Runs for a long time between charges&lt;BR&gt;*Charges quickly&lt;BR&gt;*Conforms to your face well&lt;BR&gt;*Useful voltage converter&lt;BR&gt;*Nice carrying case&lt;BR&gt;*Contrary to a previous reviewer, it does have one flat edge where it won&#x27;t roll of the table&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;BR&gt;*Trimmer doesn&#x27;t trim as well as I&#x27;d like it to&lt;BR&gt;*Takes a few weeks for your skin to get used to it and get a close shave</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the versatility.  Can use either with cord or without.  Cleaning very easy.  Charging system better than the Braun which I just replaced.  These comments apply to shaver which my husband uses, not me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true what other reviewers have said: you&#x27;ll get the best results out of the 7865XL (and the others in the 7800 series) if you wash and dry your face first.  Then it glides smoothly and works in very few passes.  I probably have to make sure I cross each area about three times in different directions (mostly going against the grain of the whiskers) to get everything.  If I follow those two basic guidelines, my chin is smooth as can be and the shave lasts all day.  If I don&#x27;t wash first it&#x27;s still a joy to use, but it takes longer (more passes in different directions to get every whisker) and won&#x27;t last all day (more like 8 hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item is worth buying, it&#x27;s fun to use... I&#x27;d give it 4 and a half stars.  To get 5 it would need to do everything in a single pass, and that&#x27;s a tall order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that you can rinse the head under running water to clean it.</li>
    <li> I am trying to use electric shaver for the first time and I did not like it better than shaving with twin blade razor. I tried few times to shave and it sucks. It feels so good to go back to twin blade razor again. I think I will never try electric shaver again. It is much more painful than using a twin blade razor.</li>
    <li> BLESSED WITH A LIGHT BEARD, THE UNIT DOES ME JUST FINE.  CLEANING THE UNIT IS A LITTLE CUMBERSOME.  FAST RECHARGE.</li>
    <li> To achive the maximum closeness, you must follow the instruction from the small hand book included in the package.  At first, you will not see a dramatic change but keep using it and your facial hair will grow to be shaved by 7865XL faster and comfortable every time.  My facial hair is thick and a common razor&#x27;s blade last about 3 to 4 weeks average use.  The 7865XL does it in no time and close to my face.  My face ends uplike a baby&#x27;s bottom.  The first use always take time, but as you progress shaving over and over on your face it get faster.  Depends on your skin and your hair growth too.  I can shave in less than 5 min and I have side burns that the combs can go around the edges; of course with some help from my hand.  As I hold the hair upward, the electric razor does it job.  What more can I say?  You gotta try it to prove yourself wrong.  And remember, follow the instructions from the small booklet.</li>
    <li> Outstanding performance and lasts a long time on one recharge.  HOWEVER , you can get this one at Cotsco for 80 bucks.</li>
    <li> Warning*** Don&#x27;t buy this product unless you are positive that you will be happy with it. The 60day full guarantee is a lie. Amazon gave me a very hard time returning this when my son was unhappy with the shave,and I was within the 60 days,  and when they did agree, after numerous attempts through email, they deducted 20% and are only refunding me $84 out of the $109. I understand not getting back the shipping, but when they say satisfaction guaranteed, I expect the full purchase price back. This was a truly awful experience with Amazon.</li>
    <li> The 7825XL, 7845XL, 7865XL and 7885XL models are all basically the same razor, differing only in the way they display battery/charging  status (anywhere from 1 LED to a complete tiny LCD display).  The shaving peformance is fine for me -- not as close as a wet shave but that&#x27;s a good thing for me personally because the closeness of wet shaves makes my face break out.  Every 3-7 years I buy a new Norelco and they get incrementally better each time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m writing to warn about one feature.  Every shaver I&#x27;d had up to this one had a physical slider switch to turn it on and off.  This models has a push button.  This means you can&#x27;t tell BY TOUCH whether it&#x27;s on or off.  This is critical for me because I usually shave in the car (sitting in traffic) with the stereo blaring and I can&#x27;t hear the shaver (especially since the newer models are pretty quiet).  I turn it on and off a lot as traffic conditions change. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Further, when the battery is low, my previous shavers would just run slower and slower until they came to a gradual stop.  This one slows slightly (imperceptably to me, really) and then just \\&quot;falls off the cliff\\&quot; and stops cold.  So you don&#x27;t get any warning really that it&#x27;s about to run out -- if I knew it was running down, then I&#x27;d shave a lot faster! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And this is where the tactile power switch feedback is important:  if the battery&#x27;s totally drained, but I&#x27;m not done yet, I&#x27;ll leave it off for a minute and then turn it on for 5-10 seconds of shaving before it dies again.  With the push-button power control this is really confusing because you&#x27;re never really sure what&#x27;s on and off.  It turns out the the power button is like a pulse that gets sent to an internal microcontroller (I&#x27;m guessing), so after it&#x27;s been off for a while the power \\&quot;position\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t matter, it&#x27;s really off.  You just push to reboot the thing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, my 7825XL was robbed out of my car last night and I&#x27;m buying another one of these, so I guess that&#x27;s an endorsement.  But I&#x27;m bumping up to the next higher model with better battery status indication ...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Norelco&#x27;s for over 20 years now and this is the worst! &lt;br /&gt;The side trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut anything, the charge only lasts one week and the shaver causes a rash on my neck.  My old Norelco&#x27;s side trimmers always cut right so I think they ought to fire the engineer that designed this one.  All the previous Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve owned had a charge that lasted two weeks so I think they are skimping out on the batteries they use.  The design of the head is lousy; the stupid holes actually cause a rash on my neck. &lt;br /&gt;I know they say to apply less pressure but if you do then you don&#x27;t get a close shave on the rest of your face.  The other thing I hate is the external adaptor on the cord.  The old Norelco had a slim cord with no stupid adaptor on it.  The only good thing I can say about this shaver is that it is easy to clean under warm water, but what good is this if you are not getting a close shave and developing rashes on your neck!</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my boyfriend who was tired of shaving all the time.  I gave this to him a while ago and it is still kicking and he&#x27;s still using it.  The built-in power indicator makes it easy for him to figure out when to recharge it.  It&#x27;s portable so it&#x27;s great for travel and not having to bring along the recharger on every trip \\&quot;just in case\\&quot; is a definite added bonus.  Of course, it&#x27;s never going to shave as close as a traditional razor but you can&#x27;t beat it for convenience.</li>
    <li> Just brought the 7865 XL Quadra Action shaver to replace my 20 year old Norelco Rotatract HP1318 that died.  I was going to replace the batteries again (I replaced them once before about 10 years ago) but the price for doing that has gone up to [$$]. My wife convinced me to shell but the extra for a new one - better technology, new blades, etc.  After some research, I decided to go for the 7865 XL because of the new \\&quot;Quadra Action\\&quot; blades that are suppose to give one a closer shave.  &lt;br /&gt;Well, after a few days, the fancy new 7865 is no better than my old Rotatract in closeness.  In fact, the sideburn trimmer on the old Rotatract did a better job because of that shaver&#x27;s better shape.  The 7865 XL&#x27;s sideburn trimmer sticks out about twice as far so it is harder to cut a straight trim.  It sticks out so far that the shaver doesn&#x27;t touch your face so you can&#x27;t use your face for a pivot point - to steady the trimmer (kind of like trying to write with your hand in the air).  I hope it gets easier as I get use to the shaver.  Mechanically, both trimmers look similar.&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Quadra Action\\&quot; shaving head is no better than the old Rotatract heads.  The new \\&quot;holes\\&quot; for \\&quot;short hair\\&quot; do nothing.  Unfortunately, because they cover almost 1/2 of each circular blade, it takes longer to get the (shaving) job done.  The \\&quot;Reflex Action\\&quot; feature also does nothing extra.&lt;br /&gt;If I had the opportunity to test the shaver before buying, I would have just purchased the bottom of the line Norelco 4601X at half the price or less.  The 4601X appears to have the same basic features as my old Rotatract.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not knocking Norelcos, just their fancy, high end units.  I&#x27;ve used Remingtons and other non-three circulating blade shavers and they just don&#x27;t compare to the Norelco system for closeness.  The Norelco reliability is unbeatable as well - 20 years of service is just amazing!  I give my old Rotatract 5 stars for reliability and performance.  The new 7865 XL is almost as good (and hopefully as reliable).  I just hate paying extra for all the useless new features.</li>
    <li> No electric razor will shave as close as a blade, but&lt;BR&gt;some of us can&#x27;t use a blade because of problems with&lt;BR&gt;skin irritation. Electrics are also easier to use.  &lt;BR&gt;I&#x27;ve had consistently good results with Norelco razors &lt;BR&gt;over the years.  For me, they shave closer than foil &lt;BR&gt;razors.  My only complaint is that when the battery &lt;BR&gt;goes (after 4 or 5 years), it has to be replaced by a &lt;BR&gt;technician and the cost is high.  In fact, the cost of a&lt;BR&gt;new battery and new heads so high that you might just&lt;br /&gt;as well buy a new razor.  The best thing about this razor&lt;BR&gt;is that you can clean it by holdig it under running water.  &lt;BR&gt;Since a clean razor shaves much better, this is a great &lt;BR&gt;feature.</li>
    <li> I got this razor for my husband for his birthday.  He had a Norelco 4845 (I think) for the last 5 years so I know that the products were long lasting.  I was looking to buy new blades but they were hard to find so I figured I&#x27;d just buy a new razor.  &lt;BR&gt;Reasons I went with this one--quick charge time (only an hour), the super quick charge in a hurry (enough to jump into a shower while charging, and then quick shave), the charge % indicator, and able to wash the heads under water.  All of these were an upgrade from my husband&#x27;s old razor.  In the last 4 months, he has only needed to charge it twice (and he shaves about twice a day, before work and if we go out in the evening--he grows his hair fast, so please don&#x27;t think it is because the razor isn&#x27;t doing it&#x27;s job...he&#x27;s just like that).  He can rinse the heads under water, eliminating the hair around the trashcan when he misses.  The charge % indicator and the quick charge is great so he doesn&#x27;t waken up in the morning and realize he can&#x27;t shave because it isn&#x27;t charged.  I also think the razor is cutting the hair better (and I know a wife can tell) than his old one.  &lt;BR&gt;Reasons for not getting a higher up model--Well, the price was one issue.  I spent around $99 at Target for this model.  The next highest in the series has an LCD charge % indicator, and I didn&#x27;t feel it was necessary (and just one more electronic component to deal with).  The 8 series looked cool, but comparing the one that was the same price, this one had more features.  And it looked like the only difference with the heads was that the spacer for short and longer hairs were alternating rather than two separate areas.  I really didn&#x27;t see the advantage to spending more money for that.  So I chose this one.</li>
    <li> This Norelco (actually made by Philips) one was bought to replace an older shaver (I&#x27;ve used Norelco, Philips and Panasonics over the years.) This one is more efficient (faster, better shave) than my older one, and an amazingly amount quieter. What do you know- this time, &amp;quot;new and improved&amp;quot; really is accurate!&lt;br /&gt;What I like: the shaver fits the hand well, the pivoting blade heads fit the face and as a result shave quite well. The battery strength indicator, consisting of bright LEDs showing the percentage of charge remaining in 20% increments, is very useful, and the flip-up hinged shaver head section is easy to clean with warm water (I still have to consciously force myself to do this!) They have also &amp;quot;shrunk&amp;quot; the half-egg shaped power transformer, and you can use 100 - 220 volts to plug / charge, a good thing for someone who travels globally as I do.&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like: the pop-up trimmer is only fair - it works, but it&#x27;s actually not as effective as the one on my old shaver! The deep well holding the head rotors shafts is not so easy to clean with a brush, particularly with the hinged head; they are still using a non-user replaceable NiCd battery; the gimmicky cutter head plate section with holes seems merely that - gimmicky, not useful for any real shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Tips: After cleaning the head / blade assemblies, allow them to dry fully and spray-lubricate with something like &amp;quot;Shaver Saver.&amp;quot; When power seems low, turn the shaver on and allow to discharge fully before reccharging - these are, after all, still NiCd batteries with the &amp;quot;memory&amp;quot; effect. These tips have allowed my previous electrics&#x27; battery - and cutter head assemblies - to last a long time (I have a heavy beard - even with a blade shaver, I have to shave again in the afternoon if I have a dinner appointment.)&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: This is a very good, easy to use, quick and quiet electric shaver - the best I have ever used. It packs easily for travel, and though it is a bit finnicky to clean, I like it because it does the job I need it to do. Given the several deficits, I&#x27;d never give it four stars if not for how it handles its ultimate function - shaving my beard.though it is a bit finnicky to clean, I like it because it does the job I need it to do.

    <li> I read all the positive reviews on this shaver, so I picked one up 6 weeks ago. It shaves my face quite well, but does a lousy job on my neck and jawline. I had to go to an engagement party recently, and to get a decent, clean shave I had to break down and use a razor. The booklet says to use only the electric shaver for 3 weeks straight to give your skin time to adjust; but not only wouldn&#x27;t this thing shave my neck decently, it actually caused a nasty rash to develop as well. I had to use Lanacane for a week to get rid of it. This Norelco model will be my last attempt at using an electric shaver (I tried a high-priced Braun as well, with similar results). Over 90 bucks spent on this thing, and I still can&#x27;t get a really good, satisfactory shave. I can&#x27;t recomment this product.</li>
    <li> I find the product performs well and holds a charge well into 4 days.  It does take a break-in period for your face and the razor.  You have to stick with it through an \\&quot;uncomfortable\\&quot; period.  Overall a very good product.</li>
    <li> First of , this model is almost identical to the 6000 series Quadras except for a slight change in colours and trim.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s most effective feature is the pivoting head as this allows the heads to stay in contact with the skin even when shaving the curved and uneven areas of the face. This is especially good when doing the neck area. Most electrics are notoriously bad when doing the neck compared to blades but the Quadra is about as good as an electric gets.&lt;br /&gt;The unit is waterproof and for good reason as you can wash the heads under running water . This is very effective and quick cleaning compared to the traditional brush method and is a real time saver.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is good but not as close as a blade. Even though it feels as close immediately after a shave , the truth is that with a blade I can shave every 2 days , whereas with this I have to shave every day. I think that electrics make your face swell slightly due to the vibrations of the shaver and this is the reason for the apparent closeness after shaving , but this swelling goes down in a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;The unit is extremely quiet and vibration free for an electric ( much quieter than previous Norelcos). This surprised me at first because it doesn&#x27;t sound powerful but it doesn&#x27;t have any problems tackling the toughest hairs. Still , it&#x27;s nice to be able to shave without waking the household. Also this is a sign of quality. Less noise and vibration means that better reliability.&lt;br /&gt;Couple of minor negatives,&lt;br /&gt;1. The trimmer- Unfortunately Norelco got it wrong . It&#x27;s very ineffective. It is very reluctant to cut the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;2. The heads - Supposedly , holes for shart hairs and slots for long hair. Personally I don&#x27;t believe the holes do a darn thing. What I have noticed is that the heads are made of a material that tends to stick to your face while shaving making smooth strokes difficult. For this reason you will have to use lighter pressure. This is why it takes a little practice to use .&lt;br /&gt;3. Non standard shaving cord - Also has a big transformer end. This does not make it traveller friendly. Also if you lose the cord you will have to order a new one from Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;4. Shape - The shaver has no flat edges . What this means is that it will roll with the slightest disturbance when you put it down after use. One time it rolled off my dresser and landed on the floor. The slight disturbance was just simply opening a dresser draw. Luckily the shaver is solidly built and made to last. Just be careful.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaver to anyone who has had trouble with electrics in the past. Try it out..</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco rotary shavers for the last 20 years. The last model I purchased worked for 8 years before the batteries wore out. It was a economy unit, model number 815RX.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy a more deluxe shaver this time, and bought the model 7865XL shown here. It was more expensive than the old one. I charged and used the shaver this morning and was pleasantly suprised with its performance. The heads are floating within their retaining assembly and they conform to the curves on the face nicely. The shave was excellent and my skin was left soft.&lt;br /&gt;To those who don&#x27;t regularly use an electric shaver - some advice. In order for it to work properly, you MUST wash and then dry your face. If I don&#x27;t do this, I have found that my skin will become irritated and red. It works even better if you use soap with cream in it during the wash (acts a lubricant), but just washing with water and a wash rag works well too.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a quality unit. If you are already a Norelco rotary shaver user, then you will find this model to be a nice upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;Bobzt&lt;BR&gt;Engineer</li>
    <li> Bought this to &amp;quot;replace&amp;quot; a 35 year old corded Norelco Triple-Header that still works fine, but the blades are a bit worn out.&lt;br /&gt;Bargain-shopped and finally found a new 7865XL for $40.&lt;br /&gt;First impressions were: &amp;quot;Boy, this thing is nothing like the build quality of my 35 year old Norelco. Kinda noisy, too. And the trimmer is very cheesy. Nice and light, though.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for a few weeks now and I&#x27;m forming a positive impression. The LED that keeps track of battery charge is nice, Just plug it in for a few hours (I use a timer) when she gets down to 20%. Norelco really SHOULD enter the late 20th century and provide an auto-off safe charger, though.&lt;br /&gt;It shaves well, not as good as a blade, but quite adequate and I have a tough beard. Probably not better than my old one was with fresh blades.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pleasant to use. No irritation. The water wash is great.&lt;br /&gt;The storage bag is junk, but I don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer looks cheesy and flimsy, but it does work.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it will hold up 35 years like my old one, but maybe I&#x27;m wrong. (Come to think of it, I&#x27;ll be dead before 35 years pass.)&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product, but I don&#x27;t think it would be worth over $100. Probably a fair buy at $60 or so.</li>
    <li> After using this attractive product for three weeks, I am returning it for refund to Norelco.  Problems are skin irritation and painful hair pulling.  Additionally, the shave is not close compared with even a disposable blade, despite using pre-shave conditioners.  I was very disappointed in the quality of shave, because this product is well-made and there were many postive reviews.</li>
