### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Not too impressed.</li>
      <li>The plates don&#x27;t quite align, though the titanium was awesome on my hair</li>
      <li>My daughter said it was just perfect</li>
      <li>Very good straightener !</li>
      <li>Best flatiron EVEEEER!!</li>
      <li>Great purchase.</li>
      <li>It was great while it lasted.</li>
      <li>I love this straightener!!</li>
      <li>Works great and price was good too.</li>
      <li>and I love the color too!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>It heats up quickly, is smooth on your hair and does a great job.  </li>
      <li>This one is AMAZING.</li>
      <li>so it flattens out my hair nicely.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I have one and love it.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure this is a knock-off.</li>
      <li>It is think, light and fits in my hands very easily</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also lite and easy to use.</li>
      <li>This is a great flat iron.  </li>
      <li>Great flat iron!</li>
      <li>Works great just as I expected</li>
      <li>It glides smoothly and gets very hot very fast.</li>
      <li>Get really hot in just under a minute!</li>
      <li>and it actually did a really nice job straightening and curling my shoulder length &amp;#34;lob&amp;#34; haircut.</li>
      <li>This allows the hair to flow through the plates nicely as everyone&#x27;s hair thickness is different.</li>
      <li>I love it, it&#x27;s a way better than CHI or other prand</li>
      <li>Love it, barely use it tho.</li>
      <li>But it is most definitely not a quality product.</li>
      <li>Exactly what was listed.</li>
      <li>I love this flat iron!</li>
      <li>One week and the paint was chipping, after the most gentle of daily use.</li>
      <li>I have not purchased a flat iron in 7 years, simply because I loved mine.</li>
      <li>I love my new flat iron!</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t even get my hair straight ; DONT BUY THIS</li>
      <li>Might give the original one of these (the baby blue one) a try, if the Sam Villa one I bought elsewhere doesn&#x27;t work out.</li>
      <li>This flat iron gets very hot</li>
      <li>Really wish I didn&#x27;t have to send it back.</li>
      <li>I have thicker hair that gets lots of frizzes and has a natural wave.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t heat up very quickly and the area that straightens your hair is relatively small.</li>
      <li>I got the pink one as it was cheaper then the other colors available from Amazon.</li>
      <li>I was looking all over for a pink one in this brand, and finally found it, thanks!</li>

<li> I&#x27;m a licensed hairstylist and I definitely recommend this flat iron.</li>
<li> I straightened my hair in half the time of my old straightener.</li>
<li> If the cord length is too long just wind some of it up and use a wire tie.</li>
<li> It also has a really long cord so you can move around with it and get to all parts of your hair.</li>
<li> No the plates are not flat against each other however they should not be.</li>
<li> My hair stylist got hers at her shop through a sales rep and none of the plates are flat against each other  </li>
<li> And I&#x27;ve only been using my flat iron for a few days and the pink  coating is chipping off already. ..</li>
<li> The pink on this product has already chipped off.</li>
<li> I only didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because the heat tranfers to the outside of the flat iron because it&#x27;s so thin</li>
<li> This is NOT worth it.</li>
<li> Use a little pressure when going through the hair.</li>
<li> It turns off every time you clamp down on your hair!  </li>
<li> It worked worse than my 20$ flat iron &amp; I paid $100 for this one !</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s hard for me to hold.</li>
<li> This flat iron was fake !</li>
<li> Very poor quality.</li>
<li> So disappointed.</li>
<li> In fact, I doubt it is, because they would have gone through an awful lot of packaging precision to pull that off.</li>

    <li> Very poor quality. The pink on this product has already chipped off. Would not recommend,</li>
    <li> Not too impressed. Doesn&#x27;t heat up very quickly and the area that straightens your hair is relatively small.</li>
    <li> Great purchase. Will totally recommend.</li>
    <li> Best flatiron EVEEEER!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron was fake ! It worked worse than my 20$ flat iron &amp; I paid $100 for this one ! It didn&#x27;t even get my hair straight ; DONT BUY THIS</li>

    <li> Believe what everyone has already said. This is NOT worth it. I can&#x27;t say for sure this is a knock-off. In fact, I doubt it is, because they would have gone through an awful lot of packaging precision to pull that off. But it is most definitely not a quality product. One week and the paint was chipping, after the most gentle of daily use. The plates don&#x27;t quite align, though the titanium was awesome on my hair and it actually did a really nice job straightening and curling my shoulder length &amp;#34;lob&amp;#34; haircut.

    <li> I love it, it&#x27;s a way better than CHI or other prand</li>
    <li> Bought one year ago. Just wouldn&#x27;t turn on yesterday. So disappointed. It was great while it lasted.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! Get really hot in just under a minute!</li>
    <li> This was bought for my MIL. I have one and love it.</li>
    <li> I have not purchased a flat iron in 7 years, simply because I loved mine. This one is AMAZING. I straightened my hair in half the time of my old straightener. It is think, light and fits in my hands very easily and I love the color too!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift and it is defective!  It turns off every time you clamp down on your hair!  I&#x27;m hoping for an exchange or refund</li>
    <li> I got the pink one as it was cheaper then the other colors available from Amazon. This one replaces the one I had for 8 years. I have chin length hair so the 1 inch works well for me. I also got the one inch as it would be lighter to hold then then wider ones. I like the longer cord as my outlet is a distance away from my mirror. Also a longer cord is safer then using an extension cord. If the cord length is too long just wind some of it up and use a wire tie. I have thicker hair that gets lots of frizzes and has a natural wave. This flat iron gets very hot so it flattens out my hair nicely. No the plates are not flat against each other however they should not be. My hair stylist got hers at her shop through a sales rep and none of the plates are flat against each other  Use a little pressure when going through the hair. This allows the hair to flow through the plates nicely as everyone&#x27;s hair thickness is different. It does have a 4 year warranty.</li>
    <li> Love this product. The titanium make your hair shine and does not break the ends off. It has a smith finish. It&#x27;s also lite and easy to use. It also curls hair well</li>
    <li> Exactly what was listed. Works great and price was good too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a licensed hairstylist and I definitely recommend this flat iron. It glides smoothly and gets very hot very fast. I love my new flat iron! I only didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because the heat tranfers to the outside of the flat iron because it&#x27;s so thin and it&#x27;s hard for me to hold.
