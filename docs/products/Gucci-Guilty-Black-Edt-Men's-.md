      <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can save yourself a trip to the mall and some sales speech from a highly attractive women who wants to tell you about how sexy you smell when you know she wouldn&#x27;t give you the time of day</li>
      <li>Love the smell.  </li>
      <li>I think this is quite possibly the best cologne I have ever bought</li>
      <li>everything else was ok</li>
      <li>It seems it&#x27;s more water based than oil based.</li>
      <li>Also like I said it is more of a manly pheremone type smell instead of some over powering cologne smell</li>
      <li>but then once it lingers a bit it really smells great.</li>
      <li>I guess their samples have a stronger smell more perfumey smell.</li>
      <li>It has a nice clean smell and it lasts all day and it&#x27;s not over powering.</li>
      <li>it smells strong when sprayed like more musky, but when on my skin it becomes softer and smells great!&lt;br /&gt;yeaa</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite one!!</li>
      <li>Girls really know it smells good up close.</li>
      <li>If those notes interest you then go for it, but I strongly suggest you try this one before you buy it.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery, brand new, smells great</li>
      <li>If you want one that has a very strong smell and lasts all day the Gucci intense is a better choice.</li>
      <li>My wife is the one that picks this kind of stuff out for me, because really she is the one I want to impress.</li>
      <li>The cologne smells fantastic.....</li>
      <li>It smells great as well but has a slightly different smell.</li>
      <li>My new favorite fragrance!</li>
      <li>a preface, I&#x27;ve purchased more than 20 bottles, ranging from &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; colognes to the more popular types and have spent years finding ones to put into my rotation.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth every dollar!</li>
      <li>Love the fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>Cannot really smell it from more than 2-3 feet away.</li>
      <li>Equally as good as the double priced one at Macy&#x27;s , Ulta and Sephora stores.</li>
      <li>I own quite a bit of cologne, and I&#x27;m not sure anything smells as good as this.</li>
      <li>but, it does wear off rather quickly.</li>
      <li>I recently purchased this Cologne and i am very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t go high price for this kind of stuff, but he really wanted it.  </li>
      <li>and it lasts really long(whole day ofcourse)!!</li>
      <li>As for the cologne it was worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Right up there with my Versace and dolce &amp; gabbana</li>
      <li>Nice shopping with you ill be more happy to shop with you in future and everything was on time.</li>
      <li>i need a new one ASAP when it is available</li>
      <li>If you want that really bold smell they have the intense and it wont disappoint.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Shipping time was also very fast.</li>
      <li>And of course the price was very reasonable.</li>
      <li>When I first smelled this cologne</li>
      <li>thank you most of things I ordered werre sent on a timely fashion,,I DID ORDER A BIG WHEEL WHICH GOT LOST</li>
      <li>This cologne has gotten me many compliments and I tend to just put enough on so that it is suttle and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>The Gucci Guilty Intense is much better and more strong and much more lasting .</li>
      <li>I received it pretty fast.</li>
      <li>Smells great, long lasting and is now one of my new go to scents.</li>
      <li>It smells slightly different from the mall sample and not as strong.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I had never smelled this before ordering it but my daughter wanted me to order for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day and I&#x27;m really glad I did.  The scent is wonderful, warm and soft, without being overpowered by some of the stronger men&#x27;s colognes that are out there.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I received it pretty fast. I think this is quite possibly the best cologne I have ever bought and it lasts really long(whole day ofcourse)!! Definitely worth every dollar!</li>
    <li> Very good fragrance.  It is noe of my favorites!</li>
    <li> Smells good but very weak projection and longevity.</li>
    <li> Nice shopping with you ill be more happy to shop with you in future and everything was on time. Gucci everything</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  Love the fast delivery.  Love the price</li>
    <li> Awesome.... and on time!!!</li>
    <li> The Gucci Guilty Intense is much better and more strong and much more lasting . The smoky scent in Guilty intense makes this a low rate one</li>
    <li> Smells awesome. Fast delivery.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I like it in the morning, but by noon or so its just a memory. I have to take the bottle with me if I need to freshen up for an afternoon meeting.</li>
    <li> it smells strong when sprayed like more musky, but when on my skin it becomes softer and smells great!&lt;br /&gt;yeaa</li>
    <li> ...I don&#x27;t usually review colognes since I find scents to be a very subjective thing; especially since cologne reacts differently to each person.  But, with the extensive amount of bad reviews for this product, I felt I needed to say something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a preface, I&#x27;ve purchased more than 20 bottles, ranging from &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; colognes to the more popular types and have spent years finding ones to put into my rotation. I do have a preference for sporty, &amp;#34;watery,&amp;#34; dark/seductive, and citrus-oriented colognes... I&#x27;m not too big on traditional musky colognes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviews have indicated, this cologne isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; -- put another way, it&#x27;s not abrasive.  When applied correctly, it creates a subtle scent that is both clean and masculine, with a hint of playful seductiveness.  It lasts a long time and really opens up as the day goes on.  The minty quality is at the forefront upon spraying and becomes less noticeable.  The floral notes become softer towards the end also; all of this blends well with the underlying musky/woodier notes at about the two hour mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never experienced the &amp;#34;alcohol&amp;#34; smell that other reviews mention.  This phenomenon only occurs in 3 instances in my experience: 1) it is a fake; 2) it was stored improperly; or, 3) it expired.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a christmas gift, arrived on time, this smells very masculine, and lasts a really long time. Would def reccomend it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for valentines day and this cologne smells amazing. I am so happy I purchased it.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend discovered this fragrance when we were in Vegas. I decided to get it for him for Christmas and it&#x27;s the perfect fragrance for a guy.</li>
    <li> This scent is amazing!  My husband loves it!  I love it on him as well :)  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> WOW! I just love the smell! My boyfriend smells amazing every time he wears this cologne. He wears it almost every time we go out.</li>
    <li> Cant go wrong for the price it got to me quick and its original box with wrapping!  You will love it!</li>
    <li> Personally I had been using Guilty Black for six months, and of the three bottles I&#x27;ve purchased, this one is the least satisfying. The scent is a lot weaker and the unpleasant alcohol smell is really covering up the original scent. The duration of the scent is about two to three hours, whereas my last two bottles could last up to six or even longer. I&#x27;ve seen that one of the comments agreed with me in some ways. Utterly disappointed!!! I wouldn&#x27;t go ahead and say this is a fake, but their quality definitely dropped.....</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend &amp; he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;We got a small sample in the mail &amp; decided to buy it online. This big bottle smells just like the sample!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping time was also very fast.</li>
    <li> Loved the cologne. I had gotten it for my husband as an anniversary gift and he loved it. Also, save a few bucks</li>
    <li> First of all the service was awesome. As for the cologne it was worth every penny. It has a nice clean smell and it lasts all day and it&#x27;s not over powering. When I first smelled this cologne I knew I had to have it. And of course the price was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> very nice but It does not last 1 hour</li>
    <li> I love this cologne. I received a sample and gave it to my husband.  He really liked it as well.  Great price on Amazon. Is the real deal. Bought one for our son for his birthday too.</li>
    <li> Smells great my son was very pleased with it and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Gucci!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great, long lasting and is now one of my new go to scents. Right up there with my Versace and dolce &amp; gabbana</li>
    <li> Love the smell but its a little weak and disappears quickly.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the cologne. When I tried it at the store I thought it smelled great and suited me very nicely. I also must add I really like the bottle it has a cool look and is made of thick glass and didn&#x27;t break when I accidentally dropped it the day after I bought it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this! I bought it as a birthday gift for my fiance and it smells so wonderful! Plus it is half the price as the department stores.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for his birthday.  I never wanted to pay this kind of price of for any cologne or perfume in my life. I don&#x27;t go high price for this kind of stuff, but he really wanted it.  When I got it, I just wrapped it up.  On his birthday, when he opened it, he was surprised at how much there was. He couldn&#x27;t believe I got so much for that price.  (He doesnt know the exact price, just that I wouldnt go crazy, because I dont like spending money lol). He loves it and wears it everyday</li>
    <li> This is by far the best cologne that I have ever purchased! This cologne has gotten me many compliments and I tend to just put enough on so that it is suttle and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> i just recieve this perfume and also 3 more i was so happy about it box looked great bottle also but at the time that i tried na na!!! fake perfume smells like water with alcohol! this is so frustrating and dissapointing.</li>
    <li> it was what I wanted and I got it on  time thank you most of things I ordered werre sent on a timely fashion,,I DID ORDER A BIG WHEEL WHICH GOT LOST AND NEVER GOT REDELIVERED AS PROMISED ,,I was very upset by that i was lied to about that also</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this Cologne and i am very pleased with it. I enjoy great fragrances of all kinds and this one really smells great kind of musky but then once it lingers a bit it really smells great. and lasts all day. Highly recommend for anyone who loves cologne like me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite one!! I love it as well as my girlfriend!!</li>
    <li> Equally as good as the double priced one at Macy&#x27;s , Ulta and Sephora stores.</li>
    <li> The smell of the cologne does not last long. It seems it&#x27;s more water based than oil based.</li>
    <li> My wife is the one that picks this kind of stuff out for me, because really she is the one I want to impress. This stuff is great &amp; I like it as well.</li>
    <li> I really liked this....Plus it came earlier....</li>
    <li> The bottle was all black not that teal color as displayed</li>
    <li> I own quite a bit of cologne, and I&#x27;m not sure anything smells as good as this.</li>
    <li> Great scent, really elegant and stays for a while, awesome price, will buy it again once I need a new one!</li>
    <li> Awesome!, Smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> he loves it. highly recommend you get a sample from the store first before buying but i love this scent.</li>
    <li> doesnt last for 12 hours on my skin but it stays on for a whole shift at work.  I  like all three versions of this cologne.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 as gifts for 2 separate people and both were very happy. In fact they both wear it daily!</li>
    <li> The perfume arrived on time, but i requested hide price and wrapped as a gift, but thats not happen, so it was kind of disappointed... everything else was ok</li>
    <li> The cologne smells fantastic.....but, it does wear off rather quickly.</li>
    <li> So amazing! 100% authentic and the scent is extremely attractive. Great product!</li>
    <li> Fantastic and plenty of compliments too! Great smell!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, brand new, smells great</li>
    <li> the ladies love it you would think it has pheromones in it compliments all nightI would definitely recommend its the best one Gucci has</li>
    <li> It smells slightly different from the mall sample and not as strong. I think it actually lasts a little bit longer than the sample though. If you want one that has a very strong smell and lasts all day the Gucci intense is a better choice. It smells great as well but has a slightly different smell. This stuff seems more like a bottle of pheremones. It isn&#x27;t a real strong perfumey smell that everyone is going to pick up on from across the room. It is a little more subtle, many, sensual. When I sampled it at the mall I got a slightly different impression. I guess their samples have a stronger smell more perfumey smell. And there is a reason for that. You generally have a hard time smelling yourself. Like if I spray myself with this after a few minutes I don&#x27;t really smell it on me anymore unless I put my nose on it, but other people can smell it. Also like I said it is more of a manly pheremone type smell instead of some over powering cologne smell so it isn&#x27;t as in your face. If you want that really bold smell they have the intense and it wont disappoint. There is also the regular Gucci.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to last maybe 4 hours at full power. Then it mellows out where its still there but even less noticeable and less strong. The lingering smell will last all day. You probably wont notice it yourself though. Other people probably wont notice it unless they are close to you. Like I said its not a scent that someone is going to pick up on across the hall. Overall I think the quality is premium. It&#x27;s better stuff than the lower priced scents and its about the same quality as the other premium scents. The reason I liked this smell was because it was more manly and sensual and less flowery/perfumy than some other scents. But maybe the few complaints here are because people expected something different.</li>
    <li> Ordered this fragrance for my husband and teenage son both. Very nice fragrance. Would highly recommend. Item was as described.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s bad quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i got a Broken cologne :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and i need a new one ASAP when it is available</li>
    <li> This cologne is definitely the favorite in a house full of men, cool thing is you can come online and buy it for way less than at a department store&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be one of those chumps that tries to justify spending all that extra money when you can buy it directly from the manufacture right here on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can save yourself a trip to the mall and some sales speech from a highly attractive women who wants to tell you about how sexy you smell when you know she wouldn&#x27;t give you the time of day</li>
    <li> Execelent product, The shipping was on time.</li>
    <li> Incredible cologne has to be one of my favorites</li>
    <li> My new favorite fragrance!</li>
    <li> Great smelling cologne. Girls really know it smells good up close. Cannot really smell it from more than 2-3 feet away. Would prefer it to reach 4-5 feet.</li>
    <li> This was a blind buy for me. I am kind of disappointed. I wanted to like this based off of all of the reviews, but I really just do not like how this smells on me. I have resorted to using it as a room spray. The notes listed are &amp;#34;green,&amp;#34; orange blossom, coriander, patchouli, lavender, neroli and cedar but it smells very dank and dark to me. If those notes interest you then go for it, but I strongly suggest you try this one before you buy it.</li>
    <li> The real deal. One of my favorites.  Definitely recommended</li>
    <li> Very happy with this fragrance. Gucci&#x27;s the best!! I wear it to work and it smells so good at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> My man definitely likes this parfume. We always get it from Amazon and he smells great. A must have!</li>
    <li> The bottle is full and everything looks GREAT . Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle from Macy&#x27;s at a price two times the one posted here on Amazon, that was a bad choice! The smell is amazing but it hardly lasts for even an hour! If it stayed longer, I would give it a solid 5 star.</li>
    <li> Great bargain and my son uses it</li>
    <li> A mens must have scent!</li>
