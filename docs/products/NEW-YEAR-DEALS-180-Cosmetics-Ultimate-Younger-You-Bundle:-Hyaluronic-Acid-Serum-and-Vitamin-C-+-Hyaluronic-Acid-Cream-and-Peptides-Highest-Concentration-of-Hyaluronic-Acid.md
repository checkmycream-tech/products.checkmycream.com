<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have started on my second set.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it  week but I like it so far. The redness seems less obvious and my skin is soft without the heavy cream feeling.</li>
    <li> Never got to use the product because when my package arrived, one of the bottles that was glass had broken and all the product had leaked into the box</li>
    <li> This is a really cute set. It comes with .5oz Hyaluronic Acid Serum with vitamin c and a 1oz Hyaluronic Acid Cream with peptides. These two products go great together. You apply the serum first, let it dry, then follow up with the moisturizing cream. Very simple to use. Each product comes in a gorgeous little frosted glass bottle with a dropper applicator top! This would make a very cute gift. I have to admit that I&#x27;m not too pleased with it containing benzoyl alcohol which is typically used as a drying agent, but I can look past that. Great set! (I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
    <li> The first thing you&#x27;ll notice about this product is the packaging. The box is really sophisticated looking and I am in love with the bottles. I keep them on display on my vanity, because they are so classy looking. I was already a huge fan of 180 Cosmetics when I got this set. Inside is Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Acid Serum + Vitamin C + Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Cream + Peptides. I use the serum first let it soak in for a few minutes then apply the cream. I do this every night before bed and my skin has never looked better. It really is a face lift in a bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
    <li> I love it when applying immediately feel the difference in my skin .. it feels more hydrated and I started to use in winter weather. definitely would use it again.</li>
    <li> My review is one based on extensive consumer and research experience of high end top quality skincare. This is a product that quickly absorbs into your skin. Both the serum and the cream. Excellent quality products. The results are outstanding.</li>
    <li> One of the best product I&#x27;ve ever tried, I recommend truly work.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love using these 2 products! First off, the packaging is beautiful and high end. The bottles are nice thick glass and the dropper is glass as well. The serum goes on smooth and soaks in almost immediately. I only have to use 2 drops for my whole face. The lotion is in a nice pump bottle. It has the slightest, delicate floral scent to it. It is silky and goes on easily. I only use one pump for my entire face and my skin feels soft and smooth. I can immediately put my make up on after applying. I feel like my fine lines right under my eye area are less noticeable and my skin looks brighter and dewy. I think these bottles will last a long time but I&#x27;ll definitely be repurchasing after I use these up!</li>
    <li> The combination of these two products is awesome. The serum feels so nice and smooth on my face. Combined with the moisturizer my face feels so hydrated and</li>
    <li> I have been  using  these two  products  for approximately a month now.  I realized after a recent  facial that my skin care regimen  was extremely  lacking.  I have  noticed  a big difference in my skin.  While  wrinkles have  not completely disappeared, they are becoming  less noticeable. I also have a couple of  sun spots on my face and they are getting  lighter.  My skin is approaching 40 and is  very sensitive.  This winter my skin has become prone to eczema  and this product  does cause irritation  for me.  I also feel the price is extremely  reasonable.  My local spa was selling  something  similar  for around 6 times as much.  If the results i am seeing  after only a month of use are any indicator of the long term use, the I am looking  forward to seeing  future results.</li>
    <li> I have only used 10 days but I see a little difference  I did not know or realize how much you have to use, my bottle will not last 30 days as I thought.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. I would not use anything else. Smooths fine lines and feels great. Will definitely be back. :-) fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This works amazing &amp; my skin just sucks it up!  I love how my skin responds to this &amp; I wish they sold the cream in a large container so I could use it as s body lotion!</li>
    <li> Great product, by the 2nd day I could feel my face tightening a little.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love it! When applying, I immediately feel the difference in my skin .. it feels more hydrated and I started to use in winter weather. I would definitely use it again and the beautiful box makes it a great gift set that any woman would be happy to receive!</li>
    <li> If I could give this product 20 stars, I would. The serum and the cream are both AMAZING! They leave my face feeling super soft. They are the perfect base for make-up. When wearing the serum and cream, my make-up goes on flawless. This will definitely be on my birthday and Christmas wish lists for life!</li>
    <li> Just got it but love the feel of it on my skin</li>
    <li> Serum vial was cracked and soaked all over the packaging.  Package seemed okay otherwise, so I assume it was packed  with a crack already in it. Okay, makes my skin feel soft, but no perceptible difference in wrinkles or crow&#x27;s feet.  Works about as well as any aloe product, but is WAY more expensive.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> My mom keep using this product for months，she said  it was very useful and working for her skin!Also ,the seller is very kind and responsible .</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used a week and already my skin looks and feels better.  like the price...good producct</li>
    <li> Love the product. I would recommend it for anyone.</li>
    <li> Like the product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I love this product so far. This is my second order. I have seen improvement in my skin and even trouble areas that have not resolved with the use of other products. I have begun to notice slight changes to areas that nothing else seem to work on, like dark spots, redness, and hyperkeratosis. I will continue to order this product. I only wish I could purchase it in a larger container since I plan on using it twice daily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read since purchasing the serum that vitamin C is not stable in a clear container.</li>
    <li> After trying the 180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Acid Serum + Vitamin C this reviewer stated ‘Hyaluronic acid is a constituent of most facial cosmetic creams, lotions and potions. it plays an important role in the normal epidermis. HA also has crucial functions in the reepithelization process due to several of its properties. It serves as an integral part of the extracellular matrix of basal keratinocytes, which are major constituents of the epidermis; its free-radical scavenging function and its role in keratinocyte proliferation and migration. In normal skin, HA is found in relative high concentrations in the basal layer of the epidermis where proliferating keratinocytes are found. CD44 is collocated with HA in the basal layer of epidermis where additionally it has been shown to be preferentially expressed on plasma membrane facing the HA-rich matrix pouches. Maintaining the extracellular space and providing an open, as well as hydrated, structure for the passage of nutrients are the main functions of HA in epidermis. HA content increases at the presence of retinoic acid (vitamin A). The proposed effects of retinoic acid against skin photo-damage and aging may be correlated, at least in part, with an increase of skin HA content, giving rise to increase of tissue hydration. Combined with the skin-firming powers of hyaluronic acid, oxygen promotes cell renewal, increases circulation, and energizes the skin and delivering abundant levels of hydration for smooth, supple, wrinkle-free skin, accelerating the skin&#x27;s natural repair process, boosts skin&#x27;s elasticity and density and preserves skin&#x27;s youthful tone and texture with the aid of vitamin C - all of which enhance the presence of HA.’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The complete satisfaction with the serum encouraged me to try the cream form of the above, and fortunately 180 Cosmetic provides this bundle – the serum with vitamin C and the cr&amp;egrave;me with peptides.  The difference is further enhancement using the two products together – first the serum, let it absorb, then the cr&amp;egrave;me. It really works well on crow&#x27;s feet smile lines and on the upper lip for smokers. No it is not the same as a cosmetic procedure with radio frequency, laser of CO2, but it is much less expensive and even if you are having periodic skin resurfacing, in between treatments with this HA serum and cr&amp;egrave;me will heighten the effects of your procedure. This is an excellent product - safe, easy to apply, and relatively inexpensive for what you get!

    <li> This lifts and tightens, I can feel it working, I feel the tightness and the lift. I use it with another face, skin care regime and the two skin care products used together is miraculous. Truly it is.</li>
    <li> HIGHLY RECCOMEND...diffinitely see a difference.</li>
    <li> Great product noticed difference after using 3 days. Definite reordering.</li>
    <li> Came back for more! Great price!</li>
    <li> Feels good on your skin....moisturizes nicely.......</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for that special woman in your life or to pamper yourself. This box is very presentable and elegant looking. The bottles are gorgeous glass bottles with gold writing. It looks like something you would buy at a 5 Star Salon and Spa for more than $100! This set includes a Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Acid Serum + Vitamin C and a Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Cream + Peptides. The serum contains natural ingredients and is enriched with Vitamin C. It helps fight the signs of aging like fine lines and wrinkles. The Hyaluronic cream is awesome as I&#x27;ve never had a cream with Hyaluronic acid in it. It helps with fine lines and wrinkles and also makes your skin softer and smoother. This combination set made my skin look so soft, like a babies bottom. It looked healthier and I noticed less wrinkles on my neck. My sensitive skin had no adverse side effects and it didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts. This is great for the aging woman that&#x27;s ready to get her youthful skin back! *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
    <li> This set is a great value and is gift ready! You get two awesome products that work beautifully.</li>
    <li> My wife used the full bottle, but didn&#x27;t improve the skin at all.  The cream takes a while to penetrate in the skin. Won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> I was very impressed when I opened the amazon box. It&#x27;s packaged very attractively. While it is not large, it is nice. The glass bottle for the moisturizer has weight to it and is a very nice size. The Hylauronic Acid is much smaller but still proportionate.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for personal use or as a small gift. I was lucky enough to receive this set at a discounted price.&lt;br /&gt;I did do a patch test behind my ear before applying to my face because I have sensitive skin. Both product feel nice on my skin and haven&#x27;t broken me out at all.</li>
    <li> I really love this product and will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I am a true believer of this product and I have never tried it before. After only using it for a week, not only did I notice the changes, but everyone else has made comments on how well my skin looks and how much younger I look. I will definitely keep buying this product!!</li>

    <li> Very pleased with this product and have decided to re-order and see how much of an improvement I will see with continued use.  Recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product and excellent price. This is my third time to order this vit c serum. It is absorbed immediately and keeps my skin soft as well as lightening sun spots This is my second order of the serum. I will definitely be ordering the lotion as well next order</li>
    <li> It makes my face look smooth, luminescent, soft and dewy when I add a tinted moisturizer to my regime...</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!! Love the price, the product, the fast delivery, love everything about this product. I&#x27;m 26 and recently had my first baby. My skin changed after that, I have proof that this product works! It&#x27;s amazing! I receive it within two days after purchase. After using it only two days my skin was back to normal. And even better looking. I even went to Ulta and returned a foundation cause I don&#x27;t need to wear make up anymore!!!!</li>
    <li> Really nice Hyaluronic Acid cream and Vitamin c serum set. They leave my face feeling soft and hydrated. I apply the serum first let it dry for approx 20 seconds and then apply the cream. Really easy to use. Nice formulations. My face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy after. The bottles are beautiful and very nice. But the outer packaging leaves something to be desired. The cardboard is not sturdy enough to hold those nice bottles. My box was open and the bottles were just rolling around the amazon box. It&#x27;s a miracle they didn&#x27;t get broken. Other than that, great product. *sample provided to review.</li>
    <li> I use this branch for a couple of years and I recommend it to friends. I love it and the price is good.</li>
    <li> The set is professionally packaged. It is enticing from the moment you open it. It looks and feel luxurious and very high end. One is a serum that help with bringing back some tightness and tone to your skin. You can use this both morning and night. The second is a cream and thick nice scent. Not over powering but should be aware there is a slight one. I have noticed with the set tighter skin looking more rested even though I am not. Fine lines and wrinkles are starting to disappear. I am sure with more time this will do even more. I have tried other things in this companies line and I am loving it. If you are getting to be more concerned about your anti-aging and skin give this a try. If you can find the other things in this line try them along with this. I have been using this along with their other stuff at the same time. Make sure you go down into the neck area and then up-swipe one time to the face. When you keep pulling downward it is pushing your skin that way. As an active blogger i received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Since I started using the Younger You Bundle, I have noticed a huge difference in my appearance. I have been getting a lot of compliments on how young my skin is looking. My wrinkles have been disappearing and I feel wonderful. This bundle should be in every home!</li>
