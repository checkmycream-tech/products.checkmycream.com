<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love these colors! Great for multiple clean, neutral tone looks.</li>
    <li> I love this pallete so much. So creamy, blendable and pigmented. Package came earlier than expected shipping date, which was awesome.</li>
    <li> If you love neutrals than this may be the palette for you. I absolutely adore everything Too Faced and this palette is another I can add to my collection. I purchased mine from the Too Faced website and shipping was horrible but I think that had more to do with UPS not actually TF. This neutral matte palette just gives me LIFE!</li>
    <li> Love the colors and the fact that all the shades finishes are matte. You can get away with a really subtle natural look, or get crazy with a really smokey night-time look. Too Faced is known for their quality, and this pallet lives up to the standard.</li>
    <li> I love it, I finally found my eye shadow....;)</li>
    <li> Excellent colors. Beautiful finish.</li>
    <li> amazing! looks and feels beautiful, great color combination, mix and match, love love love it!</li>
    <li> Colors are perfect for aging eyes ...51 and rockiin&#x27; my glam!</li>
    <li> Phenomenal Product! I&#x27;m an avid user of Too Faced eye palettes and this one is a MUST HAVE  the price is great for the variety of shades and consistentcy is top notch! All of these colors blend very well and contain high pigment!  Will definitely be buying this one for my daughters in the near future!</li>
    <li> Great product but bit of slow delivery. I love the colors, texture and pigmentation!</li>
    <li> I love too faced eyeshadows. This pallet doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> I have Kat Von D&#x27;s Saint palette which is a gorgeous brown, neutral, and buttery set of eye shadows with mostly shimmery colors. However I was looking for something matte that would be good for my oily skin and I found the perfect one! I am Asian with tanned skin, and I think all these colors could go with any skin tone and can be built up for night time looks. The eye shadows do get a little chalky when you dip your brush into them, but that&#x27;s expected from matte and to me is not a big deal. I use Mac brushes so everything goes on super easily and is very blendable. I also like the tin it comes in - way better than the cardboard box the Too Faced palettes used to come in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend!! Also, I always use the Urban Decay primer potion before applying eye makeup.</li>
    <li> I am addicted to Too Faced eyeshadow. It blends so well and stays all day. The matte naturals look so great day or night. I am so excited to add this pallet to my collection :)</li>
    <li> Great colors, pigmented, arrived in great condition.</li>
    <li> I love love love this palate! The palate comes with various styles and instructions- it&#x27;s super easy for beginners too! I&#x27;m actually thinking of switching to only too faced products!</li>
    <li> I bought some other makeup on Amazon for my niece for her 11th birthday, and then went and found some links to makeup tutorials on-line to give her in the birthday card.  In reviewing the videos I discovered I have been doing my makeup wrong for years.  I have hooded eyes, which means to make my eyes look less hooded, and really pull attention to my eyes I should wear matte makeup.  I looked at my makeup drawer and everything I owned was sparkle or shimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I headed to Amazon and bought a variate if matte eye shadow pallets; this one has become my favorite by far.  The pigments are silky and rich, I put them on in the morning and they last all day with no creasing.  The colors are neutral but not dull, and my eyes look great.  Because the pallet is neutral it goes with absolutely everything, so I can play with my lipstick color and not have to worry about looking like a clown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this pallet to everyone, even if you don&#x27;t have hooded eyes, the colors just work.</li>
    <li> Need a black colour but it is fabulous</li>
    <li> Love love love this pallet. Colors are perfect for everyday wear and very pigmented. Highly recommend for girls that do natural look makeup.</li>
    <li> Authentic Product! Love it!!! I use it everyday! Very smooth &amp; creamy consistency. Easy to blend!</li>
    <li> love this, pricey though</li>
    <li> The colors are amazing! I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
