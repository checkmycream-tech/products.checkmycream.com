<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This lotion smells so yummy!!! It helps give you an awesome tan. It doesn&#x27;t have a high amount of bronzer in it, so you won&#x27;t have any streaks after using. I bought this lotion at the salon before, and this is the exact same for much cheaper of course.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fast this came in the mail!  It smells wonderful.  I work in a tanning salon and we just got this in.  I feel bad, but I wasn&#x27;t about to pay full price for this so I got it from here and also ordered Designer Skin&#x27;s Aphrodisiac.  Both are wonderful!</li>
    <li> I rate tanning lotions based on three components: Smell (5/5), Skin Texture (5/5), Skin Color (2/5)  The smell of Masquerade is AMAZING. It was very yummy, light and feminine and I had someone ask me what perfume I wear after tanning one day. It leaves the texture of your skin moisturized but not greasy. It&#x27;s great as a stand-alone lotion in this way. It does not enhance the color of your tan as it contains very little tint/bronzer and moderately aided the natural tanning process.</li>
    <li> Honestly this didn&#x27;t work as well on me as it did on everyone else. The girls at the salon told me I would love it. They said it work great on them and it was the one they will use from now on. I didn&#x27;t see results for like three days. However, everyone is diffrent so maybe this one just will not work for me. &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product and LOW price!  It came quickly.  It was still sealed, it smell good, and works great. I have no doubt that it is the real deal.</li>
    <li> Did not like this lotion at all. It smells strange and gave me zero additional color. As a matter of fact, the tanning lotion I bought from Walgreens worked better than this.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It smells great and gives you nice color. You don&#x27;t feel like you need to shower right after you tan. The only downside is you want to use it so much that the 10 oz bottle doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
    <li> I bought this from my tanning salon but since it has no reviews online I shall be the first!!! lol I loveeee this lotion it is my second favorite designer skin product after luminary!!! It will get you SUPER DARK, SUPER FAST. It has no silicone in it but it is super moisturizing and makes your skin look and feel great. Also it smells SOOO good before tanning and after tanning which is really important and the price isnt disgusting. Also alittle goes a long way so u dont need to layer on</li>
    <li> Masquerade is similar in texture to Aphrodisiac but with a bronzer.  It&#x27;s a good moisturizer and nice bronzer but I&#x27;m not a super fan of the smell.</li>
    <li> After having been a Swedish Beauty fan forever, I switched to Designer Skin and absolutely love this product!! It goes on well, doesn&#x27;t leave any orange coloring after tanning, smells great and makes you look super tan! Would purchase again!</li>
    <li> I also was sucked into buying it at my tanning salon but it works great and should for the $78 price I paid.  This online price is amazing and I will be buying a second bottle soon.  Only complaint is I wish it was a tingle for an even better tan.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells GREAT (even after tanning).  It also makes your skin feel so smooth.  I love this lotion and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great vendor...fast shipping. Masquerade is \\&quot;okay\\&quot;, not as great as it&#x27;s hype. This vendor has better and less expensive products.  All beating tanning salon prices by far.</li>
    <li> I am a very light skinned Latina and I have to say this product works great. It gave me a nice caramel color (not orange at all)! And it smells really nice too :-) I love it because it works for indoor tanning as well as outdoor tanning. And I also like it because it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry. Overall, really great product.</li>
    <li> Wow!! I was impressed by the lovely scent of this product, after only one use, I noticed a difference.  It is the very first time I own a tanning lotion that doesn&#x27;t make you stink afterwards, even my husband noticed my sweet new scent.  It is fairly moisturizing, and I had quick tanning results, overall, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Point blank. Everywhere I looked it was like $65 but I got it on here for $30 what a steal. I was very pale...I got this put it on and got into a 10 minute bed..I came out and was no longer pale! No burning at all! I can&#x27;t wait to use it again! Get this it is great!</li>
    <li> I bought this a while ago and wasnt excited about it but wasnt dissapointed either.     I sometimes take rhodiola extract when I need extra stamina for studying and energy. I never noticed that this tanning product had rhodiola but realized that this lotion gives extra energy and feelings of contentment because of the rhodiola extraxt is asborbed through the skin. That is a neat added benefit but just be careful using this cream at night as it could keep you up - day time is perfect especially before a workout. I really like this lotion and it gets me very tan and it has a very nice smell.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing!  It smells fantastic and gets you tan super fast!  Also, I paid half the price on amazon than what my tanning salon wanted me to pay!</li>
    <li> This stuffs amazinggggg! I got a sample of it and knew I had to get it. It smells soooooooo good. Its incredibly moisturizing, but not greasy at ALL! This stuff my favorite. &amp; it got me so dark.</li>
    <li> Has a GREAT before and after tan smell unlike most indoor tanning lotions. Only reason why I give it a 3 out of 5 is because it&#x27;s a bit sticky and does not go on as smooth as other brands I have used in the past. For color I give it a 3 out of 5... All in all I&#x27;ll stick with Satin D Sol</li>
    <li> Not one of my favorites from Designer Skin... The smell is alright but that&#x27;s about all I was impressed with. I didn&#x27;t feel like it did much for my color. It would probably be a good starting lotion but I don&#x27;t like it for the level of color I have now.. Almost felt like it was making me loose some of my tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend Paramour (downside: has a pretty strong perfume sent) over this lotion if you are looking for a bronzer that gives good color without the DHA in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one remindes me of all the hype that surrounded Bellezza a few years back.. I wasn&#x27;t impressed with that one either despite everyone raving about it.</li>
    <li> I used this lotion the day it came in the mail. A difference in color appeared after the first use. I have very sensitive skin and so far this is a very good lotion for not only color, but skin health as well.</li>
    <li> I do not really care for this product. It doesn&#x27;t bronze, and the lotion is very thick. It may work better for someone with a little bit of a darker skin tone, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
    <li> I was suckered into this one at my tanning salon, so if you&#x27;re reading this, please take advantage of the deals you&#x27;ll find here!  Price notwithstanding, this lotion is awesome!  First, it smells like Hawaiian Punch or something equally delicious, but more importantly, I saw results immediately.  I had taken a few months off from tanning and am back to re-building my base tan.  Today was only my third time tanning since my break, and I came out of the Level 3 stand up bed, after using Masquerade, and actually saw tan lines.  It usually takes me a good week to build noticable lines.  This stuff is like magic!</li>
    <li> I just went tanning and bought this because my usual tanning lotion has not come in from the mail yet, so I needed to substitute. I really do like the smell of this stuff! Unfortunately, I had to pay $9 for it at the salon when I&#x27;ve seen samples like this sell for $2 or less here online. Anyways, this product dries easily and you don&#x27;t have to wait too long before getting into the tanning bed. I had one of those stickers on my hips to keep track of my progress and after one session, I already have a tan line with the help of this product. It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> this is a great tanner especially because I don&#x27;t like the stuff that turns you orange when you tan. this tans good and no orange</li>
    <li> I bought the packet of Masquerade at the tanning salon because I wasn&#x27;t sure which lotion I wanted to invest in. I wanted to make sure it was worth my money, and healthy for my skin. I had read all of the reviews for Masquerade and thought... I NEED to try this! I tanned a few times with it, and I&#x27;m slightly disappointed. People say it smells great, but personally, I didn&#x27;t like the smell. It smelled like a mix of bad oranges and other fruit gone bad, and I felt like I smelled bad after I got done tanning. This does make you tan, but not as bronze as I would like to be. I used it on my face, and my face was more red than tan. I went back to the salon and bought Ceremony because my friend that worked there said she used it and loved it. It is considerably cheaper than Masquerade, and I love it ten times more! If you want to get a nice bronze color that smells good, I would highly suggest Ceremony. It&#x27;s cheaper and so worth it! This is an honest review, from customer to customer. Don&#x27;t spend more $ on Masquerade, it&#x27;s not worth it!</li>
    <li> I have purchased tanning lotions from Amazon sellers before and they had the plastic seal around the bottle. I am confused to why this product doesn&#x27;t have one, it makes me think that it is Not brand new... or possible someone tampered with it! I am concerned about this because the tanning salon I go to says to be careful about certain sellers who take out some of the lotion and add another cheap lotion to it... which makes me wonder if this is the real product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Masquerade, and for a number of reasons:  1.) It gets you great color  2.) It smells really good before you put it on AND after you are done tanning. Some lotions make you smell awful when you come out of your tanning session and put you in need of a shower immediately. With Masquerade, I have actually been in the grocery store after going tanning and had people stop me to tell me how good I smelled.   3.) It isn&#x27;t the slightest bit greasy and is very moisturizing.  4.) It has just the right amount of bronzer in it so that if you wanted to \\&quot;cheat\\&quot; a little bit, you could put some on before going out somewhere and give yourself an instant boost of color. As I said before, it smells great and isn&#x27;t at all greasy, so even if you don&#x27;t use it that day for tanning purposes and just for some quick color for a night out or an important event, you will be just fine and probably complimented on how you smell.  5.) Buying it from Amazon will save you a ton of money as opposed to buying it from your tanning salon. I first bought Masquerade at my tanning salon and was paying around 45 dollars for the bottle. Out of curiosity, I looked it up on Amazon one night and found out I could have been buying it here for $23.00 a bottle. Definitely going to buy my lotion here from now on.     The ONLY slightly negative thing I can think of about this lotion is that you don&#x27;t want to leave it sitting on your face for a while after you have tanned. Even if you don&#x27;t shower soon after tanning, you should wash your face. I&#x27;ve had a few minor breakouts later in the day after tanning, and I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s because this really thick lotion tends to clog my pores. Not saying it isn&#x27;t safe to use on your face, because I do every time I tan -- just wash your face when you get home.     Buy Masquerade! You will love it!</li>
    <li> This lotion has been just ok for me. It absorbs quickly enough, the odor isn&#x27;t atrocious, and I tanned decently while using it. However, the after tan smell was funkadelic at best, and my entire body felt as though I&#x27;d been slathered up to be deep fried. I certainly couldn&#x27;t go from the tanner to run an errand, it would have to be my last stop before the shower. The lotion simply wasn&#x27;t functional enough for me and not worth the money. I definitely recommend non-silicone based lotions, however, and, if you&#x27;re in the market to give something different a try, I recommend \\&quot;Queen\\&quot; by Designer Skin. Does what this one promises, and smells a thousand times better doing it.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what you would pay for in a tanning salon and pay well over 100.00 for. Shipping was fast, have already lathered up and visited local salon. Love this product. Will order again when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. It smells wonderful and really delivers a lovely tan. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Would recommend this to anyone. And great prices on Amazon. A friend of mine paid $66 for it in stores (ouch!)</li>
    <li> Great smelling, fast acting tanning lotion! I love that I don&#x27;t feel like I smell like tanning lotion when I finish tanning- this lotion has a light, tropical smell.</li>
    <li> I used to work at a tanning salon. It is true that its a little risky buying tanning lotions from Amazon, or any online retailers. Much like buying cheap perfume or knock-off handbags in China Town, they tend to be made with cheaper materials. BUT my friend got it off amazon and its the exact same as my lotion from the salon i work at. This is the BEST tanning lotion. and I have tried almost all of them at least once. nothing beats this. I used it outside as well (you can use most tanning lotions outside, just NOT tinglers) it mostuirizes your skin as well, which it the most important thing. SERIOUSLY worth the money.</li>
    <li> The lotion works.  This lotions protects your skin and keeps your tan looking great!  It is a great lotion!  I didn&#x27;t care much for the smell, although I&#x27;d say most women will probably like it. It wasn&#x27;t way over powering either.  I dont like too flowery of smells.  It wasn&#x27;t so bad that I couldn&#x27;t use it, it just wasn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
    <li> I worked at a tanning salon in college to make some extra booze money. When I started seeing girls coming in with Obsidian, Black and Phoenician, I started wondering how many trust fund babies (PUN INTENDED!) went to my school and how they could afford these 90 dollar bottles of lotion. A quick check to the client&#x27;s sales history (to inquire which of my co-workers was making bank on her product commission) showed me that none of these high-end bottles were purchased at our salon. I asked one of the girls where she got her bottle, and she told me she buys ALL of her tanning lotion online. (RED FLAG!!!) We were trained to warn clients against purchasing bottles online, and while I recognize that bottles have been tampered with in the past, I can assure buyers that this is the real deal. This lotion is the same, purply, yummy smelling Masquerade I used in college. Tanners, this lotion not only gives you instant, deep color, but it makes your skin feel like it is aging backwards, and does not leave you feeling greasy and oily. I would buy packets of this when I wanted to tan the weekends my bf came to visit so I didn&#x27;t have to shower ;) I no longer tan due to a skin cancer scare, but I bought this for the moisturizing and the smell. It was also cheaper than it would have been with my 50% employee discount. For those of you looking to get tan quick for a bargain, BUY HERE!</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product to others- it stained my hands bright orange after one use and I washed my hands thoroughly TWICE before getting into the tanning bed. the only reason I gave it two stars is because sealed tanning lotions is a great company and I would definitely give them 5 stars for their customer service&amp; satisfaction (:</li>
    <li> This lotion is pretty thick, but spreads and melts into the skin quite nicely. The smell is lovely, an orange/musk. Doesnt leave a bad after tan smell.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your skin feeling smooth and supple. Delivers instant color!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for almost ten years and have been using Designer Skin products for about 5 years. I love their products. This is the first DS lotion I&#x27;ve been dissapointed with. It smells nice and feels nice but I&#x27;m not satisfied with the color (or lack thereof). It&#x27;s not a bad lotion but it&#x27;s not one of Designer Skin&#x27;s better lotions. I would get Spellbound or Black before getting Masquerade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having a hard time getting a tan. I used Eternal Twilight for about three weeks and didn&#x27;t get very far with it. I asked a tanning consultant about what they thought I should use. First she suggested Designer Skin Black, just for a sample it was $13.00, definitely not feeling that price. She said the next best thing was Masquerade. It smells great, and I got a tiny bit of color from it. Just not as much as promised. It could be better.</li>
    <li> Designer Skin Masquerade lotion works so great for building a base tan! I have tried other lotions that made my skin break out in a rash, but this lotion was perfect for me and smells good too! I absolutely recommend this lotion!!</li>
    <li> I got told by the guy at my tanning salon that ordering from amazon especially for tanning lotion is a big risk he said my lotion will probably be crap and not actually be the right lotion...he said he ordered luminary off of here and it didnt tan him...well he&#x27;s still not even a lil tan so i think it was him not the lotion lol. Well I&#x27;ve read great reviews on the product so i bought it and I love it. The smell is what gets me.fruity and perfume scent to me.Tans great also. Im especially happy with it shipping to me. It came to me 2 days earlier than expected. and it was in a box with bubble wrap so it was nice and snug, I also got a sample of Angel moisturizer with it. I&#x27;m all around very pleased. The same lotion was [...] at my salon. I think the guy at my salon was just mad I didnt buy from him and but some $$ in his pocket. Im happy with my purchase and I WILL buy from amazon again.</li>
    <li> I have to start out by saying I&#x27;ve tried at least 5 different indoor tanning solutions and this one is by far the best. Not only does it smell good, it actually WORKS. I got dark very fast with this. I think it may have a bronzer in it but it has never left my hands discolored or left any streaks on me anywhere (I always wash my hands after application of lotions). I really do love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! Best product ever! You can&#x27;t stop making this product!</li>
    <li> I will buy again. It is  much cheaper then any tanning salon. love it , nice consistency. good amount for the price.</li>
    <li> I swear, this is the best tanning lotion for men. I am a man, and I always go tanning with this lotion right before a date because girls go nuts and want to &amp;#34;make out&amp;#34; every time I have this tanning lotion smell on me. I am telling you, try it and see for yourself.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used for price, smell, texture, and the color it gives you. It really moisturizes your skin, especially during the winter. Also you look dark right after you come out and your skin feels soft and smooth. Zero After Tan Odor and it kind of has a nice musk scent to it.</li>
    <li> Have only used this a couple times since purchasing, but so far so good. Also, has not turned the palms of my hands that orange color as mentioned by a couple others. Nice smell also!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I have used this for a few months now and haven&#x27;t had any problems. I love the smell and the way it moisturizes my skin. There are a lot of products that seem to lose their moisturizing effect after tanning, but I have never had to lather lotion on immediately after tanning with Masquerade. I have also noticed that after showering other lotions bronzing agent was left on my towel, which is gross. Again, I haven&#x27;t had this problem with this lotion. It was affordable to buy online and I paid about a third of the price, which is compared to $70 at my gym. If you are looking for an all around good lotion this would be the product to buy! I&#x27;m 100% happy with this product and my color! I love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion! It smells great, even after tanning. The consistency is perfect- not sticky, not greasy, just very moisturizing which I love. I decided to put a sticker on my hip the first day I tried this lotion, just to see how much difference it would make, and after 15 minutes of tanning I had a noticeable tan line. After just one session! I also love the fact that I saved so much money by purchasing this online rather than from a salon. I&#x27;m definitely a fan of this lotion and would buy again. :)</li>
    <li> And works well. Those are probably the two good things I can say about this lotion. However, it&#x27;s extremely greasy on my skin, before and after tanning. I don&#x27;t even put a lot on, just enough to cover my skin. But I feel oily and nasty the rest of the day :\</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion! It smells absolutely amazing before and after. No burnt skin smell! The rapid release bronzers get you dark super fast. And the shea and cocoa butters in there leave your skin feeling like silk and super moisturized.</li>
    <li> I am a tanning lotion freak. I am in love with tanning lotion on top of giving me a nice glow it smells amazing almost like fruit loops but not really. Its a nice smooth lotion that after tanning you won&#x27;t be grossed out by the smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about a month ago and it has worked great. I have a very pale skin tone but am getting ready for a cruise to the Caribbean so I started tanning. I bought this lotion at my salon for $40 (on sale) so I would recommend buying from here. The first couple of uses the product tingled on my skin while in the bed, it doesnt anymore but I may just be used to it now. I do not tan on a regular basis, just when going on vacation and usually it takes a lot of my base tan to develop but this lotion helped me get a great tone in just 4 or 5 visits. The lotion smells great and doesnt turn my hands orange as others have mentioned. If I had one complaint, it would be that the lotion stopper falls out into the top every couple of uses. It is an easy fix and wouldnt stop me from buying this product again. Another great thing about this lotion is that you can use it outdoors as well!</li>
    <li> not a bad lotion, it actually helped tanned my pale husband. The smell is so so, the bronzer is good for a beginner. I would say this lotion would be a good start for the tanning season, but would need something stronger once the base tan is present.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! It smells great before and after I tan, and my color is awesome!! Great buy from Amazon! Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion! It works very good and gets you dark quickly, it also makes you smell really good after tanning</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands, but have to say this is the best!  I&#x27;m ordering some more right now!  Goes on smooth, spreads well (a little goes a long way), and you are visibly darker each time you tan.  Smells great (not too strong) and leaves skin moisturized and supple.  No more brand-hopping for me.  This is the stuff!</li>
    <li> I used this after being super pale during winter (my friends joke that I&#x27;m a ghost...) and it gave me a good base tan.  It did not get me past that though.  I shared the bottle with another extra-white friend and she only got a little pink and is still pale.  I chose it because of its smell, fruity but not overpowering.  It smells great when you put it on but does not smell as good afterwards.  Not bad, but not great.  I would recommend this for anyone looking to develop a base tan, but if you&#x27;re looking to get very dark this lotion is not the one for you.</li>
    <li> loved it, smooth and smells amazing!</li>
    <li> The product works great and a pleasant scent.  It&#x27;s absolutely fabulous.  It feels great on the skin and afterwards as well.</li>
    <li> I do love the smell of this lotion!! I especially love the feeling of this lotion. It goes on smooth, &amp; it made my body real soft!! It gave me a great base tan. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for advanced tanners. After a while I kinda felt like it stopped working. I bought it last year when I first started tanning. (I wish I would have bought this from amazon cause I paid almost double). It worked great at first. After a few weeks of first tanning every day to then 2-3x a week I felt like it stopped working. I wasn&#x27;t getting any darker &amp; then switched lotions (mostly samples I was buying at the salon). I let my daughter use this lotion last summer, but for outside. (I know they say not to do that but really what&#x27;s the difference.) she loved it &amp; we both noticed results within a couple of days of the few nice days we had lol!</li>
    <li> I love this rapid release + bronzer lotion. Buyer beware that it&#x27;s only 10 oz. instead of what seems to be the standard 13+ oz, but the lotions goes on well, has a pleasant smell and gives a good color fairly quickly. A good bet for the price if you&#x27;re looking to snag some color in a week or so.</li>
    <li> I LOVE masquerade. I have been buying this lotion for 2 years. This lotion helps extend my tan I already have, gives me a rich dark color, and smells like heaven. I have tanned for years and have used too many lotions to count and this lotion is my favorite. I always use masquerade 4 times a week and always stock up on it. It says its supposed to smell like orange musk, but I don&#x27;t like orange scents and I love the smell. It is by far the best smelling lotion I have ever used and I have used many. This lotion leaves my skin protected, smooth, and nourished. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing. It will give you color fast. Best part about it is the smell!! No more leaving the tanning bed with that burnt skin smell.</li>
    <li> This lotion is really good. I usually burn easy, since this is my first time using a tanning bed my friend that works for a tanning salon recommend I use this. And it smells really good too. And it&#x27;s not leaving me dry or to sticky. I will use this lotion again! Also buy the lotion from amazon. I got it half off the price that it was at the salon.</li>
    <li> I Always use this great product,smells good feels good and keeps a tan. great brand for tanning.  Buy Roar if you like tingle</li>
    <li> My favorite tanning lotion. I am sad the price has increased three times the amount it used to be.</li>
    <li> Masquerade is the best!  Great smell, goes on easily without that heavy feeling.  Skin feels soft, produces a great natural looking tan!</li>
    <li> I am more darker now since using this product. Oh it feels so good on your skin and the smell is heavenly!</li>
    <li> This stuff works. Love it.</li>
    <li> Great product thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this about a month and a half ago and waited until the entire bottle was gone to write the review.. I will not be purchasing another bottle though. It is a good lotion, but its not the best. It gives you a nice color and makes you smell nice before and after tanning, but it leaves your skin very greasy and slippery. The very first time I used this it made my hands so greasy and slippery I could not turn the door knob to get out of the tanning room! I tried wiping my hands off on the towel and it did NO help. Luckily I tan in a small locally owned salon and the owner heard me struggling and came to help. If you purchase this i suggest carrying wet-naps with you. But like I said, it was worth the try. I achieved my color and did not turn orange at all.</li>
    <li> First off, I want to say that I&#x27;m reviewing this product as someone who does not tan regularly year-round. I tan before big events, before summer, etc, so I can&#x27;t say how well this product would work on someone that already has a deep, dark base tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotions smells GREAT, and it absorbs well into my skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy, slippery residue like some tanning lotions do. Of course, there&#x27;s some residue as with any lotion you buy, but it&#x27;s less than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the 2nd bottle of this lotion I&#x27;ve purchased. The first one was at the tanning salon, so the other big pro is how much cheaper this is than the salon-price!! I have gotten pretty dark in 5 sessions so far, and the last bottle gave me a nice even tan last year also.</li>
    <li> smells wonderful and works really well with tanning! this is one of my favorites! i got dark fairly quick using this! recommend to anyone that tans!</li>
    <li> love this lotion, nice dark brown tan, not all orange or fake looking, doesnt smell too bad like others, this is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> First used this product as a tester packet and loved the way it smells, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on your body, although it does leave my hands only slightly greasy. Still a great product, I get a great tan with it. This was the first bottle of tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever purchased. half the price here than it is in tanning salons, definitely buy from here!</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly, packaged nicely. It seems to be a fine product and the smell lasts and is quite good.</li>
