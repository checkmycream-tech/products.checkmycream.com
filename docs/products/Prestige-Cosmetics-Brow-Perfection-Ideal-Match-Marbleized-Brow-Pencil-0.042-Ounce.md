<li> This pencil compares well to more expensive ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
<li> When I couldn&#x27;t find it any longer at the usual drugstores,  low and behold, Amazon came through once again!  </li>

<li> My only complaint is that it sometimes gets a little caked up.  </li>
<li> I give it four stars because the color fades after a few hours</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t work well for me :/</li>
<li> I tried a bunch of dark brown eyebrow pencils from other brands but they all had a red undertone to it which I hate.</li>
<li> so it was hard for me to find a color that matched.</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
<li> It&#x27;s no SO bad, but my hair is brown not red-brown.</li>

    <li> Perfect eyebrow pencil.</li>
    <li> It was lighter than expected and it didn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
    <li> Quality for an even better price...can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I like almost everything about this pencil. The consistency is just right, it&#x27;s pigmented just fine, and basically would be perfect. If not for one thing. It&#x27;s got too much red in it. Why oh why do so many brown pencils have this red tone? It&#x27;s no SO bad, but my hair is brown not red-brown. I wish this one cam in a true dark brown.</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing this pencil, the first time I found it at my local drug store. So what I&#x27;m saying is I liked it enough to go online to find another one. This is my go to eye brow pencil, my very fav.</li>
    <li> Matches brows; blends into natural hairs nicely.  My only complaint is that it sometimes gets a little caked up.  Overall, the marbling in the pencil does match better than most other pencils out there.  I would definitely recommend.</li>

    <li> I have used this brow pencil for a number of years.  When I couldn&#x27;t find it any longer at the usual drugstores,  low and behold, Amazon came through once again!

    <li> I have been looking for a good brow pencil as replacement for my current brow for a while (my current one is discontinued) My biggest challenge is finding the color that looks natural and also easy to apply. This eye brow pencil is very easy to apply, and it comes with one end brush gives the natural/soft look ( So I don&#x27;t have to carry additional brush). The best part is the price is amazing and its subscribe&amp; save item so I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of it. I love it!</li>

The brush at the end helps align the hairs of my brow so thats useful. I give it four stars because the color fades after a few hours so I keep it in my purse sometimes for touch ups!</li>

    <li> I have really dark eyebrows, it&#x27;s almost border line black so it was hard for me to find a color that matched. I tried a bunch of dark brown eyebrow pencils from other brands but they all had a red undertone to it which I hate. I finally found the perfect shade for my eyebrows and I love everything about this product.&lt;br /&gt;It blends in really nicely, looks natural on, I love the spoolie attached to the other end. I&#x27;m definitely going to repurchase this when I run out.</li>
