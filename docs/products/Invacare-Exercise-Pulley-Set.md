      <li>I&#x27;m still using my pulley a few times daily to keep my shoulder muscles from becoming stiff and increasing my range of motion.</li>

    <li> Works fine for returning function to my left arm after nerve surgery and the price was very affordable.&lt;br /&gt;would recommend.</li>
    <li> I buy for my wife because she as a frozen shoulder. she stat to use it and she got the result in 10 days she fill good and move hand nicely. And i also use it i feel good ,so good for everybody use it and stay healthy.</li>
    <li> Works great for shoulder range of motion.</li>
    <li> I ordered this one because the smaller pulley set never shipped and I needed it to do my rehab for my surgery and sholder manipulation at home inbetween PT days.  I like the one with only one pulley better... but this works, not big and cumbersome</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because the pulley set was reasonably priced, well constructed, and worked like the one I had used in rehab.</li>
    <li> pulley wheels are plastic -- not metal&lt;br /&gt;easily replaceable from hardware store&lt;br /&gt;bracket and frame well made&lt;br /&gt;okay for the price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m continually amazed at how quickly Amazon gets my orders to me. The over-the-door exercise pulley set is exactly as described and was about half the price of local suppliers, even with shipping. We use it to enhance range of motion and strengthen shoulder muscles. I passed your name along to our physical therapist for her other clients.   Thanks,</li>
    <li> I had rotator cuff surgery last month &amp; this little gadget has been a God send.  My shoulder tends to become stiff from inactivity which in turn causes a lot of pain so I&#x27;ve been sitting in a chair, facing the opposite direction, only using the pulls as far as is safe for my recent surgery but the stretching helps ease the pain &amp; I&#x27;m gaining my mobility back, weightlessly.  I&#x27;d suggest this to anyone with shoulder problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A recent update&lt;br /&gt;Now about 2 mths out from my shoulder surgery, I&#x27;m doing remarkably well and my doctor was astonished at my post op appt with the progress I&#x27;ve made with my shoulder before even beginning any formal physical therapy. I&#x27;m still using my pulley a few times daily to keep my shoulder muscles from becoming stiff and increasing my range of motion. This is definitely one of the very best investments I&#x27;ve made.</li>
    <li> This is a really strong,sturdy piece of equipment. Great for the price! I think that it is made of sturdy steel instead of aluminum.</li>
    <li> Great pulley system for the cost.  This can easily be used in a door and is great for rehab after shoulder surgery.</li>
    <li> Worked perfect for my shoulder recovery</li>
