      <li>good product original</li>
      <li>I guess it is authentic for sex in the city.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this parfum :)</li>
      <li>When i ordered this from amazon it came in busted at the top of the bottle.  </li>
      <li>The box reads \\&quot;Sexy City\\&quot; and is not the \\&quot;Sex and the City\\&quot; brand described in the listing.  </li>
      <li>I gave  this as a gift and the person liked it, I give 3 stars because I did not like it though, smells kinda cheap, but it was worth the money and was a good gift after all.</li>
      <li>its a nice light scent, not overpowering, which is fine.</li>
      <li>It has a low fresh scent that could pass for use during the day and the price is perfect.</li>
      <li>If you want a light scent, order one of the 3.  </li>
      <li>There are cheap perfumes out there that smells really good and the scents are lasting.</li>
      <li>but it is a tad too sweet smelling for my taste.</li>
      <li>I contacted Amazon and let them know, who contacted pretty stuff sales to let them know about their crappy product.</li>
      <li>and I will probably come back for more.</li>
      <li>I ordered exactly what was advertised in the picture for sex in the city &amp;#34;lust&amp;#34; perfume .</li>
      <li>Pretty stuff sales contacted me, asked me to send pictures to confirm.</li>
      <li>I really wanted the Sexy and II in the city perfume, red</li>
      <li>When I received the product the name on it was sexy city &amp;#34;lust&amp;#34; and it was a weaker version of what the actual sex in the city perfume really is.</li>
      <li>i did not get my money back the whole top</li>
      <li>this smells so good at first but the smell only lasts for a few minutes.pretty bottle but do not waste your money</li>
      <li>I have many expensive scents and a knockoff is easy to spot...</li>
      <li>I like the soft smell of freshness.</li>

    <li> I have all 3 \\&quot;Sex in the City\\&quot; Parfum Sprays. If you want a light scent, order one of the 3.  The Parfum is not all day fragrance but for the night out or guests for dinner; perfect parfum spray.</li>
    <li> I had a few problems with the bottle spray, but found I had to push down really hard...its a nice light scent, not overpowering, which is fine. I don&#x27;t think this is a knockoff...I have many expensive scents and a knockoff is easy to spot...I have the nose of a beagle!</li>
    <li> I get asked what I&#x27;m wearing everytime I wear it but it is a tad too sweet smelling for my taste. With name like Lust I expected a spicy, sensual scent.</li>
    <li> actually love this product its smells wonderful. When i ordered this from amazon it came in busted at the top of the bottle.  Perfume leaked all over the bottle, packaging and lost about 1/3 of the perfume in the bottle. This was suppose to be a christmas present, but as it came in broken did not give to my friend. I contacted Amazon and let them know, who contacted pretty stuff sales to let them know about their crappy product. Pretty stuff sales contacted me, asked me to send pictures to confirm. I did this and i have never heard from them again. Will not be ordereing from this company ever again they are the biggest rip off.   If you order this product, you will be throwing your money away!!!</li>
    <li> I really wanted the Sexy and II in the city perfume, red</li>
    <li> This product came in a timely manner. It has a low fresh scent that could pass for use during the day and the price is perfect. I would recommend this parfum :)</li>
    <li> me muero por este perfume. es rico. y el envase es muy lindo y grande. economico. buen producto para comprar. llego en perfectas condiciones.</li>
    <li> this product is good I made a mistake and got 2 of the same. but I like it a lot so no complaints.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Bought 3 and its a knock off I should have read the reviews before I paid. I ended up giving all 3 away.</li>
    <li> I ordered exactly what was advertised in the picture for sex in the city &amp;#34;lust&amp;#34; perfume . When I received the product the name on it was sexy city &amp;#34;lust&amp;#34; and it was a weaker version of what the actual sex in the city perfume really is.</li>
    <li> it don&#x27;t last very long but I will be purchasing another sex and the city perfume shortly different scent overall I like it.</li>
    <li> This is the worst ever. Do not buy. There are cheap perfumes out there that smells really good and the scents are lasting. But then again what  would you expect for something that price. I would not recommend it at all</li>
    <li> I like the soft smell of freshness. Great product for it&#x27;s price. I would recommend anyone to buy it and I will probably come back for more.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume ever ! im almost out again and am so happy I can find it on amazon. Life saver ! smells great definitely worth the buy! So happy with the purchase !</li>
    <li> good product original</li>
    <li> I guess it is authentic for sex in the city. Whatever that means. This is a knock off of Sex AND the city and it is a pretty horrible one at that.</li>
    <li> these were bogus fakes, the smell does not even last for ten minutes, do not buy you will regret it!</li>
    <li> this smells so good at first but the smell only lasts for a few minutes.pretty bottle but do not waste your money</li>
    <li> The box reads \\&quot;Sexy City\\&quot; and is not the \\&quot;Sex and the City\\&quot; brand described in the listing.  False advertising.</li>
    <li> I gave  this as a gift and the person liked it, I give 3 stars because I did not like it though, smells kinda cheap, but it was worth the money and was a good gift after all.</li>
    <li> I use to wear this Its has a nice smell glad for Amazon</li>
    <li> this perfum smell good but it is horrible my bottle was broken and it is false its not the real sex and the city i did not get my money back the whole top was broken off it looked used in plus it was leaking when it arivved not good product</li>
