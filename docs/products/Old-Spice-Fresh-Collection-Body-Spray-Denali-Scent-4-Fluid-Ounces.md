      <li>I have tried every CVS store and they do not carry this scent any more why???&lt;br</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s chemistry, or more magic.  </li>
      <li>Love the scent.</li>
      <li>I love the scent</li>
      <li>This is my favorite way for my boyfriend to smell.</li>

      <li>Nice clean smell for the the price.</li>
      <li>I like the Old Spice body sprays, they all smell great and because of the savings</li>
      <li>Fantastic investment :)</li>
      <li>but through Amazon my Grandsons can enjoy the use of a product they like</li>
      <li>Smells great going on, but the scent doesn&#x27;t even seem to last 10 minutes.  </li>
      <li>and I was excited to use this as a substitute for my cologne.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, my dad used Old Spice some 35-40 yrs ago and as the trends have come full circle, my children will get to experience something I miss about him ;)</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon !!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s essentially a deodorant with a nice smell.</li>
      <li>It looks to me that I will have to continue spending more on Axe until Old Spice redesigns these bottles.  </li>
      <li>Old spice make another body spray or even cologne with the Denali name with the same pleasant smell and I&#x27;ll buy.</li>
      <li>For the price it&#x27;s not bad but don&#x27;t set your expectations high as I did.</li>
      <li>the packaging was safe and left no dents in any of the cans.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not usually into body sprays, but I really love the Old Spice Denali scent, so decided to give it a try.  </li>
      <li>would recommend highly if you like fresh smells</li>
      <li>he loved it so much that he asked me to get him the same things as a Christmas present when I visit him in Italy ...</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a clean fresh scent that last all day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The fragrance is ok nothing special but it just doesn&#x27;t last as long as the Axe body spray.  </li>
      <li>and I really think I just got a defective batch.  </li>
      <li>it really works</li>
      <li>Wish this was available locally.</li>
      <li>but, it isn&#x27;t available locally any longer.</li>
      <li>I usually buy Axe body spray but decided to give Old Spice body spray a try and they are average at best.  </li>
      <li>and I do find more comes out with less exertion</li>
      <li>As mentioned in the title, I love the small of these Old Spice fresh collection body sprays.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought this because I use this same Old spice scent for my deodorant and body wash</li>
      <li>I bought three and haven&#x27;t used them at all due to the scent being too strong and not being the Denali scent.</li>
      <li>Stick with the real Old Spice.</li>
      <li>My husband loves this scent and has been having difficulty finding it in our normal stores.</li>
      <li>It is not available in most stores now</li>
      <li>Now the stockings for my boys are complete</li>
      <li>I like it so much that when I could not find it locally any longer I looked for an alternative place to purchase it.  </li>
      <li>But I surprised him with the three pack</li>
      <li>The stores stopped carrying it near me, so I bought the three pack.</li>
      <li>I continue to use Old Spice body sprays</li>
      <li>I have tried turning the whole upper casing to different degrees</li>
      <li>In the off position, it prevents accidental spray, but in the on position, you have to really push down on the nozzle to get anything to come out.  </li>

<li> Other than that, if you want something to just spray on before work if you&#x27;re a blue collar guy or leaving the gym etc</li>
<li> but this is one of the few scents I actually like.</li>
<li> Denali is about the only Old Spice scent that doesn&#x27;t smell fake or manufactured.</li>
<li> The longevity is weak, but the scent sticks around long enough in the bathroom for me to get whatever done and then get the hell out (before I start gagging).</li>
<li> hard to say, it is sort of mysterious..</li>
<li> I find that very curious!</li>
<li> I have dealt with Amazon a few years</li>
<li> , however it&#x27;s still not smooth.  </li>
<li> Waste of money, in my opinion.</li>
<li> Not sure how to describe it,</li>
<li> Probably because it is very heavy on the alcohol content.</li>
<li> This is a poor imitation.</li>
<li> Why would they make it so difficult to use?  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, they&#x27;ve started to limit production of it.</li>
<li> I was wrong.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just a regular body spray that smells nasty.</li>
<li> was unable to find this scent anywhere.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, the spray nozzle is very poorly designed.  </li>

    <li> I usually buy Axe body spray but decided to give Old Spice body spray a try and they are average at best.  The fragrance is ok nothing special but it just doesn&#x27;t last as long as the Axe body spray.  If you spray it on after a shower in the morning by mid-day the fragrance is gone unlike Axe which last all day.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice clean smell for the the price. Pairs well with cocoa butter lotions or any nut or wood scent. Wish this was available locally.</li>
    <li> Love the scent. Bought it for my boyfriend as one of his Birthday presents. He usually buys it in store, but it seems like Walmart and Target stopped selling this particular scent, so he moved on to Wolfthorn or whatever. But I surprised him with the three pack and he loved it! I&#x27;m not a fan of men&#x27;s cologne etc. but this is one of the few scents I actually like.</li>
    <li> As mentioned in the title, I love the small of these Old Spice fresh collection body sprays.  They work and smell just as good as axe products with a cheaper pricetag.  Only difference is they  don&#x27;t seem to last as long.  Other than that, if you want something to just spray on before work if you&#x27;re a blue collar guy or leaving the gym etc I&#x27;d go with this product.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this because I use this same Old spice scent for my deodorant and body wash and I couldn&#x27;t believe they made a body spray out of it. I love the scent and I was excited to use this as a substitute for my cologne. I was wrong. This scent carries the Denali name but does not carry the same scent as the body wash and deodorant of the same name. The scent is a very strong scent and not in a good way. I wish it smelled like the rest of the Denali line. For the price it&#x27;s not bad but don&#x27;t set your expectations high as I did. It&#x27;s just a regular body spray that smells nasty. I bought three and haven&#x27;t used them at all due to the scent being too strong and not being the Denali scent. It should be called something else. Old spice make another body spray or even cologne with the Denali name with the same pleasant smell and I&#x27;ll buy. Don&#x27;t buy this</li>
    <li> Wish my local stores still carried the product! It&#x27;s the only body spray that doesn&#x27;t leave an odd odor 8-12 hrs later. Surprisingly, my dad used Old Spice some 35-40 yrs ago and as the trends have come full circle, my children will get to experience something I miss about him ;)</li>
    <li> Very very happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I was unable to find this scent anywhere.  Now the stockings for my boys are complete</li>
    <li> This is an amazing scent. I have tried every CVS store and they do not carry this scent any more why???&lt;br /&gt;It is a clean fresh scent that last all day.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to give it TEN STARS !!!!&lt;br /&gt;If you have never tried it get it from Amaazon.&lt;br /&gt;I bought six cans from Amazon and they can within a week.&lt;br /&gt;Old Spice you got a winner.</li>
    <li> Thought I was buying a product that had a lasting scent. It does not. Probably because it is very heavy on the alcohol content. Stick with the real Old Spice. This is a poor imitation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find this stuff everywhere and I finally found it! Now I&#x27;m set for a good, long time. :D</li>
    <li> I got the Denali deodorant and the Body Wash for a friend when he was visiting me from Italy. he loved it so much that he asked me to get him the same things as a Christmas present when I visit him in Italy ...</li>
    <li> Not sure how to describe it, but it&#x27;s essentially a deodorant with a nice smell. I like it but will try something else in my next purchase</li>
    <li> I have used it for years but, it isn&#x27;t available locally any longer. I have dealt with Amazon a few years&lt;br /&gt;and thought you might carry it. I&#x27;m really glad that you do. I am still able to buy the Danali Body Wash&lt;br /&gt;locally but not the Body Spray. I find that very curious!</li>
    <li> this item is a favorite with my Grandsons.  It is not available in most stores now but through Amazon my Grandsons can enjoy the use of a product they like</li>
    <li> i love this smell! i got it for my boyfriend. we checked every walmart and target and couldn&#x27;t the denali spray. so happy we found it here</li>
    <li> This is my favorite way for my boyfriend to smell. The stores stopped carrying it near me, so I bought the three pack. Fantastic investment :)</li>
    <li> Mild and pleasant smell. Lasts longer on your body and is a good buy. Have been asked by some of the strangers of what deo was i using.</li>
    <li> awesome scent had to order online as everyone seems to be out of it.  would recommend highly if you like fresh smells</li>
    <li> The longevity is weak, but the scent sticks around long enough in the bathroom for me to get whatever done and then get the hell out (before I start gagging).</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen the spray in years but lo&#x27;and behold Amazon has it works great and the packaging was safe and left no dents in any of the cans.</li>
    <li> great value, great product</li>
    <li> My husband loves this scent and has been having difficulty finding it in our normal stores. Amazon has the BEST deal on this item. We are SO happy with this purchase! Hubby can smell yummy, for a great price, delivered to our door! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Denali is about the only Old Spice scent that doesn&#x27;t smell fake or manufactured. Unfortunately, they&#x27;ve started to limit production of it. It was my go-to daily body spray, though.</li>
    <li> I like the Old Spice body sprays, they all smell great and because of the savings, I thought this would be a good alternative to Axe sprays.  Unfortunately, the spray nozzle is very poorly designed.  In the off position, it prevents accidental spray, but in the on position, you have to really push down on the nozzle to get anything to come out.  I have tried turning the whole upper casing to different degrees and I do find more comes out with less exertion, however it&#x27;s still not smooth.  I feel like I need to be working out in the gym to use it.  Why would they make it so difficult to use?  It looks to me that I will have to continue spending more on Axe until Old Spice redesigns these bottles.  I had signed up for Subscribe &amp; Save for even better deals, but I had to cancel that too.    UPDATE:  I continue to use Old Spice body sprays and I really think I just got a defective batch.  All subsequent cans have operated with ease.  As a result, I have re-evaluated my rating, bumping it up from a 2 star to 4 star.</li>
    <li> I love this body spray!  I like it so much that when I could not find it locally any longer I looked for an alternative place to purchase it.  Thanks Amazon !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually into body sprays, but I really love the Old Spice Denali scent, so decided to give it a try.  Smells great going on, but the scent doesn&#x27;t even seem to last 10 minutes.  Waste of money, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> it is charming or is it mesmerizing? hard to say, it is sort of mysterious.. in a way. i don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s chemistry, or more magic.  like babe magnetics. it really works</li>
    <li> Wonderful Product; I look for the best deals when making my purchases; And Old Spice has expanded with body washes, deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;body sprays; I am sure you will be impressed with this product:</li>
