      <li>It&#x27;s one of the better options out there.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s better than the sticky mascara type concealers.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to keep using it, maybe I&#x27;ll apply more product.</li>
      <li>Oddly, I love it for my eyebrows.  </li>

      <li>I had one spot on the top of my head that was coming in slower than the rest.</li>
      <li>I would love for JRivers to produce something like that.  </li>
      <li>I think I like the spray-ons better.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very nice product.  Works as described.  Took one use to get the hang of how to apply, but overall was easy to use.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t leave the house without it.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair and bought this hoping that it will work for my stray grays or fill in the grays between coloring.  Well, it does NOT work at all for me.  Oddly, I love it for my eyebrows.  I use very little of it and the color is natural and it stays well on my eyebrows.  Of course I use my own eyebrow brush.  The brush it comes with is not very good as the bristles are always coming off.  I&#x27;ve had it for months now and it is still falling off anytime you try to use it.</li>
    <li> its the best in the market!</li>
    <li> A product I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair, and I&#x27;m grateful for this product.  It is much better than any other hair fill-in powder on the market.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, really covers up all my thinning areas.</li>
    <li> It works quite well in covering gray and lessening the appearance of thinning areas.  I also found Cover Your Gray with Procapil (comes in many colors) work just as well for 1/3 the cost.  I discovered Cover Your Gray at a local supermarket.  It lasts a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;When using either of these products, less is best.  Apply a little bit at a time.</li>
    <li> I really like This fill powder.  It makes you look so much younger when you fill in that part and/or thinning spots.  It also does an amazing job temporarily covering the gray; in between coloring.  I get at least a extra week and a half between.  I love that. Thanks for offering this great product.</li>
    <li> It was like eyeshadow.  It did darken the scalp where hair was thin.  It was a bit hard to apply, I had to go over the same area several times, however, when you are experiencing hair loss you will not mind.</li>
    <li> Have used product before. Love it great for covering thin spot on the crown.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful -- blends easily and really does what it says.  You will be pleased with your purchase.</li>
    <li> Joan Ver Heul here.  I&#x27;ve used this product for around 2 years.  I like it very much.  It covers the thin spots in your hair good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many types of grey cover-ups.  Have been using this for last 2 years, this is the only one that works.. it&#x27;s easy, clean and fast to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Finally NO grey between colors.  love it!</li>
    <li> Gifted to my grandma, and she loved it. Said it works well and blends smoothly that no one can notice any difference. She carries it in her purse whether she goes. She looks great and is very happy. A +++</li>
    <li> The powder was everywhere, huge mess.  It looked like it was very old, and had been sitting on a shelf forever.  Then before shipping it out they kicked it around a few times.  It was a disappointment.  I think it would&#x27;ve been great if it only arrived in one piece.</li>
    <li> works good for people who have thinning hair (me) or cancer patients.  I&#x27;ve told several friends who are very interested.</li>
    <li> i gave this a five star because it is the best. the color match perfect in between coloring an my thining hair</li>
    <li> Always works great but a little expensive</li>
    <li> It works for those of you with roots showing but I am letting my hair grow out and the area to cover is now too large.  I use it to fill in my eyebrows and use a smaller brush.  I wish I had known about it years ago.  The brunette color is actually a soft black.&lt;br /&gt;It has an odd smell to it and usually I am not bothered so this is my very first complaint about scent.  FYI, demi hair color does not wash out.</li>
    <li> The color of this is too dark, and I actually have fairly dark hair (except for the gray!)  I also hadn&#x27;t tried a powder/brush-type of cover before. I think I like the spray-ons better.  They don&#x27;t color the skin as much, especially if you don&#x27;t spray too much in one spot.</li>
    <li> I was suffering from hair loss due to some medical issues and was on the verge of buying a wig.  As a last resort, I decided to try this, though I was skeptical.  Thank goodness I did!  It really camouflaged the thinning spots and was unnoticeable on my scalp.  Initially, I was worried that I had ordered the wrong color, after reading many customer reviews.  I have medium/dark brown hair, and I ordered brunette, which did appear to be a little on the black side.  But I almost think it is better to have it a little darker, since it blended in well with the color of my hair.  It is even undetectable in natural sunlight.  Amazing product!  I wish I could give it more than five stars!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and tried a few others. This is by far the best! It&#x27;s especially good around the hairline and part. I have thinning hair and also grey. I use it in conjunction with Toppik for all over coverage. Great on eyebrows too! Not messy either.</li>
    <li> Talk about a great product! Thank you Joan Rivers!!!!! My hair is thinning, but with Joan Rivers Great Hair Day it looks like I have a full head of hair! Love this product!</li>
    <li> The service was great, delivery timely, but the product is not as good as I expected a Joan Rivers product to be.  I received brunette, which is actually black, goes on with difficulty and black powder spreads with combing, arranging hair, and falls on forehead.  I did not bring the powder all the way down to the hairline, as instructed, but it spread and smeared.  I was disappointed.  I have used another product which did not rub off, did not migrate and flake.  I would love for JRivers to produce something like that.  Sorry!</li>
    <li> The color options are limited.  There&#x27;s a strong perfume scent to the powder.  The powder is very loose; after applying, it easily falls off when brushing or even touching your hair.  The coverage is adequate, but does not stay on as well as other products.  As an alternative to some other products, such as Dermatch, it is adequate.</li>
    <li> I colour my hair so when my hair starts growing out, my little side burns seem quite noticeably gray so it&#x27;s nice to be able to hide it with the Brunette coloured Great Hair Day...plus it&#x27;s great for little areas where your hair might separate in the back on your crown area...covers up the white skin...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent price from this company and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Hard to put on, especially around the hairline.  It doesn&#x27;t really cover the grey that well. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The color is more of a dark grey than a brown.  Should have ordered the blonde.  A true brunette color would be nice.</li>
    <li> I do like it, it blends well, but I find it doesn&#x27;t cover the gray hair as much as it covers the scalp. Maybe that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s suppose to do, but I wouldn&#x27;t think so... what would be the purpose of using it. I&#x27;m going to keep using it, maybe I&#x27;ll apply more product. It certainly beats the spray on cans between color.</li>
    <li> Love, what a miracle. Really boosted my self confidence.</li>
    <li> Simply the best. My only criticism is it&#x27;s priced too high - give working class women who selflessly support big families a chance to look nice too please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But beyond the inflated price tag, here&#x27;s what you need to know: No other product does what this does. It&#x27;s great for both camouflaging thinning areas where scalp peeks through, and as well, it works to hide your roots when you&#x27;re running late on your dye schedule. Even covers grays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joan was an awesome person, and she put her name on this because it&#x27;s a great product. Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> i was beginning to see a little too much scalp around the part line. i heard about this product but was not sure how i would like it. it works! fills in perfectly &amp; only i know it&#x27;s there. my only problem was that the brunette is really, really dark. my hair is a medium brown with a bit of red so i ordered the red. i mix the two &amp; it&#x27;s a good match. also spray some hairspray afterwards to really set the powder in place.</li>
    <li> Great product joann u change my life wish u where still withus godbless her</li>
    <li> My wife told it works fine, shes happy with it</li>
    <li> LIFE SAVER I was always so self conscious about my thinnin hair a d alway had to wear my hair in a clip or pulled up.  I have the brunette powder and omg seriously works like magic.  Some time when I see women wit thinning hair j wanna tell them about this but I feel like it would be rude lol but leme tell u I wish I found this year&#x27;s ago</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t find a better product to disguise thinning hair. It is amazing. I have been using it for years. I have painfully thin hair. I perm it and use this product and I think I am the only one who knows just how thin my hair is! This product has really changed my life and given me confidence to go out the door!</li>
    <li> Works good.  Gives the illusion of thicker hair doesn&#x27;t rub off on your clothes but stays in place before washing your hair.  It&#x27;s one of the better options out there. I don&#x27;t like Joan Rivers though she&#x27;s sort of arrogant.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years, and it really makes a difference on how thin my hair appears. Some drawbacks are: 1) it takes awhile to put on for the kind of coverage I need.  My hair is very thin, and I have to put on several&amp;#34;coats&amp;#34; 2) the powder gets on other things while you are applying it.  I can&#x27;t use Rogaine because it breaks me out and this the best product I have found for hiding scalp-which improves the look of thin hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It doesn&#x27;t flake or drip and it comes off when you wash your hair. I use it all the time to hide the grays on the side and on the top hairline. Don&#x27;t color my hair as often as I used to. I have black hair and the brunette color works great for me. The reason for the 4 rating is that the tip of the brush keeps coming off. Otherwise this is great product which I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Doesn&#x27;t run or smear. A little messy when applying. Stays until you wash your hair. Love this product! Don&#x27;t know what I would do without it!</li>
    <li> Great Product , even it its more pricey than the other similar products in the market, it&#x27;s worth paying more! in the end you get more value for what you pay.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! It does what it says it will do and more!!!</li>
    <li> Works just like Joan said it would, love the case and brush. I had another product but it would not color the scalp like Joan&#x27;s product does. Glad I bought this, have the need to Cover your roots, by this one you won&#x27;t be sorry. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Oh, Joan Joan Joan, how I miss you. I still think of you every time I use this product. GREAT for covering thin spots, it does not look at all painted on and really does last until you shampoo it out. It even works for minor root touchup, while you&#x27;re at it. Leave it to Joan Rivers to find the right product to make an aging woman look and feel a lot better. Rest well, gorgeous.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and great product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT,,, I LOVE  THAT THIS PRODUCT ACTUALLY COVERS , AND MY HAIR  DOES&#x27;NT LOOK THIN. WOULD DEFINITELY WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. LOVE, LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I have tried other products but nothing covers as much as the Great hair powder .  It helps from dying my hair as much too.</li>
    <li> This made my hair feel gross! Some people rave about it. I hate it. Trying to get rid of it. Ugh.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this ! I absolutely can&#x27;t live without this. It hides my thinning hair . Awesome product and people think I have thick hair now !!</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different types of hair filler powder, this is the only one that goes on smooth and easy, and doesnt rub off once its on your scape.  Easy to apply, I use the brunette and it is a great color match.  If you like pony tails but hate seeing white scalp or just want fuller/thicker looking hair this stuff works amazing!</li>
    <li> Great fill in for the hairline.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have very fine thin hair and it fills in all the bald spots.  You can&#x27;t even tell. Looks like I have a full head of hair.  Been using this for about 2 years. Can&#x27;t do without it I get the brunette.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Bought it for my son. He had hair loss due to milk and food allergies! He sweats and works out and there are no accidents of it running. Works like a charm! Have bought it several times. Uses it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;RIP Joan Rivers! Prayers for Melissa and Cooper.</li>
    <li> This product covers well and doesn&#x27;t come off easily the way spray-on products do.  I find it&#x27;s faster to apply it with a round, cotton, lint-free pad.  Be sure to apply it directly to your scalp and not the actual hair.</li>
    <li> Works so well with my fine hair! I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wife SWEARS by this stuff. I can&#x27;t say too much, but she uses it between the salon visits. Could save millions in hair color over your life. Instead of going every month, switch to every other month, save money and your sanity.</li>
    <li> This works great for anyone with thinning hair. I used this every day and like that it stays put. I only comes off when you shampoo your hair. It gives my hair a much fuller look than anything else I have tried and still looks natural. The blonde works for anyone with light to med. brown hair. I have recently dyed my hair a darker brown and went to the brunette. It&#x27;s very dark but still looks natural. I have used this for a couple of years now and don&#x27;t see changing to anything else unless someone invents a way to grow more hair !</li>
    <li> My hair fell out when I was 19, it became very thin and fine.  Later, we found that I had hypothyroidism, but starting Synthroid didn&#x27;t help my hair loss.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from Rogaine to Nioxin to grow it back.  For the past few years, I&#x27;ve been able to hide my hair loss with hair thickening products and some clever styling.  However, after having gastric bypass surgery, I lost more hair than I expected.  I went crazy trying to find a wig that would look natural, but wearing a wig in the summer (in Kentucky) is SO uncomfortable.  I found this product advertised in a magazine and ordered it from a different website that was selling it for a few dollars less.  I can&#x27;t believe the difference it makes!  I was afraid it would look like I rubbed shoe polish on my scalp, but it doesn&#x27;t!  It fills in the bare spots and makes my hair appear thicker.  I wish I had found this product years ago!  So, I&#x27;m able to put off using those wigs for a while longer.  The product doesn&#x27;t come off--it stays where you put it.  It doesn&#x27;t mark up my pillowcase, either.  It does come off on your fingers if you rub your scalp, but it washes off and out of your hair with shampoo.  This stuff really does make you have a &amp;#34;great hair day.&amp;#34;  Very pleased and relieved!</li>
    <li> My wife is thrilled with this product.  She has medium-brown hair, and uses both the brunette and blonde fill-in powders to cover thin spots and &amp;#34;widening part&amp;#34; issues.  The powder stays on her scalp, doesn&#x27;t come off on pillows and gives her hair the illusion of depth and volume.  She uses the brunette powder for the crown of her head, and she uses the blonde fill-in powder for areas closer to her hairline.</li>
    <li> I love it ! It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years and can&#x27;t live with out it unless I grow some hairs on my scalp. Is there anything for that?</li>
    <li> I have never written a product review before. I have been using this product in Brunette for several years. I was very self-conscious of my scalp showing through my dyed dark brown hair (my hair is naturally almost 100% gray). I am in my late-forties and hormonal changes and genetics have caused my hair to become very thin in the crown area.The brush is small enough for detail, but large enough to cover thin spots completely. The color is undetectable and will not fade or come out until you wash your hair. I hope this product is never discontinued. It increases my confidence as a woman with thinning hair, has no odor (a different product I tried smelled so strong it gave me a headache), and is very natural looking. Before you try pills, vitamins, chemicals like Rogaine (which can effect your heart), or an expensive wig, try this.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT.  NOTHING IS LIKE HAVING YOUR OWN FULL HEAD OF HAIR BUT THE COLOR STAYS ON YOUR HEAD.  (YES, IF YOU SCRATCH YOUR SCALP, YOU WILL SEE SOMETHING ON YOUR FINGERNAIL) BUT IT WON&#x27;T BE ON YOUR PILLOW.  I GAVE IT FOUR STARS BECAUSE THE BROWN IS EXTREMELY DARK, ALMOST BLACK AND I HAVE VERY DARK HAIR AND IT&#x27;S STILL TOO DARK.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Very happy with this purchase.  It&#x27;s everything the other happy reviewers said it is.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t be without it, as an over 80 yr old with thinning hair it covers the scalp very nicely.</li>
    <li> All I can say is:  Simply  Marvelous!</li>
    <li> Ive ordered cheaper priced powders and NOT ONE has the coverage like this one.  I can confidently apply this and it blends well with my dark brown hair.  Other brands look ashy!  No more cutting corners and buying the cheaper brands, they&#x27;re just  waste of money!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care much for this product.  the color was right, but it didn&#x27;t go on easily and made a mess. also it&#x27;s difficult to use near the hairline-- it spills on to the forehead and it&#x27;s difficult to clean up.</li>
    <li> Upon using this product I was amazed by the difference it made, my hair no longer looked thin!! Buy it, it works!!</li>
    <li> Really works. Great product.</li>
    <li> This product works like a charm!  Do not hesitate to buy it!!</li>
    <li> Sometimes it will work well and sometimes it will not adhere to my scalp and will come out patchy.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried to fix this by using something sticky like hairspray or mousse or leaving it slightly damp.&lt;br /&gt;Even if my hair is clean and dry or any of the above I still have issues with it being  patchy,&lt;br /&gt;I wind up using more of this product  to cover up and its still too dark for brunette hair&lt;br /&gt;(sometimes it comes out looking like black coffee grounds).&lt;br /&gt;On my  last order I received the application brush and it fell apart on me within a week.&lt;br /&gt;I think I am going to have to start looking into other products.</li>
    <li> the best powder for the hair! Lets me extend getting color by an additional week. Also use it on my eyebrows to fill in. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> love it&#x27;s high quality. I am a repeating customer to this product.</li>
    <li> The brown color works great.  This last and lasts in the hairline until you wash it out.  It is worth the price!</li>
    <li> this stuff works so great.  I was told by a dr that I have female pattern alopecia so I have very thin hair. It&#x27;s embarrassing. People will stare at my baldness so I brush this stuff on and it looks like I&#x27;ve got hair.  I have confidence to go out with it brushed on my head.  I recommend it very highly.  I hope they never stop selling it.</li>
    <li> The product is expensive for the size of the compact. It also leaves residue on my pillow. The brunette color is very dark, almost black.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!!!! It has really made my hairstyle so much better. It&#x27;s also boost my confidence level about my hair. Thank you Joan Rivers! Rest in Peace.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this to cover gray, just to fill in thinning areas of my scalp.  Works great, camouflages your scalp so the thinning is much less noticeable. My husband uses it for his patches and it looks pretty good..best tip I read was use a cotton ball instead of a brush. Much, much faster!</li>
    <li> I head really, really good things about this before buying this. It absolutely lived up to the reviews!</li>
    <li> Fills in thinning spots amazingly and stays until next hair wash! I highly recommend this product, my hair looks so much thicker!</li>
    <li> Great, wonderful makes my hair look thicker &amp; fuller. I always receive compliments how nice my hair looks.</li>
    <li> Joan Rivers came up with a great product that is easy to use.  Helps get you to the next time you color your hair by covering the gray or to fill in where hair is thin.</li>
    <li> The area I have to cover is pretty large. I have bald spots. Dark brown hair. I ordered the brunette and it&#x27;s too dark. I haven&#x27;t had luck with any kind of powder or the fiber kind. So I&#x27;ve given up on powder for my head. Really wanted this to work.</li>
    <li> Love it. I am a cosmetologist and use this product often on several customers.</li>
    <li> Brush is substandard.  The strands are coming apart.  Powder does not seem like pressed powder.  As brush is stroked upon the surface, too much powder comes loose.  So much that the excess falls onto the counter.  My sister purchased this product elsewhere, yet she does not have the same issues. . .although she does not like the brush either.</li>
    <li> Just as expected! Love this product!!</li>
    <li> Great product! I have a good head of hair, so I don&#x27;t need a filler, but I do use it to cover the gray between permanent color application. It does a fine job and unless someone is standing right over the top of you it&#x27;s not really noticeable.</li>
    <li> This product lets me stretch my hair color appointments further apart. Goes on nicely and does not come off until you shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have used it once to cover up some of the grey until my hair grows out instead of using the dyes. It seems to work. Hard to do by yourself.</li>
    <li> Just started using this for thinning hair because of hair dye that was left on too long.  The thinning seems to be worse at my hairline and in my bangs. Was giving me anxiety attacks.  After applying this, looking in the mirror made me feel much better.  Looked as if I still had my full bangs instead of these thinning ones I have now.  If I put it on and it goes on too dark, I just keep working the brush and it blends in just right.</li>
    <li> This product really works very well.  It&#x27;s a powder so it&#x27;s better than the sticky mascara type concealers.  I think the coverage is adequate enough.  I use it cover the gray, not on my scalp.  I am pleased with it and would use it again.</li>
    <li> Love this! I have alopecia and I needed something to cover certain areas with less hair, it worked wonders. Looked like I had a full head of hair.</li>
    <li> Better than others, but not perfect.  Something about my scalp - I shampoo everyday so my scalp is not oily but it doesn&#x27;t want to stick.  I bought it at the recommendation of someone who uses the gray (I bought the brunette) and she love it and it sticks for her.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s me or if it&#x27;s the difference color formulations.  It&#x27;s better than the fiber ones I tried.</li>
    <li> Works really well but don&#x27;t put to much because it will flake off. It is to be used in spots your hair is thinning not to cover grey hair</li>
    <li> Really helps fill in the gaps. Rember to wash hair befor bed or powder will appear on your pillowcase.</li>
    <li> This is simply amazing. My hairdresser calls it my miracle powder.  I never want to be without it.</li>
    <li> this was the quickest I received my package.  Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this joan rivers great hair day for years...CAN&#x27;T LIVE WITHOUT IT.</li>
    <li> Good coverage but leaves the hair dirty after a few days.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair because of chemo treatments, but enough that I do not have to wear a wig.  I was hoping this product would work better than the shake on type that I am currently using, since it has a brush and can pinpoint exactly where I want to apply it.  However, it does not cover as well as I thought it would, and as previous customers have mentioned, the brush started losing it&#x27;s fibers after the very first use.  I believe there are other products out there that will work much better.  If you&#x27;re looking to use it just on the part of your hair to cover up just your roots, it may be worth a try.</li>
    <li> This product was just what I needed. My hair is just coming back after having chemotherapy.I had one spot on the top of my head that was coming in slower than the rest. It is subtle…a friend remarked that my hair was finally growing nicely in that spot, and was shocked when I told her it was a fake out! I don&#x27;t use the brush it comes with..too small. I use a large make up brush to cover a 2x3inch area.I have dark brown hair, this matched perfectly. I now have confidence to go out without a hat or scarf.</li>
    <li> The Fill-in-Power, worked great. I have two crowns, one on each side. My hair has thin out a lot since I turned 60,especially around my crowns. (luckey me)&lt;br /&gt;Its as close to a miracle as it gets....Very happy with the way it goes on it looks like I have fuller hair... No one will ever know.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of Joan Rivers Great Hair Day Fill-in Powder and I am very pleased with the results.  I received my purchase within two days and have no complaints.</li>
