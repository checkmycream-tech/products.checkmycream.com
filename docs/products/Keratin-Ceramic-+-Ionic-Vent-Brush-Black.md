      <li>I wish they would send me a new one , because $30 for a brush is a lot for it not too last .</li>
      <li>By using it, the brush will separates your hair in a way that your hair seems thicker, and it will dry much quicker because your hair is not clumping together.</li>
      <li>Although not as transporting ions to my hair for less frizz as I hoped (like my $6 ion comb), it is an excellent vent brush to de-tangle my thick, wavy hair when it is wet or dry with less breaking.</li>

<li> no thanks to Sleekhair.  </li>
<li> Well, if they had given that disclaimer up front, I would have never taken a chance and spent 34 dollars on a product that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
<li> They are difficult to find and this was also much less in price.</li>
<li> There is a less expensive one on Amazon also</li>
<li> I received this item broken.</li>
<li> but this brush does NOT do what it claims and is very difficult to work with if you are trying to blow-dry and style your hair.</li>

    <li> Love this brush - best I&#x27;ve ever had.  Works great on my keratin treated hair...comes out soft and straight.  Not heave and easy to hsndle</li>
    <li> I love the brush ! It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve had in a long time , it doesn&#x27;t pull or tangle my very long hair . But about a year after I bought it I dropped it on my bathroom tile floor while brushing my wet hair  and the head of the brush cracked in two pieces . I&#x27;ve never had a brush crack in 1/2 before !  I wish they would send me a new one , because $30 for a brush is a lot for it not too last .</li>
    <li> I received this item broken. It had to be returned.</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing this brush (the first was broken in my checked luggage on a flight - not the fault of the manufacturer!), and I highly recommend it!  Seems to smooth my wavy hair better than any brush I have tried.  I was put off at first by its large size, but after using it I am hooked.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for years and although I&#x27;ve bought 2 replacements I would not use anything else.  I love it on my curly hair that I straighten every time I brush my hair. Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> This brush eliminates the tangles.  Sooo awesome!!!</li>
    <li> I saw this product in a magazine and thought it would do a good job of drying my hair but was a bit hesitant to spend the money for a plastic brush.  It did not dry my hair as smoothly as the cheap round brush I was using before.  When I sent an email asking for a return authorization code, I was promptly informed that Sleekhair could not take a return on a hair care product for reasons of sanitation.  Well, if they had given that disclaimer up front, I would have never taken a chance and spent 34 dollars on a product that didn&#x27;t work.  Luckily, Amazon customer service rocks my world and they are crediting my account0 no thanks to Sleekhair.  I don&#x27;t know who is giving them these five star reviews but this brush does NOT do what it claims and is very difficult to work with if you are trying to blow-dry and style your hair.</li>
    <li> Best flat brush I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It&#x27;s so big that it feels great and seems to work better than the smaller brushes I&#x27;ve owned in the past. it&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> met expectations by my mom</li>
    <li> This brush is like a massage to me. I purchased one from my hair stylist and loved it until i dropped it on a stone floor and it broke. They are difficult to find and this was also much less in price. It feels very nice to brush your hair with this brush.</li>
    <li> Love this brush, this is my second one. (Don&#x27;t drop it on the tile floor, it breaks!) This brush is great for thick hair!</li>
    <li> Overpriced, but the best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. By using it, the brush will separates your hair in a way that your hair seems thicker, and it will dry much quicker because your hair is not clumping together. I barked at the price, but you only need to purchase it once, and it will be the best brush you can have forever.</li>
    <li> We love our Keratin brushes! We have ordered 4,  we just kept ordering! They are wonderful.  This brush is contoured and curves to your head. It feels like a massage f the scalp when you brush! The best part is the effects of using this brush.  The oils in your hair are somehow released to make your hair shinier.  You feel like you&#x27;ve just had a &amp;#34;blow out&amp;#34; that&#x27;s a term used for a wash and hair dry, even when you didn&#x27;t! It&#x27;s awesome.  Even my husband uses it!</li>
    <li> Hair dresser used this exact brush on my daughters long straight hair. Very lightweight, so you can style and dry easily, has the gripper handle. Love the concave design of this brush, dries hair quickly. We love it :)</li>
    <li> This brush actually does what they say it will do.  Much easier for me to use than the round bristle one.</li>
    <li> Although not as transporting ions to my hair for less frizz as I hoped (like my $6 ion comb), it is an excellent vent brush to de-tangle my thick, wavy hair when it is wet or dry with less breaking.</li>
    <li> Wonderful brush for drying........lifts hair much more easily when blow drying and leaves hair fuller.  Hair can be brushed and &amp;#34;lifted&amp;#34; whenever needed.  I wish I could have found this a lot sooner.  There is a less expensive one on Amazon also and I bought that one too.......it looks and performs exactly the same as the Keratin Complex one.  This would be a great brush for someone with really thick hair too.</li>
    <li> excellent for long hair, it&#x27;s so gentle and worth every penny! I bought 2, one for home and one for my purse, it&#x27;s so well made and extremely gentle for long hair! you will be pleased with the result after the sticker shock!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this brush for months after my hairdresser used it on my waist lenght hair. It un-tangles my hair without damageing it. Blow drying is faster and really makes my hair shine.</li>
