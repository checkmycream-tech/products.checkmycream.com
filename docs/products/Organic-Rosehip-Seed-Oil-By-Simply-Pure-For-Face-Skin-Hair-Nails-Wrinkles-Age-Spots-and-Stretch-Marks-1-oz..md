<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great, way less harsh than regular Retinol. If your skin starts drying out from other products this will help. Makes my skin look really healthy and smooth.</li>
    <li> Do not buy braks your face out in hives</li>
    <li> Have been using this for about a week and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference other than moisturizing my face.Get back in a couple of weeks to let you know if any improvement.</li>
    <li> Great product - good price</li>
    <li> Love the oil my face looks so smooth and fresh. I have been comments on how great my skin looks!</li>
    <li> It is the surprise that keeps on giving. My skin is feeling and looking so much better-healing properties are real.</li>
    <li> very good. It would be better if it is frangnet</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this to heal scars on my face but ended up using it on my neck and decollete region.  As others have posted, it has a bit of a pungent smell but quickly fades when applied.  I love how light weight it is.  It has also helped with minor skin damage in the decollete area.  I apply it at night--in the morning my skin looks so healthy and radiant!  Thank you, Simply Pure Skin Care!</li>
    <li> This is a great oil, and probably perfect for most people, but I&#x27;m still looking for the right oil blends for my face so that it doesn&#x27;t have irritation breakouts temporarily while the oil and moisturizers absorb.</li>
    <li> I love this product ! Organic rose hips treats my skin exceptionally well. My skin is smooth , with a wonderful glow and keeps my skin from becoming dry.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this. I use a derma roller on my face. The first time I did it I used something else and felt like I had acid on my face. I decided to do a little more research and seen to use rosehip oil. It made such a huge difference. I didn&#x27;t experience any discomfort at all, well except from the derma roller. This oil has helped my skin look better.</li>
    <li> It was such a sincere pleasure to work with Jan Williams of Simply Pure Skin Care company re: this review project for their Organic Rosehip Oil product. Jan is the president of the small company (based in Wildomar, California – USA) and a licensed esthetician; they sell other pure products made from emu oil and shea butter. ...Rosehips are known for their incredibly high Vitamin C content – many people make tea out of wild-harvested berries or buy the hulled berries at health stores for baking, jelly or tea...rich in antioxidants and essential fatty acids – which moisturize the skin and reduce the effects of exposure to sun and other elements (i.e. chemicals, pollution, cold and wind) that lead to premature aging and skin damage. Rosehip oil is also a rich source of Vitamin A. The cold-pressed oil is processed in small quantities and shipped to Amazon in weekly shipments in order to ensure the freshness and high quality of this product.</li>
    <li> My complexion has a smoother texture to it after using it for only a few weeks but i don&#x27;t like the smell at all.I suppose one can get used to it after using it for a while though!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still wondering about this product...update later</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell or the texture. Didn&#x27;t use it long enough to know if it works</li>
    <li> not too greasy, goes on smooth and absorbs quickly</li>
    <li> It is a beautiful oil that afforded me some wonderful Christmas gifts...:-)</li>
    <li> The smell isn&#x27;t all that great, but it works wonders! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am adding a few drops of this to my moisturizer at night and in the morning. Can feel my skin drinking all the benefits in......and feel like my skin glows!!! It is light.....and is easily absorbed. Truly love this beautiful little oil!!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural anti-aging product to use on my face. This product is amazing. I already see it working on my fine lines. My skin feels smooth, not oily. I recommend this product to anyone wanting better skin.</li>
    <li> I love love love this!!  I will never be without this oil again!</li>
    <li> Works good but smells bad. I mix a little with lotion. That&#x27;s why the 3 star rating.</li>
    <li> I was reading an article about beauty tips from a Victoria Secrets Model Miranda Kerr she stated she uses this rose hip oil in her beauty regime. I have been using it ever since, I am 51 years old and am amazed on how beautiful and glowing my skin is!  I even started using it on my own private clients I am an esthetician and make up artist. Happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid forties and wanted a product that would help with all of my skin concerns, such as spots of dryness, sun spots, uneven skin tone, elasticity, and most important something that could help my skin with cell turnover.  I found out this product does it all and even acts as a natural Retinol A, which I have wanted to try for years, but have heard that it can cause a lot of irritation.  I have somewhat oily skin, so I just use this at night and have replaced my &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; moisturizer for this and couldn&#x27;t be more please with the results already.  I love that this is ORGANIC and pure, with nothing added!!!  This will now be my go-to, all-in-one night time skin care :)</li>
    <li> Am 64 but my skin is wrinkle free, smooth and fine. I use Rosehip Oil for i know that Retinol is one of the best for the face. I use this one on top of Vit C Serum,  after my evening bath. I just use a single drop on my forehead, one on each of my cheeks, chin and neck and massage them until all the oil is evenly distributed.. I know my face and skin do not have the 64 yr old look. Everyone i meet and even old friends always compliment my skin and nobody would believe that i am 64. They always say i look like 45 to 48 only....i even put a drop on the back of my palms and massage them thoroughly, now my hands look really good. no wrinkles...and i don&#x27;t have to buy all those expensive lotions advertised commercially...but i wish that you will come up with discounts for regular user like me for i will this product for the rest of my life...</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This came as expected.  Doesn&#x27;t do anything great for my skin, I actually think it has dried my skin out a bit.</li>
    <li> My skin is loving this which is surprising. My skin breaks out with everything I have ever tried. My skin is so soft just after the first use.</li>
    <li> Smooth and effective.  Good product. Definitely worth using to minimize wrinkles and even out skin tone.  A very simple application is all it takes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best thing for your skin.</li>
    <li> Wish it came in a bigger bottle!</li>
    <li> I am using this to diminish dark spots since Rosehip seed oil is good for that. So far it has made my skin REALLY soft, since I use it as a serum at night. It&#x27;s not too oily, it&#x27;s really light and absorbs into my skin. I will update again in one month.</li>
    <li> Rosehip seed oil is the best moisturizer ever! I made a face cream with the rosehip seed oil, coconut oil, and a few other &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; ingredients. My acne scar has practically healed. My mother said my skin has never looked so good. She said I have a glow. I whipped her up some and now she is in love! I have spent so much money on moisturizers and miracle treatments in the past. Nothing has worked as well as the rosehip seed oil. What makes it even better is that it is NOT expensive. You will not go wrong using this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful for my skin--people keep telling me I&#x27;m glowing.  On humid days I leave my face wet after washing and just use a drop; on dry days I use three drops.  I will say that I don&#x27;t like the \\&quot;earthy\\&quot; smell they mention, so I sent for some Rose Otto Essential Oil* and added just a few drops.  Now it smells lovely--the earthiness makes the rose smell more complex, and rose oil is soothing to skin as well as nose.  The little bottle is convenient for traveling, too, though you should close the bottle very tight.  Don&#x27;t ask me how I know.    *Bulgaria- 100% PURE Rosa Damascena- 1 DRAM 1/8oz - Undiluted, No solvents - Gift Packaging -by High Altitude Organics (it&#x27;s a tiny tiny bottle, and therefore only about $30 as opposed to other bottles at $100).  Do get the distilled rather than solvent-extracted kind to avoid toxicity.</li>
    <li> This product performs as stated! It has left my skin hydrated and radiant! I love it!</li>
    <li> Great product! I have pretty bad sun damage on my chest and hands. This oil has been healing my skin very well! The only thing that has worked. I&#x27;m definitely pleased! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this product 3 weeks ago and let me tell you, this is so natural. After a week I started to notice that my stretch marks on my belly has cleared a lot, also my face feels soft and tighter. I will definitely buy more of this great organic Rosehip Oil. Very recommend it.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet. But for the size which is very very small the cost is very expensive. But I am hoping it will be worth the price when I use it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Takes care of my eczema on my face....</li>
    <li> Love this oil, I use it everyday, in my moisturizer, and with my foundation, with any lotion.  It has helped my dry skin SO MUCH!!</li>
    <li> I love this oil because it leaves my facial skin silky and soft! Even the skin on my feet becomes very smooth ! You only need a few drops; and although I have dry skin I don&#x27;t need any moisturizer after using the oil!&lt;br /&gt;You only have to get used to the smell - the first moment I opened the bottle I thought the oil has gone rancid. I asked for fresh bottle directly from the company and it had the same scent. The scent disappears almost instantly as soon as the oil is on your skin, so it is not bothering. After using the oil for a couple of weeks now, I actually don&#x27;t smell this &amp;#34;rancidness&amp;#34; anymore, reminds me now much more of  a very nutty, buttery Omega-3- oil (like Udo&#x27;s choice).</li>
    <li> I read an article where a London model talked about her most important beauty tips and the nightly use of organic rosehip oil was her number one treatment. Now of course this model is at the most 25 years of age and I am over 50 but I thought I would give it a try. You are to use just a few drops and work it into you face and wrinkles. It does a great job moisturing my skin without making it feel oily but I can&#x27;t see any real change in it after using it for about a month now. But the other day my mother asked what I was doing to my skin because it looks great. I told her about it and she asked me to order her a bottle immediately. I had to laugh because she is 83 and in a nursing home but she has always been diligent about caring for her skin. This is the bottle I ordered for her.</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin moist and helps clear scars. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Good product, swift delivery. I&#x27;m well pleased.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m completely new to the realm of essential oils and the other various carrier oils and the &amp;#34;recipes&amp;#34; used to DIY personal salves, lotions, soaps, and the like.  I started on this path because I&#x27;ve battled with allergies and skin conditions all of my life.  My teenage son has been encountering problems for the last 8-years, and I suspect my little girl will too eventually.  I&#x27;m on a mission to help my kids and myself.  The store brands (Aveeno) can only do so much for us short of filling a vat with the lotion and soaking for a few hours in it.&lt;br /&gt;After some research I found out about the excellent properties and benefits of the rosehip oil so I had to try.&lt;br /&gt;This may be a little on the spendy side for many folks, but consider that a very little bit goes a very long way and the benefits are astounding.  (I call this my &amp;#34;old lady oil&amp;#34; because of the reports I read about using it in wrinkle creams.)&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t just for old ladies though.  It is for those of us (young and old) who may suffer from excessively dry skin or embarrassing scar tissue.  For a first use, I applied this directly onto one of my son&#x27;s scaly patches resulting from contact with the metal on his jeans.  The next day he woke up and announced it was healing... for the first time in ages!  This is so much better than the steroid creams the doctors keep prescribing (and don&#x27;t work).</li>
    <li> Shameful that this product is almost gone and it has not been 30 days yet!!! I will foresee another order happening soon. No problems whatsoever to report.</li>
    <li> Great product! I had complained to my dermatologist that I was having trouble finding a moisturizer for my face that really penetrated the pores in my my skin. Most creams that I have used in the past just cover the surface of my skin without actually sinking in. She suggested trying rosehip oil. The first time I used this oil I could see and feel a difference. The skin on my face instantly had a rosey glow after I put it on, and there isn&#x27;t any oily residue left on my face. I also like that this is a 100% natural product only containing rosehip oil and nothing else; no additives or fillers. I use it daily with a glycolic serum and have had a handful of my friends comment on how good my skin looks, really! Since then, I have passed the word along to others and they have had similar experiences using this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this.  I have some expensive organic moisturizer that does make my skin feel sufficiently moisturized.  I put this over it and my skin feels great.  This will be what I used when I run out of the other stuff.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping,  so far so good. No complaints.  It has moisturized my dry skin well and I haven&#x27;t broken out. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Rosehip oil is the new &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34;, kind of like the pet rock only this brand makes your hands feel good.</li>
    <li> I love this product . I transforms your skin.</li>
    <li> Wonderful results!  Skin is so soft and moisturized after using a derma roller.</li>
    <li> Like giving your skin a drink of water. I gave this to a friend as part of her wedding present gift bag. She loves it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Made my skin really soft!</li>
    <li> This oil has done for my skin more than I could have ever imaged.  Combined with vitamin e cream I also bought on amazon works for rough parts on your arms feet and hands. It&#x27;s amazing</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and works well.  Didn&#x27;t break out my face</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it much. But I really love the smell of it</li>
    <li> My skin is softer to the touch after 3 weeks and I am satisfied with the product. Also helps dry cuticles. The smell dissipates after a while.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like this product, it has a really nasty smell to it and it doesn&#x27;t go away. I tried it a few times over two weeks and I just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin but I don&#x27;t think I used it enough. It&#x27;s not even worth packing it up for a refund.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully in my face cream recipe.  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> The organic Rosehip Oil is a bit too heavy for my face BUT I love it for my hair.</li>
    <li> Just after one night I am very happy. I applied it to my face before bed and in the morning my skin was very soft. I love the texture of it on my skin and how it plumps the lines that are starting to form above my upper lip. Tonight I am going to apply it to an eczema spot on my sons stomach and see how it helps for that. I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> This is a MIRACLE oil!!&lt;br /&gt;After only using it 1x a day 7 days a week  for the past 2 weeks. My acne is gone and my skin is glowing!!&lt;br /&gt;My husband is amazed by have fantastic my skin looks. I will be telling everyone about it.</li>
    <li> I use this as a cleanser and moisturizer and it&#x27;s done me good!  Makes your skin appear more healthy, glowing,  without and oily feel. Note: this is a dry essential oil and should be mixed with jojoba oil or some other oil to help moisturize more.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Absorbs quickly, no oily residue. I use hyaluronic acid and after it absorbs use this oil. I also use this oil with my derma roller. Results are amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it every night before bed and iv recognized a decrease in scaring after one week.</li>
    <li> good product.  would buy again.  professionally packaged and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for over 1 month and I&#x27;m almost done using it. I&#x27;ve been using it for my face mainly and a few times (once a week) for my body after shower. I&#x27;m not sure if I like this oil because I find it quite greasy after applying it and most importantly I don&#x27;t notice any change in my skin. It says it will help reduce acne scars, improve elasticity, etc., but I haven&#x27;t really noticed these changes. Perhaps I need to use this oil for longer period of time to see a noticeable change, but I find the oil quite expensive.    I discovered that there is another brand \\&quot;Skincare Radha Rosehip Oil\\&quot; on Amazon that sells organic cold pressed rosehip oil for a fraction of this product - $22 for 4oz (and at the time I bought this rosehip oil it was #14 for 1 oz). I am very curious to see how the quality compares. Has anybody used both? I wonder if this rosehip oil is significantly better in quality compared to the other one considering its much higher price.</li>
    <li> Great oil I use on my face. Absorbs into the skin, so you are not left with an oily feeling.  Biggest complaint I read in reviews was it smell like fish, there is Not a fishy smell, more like an earthy citrus, and odor does stay on your skin.</li>
