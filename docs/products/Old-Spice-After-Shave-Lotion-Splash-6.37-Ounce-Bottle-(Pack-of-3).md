      <li>My favorite.  </li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
      <li>My perception is that most women like the manly scent.  </li>

      <li>This is my dad&#x27;s favorite after shave lotion.  </li>
      <li>That is his favorite.</li>

      <li>My Dad&#x27;s favorite for years.</li>
      <li>Delighted to have been able to order it so easily and receive it so quickly..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more flowery and a bit off of even that; more like as a tomato plant is to a flower than a fragrance is even to cheap perfume.</li>
      <li>Glad to see Amazon makes it available.</li>
      <li>Good deal with fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Seema a bit more oily than original.  </li>
      <li>Occasionally I find something else that looks interesting or smells great</li>
      <li>This one is still sailing strong.</li>
      <li>Very happy I could fine just the aftershave without having to buy other items along with it that he won&#x27;t use.</li>
      <li>Everything when smoothly.</li>
      <li>Old Spice, that wonderful traditional smell that the ladies still love after all these years.  </li>
      <li>Really enjoy the smell.</li>
      <li>Have used old spice after shave for decades and this was a really good deal/buy and seller</li>
      <li>In retrospect, unless someone has found a way to get supplied by growers of the spices at the right costs, I cant see how anyone could do better.  </li>
      <li>Good deal to be sure on an old time favorite that never grows old...</li>
      <li>FRESH AND CLEAN!</li>
      <li>WORTH EVERY PENNY TO ME!</li>
      <li>Harder to find the Classic Scent in the after shave in my area so good to find it online at a good price.</li>
      <li>Introduced to me by my great uncle, who learned of it from his dad, a Confederate private, who became wealthy by marrying well - Old</li>
      <li>The three bottles (full size and not the downsized version for sale in the stores) arrived well packed.  </li>
      <li>To many &amp;#34;new scents&amp;#34; out there and P&amp;G is not making as much.</li>
      <li>Amazon graciously issued FULL credit for shipment, and allowed me to keep the product I received.  </li>
      <li>It is nice, but not like the old days.</li>
      <li>QUICK.  </li>
      <li>Old Spice remains the same good product after all of these years!</li>
      <li>Old spice is a classic and I will always choose it as my 1st go to for smelling good.</li>
      <li>Classic Old Spice Aftershave has a refreshing feeling and leaves a clean light</li>
      <li>Real men can be thankful that it is available on Amazon.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Leaves my face fresh - I always slap it on, so the alcohol sting isn&#x27;t noticeable on any inadvertant cuts.</li>
      <li>An old time favorite, never disappoints.</li>
      <li>After Shave  back in the forties (40&#x27;s) and how much I liked the smell of it.</li>
      <li>I WON&#x27;T BE BUYING ANY MORE OLD SPICE, BECAUSE</li>
      <li>He really wanted the original.</li>
      <li>But here on Amazon you can get it in a three pack that is in most cases tax free, and if you are a regular user of this fine after shave you can order it by subscription and get free shipping and at an even further discount.</li>
      <li>They continue to insist the product is right.</li>
      <li>At the right price.</li>
      <li>Love, love the old classic Old Spice - like my daddy wore and his daddy wore</li>
      <li>It brings back many great memories of years past.  </li>
      <li>The product was delivered on-time and was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a favorite scent, and for the cost, it really can&#x27;t be beat as a general go-to fragrance.</li>
      <li>Not as crisp, either.</li>
      <li>So far, the Old is the new for my dad, and it&#x27;s still my dad&#x27;s favorite!</li>
      <li>remember my grandfather using the Original Old Spice</li>
      <li>have used the Original Old Spice</li>
      <li>After noticing that the scent dissipated in about 3 or 4 hours, I did some online searching and found that Old Spice was having problems with the rising cost of the spices that made the original scent, and Proctor and Gamble bought them out.  </li>
      <li>He was in the Navy and only wore this kind of old spice.  </li>
      <li>Love the commercials, but this is not the Old Spice of old.</li>
      <li>Unlike fancier scents, Old Spice is available all over the place and not hard to find.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great value for a three pack</li>
    <li> I searched and had several options in finding and buying Old Spice After Shave Lotion Splash. I like to have my standby lotion in good supply without having to find it in a brick and mortar store</li>
    <li> Old Spice remains the same good product after all of these years!</li>
    <li> Husband has used this for years, never wants  to change...</li>
    <li> This package contains a lot of Old Spice.  3 bottles comes in a larger than expected package.  Bought as a gift for someone who likes the smell of Old Spice.</li>
    <li> Love the commercials, but this is not the Old Spice of old. There&#x27;s not much \\&quot;spicy\\&quot; about it. It&#x27;s more flowery and a bit off of even that; more like as a tomato plant is to a flower than a fragrance is even to cheap perfume. So, contrary to the outstanding commercial, its vaguely flowery, almost spiceless, scent will make you smell like a \\&quot;lady\\&quot;-- their words -- but one who hasn&#x27;t washed in a while since doing her run and trying on the toilet water her great granny bought at Woolworth&#x27;s to celebrate VJ day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: update to an after-shave? No. Update to customer service. Before buying this stuff, I wrote to them to ask if they&#x27;d reformulated it. Their failure to respond will be construed as, \\&quot;Refused to answer.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> What do you have to say about Old Spice? Introduced to me by my great uncle, who learned of it from his dad, a Confederate private, who became wealthy by marrying well - Old Spice?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my face fresh - I always slap it on, so the alcohol sting isn&#x27;t noticeable on any inadvertant cuts. My wife loves it!</li>
    <li> Got for my husband. Really enjoy the smell.</li>
    <li> This is so good to avoid store purchasing.  Very good value compared to store prices.</li>
    <li> My father is very particular with just about everything he wears, and usually sticks to the same exact things for a many years. So far, the Old is the new for my dad, and it&#x27;s still my dad&#x27;s favorite! Hence, I&#x27;ve purchased six (6) bottles in one Amazon order for a great price! :)</li>
    <li> I ordered a three-pack of Old Spice Classic After Shave but the box and and bottle that it was shipped to me is nothing like the labels I have ever seen before and I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice products for over 40 years. So I wonder if it is new packaging or maybe a knock off product. It smells like old spice but I wonder if it is fake.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to find this listed as \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; as my husband had once run across a lotion version of this aftershave, liked it, and then could never find it again.  So I ordered it for his Christmas stocking.  Once we opened it we realized it is just plain old aftershave \\&quot;splash\\&quot; instead of lotion.  Tried calling the company for 2 wks and was constantly sent to a full voice mail with no option of going anywhere else.  When they did call me, I could not even understand the person &amp; eventually gave up trying to communicate with him.  They continue to insist the product is right. However, they ARE finally issuing me a refund once I return the product.</li>
    <li> This made a perfect gift for my grandfather, who&#x27;s worn it for years. It&#x27;s hard to find the original around here these days. The product was delivered on-time and was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Its what my dad wanted,he hasn&#x27;t found in stores for some time</li>
    <li> I used other alcohol based aftershaves before and none have done the damage this product has done. I don&#x27;t have that sensitive of skin and this product made my skin crack after one use if you have sensitive to regular skin steer clear of this product.</li>
    <li> old spice has been around for many a year.&lt;br /&gt;Still has the best fragrant of any after shave on the market.</li>
    <li> The product arrive as scheduled, and worked properly!</li>
    <li> Great Price and product!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out, price is good, shipping is free (with Prime)and no sales tax.  Local stores seem to want to maximize their price, plus I save a trip.  It&#x27;s the same lotion I&#x27;ve used for years, it&#x27;s just easier to have on hand.</li>
    <li> Outstanding Product Line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember my grandfather using the Original Old Spice After Shave  back in the forties (40&#x27;s) and how much I liked the smell of it. It had all the characteristics of a real man&#x27;s After Shave.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Original Old Spice After Shave ever since I started to shave back in the fifties (50&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;It is very disappointing that they have discontinued making the Original&lt;br /&gt;Old Spice After Shave.&lt;br /&gt;I would incourage them to bring it back into production. ASAP PLEASE!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John B. Trainer&lt;br /&gt;The Trailblazer</li>
    <li> STILL THE ONE MY HUSBAND LIKES BEST, BUT FOR SOME REASON IS HARD TO FIND.&lt;br /&gt;I LIKE IT TOO, SO GLAD WE CAN GET IT FROM AMAZON.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t think there is much I can add to all the glowing testimonials to this Old Spice classic scent. I have been using it on and off for over 40 years now.  Occasionally I find something else that looks interesting or smells great and I defect for a while.  But like the proverbial old shoe in the end I return to Old Spice every time. Simply put, Old Spice has a great old time scent that is brisk, lasts a long time, and is very invigorating after a shave, or just when you feel like being refreshed. It has a low alcohol content and is never overpowering.  There really isn&#x27;t anything I have ever found that smells just like it, or manages to make the formula so well. Unlike fancier scents, Old Spice is available all over the place and not hard to find. But here on Amazon you can get it in a three pack that is in most cases tax free, and if you are a regular user of this fine after shave you can order it by subscription and get free shipping and at an even further discount. Good deal to be sure on an old time favorite that never grows old...</li>
    <li> Same scent I used in the 50&#x27;s to capture my wife of 53 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we get to start all over, or think we can</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my Dad. He very pleased with it. He said it is just like he remembered it from years ago</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s there to say. It&#x27;s Old Spice aftershave from Proctor and Gamble. You either like it a lot or you use something else.</li>
    <li> Have used old spice after shave for decades and this was a really good deal/buy and seller did everything they had advertised on a very timely manner  QUICK.  Thank You</li>
    <li> my father in law loves it</li>
    <li> The wife has always loved it . . . Happy wife happy life!</li>
    <li> An old time favorite, never disappoints.</li>
    <li> Is my after shave lotion...  THANKS</li>
    <li> The three bottles (full size and not the downsized version for sale in the stores) arrived well packed.  Good price.</li>
    <li> Old Spice is the classic personal aftershave.  This IS your father&#x27;s aftershave.  An American standard for several generations.  If it has fallen out of favor with a younger generation, it is only because it is they haven&#x27;t come to fully appreciate its perfection of purpose.</li>
    <li> This is my dad&#x27;s favorite after shave lotion.  It was hard to find in our local stores, but fortunately we found it on Amazon.  It has a nice scent.</li>
    <li> I actually did not know that Old Spice no longer existed until I bought this product.  After noticing that the scent dissipated in about 3 or 4 hours, I did some online searching and found that Old Spice was having problems with the rising cost of the spices that made the original scent, and Proctor and Gamble bought them out.  In retrospect, unless someone has found a way to get supplied by growers of the spices at the right costs, I cant see how anyone could do better.  No complaints, just sympathy.  Happens to all of us somehow, changing times.</li>
    <li> I have been using traditional Old Spice after shave lotion for  50 years.  My perception is that most women like the manly scent.  Alas, the classic bottle can be sometimes difficult to find in stores.  Real men can be thankful that it is available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Yes...the same Old Spice I remember my dad using. It&#x27;s now in plastic rather than glass but the classic fragrance there 100%.</li>
    <li> Could not find this anywhere.  My husband really wanted it. Everything when smoothly. It will last him a long time, I think.</li>
    <li> MY GRANDDAD USED THIS AND STARTED GIVING IT TO ME FOR X-MAS BACK IN THE &#x27;50S. I DIDN&#x27;T USE MUCH OF IT AS A KID, BUT I LIKEEDIT. AND IT BURNED LIKE HE**. BY THE TIME I BEGAN TO SHAVE IN ABOUT &#x27;67 IS ACTUALLY STARTED USING IT AS AN AFTER SHAVE AND IT BURNED LIKE HE**. EVEN THO I HAD BRUT, CANOE, ENGLISH LEATHER, ETC. (THE BIG NAMES AT THE TIME) MOST GIRLS WOULD USUALLY COMMENT ON OLD SPICE. OLD SPICE WAS SOLD TO PROCTOR &amp; GAMBLE IN THE EARLY &#x27;90S. THEY CHANGED THE LOGO FROM THE SHIP TO A \\&quot;YACHT\\&quot;, THEN CHANGED FROM THE GLASS BOTTLE TO A PLASTIC BOTTLE, NOW, THE LAST I BOUGHT, SEVERAL MONTHS AGO SMELLS NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL--IT SMELLS EXACTLY LIKE THE \\&quot;POWDER FRESH SCENT SECRET DEOCORANT\\&quot;--GUESS I WON&#x27;T BE BUYING ANY MORE OLD SPICE, BECAUSE IT JUST ISN&#x27;T BEING MADE ANYMORE---</li>
    <li> I like buying several at a time so I don&#x27;t have to worry about finding the product locally.  This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased the products from Amazon and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> It is nice, but not like the old days. O bought this for my 65 years old father. I wanted to return hom for his old days memories, but it wasn&#x27;t like that</li>
    <li> Same stuff easy shopping and less expensive</li>
    <li> watered down compared to a few years ago.  Seems like a different fragrance too.</li>
    <li> GOOD FOR PRICE. USE IT AS PRE-SHAVE</li>
    <li> Have been using Old Spice After Shave for 65 years, It is still as good as ever.</li>
    <li> this is the only smell he likes. i have tried many others and he always comes back to the same ole thing.</li>
    <li> Dad never smelled like anything else. Bought it for his 90th birthday!!</li>
    <li> Been using it for years. My dad&#x27;s brand, and probabl his dad&#x27;s as well. I&#x27;ll stick with the classic. I&#x27;ve tried other brands, other fragrances. This one is still sailing strong. My wife likes it, too, which counts for a lot!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my life-time favorable &#x27;after shave lotion&#x27;, but not many stores carry this brand these days except Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Classic Old Spice Aftershave has a refreshing feeling and leaves a clean light fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;It is comparably affordable.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, my Dad used it.</li>
    <li> My wife likes the smell</li>
    <li> smells just like the old</li>
    <li> Seema a bit more oily than original.  Not as crisp, either.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for about 50 years. Not easy to find in local stores. Glad to see Amazon makes it available.</li>
    <li> It made me remember when I went to the barber, and sit in those chairs .. red one&#x27;s .. the after shave, was very close what it just to be.</li>
    <li> It brings back many great memories of years past.  Great after shave lotion</li>
    <li> Love, love the old classic Old Spice - like my daddy wore and his daddy wore and I wear.</li>
    <li> I was having trouble finding classic Old Spice locally, so I ordered online and very pleased with the big bottle.</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I like this Old Spice After Shave splash - have used it off and on over the last 30 years plus.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with Old Spice!</li>
    <li> Gift for my dad.  He was in the Navy and only wore this kind of old spice.  the stores carry new and improved.  He really wanted the original.</li>
    <li> My Dad&#x27;s favorite for years. Very happy I could fine just the aftershave without having to buy other items along with it that he won&#x27;t use. Delivered right away and the packaging was great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best after shave.</li>
    <li> Bought the Old Spice as a Christmas gift.  Very hard to find the Classic these days in the stores.  That is his favorite.</li>
    <li> Old Spice originals are still the best products. I&#x27;ve been using this for 50 years. My Dad used them before me.</li>
    <li> My favorite.  At the right price.</li>
    <li> Old Spice, that wonderful traditional smell that the ladies still love after all these years.  Unfortunately Amazon listed this as a 3-Pack, and I purchased two, only to receive 2 bottles rather than two 3-packs.  I contacted them and discovered they had removed the item from their listings as the 3-packs were no longer available and not discovered until several customers reported the issue.  Amazon graciously issued FULL credit for shipment, and allowed me to keep the product I received.  As always, AMAZON DOES A GREAT JOB even when a shipping error is involved.  Thank you Amazon for stepping up to the plate and handling this so professionally.  GREAT JOB!!!</li>
    <li> The good stuff!  I have been using this for 40 years.  The price here is far better than my local stores.</li>
    <li> It was getting difficult to find this product in our local shops. Needless to say, we found it very easily at Amazon. Delighted to have been able to order it so easily and receive it so quickly..</li>
    <li> Like a lot of guys, we&#x27;ve been using this for many years. It&#x27;s still a favorite scent, and for the cost, it really can&#x27;t be beat as a general go-to fragrance. If just feels like it&#x27;s part of the fabric of America. It&#x27;s a fragrance I grew up on, and my Dad used it too. I suspect it will be around for a long, long time. And that&#x27;s a good thing. And buying them in packs of 3, here on Amazon, is the best deal. Subscribe and Save makes it even better. Definitely much cheaper than my local drug store. We prefer the switch to plastic bottles too. And the fragrance itself is not overpowering, but masculine and lasts.</li>
    <li> Harder to find the Classic Scent in the after shave in my area so good to find it online at a good price.</li>
    <li> Made an excellent Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> It was for my 95 year old father, he loves the stuff. He has used it for years. It doesn&#x27;t look the same but it suits him well.</li>
    <li> better price than I thought</li>
    <li> has not changed in 50 years... and that is as it should be</li>
    <li> Having a hard time finding this scent. To many &amp;#34;new scents&amp;#34; out there and P&amp;G is not making as much. I don&#x27;t like the new scents and I wish more of us would speak up.</li>
    <li> Product as promised and delivered on time.</li>
    <li> STILL THE BEST OVERALL FOR ME. TO EACH THEIR OWN. FRESH AND CLEAN! I STILL LOVE IT! WORTH EVERY PENNY TO ME!</li>
    <li> I ordered to my husband, he loved it!</li>
    <li> I would hope you have more scents that come along with after shave.. Otherwise it&#x27;s a good value..Would purchase again with other scents</li>
    <li> Good deal with fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Look at my rating, now look at my review, now look at the picture....  Old spice is a classic and I will always choose it as my 1st go to for smelling good.</li>
    <li> quic kship and nice price</li>
    <li> The quality of the product was excellent and it has not lost any of its original value. THe Pack of three worked very well and was comparable to the cost at local stores.</li>
    <li> THIS SPELL VERY NICE MY HUSBAND IS SO GLAD HE CAN THE CLASSIC OLD SPICE.</li>
    <li> love the scent. wish it lasted longer</li>
    <li> I have used for many years and glad to get it on Amazon.</li>
