      <li>Loved it!  </li>
      <li>Great customer service</li>
      <li>arrived  as promsed and pkg was great.</li>
      <li>I received a trial of this fragrance in my Sephora order and loved it.</li>
      <li>This was a really good buy.</li>
      <li>Wonderful fragrance and arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>I really love this fragrance and this was a great price for it.  </li>
      <li>I love this fragrance!</li>
      <li>Let me just say, &amp;#34;I love this perfume!</li>
      <li>This is a very light fragrance</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT</li>
      <li>Completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I ordered it...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sexy and sophisticated.</li>
      <li>great product fast shipment</li>
      <li>I love using it and will continue to keep it in my closet.</li>
      <li>Really enjoy the fragrance, it&#x27;s refreshing but not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>It was sweeter and does remind me of Love&#x27;s Baby Soft, but it&#x27;s more sophisticated.</li>
      <li>I have shopped at department stores and also duty free.</li>
      <li>Also, the price is fantastic.</li>
      <li>It smells great on my skin and has a long wear time.</li>
      <li>The floral top notes wear off too fast.</li>
      <li>This scent is floral, fresh, powdery but not too floral.</li>
      <li>I will most likely give it as a gift at times.</li>
      <li>I love a scent that is so alluring that in passing a man you can hear him taking a second breath, chances are you will encounter him again.  </li>
      <li>Does not last but an hour....or two at the most, booo.  </li>
      <li>But if you can find me Calvin Klein orchid at a decent price I would be in hog heaven!</li>
      <li>The fragrance is quite feminine, not overly florid and sweet, it is calmed by woody aromas, subtle spice and some kind of herbaciousness that I cannot place.  </li>
      <li>I really like it.  </li>
      <li>THANKS MATO</li>
      <li>Unique but powdery low notes.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this fragrance, very feminine, soft and stays on a long time.  </li>
      <li>Wear it for an everyday scent or a sexy date night attention</li>
      <li>I was looking for a new perfume to wear and had gotten a sample of this in a magazine...</li>
      <li>I opted for the refund because a new one would not have arrived in time for my trip.  </li>
      <li>It is supposed to smell light  and flowery, but ended up with a slight plastic smell.</li>
      <li>The only reason it does not get 5 stars is that the fragrance fades quickly after a short time.  </li>
      <li>I added it to my Christmas wish list for my husband and he surprised me with it.</li>
      <li>The fragrance was lovely and the bottle is a nice presentation; however, it is very faint and only lasts a short while.</li>

<li> Not great, not sure I should continue to buy perfume on the Internet.  </li>

    <li> Let me just say, &amp;#34;I love this perfume! This scent is floral, fresh, powdery but not too floral. It&#x27;s sexy and sophisticated. Wear it for an everyday scent or a sexy date night attention grabber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally, I had this perfumed shipped to me a couple of days ago but the perfume was cracked.  I contacted PerfumesWorld and they responded immediately. Another bottle was shipped to me within 3 days with no hassle. Great customer service and I will be buying from them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making me a happy customer!</li>
    <li> Not great, not sure I should continue to buy perfume on the Internet.  It is supposed to smell light  and flowery, but ended up with a slight plastic smell.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Unique but powdery low notes. The floral top notes wear off too fast. This is a very light fragrance</li>
    <li> arrived  as promsed and pkg was great. Also, price was very good.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is quite feminine, not overly florid and sweet, it is calmed by woody aromas, subtle spice and some kind of herbaciousness that I cannot place.  The only reason it does not get 5 stars is that the fragrance fades quickly after a short time.  I wonder what is missing.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this fragrance, very feminine, soft and stays on a long time.  I love using it and will continue to keep it in my closet.</li>
    <li> great product fast shipment</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last long enough through out the day.  I don&#x27;t get compliments on it after a long day at work where as I do with my usual fragrance called Design.</li>
    <li> I received a trial of this fragrance in my Sephora order and loved it. I added it to my Christmas wish list for my husband and he surprised me with it. The instant I sprayed it on, I realized it was not the same as the Eu de Toilette included in my Sephora order. It was sweeter and does remind me of Love&#x27;s Baby Soft, but it&#x27;s more sophisticated. It smells great on my skin and has a long wear time.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy the fragrance, it&#x27;s refreshing but not overpowering.  I&#x27;ve got several compliments on the fragrance, women have asked &amp;#34;what&#x27;s that you&#x27;re wearing..it smells so good&amp;#34;.  Even my husband like it!</li>
    <li> This perfume met all of my expectations.  I really like it.  I will get it again.  I will most likely give it as a gift at times.</li>
    <li> I love a scent that is so alluring that in passing a man you can hear him taking a second breath, chances are you will encounter him again.  Romance involves all the senses, be daring step out of the flower shop.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new perfume to wear and had gotten a sample of this in a magazine...I&#x27;m so glad I ordered it...it smells wonderful! I&#x27;m hooked on Dahlia!</li>
    <li> The fragrance was lovely and the bottle is a nice presentation; however, it is very faint and only lasts a short while.</li>
    <li> Loved it!  But if you can find me Calvin Klein orchid at a decent price I would be in hog heaven!</li>
    <li> I really love this fragrance and this was a great price for it.  However, I was unable to enjoy it because the bottle arrived damaged.  It was broken so I could not use it.  I contacted Amazon and they immediately resolved my concerns.  They gave me two options--refund or reship.  Since I wanted to take it on vacation with me I opted for the refund because a new one would not have arrived in time for my trip.  They indeed refunded the purchase.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT THANKS MATO</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance! Also, the price is fantastic. I have shopped at department stores and also duty free. This was a really good buy.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s an eau de toilette, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last at all. Must be a knock off</li>
    <li> Does not last but an hour....or two at the most, booo.  Not worth the price.  I won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too keen on it. I had to give it away.</li>
    <li> I like this and you can take on the airplane.</li>
    <li> Excelent product. Completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> it Was a gift, recommended, fragance .</li>
