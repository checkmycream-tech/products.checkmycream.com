    <li> The product I received was nothing like what you would buy in the stores. The conditioner smelled bad and chemically and was a much thinner consistency than store bought conditioner.  It also did not condition my hair at all!!!! DO NOT BUY!! I am very unhappy!</li>
    <li> I love Biolage and sometimes it can get expensive to continue buying it. When I do use it which is 98% of time, I love it! It makes my hair smell awesome and so soft! I would use Biolage everything if I could afford it. I am dedicated and use it regularly.</li>
    <li> Definitely better than most off the shelf products. Still looking for better hair product that leaves hair shiny with body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Biolage products and have been using off and on for many years. I received this on time which is good as I was about ready to run out of my Pureology.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a month now and the only difference i have noticed is that my hair tangles easier! and the last night when i washed my hair, the conditioner texture felt different, like sticky... I don&#x27;t think i will purchase this again...</li>
    <li> trying to find a product that helps hold the color in my hair longer and so far it is doing just that</li>
    <li> This combo is ok.  I don&#x27;t notice any difference between the Matrix Biolage and any other less expensive shampoo and conditioner.  My hair is fine-textured, short, and a little thinner than it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice; not overpowering.</li>
    <li> GREAT product! It really helped the red color stay in my hair.  I&#x27;m not nuts about the smell of the conditioner but I&#x27;m extremely scent-sensitive. I wish it came in scentless version.</li>
    <li> Great product leaves my long, thick, color treated hair soft and silky all day long.</li>
    <li> What ever was in this bottle was not matrix color shampoo and conditioner! I use it all the time. I know the smell and how my hair feels when I use it. I always thought Amazon vendors would be safe but this made me doubt!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in this product with the exception my forehead broke out after two uses. So have decided to use occasionally rather than all the time. May experiment again to see if I get any breaking out. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order again, but will continue to use the brand.</li>
    <li> I personally do not use this product,  but my wife likes it.  Amazon had a better price than my local stores.</li>
    <li> very good price, always go back to this set because it works,tried so many cheaper ones and more higher priced ones, but come back.&lt;br /&gt;love the small so fresh.will be back 4 more.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the matrix biolage shampoo/conditioner for years. It is a quality item and great product. Recieved my order quickly and in sealed packaging.</li>
    <li> Biolage makes great shampoo. I know Biolage and Matrix are the same company but I don&#x27;t know if the products are the same. Love this shampoo and conditioner as well as the Volumizer Shampoo.</li>
    <li> Fast and shipped really fast. I love it. Great deal. I like that they tapped the tops to make sure the bottles didnt open</li>
    <li> I have ordered several other hair care products from Amazon and have been perfectly satisfied however this is very disappointing.  I dont think this is the real Color Care Therapie Shampoo from Matrix or the product that I recieved was damaged. The color, smell and consistency is different when compared to my salon purchased product. I am afraid to use it on my color treated hair as it seemed to start to change the texture.&lt;br /&gt; I wrote a letter to the company but have not yet heard anything yet.  I will be much more leary in purchasing salon type products online but thought Amazon would help screen for legitimate businesses. Well see if i hear back from the company I purchased it from or Amazon.</li>
