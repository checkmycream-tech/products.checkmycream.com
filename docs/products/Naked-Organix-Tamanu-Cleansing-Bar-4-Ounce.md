<li> has now been using this soap for three weeks and to be honest, it has made his face worse, not better.</li>

<li> my skin felt very soft and it gloed a little.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
<li> , why is it making my skin so dry?</li>
<li> My skin gets SO dry during the winter months.</li>
<li> Does not appear to dry skin, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be moisturing either.</li>
<li> but i have this flaky dry skin?  </li>
<li> I used to have dry itchy skin on my shins, but since switching to this soap my skin has healed and no longer gets dry - even in the winter.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and helps even out my skin tone.</li>
<li> husband deals with constant breakouts on his face and has had a difficult time locating a product that&#x27;s both natural and works well to clear up his face.&lt;br</li>
<li> These are all VERY expensive oils and top shelf.  </li>
<li> What I noticed when I used it was that it doesn&#x27;t make me break out, but it definitely feels as though it dries out my skin and makes it feel tight.</li>
<li> Yeah those oils are that expensive, BUT worth it!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> like this on my skin, and may try other bars by Organix..................</li>
<li> It sat in my cabinet for about 4 months until I finally ran out of my usual stuff.  </li>
<li> I bought this soap based on other reviews that have stated that it has helped with acne.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
<li> By Tuesday my face was so dry it was flaky round my cheeks and nose and the rim of my nostrils were even sore!!  </li>
<li> I am anxious to see how my husband&#x27;s fungal toes improve.</li>
<li> So I ordered this soap instead even though I usually like liquid vs bar soap.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m usually a combination skin type.  </li>
<li> Guess we&#x27;ll keep looking for something for my husband that works well and doesn&#x27;t make the situation worse.</li>
<li> He has commented that since he&#x27;s been using this, his face seems to be getting worse, not</li>
<li> WTF?  </li>
<li> I base my stars on the following:&lt;br /&gt;It</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Purchased this for a friend with eczema, and he Loved it! He said the cleansing bar left his skin soft and supple and not so itchy. Therefore, he didn&#x27;t scratch at the sores. Great product! It arrived as stated and on time.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SOAP!  .......OVER TIME IT WILL CHANGE THE APPRERANCE OF YOUR SKIN - TO MORE EVEN TONE SKIN...Item arrived on time, I ordered next day delivery.  ;) I WAS VERY PLEASED!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t help with my eczema.</li>
    <li> I was having severe dryness, itchy skin, sores on my body, my daughter mention this to me so I order it, starting using it right away, I have no dry skin,sores healing up, very moisturized, soft and no greasy feeling, loving this Tamanu Soap leaves you clean and fresh. I would never do a review like this if I didnt experience WONDERFUL results from using this product.</li>
    <li> Bought it on a Saturday.  Used it 1x on SAT, 2x on Sun, 2x on Monday.  By Tuesday my face was so dry it was flaky round my cheeks and nose and the rim of my nostrils were even sore!!  I will try to stick with it because of the good reviews but man, why is it making my skin so dry? I&#x27;m usually a combination skin type.  I&#x27;m waking up with it feeling oily in the middle of the night but i have this flaky dry skin?  WTF?  Never have I ever experienced such an imbalance before.  AND IT SAYS ON THE LABEL: BALANCING BAR......</li>
    <li> The scent is mild, but not particulary refreshing.  Does not appear to dry skin, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be moisturing either.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! Sometimes bar soap can be drying, but this leaves my skin feeling very clean but not squeaky and tight. I have battled chest and back acne since I was a teen, and without chemicals I haven&#x27;t been able to combat it. This soap has worked wonders for me, and I will continue to buy it. I would recommend it for sure!</li>
    <li> I had heard good things about Tamanu oil helping with skin problems.  I tried the straight oil first and couldn&#x27;t get passed the smell.  So I ordered this soap instead even though I usually like liquid vs bar soap.  It sat in my cabinet for about 4 months until I finally ran out of my usual stuff.  I pulled it out and figured I would give it a try.  It wasn&#x27;t until I had been using it for about a month when I realized that I completely quit breaking out on my back. I was too scared to use this on my face so I am still breaking out there. I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference with my dryness but I did not break out in eczema on my hands while using this product either.  I will definitely be reordering this product. Update: I finally starting using this on my face and it has made a huge difference there as well.  I had been using Retin-A for a while with some results but when I added this, I practically stopped breaking out.  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This soap helps keep my skin clear. Bought a bar for my daughter and she can see a difference in her skin.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for all types of skin and men also.</li>
    <li> I bought this to go with the oil of the same and it is really nice, glad I got it.</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering, and I believe I will be a life long user.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I used to have dry itchy skin on my shins, but since switching to this soap my skin has healed and no longer gets dry - even in the winter.</li>
    <li> This is a great soap for my face. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and helps even out my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I AM a soap maker by trade. I try all kinds of soap for the fun of it and to learn all that I can. I never re-buy soap since I make it. This could be my exception!  I have gained a real respect for Tamanu oil and all that it can do. Yes what kind of soap you use DOES make a difference. What&#x27;s in YOUR soap? The oils listen in this soap are and in this order:  Olive Oil (extremely moisturizing, can&#x27;t beat it), Coconut oil (used in this case for foaming instead of using a chemical but very good for skin! ) Palm Oil, (moisturizing),  Tamanu Oil (high on the list so there is a fair amount in there),  Shea butter (to die for),  jojoba oil (amazing stuff again for skin) Rosemary seed Extract (usually used to keep the bar fresh but also brings nice qualities to the skin).  This list rocks!! These are all VERY expensive oils and top shelf.  When you look at the price and want to walk away may I just say that I dare bet there isn&#x27;t a lot of profit in that bar. Yeah those oils are that expensive, BUT worth it!!&lt;br /&gt;I am very critical with soap. Nothing but nothing can beat my bar of soap. That is why I try everyones to make sure....well here it is. A great bar of soap. I base my stars on the following:&lt;br /&gt;It foams really well.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;It rinses off clean, you ARE clean. You will feel the difference&lt;br /&gt;If you have skin issues this bar is the real deal for you.&lt;br /&gt;All the oils picked will moisture is the skin really well but will also help to heal.&lt;br /&gt;Love it love it love it.  Way to go!! Two thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> This is sold as a 4 oz bar.  Its now a 3.6 oz bar,  They need to correct the description.</li>
    <li> my daughter is very happy with effects of the cleansing bar in clearing up her complexion.</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing Bar. It made my skin face feel much tighter and smoother.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> I have only just recently received the soap but have used it on my face a couple times now. Skin feels really clean and the second time I didn&#x27;t even use a moisturizer and it feels fine and not dry. I will use it more and give a newer update soon. I purchased this based on the reviews of others, so I thank you all for your input. I am anxious to see how my husband&#x27;s fungal toes improve.</li>
    <li> Works great for psoriasis. It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found to give relief!</li>
    <li> my skin felt very soft and it gloed a little.  I really enjoyed this soap.  I would order it again in the near future thank you</li>
    <li> This product arrived within only two days of ordering it! I have extremely dry skin and have yet to find a soap that I love until now!! will definitely have to order more!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this soap based on other reviews that have stated that it has helped with acne.&lt;br /&gt;My husband deals with constant breakouts on his face and has had a difficult time locating a product that&#x27;s both natural and works well to clear up his face.&lt;br /&gt;He has now been using this soap for three weeks and to be honest, it has made his face worse, not better. He&#x27;s gone from a few pimples to a full-fledged breakout across his whole face. The pimples are smaller than normal, but they are by far more numerous and his face seems oilier than it was prior to using this soap. He has commented that since he&#x27;s been using this, his face seems to be getting worse, not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not suffer from breakouts on my face, so I figured that I would give the soap a try and see how it did for my skin. What I noticed when I used it was that it doesn&#x27;t make me break out, but it definitely feels as though it dries out my skin and makes it feel tight. I am no longer using it on my face, but it seems to work well for the rest of my body, and it lathers nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might work great for some with acne or skin breakouts, but it&#x27;s certainly not a cure-all for everyone dealing with skin issues. Guess we&#x27;ll keep looking for something for my husband that works well and doesn&#x27;t make the situation worse.</li>
    <li> The soap is visible good, cleans well, face fells smooth, I use it after I used scrubs and want a final clean.I like the natural products, but I did not use it long enough to tell a difference. I use argan oil for may face anyway and i noticed a diminishing in acne in about 6 months of use. The hydration is superior to everything I tried before. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> like this on my skin, and may try other bars by Organix..................not drying at all...........so far pleased with the bar</li>
    <li> feels great. the smell is nice. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I  clean my face is very nice I love it</li>
    <li> Very nice soap.  I use it in the shower as a first quick wash for my face.  Gentle, something about using it just feels right.  I have no idea what tamanu is, but I like it.  I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> My skin gets SO dry during the winter months. (that seem to last forever in the North East) so I thought I&#x27;d try this. Its great! Eliminated the redness of my skin and left it feeling so much bette! Calmer ~</li>
    <li> Used with the moisturizer it as a wonderful feel to the skin.</li>
