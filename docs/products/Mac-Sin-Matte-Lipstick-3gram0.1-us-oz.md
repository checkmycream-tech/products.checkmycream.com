<li> People reviewing saying the lipstick is dry or doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly: I always apply a thin amount of Chapstick before I apply my lipstick...</li>

    <li> Love the color! Good shipping time as well.</li>
    <li> Nice choice, lipstick shade in person is the same as picture</li>
    <li> Very well pigmented and matte. The dark color suits any skin tone. People reviewing saying the lipstick is dry or doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly: I always apply a thin amount of Chapstick before I apply my lipstick... I never have had that problem as well</li>
    <li> everything you think it is..awesome!!! I get soo many compliments. Looks great on all skin tones.</li>

    <li> I have SIN by MAC and the color on this picture is not the right color. SIN is a brown color not a plum color. False advertisement</li>
    <li> Again.  It is MAC.  High quality and perfect.</li>
    <li> This lipstick looks great it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s not as creamy as I expected and it&#x27;s just a little bit harder to apply. Also when I apply it it&#x27;s kind of blotchy but I think it&#x27;s because I never put on lip liner. Overall I love this color!</li>
    <li> Definitely my fav so far love the way it compliments my skin tone. Already have tons og compliments!</li>
