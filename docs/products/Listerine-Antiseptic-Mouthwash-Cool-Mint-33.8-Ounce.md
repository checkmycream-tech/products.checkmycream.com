      <li>and I have excellent dental health.</li>
      <li>Listerine is the best product i know of that can do it all.</li>
      <li>Great stuff - works as promised - great taste.  </li>
      <li>the product itself works great for me.</li>
      <li>I thought it was just great</li>
      <li>perfect for having fresh breath and a perfect mouth antiseptic.</li>
      <li>This mouthwash is easily the best mouthwash I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I had this 33.8 ounce bottle of Listerine with me in the dorms and this fat girl laughed at me.</li>
      <li>You know after a good brush the icing on the cake is some good ol Listerine.</li>
      <li>I have never had a dental carie and my gums are in good condition.</li>
      <li>i have a good oral hygiene habbit</li>
      <li>The price is fair and not a bargain</li>
      <li>but do it, it is important that you get the best care for your teeth and gums.</li>
      <li>and I am skinny and good looking.</li>
      <li>After gargling with Listerine, my mouth smells kissably good according to my partner.</li>
      <li>I believe being a dedicated user of Listerine has helped my oral hygine tremendously!!!  </li>
      <li>Very pleased.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is nice because using this twice a day</li>
      <li>And With this particular Listerine your&#x27;e good for 24 hours,now how great is that.</li>
      <li>And of all the ones out there, Cool Mint dominates them all!!  </li>
      <li>I once heard that a majority of the germs a person comes in contact with throughout the day enter through the mouth and most of them incubate and spread from the throat.</li>
      <li>It was minty and refreshing.</li>
      <li>You got to love the shipping at your doorstep when you do not want to venture out to the parking lots and lines.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s refreshing without being overly minty.  </li>
      <li>I say,maybe you are paying more for Listerine mouth wash</li>
      <li>They used to be my go to store, now I find myself looking elsewhere to find better pricing.</li>
      <li>Some people may not care, and would see that extra costs as a convenience factor for not having to drive to the store to pick it up, but if you are looking for the best price, then keep looking.</li>
      <li>Costco has a better price.</li>
      <li>I want you to know how much I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I have always used Listerine for most of my life.</li>
      <li>wash more and more.  </li>
      <li>The taste is great, and the mouthwash leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>but I tend to gravitate to Cool Mint, which I guess is the most popular flavor.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ll never forget my Cool Mint Listerine!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s flavor is more COOL then MINT -</li>
      <li>For that &amp;#34;kissable&amp;#34; fresh breath and healthy mouth</li>
      <li>great for daily use, everything as explained on the label.</li>
      <li>in all it is great, as long as you use it as directed.</li>
      <li>okay first of all i used this product for 3 weeks... 2-3 times a day    </li>
      <li>old man used to use the original kind - came in a glass bottle - stung like battery acid.  </li>
      <li>I found that as a standard mouthwash it was as good as it got.</li>
      <li>oh its true alcohol in mouthwash is cancer productive, and by that</li>
      <li>Listerine is powerful, I enjoy the Cool mint flavor.</li>
      <li>The Listerine Antiseptic mouthwash had a taste that was okay to good, nothing like the previous taste that I had remembered without found memories.</li>
      <li>but it was something I needed quick without going to the market.  </li>
      <li>The 5 minutes you spend flossing, brushing, and swishing is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I rarely use floss.</li>
      <li>Yes, it cost a little more, but then again the best products usually do, and my teeth are worth it!</li>
      <li>I know I have a clean mouth when I am done, I just can&#x27;t taste anything for a few hours after ;)  Good product, dentist recommended.</li>
      <li>Ok, product works great, &amp; I normally do not rant about anything other than the product in A review.</li>
      <li>I use listerine from 2 to 3 times daily, so I go through a lot of it, but it works great, and if you gargle it, it will kill bacteria and germs in the back of your mouth</li>
      <li>I have been using this stuff for years - ever since it first came out.  </li>
      <li>Everything else has changed: the razors we use, the goofy shaving gels and deoderants - but one thing remains constant in my bathroom cabinet:  </li>
      <li>What more can be said about Listerine, everyone has a different pain thresh hold.</li>
      <li>Remember the commercials when this first debuted?  </li>
      <li>The taste is not too harsh and I do feel it is a good antiseptic to use as mouthwash.</li>
      <li>, fast forward a bit, and we have many different kinds to choose from.  </li>
      <li>Aside from being my preferred pre-wash mouth rinse, I really feel like Listerine helps me stay healthier.</li>
      <li>However it is occurring to me that Amazon (and/or its vendors) has really started gouging customers on prices.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s face none of really like brushing, flossing, and washing our mouths out afterwards.  </li>
      <li>At a local mass retailer, they have a 1.5 liter bottle of Cool Mint Listerine for $5.72...regular price.  </li>
      <li>good quality mouthwash (fresh taste), but it is quite expensive and you&#x27;re probably better off getting third-party brand mouthwash for half the price.</li>
      <li>highly recommended</li>
      <li>Listerine Antiseptic not only helps keep your breath fresh but kills bacteria that can cause tooth decay.</li>
      <li>This is going too be short but sweet only because my generation grew up on Listerine peoducts, knowing well, the evident curative and thorough effects therein.</li>
      <li>I found this exact same bottle of mouthwash in the exact same size for 5.29 at my local drugstore!</li>
      <li>Is anybody surprised?  </li>
      <li>My water is naturally fluoridated, so I just use the antiseptic one (gingivitis protection).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I dread the practice, but lately I have resigned myself to it in pursuit of better oral health.  </li>
      <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t taste horrible like the original  Listerine, much improved product.</li>
      <li>I have like 1 single tiny cavity that was filled in way back before I used Listerine.  </li>
      <li>Overall I highly recommend this mouthwash.</li>
      <li>It appears the product is no longer an Amazon subscribe and save product, and unless it is when I need a new bottle (every month), I will just get it elsewhere, or purchase a different brand.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Your mouth just plain feels and smells dentist fresh after you use it.</li>
      <li>It is well worth it to me to pay $1 or a little more to avoid all the trouble of getting to the store, getting a cart, going up and down the lanes, going through check-out, packing the car and going back home.  </li>

<li> While Listerine is a great product, this price is HORRIBLE.  </li>
<li> Product was intact and was what was expected.  </li>

<li> I will have to try the other flavors soon.</li>
<li> It took a week for it to get to me via UPS from KY, and shipped via ground due to the ORM-D hazmat label.</li>
<li> So with a little habit changing, I&#x27;ve made Listerine part of my hygiene regiment</li>
<li> I tend to add a little bit to my water reservoir in the Waterpik.</li>
<li> Its missing tartar prevention.</li>
<li> there is no need for alcohol in mouthwash   and it leaves a funny after taste which is bad.    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great stuff - works as promised - great taste.  Of course it&#x27;s more expensive to shop on-line.  Is anybody surprised?  It is well worth it to me to pay $1 or a little more to avoid all the trouble of getting to the store, getting a cart, going up and down the lanes, going through check-out, packing the car and going back home.  Out of mouthwash?  Sit, click and send.  I love it!</li>
    <li> What can I say, it is the best out there. It arrived on time as promised. Very pleased. Been around for years for a reason. Best we can buy.</li>
    <li> What more can be said about Listerine, everyone has a different pain thresh hold. Listerine is powerful, I enjoy the Cool mint flavor. I tend to add a little bit to my water reservoir in the Waterpik. My dentist does not fuss me out about my gums so hey it works for me.</li>
    <li> Costco has a better price. It is even cheaper combined with costco coupon.&lt;br /&gt;But the product itself works great for me.</li>
    <li> This is an antiseptic mouthwash WITHOUT fluoride. You can&#x27;t have both alcohol and fluoride (alcohol makes fluoride ineffective), so you need to just pick one or the other. My water is naturally fluoridated, so I just use the antiseptic one (gingivitis protection).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is nice because using this twice a day keeps all plaque off your teeth. If you floss and brush thoroughly (including your tongue) before you sleep (using the mouthwash, of course), you should wake up without any bad breath. If I forget or am too lazy to brush, I immediately regret it upon waking up. The 5 minutes you spend flossing, brushing, and swishing is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this is alcohol based, it burns. You&#x27;ll get used to it. Don&#x27;t dilute it with water (or rinse afterwards), as that will decrease its effectiveness. If you don&#x27;t want dry mouth, spit out as much of it as possible. Also, don&#x27;t let it get on your lips; that will cause dry and chapped lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it shipped via Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save for $3.74. It took a week for it to get to me via UPS from KY, and shipped via ground due to the ORM-D hazmat label. It appears the product is no longer an Amazon subscribe and save product, and unless it is when I need a new bottle (every month), I will just get it elsewhere, or purchase a different brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it is great, as long as you use it as directed.</li>
    <li> I use the Listerine Antiseptic Mouthwash, Cool Mint, 33.8-Ounce for a multitude of uses including washing out my mouth in the morning, before bed, before kissing my significant other, and after eating food that can make my breath smell bad.  After gargling with Listerine, my mouth smells kissably good according to my partner.</li>
    <li> I want you to know how much I love this stuff.  Listerine.  It&#x27;s one of those brands that your Dad used to use that is still around the house to this day.  Everything else has changed: the razors we use, the goofy shaving gels and deoderants - but one thing remains constant in my bathroom cabinet:  Listerine!&lt;br /&gt;My old man used to use the original kind - came in a glass bottle - stung like battery acid.  Remember that stuff?  I thought it was just great when I was a kid, even when it hurt like hell.&lt;br /&gt;Well, fast forward a bit, and we have many different kinds to choose from.  And of all the ones out there, Cool Mint dominates them all!!  It&#x27;s flavor is more COOL then MINT - it&#x27;s refreshing without being overly minty.  I have been using this stuff for years - ever since it first came out.  Remember the commercials when this first debuted?  It showed a CGI Listerine bottle swinging through the jungle with that catchy late-80s tune playing?  I forget the song.  But I&#x27;ll never forget my Cool Mint Listerine!  I use it every morning, then again just before bed after I brush.  And as a show of how well it works:  I have like 1 single tiny cavity that was filled in way back before I used Listerine.  It&#x27;s the only cavity I&#x27;ve ever had.  I believe being a dedicated user of Listerine has helped my oral hygine tremendously!!!  I&#x27;ll never leave you, Cool Mint Listerine!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have always used Listerine for most of my life. Listerine Antiseptic not only helps keep your breath fresh but kills bacteria that can cause tooth decay. For that &amp;#34;kissable&amp;#34; fresh breath and healthy mouth I trust Listerine.</li>
    <li> Product was intact and was what was expected.  The price is fair and not a bargain but it was something I needed quick without going to the market.  There were no problem whatsoever and will buy again.  You got to love the shipping at your doorstep when you do not want to venture out to the parking lots and lines.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face none of really like brushing, flossing, and washing our mouths out afterwards.  I dread the practice, but lately I have resigned myself to it in pursuit of better oral health.  Not that I suffer from cavities or any other oral disease save the dreaded plaque build-up, which I hate.  So I decide that brushing is not enough and have started using mouth wash more and more.  We have tried all manner of mouthwashes and always come back to \\&quot;Listerine Antiseptic Mouthwash\\&quot; because it&#x27;s the best.  Yes, it cost a little more, but then again the best products usually do, and my teeth are worth it!</li>
    <li> okay first of all i used this product for 3 weeks... 2-3 times a day    my dentist recommended me this toothpaste to help me reduce gingivitis... so far i have not noticed a single reduction in that     worse yet it even helped the production of tartar on my teeth which my dentist also noticed.. i have a good oral hygiene habbit and i do brush my teeth 2 or 3 times a day to fight off plaque and cavities.    this mouthwash is a hard abrasive.. it has alcohol which burns my mouth.. there is no need for alcohol in mouthwash   and it leaves a funny after taste which is bad.    i dont know why parents would allow their kids to rinse their mouths with a cancer causing agent   oh its true alcohol in mouthwash is cancer productive, and by that i mean it can cause mouth cancer...    we drink alcohol we dont swish it around for 30 seconds or upto a minute.. its totally different than drinking</li>
    <li> Like Listerine over other products. The taste is not too harsh and I do feel it is a good antiseptic to use as mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Listerine is the best product i know of that can do it all.You know after a good brush the icing on the cake is some good ol Listerine.And With this particular Listerine your&#x27;e good for 24 hours,now how great is that.</li>
    <li> I know I have a clean mouth when I am done, I just can&#x27;t taste anything for a few hours after ;)  Good product, dentist recommended.</li>
    <li> Its missing tartar prevention. I bought different flavor before which actually had it in. The taste is tolerable. Look for artic mint as alternative.</li>
    <li> Man, I remember back in college I had this 33.8 ounce bottle of Listerine with me in the dorms and this fat girl laughed at me. Man, I was sad. But you know what, she is still fat and I am skinny and good looking. I might have bad breath but with Listerine by my side at all times, I don&#x27;t have to worry.</li>
    <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t taste horrible like the original  Listerine, much improved product. I will have to try the other flavors soon.</li>
    <li> My taste buds must have changed. The Listerine Antiseptic mouthwash had a taste that was okay to good, nothing like the previous taste that I had remembered without found memories. I found that as a standard mouthwash it was as good as it got.</li>
    <li> I use this product to brush my teeth (or simply rinse my mouth), often several times a day. I never use dentifrice. I rarely use floss. This has been my habit for several decades. I am now in my 6th decade and I have excellent dental health. I have never had a dental carie and my gums are in good condition. I have tried different Listerine flavors and they are all acceptable but I tend to gravitate to Cool Mint, which I guess is the most popular flavor.</li>
    <li> Bought to use as a callous remover (with vinegar). And it turned my nails blue!  Sooooo not a good idea. And it didn&#x27;t work. Great as a mouthwash tho!!</li>
    <li> While Listerine is a great product, this price is HORRIBLE.  At a local mass retailer, they have a 1.5 liter bottle of Cool Mint Listerine for $5.72...regular price.  Amazon&#x27;s Subscibe &amp; Save price for 33.8 oz. is $6.67, and regularly $7.85.  The single bottle I received came in a ridiculously long box that could have held a fishing pole.</li>
    <li> I use listerine from 2 to 3 times daily, so I go through a lot of it, but it works great, and if you gargle it, it will kill bacteria and germs in the back of your mouth</li>
    <li> perfect for having fresh breath and a perfect mouth antiseptic.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is easily the best mouthwash I have ever used. The taste is great, and the mouthwash leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh. I use it morning and night which is basically my routine and I like to stick to it. Overall I highly recommend this mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Aside from being my preferred pre-wash mouth rinse, I really feel like Listerine helps me stay healthier. I once heard that a majority of the germs a person comes in contact with throughout the day enter through the mouth and most of them incubate and spread from the throat. So with a little habit changing, I&#x27;ve made Listerine part of my hygiene regiment and I never get sick.</li>
    <li> This is going too be short but sweet only because my generation grew up on Listerine peoducts, knowing well, the evident curative and thorough effects therein. I even feel somewhat puerile recommended a product that this so ingrained in our youth as baby Boomers and a nod that we will always pass on to our kids. Oral health is tantamount to longevity and even getting a job.I say,maybe you are paying more for Listerine mouth wash but do it, it is important that you get the best care for your teeth and gums. Additionally, the product is well known for mitigating that unacceptable social consequent, the embarrassment of bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jay Adler Music Critic.</li>
    <li> The best oral rinse on the market today, period. Your mouth just plain feels and smells dentist fresh after you use it.</li>
    <li> great for daily use, everything as explained on the label. i&#x27;d buy a larger size because this one wouldn&#x27;t last very long. highly recommended</li>
    <li> good quality mouthwash (fresh taste), but it is quite expensive and you&#x27;re probably better off getting third-party brand mouthwash for half the price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember why I ordered listerine instead of getting it from a store, and I don&#x27;t care. It was minty and refreshing. Listerine is the best.</li>
    <li> Ok, product works great, &amp; I normally do not rant about anything other than the product in A review. However it is occurring to me that Amazon (and/or its vendors) has really started gouging customers on prices. They used to be my go to store, now I find myself looking elsewhere to find better pricing. And I&#x27;m finding it! I found this exact same bottle of mouthwash in the exact same size for 5.29 at my local drugstore! Some people may not care, and would see that extra costs as a convenience factor for not having to drive to the store to pick it up, but if you are looking for the best price, then keep looking.</li>
