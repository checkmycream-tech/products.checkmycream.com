### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Taste and texture are awesome!</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product.</li>
      <li>I have look for 10 years for the perfect lip exfoliator.</li>
      <li>They r excellent together....</li>
      <li>This is wonderful, and leaves a minty flavor.</li>
      <li>Great company to buy from.</li>
      <li>Great customer service.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great.</li>
      <li>Great lip exfoliator, even feels like it plumbs my lips.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
      <li>Great product 👍 👍 👍 👍</li>
      <li>good stuff, works well.</li>
      <li>Good product...</li>
      <li>This product tastes good, too, but don&#x27;t eat it.</li>
      <li>Thought it would have a bit more oil in it, but it is still really nice.  </li>
      <li>Best lip scrub i&#x27;ve used so far...</li>
      <li>My husband says my lips feel even more kissable now.  :0)</li>
      <li>the best product i have ever used only lips.</li>
      <li>Perhaps introducing more of an oil would help?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found the company&#x27;s products actually do what they promise with quality ingredients, which is awesome!</li>
      <li>Loved it at first, but it dries out a bit.</li>
      <li>I stopped using it after a couple of times because I just couldn&#x27;t get over how strong the taste in my mouth was every time.  </li>
      <li>My lips feel fabulous</li>
      <li>This exfoliator will make your lips super smooth and SO kissable.</li>
      <li>This is a perfectly fine substitute, also has a nice sweet taste, and you get much more product for something like half the price.</li>
      <li>Made a HUGE did in my lips on first use.  </li>
      <li>(yes, I know it&#x27;s sugar, which is kind of crumbly in texture), but I use body sugar scrubs daily</li>
      <li>So worth it</li>
      <li>I used to use Fresh brown sugar lip scrub</li>
      <li>First of all, I think the sugar granules are huge, they feel like the kind of sugar crystals you&#x27;d sprinkle on a cupcake; kind of large for a delicate area like the lips</li>
      <li>I hated to rate this product a 3-star because it seems like a good company, but there are two things I wish they would fix (in my opinion), and I would more than happy to change my rating.  </li>
      <li>Does exactly what it claims.</li>
      <li>I find wetting my hands and face first helps with that.</li>
      <li>My lips end up even more dry than before &amp; they remain chapped.</li>
      <li>U don&#x27;t need much ...</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>I chose this brand because the ingredients seemed natural and the price was right.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have a problem with them crumbling and falling off my body; however, they usually contain shea butter or some kind of oil that keeps the product together.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m always trying new stuff...</li>
      <li>I live an organic lifestyle</li>
      <li>If you are new to lip-scrubbing, you may find the texture off-putting.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several lip scrubs and this one takes the cake - my lips are soft and conditioned especially when followed up with their lip balm (which you get as a free prize in every order).</li>
      <li>Just a word of caution, sugar scrubbing daily was a bit much for my lips</li>
      <li>Secondly, it has a very crumbly texture</li>
      <li>the positive side, I feel like my lips are smoother than before I became hooked on lip-scrubbing, and they feel full and pouty (at least temporarily) afterwards.  </li>
      <li>This has really helped heal my dry, chapped lips.</li>
      <li>The only con is that it&#x27;s not quite sticky enough, so it&#x27;s hard to make sure some of it actually makes it to your lips rather than just falling off your finger.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product, especially if you experience dry chapped lips.</li>

<li> My lips have been getting  pretty chapped lately, resulting in them peeling afterwards.</li>
<li> The exfoliant had wet the sticker from within to the point it looked used and open.</li>

<li> I never really noticed a difference on my lips when I used it.</li>
<li> I bought this based on other reviews but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>

<li> nothing wrong with enhancing. ; )</li>
<li> so i was a little weary</li>
<li> Natural alternative to the SUGAR brand, and less expensive.</li>
<li> I have since gotten used to it, but if you are someone with really sensitive, chapped lips, you may find this uncomfortable.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s too hard on my lips as well.  </li>
<li> This came in very bad shape.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Loved it at first, but it dries out a bit. Maybe all of the oil seeps to the bottom???</li>
    <li> This came in very bad shape. The exfoliant had wet the sticker from within to the point it looked used and open. I bought it as a gift and couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Great lip exfoliator, even feels like it plumbs my lips.</li>
    <li> This product is way to minty for my taste.  It&#x27;s too hard on my lips as well.  I stopped using it after a couple of times because I just couldn&#x27;t get over how strong the taste in my mouth was every time.  I never really noticed a difference on my lips when I used it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Natural alternative to the SUGAR brand, and less expensive. My lips feel fabulous</li>
    <li> the best product i have ever used only lips.So worth it</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  Thought it would have a bit more oil in it, but it is still really nice.  This company even added a lip balm! My husband says my lips feel even more kissable now.  :0)</li>
    <li> good stuff, works well.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on other reviews but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. My lips end up even more dry than before &amp; they remain chapped. I guess I&#x27;m still on the hunt for a lip exfoliator.</li>
    <li> This exfoliator will make your lips super smooth and SO kissable. I highly recommend this product, especially if you experience dry chapped lips. I&#x27;ve never had that problem but I&#x27;m always trying new stuff...nothing wrong with enhancing. ; )</li>
    <li> I hated to rate this product a 3-star because it seems like a good company, but there are two things I wish they would fix (in my opinion), and I would more than happy to change my rating.  First of all, I think the sugar granules are huge, they feel like the kind of sugar crystals you&#x27;d sprinkle on a cupcake; kind of large for a delicate area like the lips and they do not dissolve any time soon.  If you are new to lip-scrubbing, you may find the texture off-putting.  I have since gotten used to it, but if you are someone with really sensitive, chapped lips, you may find this uncomfortable.  Secondly, it has a very crumbly texture (yes, I know it&#x27;s sugar, which is kind of crumbly in texture), but I use body sugar scrubs daily and I don&#x27;t have a problem with them crumbling and falling off my body; however, they usually contain shea butter or some kind of oil that keeps the product together.  Perhaps introducing more of an oil would help?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, I feel like my lips are smoother than before I became hooked on lip-scrubbing, and they feel full and pouty (at least temporarily) afterwards.  I chose this brand because the ingredients seemed natural and the price was right.  Just a word of caution, sugar scrubbing daily was a bit much for my lips and I felt like I was drying them out by over-doing it.  I now scrub every other day without a problem.</li>
    <li> I have look for 10 years for the perfect lip exfoliator. I live an organic lifestyle so I pay close attention to ingredients. This product tastes good, too, but don&#x27;t eat it.</li>
    <li> Best lip scrub i&#x27;ve used so far... Generous size too... U don&#x27;t need much ... It&#x27;s gritty i wasn&#x27;t used to that so i was a little weary but it did the job... I&#x27;m happy with it and i&#x27;d purchase it again.... I followed it with their lip balm... They r excellent together.... Good product...</li>
    <li> This is wonderful, and leaves a minty flavor.</li>
    <li> My lips have been getting  pretty chapped lately, resulting in them peeling afterwards. This scrub helped take off all the peeling skin to my delight XD it works so well. They even sent me their lipbalm no charge ^^ I have already recommended it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Made a HUGE did in my lips on first use.  Will definitely keep this product around!!</li>
    <li> Taste and texture are awesome!

    <li> have not ordered it yet</li>
    <li> Great product 👍 👍 👍 👍</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I like everything I have tried. Does exactly what it claims. Great customer service. Will order with no worries. My hubby loves their products as well. Great company to buy from.</li>
    <li> It exfoliates well, but  too much can be irritating to your lips.</li>
