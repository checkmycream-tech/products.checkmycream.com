      <li>I use this supply anytime i travel out of the shop for clients, its pretty good, easy to tune and compact to save space.</li>

      <li>Going to buy a replacement transformer to switch it out, it&#x27;s an easy fix so no biggie.</li>
      <li>this is a great back up power supply good to have n case ur other one would break but would work good as primary</li>
      <li>works,  but makes a humming sound when plugged in?...  </li>
      <li>The light indicated the device was receiving power</li>
      <li>at a great price definite must have</li>
      <li>Delivery time was good but the power supply quit working during first five minutes of its first tattoo.</li>
      <li>but after tryin it out for the first time i was extremely satisfied.</li>
      <li>but as for now i am pretty satisfied with this order.</li>
      <li>THIS IS CLEAN</li>
      <li>Runs full blast no matter the setting it is set on.</li>
      <li>Cool compact power supply.</li>
      <li>, so you buy it, everything they make&#x27;s not bad, so I&#x27;m looking forward to get my mini power box, its paid for and being shipped, and I can&#x27;t wait to try it,</li>
      <li>the power cord is strong &amp; is pretty long.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Very small and does a great job!</li>
      <li>Works peeeerrfectly , even shaded fine without much adjustment.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s light weight very realiable also..</li>
      <li>10/10 Mini&#x27;s are always fun to use</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t overheat, and is a nice size for travel kits or limited space tattooing.</li>
      <li>i fixed it and it has been fine since.</li>
      <li>Good little machine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tested it out and the box is hot as a fire cracker on forth of July</li>
      <li>Love it totally recommend.</li>
      <li>Junk, pure junk.</li>
      <li>Finally hooked the circuit up to a .5A, 12V power supply which works fine.  </li>
      <li>I also wish it had a digital read out or power marks to know how much power is being supplied rather by having to tune machines based off of sound.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I really like the size of this power supply and it has been reliable....</li>
      <li>Very portable.</li>
      <li>problem is the power cord does really hold its place in the unit.</li>
      <li>it holds its power steady and very stable, in fact, I got anther one in my cart</li>
      <li>, I love it so far it is powerful little power supply</li>
      <li>Runs smooth during long sessions.</li>
      <li>Looks really cool, plugged it in and it doesn&#x27;t work on a regular machine, however if you plug the jacks in - incorrectly some juice flows, I would use this to tattoo on anyone, I will never order from this company again.  </li>
      <li>I bought this as a back up or travel supply but it works better than my old one, ( got rid of my old one because of this).</li>
      <li>,IT DOESNT GET HOT AND ITS PRETTY STRONG FOR HOW SMALL IT</li>
      <li>I finally caught these little power supplies on sale, and they got good rating, even if they are made in china,</li>
      <li>and I bought a second one as a back up :)</li>
      <li>, that will make around six boxes got ,but I;m using this one for my main power supply .</li>
      <li>Now its my main</li>
      <li>The color is a beautiful metallic royal blue, and it&#x27;s just a little bigger than a pack of cigarettes.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product, lightweight, performs as expected.</li>
      <li>I love this, it&#x27;s small an very portable and packs a lot if power it makes tattooing on the go a breeze</li>
      <li>i love how small it is.</li>
      <li>I work on large scale tattoos on a daily basis and use this.</li>
      <li>lol crazy rick</li>
      <li>but it has outperformed damn near everything else i&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
      <li>, so far and I will let you no how it will take and every day use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Got this to replace one I had and so far it&#x27;s doing what it should.</li>
      <li>We use this power supply on our personal tattoo gun and it works very well for our needs.</li>
      <li>was a whole lot smaller than anticipated but still works.</li>
      <li>Simple to set up: left for the tattoo gun and right for the foot petal.</li>
      <li>I would say if you want a small easily portable power supply get this</li>
      <li>it is more than capable and has lasted longer then the more expensive brands I have purchased in the past.</li>
      <li>it had a couple of scratches but nothing to noticeable.its so small it could fit in the palm of my hand, even pockets.</li>
      <li>as of now i would deff recommend to anyone trying to take up less space and might possibly be on the go as much as i am!!!</li>
      <li>I cannot believe how steady the power holds, the unit doesn&#x27;t heat up even after hours of use, and works better than the expensive guys.  </li>
      <li>My old digital power supply burn up</li>
      <li>it half the time because its consistent and convenient.</li>
      <li>Plugging the power supply in for the first time there was a high pitched noise, which usually indicates that there maybe a short.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a good power supply for the price. It had lasted longer than all the other products I&#x27;ve bought. Very portable. I&#x27;ve even dropped it a few times yet it still works. Had this product for over a year.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once but it ran pretty good, so far so good.</li>
    <li> got this little guy as a backup but i actually us it half the time because its consistent and convenient. very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> works,  but makes a humming sound when plugged in?...  dont sount too good.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a back up or travel supply but it works better than my old one, ( got rid of my old one because of this). I&#x27;ve ran this for 6 hours strait with no problems, I know their are bad reviews about this power supply but I say their wrong this thing is awsome</li>
    <li> Runs full blast no matter the setting it is set on. Thumbs down</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let this lil guy fool you it is more than capable and has lasted longer then the more expensive brands I have purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> It provides nice power to a shader and liner but it makes this buzzing noise inside the power supply.  Not sure of longevity, but it does work overseas.  Make sure you buy a cord though, as this did NOT come with a converter like it said it did at my time of purchase.</li>
    <li> Actual product had no voltage indicator as pictured.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t burned out yet.</li>
    <li> very good and good device</li>
    <li> My old digital power supply burn up so I ordered this one! Very small and does a great job! Easy to store with the rest of my supplies! Cost was great! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It was horrible, I wasted my money about I honestly want a refund. It stopped working in one day</li>
    <li> Sorry for previous review , I was unaware of the functions with the minibox. Works peeeerrfectly , even shaded fine without much adjustment.</li>
    <li> Shorted out as soon as it was plugged in</li>
    <li> Fir it being a small travel box for tattooing it holds up very strong it&#x27;s light weight very realiable also..at a great price definite must have</li>
    <li> Got this to replace one I had and so far it&#x27;s doing what it should. Glad I made this purchase. For the price and quick delivery I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> Looks really cool, plugged it in and it doesn&#x27;t work on a regular machine, however if you plug the jacks in - incorrectly some juice flows, I would use this to tattoo on anyone, I will never order from this company again.  Junk, pure junk.</li>
    <li> It was actually a nice little supply, worked great for about 2 months then crapped out, good for emergency uses, you get what you pay for.:b</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, lightweight, performs as expected. Power cord could be longer. Inputs for clipcord and pedal make set up easy.</li>
    <li> We use this power supply on our personal tattoo gun and it works very well for our needs.</li>
    <li> This definitely does the job especially for its price. Its not a Kingpin power supply, but it puts out a constant power source and its reliable. I work on large scale tattoos on a daily basis and use this.</li>
    <li> The best power supply i ever used.. I bring it everywhere along with my tattoo machine and my inks..Fits perfect in my hand made travel case.....</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome. I bought it as a backup but it has outperformed damn near everything else i&#x27;ve ever owned. Now its my main and I bought a second one as a back up :)</li>
    <li> Runs smooth during long sessions. Doesn&#x27;t overheat, and is a nice size for travel kits or limited space tattooing. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Its small, but it definatly got the job done, altho i only used it one time i seen no problem. O and delivery was faster than i thought :)</li>
    <li> In fairness, I did not use this for tattoo gear, I used it to power a homemade foam cutting table.  I had the circuit correct but this device was not pushing the power it advertises.  Hooked it up to a power meter but it just didn&#x27;t register, with or without the resistance wire.  The light indicated the device was receiving power but I just couldn&#x27;t get it to work.  Finally hooked the circuit up to a .5A, 12V power supply which works fine.  It&#x27;s a shame it didn&#x27;t work out because I like everything about the design of this product, other than the fact that it did not supply power.</li>
    <li> I love this, it&#x27;s small an very portable and packs a lot if power it makes tattooing on the go a breeze</li>
    <li> I really like the size of this power supply and it has been reliable....but, as soon as i got it I went to put the power cord in it and it pushed the outlet into the unit. I unscrewed it and it seemed to have been unsecured in side the unit! i fixed it and it has been fine since. It also is not very well designed internally. stuff was just kinda scattered and unsecure in it!</li>
    <li> It works but the plugs are kind of cheap, great for a mobile scratcher looking to keep cost low, plenty of power to run a machine.</li>
    <li> Good power supply for traveling. I had this for a little over a year and its still kicking. I use this supply anytime i travel out of the shop for clients, its pretty good, easy to tune and compact to save space. I only wish there was some rubber feet under it to keep it from moving around on whatever surface u have it on. I also wish it had a digital read out or power marks to know how much power is being supplied rather by having to tune machines based off of sound.</li>
    <li> Cool compact power supply. I use this little guy when I travel. Makes a weird whining sound when plugged in so I dont suggest everyday use.</li>
    <li> This product is exceptional for its mini size. was skeptical wen i got it but after tryin it out for the first time i was extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Perfect! 10/10 Mini&#x27;s are always fun to use</li>
    <li> The color is a beautiful metallic royal blue, and it&#x27;s just a little bigger than a pack of cigarettes. Simple to set up: left for the tattoo gun and right for the foot petal. Plugging the power supply in for the first time there was a high pitched noise, which usually indicates that there maybe a short. Not too long after it stopped working. After opening up the casing, found out the transformer blew. Going to buy a replacement transformer to switch it out, it&#x27;s an easy fix so no biggie. Still like it</li>
    <li> I finally caught these little power supplies on sale, and they got good rating, even if they are made in china, like I said in one of my reviews around 80% of tattoo supplies and parts are from china, so what the hell if you want anything you are going to get it from there or do without, so you buy it, everything they make&#x27;s not bad, so I&#x27;m looking forward to get my mini power box, its paid for and being shipped, and I can&#x27;t wait to try it, well I got my box In three days, a world record shipping. I&#x27;ve tested it out and the box is hot as a fire cracker on forth of July, I love it so far it is powerful little power supply it holds its power steady and very stable, in fact, I got anther one in my cart, that will make around six boxes got ,but I;m using this one for my main power supply . I &#x27;m very impressed with this buy, so far and I will let you no how it will take and every day use.&lt;br /&gt;p.s. a little trick is to take some sturdy grommets nipples and crazy glue, and glue four of the on the bottom of the box and then it want slide around on you, and works good. lol crazy rick</li>
    <li> THIS IS CLEAN IT FITS IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND,IT DOESNT GET HOT AND ITS PRETTY STRONG FOR HOW SMALL IT IS.IT GOES RITE IN YOUR POCKET.ITS NICE WHEN UR ON THE GO.</li>
    <li> Delivery time was good but the power supply quit working during first five minutes of its first tattoo. ... I will never buy again</li>
    <li> Great price. Good little machine. Has worked so far.&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is the power cord does really hold its place in the unit. Has fallen out several times.&lt;br /&gt;Good for a back up unit.</li>
    <li> It died after five minutes of use. Total garbage.</li>
    <li> just received this mini tattoo power supply today!. was a little late on the delivery but very much worth the wait, its small very well built and i plugged in a few of my machines and it powered them up just as well if not better than a few of my larger and more reliable power supplys it also takes up not even a quarter of the space!!! i cant wait to get going and see how it holds up. as of now i would deff recommend to anyone trying to take up less space and might possibly be on the go as much as i am!!!</li>
    <li> this thing broke on me, then the dude asked if this thing works good with rotarys and it doent beacause this is what im working with. i simply hooked everything up let it run alone for no more then two minute, and i believe it shorted but im not smelling anything burned. so i dont know what it could be please help....</li>
    <li> Works really good. Love it totally recommend. Good size. Came on time as said. 5 stars for everything ex: quality, size, power, etc</li>
    <li> i love how small it is. i got it faster than expected. how ever when its on it make o high pitched squeal not sure if its going to blow up or not and i can see where it has been tore apart before. it dose push out the power thowe thats for sue not to bad at all for 5 bucks</li>
    <li> This  sucks I swear I had it plugged up for not even ten mins then it stopped working . Spend more money and get better quality .</li>
    <li> Works great absolutely fell in love with it so light weight and portable best power supply I have ever owned  this power supply is an absolutely amazing product a must buy for tattoo artist every where</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how steady the power holds, the unit doesn&#x27;t heat up even after hours of use, and works better than the expensive guys.  I bought 2 more for backups.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this buy did take some time to get but got here before they said it would as the size is freaking awesome its tinny but still puts out the power you need to get the job done</li>
    <li> this is a great back up power supply good to have n case ur other one would break but would work good as primary but i prefer digital</li>
    <li> It keeps going and going and going and going.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it needs no foot pedal. Just hook in, turn on and INK!</li>
    <li> great for when i had to go do a tattoo</li>
    <li> Delivery time was 3 days &amp; the packaging was almost unharmed.. the product itself was in good shape. the color is beautiful! it had a couple of scratches but nothing to noticeable.its so small it could fit in the palm of my hand, even pockets. however in the picture it shows that there are numbers around the nob. the actual product only has a line that goes from thin to thick. I was looking forward to the numbers but that&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that i didn&#x27;t like. the power cord is strong &amp; is pretty long.&lt;br /&gt;I have NOT used this product yet but as for now i am pretty satisfied with this order.</li>
    <li> was a whole lot smaller than anticipated but still works. I would say if you want a small easily portable power supply get this</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these, and like the dummy i am, didn&#x27;t read that these do NOT come with clip cord or pedal like almost every other power supply does, just a power cord and unit. It&#x27;s more cost effective to buy unit with everything, after paying separate shipping.</li>
