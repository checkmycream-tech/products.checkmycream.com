      <li>Also good for your scalp and helps to heal and fade scars.</li>
      <li>I have bought this Mosquito Rose oil before from Aubrey and have always gotten great results.  </li>

      <li>Love this oil!</li>
      <li>and it still works amazing on me.</li>
      <li>And the product itself is amazing.</li>
      <li>It might work for stretch marks, which  are kind of scars.    </li>
      <li>and then I pump 2 pumps and warm in between my palms and then press it into my skin.</li>
      <li>But they don&#x27;t come in a handy roll on applicator.     </li>
      <li>(I am fair skinned so it made me look more awake and</li>
      <li>I got it from Whole Foods to use on my face at night to take away inflammation and make my skin flawless overnight.</li>
      <li>I always use this after my rose water toner, and under my makeup primer and foundation.</li>
      <li>Just use under-eye cream (Aubrey&#x27;s Lummessence is recommended) &amp; rose hip seed oil over that.</li>
      <li>it hydrates my skin and absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel great.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, this is a lovely product.  </li>
      <li>My skin is plump and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>To not deal with the hassle of finding credible online resellers, and to support our own home grown brand, I elected to try out the Aubrey brand instead.  </li>
      <li>I love the oil though</li>
      <li>In combination with aloe, what more could a girl need?</li>
      <li>This stuff heals my skin better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>This product has a rollerball top to it, so if you are expecting to use a dropper with it (as was I), you will have to try to remove the top.  </li>
      <li>, I love it for the glow and softness alone</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Bought this at a store (glad to see it on Amazon when it&#x27;s time to reorder).  </li>
      <li>It also makes my complexion look better.  </li>
      <li>bone(which most people forget dose need to be treated) and between my eyes.   </li>
      <li>If your scar is brand new, then this stuff is great.</li>
      <li>I truly never thought it was possible to have smooth under-eye skin without surgery or perfect genes.</li>
      <li>This is cheap, and works okay, but there are definitely better ones out there.</li>
      <li>And I would rather pay a little more and feel confident I got the best product.</li>
      <li>Wow, what a great product.</li>
      <li>First, let me say that I am a huge fan of rose hip oil.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and is not greasy</li>
      <li>I have light skin so EVERYTHING shows up.</li>
      <li>Came on time, was very useful in clearing sunburn rash</li>
      <li>Originally purchased at the health food store but amazon is cheaper.</li>
      <li>even when I smile!</li>
      <li>i originally purchased to help heal a scar under my eye</li>
      <li>Rose Hip Seed oil was recommended in my favorite Woman&#x27;s magazine for reduction of visual scarring</li>
      <li>This product is so good and like the same that in the amazon page.</li>
      <li>I have purchased two more bottles, one for my Sister who is recoving from Carpel Tunnel syndrome and wants to reduce the visibility of the scar from her surgery.</li>
      <li>actually I have bought it several times for my mother and she is very happy with the results she gets  </li>
      <li>I used this a long time ago and loved the results.  </li>
      <li>how amazing this oil works, m on my second bottle</li>
      <li>I was given a generous 15 ml sample by the Australian Eleusian brand and found it amazing.  </li>
      <li>I had recently bought Aubrey&#x27;s Rosa Mosqueta Rose Hip Seed Oil.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something to get rid of older scars from acne, surgery, or having a rock thrown at your face; go for something more intense like SCARpin.&lt;br /&gt;Also,</li>
      <li>This Aubrey brand is sold in all major health food stores, which gives me more confidence.</li>
      <li>It has been great as usual.  </li>
      <li>after trying a few different oils, this one is the best.</li>
      <li>I use Aubrey&#x27;s Rose Mosqueta dry skincare line.</li>
      <li>Thank very much.  </li>
      <li>The girl at Whole Foods said this was a more reputable brand because they specialize it facial products, but I really think the other brand called \\&quot;Now\\&quot; works much better for skin care.</li>
      <li>I absolutly LOVE it , the only thing i regret is that i didnt take a before and after picture on my scar</li>
      <li>I had gotten one particularly hot weekend</li>
      <li>I put it on my face first thing in the morning, rub it in gently, then wash my face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pure so you won&#x27;t break out.</li>
      <li>The fine lines are invisible and my skin texture is tight and smooth...</li>
      <li>The bottles were packed nice and tight, so that there was no way they could have jostled around.</li>
      <li>The serum absorbs so fast.</li>
      <li>I have not noticed any reasonable difference in reducing scarring but one thing that I did notice was that the wrinkles around my eye area are gone.</li>
      <li>I had a tummy tuck and was given this really pricy cream to apply for healing and scar repair.  </li>
      <li>I did not see much of an improvement on the scar.  </li>
      <li>I have used the whole bottle, no improvement at all.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>But as rose hip oils go, this one is relatively mediocre, especially compared to the higher grade rose hip oils (e.g. kosmea).</li>
      <li>I mainly ordered it for acne scars..</li>
      <li>You can find ten times more rosa mosqueta for the same price on the internet.</li>
      <li>I received quick results (3-4 wks) by following this routine: cleanse, tone, rosehip seed oil, under-eye cream  and then moisturize.</li>
      <li>Because it is high in retinol and vitamin C</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Forget using Mederma or the like, this works faster and makes your skin unbelievably soft!!</li>
      <li>The second thing I noticed was that the eyes area wasn&#x27;t dry and fine lines seem to almost vanish!</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed was the yellow and the ingredients in the oil seems to take away the darkness underneath my eyes!</li>
      <li>I applied this product before go to bed and in the mornings my skin felt so soft and new.</li>
      <li>The smell is strong for some, but it dissipates after a few minutes.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this oil was a great moisturizing tool and what have you, but it only worked on my new scars.</li>
      <li>It combines beautifully with my other products, and it especially smoothes the delicate skin around my eyes.</li>
      <li>There is nothing in the world that has made my lips as soft as this serum.  </li>
      <li>My son, in his early 20&#x27;s, has pockmarks on his cheeks from having had severe cystic acne.</li>
      <li>My skin feels so soft.</li>
      <li>Wow-</li>
      <li>face skin absorbs it and it leaves it soft all day.</li>
      <li>I also had some new scars on my upper lip, and they were gone in about two weeks.</li>
      <li>I use it during winder time when the air is dry and it really helps with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent product. It smoothed my skin and also close my pores. I applied this product before go to bed and in the mornings my skin felt so soft and new.</li>
    <li> First, let me say that I am a huge fan of rose hip oil. But as rose hip oils go, this one is relatively mediocre, especially compared to the higher grade rose hip oils (e.g. kosmea). This is cheap, and works okay, but there are definitely better ones out there.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! I usually buy it directly from Aubrey-Organics, but I found it through this seller for a couple dollars less. I always use this after my rose water toner, and under my makeup primer and foundation. It combines beautifully with my other products, and it especially smoothes the delicate skin around my eyes. I highly recommend. Aubrey-Organics&#x27; Sea Buckthorn Oil is great stuff, too. I usually rotate the two.</li>
    <li> I have been using the oil for two weeks now. I already see an improvement on my skin. I will continue using it. I have been putting it daily for a big scar on my lower stomach.</li>
    <li> Originally purchased at the health food store but amazon is cheaper. I used this religiously every night until I recently ran out. Wow- I never thought it would work better then expensive eye creams. I use it for the little wrinkles starting outside of the eye,underneath my eye from corner to corner,my brow bone(which most people forget dose need to be treated) and between my eyes.   The first thing I noticed was the yellow and the ingredients in the oil seems to take away the darkness underneath my eyes! (I am fair skinned so it made me look more awake and the eye area brighter)   The second thing I noticed was that the eyes area wasn&#x27;t dry and fine lines seem to almost vanish! I had YOUNGER friends comment on the fact I had no wrinkles around my eyes...I am almost 33...not to old.. but defiantly old enough to start seeing lines!  The third thing I noticed is... I had a few broken capillaries and a two tiny old scars from acne. I have light skin so EVERYTHING shows up. I doted I bit on each area and it seem to fade them!   I realize it&#x27;s an oil... it prevents tugging on the eye area like a cream. Took some getting use to. Keep in mind you do need to be careful NOT to get it in your eyes!</li>
    <li> I mainly ordered it for acne scars..its been only a month since I am using the product. I have not noticed any reasonable difference in reducing scarring but one thing that I did notice was that the wrinkles around my eye area are gone. Would recommend it for wrinkles/ under eye area etc.</li>
    <li> I have bought this Mosquito Rose oil before from Aubrey and have always gotten great results.  It works for getting rid of scars after surgery and also helps with those nasty wrinkles that occur with normal aging.</li>
    <li> I\\&quot;ve only been using this oil a couple weeks, so I don&#x27;t know how it will work for the lines above my upper lip. These lines are the reason I bought the product. My skin is definitely softer and the oil has not caused breakouts, which was a concern since my skin is acne-prone. I&#x27;ll be anxious to see how the lines look in another couple of weeks. I love the roll-on applicator!</li>
    <li> I had recently bought Aubrey&#x27;s Rosa Mosqueta Rose Hip Seed Oil. I want to start by saying the delivery time was incredible! And the product itself is amazing. However, when I opened the box, I noticed that all of the bottles (There were 12 in the order) had the caps misaligned and some of the oil had leaked out of five of the bottles in the order. The bottles were packed nice and tight, so that there was no way they could have jostled around. This is very disturbing since I had spent over 162 dollars on the order! I usually buy this product in large quantities in order to last a long time, but seeing that all of the bottles had the caps misaligned almost makes me want to reconsider where I buy in the future.</li>
    <li> I just turned 40 and I&#x27;m seeing signs of it on my face. I use this oil on my dry skin at night. It&#x27;s pure so you won&#x27;t break out. Also good for your scalp and helps to heal and fade scars. Great product with many benefits.</li>
    <li> There is nothing in the world that has made my lips as soft as this serum.  I have chronically dry lips, and chapsticks and balms do nothing after about 10 minutes.  Aubrey&#x27;s Vitamin C serum lasts hours and hours on me.  It also makes my complexion look better.  Now, if Aubrey will FINALLY bring back their VegeCell serum, I&#x27;ll have everything I need in the world.</li>
    <li> I got it from Whole Foods to use on my face at night to take away inflammation and make my skin flawless overnight. This product is good, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Now brand. The girl at Whole Foods said this was a more reputable brand because they specialize it facial products, but I really think the other brand called \\&quot;Now\\&quot; works much better for skin care.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this oil was a great moisturizing tool and what have you, but it only worked on my new scars. I have old scars on my cheek from a bad acne outbreak about a year ago. It didn&#x27;t do anything. I also had some new scars on my upper lip, and they were gone in about two weeks. If your scar is brand new, then this stuff is great. If you&#x27;re looking for something to get rid of older scars from acne, surgery, or having a rock thrown at your face; go for something more intense like SCARpin.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the bottle isn&#x27;t that generous in size and quite expensive.</li>
    <li> I reserved writing a review for this product for 4 weeks b/c I wanted to see how well it worked on facial lines &amp; skin texture. I am 28 years old with a few fines lines around the eyes with uneven texture. This oil has been a-m-a-z-i-n-g! The fine lines are invisible and my skin texture is tight and smooth... even when I smile! I received quick results (3-4 wks) by following this routine: cleanse, tone, rosehip seed oil, under-eye cream  and then moisturize. I use Aubrey&#x27;s Rose Mosqueta dry skincare line. Don&#x27;t put the moisturizer under your eyes. Just use under-eye cream (Aubrey&#x27;s Lummessence is recommended) &amp; rose hip seed oil over that. I truly never thought it was possible to have smooth under-eye skin without surgery or perfect genes. My skin had been this way since I was 18 so literally 10 years have melted off my skin. I just wish I could find a way to get it into my bath water. I highly recommend this product! You will be impressed!</li>
    <li> My pre-teen daughter had a large wound on her arm that was starting to form an ugly scar. Rosa Mosqueta Rose Hip Seed oil was recommended in my favorite Woman&#x27;s magazine for reduction of visual scarring so I ordered it from Amazon.com. &lt;br /&gt;We were elated when after a few weeks of twice daily applications, there is no scar at all! I have purchased two more bottles, one for my Sister who is recoving from Carpel Tunnel syndrome and wants to reduce the visibility of the scar from her surgery. &lt;br /&gt;I am confident that she and you will be as happy with this product as we are! &lt;br /&gt;10/10 and Amazon had a great price.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a great product. This stuff heals my skin better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried. In combination with aloe, what more could a girl need? Forget using Mederma or the like, this works faster and makes your skin unbelievably soft!!</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and it still works amazing on me. I use it as a night time treatment. I just wash my face with a cleansing oil and then I pump 2 pumps and warm in between my palms and then press it into my skin. The serum absorbs so fast. My skin is plump and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> I absolutly LOVE it , the only thing i regret is that i didnt take a before and after picture on my scar so u guys can c how amazing this oil works, m on my second bottle and i use it twice a day with massage on the area. I recommend it 100%.</li>
    <li> actually I have bought it several times for my mother and she is very happy with the results she gets  my girlfriend also used it one time when she got chicken pox and after that no signs where of it</li>
    <li> I had a tummy tuck and was given this really pricy cream to apply for healing and scar repair.  I did not see much of an improvement on the scar.  Then a friend told me to try Rosa Mosqueta.  Wow!  I have used it for two weeks/2x a day and the scar has flatted and lightened in color. I can&#x27;t even believe it!</li>
    <li> after trying a few different oils, this one is the best. it hydrates my skin and absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel great. i originally purchased to help heal a scar under my eye, i can&#x27;t say it helped get rid of the scar since that skin area is so delicate but wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it helped heal scars elsewhere</li>
    <li> I was given a generous 15 ml sample by the Australian Eleusian brand and found it amazing.  In just a week to two, my skin was suppler, lines underneath my eyes are less visible, my laugh lines are less deep, so as the creases next to the corner of my lips; pigmentation on my face also faded dramatically.  To not deal with the hassle of finding credible online resellers, and to support our own home grown brand, I elected to try out the Aubrey brand instead.  However, I have to say I am a little disappointed with the results (as compared with Eleusian).  I have been using Aubrey for a little over a month now but have not seen any obvious improvements in any of the areas that I have mentioned above.  Aubrey is also a little pricier than Eleusian (if I had to pay for the latter).  All in all, I would only recommend it only if &#x27;timing&#x27; is not an issue with you, meaning you don&#x27;t mind taking a (much?) longer time to achieve the results that you are expecting- which is still an unknown to me.  I will continue to use the product and see how it goes.</li>
    <li> sorry! this product did not deliver as i expected. The reviews were good, that&#x27;s why i bought it. what a dissapointment.I have used the whole bottle, no improvement at all.</li>
    <li> I have see this product work on scars of a girl friend, a decade ago. Worked great. Now I bought it for some scars on myself. Expect it to work well for myself too.    You can find ten times more rosa mosqueta for the same price on the internet. But they don&#x27;t come in a handy roll on applicator.     And I would rather pay a little more and feel confident I got the best product. This Aubrey brand is sold in all major health food stores, which gives me more confidence. It lasts at least a month unless you have huge scars.    It might work for stretch marks, which  are kind of scars.    You have to use it for several months.</li>
    <li> This product has a rollerball top to it, so if you are expecting to use a dropper with it (as was I), you will have to try to remove the top.  Otherwise, this is a lovely product.  The bottle is the size of a lipstick.</li>
    <li> My mom recommended this for under the eyes, and I got it despite it being quite expensive for the amount of product. I absolutely love it. I put it on my face first thing in the morning, rub it in gently, then wash my face. The serum moisturizes your face like nothing else, without leaving it greasy at all. I would definitely recommend, especially if you have dry skin like me.</li>
    <li> Thank very much.  This product is so good and like the same that in the amazon page. This came to my door in a good time in very good and save mail.</li>
    <li> Great product and great company but I wish that it came in a bigger size. The product itself is great for scars and stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Bought this at a store (glad to see it on Amazon when it&#x27;s time to reorder).  My son, in his early 20&#x27;s, has pockmarks on his cheeks from having had severe cystic acne. Because it is high in retinol and vitamin C I thought it would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a miracle cure, but has helped make the marks shallower. Goes on smoothly and is not greasy (He has oily skin so that was a concern).</li>
    <li> I use it during winder time when the air is dry and it really helps with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;my face skin absorbs it and it leaves it soft all day.</li>
    <li> Came on time, was very useful in clearing sunburn rash I had gotten one particularly hot weekend it was definitely a life saver!!</li>
    <li> value for money is not quite there with this. I love the oil though, it&#x27;s light and give a subtle glow. it&#x27;s said to help with age spots, wrinkles and scarring, I love it for the glow and softness alone</li>
    <li> I used this a long time ago and loved the results.  I&#x27;ve been experiencing some dryness and order it again.  It has been great as usual.  My skin feels so soft. I&#x27;ve noticed that after a few days of using this product my skin is not as dry and some of my expression  lines looks less noticeable. The smell is strong for some, but it dissipates after a few minutes.  I use it in the morning after washing my face with just water.  Great product.</li>
