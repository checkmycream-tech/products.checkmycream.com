      <li>The package is very beautiful and impressive, and it smells similar to the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Nice Fragance for my MOm :)</li>
      <li>it smells really good mildly scented.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t find it any where it is the generic brand of Kenzo flowers but smells &amp; wears just perfect to me</li>
      <li>I love the box.</li>
      <li>And the box is cute</li>
      <li>but when you try it on it smell like nothing its more alcohol</li>
      <li>I love the way they promoted it.</li>
      <li>I love the scent.</li>
      <li>Glad I got this scent</li>
      <li>I love flowers by Kenzo and if you do too then this is very close to it and at a great price.</li>
      <li>Will buy many more.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of baby powder light scented fresh smelling good:)...</li>
      <li>so if you want to buy this because you like the Flower perfume, i would not recommend it, but if you just like a sweet perfume this could be the one for you!</li>
      <li>I was out and was lucky to find it here on amazon!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know what to do with this huge bottle of stinky stuff ...</li>
      <li>It smells like the cheapest of cheap.  </li>
      <li>This perfume (the original) has been one of my favorites for years</li>
      <li>like 20% perfume of the original one</li>
      <li>I love the scent of this perfume but besides that I got my product quickly and it was very reasonable...</li>
      <li>and I use if for special occasions.</li>
      <li>I definitely will be ordering more!</li>
      <li>All merchandises arrived as expected and  in good conditions.  </li>
      <li>I am very disaspointed about this product i got it really quick</li>
      <li>and I saved lots of money, smells a lot like the real thing!</li>
      <li>i have been using Flower by Kenzo for about 7 years and my friend got this Magic Dreams as a Christmas gift from someone and gave it to me, thinking it was the same perfume that i use.  </li>
      <li>so i try on amazon when i first saw it</li>
      <li>At first spray, I was somewhat reminded of Kenzo Flower</li>
      <li>I found Magic dreams a while back from another online shop</li>
      <li>The bottle looks exactly like Kenzo Flower perfume bottle.</li>
      <li>the smell is soft, powdery and almost the same as the original scent.. :)</li>
      <li>fast shipping.packaging is nice..bought for $13 and free shipping went back today to order another one and</li>
      <li>but then it disintegrated into a very chemical odorous aroma.</li>
      <li>The price is excelent, very affordable.</li>
      <li>If you want to smell good -  this is not a good choice.</li>
      <li>Beautiful packaging and looks  expensive.  </li>
      <li>Like I said if you love flowers by Kenzo then this is the closest option and cheapest and will last you a long time!</li>
      <li>it is much sweeter and less complicated/sophisticated fragrance when compared with the original and for me it just didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>but i was wrong this product it doesnt smell like the original one it comes in the same packege as the real one</li>

    <li> Beautiful packaging and looks  expensive.  I don&#x27;t understand the reviews on the fragrance though.  Does not smell anything like Kenzo.  It smells like the cheapest of cheap.  You get what you pay for, I guess.  If you want impressive packaging,  this is your scent.  If you want to smell good -  this is not a good choice.</li>
    <li> Glad I got this scent it smells really good mildly scented. And the box is cute I love the box. I would recommend this scent!!</li>
    <li> i have been using Flower by Kenzo for about 7 years and my friend got this Magic Dreams as a Christmas gift from someone and gave it to me, thinking it was the same perfume that i use.  Since the bottle looked so similar i didn&#x27;t even read the name of the perfume, just assumed it was kenzo, so i sprayed it and immediately felt that something was wrong.  it is much sweeter and less complicated/sophisticated fragrance when compared with the original and for me it just didn&#x27;t work.  so if you want to buy this because you like the Flower perfume, i would not recommend it, but if you just like a sweet perfume this could be the one for you!</li>
    <li> I love it. I&#x27;m running out of this perfume, so I wont hesitate to ordee another one. The price is excelent, very affordable.</li>
    <li> For me works perfect..!!!&lt;br /&gt; I am so happy..  the smell is soft, powdery and almost the same as the original scent.. :)</li>
