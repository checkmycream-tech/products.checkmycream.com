      <li>This is great lotion.  </li>

      <li>are really nice.</li>
      <li>Nice cream lotion</li>
      <li>I was impressed that it&#x27;s 15% MSM which is the highest ratio of MSM I&#x27;ve found so far in a lotion or cream.</li>
      <li>I have used Trimedica MSM products for many years &amp; trust their purity &amp; effectiveness,</li>
      <li>Its better than a lot of msm lotions because of the purity.</li>
      <li>Love this product, it has become a staple for me.</li>
      <li>tried many prescription drugs and none of them have worked.  </li>
      <li>While I prefer unscented, this lotion is available in Berry Vanilla, Orange Ylang Ylang, Coconut Rose, and Medicinal (Tea Tree Oil).</li>
      <li>I find that this lotion is wonderful for use under makeup, put on a sore muscle, or just dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Trimedica Pure MSM lotion is a good quality product.</li>
      <li>Nice lotion with pure ingredients for legs &amp; arms, but not pain relief.</li>
      <li>It is a light lotion.</li>
      <li>Right around the knee.</li>
      <li>I have some eczema on my right leg.</li>
      <li>The seller is very prompt, it comes quickly.</li>
      <li>I bought powdered MSM to ingest, but much prefer to use the lotion...readily absorbed into the skin with the added bonus of a skin softener.</li>
      <li>This was my first time trying the MSM lotion.</li>
      <li>Seller aside, I do recommed Trimedica Pure MSM Lotion.</li>
      <li>(I live in southern California &amp; wear sandles most of the time)</li>
      <li>Although I received no analgesic benefits from Trimedica Pure MSM Lotion, I find its emollient properties very helpful.  </li>
      <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very grateful to have the MSM Lotion.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much difference.</li>
      <li>I much prefer and recommend [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about 6 months, and I really like it.</li>
      <li>and it did&#x27;t seem to help much.</li>
      <li>Most other MSM brands have 12% MSM in them.</li>
      <li>B001KQ7OIE Sunfood MSM Lotion/Cream, Pure &amp; Natural, 8oz]] which is also available in 32 oz size from various sellers.  </li>
      <li>It used to have it in the older batches that I ordered.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it helps with skin tightening as you lose weight, but I&#x27;&#x27;ll be sure and review again about that in a few months.</li>
      <li>it did what NO OTHER lotion designed for feet or whatever, had been able to do--it moisturized that skin, cut down on the dryness, and repaired the damage.</li>
      <li>I can tell that my skin is more even toned and some of my stretch marks are less apparent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The ingredients are natural and do not contain anything that irritates my very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have a type of psoriasis on my ankle that flares up frequently.  </li>
      <li>My skin was already soft and this lotion makes it feel even softer.</li>
      <li>Doctors won&#x27;t promote it because it will take the money out of their pockets, but it&#x27;s a natural healer...</li>
      <li>I like this product because it contains no alcohol and is not very heavy.</li>
      <li>The Trimedica pure MSM lotion made my skin itch and feel tight and dry which is the exact opposite of what you are wanting a lotion to do!  </li>
      <li>My skin, especially the very dry patches, feels so soft after applying the lotion.  </li>
      <li>Very frustrating as it isn&#x27;t easy to find Timedica in the shops near me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using this product for years and have had great reasults with it.  It&#x27;s too bad very few people I met have ever heard of MSN and it&#x27;s use.  It truly can be a pain killer!</li>
    <li> I bought an 8oz bottle of this stuff a couple of years ago. When I tried it on my very dry heels, toes, etc (I live in southern California &amp; wear sandles most of the time) it did what NO OTHER lotion designed for feet or whatever, had been able to do--it moisturized that skin, cut down on the dryness, and repaired the damage. Or, at the very least, allowed it to repair itself. I cannot recc this stuff enough! You don&#x27;t need a whole lot, but if you use it every day for a hard case of skin dryness, you will go through an 8oz bottle in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying a bottle for my mother this year, and another one for myself.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it has become a staple for me. My skin was already soft and this lotion makes it feel even softer. I don&#x27;t know if it helps with skin tightening as you lose weight, but I&#x27;&#x27;ll be sure and review again about that in a few months. The seller is very prompt, it comes quickly. I will be ordering it here again.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was doing the HCG diet.  I did not like the smell of it.  I later found that I could use Burt&#x27;s Bees products and those are really nice.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it contains no alcohol and is not very heavy. However, why did Trimedica decide to remove the label, \\&quot;No Heavy Metals, Guranatee 99.9% Pure\\&quot; from the product I received? It used to have it in the older batches that I ordered. This seems kinda shady on Trimedica&#x27;s part and makes me a bit uneasy. Therefore I&#x27;m going to try the MRM MSM Cream instead.</li>
    <li> I bought powdered MSM to ingest, but much prefer to use the lotion...readily absorbed into the skin with the added bonus of a skin softener. I have used Trimedica MSM products for many years &amp; trust their purity &amp; effectiveness,</li>
    <li> I have been Trimedica products for years.  I find that this lotion is wonderful for use under makeup, put on a sore muscle, or just dry skin.  Its better than a lot of msm lotions because of the purity. A lot of lotions add bad stuff.  I would recommend any product from this company.</li>
    <li> I bought this for pain relief but it gave none. Nice lotion with pure ingredients for legs &amp; arms, but not pain relief.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying the MSM lotion. Usually I mix in the cream with some coco butter. I really like this lotion. I have some eczema on my right leg. Right around the knee. I use this lotion everyday, twice a day after a shower. I haven&#x27;t had a flare up since I started using it.</li>
    <li> I had been having trouble with the outside of my right foot hurting badly. I had xrays done and there was no bone crack(this is a common fracture on  older people like me).  I rubbed this product on the outside edge of the foot and after about a week all the tenderness was gone.</li>
    <li> Although I received no analgesic benefits from Trimedica Pure MSM Lotion, I find its emollient properties very helpful.  My skin, especially the very dry patches, feels so soft after applying the lotion.  My only problem was with the seller, Potential Dynamix LLC.  Twice I ordered the lotion and twice I recieved a liquid to be taken internally.  Very frustrating as it isn&#x27;t easy to find Timedica in the shops near me. Seller aside, I do recommed Trimedica Pure MSM Lotion.</li>
    <li> Trimedica Pure MSM lotion is a good quality product. I was impressed that it&#x27;s 15% MSM which is the highest ratio of MSM I&#x27;ve found so far in a lotion or cream. It DOES help reduce pain from inflammation when rubbed into skin over achey areas. I also take MSM powder and Glucosamine with organic apple juice and together; these do reduce my pain levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are natural and do not contain anything that irritates my very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great!!! I have been using this for about 3 weeks now with the MSM soap. I can tell that my skin is more even toned and some of my stretch marks are less apparent. I&#x27;m not sure all that this lotion helps with, but it does wonders for my skin. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the lotion I mixed with the arnica oil and the iodine. I used to use this on my husband for the osteoporosis in his spine. He  tried the osteo-bio-flex and the msm  orally and it did&#x27;t seem to help much. This did. He has been gone about 6 months now and my hands are starting to get the arthritis thing going so I guess I never got it before because I was using this on him.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about 6 months, and I really like it. It feels pleasant going on, and I think it moisturizes and gets msm into your skin, which is what I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT -  I have ordered this product 6 times now. 3 out of the 6 times, I ordered the lotion, but got the msm liquid instead, which is meant to be ingested, not applied topically. I double checked my order each time, and I ordered correctly. The bottles do look a a lot alike, but that doesn&#x27;t excuse shipping the wrong product 50% of the time.</li>
    <li> This is great lotion.  It seems to take away soreness in my wrist and elbow.  It is unscented and non-greasy.  I use it as an all over body lotion.</li>
    <li> Nice cream lotion but it didn&#x27;t relieve the pain in my thighs.  I would not order again.  Can&#x27;t say if I would recommend unless I tried it on a different pain site.</li>
    <li> This is NOT lotion. it&#x27;s edible MSM liquid....not at all the same:(  too much trouble to send it back so we tried it...NASTY doesn&#x27;t begin to cover this!</li>
    <li> The Trimedica pure MSM lotion made my skin itch and feel tight and dry which is the exact opposite of what you are wanting a lotion to do!  I much prefer and recommend [[ASIN:B001KQ7OIE Sunfood MSM Lotion/Cream, Pure &amp; Natural, 8oz]] which is also available in 32 oz size from various sellers.  While I prefer unscented, this lotion is available in Berry Vanilla, Orange Ylang Ylang, Coconut Rose, and Medicinal (Tea Tree Oil).</li>
    <li> I purchase this brand of MSM. it is the purest of MSM currently being sold with 15% MSM in the ingredients. Most other MSM brands have 12% MSM in them. I use this on my face, eczema on my thighs, and even on my feet...I rub it on my neck &amp; shoulders for pain and it instantly erases the pain. I highly recommend this product.  Doctors won&#x27;t promote it because it will take the money out of their pockets, but it&#x27;s a natural healer...Sulfur..that&#x27;s all it is.</li>
    <li> It is a light lotion. Just not for me, I have very dry skin. I didn&#x27;t notice much difference. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I have a type of psoriasis on my ankle that flares up frequently.  When it flares up I have to put an ice pack on it to reduce the severe burning sensation. If I use this product every day the psoriasis does not flare up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have tried many prescription drugs and none of them have worked.  This is the only product that provides relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very grateful to have the MSM Lotion.</li>
