      <li>So HAPPY that I can STILL find it!</li>
      <li>This kind of pricing should not be allowed through an online source where the best deal is sought.</li>

      <li>I am very pleased with the service at Amazon.</li>
      <li>I am so happy I am now able to order it online.</li>
      <li>Why take away a good product that I love and can&#x27;t buy any more.&lt;br /&gt;Rachel</li>
      <li>My husband had said that he always liked this fragrance on me</li>
      <li>the coty wild musk is the best smelling perfume I have smelled</li>
      <li>Coty wild musk is the best there is.</li>
      <li>I love this scent, however I think the scent formula has been changed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased except one of the bottles leaked.</li>
      <li>So glad I found it.</li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>14--I love the soothing scent, not over whelming</li>
      <li>I have many allergies and cannot wear most perfumes.  </li>
      <li>In these times, how many perfumes can you say that about?</li>
      <li>Musk oil by cody was and still is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure people who love and wear this perfume agree.</li>
      <li>Anyone else notice their animals getting frisky after using it and then touching your pets?</li>
      <li>I LOVE THE SMELL OF THIS OIL</li>
      <li>I LOVE this oil,.</li>
      <li>The whole process of purchasing this item was very easy, and I was delighted to receive the product from the USA via my sister (who lives there).  </li>
      <li>She hasn&#x27;t had it in over 8 years and was thrilled that we found an original perfume oil.</li>
      <li>The scent is not as strong as what I am used to.  </li>
      <li>I started wearing this musk in high school and loved it.  </li>
      <li>And it is not even available.  </li>
      <li>This little bit of WONDERFUL scent is better than nothing -- but it IS almost nothing unless you use the whole bottle at once, and I can&#x27;t afford that!  </li>
      <li>Many thanks to all concerned....</li>
      <li>They are only making the spray which does not smell as good.</li>
      <li>the only place that i knew where it was on the net stopped carrying it eiter, thank u kind sellers of amazon for having it, my mom is no longer funky lol</li>
      <li>Not only was it ok for my skin, but I received many compliments regarding the scent.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
      <li>When I received it I was very satisfied, unlike some of the reviews I thought it smelled the same as it always had.</li>
      <li>I was, therefore, thrilled to find it here, and ordered several bottles.  </li>
      <li>I emailed them back and told them that instead of just dropping the oil line, they should have used the internet to form some kind of campaign to see if there was still a need to make this product.</li>
      <li>If it isnt made by Cody, it just isnt the right stuff.  </li>
      <li>Got exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>Not everybody wants to walk around wearing those strong sweet fragrances that all smell the same anyway.  </li>
      <li>It is not the original Coty Wild Musk.  </li>
      <li>I love it ,It lasts a long time</li>
      <li>but I hadn&#x27;t worn it for years and couldn&#x27;t really find it anywhere.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!</li>
      <li>I thought I was buying the real deal.</li>
      <li>I have been ordering my Wild Musk Oil by Coty for about the last year now through Amazon - not always with the same distributor, but they have all been pretty comparable and I am very pleased.</li>
      <li>I will buy again very soon.</li>
      <li>The delivery time time was very prompt.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very upset that this product has been discontinued.</li>
      <li>I started using the oil musk in the early 1970&#x27;s and have been able to find it at Wal-Mart until recently.  </li>
      <li>This is an old favorite of my friends that she can no longer find in Britain so it&#x27;ll be a surprise birthday present.  </li>
      <li>Like many other reviews, I too, wore Coty Wild Musk Oil for years, and always got compliments on it.  </li>
      <li>Coty really dropped the ball and when you buy these other oils claiming to be the original, you never know what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
      <li>I put it on in the right places and by mid day the scent was null....</li>
      <li>got it for my mom, cant find it any where where i live and</li>
      <li>It really disappoints me to see an item, Wild Musk Oil by Coty, which I used to get for $1.00 from trays and baskets at various shopping outlets, now cost so much.  </li>
      <li>The same has happened with some of my other favorite fragrances from the \\&quot;70&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I was happy to at least have a hint of it for a little while.</li>
      <li>Although it continued to be my favorite, it became so hard to find that I eventually quit wearing it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 53yrs old now.  </li>
      <li>am 50 years old and have used it since I was a young teenager.</li>
      <li>It is now $159.00 for one.5 oz Coty Wild Musk By Coty</li>
      <li>I really hope they reconsider and put it back on the shelves.</li>
      <li>I have worn Coty Musk since I was 16 yrs old.</li>
      <li>I emailed the company about 3 months ago to see if I just couldn&#x27;t buy it directly from them instead of searching the internet everytime</li>
      <li>I have looked high and low too, and can&#x27;t find the oil anywhere, nor does any other musk oil really compare.  </li>
      <li>but unfortunately they&#x27;ve discontinued it which makes it a rare find!!!</li>
      <li>My mom is 75 years old and has used it as long as I can remember.</li>

<li> They stated that they are no longer making it, they&#x27;re making new horribly stinky designer perfumes now.</li>
<li> It smells weak!  </li>
<li> What is wrong you?</li>
<li> Family members agree with me that the scent is very faint, and they don&#x27;t remember it being this weak either.  </li>
<li> It is very difficult to find in stores.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t beleave how stupid a company can be.</li>
<li> and I think it&#x27;s a stupid move on their part.</li>

    <li> Musk oil by cody was and still is my favorite. I don&#x27;t by the sprays. Not even close to musk musk oil in the bottle. Why take away a good product that I love and can&#x27;t buy any more.&lt;br /&gt;Rachel Hughes Anniston al</li>
    <li> I WANT MY MUSK OIL BY COTY BACK!!!! THE ONE IN THE LITTLE BROWN BOTTLE. PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!&lt;br /&gt;I am 50 years old and have used it since I was a young teenager. As my mom did as well. My mom is 75 years old and has used it as long as I can remember. We both miss it and WANT IT BACK PLEASE!! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE!  PLEASE! PLEASE!  PLEASE! PLEASE!  PLEASE</li>
    <li> Got exactly what I ordered. I&#x27;m pleased except one of the bottles leaked. Was not broke.</li>
    <li> It is not the original Coty Wild Musk.  I started using the oil musk in the early 1970&#x27;s and have been able to find it at Wal-Mart until recently.  The scent is modified and the oil concentration is less. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> The whole process of purchasing this item was very easy, and I was delighted to receive the product from the USA via my sister (who lives there).  This is an old favorite of my friends that she can no longer find in Britain so it&#x27;ll be a surprise birthday present.  Many thanks to all concerned....A*****</li>
    <li> It really disappoints me to see an item, Wild Musk Oil by Coty, which I used to get for $1.00 from trays and baskets at various shopping outlets, now cost so much.  I lateere could not find this in the stores and resorted to ordering online.  I started paying $8.00 a bottle, which later turned to $18.50 a bottle.  It is now $159.00 for one.5 oz Coty Wild Musk By Coty For Women Perfume Oil bottle!!!!  And it is not even available.  The same has happened with some of my other favorite fragrances from the \\&quot;70&#x27;s.  This kind of pricing should not be allowed through an online source where the best deal is sought.</li>
    <li> I think it used to last longer yes. I remember putting it on in the morning and it lasted all day. I was happy to at least have a hint of it for a little while. I thought I was buying the real deal. For this price, I won&#x27;t be buying it again. But I have had a strange side effect. My cat gets aroused and tries to mount both the females in the house. What&#x27;s up with that? The oil gets on their coats after I hold them. Anyone else notice their animals getting frisky after using it and then touching your pets?</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE SMELL OF THIS OIL AND IT LASTS A REALLY LONG TIME.  I GET A TON OF COMPLIMENTS ON IT EVERY TIME I WEAR IT.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!</li>
    <li> got it for my mom, cant find it any where where i live and the only place that i knew where it was on the net stopped carrying it eiter, thank u kind sellers of amazon for having it, my mom is no longer funky lol</li>
    <li> I LOVE this oil,.Have been wearing it for years,..AND am sad it has become sooo hard to find,..Thank God for Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> I have used this Musk Oil for the past twenty years. It is very difficult to find in stores. I am so happy I am now able to order it online. Shipping was quick. I am very pleased with the service at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been ordering my Wild Musk Oil by Coty for about the last year now through Amazon - not always with the same distributor, but they have all been pretty comparable and I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> The scent is not as strong as what I am used to.  I put it on in the right places and by mid day the scent was null....it usually lasts all day, so I was surprised and disappointed.</li>
    <li> What is wrong you? Coty wild musk is the best there is. I can&#x27;t beleave how stupid a company can be. If it works don&#x27;t try to fix it. Please keep it in our stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this since I was 14--I love the soothing scent, not over whelming and I always get compliments.  So HAPPY that I can STILL find it!</li>
    <li> Like many other reviews, I too, wore Coty Wild Musk Oil for years, and always got compliments on it.  Plus, it lasted all day, the scent never wore off.  I can&#x27;t imagine for the life of me why Coty quit manufacturing it.  And yes, the cologne spray DOES NOT smell the same, or last as long.  I just loved the oil.  I have looked high and low too, and can&#x27;t find the oil anywhere, nor does any other musk oil really compare.  Crying shame...</li>
    <li> I have worn Coty Musk since I was 16 yrs old. I&#x27;m 53yrs old now.  I love this scent, however I think the scent formula has been changed. It smells weak!  The delivery time time was very prompt.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this product. My local store doesn&#x27;t carry anymore. I will buy again very soon.</li>
    <li> My husband had said that he always liked this fragrance on me but I hadn&#x27;t worn it for years and couldn&#x27;t really find it anywhere. When I received it I was very satisfied, unlike some of the reviews I thought it smelled the same as it always had.</li>
    <li> Just an FYI... Coty has stopped manufacturing their small bottle of Wild Musk Oil totally. They are only making the spray which does not smell as good. I emailed the company about 3 months ago to see if I just couldn&#x27;t buy it directly from them instead of searching the internet everytime I wanted it.  They stated that they are no longer making it, they&#x27;re making new horribly stinky designer perfumes now. I emailed them back and told them that instead of just dropping the oil line, they should have used the internet to form some kind of campaign to see if there was still a need to make this product. Everywhere I go I see people talking about how they&#x27;ve worn it for years as I have and I think it&#x27;s a stupid move on their part. In these times, how many perfumes can you say that about? Not everybody wants to walk around wearing those strong sweet fragrances that all smell the same anyway.  I always get compliments on the oil because it&#x27;s DIFFERENT!  Coty really dropped the ball and when you buy these other oils claiming to be the original, you never know what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
    <li> I love it ,It lasts a long time and I get a lot of compliments. .</li>
    <li> Rating should be 3-STARS (can&#x27;t change here). I have many allergies and cannot wear most perfumes.  I started wearing this musk in high school and loved it.  Not only was it ok for my skin, but I received many compliments regarding the scent.  Although it continued to be my favorite, it became so hard to find that I eventually quit wearing it.  I was, therefore, thrilled to find it here, and ordered several bottles.  BUT-Is it me, or has the formula been watered down (a LOT)?! Family members agree with me that the scent is very faint, and they don&#x27;t remember it being this weak either.  What&#x27;s the story, or are all the noses in my family failing?  This little bit of WONDERFUL scent is better than nothing -- but it IS almost nothing unless you use the whole bottle at once, and I can&#x27;t afford that!  My initial excitement and plans of regularly ordering this product have shifted to a search for viable alternatives.</li>
    <li> the coty wild musk is the best smelling perfume I have smelled I bought it for my friend but also loved it myself</li>
    <li> She loves this stuff and I couldnt find it anywhere else.  If it isnt made by Cody, it just isnt the right stuff.  Her words, not mine</li>
    <li> Bring back this oil please, yall should have got rid of that stinky spray and kept the oil !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very upset that this product has been discontinued. I really hope they reconsider and put it back on the shelves. Even if the price is raised. I&#x27;m sure people who love and wear this perfume agree.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance for years but unfortunately they&#x27;ve discontinued it which makes it a rare find!!! i hope the company we&#x27;ll reconsider bring it back!! i miss this fragrance!!!</li>
    <li> This oil was a gift for my mom and she loved it. She hasn&#x27;t had it in over 8 years and was thrilled that we found an original perfume oil.</li>
    <li> Just wish I could get a bottle but they don&#x27;t make it anymore.  Love the smell.</li>
    <li> Have been looking for Musk Oil everywhere.So glad I found it.It&#x27;s the oly thing I like to put on.Smells Great!</li>
