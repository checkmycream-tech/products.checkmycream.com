      <li>easy to use and light weight.</li>
      <li>super cheap for so many pairs.</li>

      <li>They were dirt cheap</li>
      <li>and they arent even curved to fit on your eye.</li>
      <li>Get the hair glue from their, apply lightly and put on.</li>
      <li>(yes I just made up a word, but it was necessary - lol)</li>
      <li>If applied right, and touched up right, you could make them look amazing.</li>

      <li>You get a full lash look fast.</li>
      <li>I usually pay a dollar each pair at the beauty suPply but these were a great value.</li>
      <li>off which a 2 year old could do, that is how easy it is.</li>
      <li>shipped surprisingly very fast.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The lashes meet my  expectaTions, and they were a great price! I usually pay a dollar each pair at the beauty suPply but these were a great value. I will definitely purchase them again</li>
    <li> I bought these lashes not thinking that I would love them, but I really do. There great for dramatic cat eye make up. The only down fall is that they get nasty quick... I have to throw them out every week, normally I throw my lashes out every 2-3 weeks.</li>
    <li> it took about a month to receiv. They did not have a smell like other ppl said but i do agree they are a bit stiff but u can bend them before u put on. Easy to put on and once they are on they look flawless.very happy especially how cheap they are.</li>
    <li> a little longer than I would like but very pretty and lots of compliments. Easy to apply and very flexible</li>
    <li> they are a bit long but they are gorgeous and i can reuse them for a couple of uses. way better than buying individuals in the store when i run out ill def buy some more</li>
    <li> There shiny, and a little too long. i Tried a pair on &amp; they look too obvious. It kinda feels like i have umbrellas on my eyelids even when i trimmed them down a bit. I Would wear them too a Carnival .</li>
    <li> Were not made to seem natural, were meant to seem noticeable. If applied right, and touched up right, you could make them look amazing. Probably most fitting for nightlife, like to the clubs. I&#x27;m going to leave a picture so you could see how they looked on me. But overall loved them, just not the type to wear on the daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Oh yeah. The one thing I disliked, was the fact that It looked shiny from the top. Like if you closed your eyes they seemed really plastic looking.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I ordered these because of their price. I assumed I would get what I paid for them. I was pleasantly surprised and impressed. I had bought pairs of eyelashes from Sephora and Target ranging in price from $4.00 a pair to $18 a pair. I wear false eyelashes everyday so having so many is really nice. With the glue that I use from Sephora, I&#x27;m able to re-use a pair of these lashes and make them last about a week, sometimes less.</li>
    <li> the lashes look plastic, very bad quilty</li>
    <li> I really love these lashes. I got them randomly because I was looking for something cheap and cute for a dolly eye look and these are super perfect for the look I&#x27;m trying to achieve. I get compliments on them a lot; they really open up my eyes and make them look big and bright!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://36.media.tumblr.com/31a88952040cec27f8aef5d9aa1f7d15/tumblr_nj67toQQqK1sjam19o1_500.png&lt;br /&gt;http://41.media.tumblr.com/a02d60c4d5ad52d4ca8729d85a8ce892/tumblr_nj7x2odw4c1sjam19o1_500.png</li>
    <li> It took almost a month for the lashes to come and when they came they look like bat wings on top of my eyes</li>
    <li> Dont stick and RIP EASILY! I have to use AT LEAST USE 4 PAIR EACH TIME YOU USE THEM. NOT worth the price no matter how cheap!</li>
    <li> They were not what I thought they were. They&#x27;re made with plastic and not for everyday wear.&lt;br /&gt;I was told to remove my rating and comments to receive my money back and I never received it after removing the comment.</li>
    <li> I do not wear fake lashes...i bought these as a gift for a friend. she absolutely loved them...they did look a little costume to me, but i wasnt the one who had to wear them. i think if u load them down with too much of the black gunk on them, it makes them look fake. good price....was worth the two wk wait....</li>
    <li> I was very pleased at the price when I bought these. They arrived a week before they were suppose to which was a really great plus. Shipping was free and I wear them almost everyday! They&#x27;re perfect for my eyes and are re-usable I will be buying again. I absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> They were OK....I was disappointed in them thought they were going to be soft but ended up hard. I wouldnt suggest buying these</li>
    <li> This is a very decieving picture. Yes, I realize they are FAKE lashes and therefore will look somewhat FAKE. But these are just ridiculous. If you like big black triangle spikes on your eyes go for it. These are going with my halloween costume because they are not worth the refund. Do not order if you intend for DAILY USE.</li>
    <li> Okay loves my experience was fairly good I had this package for quite a long time because it&#x27;s reusable I clean one pair 3-5 times depending on how carful I was the color is a nice black and I liked that the lash band is somewhat thick. The hair is synthetic and it&#x27;s very unrealistic in comparison to the natural fibers on a regular Kiss lashes but if thats not a big deal go right ahead and go for it!</li>
    <li> They came very late i had to wait a whole month to receive them because they came from hong kong, But overall they are very beautiful and last a long time. Its a great find!!!!! in a beauty supply store on set of lashes can cost you 1.99 i got 10 pair for 1.55. So that&#x27;s amazing if your a make up person like me. So thumbs up!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love big and flashy.. these are very noticeable!  I wish the ribbon holding them was a little more flexible.  It is in its own shape and it holds true to that on your eye.  Some lashes were weird and when I put them on I though they would contour to my eye shape.  Nope!  If they bent forward you could tell on my eye.  I trashed about 3 pairs because of this, but at the price I paid, it was still a great deal!</li>
    <li> I love these eyelashes because, I have big eyes and they really enhance the shape of my eyes. I would not recommend these for people with small eyes because, they are so thick and, heavy that they will overwhelm a person with small eyes face. I have seen people with small eyes wearing these and they look so silly. These lashes are made for the big eyed people only at least that is what I think.</li>
    <li> Its too fake, looks awful.its not hair. Its a plastic. Waste of money. Its not sticking with any glue.not recommending at all.</li>
    <li> The box it came in was crushed and a pair was ruined :( but the other 9 Were fine, maybe if they can reenforce the packaging they come in that would be nice.</li>
    <li> super cheap for so many pairs. arrived quickly. I do cosplay and these are great for that and also for my models when I do photo shoots. They are nice and heavy and thick and show up well on camera.</li>
    <li> Very very thick. I have small eyes so they really stand out when I wear them. I only wear them at raves or other big events. They&#x27;re not for everyday wear. Good for the price it&#x27;s at! I love how it looks when it&#x27;s on.</li>
    <li> I ended up giving these eyelashes away. They are too thick, too long, and too fake looking and not real human hair..</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like it I wore them 2 times and it just didn&#x27;t look picture perfect. They&#x27;re long and dramatic looking</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for quality when purchasing these lashes, although I was looking for them to resemble the lashes in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lashes I received were not as long and not nearly as dense as the ones in the picture. As a fix I glued 3 lashes together on top of each other with nail glue and it was an easy fix. Delivery took maybe 1.5 weeks and might purchase again despite having to doctor them.</li>
    <li> They are a bit long. But you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price. I have found after wearing one a couple of times I like them better because they aren&#x27;t so stiff.</li>
    <li> Much too thick and false looking to be worn in public. Will probably never be worn in public. Buy higher quality!</li>
    <li> These are good for the price. I always double mines because they are flimsy. Sometimes I trim them down because they are extra long in length. They are long I have small eyes so I cut them before I put them on also. Item as described. Looks exactly as pictured.  I will purchase more when I run out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an eyelash lover and this?? No can do .... this are very hard and plasticky (yes I just made up a word, but it was necessary - lol) I&#x27;ve worn these things once and now they just hang out in my collection - this might be suitable for costumes or something.... but for now I&#x27;ll just use them to show &amp;#34;newbie eyelash wearers&amp;#34; what not to buy!! To each his own but for me - Meh</li>
    <li> I understand they are probably not meant for everyday use but for the price I thought I&#x27;d order them anyways. Came Fast, but the box was all tore up and the lashes smelled like chemicals. They are really stiff, and made of plastic. Not too mention really, really long ! Not too happy, but hey for the price I can&#x27;t complain too much. You get what you pay for. Buy at your own risk !</li>
    <li> just the right amount for day. easy to use and light weight. I would order these again at this price.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely horrible!! They do not stick at all and the glue sucks too. I can&#x27;t believe I wasted my money on junk like this. Now ima have to trash them</li>
    <li> These eyelashes have a very firm plastic like thing that you put the glue on to attach to your lids. It is not very flexible, so it doesn&#x27;t line up easily with your lids. The middle stays on fine, but the ends won&#x27;t stay down. They were dirt cheap so I can&#x27;t complain, but they are pretty useless and are probably going to end up in the trash. Also they don&#x27;t come with eyelash glue so I bought a pair of lashes from the store that came with glue. Those lashes wound up being flexible and easy to apply. I should have just done that in the first place. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
    <li> These eyelashes look super fake like they are made out of plastic. They are so stiff i couldn&#x27;t even get them to stay on.</li>
    <li> Like the tittle says, it was less than $2 and was shipped for free. So, I mean what did I expect? Plastic /okay-ish quality and a &amp;#34;obvious-fake-looking-eyelashes&amp;#34; look. But again, for two dollars it wasn&#x27;t THATTT bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate seeing review from people expecting super high quality; acting like a ton of money was spent on these eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, you get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really like these fake eyelashes. They don&#x27;t stick on very well. Way too dramatic looking. I wish these eyelashes would&#x27;ve came in different styles instead of one style.</li>
    <li> i really do like the look of these they last very well&lt;br /&gt;i wish i would of got the natural&#x27;s also but i will net time....thank you</li>
    <li> For the price, this is an amazing product! I bought these for my teenage daughters to have fun with, as they wear far too much mascara. Unfortunately, they won&#x27;t use them, as they look really fake when they are on. I think they would be really great for stage performances, where you want the intensity of the lashes, but people will be seeing you from afar.</li>
    <li> These are best for dramatic looks. You won&#x27;t get anything natural looking with these eyelashes. But they look really sexy with a smoky eye or a thick cat eye look. Great for the price!</li>
    <li> heap quality, they fall apart if you dont take them out gently. they bend and separate, they are all plastic and look plastic. but still a good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these lashes and will buy them again! This is my first time buying and wearing false eyelashes and I&#x27;m so happy with these. Of course it took about a month to ship, but I&#x27;m wearing them as we speak and they&#x27;re very comfortable.</li>
    <li> all I can say is, she loved those too, Thank You...when she&#x27;s happy, the whole house is happy, again Thanks.</li>
    <li> With these lashes you do get what you pay for! THEY DONT STICK ULESS YOU USE A LOT OF GLUE! They took a month to come and the box was damaged when I got them the lashes don&#x27;t lay right I hate this product!</li>
    <li> I bough several of these packs con is they take a while as they do come from China pro they come with a lot of pairs and many styles and lengths to chose from and they are beyond affordable but the thing I didn&#x27;t like is that they are synthetic so they do look shiny but not to much like other lashes I&#x27;ve seen but it clearly says in the description so for what it is it&#x27;s a great buy with very great price I would recommend for those on a budget or maybe if u are just starting with makeup or learning to apply lashes these are great for that</li>
    <li> These are synthetic lashes that are great fun.  They can be used repeatedly if you take care of them properly.</li>
    <li> I am a make up artist and these eyelashes work wonders. They have a guide line on the sides that make it easier to hold and apply. They match the eyes natural curve creating a sultry sensual look.</li>
    <li> These lashes are nice and bold. You get a full lash look fast. If you are looking for a thin natural lash then this is not for you. Again, these are a full fun lash that makes a difinite statement. The band is strong and the lashes hold up. Would recommend and buy again. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Value for money, considering how little I paid for them. They were easy to use and looked good for the custom party I needed to wear them for .</li>
    <li> what the crap? has no sticky strip on them and they arent even curved to fit on your eye. they dont even look like the pic. theyre tacky and sooooo cheap! DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> These eyelashes were shipped on but they were terrible too flimsy to stay on.</li>
    <li> Exquisite eyelashes and 10 pair at a really good price.  Look real and are very soft.  I would purchase them again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to fake lashes but since these were so cheap, I thought &amp;#34;Why Not?&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;They shipped surprisingly very fast. Once I got them, I tried them on. They went on easily and were fine. Definitely not a natural look but I can make them work on special occasions .</li>
    <li> I have no idea how to put on fake eyelashes but I have tried it before and these eyelashes are sooo uncomfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t know how to apply eyelashes well these might be a challenge. Very pretty just a little denser than I&#x27;m comfortable with. Look great though.</li>
    <li> I love ordering lashes from China! These are so sexy, I have to say if your a professional makeup artist like I am this is a must item to purchase ;)</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a huge money saver for me seeing as I buy a single pair for about 3X the amount but you get what you pay for. They do look beautiful and ship very fast without any hassle but they almost feel like paper kind of poky and are extremely hard to apply. I wasn&#x27;t able to apply. I don&#x27;t think it was my eyelash adhesive (Revlon Precision Dark Lash Adhesive).</li>
    <li> I thought they were different but I still like the way they look i think , my eyes have to be a bit bigger for them but still happy with my lashes</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible they did not bend couldn&#x27;t put them on properly because of their shape&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing lashes for years and these were the worst</li>
    <li> No, No, No! when I tried these on, my eyes just looked weird! they don&#x27;t have a lot of curl to them, they&#x27;re just straight and aren&#x27;t flexible. They shaped my eyes weird and I looked like I had freaky shaped eyes. NEVER AGAIN!</li>
    <li> They looked just like the display and make your eyes look fuller. I totally recommend these eyelashes. You get more fir your money. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I choose a rating of 4 because the lashes actually looked longer in the photo, but all in all they are fine. Well worth the money. My item was delivered wayyyy before the delivery date, so KUDOS for that!!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product if you wear false lashes on a daily basis!</li>
    <li> They are too wide for my eyes and when I cut the ends to fit the wires kept poking me making it uncomfortable to wear but other than that great if u have large eyes</li>
    <li> Big beautiful lashes but no glue :( wish I was able to wear them now I have to buy glue that cost twice more and have to wait :/</li>
    <li> EXACTLY what i was looking for! LONG THICK dolly looking eyelashes! they look AMAZING, made a purchase with another account so i bought a pair to keep the item on my account, then thouht about it and bought6 more! i just love these beautiful dolly eyelashes!!! THANX!</li>
    <li> Do not look natural like those bought in store.</li>
    <li> The package came all destroyed, the lashes smell really bad, like old fish, I&#x27;m afraid to wear them, they were cheap but not worth it, also the deliver took really long time !!!</li>
    <li> Good quality for a super cheap price. Loved these.</li>
    <li> These are different than the ones you may normally use.  If you are having trouble putting them on then you should probably use hair glue that you get from the hair store.  I wouldn&#x27;t get the glue from anywhere like Sally&#x27;s, because they overcharge for their stuff anyway.  Go to the hair store where they sell a lot of weave, the ones that the asians own (no racism intended).  Get the hair glue from their, apply lightly and put on. You are good to go. A friend of mine had these before I did and I didn&#x27;t know if these were the same ones she had or not.  They are great and look great too.  She used hair glue and at first I was like wtf because I have never worn lashes before but it worked perfect.  So I would recommend the hair glue.  Remember not a light, just squeeze for a little bit to come out and apply lightly on the entire line.  May put up a video review so anyone decided to try it will see how it is done. You don&#x27;t see any glue or anything plus if  you mess up you can just take it off and try again. The glue comes off easily too.  I was not sure about sleeping with the lashes on so I took them off before I went to bed an reapplied them in the morning.  Just peel the glue off which a 2 year old could do, that is how easy it is.</li>
    <li> These are pretty decent lashes for the price. The quality is nice but the lashes themselves are kind of heavy if you aren&#x27;t used to thick ones like these. It took quite a while to arrive though because it ships from Hong Kong or something.</li>
    <li> I am so so happy with this purchase :)  They are perfect and great quality and much much nicer than lashes that are triple the price - a real homerun !!</li>
    <li> these are nice if you don&#x27;t like too much flair,just a lil something... extra on your lids,can use them at least 2x&#x27;s</li>
