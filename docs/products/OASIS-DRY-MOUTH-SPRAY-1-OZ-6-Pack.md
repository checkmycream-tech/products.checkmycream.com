<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have dry mouth because of medication and from using a CPap machine.  At night my mouth would get so dry it was causing problems with my teeth and gums.  A few sprays of Oasis Mouthwash Spray relieves the discomfort and keeps away dry mouth.</li>
    <li> This is a good buy.  Much less expensive than the drug or grocery stores. Also, in my rural area I can&#x27;t always find it.  My spouse had throat cancer and treatments effected his salivary glands.  He uses alot of this product. Likes it much better than the competitor. Fast delivery of a good product at low cost. What could be better?!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I sleep with a C-PAP machine that includes a mouth piece that helps hold the &amp;#34;nasal cushions&amp;#34; to my nose as I cannot stand to have any straps around my head.  My mouth often gets dry &amp; Oasis is the only brand I&#x27;ve tried that I liked.</li>
    <li> My order came earlier than promised.  It&#x27;s a good deal, can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Best dry mouth spray I&#x27;ve found,  tastes good and lasts a bit</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for those who have dentures. It seems that with dentures , the roof of your mouth tends to get very dry &amp; bread would stick to it. A few sprays &amp; you can eat your sandwich with no problem .</li>
    <li> The spray is terrific.  When I wake up at night I grab the bottle and spray my mouth.  This provides moisture and sooths my mouth so that my tongue isn&#x27;t stuck to the roof of my mouth in the morning.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best mouth spray for dry mouth!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Tastes great and it is something you can use as often as you want and no harm in swallowing it.  Convenient and small enough to carry in purse or pocket.  Sorry they don&#x27;t sell it retail any more but that is OK we have Amazon to take of us!</li>
    <li> For me, this product is more effective than all others on the market.  I recommend it completely and the vendor that supplied it!!</li>
    <li> I have Sjorgrens Syndrome.  This product makes my dry mouth so much better. I don&#x27;t know why my CVS doesn&#x27;t carry it.</li>
    <li> When it comes to helping with dry mouth, this is the best. Works much better (and tastes better) than the competition....</li>
    <li> This is the only artificial syliva product that works and tastes good.  I use it during excerise.  My husband uses it post radiation treatments that damanged his salivary glands.  My mom uses it because she&#x27;s on oxygen.  This product is much better than Biotene.  We&#x27;ve all tried both.  You won&#x27;t be disappointend.</li>
    <li> This tastes much better than other products on the market.  Makes a dry mouth feel slick and moist. I think the directions say to use 3 sprays. I use 4 sprays.</li>
    <li> This product is rated 4 instead of 5 because it isn&#x27;t quite as good as Biotene but it is much more affordable and I will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time for dry mouth.  Easy to use and has a nice mint taste.  I&#x27;m glad I can get them from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd or 4th time to order Oasis Mouthwash Spray online.  I use it in the night for an extremely dry mouth.  This last shipment went as expected but the taste was different.  It was the first time I realized there were different flavors.</li>
    <li> This is not mouthwash, it&#x27;s a moisturizing spray for dry mouth.  I love it and have a hard time finding it in the stores.  I bought it on Amazon twice,  and it&#x27;s very good.  Good taste,  and good results.</li>
    <li> I tried many products and they did not work for any length of time. Oasis Dry Mouth spray gives better relief and lasts far longer than the other products I have tried.  It has been hard to find on the drugstore shelves.  Ordering via Amazon is much simplier.</li>
    <li> amazing that they take stuff like this off the shelves in the drug store. Used it for years and all of a sudden it&#x27;s gone. Great product to keep your mouth hydrated. Now got enough (had to get a six pack) to last for a couple years.</li>
    <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product for dry mouth. I have been using this product since 2005 when I underwent throat cancer radiation and it is a FANTASTIC product. Amazon is the BEST way to purchase this product in bulk.!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product better than anything else on the market. It works very well and tastes so much better than others. I take a medication that dries my mouth out so much that it feels like I have cotton in my mouth. I keep a bottle of this in my purse, on my night stand, in the kitchen and in my car. I never leave home without it.</li>
    <li> As someone who is plagued with dry mouth due to medication side effects, I&#x27;ve tried just about every product on the market. I keep trying other products because this is rather pricey, but there&#x27;s nothing that works as well as Oasis! Basically, all dry mouth products will help to some extent, but the ONLY one that provides longlasting relief is Oasis.&lt;br /&gt;Oasis has a very mild, pleasant mint taste... imho the best flavor I&#x27;ve found in dry mouth products. (the absolute worst related to taste is Biotene spray).&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it works so well and has a nice taste makes this my favorite. I might wince at the price but it truly is worth every penny. I never want to be without it.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, this seller has the best price.</li>
    <li> My husband uses it along with the biotene mouth spray.  Wanted to get the biotene spray but it was recalled because of a packaging error.</li>
    <li> I suffer from BMS and dry mouth and the mouth spray gives me some relief and helps during the night as well.</li>
    <li> i have to use this because I&#x27;ve had dry mouth for years because of the medications that I take. I try to keep it everywhere and spritz it on as soon as I notice my mouth drying. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t keep my mouth dry all night but on the other hand, neither does anything else! This product has a nice taste. They stopped selling it, or anything else for the same purpose, in my area. Since I never want to run out of it and keep it in so many places, I order the 6 pack (which is, also, a better price)!</li>
    <li> HAPPY TO FIND SOMEONE TO SUPPLY ME WITH MY FAVORITE MOISTURIZING MOUTHWASH. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR STASH SUPPLY. WILHELMINA MAGUIRE</li>
    <li> The only dry mouth spray that does not burn or have an off taste especially during the night. Only takes 3 squirts and the soothing moisture lasts a long time, an hour or more , but why is it so expensive?  I can&#x27;t do without it, and its better than a mint. I&#x27;ve tried all the leading brands and Oasis is the very best.  I don&#x27;t care for the mouthwash; it burns.</li>
    <li> Oasis is great for dry mouth. I think it is by far the best -tasting of any of the dry mouth sprays that I have tried.</li>
    <li> I have extreme dry mouth. This keeps the problem at bay. Bioteen is also good but I prefer the flavor of Oasis.</li>
    <li> On the directions it says spray in your mouth.  When I think of spray I think of misting, this product just shoots one line of product and then what do I do with it?  The directions don&#x27;t say anything else.  Swish it around??  What...</li>
    <li> I have tried a few similar products, but this one works the best.</li>
    <li> I suffer EXTREME dryness. I have health issues and have found nothing else that works for my mouth. I have tried other products and OASIS is by far the best. I carry one in my purse have one on my vanity and one by my recliner!&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff</li>
    <li> This order arrived in an extremely timely manner!  Can&#x27;t believe it is not sold in stores down here in south texas.</li>
    <li> I have &amp;#34;drymouth&amp;#34;, a side ettect from medications, which is extremely uncomfortable.  I cannot speak when my mouth is so dry.  A &#x27;squirt&#x27; of Oasis relieves it instantly and all is well again.  There is another brand on the market, that I found very distasteful, so I&#x27;m glad I can still get Oasis and go merrily on my way.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great product. It&#x27;s the only spray that helps me &amp; tastes good too</li>
    <li> The best of all the products I have used for dry mouth symptoms.  What would make it perfect for me is if the lubrication lasted a little bit longer.  The taste of this product is very pleasant and I am very satisfied with my purchase.  I will definitely continue to use Oasis.</li>
    <li> I use this for my dry mouth, namely after going to bed. It leaves a good taste I my mouth and takes care of the dryness.&lt;br /&gt; A couple of squirts will do ya.</li>
    <li> This is expensive to use as a regular mouth wash, but as a quick spray for dry mouth it is wonderful.  It solves the dry mouth problem like nothing else will do.</li>
    <li> Perfect product to keep dry mouth from radiation therapy wet.  Works better than biotene rinse.  No need for prescription saliva drug.  Oasis spray was the answer.</li>
    <li> Good product for dry mouth - use it all the time.</li>
    <li> A delight  for annoying dry mouth.  Far preferable to other brands.  The taste is pleasant.  Have purchased a couple of times.  Thank you for carrying this product.</li>
    <li> For dry mouth syndrome, this is the best and tastiest. The other products do not taste good. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> As I have Sjogrens Syndrome, I use replacement saliva products.  Spray it on each side of the back of the mouth and in the center - this covers the saliva glands areas.  It works very well and lasts 1-2 hours, and can be used on children.  The Oasis products are very good and this product&#x27;s taste is minty.  You can make your own via glycerine and peppermint oil, but this is much more convenient, sterile and portable. Is suitable for dry mouth from Sjogrens, diabetes or meds.</li>
    <li> I have treated several sprays, and found this to be by far the best. It is effective for dry mouth and is effective for several hours. I wish it were cheaper, but there&#x27;s no point in buying cheaper alternatives when they don&#x27;t do the job very well.</li>
    <li> A family member has been using this product for many years and it has helped immensely with dry mouth.</li>
    <li> A great way to avoid dry mouth while traveling or at home.  I use it in dry hotel rooms and on airplanes.  It would also be useful for people taking medications that dry out the mouth.</li>
    <li> I have dry mouth due to medication (to the point of having receding gums and bone loss!) The dentist said it was essential that I use mouth moistureizer (&amp;#34;oral demulcent&amp;#34;) and said the other brand (Biotene) was the one to use. I am sorry, but that taste like vomit! I found Oasis in the local grocery store and LOVE IT and order in bulk now!!! I works well, taste great - but not so over-powering that your next meal will taste like mint! Give it a try if you have dry mouth - the spray works the best for me - better than the mouthwash!</li>
    <li> I have always breathed through my mouth, instead of my nose, especially at night, and have had such dry mouth that I wake up at night from it.  Oasis is the best remedy I have found for this problem.  I spray my mouth before bed and again if I wake up in the middle of the night.  It solves the dryness immediately.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, I like to have it handy since I take meds that give me dry mouth. Could only wish it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Great product for dry mouth. Keep by bedside at night, or use in the daytime as well. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> The only product on the market that really works for me.</li>
    <li> I have Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome and find Oasis mouth wash and moth spray work best for me. I can only by these on line and Amazon is the best. I wish they made toothpaste I would buy that too</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband. Quite a value.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!  Works great!</li>
