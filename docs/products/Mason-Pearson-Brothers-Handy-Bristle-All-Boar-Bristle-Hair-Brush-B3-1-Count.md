      <li>This is when i contacted Mason Pearson again and with the information they provided, i checked out the brush, kindly provided to me from the Amazon seller in question.</li>
      <li>Love the brush cleaner, it keeps the brush in good shape.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if all sellers on Amazon are selling authentic brushes</li>
      <li>I love how it feels and how it leaves my hair.  </li>
      <li>My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t like it; he says too scratchy on his scalp, but I love that scratchy, massage feeling.  </li>
      <li>8)</li>
      <li>These are the best hairbrushes and last forever</li>
      <li>Love it....</li>
      <li>The reason I purchased this brush is that I read it distributes the oils from your scalp to the ends of your hair and it makes your hair more voluminous at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We each love the brush designed for our hair type.</li>
      <li>She is quite pleased with her Mason Pearson Brothers brush and delights in the luxury of owning it.</li>
      <li>I love Mason Pearson hairbrushes, but I just got one for Christmas that I wanted to throw out the window.</li>
      <li>The brush is actually very good, makes the hair bouncy and manageable at the same time.</li>
      <li>Makes my fine hair shine.</li>
      <li>Anyone spending 150-200$ on a brush deserves to know they own an authentic product and at the same time be able to take advantage of the discounts provided by sellers on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Then I looked at the MP brush I happily use every day and read \\&quot;Nylon and Bristle\\&quot; and realized that it is NOT the same as \\&quot;all boar\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>This size will probably also work great if you have long but fine texture Caucasian hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price for a quality  beauty item!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
      <li>I tried hair products to help the hair dryness, then remembered that proper brushing distributes the natural oils, and have been very happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>The brush came promptly and I started using it right away!  </li>
      <li>great for all hair types, I&#x27;ve used their hairbrushes for 20 years and can never use any other brush.  </li>
      <li>Delivery was fast and easy.</li>
      <li>and I love the way my natural oils in my hair  distributes!  </li>
      <li>It is wonderfully gentle on my fine hair.  </li>
      <li>This particular one is good for long, fine hair.</li>
      <li>Love this brush and the handy little brush for cleaning.  </li>
      <li>I like this hairbrush, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
      <li>(have used for a couple months now), but it definitely isn&#x27;t hurting them and I&#x27;m really glad I dished out the extra $ for a better brush.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!  </li>
      <li>Another drastic check, and this is really not necessary, is to take out the top of the pad</li>
      <li>Along with a variety of Christophe Robin and John Masters Organics products, this brush is a must for anyone who wants luscious tresses!</li>
      <li>Even though my hair is medium length, at the back of my head, where the hair is thicker, I have to brush in sections to make sure that the bristles get all the way to the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I fully expect the brush to last me 20 or more years.</li>
      <li>at first glance the plastic on the handle seems almost black, but when you hold it up against light, it glows a wonderful deep ruby red.  </li>
      <li>Pure Bristle (varies with brush type)  3)</li>
      <li>Well, I never thought I would spend so much money on a hair brush, but the reviews I read were so positive</li>
      <li>I was debating between the B2 (Small Extra), the B3 (this one) and the B4 (pocket) and I am so glad I went with this handy one.</li>
      <li>However, please note, pure bristle can be used only by people with fine hair.</li>
      <li>It really made a difference in her hair.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>one instead and am MUCH happier with it.</li>
      <li>It is gentle on my scalp as well.</li>
      <li>It works really well to smooth out my long hair and to distribute oils through the lengths.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve outlined a general guide below-(this was for my large pure boar bristle hairbrush, model</li>
      <li>In conclusion, if you are nearly bald, use the all boar bristle; if you have any real hair, go with \\&quot;nylon and bristle\\&quot; or \\&quot;all nylon\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>but i believe this general guide can help customers interested in owning a Mason Pearson brush.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re gentle on your hair and distribute the natural oils.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to pay such a premium price for a hair brush, but this is worth every cent.</li>
      <li>absolutely adore this brush and wish I had bought it earlier - it seems pretty sturdy and well made.</li>
      <li>What a difference from a normal hair brush , definitely worth the extra.</li>
      <li>I also compared it with an older brush i had, which was bought directly from the manufacturer.  </li>
      <li>My family also owns one that is good for long, thick hair.</li>
      <li>The smell of singed hair would be clear or a plastic chemical odour would be the alternative.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are so soft</li>
      <li>It comes with cleaning bristles, which, if used, will probably make this brush last a whole lifetime.</li>
      <li>For starters, the quality of both the brushes was absolutely the same.</li>
      <li>I use the brush daily and it makes the styling of my hair so much easier.  </li>
      <li>I had this hairbrush as a kid and teenager, then forgot about it as an adult.</li>
      <li>The same packaging, the same good quality hard plastic,the same rubber pad etc.  </li>
      <li>I have very straight and coarse, thick Asian hair that gets oily and flat very quickly.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t see any difference in my hair after using it, compared to other types of brushes.</li>

    <li> The last hairbrush my husband will ever need! Superb quality.</li>
    <li> These brushes are expensive but worth every penny. They&#x27;re gentle on your hair and distribute the natural oils. I got one about a year ago. My hair is in the best condition it&#x27;s ever been in.</li>

    <li> Wonderful. Bought it and shared it with my daughter. It really made a difference in her hair. Expensive but worth it.</li>

    <li> I love Mason Pearson hairbrushes, but I just got one for Christmas that I wanted to throw out the window. The largest size all boar bristle brush is great...if you&#x27;re bald. I tried to brush my hair with it and it was baffled as to why it didn&#x27;t seem to, well, brush my hair. Then I looked at the MP brush I happily use every day and read \\&quot;Nylon and Bristle\\&quot; and realized that it is NOT the same as \\&quot;all boar\\&quot;. In conclusion, if you are nearly bald, use the all boar bristle; if you have any real hair, go with \\&quot;nylon and bristle\\&quot; or \\&quot;all nylon\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I splurged on a Mason Pearson brush and was feeling guilty, until I got it. It&#x27;s so worth it! It&#x27;s a beautiful object, made with care, a timeless design. And the best part is that it feels so good on the scalp. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Amazing.  I love how it feels and how it leaves my hair.  My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t like it; he says too scratchy on his scalp, but I love that scratchy, massage feeling.  I don&#x27;t know if it has improved my split ends or not, (have used for a couple months now), but it definitely isn&#x27;t hurting them and I&#x27;m really glad I dished out the extra $ for a better brush.  I&#x27;d like to save up and buy the travel size to take to school with me.  It comes with cleaning bristles, which, if used, will probably make this brush last a whole lifetime.</li>
    <li> I use this brush after I work out tangles with a wide toothed comb. It works really well to smooth out my long hair and to distribute oils through the lengths. It is gentle on my scalp as well. I used to have the &amp;#34;Extra&amp;#34; stiff boar bristle brush, but it scratched my scalp badly so I bought this regular boar bristle &amp;#34;Handy&amp;#34; one instead and am MUCH happier with it.</li>
    <li> There have been a lot of doubts over the authenticity of Mason Pearson brushes sold on Amazon. I&#x27;d recently bought a brush on Amazon and decided to contact Mason Pearson for a price comparison which is when they told me that there were plenty of forgeries on the market. I decided to return the brush, unopened, letting Amazon know that i was worried it was a fake. Unfortunately this and a couple of similar complaints by other customers resulted in the seller being taken off the Amazon Marketplace. This is when i contacted Mason Pearson again and with the information they provided, i checked out the brush, kindly provided to me from the Amazon seller in question. I also compared it with an older brush i had, which was bought directly from the manufacturer.  For starters, the quality of both the brushes was absolutely the same. The same packaging, the same good quality hard plastic,the same rubber pad etc.  I&#x27;ve outlined a general guide below-(this was for my large pure boar bristle hairbrush, model B1)-  1) The name on the handle should be in goldblocking and sunken into the plastic.  2) The name on the handle should say:  The  Mason Pearson  London England  Pure Bristle (varies with brush type)  3) There should be a hole at the end of the brush only, the side opposite to the handle.  4) There should be 16 rows (or 8 rings) of tufts (varies with brush size)  5) When you squeeze down on the brush you should hear it whistle or wheeze as the air flows out of the cushion and the cushion should bounce back at the same speed.  6) This is for the ruby brushes only- at first glance the plastic on the handle seems almost black, but when you hold it up against light, it glows a wonderful deep ruby red.  7) A drastic check is to pull out a small piece of the black bristle and set fire to it. The smell of singed hair would be clear or a plastic chemical odour would be the alternative.  8) Another drastic check, and this is really not necessary, is to take out the top of the pad and you will find a stamp on the plastic head inside.  I don&#x27;t know if all sellers on Amazon are selling authentic brushes but i believe this general guide can help customers interested in owning a Mason Pearson brush. One may wonder why Mason Pearson would suggest that these brushes are possibly fake? Well, for one, they have no way of knowing if these brushes have been obtained from their authorized seller in the US. And secondly, these brushes are being sold at a discounted price on Amazon, something that i believe the manufacturer does not approve of. Anyone spending 150-200$ on a brush deserves to know they own an authentic product and at the same time be able to take advantage of the discounts provided by sellers on Amazon. With Amazon&#x27;s excellent return policy, we have nothing to worry about.</li>
    <li> Love this brush and the handy little brush for cleaning.  I use the brush daily and it makes the styling of my hair so much easier.  I fully expect the brush to last me 20 or more years.</li>
    <li> I was debating between the B2 (Small Extra), the B3 (this one) and the B4 (pocket) and I am so glad I went with this handy one. I have very straight and coarse, thick Asian hair that gets oily and flat very quickly. That has led me to wash my hair daily and it&#x27;s a habit I can&#x27;t break even though I don&#x27;t necessarily think my hair looks worse for the wear with daily washing. The reason I purchased this brush is that I read it distributes the oils from your scalp to the ends of your hair and it makes your hair more voluminous at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially afraid of purchasing a boar bristle brush after a bad incident with a cheap-ish Conair boar bristle brush that led to my hair being consistently filled with static. That has not happened with this Mason Pearson one, except for a few occasions when I have on polyester/nylon clothing (like gym clothes). The handy B3 size is absolutely perfect for my jawline-length bob. This size will probably also work great if you have long but fine texture Caucasian hair but if you have coarse hair that is longer than say shoulder length, I would definitely recommend either the B1 or even the ones with the nylon/boar mix. Even though my hair is medium length, at the back of my head, where the hair is thicker, I have to brush in sections to make sure that the bristles get all the way to the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely adore this brush and wish I had bought it earlier - it seems pretty sturdy and well made. I untangle my hair with a wooden comb before using this brush and my hair has never looked healthier or bouncier. In fact, I just postponed an overdue haircut because my hair seemed like it didn&#x27;t even need a trim after two weeks of brushing day and night. It makes the hair fall so naturally and tucks in all the weird cowlicks. Along with a variety of Christophe Robin and John Masters Organics products, this brush is a must for anyone who wants luscious tresses!</li>
    <li> Great brush and excellent service.</li>
    <li> Mason Pearson products are the best ! great for all hair types, I&#x27;ve used their hairbrushes for 20 years and can never use any other brush.  My last brush lasted me for 15 years.  I go crazy if I misplace my brush, I  always make sure I keep a travel size in my purse!</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife and she loves it!  It was exactly as described and works perfectly! Thanks!  Will do business again soon!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter noticed the brush owned by my daughter,  her mother.  It was given as a gift sometime during her teen years.  She&#x27;s 40 now so it has obviously held up well.  I  had a faint recollection of the item when my grandchild told me the story.  Knowing of her interest how could I not provide one for her.  She is quite pleased with her Mason Pearson Brothers brush and delights in the luxury of owning it.</li>
    <li> Very nice presentation in the box as described with a brush for cleaning &amp; paperwork detailing use and care instructions.</li>
    <li> Well, I never thought I would spend so much money on a hair brush, but the reviews I read were so positive I thought I&#x27;d try it!  The brush came promptly and I started using it right away!  I&#x27;m hooked!  I love the way it makes my hair look! I have curly almost frizzy hair and I&#x27;m getting a real good shine and manageability .  I do the 100 brushes in the morning.  My scalp feels great and I love the way my natural oils in my hair  distributes!  Buy it, don&#x27;t hesitate!  It&#x27;s well worth the price for a quality  beauty item!</li>
    <li> Very good product. On seeing the brush at first I was doubtful whether the bristles were real boar as I have never seen real boar! So I did a test by snipping out one strand of bristle and burnt it. It burnt like hair turning into ash. The brush is actually very good, makes the hair bouncy and manageable at the same time. However, please note, pure bristle can be used only by people with fine hair. Shipment to India was quite speedy. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. Cheers!</li>
    <li> My husband ordered me this brush after I kept stealing his.  It is wonderfully gentle on my fine hair.  Now, if only I can steal his travel brush enough so that he orders me one of those, too.</li>
    <li> Fabulous, wonderful, have always wanted one and will treasure it.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect brush for people who take special care of their hair. This particular one is good for long, fine hair. My family also owns one that is good for long, thick hair. We each love the brush designed for our hair type.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush....my hair is thin and it gets oily and looks even thinner, but when I brushed it with the mason brush it distributes the oils I guess and it makes my hair immediately look fuller, and I feel my scalp stimulated.  Love it....&lt;br /&gt;Mildred</li>
    <li> Small purse brush.  These are the best hairbrushes and last forever</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand for years.  What a difference from a normal hair brush , definitely worth the extra.</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed with this product. The bristles are so soft your hardly know you are brushing your hair. It dies not perform well and I would not recommend it to anyone. I am sorry I wasted my money on this product</li>
