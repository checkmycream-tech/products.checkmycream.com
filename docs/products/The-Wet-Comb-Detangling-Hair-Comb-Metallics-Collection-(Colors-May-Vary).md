<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> not nearly as good as the wet brush it didn&#x27;t  get  the knots out made my hair more tangled and harder to brush</li>
    <li> I received a single comb.  I thought this was a &amp;#34;collection&amp;#34; as the picture shows.  I don&#x27;t see anywhere that it says only 1 comb.  I would never pay $7.05 for a single comb.</li>
    <li> I have lots of very very fine, wavy hair that tends to curl into a messy knot of frizzy madness. Combatting the tangle is always a frustrating, often a painful task. My daughter also was blessed or possibly cursed with the same type of untamed tresses.  Although beautiful when tamed this task for her is often filled with tears. I have tried many brushes and combs to be left with a pile of knotted hair that was painfully tugged out. These combs however live up to their hype. My daughter is 6 and actually combs/fixes her hair thanks to the magical ease these combs go through her hair. Although not as perfect as commercials show, these are the best I have used for untangling the knots and not just ripping the unruly hair out!</li>
    <li> We have had really good luck with the wet brush and thought we would try the wet comb.  My daughter has really thick hair and the handle broke off the second time we used it.</li>
    <li> This comb really helps remove tangles in long thick hair when wet. Does not work so well on dry hair but no worse than any other comb.</li>
    <li> This was a gift. It is loved!</li>
    <li> The brush is cute and works well. It gets through my long thick hair pretty easily and is painless.  The down side is the rubber handle pulls off sometimes.  This annoyance is why I only gave it 3 stars. I do not think I will be rebuying these when I need new combs.</li>
    <li> Not quite like the brush, I love the brush but not sure abut this comb got tangled up in my hair.</li>
    <li> I really like the design and since my grandchildren gave a thumbs up to the shower brush, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It didn&#x27;t work as well as my cheap drugstore purchase so I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter, who always has knots like a Rapunzel on a windy day. It does work well with detailer spray, however she much prefers the Wet Brush over the comb.</li>
    <li> Not like the brush at all. Unfortunately not a good buy for our household. Comb is thick and has some weight to it. Feels like it will break as I try to comb my daughter&#x27;s hair with it. I tried it on my hair and it actually hurts and is not much different from a regular comb. If you are looking for something that works try the wet brush abd leave this alone.</li>
    <li> again just what I thought it was</li>
    <li> The Wet Comb is great for my tangly hair, I would have given it yet another star if the handle was just a bit bigger.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my three-year-old&#x27;s curly, easily tangled hair. She loves it so much she asks to brush her hair now.</li>
    <li> Bought as gift. Was hoping for a metallic color but just received black. So disappointed with that but hope it&#x27;s okay with giftee. Don&#x27;t have time to return .</li>
    <li> Nice comb!!!!&lt;br /&gt;perfect for long hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;Good item and good price!&lt;br /&gt;I also bought The Wet Brush.&lt;br /&gt;All items were the same color.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it!</li>
    <li> Great comb for thinning hair, as it doesn&#x27;t drag through.  Good size to keep in shower - not too big.</li>
    <li> Good quality product. Arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> When I pay full price for a product, I don&#x27;t expect to get a factory second.  Yes, the comb worked, but only half of it received a proper &amp;#34;metallic&amp;#34; paint job.  I would never have been sold this item in my salon...unless it was identified as a factory second, and discounted.  Next time, I&#x27;ll buy directly from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> First time using it and the handle came off!!! I didn&#x27;t believe the other reviews but should have. Do not buy this!! The brush option from this same company is wonderful so I just assumed this would be too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this come will work very well but I did not realize it would be so huge. I would prefer a smaller one for straight hair. MORE INFORMATION: I had a very curly wig sent to me by mistake (ordered straight). The curls were tangled and this comb would not untangle the curls. Lost a handful of fake hair trying to do so.</li>
    <li> I love it, great for long hair!!!!</li>
    <li> But the wet brush works far better!  The comb is a bit flimsy and doesn&#x27;t get through the tangles as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this comb on a 7 year old, with long, curly hair. It works just as well as other combs. As a bonus, it looks neat.</li>
    <li> The comb is very disappointing.  It works well but snapped in two after only a few uses.</li>
    <li> What can you say about a comb?  I have very fine, permed hair that tends to snarl in places.  This comb is perfect.  It has widely spaced teeth that are very smooth so there is no damage to my hair.  It&#x27;s a good size - not huge, but comfortable to hold and not flimsey.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product. What I actually received was a 25 cent comb and not what is advertised. I&#x27;d give this no stars but I wanted to be able to comment. Junk!</li>
    <li> This comb is sturdy and does detangle my hair while wet or dry. The curve makes it comfortable to use. The only suggestion I have is the product could be a little larger. What I mean is a few more teeth on the comb and a longer handle. That&#x27;s just a personal preference.</li>
    <li> Very Nice Comb!  My hair is long and this comb does not break my hair off like so many combs do.</li>
    <li> I love the &#x27;wetbrush&#x27; and bought he comb for that reason. The comb is not a good detangler at all! I definitely DON&#x27;T recommend!</li>
    <li> I like this comb very much. Will use it in combination with the wet brush. It is large and I may order another one to use for combing out the mane and tail of my horses since the combs you can buy for equine care are very flimsy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this comb because I comb my hair often when it is wet and thought the purchase made sense. I have had the comb less than TWO WEEKS- after dropping it twice during that time (everyone drops their combs), three of the prongs have completely broken off. Also, while combing my hair it snapped from the base. My hair isn&#x27;t even that thick! I attached a picture of this sad excuse for a comb. I do not recommend this comb to anyone.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described. Was given as a gift &amp; loved. :)</li>
    <li> My daughter has very thick hair, the idea is a great concept however poor design/quality. Snapped in half the very first use of me trying to work a tangle out of my daughters thick hair and I was being careful to work the tangle out, might work fine on thinner hair? Returned for a refund and actually lost money due to shipping recoupment to send it back ! would not recommend you try unless you find a local retailer and can take it back directly if this happens to you.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once but it worked great!!</li>
    <li> The comb worked great on getting the tangles out of my girls hair. The handle came apart from the comb after the 2nd use.</li>
    <li> Works great! I have fine hair so it tangles easily especially when wet!! This come goes right through without detangler!</li>
    <li> My kids love these (I dont have enough hair to use it) but my girls do and they say it is the best ever!</li>
    <li> this item is terrible, I wouldn&#x27;t even give it one star. it rips your hair out. it looks pretty, and that&#x27;s about it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone. don&#x27;t waste your money like I did. money I couldn&#x27;t afford but thought if it got rid of knots easy it would be worth it. it doesn&#x27;t. it doesn&#x27;t detangle.</li>
    <li> This is the best shower comb I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair or pull it out even when it&#x27;s wet!</li>
    <li> Another wonderful product from the makers of Wet brush. Wet comb is great for the shower to comb my shampoo through my wet hair without breakage and then I can turn and use it on my dried hair as well. Versatile must have for your hair</li>
    <li> Was skeptical at first, but discovered this does work exactly as advertised! And even more importantly: My wife loved this!</li>
    <li> I really liked this comb when I first received it.  Then the handle broke :(  I&#x27;m sad that it has this flaw.  Keeping me from ordering another.</li>
    <li> Works ok. The handle broke pretty easily (the outer grip black part unglued from the plastic inner part. Still usable but annoying. It may have broken because I use it in the shower, so maybe the glue doesn&#x27;t stand up well to moisture and heat?</li>
    <li> Although this is a good detangler comb, there are a couple of things I don&#x27;t like. One, the handle fell off the second time I used it, and two, the contour of the bottom of the comb means that there&#x27;s usually a corner sticking in to your head somewhere. I wish it had a flat, straight edge on the bottom. So good on the pain free detangling, but the drawbacks limit it&#x27;s usefulness for me and I&#x27;ll probably just go back to a regular comb.</li>
    <li> Nice size, easy to grip, combs through long, thick hair with ease. Not the best to use for parting since its curved. And its purple!</li>
    <li> I bought this comb because my wet brush changed my life. I have a ton of long thin hair. I had high hopes for the comb since it shares a name with the brush, but I should have just brought another brush. This comb isn&#x27;t any better than any other pick.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing comb I have ever used!  I have told so many people about this comb because I love it so much!!  I absolutely love the entire &amp;#34;wet brush&amp;#34; set!  They are all amazing!</li>
    <li> My hair is 4a, and my shrinkage is so bad so my ends get tangled easily. Does a nice job at detangling my ends. Afterwards I can run my fingers through my hair with ease.The handle has a nice grip especially if you use it while having conditioner or water in your hair. I wish the handle was stronger because after the first use I feel that it might break, and the comb isnt that big. I would recommend this over a straight tooth comb.</li>
    <li> I would definitely not recommend this to anyone,  the comb broke in half on about the third use....lovely.  Seller was a fast shipper tho... lol</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that it would detangle my hair. I have thick 4C hair and it detangled my thick hair with very minimal shedding. There was hardly any hair loss. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Had high hopes for this comb since the Wet &amp;#34;Brush&amp;#34; works absolutely great. Unfortunately, the handle snapped in half and broke during very first use. Terribly made product. Do not buy this comb.</li>
    <li> Also a great gift for wives who complain about how hard it is to comb/brush their hair.  Hopefully this will reduce the number of brushes I have to buy in the coming year, ha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically does the job; the handle could be a bit more substantial, like OXO good grips (kids and the ladies would appreciate that).  Then you could market it to the elderly too.</li>
    <li> this is not a good design. I had and sued it for two weeks before the handle broke off as I was brushing my hair afterI got out of the shower. The comb part itself still works, but the handle was tossed in the garbage</li>
    <li> it didnt help or take away of my already existing difficulty of combing my blond highlighted wet hair or dry hair.  i wouldnt throw it away but it hasnt really helped much.</li>
    <li> I have very curly, frizzy, brittle, dry hair. This is the best comb I&#x27;ve found to comb out after shower and shampoo and moisturizer. Only one that doesn&#x27;t pull out a handful of hair:))</li>
    <li> We bought this for our long haired dog to help with tangles, it worked so well we all purchased one for everyone in the family. Great comb!</li>
    <li> works on my daughter&#x27;s hair which knots easy.</li>
    <li> It really does work!! I have thick course wavy hair and the comb easily glided through it!! It detangled my hair so perfectly I would recommend to anyone with any type of hair!</li>
    <li> The handle broke on this comb after only a few uses. It also smelled like gasoline when I opened it; it was very nauseating.</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy this comb if you have hair longer than four inches.  The handle broke (snapped in two) the first time I tried to use it.  The picture is deceptive, the handle is actually two parts.  The plastic comes from the teeth part and gets rather skinny &amp; small to fit inside of the plastic end.  The plastic snapped 1 cm inside the handle.  You are better off buying a $2 regular comb from the drug store because the entire comb is one piece and the handle won&#x27;t snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - this product is advertised as &amp;#34;Metallics Collection (Colors May Vary)&amp;#34; - the one that arrived was not from the Metallics Collection at all (it was solid black, aka the original comb).</li>
    <li> It does the job*[Nice Handle, cool color, and versatile, I gave it 3 stars because its on the smaller side for a detangling comb!</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers, the comb snapped in half after only a few uses on my medium length, thick hair.</li>
    <li> No more tangled hair.  Love this product. Hugs from grandchildren.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it but more importantly my 5 &amp; 6 year olds love it!</li>
    <li> This comb works wonderfully for children with long hair.  They no longer fight as you pull this comb through their wet (or dry) hair.</li>
    <li> I use this on my permed hair and my daughters straight/fine hair and it works great on both of us!</li>
    <li> I like for myself I have thick curly hair to my mid back.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has long thick hair down to her butt.&lt;br /&gt;We both used once we put conditioner in our hair.&lt;br /&gt;I loved it.  It combed out my tangles very nice and gently.&lt;br /&gt;My daughters comb broke the first time she used it.</li>
    <li> Wow!  As with all Wet Brush products, this comb delivers!  It works perfectly to detangle wet hair.  I have medium length hair that is fine.  My hair loves to be a tangled mess no matter how gentle I am when washing it.  I also have a LOT of hair even though it is fine.  This comb easily penetrates to the scalp, unlike most combs I have used.  I also use this comb to comb through leave in conditioner or a conditioning hair mask and it works perfectly.  There is no hair pulling, eye watering or much hair in the comb after use.  I can be tender headed and this comb is wonderful.  It also works well on dry hair although most of my experience with it is using it on wet hair.  I highly recommend this comb if you are looking to protect your hair from damage and breakage from combing, are tender headed or have a lot of hair that tangles easily.</li>
    <li> This comb is awesome and friendly to my long hair.</li>
    <li> Handle bends with big tangles</li>
    <li> This comb is awesome for my eight year old boy (who wears his hair a little long) but I cannot get it through my thick, long hair.  I gave it four stars because I can comb my kids hair without getting hung up on snags -- it really does help him.  The teeth are very close together, consider that as it is not for everyone!</li>
    <li> I like this comb...But I have very long hair and sometimes it feels slightly flimsy as if it might break when I am pulling it threw tangles.  So far so good tho :)</li>
    <li> My niece just loves these combs. SHe screamed when combing hair. Now she combs it herself.</li>
    <li> I HATE this comb. I LOVE the wet BRUSH and bought brushes for a lot of my friends/family for a stocking stuffer because the brushes are so great. The comb is terrible!! it&#x27;s super stiff. It hurts my daughters long curly/frizzy hair when her hair is wet or dry. Don&#x27;t buy the comb.</li>
    <li> The comb design itself is great. It&#x27;s exactly what I expected. But the handle came off in less than two days of very, very light use. It just pulled off. We LOVE our wet brush; it truly is one of those plain great products. I had similar expectations for the comb. In theory, it&#x27;s a good product. I don&#x27;t know if I received a defect, but I&#x27;m disappointed in the craftsmanship.</li>
    <li> Upon the recommendation of the salesperson, I bought one of these at a beauty store for my daughters with long, fine hair which (in the past) takes 10-15 minutes of agonizing brushing with detangler every morning to get them ready for school.  It works great on wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use it to &amp;#34;comb in&amp;#34; the conditioner during bath times. We just apply the conditioner, comb out any tangles from scalp to waist (they are growing it to donate to &amp;#34;Locks of Love&amp;#34;) and then rinse.  Combing it again out of the tub while still damp then takes only a couple of minutes.  In general, we feel that it has made their hair more manageable between baths as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to start at the ends and work your way to toward the scalp.  I also found that if I hold the comb perpendicular to the scalp it works much better.  Combing through with any sort of &amp;#34;angle of attack&amp;#34; on the comb invites snags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a parent, this is a great time-saver.  My daughters love that it doesn&#x27;t pull as much our brushes did AND that hair-time is shorter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We haven&#x27;t used it on dry hair, but now instead of de-tanglers, we just spray water on their hair and comb through any tangles.</li>
    <li> I like the comb OK. Was not a flexible comb as I had hoped. It works well. Wish you could pick your color I go the gray one. Would have picked something more colorful. Delivery was quick and seller is good.</li>
    <li> The comb is a great detangler.  I&#x27;m sure I should have looked more closely, but this item popped up as an add on when I was ordering a Wet Brush and I clicked to buy it because it seemed like such a good deal for 4 combs.  Only when only once comb arrived did I realize that the picture of 4 combs is to display the possible choices.  You only get one comb.  It isn&#x27;t like it is crazy expensive, just not what I expected.</li>
    <li> The Wet Comb was cool when I saw it, I use it for the first time and it is really nice on your hair, great product</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would work on my granddaughter&#x27;s really curly hair, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the brush we use.  Might be fine for thick straight hair, but not thick and curly.</li>
    <li> Does not detangle.  All my cheaper brushes and combs do better than this.  Not as advertised.  I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> OK. Not my favorite :(</li>
    <li> This works. The wet brush is great too.</li>
    <li> I love the Wet Brush!!!!  This does not work:(</li>
    <li> I have fairly thick hair and needed something a little more sturdy.  This is it.  It glides through hair very easily.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> nice addition to my wet brush.</li>
    <li> My 5yo child has hair below her bottom, and her whining decreased dramatically after I started using this comb.</li>
    <li> Perfect for curly, wet hair!</li>
    <li> My hair loves this comb! Its probably one of the best detangling combs I&#x27;ve ever used. The grip on the handle is great because I doesn&#x27;t slide out of your hand, even when its all covered in conditioner. I have plans to buy another one just as a back up.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like any other comb. Doesn&#x27;t measure up to the Wet Brush at all. The Wet Brush is something that is absolutely phenomenal!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter in law....she llikes it for her very long wet hair.  The company delivered as promised &amp; I would certainly would do business with them again.</li>
    <li> I still get knots I cannot get out when using the comb,&lt;br /&gt;I use conditioner, so it should slide thru my hair. but works better then a regular comb</li>
    <li> I have very thick course hair - this comb goes right through it without tearing it out. Just love it!!!</li>
    <li> I got this comb for my 21/2 year old daughter who hated having her hair combed. She would scream and fight. With the comb however she has stopped screaming and is willing to have her hair combed. It is wonderful. I also found myself going into her room to use it. I have very long ( to my butt) hair that is very think and tires to be curly but to the length is weighted down. It gets very knotted and it used to take me 1-2 hours to untangle it, but with the comb I can do it in less than 10 minutes. I love it so much I have ordered one for myself and 1 for my 1 1/2 years daughter with very curly hair.</li>
    <li> Only reason s not getting 5 stars: as pine member is supposed to be 2 day ship free it took 6. And it was supposed to be purple that is color I ordered and it was silver but is a phenomenal feta glee comb for my thick long hair!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair. Not wavy, thick curly hair. This comb does exactly what it says it does, and the size and shape are perfect. I keep it in my shower.</li>
    <li> The handle snapped right in two the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> I bought theses at the recommendation of my stylist. I have only seen these at salons and was always impressed by the ease in which they combed through my fine knotty hair. This did not disappoint; I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I like the comb for my wet hair better than the brush.</li>
    <li> I have extremely fine hair.  Combine that with hard water at home and you have one tangled mess in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at first, however, I was pleasantly surprised. I am super rushed in the mornings and I have spent 10 minutes at times trying to detangle my hair.  This comb really works!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to all my fine haired friends.</li>
    <li> We love the wet brush but this comb version broke in half after only a few times of use.  :(</li>
    <li> Great Comb but because of the design of the handle it breaks very easily</li>
    <li> Broke the second time I used it.  Combed well, just to fragile for it&#x27;s intended use.</li>
    <li> Not thrilled at all with this purchase. I love the Wet Brush, so I thought this would be great--I was so wrong. I used it one time and it broke. Also, it wasn&#x27;t a metallic color, it was black. Not a big deal if it worked, but again, it broke immediately.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t yank on hair and is very gentle for hair loss patients. However, this comb does not comb very well and I needed to use s regular comb after</li>
    <li> helps get the tangles out very well</li>
    <li> The wet comb is nice, but I truly prefer the wet brush.  It is the best brush you can buy that doesn&#x27;t hurt your head when you comb your hair after washing it.  The comb is good, but I prefer the brush.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the wet brush, but still it is great!</li>
    <li> I did really like this comb until the handle fell off.  I tried to glue it back on but it didn&#x27;t work. :(  The vendor made it exceedingly challenging to get a new one which i never did.  I just gave up and found another product that detangles wet hair.</li>
    <li> Item as described, received on time.</li>
    <li> There is something weird about the handle which has always seemed a bit loose. Otherwise fine at detangling. Certainly better than plastic.</li>
    <li> My hair is falling our right now, so I was keen to find a comb that i could use to get tangles out without \\&quot;pulling on my hair\\&quot;.  This one does the trick.  It works great on dry hair too.</li>
    <li> Cute color, but the comb itself feels a bit flimsy and it doesn&#x27;t live up to the description on the packaging as far as how easily it will comb the hair.  It doesn&#x27;t easily comb short, straight hair, let along long, curly hair.  I&#x27;m not very happy with the purchase.  The Wet Brush on the other hand is amazing!</li>
