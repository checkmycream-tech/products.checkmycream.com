    <li> Great scent ! Camphory...... later fades into floral. I hated it initially but later grew on to me. Gonna order again soon. Everyone in my lab recognizes it and it TRULY lasts. Great for the price and the packaging was perfect. It is a good \\&quot; pick me up\\&quot; on bad days, A whiff of it helps me feel energized. The packaging is convenient enough to carry in flights from Boston to LA. Very fall/winter/spring.</li>
