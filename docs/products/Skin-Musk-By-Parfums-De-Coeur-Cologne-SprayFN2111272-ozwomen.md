      <li>skin musk is so feminine and clean smelling and stays with you for most of the day...</li>
      <li>I receive many comments on how fresh and clean it smells.  </li>
      <li>I have three words to describe this fragrance fresh, clean and innocent; you never tire of the fragrance just as you never tire of the fresh feeling after a shower.</li>

      <li>I use it lightly for a quick trip out the door.      </li>
      <li>just the right amount of allure!</li>

      <li>I think it smells very different than the original Bonne Bell version.  </li>
      <li>Other perfumes that I have tried are too strong and when applying it, I always had to spray it into the air and walk into it</li>
      <li>I expected this to be more musky and to last longer.  </li>
      <li>Years ago I got a small sample bottle of this cologne and never have been able to find it since.</li>
      <li>I am 52 years old</li>

    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite scent on me. I love it too...</li>
    <li> skin musk is so feminine and clean smelling and stays with you for most of the day...i&#x27;ve been wearing this for years,falling in love with the smell when one of my students came in to my office with this on and will wear it until it isnt made anymore if that ever happens...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent forever!  I love it because it has a very light musk fragrance.  Not at all overpowering.  It seems to last most of the day for me.  Other perfumes that I have tried are too strong and when applying it, I always had to spray it into the air and walk into it otherwise it was too much!  Not with SKIN. Spray it on and ENJOY!  I also use the body spray and the oil!</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff. Been using it for 15 years.</li>
    <li> I have purdhased this cologne for years.  This is the BEST cologne EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I hope it is around forever!!!!!!!!!! I have three words to describe this fragrance fresh, clean and innocent; you never tire of the fragrance just as you never tire of the fresh feeling after a shower.</li>
    <li> I ordered 4 bottles of Skin perfume from Parfumes de Coeur, who now makes the product.  I think it smells very different than the original Bonne Bell version.  So does my husband, who noticed it right away.  I am very disappointed, as I still have 3 1/2 bottles to use......</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S MY FAVORITE SCENT. SOMETIMES I HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING IT. I WASHAPPY TO FIND IT HERE. THE PRICE WAS RIGHT.</li>
    <li> Years ago I got a small sample bottle of this cologne and never have been able to find it since. I love this scent. It smells so clean and I get positive comments everytime I wear it. They ask me what it is and I tell them SKIN. It&#x27;s wonderful. Thanks</li>
    <li> I am an asmatic and found that Skin is the only fragrance that I can use without wheezing!  What a godsend!  I have been using this product for over 20 years!  I receive many comments on how fresh and clean it smells.  When I am asked what do I have on...I say SKIN! I was having trouble finding the spray and the lotion.  Still could not find the lotion, but thank goodness I found the spray.  This site will go on my \\&quot;favorite places\\&quot; for sure!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Audrey</li>
    <li> My wife loves this subtle fragrance...just the right amount of allure!</li>
    <li> I am 52 years old and I started wearing this as a teen, well, the oil anyway, but I love the spray too.  For the price you just can&#x27;t beat it.  I love musk and I love florals and sandalwood so it was just perfect for me.  I wore it 35 years ago and rediscovered it today and it is absolutely as wonderful as it was back then which is why it has been around for so long.  I plan to wear it for everyday and then use my more expensive perfume like D&amp;G&#x27;s Light Blue or DKNY&#x27;s Be Delicious for special occasions.   Skin Musk is absolutely a timeless classic!!</li>
    <li> Love Skin! Have for many years. Glad I can still purchase it. Many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> This cologne is my sister&#x27;s favorite. I buy them for her and send them to Japan once a year.</li>
    <li> I have loved and used this perfume for years... People love it on me!!! Please Don&#x27;t stop making this fragrance!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what your missing!</li>
    <li> I never fail to get a compliment when I wear this fragrance.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve been a &amp;#34;Skin&amp;#34; user for many years.</li>
    <li> I received my order in just a few days. It was packaged very good so &lt;br /&gt;the glass was not able to break. I was very happy with my order and the  &lt;br /&gt;quick delivery. Thank you, Patty</li>
    <li> I expected this to be more musky and to last longer.  It&#x27;s very weak and it only lasts a few hours.</li>
    <li> I  have used this cologne for years, but can no longer purchase it locally.  I am so happy that you have located it for me.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this oil..the best around!!!</li>
    <li> Great fragrance.  I use it lightly for a quick trip out the door.      I also use it in my bathroom once in a while to scent the tissue or valance.  Beautiful.    I use it in my closet to bring that sweet and gentle fragrance to my space, and I use it in my shoes.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best perfume for me. I get compliments all the time saying how I smell so good. Then they will ask what kind of perfume.</li>
    <li> I buy this perfume for my mother in law each year, she loves it.  It has a nice soft scent.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite perfume for many years, but it is hard to find.  You can get it in some stores, but they like to lock it up.  I don&#x27;t like spending time for a salesperson to unlock it for me.  Easier to just order it here!!</li>
    <li> First gave it to my wife while working on my doctorate in 1970.  Have never see it locally.  Both she and I love the fragrance.  The ad said Prince Machibelli (Spelling?), but it arrived in a Bonnie Bell box. After 38 years do we remember if it smells the same?  Nope!  But  she smells as great as she looks, and for an octogenarian, she is a knockout!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grant</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this fragrance when younger and it is still smelling very good.  I would recommend</li>
    <li> Love this. Brings back memories of my teenage years in the late 80s early 90s back when it was Bonnie Bell. Not long-lasting, I use it for the nostalgia factor.</li>
