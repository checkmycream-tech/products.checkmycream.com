      <li>i love it!!!!</li>
      <li>Very good pins,strong and not bending.</li>
      <li>They are great for buns and updos and are probably best for hair that is shoulder length or longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Although the price was great, the product is way to thin/ flimsy for my hair (and it&#x27;s baby-fine).  </li>

      <li>good quality.  </li>

      <li>good price and keep my hair pinned well.</li>

      <li>Nice assortment of sizes.</li>
      <li>But these were just perfect thanks</li>
      <li>Nothing spectacular</li>
      <li>So if you are a dancer and need to find good hair pins, these will work fine and they wont cost you an \\&quot;arm and a leg\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>You gotta love the fact that this has three sizes.</li>

      <li>then order some more.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Wish I paid more attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love that they come in a variety of sizes.</li>
      <li>But I haven&#x27;t been able to find those.</li>
      <li>otherwise it takes twice as many to hold my hair.</li>
      <li>I love them and I can exercise and do updos for weddings and events without worrying about my hair falling out.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t mind buying more</li>
      <li>Love the different lengths to get the perfect protective styles while transitioning.  </li>
      <li>If you are a noob like me, please make sure</li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t even able to tighten them.</li>
      <li>These are better that ones from Wal-Mart</li>
      <li>and it does a very good job keeping my hair at its place especially when working on the kitchen</li>
      <li>Very quick delivery.  </li>
      <li>Works well and strong</li>
      <li>Or just buy both kinds, they are so cheap.</li>
      <li>and so I keep pins on hand to secure my students hair in buns.  </li>
      <li>These pins bend  out of shape just like the cheap ones  .</li>
      <li>they are cheap</li>
      <li>they have different sizes and it really helps hold my hair in the bun, love this!!!</li>
      <li>ACCOUNT***&lt;br /&gt;I bought these pins at a beauty supply store and they are pretty much have a good strength and stay in the hair.</li>
      <li>anyways, worth to buy!</li>
      <li>This package is great because it offers a variety of sizes AND these pins are much stronger than the whimpy ones you find at the drug/grocery store.</li>
      <li>The price was right and the quality is fine, but I wish the size difference between the large and medium pins was more significant.</li>
      <li>its good for the price.i like it because it comes in different sizes.i recommend and will order again.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are sturdy and smooth, and the balls rarely fall off.</li>
      <li>The good thing is just the fact that it comes in different sizes.</li>
      <li>So I gave 4 stars because it&#x27;s not bad</li>
      <li>Other than that they are great.</li>
      <li>Luckily, this does not affect the way the hairpins work</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly; the assorted sizes are useful.</li>
      <li>The end of the product is not made right.  </li>
      <li>They do the job and the price is right.</li>
      <li>These are much better than other hair pins I&#x27;ve tried, and are super cheap as well.</li>
      <li>They hold the hair great, the only thing that I don&#x27;t care for is that the paint has started coming off of the pins after about the fourth use.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for strong pins like we had in the old days...</li>
      <li>(The paint chips aren&#x27;t easily removed from my natural afro textured hair.)  </li>
      <li>These works great for any size hot roller, better then the crappy clips provided in expensive &amp;#34; professional&amp;#34; hot roller kits.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
      <li>I love this pack of three different sizes.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>They all hold pretty damn well.</li>
      <li>I can do a French twist with 2 or 3 pins instead do more than 20 bobby pins.</li>
      <li>I am a professional stylist and I really like strong and reliable products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I mean, why else buy hair pins except that all of the ones you HAD disappeared lol</li>
      <li>I like how this pack comes with more than one available size since certain parts of my hair such as my bangs are obviously shorter.</li>
      <li>The biggest in this pack are perfect for long thick hair.</li>
      <li>Pins work great, but the black paint flecks off in only a couple of wears.  </li>
      <li>I should know I just paid 100 bucks for a system and the clips broke leaving me to turn to these handy little things.</li>
      <li>The one I want are a much thicker material.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;&#x27;l use them till they peel too much</li>
      <li>I really wish these came in a resealable storage container like the bobby pins.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re very sturdy too.</li>
      <li>Came fast.</li>
      <li>Works really well.</li>
      <li>shipping was fast</li>
      <li>Works great for long hair, holds really well with just a few needed....</li>
      <li>Loved the assorted sizes, the only problem is the black paint chips off.  </li>
      <li>it is a good product, and holds hair tight with different sizes of pins.&lt;br /&gt;i thought i will need it but its way too much,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
      <li>I bought these hair pins thinking it might&#x27;ve held better than your typical ones</li>
      <li>but I wish that they kept their shiny black paint better.</li>
      <li>Not much to say about bobby pins, they&#x27;re pretty cool... just need to figure out how to use them now</li>
      <li>The description wasn&#x27;t particular about which type of pins</li>
      <li>The problem is they are very flimsy compared to the old ones I have which I think are the Soft &#x27;N Style brand.</li>
      <li>They were cheap, but not worth it.</li>
      <li>These are great pins for my long, thick hair!</li>
      <li>Also the color fades very  quickly so they are not really black, they are silver with black painted over it.</li>
      <li>They are easy to use and hold firmly without bending.</li>
      <li>these are super wide</li>
      <li>Hair pins are not for certain bobby pin uses- eg, they won&#x27;t work for holding rollers or wrap sets, and if you are looking for something to use essentially as a barrette (eg.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These pins bend  out of shape just like the cheap ones  . I was disappointed. I have thick hair and when I put them in my bun they held ok, but when I took them out at night, they were all bent out of shape. Un-usable again... I was looking for strong pins like we had in the old days... These are junk.</li>
    <li> its good for the price.i like it because it comes in different sizes.i recommend and will order again. shipping was fast</li>
    <li> Works well and strong</li>
    <li> I bought these hair pins thinking it might&#x27;ve held better than your typical ones but it&#x27;s no different. So I gave 4 stars because it&#x27;s not bad but it just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> These are open ended pins,so they aren&#x27;t tight and I have to bend them to use them otherwise it takes twice as many to hold my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a ballet teacher and so I keep pins on hand to secure my students hair in buns.  This package is great because it offers a variety of sizes AND these pins are much stronger than the whimpy ones you find at the drug/grocery store. I still don&#x27;t think that they are as good as the 3\\&quot; pins that Goody sold years ago. But I haven&#x27;t been able to find those. So if you are a dancer and need to find good hair pins, these will work fine and they wont cost you an \\&quot;arm and a leg\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I love this pack of three different sizes. You get a lot and it will last a long time. Hair pins never last and there are lots in here...I don&#x27;t worry about running out every month and running around to buy more.  They do the job and the price is right.</li>
    <li> I was pretty disappointed when I got these pins because the distance between the two arms is so wide. Compared to other hair pins out there, this one is lacking because of that. I would only recommend this product to someone with thick hair.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get these hairpins! They do not work, their mouth is far too wide for any hair to stay in place. Maybe I should have known the difference between a bobby pin and a hair pin better, but the only time I would use these is in big updos, not a quick fix, which I often need.</li>
    <li> These hair pins are just what&#x27;s needed to attach my hair pieces to my head. They come in small, medium and large sizes. A different size for each job</li>
    <li> love that it has 3 sizes and very good quality</li>
    <li> I like that the pins come in different lengths and sizes. They all hold pretty damn well.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for all kinds of hairstyles, though i used them mostly for buns. I love that they come in a variety of sizes. I purchased these over a year ago and still have plenty left!</li>
    <li> i love it!!!! they have different sizes and it really helps hold my hair in the bun, love this!!! if your a dancer, buy this</li>
    <li> The biggest in this pack are perfect for long thick hair.</li>
    <li> arrived b4 expected.  good quality.  solid.  thick wire.  does the job.  yes, I&#x27;d buy it again.  and recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Fast shipping!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very good pins,strong and not bending.</li>
    <li> Thank you Thank you. What great assortment of hair pins for every occasion.&lt;br /&gt;Just enough for your need. Thank you.</li>
    <li> good price and keep my hair pinned well.</li>
    <li> A lot of the reviewers here don&#x27;t know how to use hair pins, or thought they were bobby pins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair pins are open ended. You slide it in a little, then turn and slide it the other direction. They are non-damaging, unlike bobby pins which rub against your hair, causing damage. Hair pins are not for certain bobby pin uses- eg, they won&#x27;t work for holding rollers or wrap sets, and if you are looking for something to use essentially as a barrette (eg. holding back a piece of hair near your face), you will probably want bobby pins. They are great for buns and updos and are probably best for hair that is shoulder length or longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are sturdy and smooth, and the balls rarely fall off. However, the black coating does wear off with time, but this doesn&#x27;t affect the performance. These are much better than other hair pins I&#x27;ve tried, and are super cheap as well.</li>
    <li> I never write review for any product, but it is so terrible I had to.&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine and thin hair. The end of the product is not made right.  It does not hold any hair at all and the pin keeps falling off (not that it was clip-able to start with).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you zoom in the picture, you will see that the end has a much bigger gap than a regular pin. Wish I paid more attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy it if you only want to secure little amount of hair.</li>
    <li> This pins do not hold your hair up. They&#x27;re very wide open and I wasn&#x27;t even able to tighten them.</li>
    <li> Even the longest pins do not hold my hair in place at all!!!  And I don&#x27;t have very long or very thick hair!</li>
    <li> Not much to say on these. If you need bobby pins then you found em. Nothing spectacular but they get the job done.</li>
    <li> I have never used pins that the black coating and the rounded ends of the pins fade a way and comes off. This is definitely an inferior product and I will not used these pins in my hair ever again. I advise Amazon to not sale this product because it&#x27;s not healthy for anyone&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Works great for long hair, holds really well with just a few needed....I loved them...then, they started peeling...oh well....just hair pins they are cheap so I&#x27;&#x27;l use them till they peel too much then order some more.</li>
    <li> This pins were of better quality than I was anticipating! They are really sturdy and hold my hair up great! I have really long hair that&#x27;s kinda thick, so that&#x27;s saying something when I don&#x27;t have to use 20 pins to keep it in place. Also this seller was prompt about sending out my order, so that was a plus too!</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting at all. I have been looking for some that are about the length of the longest ones but these weren&#x27;t it. The one I want are a much thicker material. These are better that ones from Wal-Mart but they slide out almost as bad. They did arrive in a very timely manner so nothing bad to say about who sent them.</li>
    <li> I use these almost daily and noticed that the coating comes off. Which means that I have a bunch of little black specs in my hair from the coating.</li>
    <li> I really wish these came in a resealable storage container like the bobby pins. My only complaint. They work well and SEEM to be well enough coated that they won&#x27;t rust and start pulling my hair. If only I didn&#x27;t have to buy a container to store them in :( I guess that&#x27;s the plan...I mean, why else buy hair pins except that all of the ones you HAD disappeared lol</li>
    <li> These 3 inch sturdy hair pins are very hard to find - they are not in stores.  They hold the hair great, the only thing that I don&#x27;t care for is that the paint has started coming off of the pins after about the fourth use.  Other than that they are great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a novice when it comes to my hair... I basically switch from hair down and hair up in a ponytail.  But I&#x27;m attending a wedding in a couple weeks and have been binge watching hair tutorials on YouTube, and I realized &amp;#34;I need hair pins!&amp;#34;  I bought these and they are great. However, I did not know the difference between hair pins and bobby pins, so I also had to go out and buy those. If you are a noob like me, please make sure you know the difference and know which ones you need.  Or just buy both kinds, they are so cheap.</li>
    <li> it is a good product, and holds hair tight with different sizes of pins.&lt;br /&gt;i thought i will need it but its way too much,&lt;br /&gt;but anyways, worth to buy!</li>
    <li> These pins are good quality and sturdy and does the job. Good for keeping an updo in place even with difficult to manage hair.</li>
    <li> Terrific HAIR pins! They do everything I need. Can&#x27;t beat the price either. Agreed with other reviewers that there seems to be some confusion over the difference between a &amp;#34;bobby pin&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;hair pin&amp;#34;. These are HAIR pins. As such, they work fantastically.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Came fast. No troubles. The price is unbeatable. Recommend buying these rather that the ones from the beauty stores.</li>
    <li> Not too bad, not too great either... It&#x27;s bigger than what I expected. It doesn&#x27;t hold my hair that long.</li>
    <li> These are great pins for my long, thick hair! I love them and I can exercise and do updos for weddings and events without worrying about my hair falling out. However after a couple uses, the paint chips off and so do the &amp;#34;protective tips&amp;#34; on the ends. So they don&#x27;t last very long. They are a good value so I don&#x27;t mind buying more but I wish that they kept their shiny black paint better.</li>
    <li> cheap quality pins, not worth it! they are very thin&lt;br /&gt;spend the extra money to get the more expensive ones</li>
    <li> Great hair pins! Their shape helps hold any hairdo with dry or damp hair.</li>
    <li> ***I&#x27;M USING MY DADS AMAZON ACCOUNT***&lt;br /&gt;I bought these pins at a beauty supply store and they are pretty much have a good strength and stay in the hair. I like how this pack comes with more than one available size since certain parts of my hair such as my bangs are obviously shorter. At night I use these to avoid breakage or split ends in my hair and through the night one or to come out but I usually also use a hear net to keep all of it in as well.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for these kind of hair pins but all I have been able to find were very heavy one or real thin ones. But these were just perfect thanks</li>
    <li> Although the price was great, the product is way to thin/ flimsy for my hair (and it&#x27;s baby-fine).  I ended up throwing them in the trash.</li>
    <li> The pins are different sizes and they hold my hair but it takes a lot of them usually. Also the color fades very  quickly so they are not really black, they are silver with black painted over it.</li>
    <li> worked wonders!  It&#x27;s not easy to hold a wig on securely while doing continuous back handsprings and every which way aerials.</li>
    <li> What I wanted were bobby pins and imagine the surprise when I opened and saw these flimsy, open-ended pins. I has no idea how to use these but these are not returnable, so I guess I&#x27;ll just have to learn... Regardless of how good or bad this product is, I was pretty mad and dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> I am a professional stylist and I really like strong and reliable products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a keeeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of pins today are very weak and thin?????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not these very strong!!!!!</li>
    <li> They are very thin and flimsy</li>
    <li> This pins are not tight at all. The mouth is too wide. The good thing is just the fact that it comes in different sizes. Now I have to order new pins that are tighter and holds hair down well.</li>
    <li> Bad quality, no strength.</li>
    <li> They get disfigured after one use.</li>
    <li> These are terrible bobby pins that don&#x27;t work at all. If I put some in my hair in the morning, they&#x27;ve all fallen out by lunch. They were cheap, but not worth it.</li>
    <li> They work well for holding my hair back.  They are easy to use and hold firmly without bending. Be careful not to get them wet, though - I used them in wet hair and the black paint started to flake off.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about bobby pins, they&#x27;re pretty cool... just need to figure out how to use them now LOL</li>
    <li> Loved the assorted sizes, the only problem is the black paint chips off.  So in some areas, the pins appear silver in my black hair.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly; the assorted sizes are useful.</li>
    <li> The hair pins stay in place with thin fine hair (my three year old) and thick hair (mine). I can do a French twist with 2 or 3 pins instead do more than 20 bobby pins. The rubber ends come off sometimes, but I considered these a disposible product that would naturally have casualties.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it mentions in description that these arent regular bobby pins so its my fault and is why I give 3 stars. Woulda gave 5 if they were like bobby pins that kept my hair in place but I had to use a tool to pinch them together to make them bobby pins so I could have use for them.</li>
    <li> The black coating flakes off of these hairpins, leaving small black paint chips throughout my hair.  Luckily, this does not affect the way the hairpins work but it does leave paint chips in my hair until shampoo time.  The balls at the ends of the hairpins seem to hold up well, which help the hairpins glide through the hair.  (The paint chips aren&#x27;t easily removed from my natural afro textured hair.)  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase these again.</li>
    <li> I bought a one pound box of 3 inch hair pins about twenty years ago (not exaggerating), I used to be a commercial hair and makeup artist so I used them for work too. Since I often reuse them they lasted a really long time, but I finally got down to my last few pins I started looking for the 3 inch hair pins in a smaller quantity but no luck so I got these since I figured the 2 1/2 inch ones would be good to use also. The problem is they are very flimsy compared to the old ones I have which I think are the Soft &#x27;N Style brand. I bought my last box at an ethnic beauty supply since regular professional beauty supply shops only car the 1 1/2 inch size. I still have a couple of the S &#x27;n S ones and you can see the metal on the Diane is visibly thinner and the rubber tip is not as big. My hair is a medium texture, a little past shoulder length with some curl, but I have a lot of hair. These Diane pins are OK for my hair but anyone with very thick, course textured and/or long hair should go for the Soft &#x27;N Style brand. When the time comes for me to reorder I&#x27;ll be going with the S &#x27;n S brand.</li>
    <li> I thought these would be similar to bobby pins, not french pins. They are too open, and I&#x27;m disappointed. The description wasn&#x27;t particular about which type of pins they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention I ordered about for or five things at the same times from a few different sellers, and this arrived a full week later than the last of those items.</li>
    <li> The price was right and the quality is fine, but I wish the size difference between the large and medium pins was more significant.</li>
    <li> Pins work great, but the black paint flecks off in only a couple of wears.  It&#x27;s not worth the buy...</li>
    <li> Love the different lengths to get the perfect protective styles while transitioning.  Very quick delivery.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I did not realize these were french pins.  I have a lot of curly hair, and these pins just do not hold my hair the way I need it to.</li>
    <li> I messed up these are super wide but that&#x27;s how they&#x27;re supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this if you&#x27;re looking for bobby pins.</li>
    <li> Definitely not what I expected. I thought they would be like any other regular Bobby pins. But no they are for girls and women with super thick hair!!</li>
    <li> just got Diane Hair Pins, they looks really nice and in good quality. does not try them yet, but i think they are the product good to have.</li>
    <li> You gotta love the fact that this has three sizes. I have very long hair so i&#x27;ll always start with the extra long ones and work my way down. Love it. They&#x27;re very sturdy too.</li>
    <li> Nice assortment of sizes.</li>
    <li> Great hairpins and it does a very good job keeping my hair at its place especially when working on the kitchen</li>
    <li> These works great for any size hot roller, better then the crappy clips provided in expensive &amp;#34; professional&amp;#34; hot roller kits. I should know I just paid 100 bucks for a system and the clips broke leaving me to turn to these handy little things.</li>
