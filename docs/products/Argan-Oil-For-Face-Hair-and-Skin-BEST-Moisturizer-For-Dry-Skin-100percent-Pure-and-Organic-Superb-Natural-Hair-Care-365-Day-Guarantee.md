<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Lovely lovely product.  My somewhat dry curly hair is so nice and cooperative.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My fiancee loves this! Great for normal to dry hair. A little goes a long way...plus, the pump promotes perfect dispensing every time. Can not say enough about the quality!!</li>
    <li> I really really love this product!!!!  The Argan oil is pure and organic. It is not greasy and massages in beautifully, with no scent.  I love to use it on my face and feet and hands.  I have seen vast improvement in my cuticles and really miss it if I forget to use the oil before I leave the house.  The pump is perfect for dispensing just the right amount of oil.  This is an awesome product!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I tried Organic Argan Oil!  I have terrible nails and cuticles -- peeling red and bleeding.  I put this on as soon as I got it and I already see they are healing!  It&#x27;s miraculous!  Definitely will keep using.  I&#x27;m also going to have my sister try it for her hair which is giving her a problem.  Will update after she tries it.</li>
    <li> So far, I love this item. I used it on the ends of my hair and they already look much shinier and repaired. I have mega split ends right now so I&#x27;m looking to help them as much as I can. And this really has helped! No joke. I&#x27;ll keep using it and hopefully see some MEGA improvement.</li>
    <li> I want a gallon of this.  It is fantastic.  I have only had it for a couple of days, but I wish I could have it in quantity.  It&#x27;s great for skin, hair, and nails.  I had a cut on my arm and put some on it and it seemed to heal faster.  I love the moisturizing effects on my skin.  Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this argan oil to use on my hair and I love it! Makes my hair feel soft like silk.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this oil. It is not super greasy and leaves no shiny residue on my face. My hair felt silky and soft. I&#x27;m so impressed with this. I highly recommend this oil to other people.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I put it on my face and on my hair.  I was surprised to see no shiny residue on my face.  My hair felt silky and soft. No greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt; I have purchased other argan oils and they always leave my face greasy and shiny.  I&#x27;m so impressed with this. This is something I will keep buying.</li>
    <li> I used it in my wet hair and let it dry naturally. Really helped with the frizz. I look forward to trying it on my skin and even for shine on my dry hair too. There is no strong smell which is nice either and I love the fact that there aren&#x27;t any chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I used this on my dry hair. A little goes a long way for shine without a greasy look. Love this product.</li>
    <li> this argan oil feels amazing in my hair. makes my hair super soft, I can really tell a difference. I&#x27;ve  tried others and this one is the best, absorbs quick and is great as a hand moisturizer. I&#x27;ll be ordering more</li>
    <li> I have dry and chemically treated hair, so I use argan oil in my hair while it&#x27;s wet after showering. I&#x27;ve been loyal to Biosilk (I know it&#x27;s not argan oil) but have since been looking for a more natural alternative. I love that this product comes with an easy to use pump, and is small enough to travel with. However, a little goes a long way here! It kept my hair silky and smooth. The reason I&#x27;m not rating this item 5 stars is because I personally don&#x27;t like the smell. It&#x27;s not a strong smell, but it&#x27;s not floral/scented so you can really smell the authentic argan oil which isn&#x27;t the best smelling thing out there. Otherwise, this product rocks and I&#x27;d recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I first heard about Argan Oil on either Dr OZ or the Today show. They were doing a segment on hair products for women as they age. I am 57, and solidly grey underneath my gorgeous brown hair. The texture of grey hair is different, and mine was dry and frizzy because I have colored my hair for so long. I use high end hair products, but still found it was difficult to work with. I was introduced to this particular product because of a promotion, and I jumped at the chance to give it a try! It so happens that it arrived just before I was headed to the shower. I was so excited that I didn&#x27;t read the directions, and sprayed it directly on my hair. Even though I used way too much, I didn&#x27;t look like something out of the 50&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve since been squirting 2 drops into the palms of my hands and working it through my hair. I LOVE this stuff! My hair feels so soft and healthy and it&#x27;s so manageable that I&#x27;m able to get by without some of my high end products. I&#x27;m also finding that I don&#x27;t need to use my hot iron, either, so I&#x27;m feel like my hair will continue to get healthier. The added bonus is that this product is natural, so I&#x27;m reducing the harmful chemicals that I&#x27;m exposing myself too. And with using only two drops a day, this bottle will last probably 3 times longer than my expensive products that I was using! I&#x27;m a new loyal customer!!&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
    <li> I reviewed this oil on my YouTube channel for natural hair and I must say it worked so well for me! It helped protect my ends which led to less breakage. The smell is very light and a little nutty, but it is not strong or offensive.&lt;br /&gt;Check out my video for a more detailed review about this oil helping me stop breakage and retain length:&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;JDEABdVaWOw&amp;index&#x3D;3&amp;list&#x3D;PLO9Y3UPy_CZw1lIgUyaj-vO05yGp58OiD</li>
    <li> I have never used Argan oil before, but have seen it showing up in lots of cosmetics &amp; hair care products so I thought I would give it a try. I am very pleased with this non-oily ORGANIC oil. It has a very, very, very subtle and pleasant scent. The pump is very easy to use. The oil absorbs quickly in my skin and hair and leaves no residue. I am really enjoying this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it everyday after i shower in place of hair product. Your hair feels better, looks better, and is healthier. Best part is that you only need to use a tiny bit so it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> just learning how wonderful this oil is - plan to use for beauty recipes but started out placing directly on skin around my eyes - very moisturizing - hope to curb those crow&#x27;s feet!  love this oil!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice skin care oil. I use it on my hands and feet and face, and it sinks right in easily and quickly, leaving my skin feeling smooth and fresh, with no residue.  I am very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Just received this Argan Oil (really fast shipping!) and it works great in my face products I make! Great quality oil and you can&#x27;t beat the price! Highly recommend for anyone looking to buy a high quality essential oil!</li>
    <li> Oil itself is great!  When it arrived, some of the oil had spilled into the packaging, so everything was all oily.  Very little was wasted though.  Really nice on the skin, though!</li>
    <li> I have used Argan Oil first time. It&#x27;s awesome and worked like miracle. I had never used any other brand Oil but, this brand oil is so good.&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder once i finished using it.&lt;br /&gt;Pur365 keep quality of product same.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this product, Pur365 Argan Oil because it feels good when I apply it to my skin, hair and nails. The scent is almost non-existent and that&#x27;s a plus for me because it doesn&#x27;t compete with anything else you might use. This product comes packaged in a pump bottle but, I find that I prefer a dropper-style bottle because (for me) it&#x27;s easier to control the amount of oil when using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had my oil for 3 days, but I must admit; so far, so good. I like the texture and non-greasy feeling of the oil. I wear my hair in it&#x27;s natural state and the argan oil makes it even softer. I would definitely recommend it...and the price is GREAT! I&#x27;m back for an update...I truly like this oil.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with it. It has made my very dry over processed hair soft again.</li>
    <li> When I used Pur365 Argan Oil, 100% Pure and Organic Moroccan Argan Oil on the back of my hands I was pleasantly surprised. Before the use of Argan Oil I used coconut oil. With the coconut oil I had to use it a couple time a day to make the back of my hand look smooth. But with Argan oil I use it once a day after my daily shower and my hands stay smooth all day.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anyone with dry aging hands.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received this Argan oil at a discount in exchange for an honest review&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I just received my bottle of Argan Oil and I LOVE IT!!!  I am SO excited to have found such a product that feels SO Good.  I have never used this before but i will be ordering more!!</li>
    <li> Thumbs up for this product! Applied it to dry heels, dry elbows and on a couple of dry spots on my legs and it appears to completely soothe the areas and moisturizes the dryness. Makes your skin feel so supple and soft! It isn&#x27;t too oily if you massage it in, I noticed that it makes my hands so soft after applying it on the other areas. Look forward to trying it on my hair, especially with the summer humidity to control frizzies!</li>
    <li> This oil is absolutely amazing! I dab a little and brush my hair in a bun. Very soft and manageable! Not greasy at all. Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Wanted the true Morrocan oil.  This is a little greasier.  Probably will just use it differently.  Great for the price.</li>
    <li> I just received the oil. It&#x27;s light weight and has no weird smell like some other oils.</li>
    <li> Argan Oil is a wonderful hair and skin oil that I found helps smooths dry, frizzy hair and provides necessary nourishment for the skin without causing me or my children to breakout in pimples. The Pur365 Argan oil is one of the best Argan oils we&#x27;ve used to date, and is my new favorite! The fact that it is organic gives me the confidence to use this on myself and my family without worrying about harmful chemical residue. The pump dispenser saves me a lot of money by my children not knocking it over while using it and spilling it all over the counter. I will buy this again in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for a review. All my opinions are mine and are based on my personal experience with the product.  Even though I received this at a discounted price, I will be buying it again at full price because I like it that much.</li>
    <li> My argan oil arrived quickly. I&#x27;ve tried using this product multiple ways and it leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> Pros: I love the pump, the quality of the product seems great! Great for dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It did not smell good to me and I think it caused some minor breakouts on my skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I have been hesitant about trying this on my hair. It is naturally curly and very dry. It&#x27;s been very hard to switch to natural products as far as my hair is concerned.  No longer! I&#x27;ve used this on both my natural curls and my straightened hair and absolutely love it. It helps with unruly fly always, adds shine and vitality to my hair. I&#x27;ve used in on my skin with no oily residue.  This product doesn&#x27;t have a pungent, smelly odor,  nor is it laced with chemicals to try to make it smell good.  It has a very slight natural odor (but it&#x27;s not bad). It&#x27;s also non-greasy. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product, so I&#x27;ll stop there.  I plan to continue to purchase this on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> It felt wonderful on my skin, but the aroma was less than pleasant to me. That said, the seller took care of things immediately.  Excellent vendor!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I love argan oil. I especially love that this come with a sprayer.</li>
    <li> Great oil. Haven&#x27;t used it long but I like how it is not very greasy when applied. Feels nice on skin.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful product! Leaves your hair in silky beautiful condition!! Love it and will buy again!</li>
    <li> My daughter is pleaded with this item-</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and it was all that I expected.</li>
    <li> Soaks in well to the skin and leaves the skin smooth.</li>
    <li> Very good product.i will sure buy again !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days on my hair and skin and it&#x27;s amazing. My inquiries with their customer service were phenomenal as well!!</li>
    <li> For the first time in my life I&#x27;m not picking and biting my cuticles until they bleed. Normally, no matter how often I get my nails done, I still pick at my cuticles. It&#x27;s just a bad habit and they are always gnarly because I have to wash my hands a lot every day for work. This Argan Oil has been a cuticle saver. My hands are soft and moisturized and the oil is not greasy at all so it rubs right in and almost immediately I can go back to whatever I was doing without fear I&#x27;m going to get oil on everything. I love that it&#x27;s 100% organic too!</li>
    <li> I ask my girlfriend to try this product. She added it to her shampoo and found her hair became fuller, more lustrous and it helped her split ends. As a surprising bonus the oil is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t seem to have any odor. It&#x27;s also nice that a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I have only had the argan oil for a few days. I have extremely dry skin so have tried it on my face the last two nights. I wake up with the skin feeling so soft and not so dry. I am excited to keep using it and hoping for even better results as time goes by. So far, I am very happy with this product. Very good communication with the vendor and super quick shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Update, after a few weeks of putting this oil on my dry skin I can honestly say I have no more peeling skin.</li>
    <li> I received the product quickly and I have been using it daily.  I include a couple of drops with my night cream and apply it to my face. It is not at all greasy.  I have only been using this product for about a week and it does make my skin feel soft.  I will have to continue to use for a longer period of time to see more results.  Will return at a later time with an update.</li>
    <li> Amazing Argan oil.Simply the best!. I have used it and happy to give my assessment. It made my hair very sofht and silky, smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;This company Pur 365 is at the forefront in terms of researching and sourcing the highest quality oil for consumers.  Thank you Pur 365! I am definitely ordering my additional  bottles</li>
    <li> The lady loves it! Currently using it for both skin and hair application. On the skin, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer. For hair, smooth and shiny without weighing it dow</li>
    <li> Lovely, just what I needed as a carrier oil for my essential oils</li>
    <li> I like this oil. I used it on areas of dry skin and especially those areas which were red and irritated looking.  It almost fully removed the redness and although it was not a cure of any kind for my own particular skin condition (sebhorreic dermatitis) it worked excellent as a daily cover up so that I felt comfortable out in public.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 was because it did not truly absorb as much as much as I had wanted but that was remedied by a little blotting with a slightly damp cloth. The smell is faint and slightly like olive oil. In full disclosure, I was provided a discount for providing an honest review of the product.</li>
    <li> Really liked this product, smells nutty, authentic, and works wonderfully well- it&#x27;s such a versatile product!</li>
    <li> Got this right away. I haven&#x27;t tried it but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love it.&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy using argan oil for my skin and hair and of course you can buy the best here on Amazon for way cheaper.</li>
    <li> To my surprise, this product arrived in a very timely manner.  My hair is very dry and brittle.  I have used so many products without seeing any improvement.  This product makes my hair shine and feel so silky, without weighing it down or making it feel greasy.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. A little goes a long way. Just a drop or two is all it takes. Great for my face because I have very dry skin and it leaves it feeling smooth and not oily.</li>
    <li> very moisturizing - I used it on my face during some really rough weather and it helped soothe and soften my skin.  I get flaky patches in the winter time and it definitely helped with those and gave me a nice glow. It didn&#x27;t do much for some spots of eczema but nothing has really helped that.</li>
    <li> Excellente service. I&#x27;m happy with the product too :)</li>
    <li> I am very careful about the chemicals I put on and in my body, so I&#x27;ve been using baking soda to clean my hair for several years. While it is effective, my hairdresser has been urging me to use a conditioner as my hair is getting a bit dry and flyaway. I&#x27;m so pleased to have found this argan oil. It&#x27;s the perfect solution! It&#x27;s light and non-greasy feeling, but gives my hair a little loving that helps it calm down and look it&#x27;s bright and shiny best. The packaging is great, too, as you can easily squirt a small amount into the palm of your hand and don&#x27;t waste any.</li>
    <li> Good product! Really helped with my dry, flaky skin!</li>
    <li> This is high quality Argan oil.  I have tried many argan oils and this is truly a #1!!!!  I use it on skin, hair and nails.  It has many uses and I love it!  It makes my hair smoother and softer and my nails less brittle.  I love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Leaked a little in shipping, but was in a sealed plastic bag.  Product is wonderful so far!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I have only used it for 3 days on my very dry heels and they are smooth and soft already. Also used the Argan oil on my hands and hair. I think I found the fountain of youth :) It is not greasy at all and the pump dispenser is great and makes it a mess free application.  I will definitely be buying this again</li>
    <li> I have used this oil for a couple of days now. I really like it a lot! I have used it as a facial moisturizer and have used as a hair conditioner. I love the pump dispenser as it helps control the amount I want to use. A little goes a long way! This oil absorbs quickly and my skin feels very soft. It&#x27;s not too heavy to use in my hair either. I have read a bit about argan oil and its benefits. This is truly a great product. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying Argan oil and I am pleased with the results. Thus far, I have tried it on my hair ( a little goes a long way) and the heels of my feet. It also works really well on my hands, which tend to dry out easily. I tried it once on my face, but I don&#x27;t care for the smell so I&#x27;ll stick with my coconut oil. I&#x27;m excited to try some of the recommendations from other reviewers.</li>
    <li> I used it for my hair and skin.</li>
    <li> I have had this mark on my face for a number of years. It has a tendency to dry out. I used the Argan oil just once, and it kept it from drying out all day. I have used other products that didn&#x27;t keep it from drying out.</li>
    <li> It is one of the best oils out there in my opinion because of its benefits and how it does make my hair and skin feels. I have added this argan oil to my daily beauty routine. I recommend this brand simply because you cant beat the quality of it!! It is just a really great oil! I received this oil at a discounted price in exchange for my review and feedback, these are all 100 % my opinions.I use this oil for everything from my hair, my face right before I apply my makeup so that it goes on because it makes it blend better, my finger and toenails, lips, feet and elbows.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! My hair was a little dry and frizzy on the ends and just a tiny amount of this oil made it practically silky! I used it on my face, too, and it was really nice. A good moisturizer without feeling greasy. I appreciate the pump dispenser, too. I like to extend the life of my products as much as possible and the pump dispenser helps me use only the amount I need. I will definitely buy this again! Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I currently use this as a moisturizer for my hands, but have also used it for my hair and face. It does not feel greasy or leave a residue. This product is amazing, and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> This is my first experience using Aragn Oil and this product is wonderful!  I have been using it on my face and hands and I was surprised that it was not very &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;.  It is very moisturizing without being sticky and oily and it absorbs into the skin nicely!  I will be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> This is great Argan Oil for the price.  It&#x27;s perfect for your face---keeps it smooth and moisturized.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Been using this oil for a little over a week now and I really like it a lot.  Tried it on my hair, hands, face and elbows.  I live in the northeast and this winter really took a toll on my hair and skin.  The argan oil has definitely helped a lot in just a short amount of time.  It absorbs well and does not have an offputting smell like some oils do.  Softened my hair without making it look greasy.  A little bit goes a long way.  Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great for hair and skin.  We love this stuff at our house!</li>
