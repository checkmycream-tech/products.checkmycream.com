      <li>great as expected from weleda</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fragrance and short shelf life, but it works fairly well and like the idea that it&#x27;s ingredients are &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.</li>

      <li>I think it&#x27;s a good lotion -- the perfect thickness, easy to spread, moisturizing, and non-irritating (even to my sensitive skin, even after cutting myself while shaving my legs).  </li>
      <li>This lotion is not only great as a body moisturizer, it works great for dry, rough hands too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it absorbs right away.</li>
      <li>This is my first Weleda product.  </li>
      <li>thighs actually appeared more taut.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a fan of most of the Weleda products I&#x27;ve tried to date, especially their pomegranate products and this lotion</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a terrible smell, and I&#x27;ll certainly finish the bottle, but I will probably choose a different fragrance if I purchase this again.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care for as much</li>
      <li>Does a pomegranate really smell like this?  </li>
      <li>I surprised my wife with this lotion, and she absolutely loves it.</li>
      <li>(For what it&#x27;s worth, the ingredients list on the product page is cut off -- the last word there should be &amp;#34;coumarin,&amp;#34; and this also contains</li>
      <li>Perfect lotion for cold days!</li>
      <li>My skin stays soft and hydrated all day.</li>
      <li>I put it on at night before going to bed leaves your skin soft</li>
      <li>This is a fine moisturizer but not sure I will buy it again.</li>
      <li>I am 53, over-weight &amp; my skin has really started  showning the negative effects of all those MANY years spent sun bathing &amp; using tanning beds.</li>
      <li>is definitely one of my new favs.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not at all what I expected -- it really smells like something with a synthetic polymer in it, even though there aren&#x27;t any ingredients like that on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s strange, because this product only contains natural ingredients, but it smells like glue or paste or paint to me.  </li>

    <li> I am 53, over-weight &amp; my skin has really started  showning the negative effects of all those MANY years spent sun bathing &amp; using tanning beds. Okay. Got a visual on all that?&lt;br /&gt;My friend gave me a bottle of Weleda&#x27;s Regenerating Pomegranate lotion for Christmas. I don&#x27;t think I have EVER IN MY LIFE used a product that I TRULY saw the benefits of until using this product. Honestly- within a week or so the skin on my upper/front (?) thighs actually appeared more taut. The skin problems I have ALWAYS had there- went away. It was like magic!! I told my friend that I finally felt like I had &amp;#34;real girl&amp;#34; skin! This stuff actually WORKS!!! It does for my skin anyway.</li>
    <li> great as expected from weleda</li>

    <li> I love Weleda&#x27;s body lotion. I think the formula works well -- it&#x27;s light, but effective. I&#x27;m giving this lotion 4 stars because I don&#x27;t love the scent. It&#x27;s kind of similar to the citrus scent, but I like the citrus one better. This one kind of smells like sweet Pez candy. To be honest, the three Weleda body lotion scents I&#x27;ve tried are unusual. My favorite one is the rose, but others find it very strong.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! It thoroughly moisturizes my skin without a greasy feeling afterward.  And the scent is beautiful without being overwhelming.</li>

    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again because of it&#x27;s fragrance and short shelf life, but it works fairly well and like the idea that it&#x27;s ingredients are &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;. It should be used up in a month or two. Texture got sticky after a few months.</li>
