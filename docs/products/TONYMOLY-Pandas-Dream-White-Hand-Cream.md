      <li>Has a nice fresh scent.</li>
      <li>Good cream, but doesn&#x27;t work too much on my hand</li>
      <li>I read online that it was supposed to get rid of redness in skin, so I thought sweet!</li>
      <li>It is not that much and cream inside but who cares when it&#x27;s so cute!</li>
      <li>... the quality of the packaging is fantastic, not cheapy at all</li>
      <li>It is fantastic for moisturizing, whitening has NO affect.  </li>
      <li>It has a light sweet scent that is not overpowering which is important for me since I have asthma and irritable airways.</li>
      <li>Very fresh and mild.</li>
      <li>The bottle is small, and so cute, it makes a great gift.</li>
      <li>It has a refreshing scent, and it adds so much moisture to your hands.</li>
      <li>I was surprised that the hand cream was so nice.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stand the smell of the lotion (really sweet), but my daughter seems to like it</li>
      <li>Thus was a gift and it was very well received she is still talking about the cute packaging</li>
      <li>Not too overwhelming.. Very moisturizing too.</li>
      <li>TONYMOLY Panda&#x27;s Dream White Hand Cream is absolutely cute!</li>
      <li>Wonderful hand cream (very thick).</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s pretty moisturizing, but</li>
      <li>Firstly, the container is adorable!&lt;br</li>
      <li>and once you finish the lotion you got a super cute container to put other things in :O&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
      <li>So ADORABLE and the hand cream is very rich, thick and smells pretty.</li>
      <li>It washed right off and my face looked normal again.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>A very subjective issue but by no means a deal breaker.  </li>
      <li>Well I don&#x27;t use this as a hand cream because it is so very greasy.  </li>
      <li>The Cream is thick, and smells good.</li>
      <li>Not the porcelain pretty look, but the, wow I should run myself to a hospital look.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s small and moisturizes nicely.</li>
      <li>But it ended up being more of a white paint, then something that actually goes into the skin and gets rid of/reduces redness.</li>
      <li>The only thing I wish is that it was sold in a giant life sized panda jar :)</li>
      <li>A little bit bulky for handbags but so adorable on vanity.</li>
      <li>It absorbs just fine after a couple minutes, though, and although the scent has a definite artificial quality to it (to my nose, anyway), it&#x27;s still nice!</li>
      <li>Bigger than expected and leaves your skin very smooth.</li>
      <li>*), the lotion itself is very &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; almost like a very heavy whipped mousse, smell is very tolerable, like artificial grapes, but in the best way possible.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;m a nurse so my hands get super, crazy dry after washing them every five seconds. I have also tried just about every lotion out there. Most leave a greasy residue or wash off as soon as I put it on. This hand cream is very thick but a little goes a LONG way and keeps my hands moistured even after washing them a couple times! It also smells so good... Like lychee or something. The only thing I wish is that it was sold in a giant life sized panda jar :)</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t lie, I bought it for the container! It is too cute! The little paws are 3d and stick out like the ears! It is not that much and cream inside but who cares when it&#x27;s so cute! I was surprised that the hand cream was so nice. It is so thick and moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t leave your hands greasy. Smells great too. Very fresh and mild.</li>
    <li> This is super adorable and the hand cream smells really good. Seriously, I was expecting the lotion to have that cheap cream/lotion smell, but it didn&#x27;t, bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter love&#x27;s Panda&#x27;s and was super happy with this. Now she can stay away from my face cream that&#x27;s in identical packaging. :)</li>
    <li> So ADORABLE and the hand cream is very rich, thick and smells pretty. It kind of smells like a grape jelly candy BUT very light not over powering at all. Shipping came super early and I am SO happy with my purchase! I want like 100 more of these little guys and admit I bought this for the adorable package but... the quality of the packaging is fantastic, not cheapy at all and I can&#x27;t wait to try more of their products. This is my second time purchasing from this seller and I am extremely happy!</li>
    <li> its smell really good and works well but I wish I got more for the price very cute tho:)</li>
    <li> It smells so light and girly and the packaging is ADORABLE! Buy it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> The cutest packaging of a hand cream ever. The structure of the cream is also so nice without over greasy. A little bit bulky for handbags but so adorable on vanity. Definitely a must have.</li>
    <li> I like it, its so cute.</li>
    <li> Love it... Has a nice fresh scent. Not too overwhelming.. Very moisturizing too. Packaging is way too cute..</li>
    <li> My friend gave it to me as a gift from Japan. I seriously love the packaging and the smell! It&#x27;s small and moisturizes nicely. Definitely a Panda Lover&#x27;s must have.</li>
    <li> Super cute and has a really nice smell however I dont like how it leaves off this shiny look after applying.</li>
    <li> Wonderful hand cream (very thick). It also smells great and is very moisturizing!! Got here on time with samples. I got this for my sister but I will buy it again for myself.</li>
    <li> So cute!! Bigger than expected and leaves your skin very smooth.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it and it has a nice smell, not too strong.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a gardener, always abusing and washing my hands. For years I&#x27;ve used a thick petrolatum/lanolin based moisturizer at night with gloves to keep my hands soft and smooth. I&#x27;d heard about this little panda, and thought I might as well give it a try. So glad I did! It has a bit of a &amp;#34;girlie&amp;#34; scent that lasts 5 seconds, but my hands drink this lotion right up. I&#x27;ve stopped using my heavier stuff at night, and I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;m able to use the panda in the daytime as well because it&#x27;s not greasy.  The added bonus is, he&#x27;s cute!</li>
    <li> I gave this lotion a try because the container is adorable. The lotion has a grassy unpleasant (to me) smell that just does not fade. I ended up filling the container with another hand cream I do like so it wouldn&#x27;t be a total waste.</li>
    <li> Thus was a gift and it was very well received she is still talking about the cute packaging</li>
    <li> nice cream in a cute container</li>
    <li> Very cute packaging, nice smell and texture, lets see how does it work.</li>
    <li> An adorable and pretty decent hand creme at an excellent price.  My only negative is the scent is very sweet and kinda gets to me after a while. A very subjective issue but by no means a deal breaker.  But the best part of all is that it is totally refillable for any of your favorite hand creams. Love it.</li>
    <li> Works good and smells very nice and oh so cute!</li>
    <li> The container is like other reviewers stated &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34; the cream is waxy at first, but will sink into your skin.  It is fantastic for moisturizing, whitening has NO affect.  Smells like fruit roll ups, plus.</li>
    <li> Really cute container. I can&#x27;t stand the smell of the lotion (really sweet), but my daughter seems to like it and I bought it for her.</li>
    <li> OMG so cute :*), the lotion itself is very &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; almost like a very heavy whipped mousse, smell is very tolerable, like artificial grapes, but in the best way possible.  and once you finish the lotion you got a super cute container to put other things in :O&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on the lotion qualities- it&#x27;s pretty moisturizing, but not terribly so- I like it because it&#x27;s non-greasy and essentially does what I bought it for</li>
    <li> So, so cute!  Smells great and feels great!</li>
    <li> This comes in the cutest container ever! The product inside works wonders on dry hands and a little goes a long way so it lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> A great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> Well I don&#x27;t use this as a hand cream because it is so very greasy.  It&#x27;s great as a foot lotion at night though.  It has a pleasant floral/fruit smell when you apply it, and the container is adorable.  The moment this runs out I am filling it up with another lotion because I don&#x27;t want to toss the cute panda jar.</li>
    <li> Smell soo good! Good cream, but doesn&#x27;t work too much on my hand&lt;br /&gt;Quickly spedition</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not quite what I expected</li>
    <li> Love it!! It is especially great for the dry skin you get in the middle of the cold winter months.</li>
    <li> It absorbs just fine after a couple minutes, though, and although the scent has a definite artificial quality to it (to my nose, anyway), it&#x27;s still nice! The big draw is the panda container, of course -- I like seeing this guy chilling on my desk.</li>
    <li> Not for deep moisture. But the package is very cute.</li>
    <li> Both my mom and I love this product. It has a light sweet scent that is not overpowering which is important for me since I have asthma and irritable airways. This is one of the few scents that doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me. I will have to purchase again when I am about out. I&#x27;m hoping to try the other items in this line.</li>
    <li> Very nice hand cream and LOVE the panda container.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this by the way, but after one use it was gross. It smells like old ladies. Not only that but when I put it on my face (thinking that&#x27;s what it was for since it was only a sample) it made me look sickly pale like I was about to die. Not the porcelain pretty look, but the, wow I should run myself to a hospital look. Then again, I am already significantly pale. Even though I know it&#x27;s a hand cream now, I can&#x27;t imagine why someone would want sickly pale, old lady smelling hands. It&#x27;s not even a lotion, it&#x27;s a mask. It washed right off and my face looked normal again. Though it still smelled really bad. I read online that it was supposed to get rid of redness in skin, so I thought sweet! But it ended up being more of a white paint, then something that actually goes into the skin and gets rid of/reduces redness. I&#x27;m soooo glad I got this as a sample and didn&#x27;t make the mistake of buying it.</li>
    <li> I like it . At dosent smell like flowers but at dosent bother me eather . But i prefer to use it in my hands more than my face</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great. I love it</li>
    <li> I love it! I kinda want to buy one for myself, I got this for a friend. The scent is very sweet and nice. It&#x27;s much bigger than I expected. Highly recommend this! The packaging is also very adorable and even came with an extra sampler of another product which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
    <li> TONYMOLY Panda&#x27;s Dream White Hand Cream is absolutely cute! The bottle is small, and so cute, it makes a great gift. The Cream is thick, and smells good. It has a refreshing scent, and it adds so much moisture to your hands. This product is definitely great during the winter season. I would recommend this item. Great Buy!</li>
    <li> Firstly, the container is adorable!&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I love the smell of this product. It kind of smells like really sweet grapefruit.&lt;br /&gt;When I use it, it does make my hands smoother even up to a couple of days after using it. The redness on my knuckles has gone down, and my skin never looks dry anymore. But, as a warning, it does feel a little waxy at first and it takes about 10 minutes to fully sink in.&lt;br /&gt;Also, my mother-in-law who is allergic to almost everything can use this and she doesn&#x27;t have a reaction to it. She has darker skin than I do, as well, but it doesn&#x27;t actually whiten your skin, it just evens the tone and reduces redness.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing! Moisturizers my hands great and it&#x27;s so cute. I&#x27;m happy I found out about Tony Moly because I love his products!</li>
