      <li>I really liked them.  </li>
      <li>Love, Love, Love!</li>
      <li>I tried with different stampers, and another CICI&amp;SISI plate that works perfectly, and nothing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I love the size as well.</li>
      <li>I love the cici and sisi nail stamping kit I can&#x27;t wait to order the others</li>
      <li>I hope more come out</li>
      <li>I do love the plates and stamper though.</li>
      <li>I love them</li>
      <li>The stamper is just okay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with them and will be ordering a new set soon</li>
      <li>The old jumbo plate works great</li>
      <li>Metal scratches easily</li>
      <li>Got here very quickly</li>
      <li>These plates have lots of variety and work fine.</li>
      <li>My one issue is the way it&#x27;s packaged leaves the stamper with a huge dent.</li>
      <li>The designs are accurate.  </li>
      <li>I love this whole line of stamping plates.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to use .</li>
      <li>I chose this particular set because of certain images I liked and those are the ones that my plates didn&#x27;t have.</li>
      <li>The plates are deeply etched and clear, and every one I&#x27;ve tried so far as transferred perfectly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they would have fixed it if i had.</li>
      <li>The whole image doesn&#x27;t fit on my nail unless it&#x27;s a normal design and not a photo.</li>
      <li>I like this set,but the first two sets are my favorites.</li>
      <li>I hadn&#x27;t expected that, so it was a nice bonus.</li>
      <li>Only because most of these pates are taken up by graphics that are FAR TOO BIG to fit on anyones nails!  </li>
      <li>Such a cool set of stamps and the carrying case is just right to organize for mobile nail tech.</li>
      <li>fast shipping even in this blizzard.</li>
      <li>Was very upset with this set.  </li>
      <li>They bend easy and images are not real detailed</li>
      <li>One was torn nearly all the way through when i opened it and tore completely out of the book as i turned the pages the first time.</li>
      <li>I can understand wanting to maybe grab a part of a design for a stamp, but everything within the design is simply too big to fit on a nail.  </li>
      <li>I bought the first 2 sets shortly after they came out.</li>
      <li>especially if you like the softer type (just file it a teeny bit first and go over it with some remover).  </li>
      <li>Some of the images in the set ARE large, as others have said, but I think that was obvious from the pictures.  </li>
      <li>I had been wanting to try some plates that had large scenes that could be used across multiple nails and these plates didn&#x27;t dissappoint.</li>
      <li>These are large enough to cover even longer nails.</li>
      <li>I meant to contact the company but got busy and forgot so thats on me.</li>
      <li>a lot of the images are thick and big not sure if a lot of them will fit on nails to be able to tell what the image is.</li>
      <li>They are about 3/4 the size of my other extra large plates.</li>
      <li>This is my first set of stamping plates and while I do like them, the ones I received are missing some of the designs that are pictured.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Such a cool set of stamps and the carrying case is just right to organize for mobile nail tech.</li>
    <li> I love this whole line of stamping plates. I bought the first 2 sets shortly after they came out. The images all stamp well. I love the size as well. These are large enough to cover even longer nails. I had been wanting to try some plates that had large scenes that could be used across multiple nails and these plates didn&#x27;t dissappoint.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love! I am obsessed. I hope more come out i will buy them. I have each set. I would like to see a collage, maybe animal print, stars, and holiday plates.</li>
    <li> Really a great tool . The only thing I can say I dislike about it was the rubber stamp tends to fall out . It&#x27;s pretty easy to use .</li>
    <li> Great product.  Got here very quickly</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and love it! The images are etched deep so you get a nice image. If you&#x27;re looking for great plates at a great deal def get this!</li>
    <li> Very good quality. Metal scratches easily</li>
    <li> Was very upset with this set.  I cannot use the stamper because it arrived in its box with a crease down the center of it.  Don&#x27;t know where to return it.</li>
    <li> a lot of the images are thick and big not sure if a lot of them will fit on nails to be able to tell what the image is.</li>
    <li> I like the plate but they are too big for my nail bed.  I suggest you measure your nail bed before you purchase any stamp plates.</li>
    <li> fast shipping even in this blizzard. packaged nice has everything described.</li>
    <li> I like these stamping plates and the stamper a lot. I was disappointed in the so called protective sleeves though. One was torn nearly all the way through when i opened it and tore completely out of the book as i turned the pages the first time. Another was torn about half way and was out by the time i took the plate out. I meant to contact the company but got busy and forgot so thats on me. I&#x27;m sure they would have fixed it if i had. I do love the plates and stamper though.</li>

    <li> I really liked them.  The designs are accurate.  I&#x27;m happy with them and will be ordering a new set soon</li>
    <li> These plates have lots of variety and work fine.</li>
    <li> The book it came in is trashed. Every holder for the plates are ripped and damaged.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loved........good</li>
    <li> I like this...the stamp works great...wish the scraper was bigger.</li>
    <li> The designs are too shallow and don&#x27;t pick up. I tried with different stampers, and another CICI&amp;SISI plate that works perfectly, and nothing. The old jumbo plate works great but this one doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL. So, so frustrating. I returned it. :(</li>
    <li> Love these, they work perfect. Only complaint is the designs are pretty big and I have small fingers and small nails. The whole image doesn&#x27;t fit on my nail unless it&#x27;s a normal design and not a photo.</li>
    <li> Loved the product. Will purchase again!  Thank you</li>
    <li> in the description said the measure is 15 cm by 19 cm, that is wrong they are smaller 14.5cm by 9.5 cm.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing I love them</li>
    <li> I love the cici and sisi nail stamping kit I can&#x27;t wait to order the others</li>
    <li> If I would have known I was not going to to get perfect plates, I would not have ordered them.  The back of the boards were glued on backwards to the plates, and yes it does not harm the stamping plates but that is not what I expected.</li>
    <li> These ones are the worst I had purchased from this company.  Only because most of these pates are taken up by graphics that are FAR TOO BIG to fit on anyones nails!  I can understand wanting to maybe grab a part of a design for a stamp, but everything within the design is simply too big to fit on a nail.

    <li> The plates are great.  The stamper is just okay.</li>
    <li> Nice set of 6 stamping images with case...I wouldn&#x27;t call it jumbo tho...kind of misleading... They are about 3/4 the size of my other extra large plates. But I do like the size...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. They bend easy and images are not real detailed</li>
    <li> I think this is a good set for trying out stamping. My one issue is the way it&#x27;s packaged leaves the stamper with a huge dent. The dent unfortunately makes it very difficult to get a clear design.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the plates themselves are ok and great for a beginner stamper.</li>
    <li> Some of the images in the set ARE large, as others have said, but I think that was obvious from the pictures.  The plates are deeply etched and clear, and every one I&#x27;ve tried so far as transferred perfectly.  Surprisingly the free stamper included is quite good, too- especially if you like the softer type (just file it a teeny bit first and go over it with some remover).  I hadn&#x27;t expected that, so it was a nice bonus.</li>
