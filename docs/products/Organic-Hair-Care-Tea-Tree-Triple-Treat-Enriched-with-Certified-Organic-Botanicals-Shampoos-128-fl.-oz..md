      <li>The tea tree benefits are great with elimination of any scalp itching, even during winter and without any feel of oils or conditioners.  </li>
      <li>Was happy to find this in bulk.  </li>
      <li>Great product - have used it for years.</li>
      <li>The shampoo itself is so great.</li>
      <li>hair feels softer, I don&#x27;t even need their conditioner, which is also great .</li>
      <li>Great shampoo.</li>
      <li>Great value to buy in bulk.</li>
      <li>On top of being good with nature, they are very good for you too.</li>
      <li>(good for the planet and your pocket).</li>
      <li>It works well, smells good, and leaves your scalp &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s every bit as good as those are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I was good to go.  </li>
      <li>smell and feel is very refreshing.  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this shampoo!</li>
      <li>So glad I got it!</li>
      <li>While we consider this to be the best attribute of Triple Treat, it is unusual, and not everyone may be as enamored with it as we are.</li>
      <li>I bought a pump separately and now I don&#x27;t need to worry about running around looking for this kind of shampoo for a while.</li>
      <li>it is also more cost effective.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite shampoo and I am so glad to find such a great price and ordering a gallon was a great idea.</li>
      <li>This is the favorite shampoo in our house.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s refreshing and soothing.</li>
      <li>I love this brand.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo, love this size.  </li>
      <li>money cash bills  currencies and banknotes ,refreshing theruapatic and invirogating .</li>
      <li>Clarifies while offering a pleasant tingling sensation (thanks to the mint extracts).</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo, it has no laurel sulfates which cause hair thinning, cleans gently and smells really good.  </li>
      <li>The scalp tingle from the menthol is pleasantly stimulating, and it rinses out easily and completely.  </li>
      <li>The peppermint part of it gives a fantastic wake up call in the morning.  </li>
      <li>This is a fabulous shampoo.  </li>
      <li>The hair still feels quite clean.  </li>
      <li>is squeaky hair clean and feeling refreshed.</li>
      <li>Love the product, the seller not so much.</li>
      <li>This particular one, the Tea Tree Triple Treat makes you feel like you are in a SPA... its \\&quot;minty\\&quot; scent and feeling on your scalp is refreshing and invigorating, wakes you up in the morning, and relaxes you on an afternoon or night shower.</li>
      <li>I think that I will go back to the Paul Mitchell next time since the lavender/mint scent on that is so wonderful and invigorating.  </li>
      <li>I have been using only Giovanni hair products for more than 3 years now, they are fabulous.</li>
      <li>do eventually get a build-up, but I use a different shampoo for a couple of days and it goes back to working great.</li>
      <li>So I returned the first one, they credited my card, and I ordered again.</li>
      <li>Cruelty free and all natural.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the first tea tree oil shampoo that&#x27;s really worked.</li>
      <li>Does not get hair squeaky clean or smell same as original clear shampoo as purchased from store first time.</li>
      <li>So when I saw this Tea Tree shampoo, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy a large size.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very therapeutic for scalp issues like itching and flaking.</li>
      <li>Yes, the name, the picture, and the description all appear to be what you are looking for, but the product shipped is actually Giovanni Smooth</li>
      <li>But my guess is that getting this stuff in the eyes would be a real problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Yes, that is reasonable and I thought that as well.</li>
      <li>Again, it is Giovanni Smooth as Silk Deep Moisture Shampoo.</li>
      <li>I was looking for original clear shampoo but this is a darker amber color and not same quality as originally purchased from store which was clear.</li>
      <li>Short but sweet</li>
      <li>The first shampoo that&#x27;s completely cured my dandruff after 25 years of using Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
      <li>Obviously the product is worth the price because I keep buying it.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve never used this one, its got a fresh minty smell, can tingle if left on too long but cleans effectively and will remove resides built up from other shampoos.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;d say I get about 3 times the mileage per oz than most other shampoos that I&#x27;ve used, with a couple of exceptions that tend to run in the $20/pt range.  </li>
      <li>It leaves your scalp clean and slightly tingling.</li>
      <li>Just poured it into my old shampoo bottle</li>
      <li>It is available in much smaller quantities, but it&#x27;s considerably more expensive.  </li>
      <li>At first I thought, I ordered the wrong kind, but I went back and verified</li>
      <li>:  This tea tree shampoo will get your hair clean, wake you up, and not leave heavy perfumes or scents on you.  </li>
      <li>overall color is quite clear.  </li>
      <li>just like the old redeemable global YUN / YUO Yugoslavia EEU</li>
      <li>I also buy this large container to help minimize waste, and fill up my older smaller bottles.</li>
      <li>Yet buying it by the pint is still far more expensive.  </li>
      <li>With as much, or rather as little, hair as I have, this jug could last us a year.</li>

<li> only drawback is that it is hard to find the 128 oz size, and the shipping costs tend to be very high.  </li>
<li> Gentle enough that they do not irritate your eyes in the shower, just a little is enough, so you use less</li>
<li> Pair with the Triple Treat conditioner for dry hair.</li>
<li> I let it run down onto my face and it does the same thing there that it does for my scalp.  </li>
<li> On the other hand, it doesn&#x27;t deteriorate on the shelf, so it works for us.</li>

<li> The shampoos do not \\&quot;over foam\\&quot;, which means less rinsing water!</li>
<li> usually I don&#x27;t like anything with a scent</li>
<li> The Giovanni has a faint fragrance, but it is not nearly as much of a wake up scent in the morning.</li>
<li> Kinda expensive, but if you do the math, it&#x27;s cheaper than the little bottles.</li>
<li> You may think &amp;#34;oh, they just sent her the wrong one, mistakes happen&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> Very irritating and very inconvenient.</li>

    <li> This works well as a daily shampoo to prevent seborrhoeic dermatitis.  I switched from the Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo due to the lower price.  I think that I will go back to the Paul Mitchell next time since the lavender/mint scent on that is so wonderful and invigorating.  The Giovanni has a faint fragrance, but it is not nearly as much of a wake up scent in the morning.</li>
    <li> I have been using only Giovanni hair products for more than 3 years now, they are fabulous. On top of being good with nature, they are very good for you too. Gentle enough that they do not irritate your eyes in the shower, just a little is enough, so you use less and they last longer! The shampoos do not \\&quot;over foam\\&quot;, which means less rinsing water! (good for the planet and your pocket). This particular one, the Tea Tree Triple Treat makes you feel like you are in a SPA... its \\&quot;minty\\&quot; scent and feeling on your scalp is refreshing and invigorating, wakes you up in the morning, and relaxes you on an afternoon or night shower. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great value to buy in bulk.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever! The first shampoo that&#x27;s completely cured my dandruff after 25 years of using Head &amp; Shoulders. Plus it helps my prevent breakouts on my face and body (I use it as a body wash). I also use it on my dog who&#x27;s an invalid and kept getting bladder infections. Now that I use this, she&#x27;s never had another infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do eventually get a build-up, but I use a different shampoo for a couple of days and it goes back to working great. It&#x27;s the first tea tree oil shampoo that&#x27;s really worked.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous shampoo.  I have long hair, so I save a lot of money buying the big container (and have fewer plastics to recycle!).</li>
    <li> been using this for a few years now..hair feels softer, I don&#x27;t even need their conditioner, which is also great . usually I don&#x27;t like anything with a scent but this one doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. invigorating as they say. I also buy this large container to help minimize waste, and fill up my older smaller bottles. it is also more cost effective.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. We bought a gallon to fill our Simple Human dispenser. Saves packaging and money.</li>
    <li> At close to $70/gallon including shipping, this stuff isn&#x27;t the cheapest product you can buy.  Yet buying it by the pint is still far more expensive.  This is not a bargain shampoo price, but then again, this isn&#x27;t a bargain shampoo but the bargain comes in how long it will last you.  I have quite short hair but wash and rinse twice daily, and I get about 3-4 months out of a pint of product.  Overall, I&#x27;d say I get about 3 times the mileage per oz than most other shampoos that I&#x27;ve used, with a couple of exceptions that tend to run in the $20/pt range.  And it&#x27;s every bit as good as those are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall color is quite clear.  They have different pics in different places, so if you are seeing a greenish color, this isn&#x27;t what you will get.  I prefer to not have dyes in it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell and feel is very refreshing.  The tea tree benefits are great with elimination of any scalp itching, even during winter and without any feel of oils or conditioners.  The hair still feels quite clean.  The peppermint part of it gives a fantastic wake up call in the morning.  I let it run down onto my face and it does the same thing there that it does for my scalp.  But my guess is that getting this stuff in the eyes would be a real problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you&#x27;re left with at the end is squeaky hair clean and feeling refreshed.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo, love this size.  Just poured it into my old shampoo bottle and I was good to go.  If you&#x27;ve never used this one, its got a fresh minty smell, can tingle if left on too long but cleans effectively and will remove resides built up from other shampoos.  Maybe somewhat drying so you will probably want a conditioner afterward.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo! It has dramatically improved the health of my scalp. It&#x27;s refreshing and soothing. So glad I got it!</li>
    <li> Was happy to find this in bulk.  Kinda expensive, but if you do the math, it&#x27;s cheaper than the little bottles.</li>
    <li> I was looking for original clear shampoo but this is a darker amber color and not same quality as originally purchased from store which was clear. I would not recommend this. Does not get hair squeaky clean or smell same as original clear shampoo as purchased from store first time.</li>
    <li> just like the old redeemable global YUN / YUO Yugoslavia EEU money cash bills  currencies and banknotes ,refreshing theruapatic and invirogating .</li>
    <li> Great product - have used it for years.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for over 5 years.  Help my husband earlier hair loss problem.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, it has no laurel sulfates which cause hair thinning, cleans gently and smells really good.  The tea tree oil causes a slight tingling on the scalp which is invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that it is hard to find the 128 oz size, and the shipping costs tend to be very high.  Obviously the product is worth the price because I keep buying it.</li>
    <li> It may not be sold as dandruff shampoo, but this stuff does the job. Clarifies while offering a pleasant tingling sensation (thanks to the mint extracts). Smells wonderful! Cruelty free and all natural. In this size, you will have enough shampoo for your household for 2-3 years! Pair with the Triple Treat conditioner for dry hair.</li>
    <li> This is the favorite shampoo in our house. It works well, smells good, and leaves your scalp &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34;. While we consider this to be the best attribute of Triple Treat, it is unusual, and not everyone may be as enamored with it as we are. It is available in much smaller quantities, but it&#x27;s considerably more expensive.  This leads to a possible disadvantage of buying this size. It&#x27;s a gallon of shampoo! With as much, or rather as little, hair as I have, this jug could last us a year. On the other hand, it doesn&#x27;t deteriorate on the shelf, so it works for us.</li>
    <li> Short but sweet:  This tea tree shampoo will get your hair clean, wake you up, and not leave heavy perfumes or scents on you.  The scalp tingle from the menthol is pleasantly stimulating, and it rinses out easily and completely.  Recommended.  It meets the Technical Thug test of approval.</li>
    <li> Love the product, the seller not so much. If you actually want Giovanni Tea Tree Triple Treat Shampoo, do not order here. Yes, the name, the picture, and the description all appear to be what you are looking for, but the product shipped is actually Giovanni Smooth As Silk Deep Moisture Shampoo. At first I thought, I ordered the wrong kind, but I went back and verified I did indeed order Giovanni Tea Tree Triple Treat Shampoo. You may think &amp;#34;oh, they just sent her the wrong one, mistakes happen&amp;#34;. Yes, that is reasonable and I thought that as well. So I returned the first one, they credited my card, and I ordered again. The second order came and again it is the incorrect product. Again, it is Giovanni Smooth as Silk Deep Moisture Shampoo. Very irritating and very inconvenient. Save yourself the trouble. I have never had this issue with any other Amazon seller. Just so you know I am not crazy-this was the description of what I ordered:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic Hair Care Tea Tree Triple Treat Enriched with Certified Organic Botanicals Shampoos 128 fl. oz.&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: Beauticonic&lt;br /&gt;$55.95</li>
    <li> I love this brand. So when I saw this Tea Tree shampoo, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy a large size. I bought a pump separately and now I don&#x27;t need to worry about running around looking for this kind of shampoo for a while. The shampoo itself is so great. It leaves your scalp clean and slightly tingling. It&#x27;s very therapeutic for scalp issues like itching and flaking. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo and I am so glad to find such a great price and ordering a gallon was a great idea.</li>
