      <li>and I LOVE it!</li>
      <li>This item is truly amazing.  </li>
      <li>, it produces some nice waves.</li>
      <li>and I was thrilled.  </li>

      <li>after you have let the curls cool off and set, this will make your curls look glossy and beautiful.</li>
      <li>It was barely warm.</li>
      <li>I was imaginging beautiful curls ala Jennifer Aniston at the Golden Globes</li>
      <li>It makes nice waves in my hair which has gotten me many compliments.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair</li>
      <li>However, this product is very cheaply made despite the Vidal Sasson name.</li>
      <li>It was surprising quick.</li>
      <li>, un-do it and wave the top pieces.</li>
      <li>I have had this thing for many years now and it has held up so well.</li>
      <li>It worked a lot better on my hair and created well defined waves.</li>
      <li>ok.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.  </li>
      <li>And if you want to have more defined waves/curls</li>
      <li>so glad I bought the curling iron,</li>
      <li>and I love her wavy hair</li>
      <li>With the Revlon one I have to use mousse and hairspray before using the iron and it holds for most day.</li>
      <li>and you are able to move on to another part of the hair.  </li>
      <li>For some reason I was expecting a bit more of a curl.  </li>
      <li>Stay away from this one, unless you like to look like you stuck your finger in a light socket!</li>
      <li>I got many compliments on my hair style.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Until you get the hang of it, it does make a really cute ponytail.</li>
      <li>If your top has layers like mine, ya might have to develop a knack for that.</li>
      <li>Vidal Sasson VS184C Three-Barrel Waver is an ok product and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I was very excited when I ordered my triple barrel curling iron from Vidal Sasson.  </li>
      <li>It really gives a good wave to my hair.</li>
      <li>one would get from braiding wet hair and then sleeping on it overnight - except 50 times better !!!  </li>
      <li>It is sooo easy to use.  </li>
      <li>iron is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair, but lots of it.</li>
      <li>fine hair is what I have.  </li>
      <li>My tip: clip up the top of your hair and do bottom layers first, working your way up to the top.</li>
      <li>When you combine the VS volumizing line of products with this amazing iron, the results are nothing short of SPECTACULAR.</li>
      <li>It gave me smooth wavy curls.    </li>
      <li>It looks fabulous</li>
      <li>I can go from smooth and sleek in the day to bouncy and wavy by night when I hit the scene.</li>
      <li>I would reccommend using a shine spray before using any curling iron, and then a light hairspray before curling the hair, then spray shine spray in the hair again</li>
      <li>This is a great product for people who want big hair.</li>
      <li>I have naturally straight, fine hair, which curls very easily.</li>
      <li>I do not recomend this for anyone that does not have hair that is just super easy to curl.</li>
      <li>I can just pin up the top layer and curl the inner most layer to create a look with good volume but straight hair.     </li>
      <li>waver/curling iron like that for a long time, and when I got this product and tried it out, the results were great</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so excited about this waving iron.</li>
      <li>I originally wanted to go with the hot tools three barrel waver, but this SEEMED like a better buy.</li>
      <li>When I first bought this waver, I was very excited.</li>
      <li>Use more hair in each section you style at a time for a looser more natural look.</li>
      <li>However, it comes pretty handy when I want some volume in my fine straight hair.</li>
      <li>Whether you are going to the office or want a special style for that special night, this is the tool for you.</li>
      <li>This is a really cool waver-it doesn&#x27;t create curls, it creats really cool waves.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for &#x27;a head full of luscious curls&#x27; as advertised, you&#x27;re out of luck.</li>
      <li>My dissapointment is overwhelming and I look foward to buying a new waver with the help of amazon reviews!</li>
      <li>I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this iron to someone who is not used to spending a lot of time on their hair and is very skilled at using all kinds of hair appliances.  </li>
      <li>It does not get very hot, which is why it did not work on my hair.  </li>
      <li>it does not work and it doesnt heat up very hot at all.</li>
      <li>Too hot!</li>
      <li>, exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>It takes a while to heat up, but when it does, boy does it get hot!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had fine, straight hair.</li>
      <li>This works wonders on my straight, fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I have fine, but not thin color treated,blonde hair.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t have to hold it for long on my hair, Love it!</li>
      <li>You know, I was watching GILMORE GIRLS the other night and really loved the way that Lorelei was wearing her hair.  </li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this product if you want to give your hair sweet and sexy look.</li>
      <li>However..... after constant finger tousling to create ringlets, and use of pomades, I was able to get a more natural look that i was aiming for.</li>

      <li>But, luckily there are a whole line of products to protect your hair from heat damage.  </li>
      <li>All in all, it was pretty rubbish.  </li>
      <li>There hasn&#x27;t been any flaking off of the metal, it never gets so hot to where it burns my hair.</li>
      <li>As soon as I started using it, even with Big Sexy Hair hairspray (which works sooo well)</li>
      <li>I bought this Vidal Sassoon 3 barrel curling iron and used it last night, and I love it</li>
      <li>I bought this after using  a friends hot tools curler.</li>
      <li>I think this product would be a lot better if the barrel was a bit bigger, otherwise, I agree that it is comparable to crimping.</li>
      <li>When I first saw this waver and the GREAT price, I decided to overlook the negative reviews and try it out for myself.</li>
      <li>When I first tried it, my hair looked frizzy and I gave up on it for awhile.</li>
      <li>I think this product would be a lot better if the barrel was a bit bigger, otherwise, I agree that it is comparable to the 80&#x27;s crimping iron.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if either I&#x27;m completely inept at doing my hair or this thing is just incredibly tricky to use.  </li>
      <li>but I am no longer interested.</li>
      <li>I would go for the Revlon 3-barrel Jumbo Waver over this (or something similar looking), which I think I&#x27;m about to try (the barrels seem a lot thicker and better placed</li>
      <li>It makes really pretty rolling waves in your hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was so bummed when they stopped selling these in stores in my area!  Then I found this on Amazon for less than they had been in the stores, and I snatched it up. It works wonderfully and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase :)</li>
    <li> I have long straight hair and was tired of the same old look. So I figured hang up the flat iron and get me a 3 barrel waver. Was so excited to achieve a different hairstyle than my usual without having to pull out the curling iron (and 1 1/2 hours). I ended up purchasing the VS waver due to the good price soon to find out that there is a reason that the price is so low- the thing doesn&#x27;t work!!! It did nothing for my hair. It didnt give me waves at all. Nothing. I even tried holding it in my hair longer. But that didn&#x27;t work either. Would put it in my hair and count to 30 before moving it and if anything it made my hair frizz at that point. I do not recomend this for anyone that does not have hair that is just super easy to curl. Because chances are, unless your hair takes to heat REALLY well, this will do nothing for you but add to your day&#x27;s frustration and damage your hair.</li>
    <li> I thought this product would give me loose, natural waves like Shakira&#x27;s &#x27;do, but i was a bit disappointed when the waves were small and unnatural looking.  After I was done with my whole head, which took me close to 2 hours since I have thick Asian hair, my hair was so bushy i looked like i had an afro.  However.....  after constant finger tousling to create ringlets, and use of pomades, I was able to get a more natural look that i was aiming for.  I think this product would be a lot better if the barrel was a bit bigger, otherwise, I agree that it is comparable to crimping.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something &amp;quot;different&amp;quot; without going to a salon. I just got over a drying perm from October. I have fine, but not thin color treated,blonde hair. Was a bit scared of the size of this thing, but....oooh...how shiny...had to buy it. Well, everyone loves my hair!!  My husband says I look 5 yrs younger, hey &amp;quot;Are you leaving the house looking that good?&amp;quot; You know....It gives me loose perm like waves,last til the next day. Take a little styling spray to the underneath &amp;amp; wow !!! If your top has layers like mine, ya might have to develop a knack for that. Mine&#x27;s great ! I luv luv luv it !!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product works so awesome for the price!!! I already have the \\&quot;Revlon RV084 3-Barrel Jumbo Waver with Ceramic\\&quot; and this one works even better! I have fine hair, but lots of it. It doesn&#x27;t usually hold a curl. With the Revlon one I have to use mousse and hairspray before using the iron and it holds for most day. I tried THIS ONE with NOTHING in my hair and spent half the time I needed with the Revlon iron, just playing with it. The wave has stayed in all day long and everyone asks me if I have a perm! I love it. I even noticed I still had waves then next morning before my shower!&lt;br /&gt;  My tip: clip up the top of your hair and do bottom layers first, working your way up to the top. If you have hair like mine, be prepared to spend about 25 min on dry hair using the high setting. I&#x27;m so excited about this waving iron.</li>
    <li> I am a Professional platform artist. I have been trying out various irons so that I may promote the tools that work to my  clientele, from all around the United States, which of them was the smart buy. Plain and simple  this iron does not work. Stay far away!</li>
    <li> When I first bought this waver, I was very excited. All of my friends \\&quot;wave\\&quot; their hair and I wanted to try it. When I started using this, my friend warned me three-barrel wavers don&#x27;t work very well and take a very long time. I blew off her negativity only to find that she was correct. As soon as I started using it, even with Big Sexy Hair hairspray (which works sooo well) my waves fell out when I was almost done. They looked cheap, thin, and unatrractive. It took me an HOUR to do this and it was a waist of my time. My dissapointment is overwhelming and I look foward to buying a new waver with the help of amazon reviews!</li>
    <li> I also saw this product used by Paula on the Real World Key West and I love her wavy hair so I thought I&#x27;d try this out for a cheap enough price.  I have super thick hair which can be slightly wavy if I let it dry naturally but I also have some straight sections too.  This waver made my hair look like I have a loose perm, I love it.  And if you want to have more defined waves/curls you can scrunch in some mouse or whatever styling product you prefer.  My hair is about four inches past my shoulders and it took me 30 minutes to do all of it, but like I said my hair is very thick.  This is a great way to get wavy hair with the permanence of a perm.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 years. When I first tried it, my hair looked frizzy and I gave up on it for awhile. I didnt realize you do not brush it out at all or do any comb work. I use Aussie Scrunch spray to lift and hold. It takes almost an hour to do my whole head, but it stays all night when I go out which is difficult for my hair type. If I do it for work, I french braid my hair the night before then in the morning, un-do it and wave the top pieces. It looks fabulous, I get compliments EVERY time I do my hair this way and my friends always borrow it!!!</li>
    <li> I love wave irons!  I was a bit skeptical at first after I had a bad experience with a crimping iron!  I went from sleek to fro in five minutes!  The wave iron works great, especially if you have fine or thin hair and desperately want to add some volume to your hair.  It takes a while to heat up, but when it does, boy does it get hot!  Too hot! But, luckily there are a whole line of products to protect your hair from heat damage.  Combined with heat protector spray and a soft hold hairspay this curling iron will do wonders on your hair.  I can go from smooth and sleek in the day to bouncy and wavy by night when I hit the scene. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I ordered the three-barrel waver iron after seeing it on \\&quot;The Real World.\\&quot; And it&#x27;s...ok. I was imaginging beautiful curls ala Jennifer Aniston at the Golden Globes and I got two weak little waves. They were barely better than a rubber band crimp!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This waver works great!  My daughter has thick, naturally straight hair and this waver works great on her hair.  I just hairspray a thin layer, brush it, and wave it.  It doesn&#x27;t take much time and stays in if you use hairspray.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and it is nearly impossible for me to find anything that actually works as far as curling it. I just ordered this and tried it out and I LOVE it! It gives the cutest curly/wavy look. It takes a little getting used to since it is so much larger than a regular curling iron, but it is really simple to use. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with fine hair.    It didn&#x27;t make me look like a poodle at all. It did have a sort of cross between a curl and a crimp look but I like it. Also, it didn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy either. It gave me smooth wavy curls.    The only con for me is that the wave plate is so large that it&#x27;s easy to burn yourself. I accidentally burned my neck with it one day and it burned pretty bad after only touching the skin for a second. I have to be VERY careful with it now.</li>
    <li> Vidal Sasson VS184C Three-Barrel Waver is an ok product and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It makes nice waves in my hair which has gotten me many compliments. However, this product is very cheaply made despite the Vidal Sasson name. One would expect quality from this item but that&#x27;s not the case. The first time I used the Waver, the little black plastic grip piece on the handle that opens the barrel broke off. Also because of the poor positioning of the heat setting switch, my thumb constantly hits against it and because of this I unknowingly end up turning down the temperature or turning the Waver off while I&#x27;m using it. Now I have electrical tape where the broken off plastic grip used to be so that I don&#x27;t burn my thumb and I also put some around the temperate switch so that it can keep it&#x27;s position without the fear of it sliding down into the low or off position.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame that the quality is so bad because, like I said before, it produces some nice waves. I&#x27;ll be getting another waver but not a Vidal Sasson.</li>
    <li> You know, I was watching GILMORE GIRLS the other night and really loved the way that Lorelei was wearing her hair.  I wondered how she did that.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I happened to be in CVS today and saw this triple barrel waving iron and I was thrilled.  I figured that it would achieve the look I was eager to try.&lt;br /&gt;I have already been completely amazed at the VS volumizing line of products for hair which accomplish what NO OTHER HAIR CARE SYSTEM OF ANY PRICE HAS BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH EVER.&lt;br /&gt;Well, let me tell you.  When you combine the VS volumizing line of products with this amazing iron, the results are nothing short of SPECTACULAR. (if you use the products, let the company know, they are thinking of discontinuing them, because of lousy advertising-hardly anyone knows how amazing they are)&lt;br /&gt;Baby fine hair is what I have.  After using the combination of the hair products and this three barrel waver iron, I look like I just got a perm and have thick hair.  And it stays like that all day, in fact so far up to three days without rewaving.&lt;br /&gt;The iron is easy to use.  Because it only does a single layer of hair at a time, you do not need to leave it in as long as a curling iron.  10-15 seconds and you are able to move on to another part of the hair.  To do my complete hair, it is 10 -15 minutes tops.&lt;br /&gt;There are two heat settings.  Either setting is fine.&lt;br /&gt;I can not rave about this iron enough, and the VS products which make it work especially well with thin fine hair.</li>
    <li> Used it once, but it does work well.. if you know what your doing.. which I dont.. haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ma</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE. NEVER EVER EVER BUY.</li>
    <li> This item is truly amazing.  I love it.  I have fine straight asian hair.  However, within 8 minutes, I can transform my pin straight hair into a headful of wavy curls.  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.  I am considering buying another iron as a reserve in case mine is lost or becomes broken.  I would be absolutely devastated if Vidal Sassoon discontinued producing this product.  The curls I have gotten are similar to the type of curls one would get from braiding wet hair and then sleeping on it overnight - except 50 times better !!!  Give this product a try ... its amazing !!!!</li>
    <li> Ugh!  I was excited to use this when I received it some years ago but was very disappointed with the results.  The \\&quot;waves\\&quot; come out very unnatural looking, more like a cross between a crimp and a curl.  In fact, I think I&#x27;d actually prefer using a crimper over this thing, if you can imagine that!  Just very unflattering.  The size of the barrels are just much too thin and I think if it had a thicker barrel it might be nice.  However, the iron only has 2 heat settings, which also is a big minus.  If you have thin, fine hair this might be OK (or, just not AS bad), but if your hair is normal or as thick as mine, DON&#x27;T EVEN TRY IT!  I would go for the Revlon 3-barrel Jumbo Waver over this (or something similar looking), which I think I&#x27;m about to try (the barrels seem a lot thicker and better placed I think I could achieve the natural wavy look I&#x27;m trying for). So I would pass on this VS product.</li>
    <li> This is just like a crimper, and that, we already have.  Not sure if a more expensive one would do the trick or not but I am no longer interested.</li>
    <li> Since my hair is pin-straight, I totally gave up on curling my tresses.  However, when my friend insisted that I tried this product, I was in awe. This product is not only small enough to fit in my travel bag, but also left my hair with bouncy curls with definition and shine.  I highly suggest anyone who is considering to curl there hair, but has doubts because of their straight hair.  Go buy this and prove yourself wrong!</li>
    <li> I was at first skeptical about a three-barreled curling iron.  It seemed like a basic crimper.  WOW was I wrong.  My hair is straight and thick.  I wanted something to make it look defined and polished.  The iron transformed my hair into shiny, silky strands.  The waves are beautifully &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; shaped and can be as formal or funky as you want. It is sooo easy to use.  It heats up almost instantly(plus there is low and high setting for different hair types)  It was surprising quick. Whether you are going to the office or want a special style for that special night, this is the tool for you.</li>
    <li> This works wonders on my straight, fine hair.  Can be glamerous or funky.  Only 4 stars due to the fact that it is difficult to master, but it is well worth the practice.  Until you get the hang of it, it does make a really cute ponytail.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had fine, straight hair. In the 80s, I used perms to help, but I didn&#x27;t want to fry my hair the rest of my life, so I looked for alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went through all kinds of styling tools from [[ASIN:B00022WA9U Revlon RV261 20-Roller Ionic Professional Hairsetter]] to [[ASIN:B00009OTGU Conair CD103JCS Satin Finish 1-1/2-Inch Ceramic Curling Iron]], and then some...even hair products like [[ASIN:B000XXZ1C6 Aussie Instant Freeze Hair Spray Extreme 7 oz.]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally stumbled across this triple-barrel iron. While it takes much longer to style my hair, it doesn&#x27;t fall flat after only a few hours...in fact, I&#x27;ve had my waves last overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend it to someone who is in a hurry, or anyone with shoulder-length or shorter hair...if you don&#x27;t have long hair, using this iron will make you look ridiculous.</li>
    <li> I didnt buy this product off amazon but i did buy the same exact one in the store. I have thick long hair. it does not work and it doesnt heat up very hot at all. there are only certain settings. i wouldnt recommend spenging your money on this product at all. a waving curling iron if you are looking for great results is something you might want to plan on spenging a little extra money for.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I ordered my triple barrel curling iron from Vidal Sasson.  I immidiatly tried it, and followed all of the instructions.  I have thick hair and I was very surprised how well it worked on my hair.  However, after I used it it had a crimp like effect, but slightly bigger waves.  If this is the look your going for, this is perfect for you!</li>
    <li> I used a friend&#x27;s triple barrel fancy curling iron.  I got lovely clean waves that still left my hair shiny but gave me waves, like the bird in the Pantene ad who is wandering down the stairs.  It was fab.  This nonsense made my hair frizzy and didn&#x27;t really give me waves but a really ugly ball of mess.    All in all, it was pretty rubbish.  Don&#x27;t recommend it. Another bloody hair implement destined for the basket of no use!</li>
    <li> I bought this after using  a friends hot tools curler.I will return it, it just gave me a crimped, poodle style effect. Stay away from this one, unless you like to look like you stuck your finger in a light socket!</li>
    <li> I bought this Vidal Sassoon 3 barrel curling iron and used it last night, and I love it, the curls look so good, it didn&#x27;t make me hair frizzy at all. I would reccommend using a shine spray before using any curling iron, and then a light hairspray before curling the hair, then spray shine spray in the hair again after you have let the curls cool off and set, this will make your curls look glossy and beautiful. I m so glad I bought the curling iron, cause I was going crazy not knowing what to do with my chin length bob, and now I have a solution to my problem.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000065DK4 Vidal Sasson VS184C Gold Series Professional Three-Barrel Waver]]    This product is a waste of money, it overheats and smokes and burns out your hair. This product is a household hazard and do not recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> This is a really cool waver-it doesn&#x27;t create curls, it creats really cool waves. I used this for new years and my waves stayed the entire night! didn&#x27;t have to hold it for long on my hair, Love it!</li>
    <li> I have really thick, hard to curl, dry, asian hair. This iron did not work for me at all.  The iron did not get hot enough to do anything. I guess it would work if I did small one-inch sections, but I have so much hair, it&#x27;s just not worth the time.  The waves it did create were fizzy and ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend, who has thin hair, uses this iron all the time and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the Hot Tools Deep Waver.  It worked a lot better on my hair and created well defined waves.</li>
    <li> I have had this thing for many years now and it has held up so well. There hasn&#x27;t been any flaking off of the metal, it never gets so hot to where it burns my hair. It really gives a good wave to my hair. Use more hair in each section you style at a time for a looser more natural look.</li>
    <li> For some reason I was expecting a bit more of a curl.  Instead, I ended up with a flashback to 4th grade and the crimping iron.  This didn&#x27;t give curls, it just crimps on a larger scale.  I felt much like my parents&#x27; poodle after just a few sections.  If you&#x27;re looking for a wider crimped look, this is perfect.  If you&#x27;re looking for &#x27;a head full of luscious curls&#x27; as advertised, you&#x27;re out of luck.</li>
    <li> I thought this product would give me loose, natural waves like Shakira&#x27;s &#x27;do, but i was a bit disappointed when the waves were small and unnatural looking. After I was done with my whole head, which took me close to 2 hours since I have thick Asian hair, my hair was so bushy i looked like i had an afro. However..... after constant finger tousling to create ringlets, and use of pomades, I was able to get a more natural look that i was aiming for. I think this product would be a lot better if the barrel was a bit bigger, otherwise, I agree that it is comparable to the 80&#x27;s crimping iron.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if either I&#x27;m completely inept at doing my hair or this thing is just incredibly tricky to use.  Nonetheless, the result that I&#x27;ve gotten has been very disappointing.  I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this iron to someone who is not used to spending a lot of time on their hair and is very skilled at using all kinds of hair appliances.  I think that this item will now sit in a closet never to be seen again...</li>
    <li> This is a great product for people who want big hair. It can really make your hair big especially for those who with fine hair like me. One thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that iron is really not hot enough and heats up relatively slowly comparing to my conair flatener. Because it&#x27;s not hot enough, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to work well on thick hair.    I don&#x27;t really use this iron to create a wavy look because I like big waves and this product can only make small waves. However, it comes pretty handy when I want some volume in my fine straight hair. I can just pin up the top layer and curl the inner most layer to create a look with good volume but straight hair.     Overall, it&#x27;s worth the $14</li>
    <li> When I first saw this waver and the GREAT price, I decided to overlook the negative reviews and try it out for myself. I originally wanted to go with the hot tools three barrel waver, but this SEEMED like a better buy. PLEASE do not follow my footsteps.     When I first got my package, I saw that this was not the same waver I had ordered. I was thinking that I would be receiving the waver in the photo- with a gold coating. Instead I received a waver with a metal coating. This coating is HORRIBLE. It has a texture that makes you hair stick to the waver (not smooth at all) which makes it very difficult to slide your hair down.     Then when I turned it on, I used the high setting- which was a joke. It was barely warm. I tried to use it on my hair. I have naturally straight, fine hair, which curls very easily. I had to take a tiny section of hair, clamp down with the waver, and hold for about 50 seconds till I can unclamp and move down the strand. There is a cute wave for about five minutes, but regardless of how much product you use, there is simply not enough heat to keep the waves in your hair.     PLEASE don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!</li>
    <li> This is a gift I got for my youngest daughter.  She loves it and it works very well.  It makes really pretty rolling waves in your hair.</li>
    <li> Works well, once you learn how to use it properly.  Play around and try different ways.  Arrived on time and as described.</li>
    <li> not for everyday use but it&#x27;s kinda cool to have a curling iron that makes your hair look crazy cool</li>
    <li> I was not happy with this curling iron.  I have thick hair, and it did not even make a dent in my hair.  It does not get very hot, which is why it did not work on my hair.  If you have thick hair I would not waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> This thing is absolutely amazing!!! I have been looking for a hair waver/curling iron like that for a long time, and when I got this product and tried it out, the results were great, exactly what I was looking for! I got many compliments on my hair style. I would definitely recommend this product if you want to give your hair sweet and sexy look.</li>
