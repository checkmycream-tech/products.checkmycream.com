<li> I don&#x27;t see this product in stores anymore, and there were only a few on Amazon.  </li>
<li> well but wondering if the fragrance may be the cause as I&#x27;ve never used powder so highly scented nor have I broken out like this from any makeup before.</li>

<li> Sadly, the company has decided to &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; the line and now the liquid foundations (all supposedly now reduce spots) are runny and sticky.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too bad; Physician&#x27;s Formula is always discontinuing products that work well.  </li>

    <li> This product says it&#x27;s good for sensitive skin but it caused the worst allergic reaction &amp; rash on my face I&#x27;ve ever had. It smells great &amp; covers well but wondering if the fragrance may be the cause as I&#x27;ve never used powder so highly scented nor have I broken out like this from any makeup before. I would recommend trying it on small area before entire face to avoid possible embarrassing rash like it caused on my face!</li>
    <li> got mines and it was all broken it was all loose powder still used it but was upset</li>
    <li> I have used the &amp;#34;Youthful Wear&amp;#34; products from Physicians Formula for several years and have been very pleased with the product and the results. Sadly, the company has decided to &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; the line and now the liquid foundations (all supposedly now reduce spots) are runny and sticky. The original youthful wear foundation is just right if you can still find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This powder though is still great! I use the translucent which works on most people. It goes on well and doesn&#x27;t change color. Really hope they don&#x27;t screw up this formula too.</li>
    <li> Just buy it. All the reviews are right. This stuff is fantastic. I especially like that I can put it on over tinted moisturizer &amp; cream blush and it doesn&#x27;t take away the dewy effect.</li>
    <li> When I put it on for the first time, my sister asked&amp;#34; what have you had done to your face?!&amp;#34; She thought I had some kind of a special treatment - it looked so good. This powder covers up minor imperfections and it definitely gives you a beautiful glow. I bough these for my sister, my mom, and my baby sitter, and they all love it.</li>
    <li> i would like it if not for the shimmers. i read the reviews before i purchased some were saying it makes their skin really pretty, i don&#x27;t like the shimmers on my face, maybe as a highlighter but shimmers around my mouth and stuff is not pretty. lol. i was so excited to use it i dipped my brush and then buffed it all over and looked in the mirror, i was like WHOA!!! lol.</li>
    <li> I love this brand and its products. These powders are wonderful, I have already purchased 3 times! The coverage is divine and the color is adjusted totally to my skin. It´s price is supremely economic. I do not change for anything in the world. I recommend without restrictions.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite setting powders. I use it more than my MAC Mineralize Skin finish. I love the texture and the smell. It has a slight shimmer running through it, but it doesn&#x27;t really show up on the face. However, I have noticed that I leave shimmer on my nieces and nephews after I snuggle with them...which isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing. ;)</li>
    <li> Cannot find this product in stores and I love it. Makes a nice matt finish with a shimmer. Covers blemishes and looks great on.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Use it without foundation.  It does make the skin look younger!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see this product in stores anymore, and there were only a few on Amazon.  It&#x27;s too bad; Physician&#x27;s Formula is always discontinuing products that work well.  I like this powder better than the BB Powder by PF.  I use it after applying foundation, and then again after applying bronzer and blush to finish.  Despite all that powder, it never looks powdery, just very natural.  I get compliments on how smooth my skin is when I wear this along with a good foundation.  This product does just what it says - boosts a more youthful appearance.</li>
    <li> I love this powder, seriously! It&#x27;s great and physician&#x27;s formula makes such great cosmetics you basically can&#x27;t go wrong when you buy their cosmetics.</li>
    <li> I wear it without a foundation and I love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, not great but ok</li>
    <li> it has some kind of fragrance. it&#x27;s better than physicians organic series but it still smells strong.&lt;br /&gt;i liked their healthy wear foundation series but i am getting disappointed by them because of the smell on other products.... it just smells like old peoples make up...</li>
