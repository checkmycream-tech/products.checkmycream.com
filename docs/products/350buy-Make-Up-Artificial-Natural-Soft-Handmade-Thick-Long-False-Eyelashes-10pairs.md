      <li>If you are looking for more realistic lashes then these are not for you</li>

      <li>I got ready for a night out and was so excited to wear these.</li>
      <li>wasnt even the right lashes that was in the picture.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re easy to apply, fantastic for the price and the look is total glamour on a shoestring budget.  </li>
      <li>As seen in pic very thick band make sure you have good glue would but from again.  </li>
      <li>What you see in the pic is exactly what you get.</li>
      <li>This was not the first time I have ordered these.  </li>
      <li>ok for costume wear, but not for daily.  </li>
      <li>they also stay on the whole day! 😀</li>
      <li>and it took me exactly 4 weeks to receive them.</li>
      <li>They looked so pretty in the picture, but when I got them</li>
      <li>This time, and most of the time, they arrive with the box smashed, which crushes the  lashes flat, so then they have no curl.</li>
      <li>The case you get with it is very helpful and it will most likely not got damaged.</li>
      <li>They were large, gaudy &amp; bushy.</li>
      <li>The box I received were plasticky lashes, but it was too much of a hassle to ship them back since they were really cheap.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like them to much</li>
      <li>so they hold up really well.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think much of the reviews</li>
      <li>The ones i was sent are much thicker.</li>
      <li>to cut it so it would fit properly on my lids..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much easier to put on if you don&#x27;t have a tool to help.</li>
      <li>i was really displeased when i got my package &#x3D;</li>
      <li>They are very lightweight which I like</li>
      <li>i love the design of the eyelashes and they are very soft and long, they look so natural on my eyes.</li>
      <li>I was very surprised at how fast it got here.</li>
      <li>You have to trim them, becuase they are a bit long, but i think they are well worth the price and wait!</li>
      <li>and they last so much longer then the ones I buy at the beauty supply store for $2 each.</li>
      <li>DO NOT BUY if you are looking for soft lashes.</li>
      <li>how they really look aren&#x27;t the same.</li>
      <li>Shipping was early though.</li>
      <li>The only reason I gave 3 stars because shipping was fast &amp; they fully refunded me.</li>
      <li>the only thing is that ladies...if you are looking for these right away, I advise you to just go to a local walgreens or cvs or hair supply store for the time being because these come all the way from hong kong</li>
      <li>Easy to put on too, because they have a little extra at the ends you can hold on to at each end that doesn&#x27;t have the lash on, so</li>
      <li>They actually look very natural upon application.</li>
      <li>I was to lazy to try to clean it out</li>
      <li>These are so hard you can&#x27;t get them to fit.  </li>
      <li>not least I&#x27;m not going to rate the product itself harshly because it very well could be me.</li>
      <li>I guess the amount I recieved was worth the dollar also expect to wait at least a month for your product though that wasnt a problem for me because I ordered them just to try something new</li>
      <li>I love really dramatic eyelashes</li>
      <li>definitely full and thick...</li>
      <li>I thought despite the other reviews, I thought they would be decent enough to wear</li>

    <li> These are great lashes, yet they really need to figure out a different way to ship them.  This was not the first time I have ordered these.  This time, and most of the time, they arrive with the box smashed, which crushes the  lashes flat, so then they have no curl. Its not easy to get a natural looking curl in them with a lash curler.</li>
    <li> Looking too fake. I had to cut a lot off to make it look more natural.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get these lashes! They looked so pretty in the picture, but when I got them I was so upset. I received the package all smashed, so I opened it and the lashes where smashed all different ways it ruined about 4 sets do to the condition of how the package was received.</li>
    <li> I loved these eye lashes..trully makes your eye stand out and the look is jyst glamerous. I will surely reorder these..</li>
    <li> They were thick stiff but not to stiff and they last so much longer then the ones I buy at the beauty supply store for $2 each. I have used just one pair of these for the last 7 days and I take them off every night except last night I slept in them and I woke up and they looked perfect they didn&#x27;t bend even a little. I love love love.</li>
    <li> They are Awsome ,it actually works really good they also stay on the whole day! 😀👀</li>
    <li> These eyelashes were great for the price. Just get some good adhesive, and you&#x27;re set to go. Great for going out.</li>
    <li> Great buy for the price! Bought these to have a little back up stash for emergencies &amp; for friends. Obviously not the best lashed i&#x27;ve used,  but for the price they are great. I mean come on people, your getting 10 pairs for under 2 bucks! Not gonna be top notch! Good for the price &amp; they arrived two weeks earlier than estimated date. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> When I received these lashes I was in utter shock ! They were not the ones in the photograph. They were large, gaudy &amp; bushy. Shipping was early though. I contacted the company and they got back to me within 2 days and they gave me a full refund, do not get these. It isn&#x27;t the ones in the picture. The only reason I gave 3 stars because shipping was fast &amp; they fully refunded me.</li>
    <li> Aaaaaaa no got here fast bit looked to fake they don&#x27;t stay on had to put them on over and over till I just took them off and threw them away</li>
    <li> their a little stiff but you are suppose to play with them a little and loosen them up. after all I love these. the only thing is that ladies...if you are looking for these right away, I advise you to just go to a local walgreens or cvs or hair supply store for the time being because these come all the way from hong kong and it took me exactly 4 weeks to receive them. another thing, I order 4 packs at the same time and got one pack at a time with weeks of each other</li>
    <li> Super plasticky. The last ones I ordered from a Chinese seller were too so I didn&#x27;t think much of the reviews but these are totally inferior quality.</li>
    <li> this are really nice eyelashes look really nice when you have in the are easy to put and easy to take the glu and reuse</li>
    <li> The box I received were plasticky lashes, but it was too much of a hassle to ship them back since they were really cheap.  DO NOT BUY if you are looking for soft lashes.</li>
    <li> Was trying to do something new... FAILURE! I may be doing something wrong but im going to stick to mascara overall I guess the amount I recieved was worth the dollar also expect to wait at least a month for your product though that wasnt a problem for me because I ordered them just to try something new last but not least I&#x27;m not going to rate the product itself harshly because it very well could be me.</li>
    <li> Lashed were delivered to me as described. They looked just like the picture. Very easy to apply. They actually look very natural upon application. I would order this product again. The lashes also arrived before the expected delivery date, which was a plus.</li>
    <li> There ok doable looking for better quality to satisfy my quench but will work im teaching 15 year old how to put them on</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like them is hard to bend and they&#x27;re super thick</li>
    <li> These are so hard you can&#x27;t get them to fit.  It&#x27;s a waste of money. Threw them in trash.  Terrible.</li>
    <li> Not what they appear to be. Wouldn&#x27;t buy them again the picture and how they really look aren&#x27;t the same. False advertisement</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are average. I like how flexible they are.</li>
    <li> i love the design of the eyelashes and they are very soft and long, they look so natural on my eyes.</li>
    <li> They came sooner than I was supposed to get them, although they still took awhile to come in but that&#x27;s okay. These eyelashes are great especially for the price. If you know how to work with eyelashes, then you shouldn&#x27;t have any issues! I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I know I ordered these from abroad and paid next to nothing for them but they definitely missed a step on the assembly line.  They are very lightweight which I like but I have yet to trust them to stay in place for long periods of time without an excessive amount of DUO.</li>
    <li> Bought to take to shop,shop said their pretty but hard to adhere</li>
    <li> They are startting to be very poor quality</li>
    <li> these are really wide that i had to cut the ends off. but for the price i really liked them. i got the ten pack.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been since September that I had to receive the lashes it&#x27;s already going to be November! People suck at This</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like them to much</li>
    <li> these lashes finally arrived a month late however they are here and a bit scary.....definitely full and thick...I wore a pair and trulyfelt like I had on something different...they are not spiked as this picture portrays..;</li>
    <li> the lashes were too thick at the bottom to lay properly on the eye lid so they did not stay on eye</li>
    <li> The lashes that came weren&#x27;t what I expected to receive due to the picture shown. They sent me the one that were thicker I won&#x27;t waste them but I wish the would have received what I ordered. :-(</li>
    <li> wasnt even the right lashes that was in the picture. i was really displeased when i got my package &#x3D;[</li>
    <li> Dont buy them there ugly you don&#x27;t get what you think you&#x27;re getting it&#x27;s just a waste of money. Yuk</li>
    <li> for the price, 10 pairs is great! a bit dramatic but i could get used to them. they&#x27;re just a bit too hard to put on because of the material its made of</li>
    <li> I didnt get these lashes in this picture, that I ordered, they sent thick and long lashes. I still like them for the price I spent.</li>
    <li> The eyelashed i got don&#x27;t look like the picture shown. The ones i was sent are much thicker. Aside from that however, they are very good quality lashes! You have to trim them, becuase they are a bit long, but i think they are well worth the price and wait!</li>
    <li> Double-banded, soft and long, you would pay about $10.00 minimum retail for a single pair of these. Why would anyone do that? I don&#x27;t know...buy them here.</li>
    <li> The price is very reasonable for the amount of lashes you receive ,I am really enjoying my eyelashes, I told my daughter about these lashes and she started ordering her some eyelashes</li>
    <li> I love these lashes!  They&#x27;re easy to apply, fantastic for the price and the look is total glamour on a shoestring budget.  A win win for any girl...</li>
    <li> The eyelash band is hard and thick. The eyelash themselves are thick and not like the picture. I thought despite the other reviews, I thought they would be decent enough to wear but I was unable to use them. The shipping took a long time but I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT DEAL FOR EXCELLENT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> As seen in pic very thick band make sure you have good glue would but from again.  If you are looking for more realistic lashes then these are not for you</li>
    <li> These lashes came to me in about two weeks. They are not natural looking,  but I bought these to practice on, so I guess they are fine. If you are looking for lashes to wear out, I would not recommend these.</li>
    <li> Could not and can not put them on.  I got ready for a night out and was so excited to wear these. I  tried putting them on and no matter how hard I tried they would not stay. Needless to say I had to redo my eye makeup and no lashes. A few days later my friend (who wears them) tried too and couldn&#x27;t either she said they are too stiff.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I love really dramatic eyelashes so these were perfect for me. And I have big blue eyes so I don&#x27;t need to cut them or anything like that. I usually can reuse one pair about 5 times before I throw them out so they hold up really well. My favorite lash glue comes from Revlon and it goes perfectly with these lashes and any lashes really. I&#x27;ve ordered form them before and I&#x27;ve been happy everytime I&#x27;ve ordered from them. And you can&#x27;t beat the price for how many pairs you get. Love them!</li>
    <li> These super suck! They are stiff and plastic... Did not go on at all and would probably take weave glue to hold. I am very disappointed</li>
    <li> Worst item iv ever purchased, the lashes are all different from one another , i dont recommend it to anyone looking for goo quality lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed with what I got</li>
    <li> I understand the fact that they&#x27;re false, b ut these lashes looked too false. They were too long and stiff which made it hard to stay on. Wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift.  Wrong type.  Put in costume trunk.  :)</li>
    <li> The lashes are very cheap and does not look good. It is hard to apply and stay on because of the material.&lt;br /&gt;I use fake lashes a lot and I thought it was a good deal, but there is a reason why it is so cheap. It would work as an accessory for halloween costume perfect but not for a going out look.</li>
    <li> Very dark and thick lashes. Unfortunately, they were a bit too loud for my liking. However, I gave them to my sister and she LOVES THEM!</li>
    <li> They were plastic and completely cheap. Didn&#x27;t wanna stick even with the expensive glue. The lash line was too thick.  The ones on thread are much better (:</li>
    <li> I love these lashes! They are very full and thick but not too thick to the point where you automatically know they are fake. They are extremely gorgeous and will help give that cute ulzzang effect. I was very surprised at how fast it got here. What you see in the pic is exactly what you get. The case you get with it is very helpful and it will most likely not got damaged. If you are looking for a great deal on great lashes, you should definitely buy these!!!</li>
    <li> For the price, these are wonderful. I was even able to reuse them a couple of times before getting eye shadow in them and desiding I was to lazy to try to clean it out</li>
    <li> ive bought a few times I believe... and they got worse each time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure where all the negative reviews come from. These are very soft and very thick. Easy to put on too, because they have a little extra at the ends you can hold on to at each end that doesn&#x27;t have the lash on, so It&#x27;s much easier to put on if you don&#x27;t have a tool to help. They are very LONG so if you are trying for a more natural look, I&#x27;d steer clear of these, but if you want that Gyaru/Lolita eye look then these are perfect :)</li>
    <li> I GOT WRONG LASHES AND BESIDES THAT I RECEIVED THE PACKAGE SMASHED SO COULDN&#x27;T EVEN USED THE EYE LASHES. NEVER ORDERING AGAIN</li>
    <li> ok for costume wear, but not for daily.  Too heavy and don&#x27;t look natural.</li>
    <li> i wear to work everyday!&lt;br /&gt;easy to apply and to remove!&lt;br /&gt;needed to cut it so it would fit properly on my lids..</li>
</ol>
