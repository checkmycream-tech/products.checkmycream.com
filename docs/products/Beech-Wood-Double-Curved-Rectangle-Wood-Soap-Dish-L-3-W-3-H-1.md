      <li>And it&#x27;s an attractive design.</li>
      <li>Attractive.  </li>
      <li>Works great as a soap dish and it is attractive too.</li>
      <li>You do have to keep from dripping water all over them, but otherwise great (and that keeps them clean-looking).</li>
      <li>Looks and works great in our shower.</li>
      <li>Great price, great product.</li>
      <li>Happy with purchase.</li>
      <li>Very nice.  </li>
      <li>Also it looks great :) Very happy with my purchase!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Durability seems good, no bleeding, warping, cracking ...</li>
      <li>Holds soap exceptionally well.  </li>
      <li>and they all are beautiful, functional, and easy to maintain.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love this soap dish!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>This is a fairly large cradle for soap....but very attractive and does a nice job of cradling a full-size bar of soap.</li>
      <li>and it looks nice in my kitchen , but</li>
      <li>This is a gorgeous and classy soap dish that works great for keeping the soap from sitting in water.</li>
      <li>Love the wood and the grooves in this soap dish.  </li>
      <li>If you like beechwood soap holders, dare I say there isn&#x27;t a better one anywhere.</li>
      <li>I will be buying more soon.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>These are an elegant addition to our bathroom counters.</li>
      <li>Looks to be made with love.  </li>
      <li>Most soap dishes leave the soap in a pool of water, but this looked like the water could drain off the bar,  </li>
      <li>Most soap dishes are butt-ugly, but this one seemed to have PANACHE.  </li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite items off Amazon.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m ordering 3 more.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised at how much I liked it!</li>
      <li>Very stylish - better for a medium to regular sized bar of soap.  </li>
      <li>I still have to clean up some soap grime, but it reduced it quite a bit.</li>
      <li>It is a tad on the large size and is taller than what I would ideally like, but those are very minor for me.</li>
      <li>soap drys out quickly.</li>
      <li>do I think it was worth $13?</li>
      <li>Fits nicely in the cut out soap box in our shower, and the soap stays dry and not mushy.</li>
      <li>Gorgeous and holds extra large bars (it is quite big).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;We have proofed it against staining from the water with a treatment of walnut oil + beeswax, and it makes our sink look better as well as keeping the bar dry.</li>
      <li>Very well made...sits level on surfaces...</li>
      <li>It is very practical, soap doesn&#x27;t collect on it, it is sturdy and aesthetically pleasing.</li>
      <li>This is a very chunky soap dish...</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it and will likely buy more when we move into a larger home.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>but I was surprised how large it is.  </li>
      <li>This soap dish easily dries out the soap, unlike other soap dishes where they sit in a pool of water.</li>
      <li>The color in real life isn&#x27;t as rich or dark ad</li>
      <li>and it still looks new.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s big enough for me to put a few different soaps on and it has great drainage.</li>
      <li>I wanted something with a natural look that wouldn&#x27;t retain water and make my bar of soap soggy.</li>
      <li>this comes in a light wood which is different than the picture which shows dark.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m writing this because I have finally moved into a new place</li>
      <li>I liked the simplistic wood design</li>

    <li> Gorgeous and holds extra large bars (it is quite big).  I&#x27;ve had it in the shower several months now and it still looks new. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it and will likely buy more when we move into a larger home.  [Edit] I&#x27;ve now had it about a year and it has held up perfectly. It looks the same as the day it came and gets sprayed at least a couple several times a day. I&#x27;m writing this because I have finally moved into a new place and I&#x27;m ordering 3 more.  This is one of my favorite items off Amazon. I hope the quality is still up to snuff. When we camped out in our new house out of suitcases, my bar of soap and this little bugger came with. Sounds silly in hindsight, but it&#x27;s true.</li>

    <li> I bought this as a decorative item to hold the soap. It&#x27;s neat and different from other types. I liked the simplistic wood design</li>
    <li> Purchased six of these for the home and they all are beautiful, functional, and easy to maintain.  Just need to rinse the soap off.</li>
