      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Great smell, performance.</li>
      <li>great price.</li>
      <li>It is also a great value for the price/weight.</li>
      <li>Great pomade</li>
      <li>It holds fairly well for not being as adhesive.  </li>
      <li>I do have a good sense of smell</li>
      <li>It moisturizes good and it makes my hair look and feel good overall, but the best part is it smells awesome.  </li>
      <li>Good product, not pomade though, but more like a wax.</li>
      <li>Light weight, easy on the hair but definitely a good product.</li>
      <li>This hair product is ok,</li>
      <li>I love this gel.</li>
      <li>Product was more liquid than it&#x27;s supposed to be...</li>
      <li>It does also clog pores if it gets on your skin, so make sure to wipe it off if any gets on your face.</li>
      <li>this is the best I have tried several pomades</li>
      <li>Described as providing &amp;#34;flexible control&amp;#34; but this a wax better suited for handlebar mustaches or spiked Mohawks.  </li>
      <li>The price is right, the texture is good, but it REEEEEEKS.</li>
      <li>Even getting this stuff off your hands requires hot water and strong soap! &#x27;</li>
      <li>The title says it all - I have tried all of the major brands and have settled for Redken this is by far the best pomade out there.</li>
      <li>The nice parts about this as others have said is that it gives you a soft hair look without the spikiness of a gel.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been purchasing this product for a couple years now, it works great in my short hair, doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling greasy and keeps a nice wet look all day</li>
      <li>Just clean and pure!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still worth checking out.</li>
      <li>The price point is right on target.</li>
      <li>Hard to find in stores, but is by far the best way to get that \\&quot;no</li>
      <li>Strong male &amp;#34;musk&amp;#34; scent to it, but friendly on the scout.</li>
      <li>but I needed more and needed to hit that $35 for free shipping with other items.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t say that about others and I have used most others until I found this one about a decade back.</li>
      <li>but my other friend said it smells nice</li>
      <li>One of the two containers contains some other kind of haircare product, but its not the Pomade ordered.</li>
      <li>Good stuff, doesn&#x27;t take much to hold and doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff</li>
      <li>It smells too much like chemicals.</li>
      <li>but damn, I don&#x27;t need pomade making that much of a contribution to my scent signature.</li>
      <li>Its too much of a hassle to return one of these,</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t handle the smell of this one though.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just glossy enough to know that he&#x27;s using a product, and it smells clean &amp; ...masculine.</li>
      <li>I have short to medium hair cut; low fade with it longer on top.</li>
      <li>Works great, wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
      <li>Not for normal hair control.  </li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to smells</li>
      <li>Everything about it was the same as if I bought it at the salon but a little better pricing.</li>
      <li>No odd smell!</li>
      <li>I like the hold and shine this product offers.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is the real deal / same thing that is sold at hair salons.</li>
      <li>, im not sure however because the hold is not that strong and after full exposure in the sunlight it dies down the hair however.</li>
      <li>i mean im not sure if it smells good or not cuz one of my friends says it smells like hamburgers</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t keep my hair out of my face. I use this to get my hair out of my face sort of in a combover style, but my hair constantly falls out of place still.</li>
    <li> Product was more liquid than it&#x27;s supposed to be... leaving hair greasy, not styled.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this product for a couple years now, it works great in my short hair, doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling greasy and keeps a nice wet look all day</li>
    <li> This stuff is like axle grease! I can&#x27;t believe people actually use this - &#x27;maybe models or actors to keep hair in place for filming or photography during hurricanes. Even getting this stuff off your hands requires hot water and strong soap! &#x27;Had to give it one star to even submit this review - otherwise I&#x27;d give it zero stars!</li>
    <li> This hair product is ok, i mean im not sure if it smells good or not cuz one of my friends says it smells like hamburgers but my other friend said it smells nice, im not sure however because the hold is not that strong and after full exposure in the sunlight it dies down the hair however.</li>
    <li> The price is right, the texture is good, but it REEEEEEKS. Smells like a parfumerie exploded. I do have a good sense of smell but damn, I don&#x27;t need pomade making that much of a contribution to my scent signature. Disgusting odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone know a pomade which doesn&#x27;t reek? The following pomades reek badly to me: American Crew, Axe, Got2B, etc.</li>
    <li> Light weight, easy on the hair but definitely a good product. Strong male &amp;#34;musk&amp;#34; scent to it, but friendly on the scout. Dries quickly so avoid using on dry hair, slightly damp, just a little will do. Too wet will cause soapy reaction.</li>
    <li> great price. good product!</li>
    <li> I love this gel. Hard to find in stores, but is by far the best way to get that \\&quot;no gel\\&quot; look. Never makes my hair crunchy, and only takes a small amount to hold for my 12+ hour days at the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the real deal / same thing that is sold at hair salons. The price point is right on target.</li>
    <li> Works great, wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> This pomade keeps my husband&#x27;s hair under control (it&#x27;s easy hair, normal short medium brown - neither heavily textured nor thin). It&#x27;s just glossy enough to know that he&#x27;s using a product, and it smells clean &amp; ...masculine.</li>
    <li> No odd smell! Just clean and pure!</li>
    <li> gives body, shine, and keeps hair in place.  Need only a small amount</li>
    <li> Described as providing &amp;#34;flexible control&amp;#34; but this a wax better suited for handlebar mustaches or spiked Mohawks.  Not for normal hair control.  Seller does not accept returns, even on unused products, yet &amp;#34;no returns&amp;#34; is not disclosed on seller&#x27;s profile return policy.&lt;br /&gt;Bad product &amp; bad service.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Husband wont use anything else. Works great</li>
    <li> I like the hold and shine this product offers. It is also a great value for the price/weight. I really can&#x27;t handle the smell of this one though. It smells too much like chemicals. I am very sensitive to smells so maybe it&#x27;s just me. If you are like me though, you probably won&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Redken 03 Water Wax doesn&#x27;t have the smell, but it&#x27;s not has shiny as this one. It&#x27;s still worth checking out.</li>
    <li> One of the two containers contains some other kind of haircare product, but its not the Pomade ordered. Its too much of a hassle to return one of these, but I find somewhere else to buy this in the future.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, doesn&#x27;t take much to hold and doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff</li>
    <li> I have short to medium hair cut; low fade with it longer on top. This gel paste is like crack for me. Ever since my hair tested it out, it has been a staple. If you want that NON-crusting gel and if needed, later in the day you can re-wet your hair and it still functions! Best gel ever.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for me. I usually just buy the stuff at a salon but I needed more and needed to hit that $35 for free shipping with other items. Everything about it was the same as if I bought it at the salon but a little better pricing.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this and used it for the 3rd time.  The nice parts about this as others have said is that it gives you a soft hair look without the spikiness of a gel.  It holds fairly well for not being as adhesive.  I have dark black hair, and have not seen any flakes showing in my hair.    Why I rate this a 2 stars:      The ultimate downside of this product is that it may not make your hair look greasy, but it does make it *feel* greasy.  I tried using a very minimal amount, but no matter what you do, it will always have that soap grimy feel to it whenever you put your fingers in it.  For me, that is a deal breaker, because it is one of the biggest turnoffs for women and they&#x27;ll never want to run their fingers through your hair again.  It does also clog pores if it gets on your skin, so make sure to wipe it off if any gets on your face.</li>
    <li> Great pomade it&#x27;s not greasy and comes out with a regular shower. It holds your hair the way u want it  all day long. You can&#x27;t say that about others and I have used most others until I found this one about a decade back. Great product.</li>
    <li> Great smell, performance. It moisturizes good and it makes my hair look and feel good overall, but the best part is it smells awesome.  However, it is expensive so it loses a star.</li>
    <li> My husband said &amp;#34;ehhhh&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product performance, and the price was good too.</li>
    <li> this is the best I have tried several pomades</li>
    <li> Good product, not pomade though, but more like a wax.</li>
    <li> The title says it all - I have tried all of the major brands and have settled for Redken this is by far the best pomade out there.</li>
