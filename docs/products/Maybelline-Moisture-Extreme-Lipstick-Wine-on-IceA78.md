    <li> Love this shade of lipstick.  Too bad Maybelline has discontinued it and it is hard to find.  Fortunately I found it at Amazon.</li>
    <li> There was a mix up in the order. OK, it happens. Received the proper item quickly and easily. Even had a little bonus in it. And return of the wrong item was easy. You can&#x27;t really judge customer service until something goes wrong. These people do the right thing. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty shade of rose.  I have olive skin tone and many lipstick shades don&#x27;t work on me.  I finally found Maybelline&#x27;s &#x27;wine on ice&#x27; and it looked great with my complexion.    However, when I went to buy it again the product had been discontinued.  I was excited to find it on Amazon and bought three tubes.  The lipstick is moist, a little shimmery, and is a color that almost anyone can wear.</li>
    <li> I love the lipstick and cannot find it in the stores. Only problem was there was only one sent or available but it still cost the same as two.</li>
    <li> I had ordered this same lipstick product a short while back.  I was very pleased with the product and decided to order two (2) more tubes to have on hand.  This is a discontinued product on the retail market and I am pleased to have located it and found it to be fresh and perfect.  Thank you for carrying these items.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this lipstick for 40 years. It&#x27;s now being discontinued 😓. The only problem I had was the price that was charged for it!</li>
    <li> This color is beautiful.  I get so many compliments and questions about brand &amp; color.  I can&#x27;t understand why Maybelline withdrew it from the stores.  I know it&#x27;s been around for years, but the color and moisturizing quality is the best!</li>
    <li> I am a self proclaimed &amp;#34;beauty addict&amp;#34; and this is my ONLY go-to lip color. I bought it about 4 years ago and I have yet to find another color that even comes close to being this amazing. It&#x27;s pinkish, with red and blue undertones. Also, because it has the cool undertones, it helps make your teeth appear whiter and brighter. And it looks good on everyone! It might sound weird, but if I&#x27;m in a hurry or need some color on my cheeks, I will use a little of this and blend. I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments on how great I look when I do this. I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s this lip color! I think Maybelline has discontinued it (HUGE MISTAKE!), as I cannot find it in stores, but I am fine buying from Amazon. I&#x27;ve actually bought a few at a time, as I am afriad they&#x27;ll eventually not have any left for me to purchase. Love, love, love!</li>
    <li> Wine on Ice.  I have been using this lipstick for MANY years and they discontinued it.  I was sick-at-heart.  Three years ago I found it on-line for $2.00 each and this year I had to pay $9.00 each.  I bought three of them as I love this particular lipstick.  I think I have been ripped off.  What do you folks think?</li>
    <li> This lipstick is the only color I wore for years.  Hated it when Maybelline discontinued the color!!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t duplicate the color with any other lipstick.  Bring this color back!</li>
    <li> It made me feel younger because this color is me. In comparison to other products  the color and texture are superp</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a red head and do not have the best coloring for pink.  This is one of the few I can wear.  My blue eyes go from greyish to navy with this lipstick!!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> We were happy to find this discontinued item which enables us to rate this a five star*****&lt;br /&gt;Have not opened as yet but feel sure it is the same product that was requested.</li>
    <li> My absolute all time favorite lipstick shade. Unfortunately it has been discontinued. This item was just as promised.</li>
    <li> we like it but we think its over priced</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this lipstick every where and for a long time.  It is really pretty and not in any stores.</li>
    <li> I have worn this color for years.  The only problem I have is I can no longer find it in the stores.  Actually had to google it to find out if it was disontinued or not.  Other than the inconvenience, I am satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This is my mothers color. They don&#x27;t sell it in stores anymore, so I got this for her and she was so excited! It came fast and as described</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 tubes.  One was OK.  The other was about half gone and appeared to have been used. My mistake was in not recognizing that these were discontinued cosmetics and therefore,old.</li>
    <li> I could no longer find this color in the stores.  It&#x27;s my favorite and I&#x27;ve used it for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I just can&#x27;t stand it when a company stops supplying what is a most decent product... and I do mean decent...  the bright reds aren&#x27;t for most of us...  At  my wits end, I decided to try the web..  and what a wonderful surprise to find my lipsticks still available...for now.  I bought enough, hopefully, to outlast my lips.  The other pinks were awful...color etc... thank you Amazon for doing what you do...</li>
    <li> Love the color of this lipstick.  Thankful that I can still purchase it.</li>
    <li> My favorite lipstick and not available in stores. would buy if they would reissue it. NEw products not as creamy</li>
