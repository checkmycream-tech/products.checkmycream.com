<li> I finally used Dawn dish soap, which fixed the problem.  </li>
<li> No real complaints on this conditioner other than it&#x27;s a minty fragrance, which is completely different from the accompanying ColorProof  SuperRich shampoo that I use before this.</li>
<li> so this is an expensive choice for me, but it is worth it.</li>
<li> Not much conditioner lost.  </li>
<li> I use it with the pink ColorProof Anti-Frizz shampoo.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> I previously used Pureology and began to notice it just wasn&#x27;t moisturizing my hair as it had done.</li>
<li> This product, for colored hair, is not easily found in stores.  </li>
<li> but this was much less expensive in the larger container.</li>
<li> DON’T waste your money on products that are not certified ColorProof!</li>
<li> Like the shampoo this product is concentrated so that a small amount is all I need to use which offsets the price.  </li>
<li> and it was mixed with something left my hair sooooo dry and the smell was horrible</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very surprised that this seller sold me a fake product and very disappointed i spent $$  </li>
<li> It was so bad that my hair looked wet!  </li>
<li> ColorProof has an anti-diversion program that they take very seriously to uphold the integrity of their products.</li>
<li> Totally addicted to this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
<li> THIS IS ILLEGAL to sell ColorProof over the internet.</li>
<li> Very frustrating, embarrassing and wasteful.</li>
<li> This is dangerous to purchasers not knowing what they are truly getting and putting on their hair &amp; scalp.</li>

    <li> not the same product!</li>
    <li> I love love love this conditioner. Works great and smells yummy. I use it with the pink ColorProof Anti-Frizz shampoo. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Package arrived on time and in excellent working order.  I thought I could only find this product in salons but it was on amazon.  I feel like I have gone to the salon every time I use it.  Feels great when I apply it to my hair.  The minty smell is very refreshing.  My hair is virtually tangle free after rinsing and my hair smells and feels amazing for several days after use.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been a faithful Pureology user for years! My hairdresser told me to try this and let me tell you...What a Fantastic product. This makes Pureology seem like a cheap store brand. LOVE LOVE LOVE it! I also bought the shampoo and treatment hair oil.</li>
    <li> Trust me, I have botten all kinds of shampoos and conditioners, this is by far one of the bet out there.  I will be buying more</li>
    <li> I had my reservations about this conditioner being the real deal because I have purchased it for a year for 60$ from my salon. When I found it on Amazon I was skepticle about the price. I called Amazon and asked if I received a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; or something of low quality- could I return it. Amazon assured me that I could. It arrived quickly. I opened it up, smelled it, compared it with the one I had been using from the salon. I washed my hair with it, paying attention to the texture and how it conditioned. It is the real thing. I am happy with my purchase and will buy it again. I will review it again if the quality is ever off in the future!</li>
    <li> Product delivered is real, and my hair loves it!</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used in a really long time. I previously used Pureology and began to notice it just wasn&#x27;t moisturizing my hair as it had done. I love this shampoo and conditioner. I have changed to ColorProof for all my hair care.</li>
    <li> The box arrived smelling minty.  The conditioner had opened during shipment.  Not much conditioner lost.  Feels cool and comforting upon application.  Love the invigorating minty smell.  A little goes a long way.  The pumper bottle is a godsend.  Perfect for those of us who don&#x27;t like complicated regimens.</li>
    <li> This product, for colored hair, is not easily found in stores.  The designer of this conditioner designed Purology which has been sold to a large distributor.  My hairdresser recommended this product over Purology.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.I have hunted and hunted for a brand that left my color treated hair feeling and looking great..and this is it! I LOVE LOVE this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colorproof is amazing!</li>
    <li> love this conditioner!  Best and tingles!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel like I just got it done at the salon! Totally addicted to this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after buying the shampoo and liking it.  My hair is very fine and this conditioner does a nice job of giving it some life without weighing it down.  My hair is smoother and more shiny which is also nice.  Like the shampoo this product is concentrated so that a small amount is all I need to use which offsets the price.  Hope this brand stays around and the product itself is not diluted or cheapened over time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 2/3 of this shampoo / conditioner and the last 2 times I used it, I had large oily / waxy sections of hair (from scalp to ends).  It was so bad that my hair looked wet!  After multiple washes with a different shampoo / conditioner... It was still there!. I finally used Dawn dish soap, which fixed the problem.  I guess I reached a spot in the bottle that wasn&#x27;t mixed correctly.  Very frustrating, embarrassing and wasteful.</li>
    <li> This is the only conditioner that truly makes my hair soft, smooth, and still maintain volume. I generally am very thrifty so this is an expensive choice for me, but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Nice breeze, very good conditioner, rich but not sticky.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Great price! Thanks(:</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very surprised that this seller sold me a fake product and very disappointed i spent $$  i ordered the shampoo from another seller and it was great but the conditioner from here and it was mixed with something left my hair sooooo dry and the smell was horrible i only used it 3 times and i just can tell because i had it this product before and this was my second bottle DO NOT BUY FROM HERE please save your money .</li>
    <li> Naturally curly and color treated hair needs all the love it can get. I love this product!</li>
    <li> this is the best product i have ever used, and i have tried many different products.I have my hair colored every 4 to 5 weeks, and my hair is fine. This conditioner gives my hair the right amount moisture without weighing my hair down.</li>
    <li> THIS IS ILLEGAL to sell ColorProof over the internet. SHAME ON Amazon for allowing this to happen!!! Only licensed hairstylists are allowed to sell these from their salons. I know for a FACT that these products that are purchased over the internet are NOT THE REAL THING….they are either a diluted version or cheap shampoo poured into the bottle. ColorProof has an anti-diversion program that they take very seriously to uphold the integrity of their products. This is dangerous to purchasers not knowing what they are truly getting and putting on their hair &amp; scalp. DON’T waste your money on products that are not certified ColorProof! Buy THE REAL fantastic Colorproof from your local salon. These products can only be guaranteed through a salon that has an authorized account through ColorProof. EVERYONE should alert AMAZON this seller and others like. You are hurting the businesses that go through the appropriate channels to obtain and sell these products. To all those who love these products, support your local salons and stylists by purchasing them. They have the REAL product and it worth EVERY every penny!! BEWARE DON’T PURCHASE FROM: BEAUTY IT IS</li>
    <li> love it&lt;br /&gt;it smells clean&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t need to use a lot</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem like the real product or was old.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff.  Much cheaper here than from hair salon.</li>
    <li> Love love love ! My hair was getting dry and it&#x27;s a great moisturizing shampoo and conditioner . highly recomend .</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.  I like this conditioner very much.  It&#x27;s sold at my salon but this was much less expensive in the larger container.</li>
    <li> No real complaints on this conditioner other than it&#x27;s a minty fragrance, which is completely different from the accompanying ColorProof  SuperRich shampoo that I use before this. I wish the fragrances were the same.</li>
