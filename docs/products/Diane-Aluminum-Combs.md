      <li>The teeth could be longer for a better product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using these aluminum combs for years because they don&#x27;t cause a problem with static.</li>
      <li>Traveling is a challenge because items get lost and do you risk you favorite comb?  </li>
      <li>Love the aluminum comb.</li>
      <li>I read in Glamour magazine that if you have &amp;#34;winter fly-away static hair&amp;#34; that using a metal comb help cuz plastic holds the static.  </li>
      <li>I plan on ordering more because the comb glides thru the the hair with ease even with tangled  and curly hair.</li>
      <li>It was of better quality and certainly more aluminum.</li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>Light more like plastic.</li>
      <li>Especially, I think it is more beautiful than my iron one.</li>
      <li>Easy to keep clean and ideal for short hair like mine</li>
      <li>So, probably if you just wanted to keep it in your bathroom it would be fine...</li>
      <li>This is a perfectly fine comb.  </li>
      <li>Had to use sandpaper so smooth the edges of the teeth</li>
      <li>Also, it does not slip smoothly through the hair--tends to snarl for some reason, even on a man&#x27;s shorter hair.</li>
      <li>Cheap.</li>
      <li>Cheap and durable.</li>
      <li>I never would have imagined they would be so cheaply made.</li>
      <li>I like hearing the sound the comb makes while I comb my hair.  </li>
      <li>I was just excited to find a metal comb</li>
      <li>The only good thing I can say about this comb is</li>
      <li>Would recommend this awesome styling comb.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for thick hair.  </li>
      <li>It bent easily on the first use.  </li>
      <li>Super bendy.</li>
      <li>The teeth in plastic and vinyl combs break and fall out fairly quickly.  </li>
      <li>My hair is not thick (hence the winter fly-away static problem) and this comb was 100% failure.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Worth about 5 cents</li>
      <li>Pretty cool to use an aluminum comb.  </li>
      <li>This is pretty flimsy and arrived bent (I was able to easily bend it back).</li>
      <li>It bends easily and is not shaped like a normal comb.</li>
      <li>right SIX of these Diane 7\\&quot; Aluminum Barber Comb # 8265.</li>
      <li>Strong and durable has lasted through a lot and still looks brand new.</li>
      <li>The reason I did not give it a 5 was when I opened the box it looked liked the comb was not there while the other item was.</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s pretty), very shiny like the shiny side of aluminum foil.  </li>
      <li>I have had aluminum combs in the past and thought these combs would be equally as good.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend this product to anyone with anything but short, easy to comb though hair.</li>
      <li>They get bent out of shape, but bend back into shape just as easily</li>
      <li>I like the comb because the teeth seem to be very durable.  </li>
      <li>so much you really saved the day!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I then again looked in the box and decided to lift one bottom fold, and there it was tucked under the bottom fold and ready to fall out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was not sturdy enough and did not go through hair smoothly.</li>
      <li>The Diane 7\\&quot; aluminum barber comb is okay - not super, not poor.</li>
      <li>It performs as it should, just not as sturdy as the older combs.</li>
      <li>If I hadn&#x27;t paid shipping I would send them back,  but the cost of shipping them back plus the cost of having them shipped to me would be more than the cost of the combs.</li>
      <li>It bends quite easily, in carrying it in my pocket, it bends when I set down.</li>
      <li>I subsequently found complaints from others online that matched mine exactly.  </li>
      <li>I use this comb equally with a regular plastic/vinyl type comb--they both have unique qualities in this ageless part of grooming.</li>
      <li>Let me say this comb is nothing like my Dad&#x27;s old comb.  </li>
      <li>so my husband could replace an old one he lost.  </li>
      <li>the old one I had had for years</li>
      <li>the ends are NOT &#x27;sharp&#x27;.</li>
      <li>The Diane comb is a cheap alternative and for the money, it is certainly serviceable, but it is not nearly as smooth as my previous one.</li>
      <li>that was listed on my old  comb, the new one has the same number and name but that is the only thing that is similar.</li>
      <li>It bent almost in half the first time I ran it through my hair.  </li>
      <li>It should last him 60 years like his very first chrome comb that finally had missing teeth!  </li>

<li> It should last him 60 years like his very first chrome comb that finally had missing teeth!  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s the same size, but only 1/6 the mass; not sturdy at all (bends very easy, was bent upon receipt); not very well finished (the teeth are not smooth nor tapered and will snag hair as you comb), not for seriously long or thick hair.  </li>
<li> It will do, but I find it a bit smaller than I expected--the teeth are not quite long enough.</li>
<li> /&gt;Amazon, when you send out a small item like that you have to do much better.&lt;br</li>
<li> The comb was of such cheap material that it bent if you blew on it, and as it was just stamped out, and unfinished, the edges and points were sharp enough to cut your scalp when you used it; totally useless!  </li>
<li> But only if you want to push the teeth down to the scalp-</li>
<li> Also, I want the flat edge tooth end, as opposed to the pointy ends on plastic combs, because these teeth can get down to the scalp and give it a &#x27;massage&#x27;, IF you want to.  </li>
<li> it bends in the middle  as I am using it, Very disappointed as I have had the same comb for several years, which was a heavier, more sturdy made comb.</li>
<li> I bought this comb to replace one I inherited from my father upon his passing; I was in the military, moved around a lot and his comb got lost.  </li>
<li> It wasn&#x27;t as sturdy as I expected.</li>
<li> The aluminum comb is not as rigid as expected.</li>
<li> The edges of the teeth were sharp and scraped the sides off of the hair.</li>
<li> sharp edges so</li>
<li> So I was delighted to find one on your site;  unfortunately, when it arrived I was disappointed to find it only resembeled my \\&quot;old\\&quot; metal comb in appearance!!  </li>
<li> He likes to carry it in his pocket and unfortunately this aluminum one bends and will not stay straight.  </li>
<li> They are not worth buying at any price.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not very strong.  </li>
<li> My previous aluminum comb lasted me for thirty-five years.</li>
<li> Not worth the trouble to return.</li>
<li> These combs are thin and will bend if one is not careful.</li>
<li> was a waste of money</li>
<li> I actually read a (negative) review of this product that stated the same things I&#x27;m saying here, but I couldn&#x27;t believe it could be that bad. . .</li>
<li> /&gt;DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
<li> Indeed the product was so inferior that I would find it unlikely that I would trust the distributor enough to order any thing else from them.</li>
<li> Also, tips of teeth are rectangular and not tapered making it hard to insert into hair.</li>
<li> this is no good</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I like this comb because i can use it with my hair straightener. It does not melt like the plastic comb.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t lift the hair well while tapering.</li>
    <li> I remembered having a metal comb several years ago... So I was delighted to find one on your site;  unfortunately, when it arrived I was disappointed to find it only resembeled my \\&quot;old\\&quot; metal comb in appearance!!  It bends quite easily, in carrying it in my pocket, it bends when I set down. So, probably if you just wanted to keep it in your bathroom it would be fine...</li>
    <li> It bends easily and is not shaped like a normal comb. It was not sturdy enough and did not go through hair smoothly.</li>
    <li> The Diane 7\\&quot; aluminum barber comb is okay - not super, not poor. I&#x27;ve had a foreign-made aluminum barber comb for almost 50 years and it finally lost one of its teeth. The Diane comb is a cheap alternative and for the money, it is certainly serviceable, but it is not nearly as smooth as my previous one.</li>
    <li> it bends in the middle  as I am using it, Very disappointed as I have had the same comb for several years, which was a heavier, more sturdy made comb. I ordered the same number and brand  that was listed on my old  comb, the new one has the same number and name but that is the only thing that is similar.</li>
    <li> The reason I did not give it a 5 was when I opened the box it looked liked the comb was not there while the other item was. I decided to e mail Amazon and could not find a link to do that, frustrating. I then again looked in the box and decided to lift one bottom fold, and there it was tucked under the bottom fold and ready to fall out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon, when you send out a small item like that you have to do much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the communication it speaks for it self.</li>
    <li> I have had aluminum combs in the past and thought these combs would be equally as good. I never would have imagined they would be so cheaply made. I can&#x27;t even run one through my hair without it bending! If I hadn&#x27;t paid shipping I would send them back,  but the cost of shipping them back plus the cost of having them shipped to me would be more than the cost of the combs.</li>
    <li> This is a perfectly fine comb.  I was searching for a metal one so my husband could replace an old one he lost.  He likes to carry it in his pocket and unfortunately this aluminum one bends and will not stay straight.  I should have been looking for a steel comb.  So it is not the product I was looking for but I did not know that until I tried this one.  It is not the comb&#x27;s fault.</li>
    <li> Pretty cool to use an aluminum comb.  Have no idea if it is good for your hair or scalp.  I like hearing the sound the comb makes while I comb my hair.  Has a nice ring to it.</li>
    <li> Nice comb, but it&#x27;s not very strong.  If I get a tangle in my hair and push it, the comb will bend.</li>
    <li> I was greatly disappointed in the quality of the workmanship.  My previous aluminum comb lasted me for thirty-five years. It was of better quality and certainly more aluminum. These combs are thin and will bend if one is not careful. Typical of some products: cutting corners in the quality of the product to maximize profits. Sad state of affairs.</li>
    <li> Not worth the trouble to return. Cheap. Light more like plastic. If I could have held it in my hand, I would never have purchased it.</li>
    <li> I read in Glamour magazine that if you have &amp;#34;winter fly-away static hair&amp;#34; that using a metal comb help cuz plastic holds the static.  I was just excited to find a metal comb - I didnt bother to read the reviews, wish I had!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE WEAKEST COMB EVER!  It bent almost in half the first time I ran it through my hair.  My hair is not thick (hence the winter fly-away static problem) and this comb was 100% failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> Cheap and durable. i keep breaking plastic combs, (i have thick-long hair) for a guy its just annoying. So i got 6- thats right SIX of these Diane 7\\&quot; Aluminum Barber Comb # 8265. they should last me a while. I am putting them everywhere.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Look like the picture.</li>
    <li> This comb was the only one my wife could find, but the comb&#x27;s aluminum &#x27;fingers&#x27; are too short. The manufacturer should make them in differnent sizes. It is called a barber comb, but my wife wanted it to do femaile hair. She used to be a hairdresser and had used them in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed in the product.</li>
    <li> Super bendy. Worth about 5 cents</li>
    <li> Was disappointed in this comb.  The edges of the teeth were sharp and scraped the sides off of the hair. Had to use sandpaper so smooth the edges of the teeth so they would slide through hair.  Also, tips of teeth are rectangular and not tapered making it hard to insert into hair.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000YGMHNS Diane 7\\&quot; Aluminum Barber Comb # 8265]]&lt;br /&gt;As for bending, who puts a 7 inch comb in their back pocket? Also, I want the flat edge tooth end, as opposed to the pointy ends on plastic combs, because these teeth can get down to the scalp and give it a &#x27;massage&#x27;, IF you want to.  But only if you want to push the teeth down to the scalp- the ends are NOT &#x27;sharp&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Shipping was on time.  I like the comb because the teeth seem to be very durable.  The teeth in plastic and vinyl combs break and fall out fairly quickly.  That doesn&#x27;t happen with this comb.  I will order from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> It will do, but I find it a bit smaller than I expected--the teeth are not quite long enough. Also, it does not slip smoothly through the hair--tends to snarl for some reason, even on a man&#x27;s shorter hair.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a substantial sturdy comb. This is pretty flimsy and arrived bent (I was able to easily bend it back). Aside from that it functions as a comb</li>
    <li> I chose this comb based on the fact it was made of aluminum.  Lightweight and sturdy is what came to mind; it ended being about as flimsy as a soda can.  I would not recommend this product to anyone with anything but short, easy to comb though hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these aluminum combs for years because they don&#x27;t cause a problem with static. They get bent out of shape, but bend back into shape just as easily and they never break. I just lose them, so I buy several when I order them.</li>
    <li> been looking for one for years...it wont break or wear out. Easy to keep clean and ideal for short hair like mine</li>
    <li> Years ago I was given an aluminum barber comb and loved it.  Traveling is a challenge because items get lost and do you risk you favorite comb?  I decided to look for a second comb so I did not need to worry.  This comb is lighter weight than the one I have had for years and was concerned but it has held up well.  After being tossed carelessly into my bad for dozens of planes and trains, it has a slight bend but is still doing well.  For the price, it is a great comb.</li>
    <li> This comb is okay.  The teeth could be longer for a better product.  Nice metal finish.  Metal combs can be bent though.</li>
    <li> This comb bends everytime you use it was a waste of money and I purchased 3 I hate it the old one I had had for years this is no good</li>
    <li> The aluminum comb is not as rigid as expected. It performs as it should, just not as sturdy as the older combs.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and fight static in the winter months. This comb is perfect! Static is not a problem!!</li>
    <li> I use this comb equally with a regular plastic/vinyl type comb--they both have unique qualities in this ageless part of grooming.</li>
    <li> Works great, even as a pocket comb.&lt;br /&gt;No sharp edges so for my hair it works great.&lt;br /&gt;Metal is metal :) can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> This is a nice order. Especially, I think it is more beautiful than my iron one. If you want to choose a good thing for your hair, this&#x27;s your</li>
    <li> I was looking for this comb for my husband, he had one for years and do to some very unfortunate circumstances this past year on vacation it was lost.  He was so unhappy. I searched and searched and I found the one you your site.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon so much you really saved the day!!&lt;br /&gt;My husband is happy again.</li>
    <li> I am a hairdresser for 45 years and thats the only type of comb I use.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for teasing hair!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was tired of plastic combs that were always breaking on me.  Doing a search of Amazon for something tougher, I came across these aluminum combs.  Just the answer!  Love them.</li>
    <li> I plan on ordering more because the comb glides thru the the hair with ease even with tangled  and curly hair.</li>
    <li> Strong and durable has lasted through a lot and still looks brand new.</li>
    <li> this comb is just too flimsy.</li>
    <li> Diane Aluminum Barber Comb  - I was a little disappointed with this product.  It wasn&#x27;t as sturdy as I expected.</li>
    <li> The comb was of such cheap material that it bent if you blew on it, and as it was just stamped out, and unfinished, the edges and points were sharp enough to cut your scalp when you used it; totally useless!  I subsequently found complaints from others online that matched mine exactly.  Indeed the product was so inferior that I would find it unlikely that I would trust the distributor enough to order any thing else from them.</li>
    <li> I bought this comb to replace one I inherited from my father upon his passing; I was in the military, moved around a lot and his comb got lost.  Let me say this comb is nothing like my Dad&#x27;s old comb.  It&#x27;s the same size, but only 1/6 the mass; not sturdy at all (bends very easy, was bent upon receipt); not very well finished (the teeth are not smooth nor tapered and will snag hair as you comb), not for seriously long or thick hair.  The only good thing I can say about this comb is (it&#x27;s pretty), very shiny like the shiny side of aluminum foil.  I actually read a (negative) review of this product that stated the same things I&#x27;m saying here, but I couldn&#x27;t believe it could be that bad. . . it was.  I would NOT recommend this product to anyone; well, maybe a girl I was mad at and wanted to see her ruin her hair.</li>
    <li> Good comb; however, because the teeth are square rather than rounded, it seems as though one is raking the hair rather than combing it.  It should last him 60 years like his very first chrome comb that finally had missing teeth!  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been hunting for a comb like this. Being made of metal it should last longer than plastic which keeps breaking</li>
    <li> Identical in appearance to an aluminum comb I bought at Hoffritz years ago.  This one however is not like the one from Hoffritz at all.  It bent easily on the first use.  The price seemed good so I bought four.  They are not worth buying at any price.</li>
    <li> Would recommend this awesome styling comb.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for thick hair.  Won&#x27;t break of bend.&lt;br /&gt;Gives a great style with a strong product construction.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product when trying to find a good comb.</li>
    <li> Love the aluminum comb.</li>
