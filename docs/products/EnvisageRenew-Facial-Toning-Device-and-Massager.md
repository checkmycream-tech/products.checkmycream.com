      <li>- i.e. keep it in your desk at work, have it handy in the kitchen when you&#x27;re reading the paper before going to work.&lt;br /&gt;Really, give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;J. McCreary, Toronto</li>

      <li>and I am seeing the benefits,  so great customer service and truly a great product, highly highly recommend,  Mary H.</li>

      <li>Contacted the seller and they sent me a new one that has worked perfectly ever since.</li>
      <li>And the best part of the improvement is how natural it looks.</li>
      <li>Customer service was quick and excellent when I reported the first device not working...</li>
      <li>I am so glad I found this product, as it is so easy and fun to use, and the best, gets visable results quick.</li>
      <li>I was not paid to review and made a point to take the time to because of how pleased I am with results.</li>
      <li>It may be my imagination, but I seemed to have more pronounced wrinkles after using it for awhile than I did when I started.</li>
      <li>This is the best designed facial product around.  </li>
      <li>This thing can&#x27;t cost more than two dollars to manufacture so</li>
      <li>I love people telling me I look 35</li>
      <li>I have noticed my face and neck have more definition and eyes</li>
      <li>I love this device.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this device.  </li>
      <li>This device is so much better than anything else I have tried before.</li>
      <li>I plan to buy two more to give as gifts to my sisters because I can&#x27;t think of anything that they would appreciate more.  </li>
      <li>I will continue using and recommending for many years.</li>
      <li>Even my jaw line is more taught.</li>
      <li>and I feel so much better.  </li>
      <li>have noticed my wrinkles have disappeared and its a great way to get rid of wrinkles in a natural way!!</li>
      <li>Have been using it for 2 months now and can say that my smile lines for sure look much better!</li>
      <li>I loved this product so much that I decided to buy one for my friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Rarely do I write reviews on products, but this product is deserving of my time.  </li>
      <li>I still combine the use of this with facialflex since the latter is quick and easy and I am very happy with the results.</li>
      <li>The chin has shaped up and is more sculptured, the jowls have tightened up and the neck area has improved significantly.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend this product to anyone who wants to look more youthful without any harmful risks!</li>
      <li>This unique and extremely effective product comes highly and confidently endorsed by this user.</li>
      <li>This is a great device and it works, especially on the vibration.</li>
      <li>I bought the Envisage because of the great reviews on here initially.  </li>
      <li>In a short time I received a replacement that has been working great</li>
      <li>and it isn&#x27;t a sleepy, saggy face that greets me, but one that looks fresh and more youthful.  </li>
      <li>This product is very effective, easy and quick to add into any daily routine.</li>
      <li>You have to do it consistently and for more than a couple of weeks to see results.  </li>
      <li>My face feels refreshed, stimulated, exercised and loved with this simple devise.</li>
      <li>thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to give it a true test</li>
      <li>I saw this device and sincerely I was expecting to work… but this really works, It makes you face firmer and glow.</li>
      <li>My face is very toned, and my neck, which is much more flaccid than my face is beginning to show changes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product isn&#x27;t a magic cure for aging, but it certainly brings more grace to the process and is allowing me to develop the facial muscle tone that promotes a more youthful appearance.  </li>
      <li>Great little gadget.</li>
      <li>Now for about 6 weeks I&#x27;ve been already using another weight training system that gave me great results, but there was still a little bit of tightening that was needed under my chin, jowl and outer jaw area.  </li>
      <li>I have been doing it since April and the changes are nothing short of amazing.  </li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s non-invasive - an excellent alternative for someone who wants to look younger without harsh chemicals, surgery, needles, etc.</li>
      <li>I have come up with some additional exercises for eyes and smile lines (borrowed from Reinhart but with the use of Envisage).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased so far, and thank you for the product.</li>
      <li>It has improved my overall appearance including eyes and forehead but most noticeably, it has smoothed out my smile lines and folds and significantly tightened the skin under my chin.</li>
      <li>I notice it most when I first get up in the morning and am surprised when I look in the bathroom mirror</li>
      <li>Recently when I went for a facial the aesthetician congratulated me on my great skin tone.</li>
      <li>most amazing is that my face was balanced: some years ago my smile began to not be even as one side of my face is not smiling and had an eyebrow lower than other (!).</li>
      <li>The first Envisage I received had a manufacturing defect, i calked the company</li>
      <li>I was totally awed at the outstanding service I received,</li>
      <li>thanks Anita!</li>
      <li>The lines are almost gone, the bags are starting to disappear, my skin is tighter and seems more uniform.</li>
      <li>Like any exercise program, you must dedicate yourself to doing this consistently.</li>
      <li>This indeed does happen when used consistently.  </li>
      <li>Friends who know me remark that I look refreshed, but don&#x27;t know exactly how I achieved these results since they know I don&#x27;t use injectables or believe in surgical procedures.  </li>
      <li>Thank you EnvisageRenew for a product that really works and is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>are more open.  </li>
      <li>I cant do this on consistent basis.</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the electricity in the head; it works good when I just do a very few reps of the exercises</li>
      <li>I had smart lipo of the neck done and used this product as well.  </li>
      <li>Really if you are concern about sagging or loosing definition in your face….</li>
      <li>this product really does lift the face.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Poor quality, not what I was looking for.  Very powerless.  Does not seem or feel like it is doing anything to my skin or muscles.&lt;br /&gt;Edited to ADD:  The company was apologetic about my damaged item, and refunded my money immediately.  Very professional, thanks.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I have seen dramatic results in 6 weeks on my jaw line and lines around my mouth. I am getting compliments from everyone around me. Utilizing this product I have received results far superior to the injections I had done in past.  Now they will be a thing of the past.  I am recommending to all my friends!  A tiny investment compared to other means.....and it works!</li>
    <li> The instructions do not state how often I should use it after the 6 week trial. Do I continue everyday forever or do I cut it down to 3-4 times a week</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product  fast results, and excellent customer service... Considering another one for my mother.</li>
    <li> I found I have to be very careful not to use it too much, or too intensely. When I do, I get severe neck pain, throws off my cranium. Maybe it&#x27;s the electricity in the head; it works good when I just do a very few reps of the exercises</li>
    <li> I previously reviewed this product under my name but since I purchased it with our Prime account which is under my husband&#x27;s name I wanted to do another review under his name.  I bought the Envisage because of the great reviews on here initially.  It&#x27;s turned out to be one of the best, if not the best, purchase I have ever made on here.  It&#x27;s honestly that good.  You have to do it consistently and for more than a couple of weeks to see results.  I have been doing it since April and the changes are nothing short of amazing.  I am actually thinking of purchasing another one for safekeeping in case it&#x27;s ever discontinued!</li>
    <li> I had smart lipo of the neck done and used this product as well.  The combination has produced awesome results in two weeks.  Great customer service too.  Update 03/16/2015:  It&#x27;s still a good product with good customer service but my results have faded some since my initial review.</li>
    <li> It may work.... It takes alot of time and effort to do it.  I cant do this on consistent basis. So i rly dont see the result.</li>
    <li> This is the best designed facial product around.  I have tried two other competitors, and hands down this is the best!  And how can you beat the price?  I started using the Facial Toning Device about a year ago and recently lost/left it at a hotel while on a trip.  Thank heavens I&#x27;ve found it again and can restart my routine.  My cheekbones are lifted, and the lines on my forehead have virtually disappeared (I also have always looked after my skin).  I&#x27;m working on my chin at the moment as I seem to carry so much tension there that even it has wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;This is an uncomplicated device to use - for both MEN and women.  It&#x27;s such a classy design you can use it outside of the privacy of your own room - i.e. keep it in your desk at work, have it handy in the kitchen when you&#x27;re reading the paper before going to work.&lt;br /&gt;Really, give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;J. McCreary, Toronto</li>
    <li> Rarely do I write reviews on products, but this product is deserving of my time.  I ordered this thinking no product can be as good as these reviews are saying it is.  Well, I was wrong.  This product does work.  I have been using it for three months and have seen great improvement in the chin, jowl and neck area.  I&#x27;ve been blessed with not really looking my age, but everyone reaching their mid 50s ages to some extent.  The chin has shaped up and is more sculptured, the jowls have tightened up and the neck area has improved significantly.  Like others have said, I am not sure how it works, but if you are disciplined in using it every day you will see results.  It is well worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very very happy with my Envisage.  After I&#x27;d been using it for about 4 weeks, I could see the difference; when I&#x27;d been using it for about 6 weeks, my sister-in-law saw me and thought my face looked so good that she asked me if I&#x27;d had cosmetic surgery! Recently when I went for a facial the aesthetician congratulated me on my great skin tone.</li>
    <li> When I got this no box.. looks like I has been uesd...very dispoint.  I feel cheated...I was just hoping they say .. used or new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well this is second review for this item.. They have read my review and send me a another one with box. Great care for who buy on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for care.. Thank you again....</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. It may be my imagination, but I seemed to have more pronounced wrinkles after using it for awhile than I did when I started.</li>
    <li> I am a woman in my early fifties, and due to severe allergies I cannot use anti-aging creams.  I was frustrated that I was unable to do anything to slow down signs of aging, but then I discovered Envisage. I have been using Envisage for six weeks and I am thrilled with the results! It has improved my overall appearance including eyes and forehead but most noticeably, it has smoothed out my smile lines and folds and significantly tightened the skin under my chin. And the best part of the improvement is how natural it looks. For the first two weeks I used it for ten minutes twice a day and for the past four weeks I have been using it once a day for ten minutes. Family and friends have noticed the results and four friends have already purchased Envisage because of my improved appearance. I am so encouraged by the results that I will continue to regularly use Envisage and look forward to the results that prolonged usage will bring.</li>
    <li> I hesitated about ordering the EnvisageRenew because of its cost, but decided if it worked, it would be less expensive than the variety of creams and oils I&#x27;ve tried in the past that never worked.  I&#x27;ve been using the EnvisageRenew for almost six weeks now and I have to say that indeed it has made a very obvious positive difference in my facial tone and skin appearance.  My first indication of its positive effect came after only a week of using it when a friend commented &amp;#34;something Is different about you&amp;#34; and complimented my appearance.  I notice it most when I first get up in the morning and am surprised when I look in the bathroom mirror and it isn&#x27;t a sleepy, saggy face that greets me, but one that looks fresh and more youthful.  This product isn&#x27;t a magic cure for aging, but it certainly brings more grace to the process and is allowing me to develop the facial muscle tone that promotes a more youthful appearance.  I am very satisfied with this purchase and will continue using the EnvisageRenew because it works.  I plan to buy two more to give as gifts to my sisters because I can&#x27;t think of anything that they would appreciate more.  Thank you EnvisageRenew for a product that really works and is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Great little gadget. Have been using it for 2 months now and can say that my smile lines for sure look much better! Before this I have been doing Tal Reinhart&#x27;s exercises diligently every day and sometimes twice a day for 6 months and saw very little to no improvement not to mention that they are very time-consuming. I have also used FacialFlex and noticed an improvement, but nothing like what Envisage has done for me. This device is so much better than anything else I have tried before. I have come up with some additional exercises for eyes and smile lines (borrowed from Reinhart but with the use of Envisage). I still combine the use of this with facialflex since the latter is quick and easy and I am very happy with the results. Stick with the routine and add some good anti-wrinkle crems (I like all of Paulas Choice products) and I am sure you can see the improvements too!</li>
    <li> when you use it for a month, you feel and see results It is to be used</li>
    <li> I have been using this device for a few months and it has done wonders for my skin.  It is very easy to use and takes little time to use.</li>
    <li> this product really does lift the face. in addition to lifting the face, this product does not require any gel and the time it takes is minimal.</li>
    <li> The first Envisage I received had a manufacturing defect, i calked the company I was totally awed at the outstanding service I received, best ever, so personable  and considerate.  In a short time I received a replacement that has been working great and I am seeing the benefits,  so great customer service and truly a great product, highly highly recommend,  Mary H.</li>
    <li> This product works. Really works. I do not understand the why, but it has made a massive difference in my face. The lines are almost gone, the bags are starting to disappear, my skin is tighter and seems more uniform. Even my jaw line is more taught. I will be 60 soon, my husband just left me for a 39 year old and you had better believe this little wishbone has helped my shattered self-esteem to recover. BUY ONE and tell your friends. Use it when you watch TV and within 3 days from starting, you will see tightening. Best wishes, Ladies!</li>
    <li> I have used this device twice a day for over a month and experienced wonderful results, my facial muscles feel more tone and my jawline no longer shows the typical effects is gravity. This product is very effective, easy and quick to add into any daily routine. Like any exercise program, you must dedicate yourself to doing this consistently. I wholeheartedly recommend this facial toning product which is cheaper than surgery and painless to use.</li>
    <li> This item is Absolutely Incredible! People excercise to tone their body so it makes sense that the face needs toning to. In the beginning I used it more than twice a day and in 2 months I started seeing a difference even my sister &amp; niece said I looked great. My cheek bones are high and my jowls are gone. I turn 50 in January and I look younger now than I did in my early 40&#x27;s. I give it 5 stars. Excellent Device!</li>
    <li> I received one in December and really liked it for the 2 weeks that it worked. Contacted the seller and they sent me a new one that has worked perfectly ever since. I&#x27;ve only been using it once a day, but have seen a new &amp;#34;freshness&amp;#34; in my face. I can really feel the muscles in my face getting tired! I&#x27;m only 45 but adhere to the thinking of being proactive and starting to turn back time before the damage gets really bad.  Customer service was quick and excellent when I reported the first device not working...thanks Anita!</li>
    <li> pos 18/3/2014 I wrote about the excellent device….. I think this is one of the best out there…. But now I am writing about the excellent customer service. After a few months my device did not work like when it arrive, I wrote asking what to do , and the company  just send me a new one!!!  Really if you are concern about sagging or loosing definition in your face…. You have to buy this.    I have tried several things for the face, from thermage, fraxel, peelings, creams and more…. I saw this device and sincerely I was expecting to work… but this really works, It makes you face firmer and glow. If you already tried like me , another things, please try this!! You are not going to regret.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t go a day without using this.  What a product, and I have to confess when I get my sinus headache I use this on the temple and I feel so much better.  So thank you.</li>
    <li> I could not have discovered this product at a better time!  I adore my Nerium antiaging products but for super-stubborn areas like the neck area and facial indentations that have settled in for several decades, the added benefit of Envisage&#x27;s toning device gives me just the 1-2 punch I need!  I love people telling me I look 35 when - ahem! - I&#x27;m actually in my young-late 50&#x27;s ;-)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you EnvisageRenew for creating this easy-to-use, attractive product!</li>
    <li> I am a 61 year old female and have been using the Envisage facial exerciser for over 1 year and the results have been nothing short of incredible.  Friends who know me remark that I look refreshed, but don&#x27;t know exactly how I achieved these results since they know I don&#x27;t use injectables or believe in surgical procedures.  I wanted to avoid the &amp;#34;frozen face&amp;#34; outcome.  I just wanted to achieve the best version of myself and that is what I have done with this product.  It is so easy to use, takes very little time daily, and can travel in a handbag if desired.  Since using the Envisage facial exerciser, hooded eyes, cheek jowls and chicken neck have almost disappeared.  No one can believe I am in my 60&#x27;s, and I have maintained all the natural  expressiveness in my face.  The cost compared to the outcome is negligible.  This unique and extremely effective product comes highly and confidently endorsed by this user.</li>
    <li> I loved this product so much that I decided to buy one for my friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone over the age of 20 as we all start to lose skin elasticity after the age of 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed my wrinkles have disappeared and its a great way to get rid of wrinkles in a natural way!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I love that it&#x27;s non-invasive - an excellent alternative for someone who wants to look younger without harsh chemicals, surgery, needles, etc. Such a genius concept - tightening the face by through vibrations and exercises. The first time I tried the device, I instantly felt my facial muscles (that I didn&#x27;t even know I had!) tingling and tightening. Would recommend this product to anyone who wants to look more youthful without any harmful risks!</li>
    <li> I have been doing facial exercises for over a year and am a big fan. I wanted to up my game so ordered the Envisage Toning Device along with the Facial-Flex resistance band mouth exerciser and PY neckline slimmer. Now I have a little face gym in my bathroom and a regular daily exercise routine that&#x27;s fast, easy and effective. Though the most expensive equipment in my bathroom, I feel like the Envisage Toning Devise does as promoted and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it again.  My face feels refreshed, stimulated, exercised and loved with this simple devise.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found this product, as it is so easy and fun to use, and the best, gets visable results quick. I knew facial exersize is the key to improve facial skin looking and toning, tried some facial exersize by hands, but easily gave up as it is boring therefore hard to keep with it before get result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, want to comment on excellent customer service. Got email with instruction how to use the device, showed very warm and caring. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love this device. From the day I received it I have been using 2 times a day and I noticed the effect almost immediately! My face is very toned, and my neck, which is much more flaccid than my face is beginning to show changes.&lt;br /&gt;But most amazing is that my face was balanced: some years ago my smile began to not be even as one side of my face is not smiling and had an eyebrow lower than other (!). Today it is not so !!! My eyebrows are at the same height and my smile is balanced!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much. I will continue using and recommending for many years.</li>
    <li> I just got my Envisage yesterday.  Now for about 6 weeks I&#x27;ve been already using another weight training system that gave me great results, but there was still a little bit of tightening that was needed under my chin, jowl and outer jaw area.  When I used the Envisage, I immediately felt the tightening, and couldn&#x27;t believe the results I achieved....I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this device.  I&#x27;ll still utilize the other system, but don&#x27;t have to do all of the exercises, which saves me lots of time.  Also, for the negative reviews, the device can&#x27;t work if you don&#x27;t work with it.  Resistance and following the directions are imperative.  I&#x27;m pleased so far, and thank you for the product.</li>
    <li> I only received it yesterday so I don&#x27;t yet know if it will do anything but I am surprised at what it actually is.  This thing can&#x27;t cost more than two dollars to manufacture so why the high price?  I paid $129 for it - on sale!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is to be done with a series of facial exercises that you could do just using your two index fingers for resistance pressure.  If that little vibrator doesn&#x27;t truly add anything (such as stimulating blood flow), then the product is even more overpriced than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to give it a true test but if I don&#x27;t see any results in 4 weeks, I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything...</li>
    <li> This is a great item.  Purchased because I believed it is possible to build facial muscles to help give a more lifted and ageless appearance.  This indeed does happen when used consistently.  I have noticed my face and neck have more definition and eyes are more open.  Happy with results!  As a Pilates instructor I know about building muscles and this facial exerciser is worth the investment. Customer service is top notch too!  I was not paid to review and made a point to take the time to because of how pleased I am with results.</li>
    <li> It feels good, but have yet to see results. I received it in March and have been using it twice a day. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> Works great.. all I have to say..</li>
    <li> This is a great device and it works, especially on the vibration. My skin looks refreshed after using it. The person who invented this is so helpful and caring about her product or your concerns.</li>
