      <li>amazing, the best sunscreen I have ever used!</li>

      <li>At first I didn&#x27;t know what was causing it</li>
      <li>I am 66 and first started using sunscreen in the 1960s, about the time they first started talking about skin cancer.  </li>
      <li>At first 8 SPF was about it.  </li>
      <li>We got a house in 1992 and I began an incredibly ambitious backyard paradise in 1995.  </li>
      <li>This product does tend to be a bit sticky for 15 minutes after your first application.  </li>
      <li>This product does seem to be sweat-proof - although just to be certain I re-apply the cream once an hour if I&#x27;m going to be out for an athletic event lasting more than two hours.  </li>
      <li>Most of the time I didn&#x27;t care because they were only cheap white t-shirts under my construction vests.  </li>
      <li>the sunblock worth buying new beach clothes?</li>

      <li>I have mostly used Coppertone products over the years, but I have to say that the early ones only helped some.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also got a nice consistency that makes it very easy to apply - there are some lotions out there that are incredibly thick, take a very long time to absorb into your skin, and some even require that you \\&quot;rub\\&quot; the lotion between your fingers to \\&quot;warm\\&quot; it up in order to get a decent application consistency.  </li>

      <li>I purchased everyone new summer clothing for our vacation.</li>

    <li> I have been using Coppertone Sport sunblock almost everyday for years (30 to 50 SPF) but about 6 months ago I started seeing orange stains that DO NOT come out, around my collar on my work shirts. At first I didn&#x27;t know what was causing it but after a little research I found that I am not the only one. Apparently the \\&quot;Avobenzone\\&quot; is the culprit and from the reviews the only thing that will take it out is \\&quot;the works tub and shower cleaner\\&quot; I have a bag of shirts that I was just taking to the trash as I read the review. Now I will keep them and try to salvage the shirts but unfortunately I have to find a new sunblock. The reviews recommended Blue Lizard for a no staining good sunblock.</li>
    <li> Coppertone Sport with 50 SPF is one of the better sunscreens I&#x27;ve used over the years.  It claims to be \\&quot;ultra sweat-proof\\&quot; and pretty much is, for the most part.  I use this sunscreen a lot when I know I&#x27;m going to be outside all day long, such as when I&#x27;m at Comerica Park in Detroit working my television job.  In the months of June and July, the sun&#x27;s rays are their strongest.  In these months I apply it before going fishing, even though I&#x27;m a morning and evening fisherman.  This sunscreen doesn&#x27;t seem to wear off or migrate very easily.  This product also claims to be \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot;.  I can&#x27;t tell you if it is indeed waterproof, because I&#x27;ve never worn this stuff while in a swimming pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a pretty good product that does the job.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product has permanently stained all our clothing!!!  There is nothing that will remove it.  Coppertone has no warnings or remedies on its web site nor will it acknowledge this problem despite all the complaints.  My brand new Columbia shirt is ruined!</li>
    <li> I am frankly surprised to see this product get anything but five-star reviews.  I am 66 and first started using sunscreen in the 1960s, about the time they first started talking about skin cancer.  I am extremely fair-skinned, to such an extent that on a hot summer day my nose will actually blister within fifteen minutes without protection.  I have mostly used Coppertone products over the years, but I have to say that the early ones only helped some.  At first 8 SPF was about it.  Then they went to 15 SPF and so on up the ladder.  I also used other products.    We got a house in 1992 and I began an incredibly ambitious backyard paradise in 1995.  I spent about nine summers back there, pretty much sunup to sundown.  Somewhere along the line I came across this product, and I have to say that it is everything they say it is.  For me at least.  I apply it in the morning before I go out and usually not again during the day unless I wash hell out of my forearms when I stop for lunch.  There have been days when I got so sweaty that I actually changed t-shirts three times, each time removing a t-shirt that was absolutely sopping wet with sweat.  I looked like I&#x27;d jumped into a swimming pool, got out, and had been walking around for a few minutes.  This sunscreen honestly held up to that.  I have found that the first time each year I will burn a little.  Thereafter I burn hardly at all.  Occasionally, a little redness after a whole day of sun.  If I reapplied the product, I might have better results, but I never do, except when I&#x27;m painting and have to wash up for lunch.  As for the staining, it has not been a problem for me, but my work shirts are 100% pure cotton.  I don&#x27;t know if that makes a difference or not.  I wear them because I sweat so much when I&#x27;m working.  In sum, I think it&#x27;s a terrific product.  If it will work for me, it will work for anyone.</li>
    <li> This product, while doing a fine job of protecting me from the sun, stained my clothes an orange/yellow color. I have had a terrible time trying to get the stains out, with only limited success. I am returning this product to the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> amazing, the best sunscreen I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunblock for about 4 years now, and I like to run at least five miles a day (plus I have incredibly fair skin).  This product does seem to be sweat-proof - although just to be certain I re-apply the cream once an hour if I&#x27;m going to be out for an athletic event lasting more than two hours.  I also re-apply after my run.  Since I only use this sunblock for sports, I have never noticed any staining of my clothing (although I usually use it wearing high-performance sports fabric).  I guess you can say that its unlikely to stain your sports clothing.  The website stated that this sunblock won&#x27;t sting your eyes if it runs - this is untrue for me.  I have to take care when using it on my face, as I do find that it will sting my eyes (although not that badly).  This is usually easily fixed with a eye drops (just a single drop).  This product does tend to be a bit sticky for 15 minutes after your first application.  It may also leave a bit of sheen on your skin.  Overall, I think this is an excellent product to use if you are engaging in outdoor sports.  It&#x27;s slightly \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; quality makes it difficult for your body to sweat it off.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years, spend lots of time outdoors, and still have extremely fair skin (plus my older sun spots have continued to fade) - so in my book, it&#x27;s a highly effective sunblock.  It&#x27;s also got a nice consistency that makes it very easy to apply - there are some lotions out there that are incredibly thick, take a very long time to absorb into your skin, and some even require that you \\&quot;rub\\&quot; the lotion between your fingers to \\&quot;warm\\&quot; it up in order to get a decent application consistency.  This sunblock spreads very easily, and is absorbed into your skin within 15 minutes (ie, you won&#x27;t be able to see it anymore).  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> REALLY disappointed  :(  Stained brand new clothing yellow-orange. No idea how to get the stains out either</li>
    <li> I purchased everyone new summer clothing for our vacation. Got back from vacation and did all of the laundry only to discover that everything was ruined! Orange-brown stains on everything! Mostly around the collars and bottoms of sleeves. I&#x27;ve tried three different stain removers and nothing helped. Hundreds of dollars of clothes destroyed. Do not buy this product!!!</li>
    <li> Stains clothes and towels bright yellow.  Cannot seriously believe that a brand that has been around for so many decades, a company so huge, cannot do better than to ruin all of its customers&#x27; swimsuits, tennis clothes and towels. WHY IS THIS PRODUCT STILL ON THE SHELF?</li>
    <li> Many of these ingredients on the label are on the EWG website for being toxic/carcinogenic.  Anytime you see the word fragrance, it is derived from synthetic chemicals which are un-regulated.  This society has to get over its obsession with scent.  It&#x27;s the reason there are so many health problems on the rise.  Do your homework, folks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned, grey/blue eyes &amp; a red head. I live in southern California in a desert region. The sun is my enemy. My dad used to bake himself on weekends &amp; suffered several bouts of skin cancer during his last 20 years of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do avoid the sun &amp; try to wear appropriate clothing &amp; a hat. I also apply this sunscreen every day to exposed extremities and my head.  I&#x27;ve had some sun damage, which my dermatologist freezes off, but no precancerous growths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product applies easily [add a little water] and dries quickly. I use the spf50 as if I use a higher spf it tends to make me feel edgy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only really downside is that, as I comb my hair [losing it] after I apply it to my scalp, it tends to soften the plastic teeth of some of my combs &amp; they get stuck together. Wonder what that means??</li>
    <li> This sunscreen lotion keeps in your skill even when sweating or into the wáter. Smells fairly neutral, I like it.</li>
    <li> Used this on the beach and it ruined my white cover up and hat. Nothing will get it out, not bleach, not scrubbing. It&#x27;s going in the trash. If I could give this minus stars I would. If it stains clothes it shouldn&#x27;t be on the market.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen for a vacation to Hawaii. I thought the sunscreen was working very well initially (blocking the sun) until I brought the clothes to a laundrymat. After washing the clothes, I noticed that all my whites had yellow stains. I had no idea what the cause of it was but soon realized it was the sunscreen. What a ripoff and it destroyed my clothes. Is there any way to get the stain out? Is Coppertone or Amazon doing anything for customers?</li>
    <li> Coppertone ruined two of my Vineyard Vines cotton shirts I wore while playing golf this week.&lt;br /&gt;The orange stains will not come out.&lt;br /&gt;I give it zero stars.&lt;br /&gt;It is junk.</li>
    <li> I have used all different kinds of sunblocks and found this one to work pretty well.  I start off the summer using SPF 50 and once my skin is used to the sun I switch over to 30.  I burn fairly easily even with SPF my first few times in the sun, but with this I didn&#x27;t burn at all!  I did notice a slight orange mark like other readers have complained about on a towel I used but i bleached the towel and it came right out.  I reapplied this after swimming and it didn&#x27;t feel overly oily or sticky.  Will use again next summer.</li>
    <li> the coppertone sport sunscreen is something we use all the time. it dries fast and soaks in easily. good for when you play outdoors sports in the heat and sun.</li>
    <li> This is my working out sunscreen. It doesn&#x27;t sweat off, isn&#x27;t obnoxiously perfumed, and I don&#x27;t notice stains because I wear a lot of dark colored and non-sexy outfits when I work out. I don&#x27;t get the negative reviews... Just keep your expensive white outfits away from the sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I do not burn or tan when I wear this while working out and it&#x27;s not running into my eyes.</li>
    <li> Stains clothes where ever they touch the sun block.</li>
    <li> I used to use coppertone&#x27;s oil free sunscreen for many years but I can&#x27;t find SPF 50 anymore so I switched to this. I used to like it until I discovered the Target generic dupe of this. Coppertone sport feels greasy and looks shiny for hours -- it never seems to soak in. after some time passes, it seems to clump or something and shows up as white in the creases of my arms.  When I go for a long walk or run, I come home with a film of dirt stuck to my legs.  None of these things happen with the Target dupe of this sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Provides sunblock BUT at the cost of your Clothes.&lt;br /&gt;To read their warning that it stains your clothes you have to peel off the rear label&lt;br /&gt;and continue reading the product information under it. This effectively hides the&lt;br /&gt;fact that this will permanently stain your white clothing from the consumer.&lt;br /&gt;Is the sunblock worth buying new beach clothes? Don&#x27;t use it !</li>
    <li> stains clothing orange!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Really I can&#x27;t say any more. My clothing was ruined by this product and I can&#x27;t find anything that will get the stains out.</li>
    <li> awful product. I can believe that a brand like coppertone would sell a product that does this to peoples clothes!! And not to mention, it left me all streaky even though it appeared I applied it evenly.</li>
    <li> WARNING: DO NOT BUY COPPERTONE SPORT SUNSCREEN SPRAY SPF 30&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently bought a bottle of Coppertone Sport Sunscreen spray SPF 30. I used it to protect my skin while on the beach and playing golf during my vacation. When I returned home and washed my 4 white, cotton and high performance golf shirts, there appeared yellow stains in the places where I had sprayed sunscreen (for example on my shoulders and neck). The stains did not appear until the items were washed. The items are now ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Coppertone Customer Service acknowledge they have received other complaints, when I called to inquire if I could use anything to remove the stains, they said no. Now that the item has been washed, there is no solution to my problem. They said that there is a warning on the bottle saying the product may stain or damage some fabrics. They claim the problem is the Avobenzone ingredient, yet they have no plans to re-formulate the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fabrics in my sport shirts were intended to be used when playing sports. How could a company market a Sport sunscreen product to be used when playing sports and yet it stains sports fabrics? As a prior Product Manager for Kraft Foods, I believe their approach is deceitful.</li>
    <li> This used to be the only sunblock I&#x27;d buy because I liked how it &#x27;felt&#x27; compared to other sunblock (not greasy and not thick).  I&#x27;ve tried it in several different SPF&#x27;s including 15, 30, and 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over that time period I had HUGE problems with it ruining my white shirts.  Most of the time I didn&#x27;t care because they were only cheap white t-shirts under my construction vests.  At the end of the summer I&#x27;d just throw them away because they were yellow-orange from this sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I&#x27;ve tried to remember to only use this sunblock with dark colored shirts.  Unfortunately I sometimes forget. This past weekend I turned two pairs of my favorite swimming trunks yellow.  I am making a mental note to stop buying this sun block.  I really hope I can find some that won&#x27;t turn my whites into yellows.</li>
    <li> Not only does it stain your clothing orange, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as other sunscreens. But really, the orange stains on my clothes would be enough. I wish it were possible to give zero stars. A ridiculous product.</li>
    <li> It is very effective as a sweat-proof sunscreen in a nudist colony.  If you are the type of person who occasionally \\&quot;applies\\&quot; clothing, Coppertone Sport will prove incompatible.</li>
