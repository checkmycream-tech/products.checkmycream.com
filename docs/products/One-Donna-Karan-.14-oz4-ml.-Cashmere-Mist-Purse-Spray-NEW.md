      <li>So nice , very pleasent  .</li>
      <li>The product is good,  I am apparently allergic...</li>
      <li>The perfume&#x27;s smell is real nice, but the size is not worth the price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really love the soft and sensual fragrance of Cashmere Mist, and glad I could find it in a purse size.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s Donna Karan&#x27;s Cashmere Mist which is a pleasant, lasting fragrance.</li>
      <li>love this scent and wish I could afford the large bottle.  </li>
      <li>If you need cosmetics, use something made with fair trade without animal testing, such as MAC.</li>
      <li>the small purse spray is a great size to fit in my purse and it&#x27;s there when I need it.</li>
      <li>I received the Donna Karan Cashmere purse spray quite quickly and it has a soft lovely scent.  </li>
      <li>It puts a smile on my wife and daughters faces.  </li>
      <li>It was just the right size.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear cologne often, so this was just right.</li>
      <li>Yes I am very pleased with the purchase And will buy more soon thanks of having the small purse size</li>
      <li>Love the smell but was a bit smaller</li>
      <li>Will be more cautious next time.</li>
      <li>The seller delivered it on time and it was exactly what was advertised.</li>
      <li>but she feel in love with this new one Cashmere and wants to order a larger size for her dressing table, so</li>
      <li>It smells great, but I thought that it was a little bit bigger than what it appears in the photo.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much...</li>
      <li>Thanks to the seller for this great&lt;br /&gt;size</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes away too fast, and the bottle leaks</li>
      <li>I really love Cashmere Mist but standard size is too big to carry around.  </li>
      <li>CLASSIC SCENT.  </li>
      <li>NICE, LIGHT, SLIGHTLY FLORAL BUT NOT SWEET.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend to anyone</li>
      <li>This purchase was one of my high lights.</li>
      <li>Ladies love little things like this.</li>
      <li>I breathe varnish and most harsh cleaners without incident.</li>
      <li>Someone should have to be hugging you to smell it, not in an elevator where the odor lingers like wet dog, only more offensively.</li>
      <li>I was very surprised when I discovered it is cheaper at Macy&#x27;s, which comes in a box of 7.</li>
      <li>This is a small and convenient purse item of one of my favorite fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>I think this was either old, a knock off or another fragrance because it&#x27;s NOTHING close to what I am using for Cashmere Mist.</li>
      <li>It smells horribly different from the real thing.</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance (and probably always will), but this purse sized spray is much smaller than any I&#x27;ve owned in the past.</li>
      <li>I would have liked to have purchased a bottle of cologne, but this is just too expensive, even with discount.</li>
      <li>I ran it under hot water in case some of the perfume had dried and was blocking the catheter</li>
      <li>Received a watered down &#x27;knock-off&#x27; version of the real thing.</li>

    <li> Perfect for my purse!!!!!</li>
    <li> The product arrived broken; I was really looking forward to the receipt of this product for Christmas as a stocking stuffer - very disappointed that the shipment was cracked, but smelled very good when received!</li>
    <li> This item is perfect purse size for DKNY Cashmere Mist lovers.&lt;br /&gt;Transaction was perfect. My Wife loved this as a gift.</li>
    <li> Love it smells good, and is a very good price.  Would recommend for travel or to have as an extra!</li>
    <li> Donna Karen Cashmere mini mist is wonderful. I love the fragrance. It&#x27;s perfect for the purse or cosmetic bag. It&#x27;s what I expected and it came promply in the mail.</li>
    <li> This is a small and convenient purse item of one of my favorite fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend it, and may order again.</li>
    <li> LOVE CASHMERE PERFUME, CHEAPER ON AMAZON THAN NM STORE, I SAVED 35 DOLLOR&#x27;SON  THE LARGE BOTTLE, I ALSO BOUGHT THE SMALL MIST TO KEEP IN MY PURSE</li>
    <li> I just received my, Donna Karan Cashmere Mist perfume in the mail. As soon as I opened up the package I put it on immediately. I LOVE IT!! It smells so wonderful. The size of the of the bottle is so perfect for my purse. Now, it states that it is a mist spray but it is a roll on. That is not a problem for me. I prefer the roll on anyway. I am going to purchase the larger bottle of Donna Karan Cashmere mist to keep at home. I am very happy. I have found my signature perfume... Yaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy... LOL</li>
    <li> Yes I am very pleased with the purchase And will buy more soon thanks of having the small purse size</li>
    <li> Love this perfume and want to try more Donna Karan. My discovery of Cashmere was through a sample in the local paper.</li>
    <li> Cashmere Mist was a great purchase. I think it&#x27;s fine for day or an evening out. I plan to keep this in use for a long time.</li>
    <li> This scent is one of the nicest and longest-lasting I&#x27;ve ever had. The reason I only gave it two stars is that it&#x27;s a very small size at $19. I left a review for the seller stating just that. They asked me to remove my review. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this small size.</li>
    <li> I received the Donna Karan Cashmere purse spray quite quickly and it has a soft lovely scent.  I used it once without any problem and placed it in my purse.  A few days later I brought it back out to use again and the pump was not working, ergo the product would not come out.  I ran it under hot water in case some of the perfume had dried and was blocking the catheter but it still didn&#x27;t work.  A MITE disappointed.  BTW, the Donna Karan Cashmere body lotion has a prettier scent, not quite as jarring to the senses initially.</li>
    <li> I have had this purse spray in the past.  The scent on this one was not the same.  It missed that cashmere smell.</li>
    <li> Not very happy with quantity. Bottle was a quarter of the way gone. Smells wonderful. Fits perfect in make up bag.</li>
    <li> Ladies love little things like this. This is the perfect gift for that someone.&lt;br /&gt;ooxxx oox  x x o o</li>
    <li> too small, my fault though... thought info stated 1.4 0z., not .14oz. kind of a crummy gift for my sister!</li>
    <li> I have loved this for years, but the price has always kept me away. Thanks to the seller for this great&lt;br /&gt;size at a great price.Very efficient and quick with the order, great job.</li>
    <li> love this scent and wish I could afford the large bottle.  this is a great way to have it and not have to pay so much</li>
    <li> I really love the soft and sensual fragrance of Cashmere Mist, and glad I could find it in a purse size.</li>
    <li> Kind of pricey for it&#x27;s size but worth it.  Alot of oompf for such a small amount.  Perfect size for carrying in my purse.</li>
    <li> i like cashmere mist it smells great i  would recommend it to other women.i do plan on reodering the perfume.</li>
    <li> Been wanting to try this fragrance for a while, but did not want to buy the big bottle. So glad it came in this affordable trial size. TY</li>
    <li> This purchase was one of my high lights. This little bottle of heaven gives me the opportunity to refresh my fragrance whenever never needed and wherever needed. I love it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell but was a bit smaller then I expected.</li>
    <li> Purchased this purse size and it has lasted a ling time because a little goes a very long way..nice scent</li>
    <li> The product is good,  I am apparently allergic...it gave me a headache. I am giving it away to someone who can appreciate the smell.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT AS A TESTER AND LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.  PERFECT SCENT FOR  AN EVENING OUT.  NICE, LIGHT, SLIGHTLY FLORAL BUT NOT SWEET.  CLASSIC SCENT.  GREAT JOB BY DK.  WILL PURHCASE  PURSE SPRAY AND THE LARGER BOTTLE NEXT TIME.  QUICK ARRIVAL AND GOOD PACKAGING.  VERY PLEASED</li>
    <li> Received a watered down &#x27;knock-off&#x27; version of the real thing.Not worth the $14.00 spent on it. Will be more cautious next time.</li>
    <li> The best !!!!,I have more guys come up to me and say they love my Perfume ,thank u Donna Karan .</li>
    <li> I love her jacket that I got at a thrift store for 87.00. It fits like it was made for me. I ran into this perfume and it made my lungs close up. Whatever&#x27;s in this products shouldn&#x27;t be breathed in-there&#x27;s no standards on perfumes and cosmetics-anything could be in there-embalming fluid which was banned, and anything else. I breathe varnish and most harsh cleaners without incident. PLEASE don&#x27;t layer this with lots of  other smelly products. If you need cosmetics, use something made with fair trade without animal testing, such as MAC. It works incredibly well but it costs money. Try a company called Sage. I like their little roll-on which you can&#x27;t really O.D with. The one I like is called Pearl. It wasn&#x27;t anywhere near this expensive, either. Someone should have to be hugging you to smell it, not in an elevator where the odor lingers like wet dog, only more offensively. I don&#x27;t get a headache from a wet dog.</li>
    <li> I really love Cashmere Mist but standard size is too big to carry around.  I love how convenient this is.</li>
    <li> I love to wear &amp;#34;Cashmere&amp;#34;, Donna Karan and was so glad to find a few items available and at a great price. I can wear it more often. Thanks so much...</li>
    <li> When I ran out, I found them at Macy&#x27;s here in Hawaii.  I was very surprised when I discovered it is cheaper at Macy&#x27;s, which comes in a box of 7.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance.  Its perfect size for travel, to use on the go, or after a workout.  Just such a convenient size for me, and to give as a gift.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance (and probably always will), but this purse sized spray is much smaller than any I&#x27;ve owned in the past.</li>
    <li> So nice , very pleasent  .</li>
    <li> perfect fit in my bag. came in a timely matter and just order another bottle</li>
    <li> The perfume&#x27;s smell is real nice, but the size is not worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;It goes away too fast, and the bottle leaks</li>
    <li> Too small for this price.</li>
    <li> It smells great, but I thought that it was a little bit bigger than what it appears in the photo. For 10 bucks it was too small. I will purchase a larger size next time.</li>
    <li> I love the fragents of Cashmere Mist. It is not to strong, not to floral, not to woodz. It is just perfact for a West Texas girl who likes to smell nice, but not pressy if that makes sense....the small purse spray is a great size to fit in my purse and it&#x27;s there when I need it.</li>
    <li> Leaked out in the box.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, fast delivery, will reorder</li>
    <li> my wife loves this and thats all that counts, it smells great and i wiold reccomend this for valentines day</li>
    <li> will only wear this brand....it was perfect to bring on the cruise or anywhere for that matter...never knew it came like this...love, love, love</li>
    <li> This is a purse-sized atomizer. Sufficient for the purpose. It&#x27;s Donna Karan&#x27;s Cashmere Mist which is a pleasant, lasting fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is exactly right for fitting in a cosmetic bag or an evening purse!  Well packaged, too, and arrived on time for a very important party!  Would highly recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> This was as expected.  It was just the right size.  I don&#x27;t wear cologne often, so this was just right.</li>
    <li> Great purse size.&lt;br /&gt;Soft, delicate fragrance if that&#x27;s what someone is looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to any age female.</li>
    <li> This is not authentic. It smells horribly different from the real thing.</li>
    <li> It puts a smile on my wife and daughters faces.  Great scent!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anyone with a girlfriend or wife.</li>
    <li> Is very compact, does not take up a lot of room and perfect for carrying in you purse when you need to refresh your fragrance during the day.</li>
    <li> Very floral and a little cloying.  Lasts a long time. Reminds me of something my grandmother might wear except she wouldn&#x27;t wear something so heavy.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is perfect for day or evening. It is the perfect size to carry in your purse or overnight bag. The seller delivered it on time and it was exactly what was advertised. I will purchase from them again. Bonus: I also got a coupon from them for a free gift with order!</li>
    <li> I think this was either old, a knock off or another fragrance because it&#x27;s NOTHING close to what I am using for Cashmere Mist. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This wqas a gift for my daughter because she likes this scent.  I would have liked to have purchased a bottle of cologne, but this is just too expensive, even with discount. However, item arrived as described and within promised shipping time.</li>
    <li> It is a nice size, fits in your purse, smells good.Would reccomand to a  friend.  The spray was a ggod price</li>
    <li> This was also a thank you gift for a friend to use on her vacation trip and she dearly loved it.  Her favorite had been Lou Lou  by Cacharel but she feel in love with this new one Cashmere and wants to order a larger size for her dressing table, so that was good news, love it when they love their token gifts.</li>
