      <li>It works good but is very greasy</li>
      <li>I experienced extremely dry, itchy and flaky skin for many years.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It seems oily on the onset but the oil is absorbed with a bit of rubbing, leaving a healthy, matte look.</li>
      <li>and it goes on smooth, not greasy.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t they use this in more skin, face and hand products where the aim is to absorb the stuff in the first place???\\&quot;</li>

      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Totally absorbs (after adequate massaging) and I&#x27;m thinking \\&quot;why</li>
      <li>Works into my dry skin easily and leaves it feeling soft.</li>
      <li>I want a body butter to be creamy, not hard.</li>
      <li>The scent is a nice, subtle citrus scent which will not overpower your fragrance.  </li>
      <li>This cream feels a bit gritty when first applied, but smooths out after some rubbing.  </li>
      <li>First time I used was at night on lips and hands next morning</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also pretty solid.</li>
      <li>The gist is that it is quite affordable and plentiful and really does a tremendous job at keeping the skin moisturized and at healing the skin after exposure to the harsh elements.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use it as a face moisturizer and it is such a great option to expensive face creams.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to perfumes, and it set off my sinuses.</li>
      <li>Once in your hand it melts into a soft lotion feel and goes on with ease.</li>
      <li>(I didn&#x27;t know it could get so soft) and got rid of all the flakes, dryness and itchiness.</li>
      <li>It really helps my dry hands.</li>
      <li>Fast forward almost 20 years later, and after a lot of experiments with other products, I am still pining away for my Shea Butter Formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <li> This moisturizer is the BEST moisturizer that I have used. I experienced extremely dry, itchy and flaky skin for many years. I tried every lotion in the drugstore. But, I discovered that the lotions was making my condition worse, because of the water content in lotions. This Palmer&#x27;s shea butter formula has softened my skin (I didn&#x27;t know it could get so soft) and got rid of all the flakes, dryness and itchiness. This is truly a lifesaver for people with extremely dry skin! I am happy now!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a friend who knew that I was trying to make a physical improvement \\&quot;ritual\\&quot; I perform more comfortable and successful. For the price, I didn&#x27;t think I had anything to lose, but it was successful beyond my expectations! Totally absorbs (after adequate massaging) and I&#x27;m thinking \\&quot;why don&#x27;t they use this in more skin, face and hand products where the aim is to absorb the stuff in the first place???\\&quot; Of course corporate logic stepped in and disabused my wandering mind: the cost! God forbid a product which makes skin soft and supple should sell at anything less than some high-end, animal-tested, cosmetic company price! But for me, loved the stuff and will be getting tons more.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak to how well it works. I opened the jar and immediately decided I couldn&#x27;t use it. The scent is not natural shea, but chemically. I&#x27;m sensitive to perfumes, and it set off my sinuses. It&#x27;s also pretty solid. I was expecting something creamier. I have 100% shea butter for the times I need it. I want a body butter to be creamy, not hard.</li>
    <li> It makes me feel moisturized all day. I put on face before sleep and on my feet.  I Love it.</li>
    <li> The scent is a nice, subtle citrus scent which will not overpower your fragrance.  This formula is excellent to minimize the impact of winter on your skin.</li>
    <li> This cream feels a bit gritty when first applied, but smooths out after some rubbing.  It&#x27;s okay and I&#x27;ll use it up, but would not buy another jar.</li>
    <li> Works into my dry skin easily and leaves it feeling soft. wasn&#x27;t sure when I first saw it - it looks like solid shortening in the jar. Once in your hand it melts into a soft lotion feel and goes on with ease. Have found it is a great night cream on my face and neck. My skin is looking far less wrinkled. Have recommended it to family and friends.</li>
    <li> It really helps my dry hands. Can&#x27;t find it in the store anymore. The only thing i don&#x27;t  like it was cheaper when i couls find it in the store and it was a bigger container</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim and am glad I took the chance on just shea butter.  First time I used was at night on lips and hands next morning smooth lips and hands, WOW!  Now I use on feet, legs, arms as well as hands and lips.  I will also use together with just lanolin amazing soft skin.</li>
    <li> I love Palmer&#x27;s Shea Butter.  I use it all over my body and it goes on smooth, not greasy.  When I can&#x27;t find this product locally in retail stores, I don&#x27;t hesitate to order it online.  It&#x27;s just that good.</li>
    <li> I know where to get it now!</li>
    <li> I found this product on a discount grocer&#x27;s shelf locally over a year and a half ago and recently ran out and ordered it on Amazon.  It works wonders as a moisturizer in a dry climate.  I use it as a face moisturizer and it is such a great option to expensive face creams.</li>
    <li> Just great for your skin. Highly recommend! Makes skin soft and smooth, and lasts for hours. Will come back for more.</li>
    <li> Best product I have ever used on my hair. It is also good for every other part of your body too</li>
    <li> Absorbs into the skin quickly and is not overly greasy. I use it around my eyes to reduce the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Good skin for elbows, knees etc.</li>
    <li> I use this on my dry heels in winter and my finger nails and cuticles also. This is a good product for very dry skin problems.</li>
    <li> Awesome for pregnancy! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I first used this product in my teenage years, and I can still remember that healthy, youthful glow.  Fast forward almost 20 years later, and after a lot of experiments with other products, I am still pining away for my Shea Butter Formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it during last year&#x27;s harsh winter and at one point my mother commented on my &amp;#34;glowing, flawless&amp;#34; skin texture.  I let her in on my secret, and she rolled her eyes at me.  I said, &amp;#34;Really mum,&amp;#34; she said, &amp;#34;Ok.&amp;#34; as in, I don&#x27;t believe you.  The gist is that it is quite affordable and plentiful and really does a tremendous job at keeping the skin moisturized and at healing the skin after exposure to the harsh elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems oily on the onset but the oil is absorbed with a bit of rubbing, leaving a healthy, matte look. The glow eventually spreads out evenly during the day, never dominating any part of your face.  One thing I notice is that it helps to do a facial scrub once a week while using this product to boost its absorbency. I have a beautiful ebony skin color and what this formula does is that it evens out my skin color with a slight lightening/glowing effect.  Now that I&#x27;m done praising Palmer&#x27;s Shea Butter Formula, I&#x27;m going to pull out my card and purchase a jar because I couldn&#x27;t find any at my local Walmart store last weekend.</li>
    <li> I usually develop cracked foot callous in winter, this has helped so far this winter.</li>
    <li> It works good but is very greasy</li>
