      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>This brush is amazing.</li>
      <li>Really nice replacement for the Nars Brush which sells for $55 I believe?</li>
      <li>However, it is very soft and excellent for adding contour below my cheeks and blending.</li>
      <li>The handle is also made of bamboo i believe which just adds a nice touch to it and makes it feel more quality.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush!</li>
      <li>Its an amazing product, easy to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
      <li>Way cheaper than most contouring brushes.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very durable, great for contouring.</li>
      <li>I use the brush for bronzer on my cheak bones for more definition</li>
      <li>Okay brush though</li>
      <li>but I might as well try to get my money&#x27;s worth and not toss it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good enough.  </li>
      <li>This brush is great for a sharp contour.</li>
      <li>It is a great dupe for the NARS Ita brush which is about 3 or 4 times more expensive, probably more now that its sold out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft and better than spending $40 or $50 on the NARS or Becca brush I originally wanted.</li>
      <li>I have only found amazing reviews about it.</li>
      <li>For the price and convenience I would say its worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>The free brush that came with my bronzer is actually fuller and more useful.</li>
      <li>Arrived fast and on time, good quality no weird smell, bristles are soft but firm enough to contour, and the word handle is a nice touch, easy to hold.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s makes blending SO much easier!</li>
      <li>This does exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
      <li>This may not be an exact dupe for the NARS brush</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s pretty darn close, it&#x27;s not as dense</li>
      <li>Amazing contour brush and not crazy expensive :) get it.</li>
      <li>but this is super soft, blends my bronzer out like a dream and the handle is almost identical to the nars one</li>
      <li>Super soft and shipped very fast, i live in the US.</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t have much control.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t shed and is very soft!</li>
      <li>Could be a little more dense</li>
      <li>I use this brush everyday and it has totally replaced my old contour brush but its nothing AMAZING</li>
      <li>I use the brush to clear off my vanity table.</li>
      <li>The brush is far too soft to make any difference when contouring.</li>
      <li>The brush is so soft but still can give you a defined line for contouring below the cheekbones and jawline.</li>
      <li>It has soft bristles.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get this if you expect firm bristles, they are very soft and gentle but apply my Nars Laguna bronzer really well along my cheekbones.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay. Nothing to write home about.</li>
    <li> Would love to try out this brush! I have only found amazing reviews about it. Hope it gets restocked soon so I can buy it ASAP!!</li>
    <li> Love it for contouring!!</li>
    <li> Super soft and shipped very fast, i live in the US. I do not have the nars ita brust but this is super soft, blends my bronzer out like a dream and the handle is almost identical to the nars one so you can hokd it the same. The handle is also made of bamboo i believe which just adds a nice touch to it and makes it feel more quality. If ur looking for a dupe for nars ita brush at a fraction of the cost id get this.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It&#x27;s soft and better than spending $40 or $50 on the NARS or Becca brush I originally wanted.</li>
    <li> I have this and the Nars ITA brush.  These bristles are a little denser, softer, and longer than the ITA.  The size is comparable.  This one doesn&#x27;t carve the line as well as the ITA, but it does help to contour with a softer line.  It doesn&#x27;t blend out as well as the ITA.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong I use this brush everyday and it has totally replaced my old contour brush but its nothing AMAZING like I thought it was going to be. For the price and convenience I would say its worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Really nice replacement for the Nars Brush which sells for $55 I believe? Don&#x27;t get this if you expect firm bristles, they are very soft and gentle but apply my Nars Laguna bronzer really well along my cheekbones.</li>
    <li> This brush is great for contouring with creams.  Could be a little more dense but it does the job.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy. Perfect for contouring.</li>
    <li> Works excellent for contouring.  Way cheaper than most contouring brushes.  Bristles are softer than others though.</li>
    <li> Great substitute for the nars brush that goes for $100. I use the brush for bronzer on my cheak bones for more definition and I love it!</li>

    <li> This brush is amazing. Was looking for something similar to the NARS brush, that wasn&#x27;t a ridiculous price. Sorry but I&#x27;m not going to spend $80 bucks or whatever it is on one makeup brush. This does exactly what I wanted it to do. Arrived fast and on time, good quality no weird smell, bristles are soft but firm enough to contour, and the word handle is a nice touch, easy to hold. Would defiantly buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a couple of days and can&#x27;t testify to it&#x27;s durability.  However, it is very soft and excellent for adding contour below my cheeks and blending.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush! I wanted the Nars one but was not willing to pay the price.  This was a great dupe.</li>

    <li> I was NOT impressed with this at all. The brush is far too soft to make any difference when contouring. I use the brush to clear off my vanity table. Seems like a steep price for a cleaning tool- but I might as well try to get my money&#x27;s worth and not toss it!</li>
    <li> Perfect dupe for the Nars Ita. I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 months and it&#x27;s very durable, great for contouring.</li>
    <li> Great brush for the price. This brush is great for a sharp contour.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good enough.  It has soft bristles.</li>
