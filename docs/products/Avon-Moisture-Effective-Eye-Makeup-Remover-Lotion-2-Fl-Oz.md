      <li>This eye makeup remover was okay</li>
      <li>I have used this product for more than 10 years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many kinds of eye makeup remover.  </li>
      <li>My favorite eye makeup remover ever.</li>
      <li>This stuff is gentle, doesn&#x27;t sting or goop-up my eyes, and it works very easily!  </li>
      <li>how well I clean them at night, I always find more has wept around my eyes by morning).</li>
      <li>I generally wear waterproof mascara and from the reviews it seemed like people were quite happy with the effectiveness of this eye makeup remover.</li>
      <li>It takes everything off quickly, easily, and smoothly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle and not oily like many others!</li>
      <li>I used to use this because it was so cheap like 99 cents a bottle.</li>
      <li>Dear lord it is fantastic.</li>
      <li>so moisture is important to my skin)</li>
      <li>But its a good product for removing makeup and is sensitive for your eyes.</li>
      <li>Now I use jojoba oil and so far so good.</li>
      <li>The product works great, is very gentle and completely removes my eye makeup.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased to report that it removed my mascara very quickly with minimal fuss, and I loved the moisturizing effect it had on my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My sister told me it was super cheap on Amazon.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was in a fog for 20 minutes afterward, and my eyelashes were still full of mascara, but softened and gunky.</li>
      <li>It took off my makeup but the smell is so strong that I can&#x27;t help but feel like I&#x27;m rubbing pure plastic/chemicals on my eyelids.</li>
      <li>Gentle, easy to use,</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty gentle and works fine if you dab it on a q-tip and run it along your eye-line.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After using this product my eye area feels nice and moist, not sore or harshly dry at all.  </li>
      <li>very gentle</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try a new product to remove my mascara, I had been using liquid remover and was looking forward to the lotion.</li>
      <li>Pleased especially with delivery time and safety seal under the cap!</li>
      <li>I prefer to remove my contacts first ..</li>
      <li>I have tried many over the years, and I always come back to this product.</li>
      <li>Thank you Avon for being consistent with your products.</li>
      <li>this is a remover LOTION, so its made to feel rich, but apparently that is not my preference.</li>
      <li>The product really works well to remove your eye makeup (or Halloween face paint) at the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>I ordered Neutrogena Hydrating Eye Makeup Remover Lotion, and it works very well, without irritation.</li>
      <li>I use this to gently remove the makeup around my eyes in the morning (no matter</li>
      <li>I thought it was gentle</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my eyes.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t seem to get mascara off very well with this</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle and not greasy.</li>
      <li>It really need a lot of product to somewhat remove eye makeup.</li>
      <li>(by using too much)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a squeeze bottle dispenser and way too much comes out.</li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped with my waterproof stuff but for the others, it comes right off with no harsh scrubbing.</li>
      <li>This stuff is my favorite for taking off my eye makeup and it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue like other removers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>it compares to other products ive used that cost much more.</li>
      <li>With a price like that, it&#x27;s safe to say that this has definitely made it to my personal &#x27;must-have&#x27; beauty list.</li>
      <li>not a bad product it was gentle enough for my sensitive eyelids</li>
      <li>lotion consistency of this remover makes it very easy to simply rub it onto my eyes without tugging, following which, I simply wipe it off with a large cotton pad before going in the shower.</li>
      <li>It is soft and doesn&#x27;t really have a smell but the texture puts me off.</li>
      <li>but now I live alone</li>
      <li>all the black from your liner and mascara comes off clean with no burning of your eyes.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even need that much to remove all of my makeup (and I wear foundation, concealer, powder,eye primer, lash primer, eye shadow, liquid eyeliner {water proof} and mascara - on a daily basis).</li>
      <li>I use to purchase this makeup removed directly from my Avon rep</li>
      <li>i am a big fan of using a remover that is gentle on the eye area</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even use a cotton ball, just massage it gently on my eyelashes and then wash my face with my regular Clinique soap.  </li>
      <li>Not for sensitive eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>she would always buy directly from Avon</li>
      <li>have tried many products in the past, but always go back to this product.</li>
      <li>and there is no other like it!</li>
      <li>so it can be hard to find something that works easily so that I don&#x27;t have to scrub.  </li>
      <li>A few times I&#x27;ve used too much product &amp; a little has gotten into my eye; it doesn&#x27;t hurt, just blurs my vision and has easily been rinsed out w/my saline</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The product really works well to remove your eye makeup (or Halloween face paint) at the end of the day.  However, I prefer something that feels less greasy....this is a remover LOTION, so its made to feel rich, but apparently that is not my preference.</li>
    <li> I used to use this because it was so cheap like 99 cents a bottle. I thought it was gentle but it irritates my eyes and leaves a film that over time causes me to develop blepharitis which I&#x27;ve gotten a few times from these types of cream removers. Now I use jojoba oil and so far so good.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time today and was delighted to find that it removed my waterproof mascara very easily. Truth is, I actually stopped wearing mascara for a while because my previous eye makeup remover just couldn&#x27;t do the job of removing it fully. I&#x27;d be tugging at my lashes (which is a big no-no) only to still find traces of mascara afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion consistency of this remover makes it very easy to simply rub it onto my eyes without tugging, following which, I simply wipe it off with a large cotton pad before going in the shower. I&#x27;m pleased to report that it removed my mascara very quickly with minimal fuss, and I loved the moisturizing effect it had on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I wish I had discovered this little gem much earlier! With a price like that, it&#x27;s safe to say that this has definitely made it to my personal &#x27;must-have&#x27; beauty list.</li>
    <li> Works great for removing mascaras. Seems to moisturize as it removes makeup</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was desperate for an eye makeup remover. I saw that it had great reviews, so I gave it a try. I usually use this in the shower. The product works, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the residue it leaves behind. I use my usual cleanser after using it. I probably won&#x27;t purchase this again after I&#x27;m done using this.</li>
    <li> I have used this for more years then I can remember, and will never use anything else for my makeup remover</li>
    <li> I use to purchase this makeup removed directly from my Avon rep but she is no longer selling Avon. My sister told me it was super cheap on Amazon. I am so happy this is still around, I have used this for many years and have never had an issue with it. It is not greasy and it removes anything. I had to use it on my lips after Halloween and it worked great!</li>
    <li> It does what its suppose to do I just don&#x27;t like the smell! But its a good product for removing makeup and is sensitive for your eyes. I felt like when I used it, it smelled like orange.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product daily and swears by it!  Giving myself a bit of credit as her best friend-this product is her second!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and it&#x27;s amazing. I put the tiniest amount on a Q tip and it takes off eye makeup with no problems. After a shower, it takes off mascara run like it&#x27;s nothing. And the bottle will last forever since you need so little.</li>
    <li> This stuff is my favorite for taking off my eye makeup and it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue like other removers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes &amp; removes eye makeup better than any product I&#x27;ve used regardless of cost! Very inexpensive &amp; excellent results!</li>
    <li> My favorite eye makeup remover. It&#x27;s gentle and not oily like many others!</li>
    <li> It took off my makeup but the smell is so strong that I can&#x27;t help but feel like I&#x27;m rubbing pure plastic/chemicals on my eyelids. I used it once and will not use it again.</li>
    <li> I use this to gently remove the makeup around my eyes in the morning (no matter how well I clean them at night, I always find more has wept around my eyes by morning). It&#x27;s pretty gentle and works fine if you dab it on a q-tip and run it along your eye-line.</li>
    <li> As wonderful as it always has been. Thank you Avon for being consistent with your products. Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped with my waterproof stuff but for the others, it comes right off with no harsh scrubbing. Use it every day.</li>
    <li> I generally wear waterproof mascara and from the reviews it seemed like people were quite happy with the effectiveness of this eye makeup remover. It takes off a small percentage of the mascara, but also makes my eyes all cloudy at the same time. It seemed to have worked for other people, so maybe it&#x27;s just the brands of mascara that I use.</li>
    <li> This eye makeup remover was okay but I just learned that Avon continues to test cosmetics on animals, which I find morally repugnant. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for more than 10 years. It&#x27;s the best product I have ever used. It doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes and always gets off any waterproof mascara easily.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products in the past, but always go back to this product. I don&#x27;t have an Avon representative, so I am always searching for this product but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> this is only 99 cents on the avon website!!!!! do not buy here on amazon!!! i love this stuff and wont use anything else, but buy this on the avon website because its WAY cheaper. this price is a rip off!!!!</li>
    <li> It really need a lot of product to somewhat remove eye makeup. My dove soap does a better job. It also gave me blurry eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, when I lived with my grandma for a while she would always buy directly from Avon but now I live alone and I&#x27;m an Amazon shopper. The point is I absolutely love this stuff and buy it all the time. It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes or anything it&#x27;s just a perfect eye makeup remover and its a need in my life lol.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best for removing waterproof mascara!  Gentle, easy to use, no problem if you accidentally get it in your eyes!</li>
    <li> This eye makeup remover works like magic.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes and it removes all makeup with a couple of sweeps from a cotton ball or cleansing pad.  I&#x27;ve tried other products with no success so I&#x27;m sticking to Avon!</li>
    <li> The product works great, is very gentle and completely removes my eye makeup.  I would have given it 5 stars but the packaging is horrible.  It&#x27;s a squeeze bottle dispenser and way too much comes out. A little of this stuff goes a long way. Would buy again though.</li>
    <li> Happy with Avon&#x27;s eye make up remover; would purchase this product again. Other eye make up removers do not do the job as well as this product.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for 5 years and it&#x27;s never let me down. Pleased especially with delivery time and safety seal under the cap!</li>
    <li> i am a big fan of using a remover that is gentle on the eye area and this works great for the price. it compares to other products ive used that cost much more. i&#x27;ll be using this from now on.</li>
    <li> I am not a big Avon fan however, I have been using this eye make up remover for years and there is no other like it!</li>
    <li> I had to throw it away. I tried using it a couple times, then would take a break then go back to it again, but something in there doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace Lancôme Bifacils but it didn&#x27;t cut it.  It works okay but stings a bit and clouds up the eye.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye makeup remover... Not greasy and all the black from your liner and mascara comes off clean with no burning of your eyes.  I ordered this and received it within three days even I. The middle of snowstorms... TY amazon</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gentle and not greasy. You only need a small amount, so it lasts a really long time. I love it!</li>
    <li> A small bit of lotion goes a long way. I have used it on eyeliner, eyeshadow, and mascara. It works very well.</li>
    <li> This is the best remover I have ever used. I generally use St. Ives until I tried this.Dear lord it is fantastic. I don&#x27;t even need that much to remove all of my makeup (and I wear foundation, concealer, powder,eye primer, lash primer, eye shadow, liquid eyeliner {water proof} and mascara - on a daily basis). It takes everything off quickly, easily, and smoothly. I will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> It is soft and doesn&#x27;t really have a smell but the texture puts me off. It is thicker than it needs to be and lumpy.</li>
    <li> It does remove eye makeup well.  However, I experienced stinging in my eyes immediately after use.  I ordered Neutrogena Hydrating Eye Makeup Remover Lotion, and it works very well, without irritation.</li>
    <li> Super good product...fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I use it by applying a squeeze to a wet cotton square, using one side to gently wipe off my eye makeup &amp; the other to wipe the product away from my eye.  I prefer to remove my contacts first .. but if I&#x27;m careful (and use a q-tip) can use w/contacts in.  A few times I&#x27;ve used too much product &amp; a little has gotten into my eye; it doesn&#x27;t hurt, just blurs my vision and has easily been rinsed out w/my saline rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found this product works way better for me than the pre-moisted makeup remover pads.  Those are convenient but seem to need rubbing to get all the makeup off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product my eye area feels nice and moist, not sore or harshly dry at all.  (note: I&#x27;m in my 50s so moisture is important to my skin)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, this product leaves a film in &amp; over your eyes, you need a different remover to get it off. Unless you like things blurry...can&#x27;t even imagine if you wore contacts. I didn&#x27;t even want to give to someone else to try. I threw it away. So wasteful n dissapointed</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t seem to get mascara off very well with this but it handles the rest of eye make up great! very gentle</li>
    <li> My favorite eye makeup remover ever. I have tried many over the years, and I always come back to this product. It can take off any type of eye makeup I put on. LOVE!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many kinds of eye makeup remover.  I use waterproof mascara so it can be hard to find something that works easily so that I don&#x27;t have to scrub.  This stuff is gentle, doesn&#x27;t sting or goop-up my eyes, and it works very easily!  I don&#x27;t even use a cotton ball, just massage it gently on my eyelashes and then wash my face with my regular Clinique soap.  No mascara residue!  I have sensitive skin so I have to be careful about eye products, and this product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all - in fact my eyes feel like they&#x27;ve been moisturized after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
    <li> not a bad product it was gentle enough for my sensitive eyelids but I had to use quite a lot  to remove the eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try a new product to remove my mascara, I had been using liquid remover and was looking forward to the lotion. The reviews were great so I assumed I&#x27;d love it, too. I followed the directions and dampened a cotton ball, applied the product, then started &amp;#34;patting&amp;#34; my lashes as instructed... NOTHING CAME OFF! I started rubbing, my lashes started clumping together and the makeup still wasn&#x27;t coming off! I scrubbed, I then use the other &amp;#34;instruction&amp;#34;, rubbing with my finger, nothing. So it was a complete waste, and a total disappointment. At least it was cheap. I wear Maybelline waterproof mascara... guessing by other reviews it works well for other makeups, but for mine.</li>
    <li> Ugh! This stuff is thick, white &amp; creamy, nothing like what you&#x27;d want in close proximity to your eyeballs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in a fog for 20 minutes afterward, and my eyelashes were still full of mascara, but softened and gunky. I can&#x27;t imagine how any gal would say this junk is the BEST they&#x27;ve ever used...maybe they&#x27;re Avon Ladies...</li>
    <li> My sister loves this product. She wears all kinds of eye make up and uses it to perfect it. good stuff</li>
    <li> This product burned my eyes. Not for sensitive eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the liquid eye makeup removers over the cream versions.</li>
    <li> Been using for years, very good product.gentle on skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye makeup remover for many months. (more than one bottle) It lasts long though. It&#x27;s gentle on my eyes. Just use a warm, soft wash cloth, but do be careful not to use too much, a little goes a long way and it does burn a your eyes a little. (by using too much)</li>
