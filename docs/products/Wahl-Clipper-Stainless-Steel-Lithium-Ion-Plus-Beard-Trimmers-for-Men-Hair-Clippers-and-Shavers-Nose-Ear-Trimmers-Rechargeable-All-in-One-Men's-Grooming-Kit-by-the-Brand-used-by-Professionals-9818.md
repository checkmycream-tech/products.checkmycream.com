<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works like a charm, no problems at all. Much nicer and heavier than the &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; ones I&#x27;ve been&lt;br /&gt;buying every other year. Charge lasts much longer than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> Crapped out on me after one year. Bought the same plastic version for half the price and its lasted longer and still going.</li>
    <li> Box had been opened; all items there.  The product has lots of power, well made.  Only downside is that it does get hair all over the place, so use it before you shower in the shower.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really gotten to use it much, but it really is a well made product and blades do the job</li>
    <li> Works good as a beard trimmer, and minor hair trim.</li>
    <li> This thing is the biggest piece of crap. I&#x27;ve bought two of these because the first one broke and the second one hit the floor at Mach 4 after it broke. It stops turning on, the power switch on it sucks.</li>
    <li> I charged this thing once and it is still going a month later...have had none of the power switch problems others talked about.  The attachments are made of a more flexible plastic that doesn&#x27;t snap when dropped or squished a bit in the bag (a BIG problem on my old Remington).  It cuts well for me, never more than 2 passes required, though I often do a third for good measure. It has a solid, quality feel.  It&#x27;s design is sharp, modern and stylish (I care about these things, life is too short to settle for low quality, ugly things you have to use everyday).  Would certainly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Doesnt really have a close to skin alignment</li>
    <li> I will give 5-stars on the battery life and the &amp;#34;heavy-duty&amp;#34; feel of the razor unit (weight, steel casing, motor, options, etc) -- high quality product.  I never used any of the various attachments, so I can&#x27;t comment on those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opted to return my unit, as the shortest facial hair guard (1/16&amp;#34;) would not cut short enough for me -- left facial hair considerably longer than 1/16&amp;#34; (imho).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am replacing a rechargeable Conair unit that I had for 10+ years and used the guard size of &amp;#34;I&amp;#34; (roman numeral 1) -- it cut much shorter than Wahl&#x27;s 1/16&amp;#34; guard.  I just found the Conair GMT/900R unit for $25.49 (major drug store&#x27;s website with 50% personal care weekend sale + 15% off site-wide coupon), which typically sells for $65+/-.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to post this review for those that may be looking for a trimmer for shorter facial hair (&amp;#34;5-o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34; look).</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer and it felt good, but it would not turn off.  Wahl customer service sent me a return label saying that this must have been part of a defective batch.  As I was now without a trimmer I went and bought another cheaper model, but after taking the head off to clean it, failed to  re-install it after two hours of trying.  Have given up on this and decided to return to being clean-shaven.</li>
    <li> The hair clipper tip does not stay in place when you shave.  The accesories are from china not the USA.&lt;br /&gt;I will not use this product again.</li>
    <li> Looks and feels really nice and is wide which is good but am undecided as it does weird thing when I plug it in. No problems trimming my beard and man-scape areas.</li>
    <li> Excellent for my beard trims and hair cuts.</li>
    <li> My old trimmer finally died and it was just a Walmart special over 10 years ago.  I needed to purchase a new one and a better one which is why I chose Wahl.  It is bigger than I expected but it does make it easier to hold on to.  I comes with a lot of attachments which is a plus.  There isn&#x27;t a bag or rack to hold them all so I expect I will find the ones I use the most and make them easy to access.  So far this is a good trimmer.  I haven&#x27;t used it enough to find specifically what I do like and what I don&#x27;t like.  Hey, its a trimmer and its good enough to trim my chin.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Wahl 9818 in February and I have never been as impressed with a beard trimmer as I am with this one. I have worn a beard for 44 years, so I have tried all sorts of trimmers. The Wahl stands out at the top of all the trimmers that I have tried. It is one solid piece of precision shaving equipment. Just pick one up and feel the weight compared to the others. This is stainless steel, rugged and durable, not the cheap plastic crap that we have come to see as the norm.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Stainless Steel&lt;br /&gt;  Cuts great&lt;br /&gt;  Reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;  Plenty of attachments&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None&lt;br /&gt;Wahl has done this one right I will recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ed Lynch</li>
    <li> No razor has touched my face since 1970... I have always bought wahl... without a doubt, this is there finest... very sharp and took a little getting used to... I love it... my doctor is growing a beard and I have purchased one for him... He is 1/2 indian, the cat could lick his wiska&#x27;s off... but what does he know... All my best... Bill</li>
    <li> Picked this up at a low discounted price when I was first experimenting with a beard and didn&#x27;t want to invest in an expensive trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the several things I was warned about in the reviews the main one that has come true for me is the poor quality of the shaver head attachment for use on areas where you don&#x27;t want beard.  It takes many passes to get something approaching a clean shave, with lots of tugging and grabbing. Basically it feels like the blade is dull and even after a lot of work it&#x27;s not a very good shave.  Furthermore the fit became loose after a while and it buzzes very loudly while you use it unless you restrain the vibratino with a finger or thumb while you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it&#x27;s been fine for me; it charges very quickly and holds a charge for a very long time, the other heads work well and it&#x27;s comfortable in the hand.</li>
    <li> Well built.  Feels good in the hands -- smooth texture to the body, weight is balanced.  Excellent battery life.  More attachments than I know what to do with. It operates very well.</li>
    <li> Great for trimming sideburns, and around the ears, Thank You.</li>
    <li> Clipper would not turn off after the second use.  I called customer service after seeing the big &amp;#34;STOP! Do not return this item to place of purchase&amp;#34; flyer and after waiting on hold for 15 minutes they told me to return it to the place of purchase.  I told them they get an &amp;#34;F&amp;#34; at life.  I bought a cheaper walh model and it broke this morning after being used five times.  It will not turn on.</li>
    <li> CHEAP CONSTRUCTION.I BOUGHT BECAUSE IT SAID IT WAS MADE I USA.IT SURE LOOKED LIKE CHEAP OVERSEAS CONSTRUCTION.PLASTIC ACCESSORIES CLEARLY LABELED MADE IN CHINA.I SUSPECT PARTS WERE PUT TOGETHER I USA</li>
    <li> Definately all-in-1.  All the attachments, guides, etc. fit the trimmer well and works.  I like the heavier feel and quick charging features.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!  IT FAILED WITHIN DAYS OF THE 30-DAY RETURN POLICY.  I NOW OWN A $60 PAPERWEIGHT.</li>
    <li> being a hairstylist I am very particular about my tools. this one is one of the best buys I&#x27;ve made in a long time. it charges up lightning fast yet the battery life lasts unbelievably long. in fact, I&#x27;m still on my first charge!&lt;br /&gt;this is a sleek chic sexy machine that gives us stylists the precision we strive for and the clean finish our clients deserve.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this product (on Amazon) and the length of charge was the biggest reason for purchasing. The ease of changing out attachments was surprising. Smartly engineered.</li>
    <li> This item would be a 5 start IF they included or even made a #1 1/2 guide attachment for it. It comes with a #1 (1/8&amp;#34;) and a #2 (1/4&amp;#34;), the 1/8&amp;#34; is really short almost like using no attachment and the 1/4&amp;#34; is way too long and not clean looking. They really need to offer a 3/16&amp;#34; attachment. On their website they claim it comes with a 3/16&amp;#34; and IT DOESNT!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the exterior fool you, this is a cheap, plastic, poorly assembled piece of garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting a tiny bit of water on the switch assembly (as is likely to happen when using any shaver), the clipper would not turn off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to disassemble it completely and soak the switch assembly in 99% ISO alcohol, repeatedly pressing it and blowing it out with compressed air, until it finally started responding again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The outside is stainless steel but the entire assembly is plastic, including the mounts for the tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this - it&#x27;s a load of features packed into a disposable, faulty gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be looking for a replacement that can handle the moist environment of a bathroom without failing.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works perfect does everything I need and more</li>
    <li> I have a fairly heavy beard and have a hard time trimming it. When I bought this I was a little worried it wouldn&#x27;t have the power necessary to power through the tangles. That said I was pleasantly surprised when I went to use it. It demolished the tangles and breezed right through the hair I have. The small trimming pieces that came came with it made edging and shaping a breeze as well.</li>
    <li> This clipper is Grate, Very nice to use and does a very good job.I have had a other clippers but this the best by far. I love it!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> beautiful made and fit.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a well built beard trimmer for the last few months, and I came across this one and love it.  It is built very well and cuts very precisely.  I ordered this product on a Monday and it was at my door by Wednesday, I love these guys.</li>
    <li> Blade guides are still cheap made in china plastic, one broken already</li>
    <li> Great groomer.  Easy to use.  so Far so good</li>
    <li> Half year later the power doesn&#x27;t work, but I have to order this one again because hubby love it.. I offer him a different one but he prefer this one :p</li>
    <li> Trims great, attachments fit well. Problem is that the button issue hasnt been fixed. I thought to myself maybe by now they had fixed it but no. Less than 2 weeks old and its stuck on. Back to the store it goes. Guess im going with another brand.    Update, 2nd unit from another store. Dead in 7 days and 3 uses. Stuck on. Bringing it back this weekend. Looks like im leaving wahl since they make such trash.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer. The charge seems to last forever. The operation is very smothe and I have not been nicked yet. The guards work much better my last trimmer. This will be a long term keeper .</li>
    <li> Quality is excellent except combs and the S.S blades. It fits perfect in hand and you can do whatever you want precisely. It is a good choice for men&#x27;s grooming.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my son and to replace an old Wahl rechargeable pro trimmer #8900 purchased in 1993.  He likes it, says it works well and looks good too. [[ASIN:B0058SY1XQ Wahl 9818 Lithium Ion Stainless Steel All-in-one Groomer]]</li>
    <li> Stainless steel is the best material to be used for this product. I had the plastic version previously, and they eventually failed.</li>
    <li> This razor started to short within 4 months of owning it and all out died within 6 months...Garbage</li>
    <li> Was a great beard/body trimmer but stopped charging properly a couple months after the one year warranty was up.  It eventually stopped taking a charge altogether and we never did find out the cost of repair because the Service centre we took it to couldn&#x27;t even get a response from their Wahl representative. I expected better for the price of this shaver ($80 in Canada).</li>
    <li> UPDATE - DECEMBER 2015  -  After my review update of April, this trimmer went downhill decisively, and yet maddingly random and sporadic.  Frankly it&#x27;s been driving me nuts for 8 months.  I have been SO busy with other things that addressing this faulty trimmer had not been at the top of my list, so continued to make me CRAZY.  When I plug the charger cord into the trmmer, pushing the plug all the way in DOES NOT solve the problem as it seemed to briefly.  The LED was flashing randomly with the charger plugged in, more or less corresponing to wiggling it, SOMETIMES, the LED would not light at all -- seeming to indicate the plug is not making contact and it&#x27;s not charging.  THEN, WHEN I REMOVED THE CHARGER PLUG, THE TRIMMER TURNED ON!  Truly bizarre.  Never has it just charged normally when I plugged it in.  Also, several times when I plugged the charger plug in, the trimmer it went on!  It would appear that the electronic control cirucuit on these trimmers are defective (many other reviews showing similar symptoms).  This is going from 4 stars to one, and I will contact Wahl&#x27;s customer service to see what happens.  I see from reviews that some customers received a replacement which also had the same problem.  Clearly I was overly hasty to give this product a good review, given the downhill experience since I bought and reviewed it.  (Don&#x27;t review this kind of product so soon after you buy it.)  (PREVIOUS) UPDATE - APRIL 2015 - When I plugged the charging cord into the shaver, the light indicating that it charging was flickering randomly and I discovered that the &amp;quot;charging&amp;quot; indicator light when on and off when moving the plug and socket where it plugs into the shaver --- seeming to mean that there&#x27;s a bad connection inside the socket inside the clipper body.  I was planning on calling the company and returning it, but didn&#x27;t get around to it.  HOWEVER, I THEN REALIZED THAT I WASN&#x27;T PUSHING THE PLUG ALL THE WAY INTO THE SOCKET.  APPARENTLY YOU MUST PUSH IT IN WITH SOME FORCE, UNTIL IT CLICKS INTO PLACE.  After I discovered that and was careful to push it in hard all the way it seemed to be OK.  I&#x27;ve been otherwise happy with it, because it gets the job done.  However another minor complaint is that the design of the body isn&#x27;t very ergonomically efficeint --- the designer probably didn&#x27;t use a focus group, etc.  It is a simple, univorm very smooth (slipery) shape, and since it&#x27;s exactly the same on all sides, you cannot tell by feel which side is which.  Assuming I&#x27;ll keep this and not return it, I&#x27;m likely to cover the body, possibly with that mesh rubber shelf liner stuf that has a strong gripping friction.  This will allow a more secure grip on the clipper.  (End of April 2015 update)  Original reveiw:  This is well worth the additional cost.  I have power tools and know well the benefits of lithium-ion battery power.  (Good lithium-ion power tools are expensive, but one truly doesn&#x27;t regret having paid it, very much worth the cost --- tons of power for the weight and very durable.)  I bought this to replace a rechargeable Wahl that had  a special rechargeable Ni-cad battery, and it seemed to cut in and out (fast, slow fast slow) very irritating,  I tried everything possible to fix it, and nothing worked.  It seemed like a junk toy that way.  To be fair, I didn&#x27;t oil the cutter regularly, which maybe many users fail to do, and possibly may have made some difference.  I&#x27;m going to try to lube this one regularly with mineral oil, available inexpensively from any drugstore.  This kind of clipper should be lubed on a regular baisis.  In summary, it seems surprising that any company sells such junk and at the same time also sells the very best available quality products, which this clipper clearly is.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer. Weighty in the hand (owing to being all metal construction), trimmer heads exchange easily and the travel plug is very useful (prevents the trimmer from accidentally turning on). Battery life appears to be quite good and it behaves as a lithium-ion battery should (little dropoff in power prior to completely running down).</li>
    <li> great to use, lots of features and great battery life</li>
    <li> High quality product!  I just wish it had a greater selection of the smaller sized guards for greater precision.</li>
    <li> Perfect for trimming up after my haircut&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge for weeks&lt;br /&gt;Sleek design</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> Did not charge correctly and pulled at hairs during use.</li>
    <li> This is one very nice groomer - true salon quality.  I&#x27;ve had quite a few Wahl products and this one makes all the others seem like throwaway junk.  Truly a nice groomer.</li>
    <li> Nice solid feel and very fast ....I use mine daily and it&#x27;s the best clipper/ trimmer&lt;br /&gt;That I have bought and recommend it&lt;br /&gt;to all my friends</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed. Pulled hair REPEATEDLY when trying to shave. DONT PURCHASE!!</li>
    <li> It came broken had to send it back.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t have a true stubble option.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice clipper. Excellent quality. Lots of attachments come in the package. One charge is good for at least a week for me. Excellent for traveling. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I spent hours shopping for a nice shaver. This one worked pretty well with the old-fashion guards. I didn&#x27;t have to make as many passes to get my beard even. It&#x27;s a heavy weight and feels solid. It feels expensive with the exception of the charging port. The guards also don&#x27;t fit properly in the blade. They kind of bend around the base a little bit, the short guards that is. The power button did feel a little finicky and I saw reviews where people said it wouldn&#x27;t turn off or would randomly turn back on after switching it off. Well I plugged mine in after using it and when I unplugged it, it turned itself on and now it won&#x27;t turn off. I&#x27;m just letting it run until the batteries are dead. I&#x27;ve tried repeatedly to turn it off and it just won&#x27;t. Where can I get a nice trimmer like this one? I don&#x27;t care about price I just want something nice. I feel like it doesn&#x27;t exist. I will definitely return it. Pathetic.</li>
    <li> I chose this product to replace an &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34; set bought at a department store whose rechargeable battery had grown too old to hold a charge more than a very few minutes. I researched on-line, but knew the Wahl brand as that used by every hair professional that I&#x27;ve seen. This model is sleek, high quality and has the convenience of interchangeable cutting heads to suit my limited needs. The accessories and device store easily in the included zippered case. I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple of months but immediately appreciated the superior cutting blades. I am hoping it lasts, have no reason to expect otherwise. Only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; I have encountered is the on-off switch, which takes just the right angle and pressure to respond; it always takes me a couple of tries to turn it on. Another potential &#x27;con&#x27; is the unchangeable rechargeable battery, but we shall have to wait and see how it lasts.</li>
    <li> This trimmer hasn&#x27;t been charged since we got it. I don&#x27;t use it daily however once a week and still holding charge while providing a good cut that&#x27;s pretty good in my book.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad unit but this thing is terrible. I threw away my old plastic Norelco once I got the Wahl and I wish I hadn&#x27;t done that. This trimmer cannot go half an inch with painfully pulling hair. It seems to charge just fine but it always sounds like it&#x27;s about to die. I&#x27;ve cleaned and oiled the blade and it still works terribly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money. My old trimmers looked and felt cheap, but at least they did what they said they would. The Wahl looks and feels great but this thing has been nothing but trouble.</li>
    <li> Just awful. I bought this since it did both trimming and shaving, and I wouldn&#x27;t need to buy two separate products. Well it does neither well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer constantly pulls on the hairs on my neck when using the t-blade, forcing me to go extremely slow with it, and even then, it will still pull on the occasional hair. Also, when using the shaver, it never gets a close shave. Not even remotely close. My ten year old Braun worked great and would give me an excellent shave, but the tiny shaver head on this trimmer doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything. I can shave the same spot over and over and it never cuts the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, not being able to use it while charging is a let down. I get that it has a 1-minute quick charge capability (to get 3 minutes of use out of), but I&#x27;d rather just plug it in and use it for as long as I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lack of a stand/cradle for the whole thing makes keeping it on my counter a big mess. I keep the travel bag on the counter just so there isn&#x27;t pieces all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using it for about two weeks, but I can see where other reviewers were saying they were having issues with the power button. It seems to be a capacitive button rather than an actual toggle button, so it will eventually stop responding to the touch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these. One for myself, and one for my father, because I liked the first one so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last shaver I owned (Norelco body groomer) was nice because it was durable, but it wasn&#x27;t very powerful or sharp. This shaver had very sharp blades and a powerful motor which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after trying to clean the shave head, I got a very small amount of water inside of the unit from the top (where the blade is removed) and immediately the thing wouldn&#x27;t turn off. It hasn&#x27;t charged properly since, and the blades are starting to rust. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but the charging port breaks almost immediately. This renders it completely worthless. Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> This shaver/trimmer is the best thing ever. Was using a Panasonic before, this one is like a Ferrari. Solid, powerful, way better shave. Comes with all sorts of attachments including nose-hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 33, nearly always have some level of facial hair and keep it trimmed weekly if not every 3-4 days. Had the same exact problem as many other reviews the 2nd time using this trimmer. As I type, the trimmer is sitting on my desk, the plug in (not plugged into wall) because it will not turn off without inserting the charging cable. I will add that if your hands are even slightly wet this trimmer is just waiting to slip and smash something with it&#x27;s beautiful stainless steal quality. Sadly, I wish I could love this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Purchased December 27, 2013. I just use it to trim my face about ever 4 days or so. It&#x27;s been great, but now the power button is unresponsive and will not turn off. So I got just under a year and 6 months out of this. Garbage.</li>
    <li> Update...3rd one stopped working. Won&#x27;t charge - won&#x27;t turn on, same thing as 1st two I bought. I am moving to different manufacturer - probably Andis as these Wahls are not well made.   This is an update from my favorable review...I have been through 2 of these but it is still the only shaver to get low enough so will buy a third...cheaply made, the problem seems to be where the charger connects...it wears out or something over time and loses its ability to charge.  Best clipper available for a bald person...can get it right down to the scalp but I didn&#x27;t want the kojak look...This gets it perfectly low. Only issue is the first one I bought the clipper got out of whack and I could not fix. Can go weeks without a charge. Great clipper for its purpose, none of the others can get this low.</li>
    <li> This is a nice powerful clipper. I used a cheaper model very similar to this with a rubbery exterior coating but bought this one because I lost one of the medium sized clipper attachments and wanted an upgrade anyway. This one looks nicer sitting on the counter and I&#x27;m happy I bought it. But I will say that it is slightly more difficult to grip and it comes with a medium sized foil attachment instead of the medium sized clipper, which I personally do not find as useful. I do find this trimmer indispensable though; I might just consider the rubber coated one if aesthetics are not your primary concern.</li>
    <li> So far this trimmer has been really good. It is easy to switch cutting heads to complete your trim.</li>
    <li> Very nice and classy shaver.  Looks very nice, masculine, and feels solid in the hand.</li>
    <li> Nice travel shaver if you&#x27;re going to away for a week or so.  However this puppy just isn&#x27;t powerful enough to handle a tough shave.  I would recommend have a PRIMARY shaver at home and use this just a travel shaver.</li>
    <li> Works well, but one of the combs broke, the first time I put it on the razor.  In 3 months the battery stopped charging to its full capacity.  Then the charging pin would not come out and now it no longer works.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is a good buy.  It is sharp, accurate and runs many hours on a single charge.  I like all of the attachments that come with it.  To those that complain about it I would say that you folks would complain about the color green on free money.</li>
    <li> Wahl has bucked the race to the bottom trend of cheap plastic toys disguised as trimmers with the release of the 9818. The first thing that sets this trimmer apart from the others, is the quality of workmanship.  This American made, yes - American made trimmer , has a solid, stainless steel body that feels heavy, in a good way. Unlike the Wahl &amp;#34;All-In-One Lithium Ion&amp;#34; model&#x27;s blades, the 9818 blades are made of stainless steel - keeping them rust resistant.   The shaver attachment is now a single, thinner foil, reducing potential blind spots, making it more accurate for lining and tapering. The motor is relatively quiet, yet consistently powered.  For the holder, Wahl has replaced the impractical, all-inclusive blade and shaver rack stand with a singular, molded, piece of frosted plastic for a base - which has the exclusivity of a plastic water bottle but - IT WORKS, as I actually use it. The shaver fits snugly, and takes up little space near the sink, without the clutter.  Now for some of the drawbacks:  The shaver cannot be used while charging - not a big deal as the led light flashes when the battery is low, there is a &amp;#34;quick charge&amp;#34;, and the battery, when fully charged - lasts relatively long.  The t-blade (especially on the newer models) aren&#x27;t sharp enough to give you that clean type beard and moustache lining you get from a barbershop type trimmer, without multiple attempts. The attachable blade guides could have been more precise for stubble and shorter lengths.  Overall - still a good effort by Wahl. Hopefully, it will send a message that amid the sea of mediocrity in men&#x27;s trimmers, many men will spend a few dollars more for a well designed and better made trimmer.</li>
    <li> Fantastic professional feeling product. Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> This tool is awesome!</li>
    <li> Awesome cordless trimmer.  Holds the charge for long enough and cuts well.</li>
    <li> Item was broken and used when it arrived. The trimmer head had beard hair in it. I was disappointed and disgusted.</li>
    <li> This trimmer has a solid construction for sure. The problem, i find, lies within the guides. The 8 guides that come with it in different sizes to cut hair are somewhat flimsy. I feel they will break easily and probably before anything goes wrong with the trimmer hence the reason for the 4 stars. I have only had the trimmer for a a couple days and it is nice because it has a ear/nose hair trimmer with a detailer and hair cutter in it. I love the solid steel construction which makes it sleek.&lt;br /&gt;Another problem i have had is that i find i have to hit the power button several times before the trimmer actually turns off. This doesn&#x27;t happen every time i hit the power button but it has happened several times.&lt;br /&gt;Another sort of annoyance is that the trimmer does not run when plugged in. It has to be charged to run. One of the things i have found useful in other trimmers is when the battery runs out i can plug it in and use it but this is not the case with this trimmer. There is an indicator LED light to let you know battery life which can be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5/31/12&lt;br /&gt;The blade has started to show signs of rust. It is still useable but it is rusting which is not cool. Yes i oil it and stuff but sometimes ill use it in the shower and maybe this is the reason it rusts. i dont wipe the blade down after i use it. The only time water hits it really is when i wash it off after i use it to clean away the hair.&lt;br /&gt;The largest guide which is a No. 8, doesnt fit the clippers well at all. It doesnt snap into place. it is still useable but just have to be careful otherwise it falls off.&lt;br /&gt;The battery still lasts a long time which is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6/14/12&lt;br /&gt;Ok, the trimmer blade is more rusted then before. It really sucks. I am thinking i will have to purchase another trimmer with a ceramic under blade. The rusted blade on this thing sticks together now so now i have to push the blade with my finger to get it going. The positive is the body of the trimmer is in great condition, still looks brand new. the battery still lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 7/22/13&lt;br /&gt;The power button fell off rendering the entire thing useless. well built trimmer aside frome the plastic guides, and power button. if the unit is sturdy but the supporting pieces aren&#x27;t, its still not the best.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Great quality and very versatile use.  I&#x27;ve purchased two of these, one for myself and one for my Son.</li>
    <li> The charge on this bad boy lasts forever. Excellent and durable trimmer. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that it&#x27;s easy on the eyes either. All in all, a great product that is probably top 3 for versatile personal trimmers.</li>
    <li> This clipper is great. It is well made and sturdy. The blades are very easy to take on and off. Plus it is just a very nice looking product.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!  I read some reviews on the Wahl website after I bought this unit at Wahlgreens and saw a common problem where you could not shut the power off.  I used my device twice a week for 2 months and then just like many reviews said, the power button failed and the unit would not shut off until the battery died.  I just went to the Wahl website today (2/9/15) and saw this product is NOT available for sale anymore.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and twice cheaper than in Australia</li>
    <li> This works just perfectly. I get a smooth trim. The nose clipper actually works. It feels solid. The on-off button is a bit hard to hit exactly.</li>
    <li> Great for general trimming, not so good for hair cuts.</li>
    <li> Works okay, but seemed to clog too easily. Using the clippers to buzz my head, I thought I had gotten a clean cut until I looked in the mirror. There were tracks of uncut hair (something you&#x27;d see in a horror movie). The clippers, using a #3 guide appeared to have clogged. Knowing that, I will clear it more frequently during the cut, or cut my hair more often. I have another Wahl, just meant for shaving, that did a better job at cutting hair.&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat disappointed, but kind of does the job. Probably would not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is good though.</li>
    <li> Love everything but a little red travel plug to keep in from coming in by mistake is a real pain</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver. Great because of metal construction. Worth the extra price. Also charge lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This will be the last Wahl product that I ever buy.  The trimmer looks really nice and seems to be built very solid.  Unfortunately there are MAJOR problems with this product.  The power switch is EXTREMELY difficult to use and many have reported that it gets stuck in the on position.  The problem I have with it is due to a heavy beard I&#x27;ve dulled the blade and can&#x27;t find a replacement.  I&#x27;ve looked EVERYWHERE including the Wahl website.  It&#x27;s listed on the Wahl site,  but they won&#x27;t sell it to you?  My advice is don&#x27;t buy this or any Wahl product.  Unfortunately this is about the 4th bad experience I&#x27;ve had with Wahl... Stupid me.  Never again.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t read the 5 star reviews because with limited time I am trying to cover the bases. In any case, for those who want further detail, this trimmer is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;1. It doesn&#x27;t catch hairs.&lt;br /&gt;2. Has the right amount of power.&lt;br /&gt;3. Charge holds.&lt;br /&gt;4. Has a cool attachment that I would categorize as something between a shaver and a trimmer which allows for a very close trim without the rash (for those who have sensitive skin) causing close-shave sensation.&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday as a substitute for shaving (combination of trimming and using the attachment mentioned in bullet point 4) and I don&#x27;t feel grungy leaving the home. :)</li>
    <li> This shaver has a quality attachments and is built to last. The options for grooming seem endless. I took the shaver on a week trip without the charger and the battery was still going at the end.   The only real problem I&#x27;ve had with it was once after rinsing it in the sink while shaving It would not turn off. The simple on/off push button must have gotten water in the terminals, and it took 5 min of shaking and pushing to turn it off. The design has easy to pop off shaving heads, but, that allows for water to reach the terminals easily.  This only happened once, just be aware of it.</li>
    <li> So far, it holds a charge which was a major issue with my old trimmer. The attachments are easy to use and it has a good solid feel in your hand.</li>
    <li> I like the razor and the design but there&#x27;s problems with their on &amp; off switch. Used it the other day and it would not shut, but after a while I tried it again and it shut off. May be sending the unit back</li>
    <li> I purchased this from Amazon in March 2013.  By March 2015, the battery seems to have become completely incapable of taking or holding a charge.  The clipper runs erratically and is not reliable.  Fortunately, Wahl covers this under a 5 year warranty.  This product will be going back to Wahl for repair or replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may just be due to the fact that battery-powered clippers are not as powerful or reliable as AC powered models.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 2 years and still works well.  It cuts close and I use this instead of shaving.  I travel frequently and the battery is good enough that I don&#x27;t travel with the charger for trips of about three weeks. The charger is universal 110/220 volt.&lt;br /&gt;It is is well made, it feels solid and the stainless steel exterior has survived many trips/drops, the blades are very sharp and the motor is very quiet.  I went through many different trimmers before I found this - I&#x27;ll buy another when it finally dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 27 Nov 14:  During the third year of ownership the battery charge plug in the base of the shaver began intermittently loosing it&#x27;s connection and eventually failed.  I called WAHL - they told me \\&quot;no problem\\&quot; ship it back and it will be repaired under their 5 year warranty.  The rep also said that the blades would be sharpened and all functions checked.  I had recently dropped the trimmer damaging a few teeth so, per the rep&#x27;s instructions, I included a note asking that they call me when it was being serviced so I could provide credit card info to pay for a new blade set ($7.95 -- shipping would have been $12.95 -- figured I would have them attach blades and send it with their free warranty return shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, blade info from WAHL for model 9818:  our t blade (wide) is part number 59302.  If you need the standard (narrow) blade, this is part number 59300-800.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update review after shaver is back from service.</li>
    <li> Clipper is very handy to hold and convenient to use. Has many different heads that easily are removed or installed for different length cuts and trimming.  Battery holds a charge for a long time and recharges very quickly</li>
    <li> I am the trimmer of my partner&#x27;s beard and this is by far the best trimmer I have used in the past 7 years. It&#x27;s smooth, you don&#x27;t have to go over the same area multiple times. It&#x27;s easy to clean. Best of all, it gives a very even overall trim. I&#x27;m not sure what I was thinking buying those cheap trimmers before. Lots of guard lengths. Nose hair trimmer is nice, too. He says it doesn&#x27;t pull and is comfortable. I&#x27;m really happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Good battery life. Need to redesign the body how to hold it comfortably! Need rubber on the body to avoid vibrating in your palm!</li>
    <li> Perfect for traveling and battery life is really good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been very happy with this pair of clippers and the motor is nice and powerful.</li>
    <li> Shaves my beard nicely &amp; has some nice attachments but the stand sucks.</li>
    <li> Not the least expensive, but it is all that they state it to  be.  The best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used, Bar none!</li>
    <li> Great product, thank you!</li>
    <li> Excellent, great value.</li>
    <li> best one i&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. We&#x27;ll worth the money.  It will last forever.  Substantial feel,  holds a charge for a long time,  and just speaks quality and precision</li>
    <li> Great looking update to my old, trusted Wahl trimmer.  Wahl also didn&#x27;t overlap the accessories, guides or trimming heads between the two models.  Now I have the full range that are all usable on the 9818.</li>
    <li> This trimmer worked nicely for a while, but as soon as it came in contact with a drop of moisture, it would either continuously run without being able to shutoff, or it would stay off without being able to turn on.  It is clearly a pushbutton switch design flaw.  Try it for yourself, have a hot steamy shower and let the steam creep into the cheap chinese circuitry.  The latest problem with this trimmer is that it would not turn off at all.  I had to literally disassemble it and cut the battery leads with scissors before I could throw the thing in the trash - where it belongs.</li>
    <li> these are awesome clippers... solid ... good weight ... and trip evenly and no hair pulling... nice and small for a mans short hair cut and trim up or for beards ... i love this product</li>
    <li> Good buy for the money.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy it first because of the price. after I got it I realized how good the quality was I never had problems as other people stated in their reviews I only get 4 stars because I feel as if it doesn&#x27;t get as close of a buzz as my old BuzzerI love all the attachments it comes with awesome</li>
    <li> Güzel makine ama henüz kullanmadi.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sons father who can never find an electric razor he likes. I told him about this &amp; he looked it up on YouTube and saw it was in the top 10 of best razors list so I grabbed it. He loves it! The only thing he&#x27;s getting used to is each blade is a different cut like rather then being able to just switch it to 1 inch or 2 inch w/ the flip of a switch you have to change the blade for each setting. However it&#x27;s a great cut &amp; comes w/ so much. Battery lasts a long time &amp; charges quickly. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I am an African-American male with course hair. I shave my head and face.  This product shaves so close my skin tingled! May not have to shave everyday now. The shaver is solid built and ergonomically. The attachments pop-on and pop-off easily.  May be my last shaver. Thanx Amazon for pricing it right.</li>
    <li> Amazing.......&lt;br /&gt;For this price&lt;br /&gt;The best you can get</li>
    <li> For nearly double the price of an average facial trimmer these days, I suggest investing elsewhere. The main issue I have found with this trimmer is that it does not posses the necessary power to trim a thick beard such a mine, even in its very beginning stages. With a full charge, it still gets caught in my short facial hair as I slowly pass through it. I highly recommend looking for another trimmer!</li>
    <li> Looks very nice and when you take it out of the box it&#x27;s heavy and looks cool BUT not powerfull at all. Almost pulls the hair out of my beard when I wanted to cut it. Does come with tons of attachments but won&#x27;t ever use them cause it just struggles with the most important reason I bought it in the first place, and returned it very shortly after, struggles to cut!</li>
    <li> I bought this about 6 months ago at my local Walmart after doing some research. I was aware of the button and battery issues but I got it anyway. Immediately after receiving it the button was already wonky. It would stay on no matter what. The only way to turn it off was by plugging the travel plug in. I didn&#x27;t really mind because it was still usable. And it worked great when it worked. About 4 months later it would always be dead. Plug it in to charge and now all of a sudden it doesn&#x27;t want to charge. You have to get the cord at a certain angle. After a month of that nonsense the battery just gave out completely.  It&#x27;s great when it works but it&#x27;s a gamble.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use right out of the box.</li>
    <li> Not a short enough cut on a tight beard.&lt;br /&gt;Plastics guard points are too sharp and poky on your face parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too Easy to drop with no contour or grip handle.</li>
    <li> Great all-in-one trimmer. The guards look a little flimsy but so far so good. Excellent battery life. Very pleased overall.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;1. Charging length of time. I still have not had to charge it&lt;br /&gt;2. Easy of changing attachments&lt;br /&gt;3. Number of attachments&lt;br /&gt;4. Oil, comb, brush included&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1. Wish the shave was closer&lt;br /&gt;2. Does not include a stand</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sure if I received a defected product, but the trimmer blade for haircuts scratched my neck.  One tiny part of the blade is a little longer than the rest of the tiny blades which causes the scratching.  If you are like me and don&#x27;t mind just changing the trimmer heads when cleaning up your neck, then this will not be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than this small issue, everything is good quality.  The battery lasts long and I like the aluminum body of the trimmer.  It keeps it very cool which is good for those who will use this to trim their body hair (ie chest, legs, arms, etc) which often takes time to complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the $20 Remington trimmer I had before, this is a big step up.  This only pulls 1 to 2 hairs when I trim my beard, compared to the Remington which would put 8 to 10 hairs (which hurts by the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried other expensive trimmers, but I would recommend this if you are looking for a quality groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit (8/20/2012):&lt;br /&gt;I had to give this one star less because the hair cutting portion of this trimmer pulls my hair out every time I try to use it for cutting my hair on my head; and I do frequently oil it.  I don&#x27;t use this for haircuts anymore. But for trimming hair neck down and beards it is still good.</li>
    <li> Finally finally finally a trimmer worth its weight.  And yes it&#x27;s got some weight and strength to it.  Ya actually feel like this would be what the barber uses.  Buy it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  This isn&#x27;t some dinky dink plastic piece of junk.  Only thing that could&#x27;ve been better was the plastic station holder.  Kind of junky.  But the important part (the shaver) they got right!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Wahl user, repeat customer, and product believer for years.  Sure, other companies make competing products, but only Wahl continues to do it right, the way they&#x27;ve always done it.  With Wahl, their precision ground blades are unmatched when compared with competitors.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands and they just don&#x27;t seem to cut as close.  Spacing between blade teeth is farther away and, well, just not very accurate when you look. The competitor&#x27;s packages look nice, but all one gets is another disposable product in the end.  The products work for a while when given the chance, but the following year, it&#x27;s time to buy a new one.  Why keep adding to your local landfill?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a corded Wahl for so long that I thought my trimmer was reaching the end of its useful life.  It still cuts, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but not like it used to.  Sure, I could purchase some replacement blades, but I really wanted an excuse to buy a new trimmer.  Plus, my trimmer blades don&#x27;t operate as fast as new when moving back and forth.  And yes, I use oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, I was so excited to find that Wahl was making a stainless lithium ion version!  Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t go for a rechargeable trimmer because they just don&#x27;t perform like a corded version, not to mention, rechargeable products only take so many charges over their lifetime and then they become disposable.  Furthermore, they take forever to charge and just don&#x27;t seem to last very long on a charge.  With the invention of lithium ion batteries, this just isn&#x27;t the case, anymore.  Not only is lithium ion capable of hundreds of charges more, but it doesn&#x27;t take long to reach a full charge and lasts way longer when charged.  Discharging when idle doesn&#x27;t happen as quickly either.  What&#x27;s not to like about that?  It&#x27;s almost a no brainer.  Almost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I purchased a Wahl Lithium Ion+.  Before I even used it, I came here and read some reviews to see what others had to say.  I didn&#x27;t want to believe the bad reviews.  Heck, even the most perfect product will have some naysayers, right?  On the other hand, there were so many positive reviews.  Enough to seem to give the product an overwhelmingly good average.  Surely, all those positive reviews couldn&#x27;t be wrong.  Enough, I thought, I just need to try it out myself...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can imagine my disappointment when I encountered problems charging the trimmer unit right off the bat.  Bad first impression.  Seems the plug on the cord at the trimmer end doesn&#x27;t really make a positive connection with the single pin at the bottom of the trimmer.  You shove it in there, but then when you go to lay it down on your counter, this connection slips and there goes your power and the blue indicator light goes out.  I shoved it back in hoping I missed the click lock, but there isn&#x27;t one.  Are you kidding?  For this kind of money Wahl cannot come up with a better connection than that?!  Even modern radar detector connectors found a way to overcome this faulty, failure of a single pin connection.  Come on!!!  I manage to maintain a connection and get it to charge for a few moments so that I can try it out.  I didn&#x27;t find it noisy, as others mentioned.  In fact, it was kind of quiet.  The weight felt good in my hand and it seemed to trim like past Wahl products.  I go to plug it back in, as it wasn&#x27;t fully charged and then I find myself having to shove the power adapter into the bottom forcefully again to make sure it has a connection.  This is when I became fed up.  I boxed it back up and returned it the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would really steer clear of this until Wahl makes some necessary improvements.  Hopefully, one such improvement is with the charger interface.  Until then, I might have to check out a Braun.</li>
    <li> Got this trimmer about 4 months ago to replace a cheap Walmart bought Remington trimmer ($15 and 10 yrs old), battery was going bad. Normally all I used the Remington for was trimming my facial, stomach and chest, and below. I wanted to accomplish the same with this Wahl trimmer but it failed miserably.  I used the #1- 1/16 guard to trim stomach and chest hair and below. I use the blade to trim my facial hair w/o an attachment (keep the short stubble look). This is how I did it with the cheap Remington. My first experience was terrible! The blade would catch and pull hairs when using on my face and neck without an attachment causing pain and blood! With the attachment #1, I would have to go over the same spot multiple times to get it to cut all the hairs to length (when I think I am finished I always find stragglers). The trimmer is difficult to remove hair from the blades (I can&#x27;t just tap it on the edge of the sink like I did with the Remington without the fear of something breaking). Lastly, its impossible to get around nostrils, belly button, and other fine tune areas with the attachments on and without them I am in constant fear of hurting myself.  CONS: Dangerous without the attachments on the face and neck and other areas, slow and ineffective with the attachments for body hair trimming and trimming in tight spots, expensive. PROS: Sleek design and nice traveling case  I have only used this trimmer for the above mentioned areas. Anything beyond that I cannot speak on. My recommendation is to go with a cheaper, plastic model. I&#x27;m going back to Remington for face and body hair trimmer. Wahl needs to stick to only hair cutting tools.</li>
    <li> I love this Wahl clipper.  Very solid construction, with many usuable accessories.  My previous clipper have the battery slowly loose its ability to hold a charge, so I was very concerned about this happening again.  I have had this for several months, and have only charged it once.  I use it maybe once a week for trimming, charge seems strong and cuts real well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still working on figuring out if I need some of the accessories, but time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically I try not to give five stars, because that indicates no further improvement required.  I am cheating slightly, and gave it an additional star for being Made in the USA.  Thats still counts in my book.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome. Get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a T-blade hair cutter, it cuts extremely fast and clean, unlike my old Remington which needed several passes to get all the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a trimmer, it doesn&#x27;t snag, and again, cuts very competently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nose/ear hair trimmer works beautifully, doesn&#x27;t snag and while noisy in the ear, runs smooth after some oiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I&#x27;m not using it right; the detail shaver is the only thing that doesn&#x27;t cut close enough to be used as a shaver. Still need the old razor for a clean shave, but should I ever go for a shave that&#x27;s less than military grade, it will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The number of attachments are sufficient to do anything. They come on and off easily--and don&#x27;t collect much dirt/hairs. I was surprised how easy it was to keep the attachments clean. The attachments are stable and mounts solidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stainless steel handle feels very quality, balanced feel in the hand. Also keeps clean with a simple wipe of the thumb. The reviewer having problems with the power button: the trick is to let go of the switch completely after turning it on, before turning it off again. The switch does not \\&quot;double-tap\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer how this entire package simplifies and down-sizes the groomer system: I appreciate that the charger is as small as possible, with no wasted plastic stand. For travel, this entire system fits in a - as far as I know - the smallest package of any competitors. Using a trimmer without a cord is a superior experience, and will hopefully put many more barber shops out of business!</li>
    <li> Quite nice, professional grade trimmers.  It even looks really sleek.  Easy to clean and use, and comes with more attachments than I really need, but it&#x27;s nice to have anyway.</li>
    <li> Works great, let&#x27;s see if it&#x27;ll hold up over time</li>
    <li> On and off switch could be better, other then that I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as smoothly as I thought it would, but great product nonetheless</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver, works very well overal but has one huge flaw that makes this thing temporary and a waist of money. The flaw is this, charge this device, you have to plug a cord into the bottom. Over time4-7 months of daily use my plugs just stopped working. Thought the daily us it just wore out. I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> After some heavy duty hinting, I received the Wahl 9818 Trimmer as a Father’s Day gift. Right out of the box, and after a full charge, the trimmer worked flawlessly. The kit includes every possible attachment for the trimming of every hair on the body – head, beard, ear, nose, and even the unmentionable areas. I’ve used it now for more than a week and have not needed to recharge it. I&#x27;ve found no problems with the power button after turning it off an on many times. So I’m very pleased with this trimmer. But after reading several scary negative reviews, I wondered why I haven’t found similar problems with the same trimmer. I’m just hoping that the trimmer production has been upgraded and improved to the extent that this model is now worthy of the 5-star rating I’m giving it. I will, however, update my rating if any electronic or mechanical problems pop up. Right now, it’s an excellent product that I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works great and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll save you the hassle. Don&#x27;t bother. I normally buzz my head and face with no guard 2-3 times a week. Weak and dull on the first use, after a full charge. The lovely stainless exterior hides a weak motor and the blades are not sharp at all. I was hoping for something powerful to replace a few cheap trimmers I went through in the last couple of years. My first was a pro model, by a different company, that a hairdresser got for me (was bulletproof 10 years). I&#x27;ve been through 3-4 since that one. This trimmer is not sharp. It&#x27;s not powerful. It tugs like heck on stubble, and I do not have a thick beard.  I have never had a trimmer tug. When I&#x27;ve un-boxed other new trimmers like this, they have always cut through my hair like butter, even the thick hair on my head. Disappointing. I don&#x27;t think it will cost much more to get a very good trimmer. This one is going back after two really annoying trims. I never even attempted shaving my head with the thing, It would never have worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally independent review. I wanted this thing to be awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, consider a corded model. If you forget to charge it on time, any model can run out of juice halfway through buzzing your head. And that is a hassle.</li>
    <li> super happy with this. the travel bag could be bigger though</li>
    <li> I missed a haircut appointment but needed a trimmer for the back of my neck in a hurry. So I went to a local big box store and paid more for this than I would have paid through Amazon. That said, I&#x27;m delighted with this trimmer. I&#x27;ve had a lot of them over the years but this one is closer than any I&#x27;ve had to a professional quality clipper. In fact, I was in for a haircut yesterday and saw one being used by one of the barbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I really like about this trimmer is the simple exterior design. It is very easy to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I primarily use the wide trimmer blade, as pictured, alternately with the circular nose-hair trimmer. They both work better than any I&#x27;ve ever owned. The Li battery powers a very strong motor. The blades snap off and on easily and all the parts seem to have a precision feel. I highly recommend this trimmer and I would not hesitate to buy another if I lost this one for some reason.</li>
    <li> If you like very short stubble, like 1mm, or want to edge your facial hair, this will not work. You&#x27;ll need a trimmer that has a blade that can be set to zero gap. Build quality is excellent though.</li>
    <li> This works great for trimming my beard and mustache. The charge lasts a long time, but the best part is the quality feel and weight of this unit which is much better than the less expensive units I&#x27;ve previously used. Hopefully this will last a long time.</li>
    <li> When it works, this groomer is really great: precise, easy and soft on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;However, it has stopped working just after 5 months of purchase.&lt;br /&gt;It started with not turning off properly and now it would not turn on at all.&lt;br /&gt;It could have been a great product...</li>
    <li> As expected, High finishing quality, good design and elegant, easy to use, good battery, keep charging for long time, durable, value of money, But recently I have got several problems, hard to turn it on and connect for charging, I keep trying to turn it on by moving it in different positions to make it charging but it doesn’t work, finally the control bottom is kept in &amp;#34;on position&amp;#34; and it doesn&#x27;t operate again. Apparently as I&#x27;ve read from customer reviews this is common problem in this model, I wish if I could to return it back Wahl but the shipping cost is too high from my place, Wahl should find way to solve this common problem and find resolution to this issue.</li>
    <li> Does a nice job and it keeps on ticking.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a Wahl-no need to say more.</li>
    <li> My husband is very satisfied with this groomer  He had stated it had to be stainless steel and this one is and after using it he is very happy.</li>
    <li> It is great for body and had hardy any trouble with cutting hair.</li>
    <li> I just got this so I don&#x27;t have a long term view of it, but I had previously purchased cheap plastic trimmers with NICAD or NIMH batteries that lasted for a couple months or so then died.  I decided I wanted to purchase the last trimmer I&#x27;d ever need (unless I lost it!), and this trimmer fits the bill.  As soon as you pull it out of the case you can feel how solidly constructed it is, I think I could probably throw it at a wall and it would be fine.  I did a beard/sideburn trim last night and it had zero problems.  It comes with a ton of attachments for both head type as well as trimming length.  Highly recommended, stop filling landfills with junky cheap trimmers and buy a good one that will last!</li>
    <li> This was not as sharp as I would have expected. I got the same level of closeness from my $10 electric shaver/groomer from Walgreens. What I do like is the Lithium Ion battery. Very nice touch. Overall it&#x27;s very well made (stainless steel body and blades). The attachments are very functional and there are a LOT of them so you can personalize your shave/trim.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. 👍🏻👍🏻&lt;br /&gt;Occasionally the off button needs to be pushed a few times to turn off.</li>
    <li> The bad things about it make it a pain to own. There&#x27;s a known problem with the power switch where sometimes it will not turn off, difficulty cleaning the whiskers from the mount chamber, too loud for ear hair trimmer, adjustable trimmer comb head easily broke, sharp t-blade comb covers, shaver attachment handles only slight whisker remover.  There&#x27;s so much potential for this device that without the flaws that make the device inconvenient it would be the perfect device. Very effective trimmers, changeable trim heads that work, design - use, looks and weight, length of battery life, quick charge and power.    Update: 12/05/2014: The attachments appear to have changed from the model I bought. Mine has the wider beard trim blade and the T-Blade, The nose hair trimmer and the shaver. I still occasionally have a problem with the power switch that does not shut off the device. You have to plug in the charger to make it stop. There&#x27;s a light that indicates that the device is charging that oes out when it is charged. The charger light doesn&#x27;t stay consistently illuminated. I&#x27;ve thought the device was charged because the light went out, but it wasn&#x27;t fully recharged. That connected takes a little fiddling to make the light stay on until it is charged.  I will say I do really like this device. It&#x27;s a staple in my grooming.</li>
    <li> after about a week of use, the trimmer would not shut off. I had to leave it on and let the battery die. The quality of the trimmer isn&#x27;t too different from the cheaper wahl trimmers, and also diameter of the base of the trimmer is very small so it&#x27;s kind of hard to balance it standing, it falls over easily. If I were buying a wahl trimmer I would get one of the 20 dollar versions, they suffice. Not much added value here.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor.  Unfortunately for some reason Wahl decided to stop included the most useful clips and the smaller blade which was better for trimming the face.  I can&#x27;t make any sense of their decision and this was dropped it all three stars IMO.  Only use this for body grooming, not facial and beard grooming.</li>
    <li> Less than 7 days old.  Unit simply turns on by itself and you cannot shut if off.  Others here have experienced the same thing, so this is not isolated but rather is a design defect.  No product support other than during &amp;#34;business hours&amp;#34; - and the device is obviously of a type that would normally be used OUTSIDE of business hours.  No online support.  No FAQs to address any ISSUES.  Frankly, just a disappointing, poor quality and poorly supported device.  I&#x27;m not interested in simply a replacement when there is a defect like this.  Unless they had real support that you could actually reach, and explain how to keep the unit from constantly running, the product and the company are both simply unacceptable.</li>
    <li> Having a full Beard for well over 30 years, finding a GOOD trimmer has been a long time quest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, 25 years ago Wahl had a Trimmer that did the job for $9.95, and its serviced me very well for all these years until I replaced it with the \\&quot;Wahl 9818\\&quot; two months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the old Wahl Trimmer still worked, but it had to be teased into working; plus I got tired of replacing AA batteries every 2 to 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Wahl 9818 is Lithium Ion, and runs forever!  And too, the balance in your hand is wonderful.  Very easy to use with lots of attachments that quite frankly I don&#x27;t use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely not sorry I bought this product, and would do it again for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Stick with a Wahl you can&#x27;t go wrong.This is the best one i bought yet and it is also my third.</li>
    <li> This is the first shaver I&#x27;m actually satisfied with. The battery is great, the accessories are plenty, and it&#x27;s basically all I need to keep my beard trimmed.</li>
    <li> Plastic clips broke on first use</li>
    <li> Professional fit and feel as I would expect from the price.  I believe it is a quality product.  Time will tell but if initial assessment is  any indication it will likely last me the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of this Wahl All-in-one Groomer.  I also like the way it trims my beard.  HOWEVER, I&#x27;ve only been able to used it about 10% since I&#x27;ve owned for almost a year now.  WHY?  The freaking thing is so temperamental.  Once you&#x27;re able to power ON, the freaking thing would power OFF on it&#x27;s own while I&#x27;m trimming my beard.  It would just completely STOP.  I would then try to power it back ON but it won&#x27;t power ON.  I will then end up plugging it back to electrical outlet and try to power it back ON.  Sometimes, it will power ON right away but most of the time it would not.  Often I end up trying to plug and unplug the unit multiple times trying to get this freaking thing to power ON.  It&#x27;s really that TEMPERAMENTAL AND UNRELIABLE.  I have tried to hold this unit as far away from the power button to make sure I don&#x27;t have any skin contact. It will sometimes work but that is such a small percentage compare to the frustration this caused.  I ended up trashing this groomer.  It doesn&#x27;t even deserve 1 star.  I paid $120.00 for this when I purchased it.  Now I understand why this has been marked down more than 50% from what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product here and received it shortly there after. I plugged it into charge. Less than an hour later the light on the power switch turned off indicating it had finished charging (that was fast!). I try and turn it on it doesn&#x27;t work. I try plugging it in again and the light turns on and off when I jiggle it. Bad connection? Don&#x27;t know. I take off the T-head and notice residual stubble inside. Some one had obviously purchased this item, used it and then returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seller than turned around and sold it to me as NEW when in fact it was not. I&#x27;m in the process of returning this product to seller, We&#x27;ll see how that goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still interested in this product but will not purchase from this seller again. Seller:Corydor which miraculously just changed to aSavings and I saw another name on there 20 min. ago too. Same page. This is really weird..... Why keep changing your name? Is it because you have shady buisness practices? ------ DO NOT BUY FROM THESE Sellers.</li>
    <li> Want to give it 5.....  really badly.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t however, because of a single flaw.&lt;br /&gt;The power switch, other reviews point out this flaw,  sometimes it will not shut off.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed mine does this,  if you press hard on the switch,  it will not power down, it hesitates,  then just stays on.  If you barely apply enough pressure to just activate the switch,  and let go,  it will power off as it is supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind of like double clicking a mouse at the wrong  frequency.  Once you get used to it,  it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;You shouldn&#x27;t Have to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However,  everything else about this shaver is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;The attachment combs are perfect,  allowing lots of beard hair between their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strong motor,  great system.</li>
    <li> Worth the extra cost. Cuts close and the battery life is terrific. I found the nose &amp; ear trimmer to be especially useful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, works well in Australia. Had to get a different plug but all good,as the wattage is appropiate to use without a travel adapter.</li>
    <li> After searching for an all in one personal groomer, I ended up choosing the Wahl 9818. It arrived in the mail and I plugged it in for an hour to make sure it was fully charged. I then started messing with different attachments. I will say for the record that I am not a very hairy guy, in fact I have very little hair compared to most of my friends and family. Anyhow I started on my chest with the main trimmer and it worked great. I then used the eyebrow piece and also no complaints, and same with the nose attachment. Then I moved on to a more....sensitive area. I&#x27;m going to speak bluntly here because this may be the reason you are looking to purchase this unit. I have sensitive skin in general and especially in the groin area, so I don&#x27;t like to shave with a razor down there. On the area above my dick I just used the standard trimmer and worked great, took off just about everything with little irritation. For my balls and weird angled areas, I used the #1 or shortest attachment to ensure no nicks or cuts. This also worked well and while there is obviously a very little amount of hair left, I am very satisfied with the result, and feel it served its purpose flawlessly. Overall I am very satisfied so far and would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a good all in one groomer.</li>
    <li> Nothing bad to say really. It does a good job, used it several times so far and haven&#x27;t needed to recharge it. It has a good weight and feels really solid. The options of guard sizes are more than I&#x27;ll probably ever need. The blade attachments are easy to switch over, and good quality themselves.</li>
    <li> Love this groomer, it&#x27;s much more powerful than the old Braun Cruzer I had. This keeps its charge for days and charges very quickly as well. Very easy to clean and I get a very nice clean cut with it whether I&#x27;m buzzing my head or my beard. not had a single problem with mine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for a while and it seems to go forever one a charge. Amazing.  It does everything you expect and more with the plethora of attachments.  I&#x27;m still learning what they all do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having it for a while, I noticed that the standard clipper head was missing a couple of teeth.  Figuring I dropped it or something, I called Wahl to order a replacement.  The replacement was $10, but they insisted on sending one out for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that is what I call good customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris</li>
    <li> This was the BEST shaver I&#x27;ve ever had, until I could not turn it off! Shaking it doesn&#x27;t do it ad I bet I can&#x27;t return this to WAhl without paying half the cost to ship it. Blah</li>
    <li> This is great, great price, have ordered another one of my staff</li>
    <li> Product is fantastic and the seller provided everything as expected.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> very nice trimmer. just not shower friendly.</li>
    <li> gets stuck on once in a while as others reviews say. I use it as a full body groomer and it hardly ever has to be charged and is effective. best shaver i have EVER purchased.</li>
    <li> After a couple months of use on my beard &amp; mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: blades feel like they&#x27;ll last a lifetime; good feel in the hand; battery lasts forever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: flimsy plastic clip-on guide is what they mean by multi-groomer; no detail grooming head; changing heads is not difficult but inconvenient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that all-in-one does not mean one-piece.  In order to fully groom my beard and mustache, I need to change heads a few times and use the clip-on guide.  I was really looking for a groomer that would be less time-consuming, but am not overly disappointed because the main unit is so well-built.  The lack of a detail groomer is disappointing.  The docs say it can be purchased separately, but really is essential from the get-go.</li>
    <li> Nice instrument if you want to avoid the wire and can stand a little more weight.</li>
    <li> This trimmer makes you look forward to your trim and shave. You can thin your beard, mustache and even your nose or ear hair. The charging is very fast and most of all it is very dependable.&lt;br /&gt;I had a Brand X before I got this one. Had to replace it 3 times and descided that was enough chances for them.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier or find any that could do better.&lt;br /&gt;Caution; if you trim your mustache with the wider blade, it can cut your lip. It really cuts close!</li>
    <li> Solid. Went on vacation overseas and used it every 3 days for almost 40 days. Came back from my trip more than 2 wks ago ... still usinh it ecery 2 to 3 days and have yet to charge it still!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon, I got it at a local drug store and paid a little more, but I wanted to see it firsthand and had to comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a few beard trimmers, cheap plastic ones that were given as gifts, so when my last one died, I wanted to get a good one. This one is solid, stainless steel body and a little heavy, but you can tell it is well built. The teeth on the blades are small and close together, unlike my last one, and hasn&#x27;t nicked me yet. Trims really close, as close as you can get without a razor or shaver. I used to shave my head but don&#x27;t like it completely smooth and my last trimmer didn&#x27;t cut as close as this one. The heads are easily changeable, they just snap on and off. Now a little TMI, being an older guy, you get hair growing in places hair should not grow and the small trimmer attachment works great for getting inside your ears and the round nose trimmer works good too. There is also a trimmer head that covers the blades completely, allowing you to trim those \\&quot;personal\\&quot; areas without getting bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never had a problem turning it on and off and even if I did, it would still be worth the trouble. I also like the fact that it DID NOT come with a base, I hate those things, more stuff to clutter up the counter and more plastic to throw away. It did come with a small travel pouch which holds all the attachments just fine. I just put it in the drawer, I&#x27;ve had it for two months and haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet and I use it to shave my head weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t endorse this trimmer enough, Wahl makes great corded hair trimmers used by most barber shops and this one is probably just as good if not better that the electric trimmer I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You WILL NOT be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Right from the first use, ON / OFF button is not working properly. Battery also stopped charging. I will never ever buy product from WAHL again.</li>
    <li> Amazing razor. I will get this again when I break this one. Absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> Great groomer, trimmer.</li>
    <li> Excelent shaver.  Built to last and with a great variety of accessories included.</li>
    <li> Like others have said sometimes you cant power it off and have to plug it into the charger for it to turn off. The power button is sketchy in general.</li>
    <li> Cuts a very clean line along the beard edge.  Easily trims hair with the attached guards.  Good power.  Much better than my old trimmer that used AA batts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little hairs do tend to get into the space under the head.  But they&#x27;re easily brushed/blown out.  Just make sure to check that every now and then to make sure it stays clean.</li>
    <li> Disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer was fantastic until it decided (only two months after purchase) to never turn off.  The only way to turn it off now is by plugging in the charger.  This is a well documented problem with other reviews to validate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I called for warranty service, a rude, snotty person informed me that the turnaround time for service is approximately a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No thank you. I&#x27;ll buy another brand.</li>
    <li> Delivered as advertised.</li>
    <li> everything works fine. good quality for money</li>
    <li> The rechargeable battery is nice, and the product feels very well made. The nose trimmer is a nice extra. My two gripes: sometimes the button doesn&#x27;t work very well. You have to use the plug or the red hole plug to force it to turn off or act as kind of a reset to get the button to work. A minor annoyance, but not a deal breaker. The other gripe is that the adapter lengths jump in size too quickly. I either cut my hair annoyingly short or just a little too long. I learned my lesson with the annoyingly short and will be using the a little too long adapter next time. Last thing, don&#x27;t get this thing wet! Splashes happen, but I wouldn&#x27;t rinse it or take it in the shower. It leaves a lot to be desired, but I still prefer it to the other options I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> The new facial clippers/trimmers out there are scary! I was worried these would not be strong enough because I have had trouble with Wahl in past. However, these are perfect, strong, very sharp. Very good cut! These should last a long time.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews for their less expensive models, most dissatisfied customers were given a free upgrade to this model. Why not just skip the frustration and go for something that&#x27;s going to last?</li>
    <li> I want people who own this product to remember to not leave there device in the bathroom b/c the humidity will leave dew on your product and will eventually rust.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Wahl trimmer for years.  I decided to buy a new one about a year ago.  It was only $15 but I wanted to stay with Wahl because of how much I liked the first one.  The $15 Wahl trimmer totally sucked.  It was horrible.  I just purchased and used the Wahl 9818 trimmer and let me tell you, it is awesome!  Wahl got it right.  The trimmer cuts with such ease and is the best trimmer I have ever used.  I highly recommend this trimmer to anyone!  I was wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like it or not but I am so pleased that I purchased it.  I am completely happy with hit.  Thank you Wahl and thank you Amazon for having it on sale!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer less than 6 months and it&#x27;s now kaput. It began developing charging issues almost immediately, and now it won&#x27;t charge at all. When it DID work, it did a fair job, although the attachments are flimsy and cheaply constructed. The unit itself seems much better made than it is, but I see by others&#x27; reviews that the charging issue is a common problem with this model. As much as I hate the wire  -I&#x27;m probably going back to a corded trimmer.</li>
    <li> My Remington trimmer died finally after 10 years of use- so I went looking for a replacement.  This had reasonable reviews - so I was hopeful it would work well even though I hadn&#x27;t heard of this manufacturer.  After using it for 6 months or so I can say that it is difficult to work with, doesn&#x27;t cut my beard well, requires way too much pressure on the hair to get the cutting started etc. etc.  I can put the trimmer on my beard or mustache - and it doesn&#x27;t start trimming until I jam it inside the beard.  It will not trim on the outside.  In other words for the simple task it is designed for - it fails.  Back to a known brand.....</li>
    <li> Works great. Feels like a professional tool. Fast and easy for beard trimming.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to estimate long term dependability but at this time it does everything very well.  You&#x27;re not overwhelmed with accessories You won&#x27;t use.  Battery life is very good.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this trimmer because it seems to be one of the better made ones out there (stainless steel!), but it&#x27;s junk. I wish I&#x27;d read the reviews prior to buying it, since the problems I&#x27;ve had seem to be common.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day one of owning it was great! It worked just as it should and I was a happy customer. A day later, it started to act up -- I couldn&#x27;t power it off! I had to plug it in to turn it off, since it conveniently doesn&#x27;t work while it&#x27;s plugged in. Also, it has stopped charging unless the cable is held at a certain angle. Seriously disappointed.</li>
    <li> Finally a pair of clippers that hold up. Heavy duty feel, and plenty of attachments. I love these clippers so far. Nice close trim.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of trimmers out there to buy but this one is definitely the best. My Son loves it.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the performance of the Wahl stainless clipper set for the first month. Has met expectations and delivered as advertised for beard and hair trimming. Battery life has been very good with minimal charging required - about once monthly.</li>
    <li> This thing holds a charge forever. It cuts through my thick hair with ease. Most of the attachments are useful for me. It feels like a quality product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son. He says that it gave him a good shave. He says that it also nicked him. I asked if that is common, he says usually on older shavers. It looks good and the other reviews have me optimistic that it will be a quality shaver.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a combination travel shaver, nose trimmer, and a detail tool.  I did a lot of research online, in stores, asking friends.  This baby is powerful!!!!  I think my nose hairs are scared to grow after this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real reason I put this review...&lt;br /&gt;2 weeks after I got this I found a problem many have run into.  For some reason, this device would not turn off.  I tried pressing and pressing did not come off.  So I put the red stopper in the bottom (if you read the manual it says they ship it with this red thingy to put on the bottom so it does not come on when traveling... THATS A MAJOR PLUS FOR ME)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the stopper in and I called WAHL.  Within minutes they had gotten my details and shipped a replacement out.  It came 5 days later and I shipped the defective item back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WAHL has my business for life.</li>
    <li> This is a great beard trimmer. The battery is strong and long lasting. The design is sleek. There are enough guard sizes for most needs. The only problem, and the reason that this is not 5 stars, is that the trimming guards can be difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> This is the second Wahl unit I have and it does not disappoint.  Great unit very high quality x x</li>
    <li> Wayyyy better than those plastic adjustable heads. I cut and trim my beard and give my self haircuts. Easy peasy. Good battery life and feels heavy and worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought the Wahl Lithium Ion Stainless just shy of a year ago and have been using it and loving it ever since!  However, it took many other electric shavers before I arrived at this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a beard since I was 17 and since I got scared off of blade shaving after slicing myself up a treat when I was young, I went to electric shaving for over 30 years.  I tried a bunch of them, Norelco, Remingtons, and finally Brauns (yes, plurals as indicated).  As I went from one to the next, the quality of the shaver did improve as I went.  But, although each had a trimmer function, it was really treated like an add-on, something that was put on as more of an afterthought than as a distinct feature.  And, that showed in how well, or more to the point how *poorly*, they worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I finally returned to blade shaving, I knew I would need to buy a trimmer (especially since my Braun finally vibrated itself to pieces), and I REALLY wanted to find a good, solid trimmer that would do a neat, quality, and preferably quiet job for me.  As I usually do, I researched for quite a while, trying to find The Best Trimmer.  I knew that Wahl made a number of different trimmers and that my wife (who was a professional hair stylist for 19 years) has always used Wahl trimmers in her business.  I did look at other brands of trimmers, too, but I kept returning to Wahl.  How can you go wrong by looking deeper into a company that has a long history of quality products that are (better yet!) made in the USA?  Answer:  You can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl makes a plethora of trimmers - cool.  One thing that was very important to me was excellent battery life.  Because of this, the words &amp;#34;Lithium Ion&amp;#34; popped out at me during one of my searches, leading me to this trimmer.  It was stylish, excellent battery type, and had tons of accessories &amp; combs.  Looked *extremely* promising, so I ordered it.  The results?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this groomer/trimmer!  It really does feel good &amp; solid in your hand, not flimsy nor poorly-made; it has a very balanced heft to it, too, so your hand is not going to tire out from holding it, either.  And, oh, is it QUIET!  Unlike every other electric razor/trimmer combo that I&#x27;ve owned, this puppy is incredibly quiet, yet still powerful enough to go right thru the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life?  Stellar.  I&#x27;ve charged it 4 times in the last 10.5 months (one being the initial charge).  It typically lasts me about 3 months on a charge, since I tend to &amp;#34;train&amp;#34; batteries by running them thru 3 full charge/discharge cycles when they&#x27;re new (and this is the last of those 3 cycles, new charge + 3 more).  An old habit I got into that may not be relevant for current battery types, yet still seems to serve me well in conditioning the batteries for long life.  And yes, this Wahl gives me an extended span of usage per charge, especially when compared to all the older models I used to have.  I trim for ~15 minutes each week, plus the occasional touch-up, and I get about 3 months per charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attachments?  Plenty of them - more than you&#x27;ll need.  Now, some folks whose review I read before buying have dinged this groomer for having too many attachments.  Not valid, really; if you don&#x27;t need &#x27;em, don&#x27;t use &#x27;em.  The fact is, Wahl gives you plenty of OPTIONS for you to choose from!  Find the ones which are most useful to you and stash the rest - simple!  I haven&#x27;t changed the head from the blade to another blade, or the nose hair trimmer (yet), but I will - I just haven&#x27;t gotten the urge to do so.  As for the combs, I tried a bunch of them and finally settled on two that I use every week; first the longer one, then the shorter one.  Works perfectly and gives me a neat, well-groomed look in an easier, FASTER fashion than I&#x27;ve ever been able to accomplish before.  I&#x27;ve even had multiple comments on how nicely trimmed my beard is, but only after I started using the Wahl 9818.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other complaint isabout the plastic stand.  Pshaw, people, what do you want, a really good trimmer, or an overpriced stand on which to place said trimmer?  I&#x27;ll take the first, thank you.  Yes, it&#x27;s a plain, clear plastic stand that is 100% functional and just the right size.  They designed it to hold your trimmer in the same position, allowing it to be plugged in or not, as needed.  If it&#x27;s plugged in, you can easily see the charge light as it stands there, so you know that it&#x27;s done when the light goes out.  Works perfectly, unobtrusive, and because it&#x27;s not unnecessarily fancy, they didn&#x27;t have to up the price to cover anything you didn&#x27;t need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:  This trimmer is worth every penny!  I am completely and totally happy that I bought it, I love its style, form, &amp; functionality, and I&#x27;d buy it again in a heartbeat if I needed another one.about the plastic stand.

    <li> On the search for a new trimmer! Stumbled upon this one on my search and figured I&#x27;d leave a review. Had this for 6 months.. Bought it at Walmart. Worked GREAT while it worked.. Then it would NOT turn off and just stopped working. Seems to be a common issue after looking through the reviews. I figured for the price it would be a decent trimmer.. I would have been happy if it would have at least lasted 2 years.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this piece of trash! Used once and since then it hasn&#x27;t turned off. In the instructions it says to keep it off plug it in, did just that and then I couldn&#x27;t get it to turn on. Left the house and came back it was on and still can&#x27;t turn it off. Decided to shave and it&#x27;s still running. Shaves great and battery lasts forever, just to bad you can&#x27;t turn it off!!!</li>
    <li> The biggest benefit to this unit is that it&#x27;s just as easy to trim my beard as it is to cut my hair as it is to brush my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problems that I have with this unit is that it seems to not do well with my hair.  I have a lot of very thick hair and I attribute much of the problems I had with the unit to this.  I spent a lot of time trimming my beard going over places that didn&#x27;t get cut evenly on the first few passes.  When cutting the hair on my head, the unit seemed underpowered on a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s where it gets awesome...  I made a call to Wahl and they&#x27;re standing behind their product and providing some excellent customer service providing me with a different unit that may work better for me.  Thanks Wahl for being awesome!</li>
    <li> So many attachments to try, some are not manufactured well, causing some minor fit problems. But the groomer handle and blades are wonderful. Oil is provided, and trim blades are SHARP! There are enough trim lengths to make my beard awesome with a minimum of effort. This trimmer does not shoot the trimming all over, but rather lets them fall easily into the sink. This is the best trimmer that I have owned.</li>
    <li> Great product.  The old trimmer was plastic so the added weight took a little getting use to.  The battery holds up good and quickly charges.  Blades are very sharp and cut smooth.  The old one lasted for many years until something open up in the motor.  I expect this product will last for my years too.</li>
    <li> I bought this groomer so i can groom my &amp;#34;downstairs region&amp;#34; but the size clips that go on it are a bit to sharp for my liking (Yikes!) It is good for facial trimming and all that jazz so its good in that way.</li>
    <li> I bought the stainless steel Wahl because I assumed (foolishly, in retrospect) that it would be higher quality, more durable, longer lasting than the cheaper Wahl beard trimmers (groomsman) I&#x27;ve purchased previously.  I really wanted to like this trimmer, and my first impression was positive.  That first impression did not last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a complete piece of junk. The battery died shortly after I purchased it. Well... actually, I suspect that the real problem was the connection to the battery charger that is the problem. Whenever I plugged the trimmer in to charge, the connection always seemed somewhat flimsy and suspect. Regardless of whether the problem was the battery or the charger, the trimmer died within a couple months of purchase. I called Wahl to ask about warranty coverage and was impressed with the response. They sent me a new trimmer within a week or so. Unfortunately, within a couple of months the replacement trimmer experienced the exact same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Heavy duty feel.  Many different attachments to select the correct hight to trim.  On/off button is a little hard to use.  Also it will not work while charging.</li>
    <li> I keep my beard very short and it seems to do the job well</li>
    <li> Bought for hubby, he loves it!</li>
    <li> Am from Nigeria and i have suffered from underperforming shavers in the past. Am so happy i stumble upon this. And for those asking about the voltage. Well this device 9819 wahl grimmer is a universal product</li>
    <li> This is a very nice, functional trimmer. The product has a feeling of quality in your hand, like a well made tool.</li>
    <li> This is an expensive but not particularly well engineered groomer. It is definitely not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design defects:&lt;br /&gt;Cutting head is too narrow - perhaps half to 3/4 of an inch useful surface, so your beard gets hacked up no matter how careful you are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combs are cheap, flimsy plastic. Of the twelve or so included with the groomer, only two actually fit on the cutting head! Clearly whoever packed this chose the wrong parts. Of the two that fit on the head, they do not gauge depth so much as interfere with the cutting process, so you can&#x27;t get an accurate trim, at all, with the comb on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low powered. I had a Norelco before, which wore out after four years. It was much more powerful and cut cleanly and evenly. This groomer has maybe 1/3 the power of the Norelco, when it&#x27;s fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short battery life. Supposedly Li-Ion batteries last longer. Not in this case. Three, maybe four uses and it&#x27;s dead. Plus since the battery effectively runs on &amp;#34;low speed&amp;#34; all the time it is RIPPING rather than CUTTING your facial hair, which is uncomfortable and makes your beard all frizzy and unkempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heavy - it weighs about 14 ounces and is balanced poorly so using it wears out your shoulder and neck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vibrates heavily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Switch works maybe 25% of the time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutting head cannot be disassembled for cleaning, even though the instructions say it can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions enclosed did not go with the 9818 model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nose and ear hair trimmer in the ad pictures does not come with it. Supposedly this is a FACIAL HAIR trimmer but in fact they send accessories (which don&#x27;t fit and don&#x27;t work) that are for haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first, and last, Wahl brand tool. I partly bought it because it was supposedly &amp;#34;made in America&amp;#34; yet all the parts except the case are stamped &amp;#34;China&amp;#34; or have no origin stamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this gizmo. I&#x27;d havedone better with my money lighting my cigar with a $50 bill.</li>
    <li> This groomer is VERY well made. The shape, look and feel in your hand are all top-notch. The amount of supplied accessories gives you a lot of options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was even more impressed with this grooming tool than I thought I would be (and I expect a lot of what I consider tools).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic tool and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was waiting for my flimsy beard trimmer to break before i invested in a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; one.&lt;br /&gt;This has surpassed my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I love the weight, the build quality is amazing and it&#x27;s by far the best clippers I&#x27;ve had. (Why did I wait, I ask..)&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a full set of guards and different heads (very easy to with from one to the other) I love the T-Blade.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a little bag to keep it all together (Actually that would be my only complaint, you can&#x27;t fit everything in the bag- but if you&#x27;re like me you only ever use 1 or 2 of the guards and maybe 2 accessories- so it works)&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend it enough, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I used it for a month before charging it. Very impressed!</li>
    <li> this is what I have been looking for a while now. It makes grooming much easier and quicker. I use it for the side burns and beard shaping, works well, I would definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Is an amazing razor but a week into having it it wouldn&#x27;t turn off so I had to disassemble it to fix it and put it back together, lucky I knew what I was doing but that sucks for a new razor. It is however a very good razor and i still use it all the time</li>
    <li> Bought this at target for ~ $54 after a $5 instant rebate. Plugged it in, let it charge until the led went off and then began to shave. Not only did the &amp;#34;superior&amp;#34; trimmer blade catch and irritate my skin more than any other shaver I have ever used but upon trying to turn it off, it simply didn&#x27;t respond. Great,  a travel razor you can only turn off by shoving the poorly thought-out red plastic stopper into the charging port or plugging it into a wall. I spent an extra $20 on this product over another because it was manufactured and designed in America and Wahl has really given that badge a bad name. I will never buy another Wahl product again. I have seen other reviews with this same theme (and this exact same on/off problem) - perhaps Wahl doesn&#x27;t actually employ a quality assurance team to test products before taking them off the line and shoving them onto shelves across America.</li>
    <li> Very good trimmer best I have gotten so far havee had several before accurate and long battery life real happy with the wahl product.</li>
    <li> That is good item for beards, but my head have thick dense hair and this is just a stops groomer.</li>
    <li> The power switch, as others have commented, is too small and too hard to press. One can always push in the easy-to-lose travel &amp;#34;accidental power-on preventer.&amp;#34; (I have not had to do that.) As a groomer it works well though not significantly better than the cheap Chinese Remington stuff. Feels and looks good. American-made which is nice but I wonder where the parts come from?</li>
    <li> Sleak and well built, great battery life. Have used everyday since i got it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve encountered the same problem with charger as other reviewers. But I got a good year out of mine before any issues so I bought a second one. Now I have double the accoutrements. Other than the charging issues it has been a great performing and looking shaver. Works on whole body.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my husbands old Wahl which was a cheaper plastic model. This stainless steel groomer meets and exceeds all expectations. My husband absolutely loves it!</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve used. Far superior to Norelco equivalents.</li>
    <li> Nice to use and the heads swap out easily.&lt;br /&gt;It weights a lot, which isn&#x27;t a good thing to me (for travel) but others would associate the feel with quality.&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that I wish it had more beard length trimmers or an adjustable trimmer attachment. An adjustable one might help reduce the number of little parts this comes with.</li>
    <li> So this trimmer is used to groom my beard and mustache. usually I do this in the bathroom, around a sink, usually a sink has water in it. So why would wahl make a trimmer that you cannot submerge, if even accidentally?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I say this is I have a cordless toothbrush in the same price range and its COMPLETELY WATERPROOF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the worst grooming buy ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it was something like a broken blade caused by me, I would overlook it and get a new blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needs a charging stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop making unfinished products like this and putting a made in USA seal on it, make it right from the start, so disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to call wahl to get my groomer fixed or replaced because its broken and I am mad because I still have hair and stubble on my face, and I have somewhere to go; I have nothing else to shave my face with but a epilady; winning!</li>
    <li> I have had this for 3 or 4 years now, and it is working very well.  The reason for the downgrade is that the battery is not user replaceable.  The user needs to return the clipper to Whal for battery replacement, and Whal&#x27;s receiving department seems to be overwhelmed with shipments.  However, to Wahl&#x27;s credit they replaced my battery when it recently died.</li>
    <li> Works great, powerfull enough to make anything with your hear without pulling off your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it about a 1,5 month before and charged it.&lt;br /&gt;After that used it 3 times about 10 minutes each.&lt;br /&gt;Still keeps change.&lt;br /&gt;Steel body is very comfortable and nice.&lt;br /&gt;Some folks write that it&#x27;s noisy - for me it&#x27;s not true, my previous devise was much more noisy...</li>
    <li> Oh, it&#x27;s a real beauty, shiny and made of metal ... on the outside at least.  And, it&#x27;s heavy, but so is my plastic Philips Norelco G370.  Most of the weight of these gizmos is the weight of the battery ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nose trimmer is great, and, I suspect, so are the beard and hair trimmers, but those work well on the G370.  But, the main reason I bought this device was to replace the foil shaver attachment on the G370, a replacement which is no longer available from Philips.  The Wahl shaver attachment is built as they say, like the proverbial tank.  Trouble is, it doesn&#x27;t cut hair very short, especially nose hairs, the ones that are left behind by the nose trimmer, the ones that the foil shaver attachment on the Philips made short work of, the ones that drive me crazy.  The grating, or cage, around the cutting blade is thick and heavy, no way will it wear through like the one on the g370, but, it is so thick that it doesn&#x27;t, can&#x27;t, cut very close to the skin -- my electric shaver cuts far shorter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what I have is a pretty shiny, somewhat useful device that did not meet my expectations (and which, for me,  rates no stars at all), but which, nevertheless, is well made.  I hope that Wahl corrects the shaver attachment design in the future.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s shiny, it&#x27;s sleek, and definitely powerful. I&#x27;ve run it down a few times already to make sure the battery holds up well and it does so far anyway. So two major concerns thus far is the power button. Something other people have been frustrated with before. The button is difficult to turn on and off. The micro switch underneath is sticky it doesn&#x27;t always turn on and off easily. When on the blue light is intense. Its not really an issue for me but it might be to some. Second the trimmer seems to pull sometimes.  Obviously that happens sometimes but I feel it happens significantly more often then it should. Other than those two issues I think the groomer works well enough. I am concerned about the pulling and power button. I&#x27;ll have to wait and find out.</li>
    <li> Great quality, features, and price.  It has a stable and balanced feel to it.  Definitely a professional quality grooming razor.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I first saw the Wahl 9818 at my local Walgreen&#x27;s and wanted one. I admired its heft, minimalist design, and the fact that it was not made with plastic, but rather with stainless steel. A few days later I ordered mine from Amazon. It comes with an assortment of guards. And, the trimmer head pops right off to accommodate a nose/ear trimmer and also a very small detail trimmer.  However, the only attachment that is missing for me is a guard that is slightly bigger than the smallest one - but not as big as the next one up. The smallest guard leaves my beard with a nice clean stubble look, but that&#x27;s too short for me. The next size up would be too long. The groomer cannot be used while charging, as other reviews point out. But, that is not an issue. It seems to hold a charge very well. The off/on button is a bit stiff and is difficult to activate at times. One time I cleaned the head under running water and then I could not turn it off. I plugged in the charging cable and that made it turn off. It was back to normal after the electrical components dried. It is a bit expensive but I do expect that from a quality product. I would have given it 5 stars if the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; guard size had been included. Otherwise, I think it is an excellent product from a proven company.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year now, and am happy to report its true value. The All-in-one groomer&#x27;s performance is admirable. The battery charge continues to last for days. Best of all is this product&#x27;s feel. Wahl 9818 is simple, and has the heft of a piece of professional equipment. I only wish that other prsonal products were built this well.</li>
    <li> I have had around 6 of these and have a few laying around. The reason is they stop charging after a few uses. I kept buying another thinkin the problem would be corrected, but something is wrong with how it plugs in. I have 1 I still use as my only trimmer, and it is only on occasion that it will charge. I have to put it on the bathroom counter and turn the cord in different directions to try to get it to charge, and sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. It does the best job at trimming and not snagging than any trimmer I&#x27;ve used, but it simply can&#x27;t be relied on to charge. So sometimes I just have to use the little bit of juice it has and knock down my bear and then shave it with a razor. If it were reliable on charging, this thing would be the best thing in the planet. It must be something to do with the contact made where the cable plugs in at the bottom.</li>
    <li> I usually love Wahl products.  And while this one is great at trimming neck hair and sideburns, it&#x27;ll nick you quick in more sensitive areas.  Guess that&#x27;s why God invented the &amp;#34;safety razor&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> stopped working. only used two times. cannot turn off.</li>
    <li> After just 3 months the &amp;#34;on-off&amp;#34; button has failed, it won&#x27;t shut off. You would hope that after so many reviews on this problem that it would have been addressed by now. It&#x27;s clear that this company doesn&#x27;t care! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!  7/12/15</li>
    <li> I did not heed all the reviewer warnings of this unit failing to take a charge or turn on after minimal use. Had 3 months before it essentially died. Only used it once a week. I was swayed by the look and paid the price (literally). Next trimmer will be cheap and plastic and I will just store it away out of sight.</li>
    <li> Love the width. Great for doing inside ears (flat skin only). These are really sharp</li>
    <li> Love it. Charge lasts a long time. Cuts great. Included a pile of attachments.</li>
    <li> piece of garbage... Bought it two months ago and it is already broken. Stay away from this product. Can&#x27;t even return it..</li>
    <li> On its way to be replaced.  The on/off button sticks, sometimes works  some times not&lt;br /&gt;Will try a replacement one time, then its time for refund</li>
    <li> Have had it over a year and the battery life is still great.  Cuts strong like a ac powered one.&lt;br /&gt;Was a little more costly to buy but I think it was well worth it so far.</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t turn off not happy at all</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair with the Lithium Ion Groomer.  It is easy to use and does a good job.  This saves us haircut money every month.</li>
    <li> I replaced my faithful Wahl trimmer I had for more than 10 years. After having quite a few of the crappy models you get at Wal-Mart made by panasonic, remington and all the other less expensive brands I ended up buying this trimmer. This thing is solid and powerful. it does in one swipe what others take repeated attempts. I get 0 pulled hairs too and that is a huge plus. The attachments fit snuggly and stay on. As to the reviews about the power button, you have to be smarter than the product. Mine works great with 0 complaints. I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> really good price fast shipping can say was everything i expected and more, i will recomend this to anyone !</li>
    <li> This is an excellent Groomer, with a whole slew of attachments of various kinds, Its made of steel and is obviously built for the long haul, great charger and the battery stays charged for many many uses, havn&#x27;t charged it in 3 weeks and use it regularly, well worth the extra coin.</li>
    <li> This clipper is awesome, its compact and built with tight specifications making it a precise tool for grooming. works great so far..... worth every penny......</li>
    <li> Product arrived used and two of the combs were cracked. Returned and replaced with the Philips Norelco BG2040/34 BodyGroom 7100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Philips-Norelco-BG2040-34-BodyGroom/dp/B0037HP9OA/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hpc_12?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;1JG1FVBSGXJ9PEH9VV2Y</li>
    <li> I wanted to write a review on this item in-order to not only educate others about what to expect, but to also provide those that are looking at this particular item with some additional information in-order to help everyone make the best decision possible. With that being said, let me begin by saying that this item seems to be well made at-least cosmetically anyway due to the fact that it is made out of stainless steel, and for the most part feels pretty solid due to its overall weight. However, even though the item says that its made in the USA, its parts are unfortunately made in China, which in-turn basically means that it is put together in the USA despite the fact that its components are manufactured in China. As a result, the item&#x27;s actual performance seems to demonstrate this mainly in part, because the trimmer does not seem to cut your hair very well nor does it seem to hold up all that great either especially in-the-event that it gets wet. As you can see, the first time that I used this trimmer, I noticed that it took a lot longer to trim my facial hair, while at the same time tearing my face up in the process due to the fact that its blade attachments are both cheaply made and not best suited for facial use. In addition, after I was finished trimming my facial hair in-order to make it easier for me to shave, I rinsed off the trimmer with water in-an-attempt to remove all of the hair off of it only to discover that the trimmer would not turn off mainly in part, because any bit of water that gets into the trimmer will ultimately cause the trimmer&#x27;s power button to malfunction. All in all, I was hoping to get a decent product mainly in part, because the item said it was made in the USA. However, I only ended up purchasing a $60.00 piece of junk that for all intents and purposes performed less effectively than my old $25.00 Remington trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is a good groomer, I&#x27;m very happy with it but I need a 3/16\\&quot; comb that fits the T-Bar so I can shave my head with something wider than the #3 grooming comb supplied. I called the company and they replaced the comb that came broken and told me that there&#x27;s a 3/16\\&quot; comb from another model that fits the T-Bar they&#x27;ll throw in for free. When I got the  broken comb replacement, the extra comb wasn&#x27;t in the package. I called again but they sent me another #3 comb to fit the grooming head. Maybe I didn&#x27;t specify it needs to fit the T-bar??? I&#x27;m pretty impressed with the customer seervice I&#x27;ve got so far even though I still don&#x27;t have the comb I need.</li>
    <li> Works well for what it&#x27;s supposed to be a stopgap between barber visits</li>
    <li> So far so good. I got it very fast. The only thing I have found as drowback is that I did not get a receipt with this item.</li>
    <li> I bought this item a year and a half ago. It had to go back for repair because it would not turn off. That lasted about five months when it happened again. After contacting Wahl, they decided after ten days to replace it without me having to return it. Pretty good customer service so I give them four stars for that.</li>
    <li> Worked great for about a year until it got splashed with a small amount of water shaving beard in the shower. NOT for shower use! Sadly had to switch to a lesser quality over all but shower proof Phillips Norelco brand as Wahl doesn&#x27;t offer a water resistant model yet.</li>
    <li> This does a good trim job, but I am still looking for the perfect beard trimmer... this isn&#x27;t it.  My previous beard trimmer was a Braun, which did OK (I thought) but it wore out after just 1 year.  After I began using this Wahl (I&#x27;ve had it for 3 months now), I realized what a poor job my Braun had really been doing.  The trim on this is tremendous, very even, very smooth, and does not bog down or tug when cutting hair or beard.  The charge is fast and lasts a long time.  What I don&#x27;t like is (1) the weight--with a body made of metal, this is much heavier than my Braun was.  I am probably building wrist muscles every time I shave.  (2) The angle is very different from the Braun, making it  a little harder to hold in the right position.  Coupled with the extra weight, this makes it rather uncomfortable to use.  (3) My Braun adjusted easily to any trim length.. with this Wahl, any time I want to change the trim length, I have to pull a comb head off and put a different comb head on, which is not actually very easy to achieve.  One comb head has already broken--they are not very sturdy.  All in all, although this Wahl gives a great trim, it is very uncomfortable to use and more difficult to manage than it seems like it should be.  I am looking for a replacement.</li>
    <li> Thought I had a winner, but found out it&#x27;s crap and cannot use this junk anymore. &amp;#34;only as strong as its weakest link&amp;#34; Seems durable, but the rubber power button fell apart and it is a complete waste of time and failure to try power on to shave. So frustrated with this worthless crap and back to my old Remington trimmer. You got me John F. Wahl ! you got my money and duped me with a pie to my face. Eff U 2.</li>
    <li> The best trimmer I have ever used, hands down.</li>
    <li> Really like it, but it won&#x27;t charge anymore- bad connection to the cord or something. Huge bummer since I bought it as a gift to last a while, it made it about 6 months. When it works, it does a great job...</li>
    <li> You can buy less expensive but not with the same quality.  I expect to use mine for years.  Performance is excellent. &amp;#34;Himself&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I bought the Wahl 9818 after my Wahl 9854 died. The 9854 lasted me 3 years and did a fantastic job. I was very pleased with it and so I decided to &#x27;upgrade&#x27; and get the 9818 because it had a stainless steel body which made for easier cleaning than the 9854 rubber overmold which hairs would stick to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regretted purchasing the 9818 after the first cut. The blade gets stuck/caught on hair and pulls, which is quite painful. I cut my hair with the 1/8&amp;#34; trimmer and never had an issue with hair pulling using the 9854.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It now takes me 2x longer to cut my hair with this trimmer because if I go too quickly (which is still quite slow) the blade pulls on my hair. In the end, the cut hair looks good, but the time and pain required to get there is not worth it. I need to go back to the $35 9854. Not happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a nice cordless trimmer with the power to cut through a thick beard without pulling (so far). However, as others have stated, I too am disappointed at the lack of a 1.5 length guard. Going from a 2 to a 1 is a big difference when you&#x27;re talking about the hair on your face. Maybe Wahl will recognize the need for this length guard...</li>
    <li> I was tired of buying cheap trimmers at drugstores every 8 months. I said I was gonna bite the bullet &amp; buy a good expensive trimmer. Then I found this one. Excellent quality at a mid range price. You notice the quality when you first pick it up. It&#x27;s metal, not plastic! The lithium ion battery is also a huge bonus. It holds a charge well &amp; has a quick charge feature. The unit is very quiet as well. It came with detailing trimmers, blade lubricant, &amp; nose/ear trimmer. I only wish it had a few more adapters for the attachments. I see this lasting for a very long time.</li>
    <li> wish it had some sort of material to make it not as slick but I love it</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with lots of accessories, but lacking the important combs.&lt;br /&gt;The number 1 comb is very short while comb number 2 leaves beard very long, messy and un trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;This product is defanetly not the one you are looking for if you want to keep a nice, full, trimmed beard.&lt;br /&gt;This has 2 settings either shaved or messy.  And in this price range I would expect larger variety of necessary combs to groom a beard without having to buy the modern,  digital length trimmers.  Now,  after buying I know I made a mistake and that I should have go with a digital trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Fyi - no additional lengths combs are being sold as an additional products to this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - waste of money.  Do not buy.</li>
    <li> The power button broke after a single use, it will no longer turn off without the safety plug inserted. To make things even worse, the blade fell apart after switching it out for one of the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the type of quality I expect from cheap knockoffs, I will never trust the Wahl brand again.</li>
    <li> great clippers i have had almost no problems with them except i changed out the heads and kinda buggered them up a little bit but i think that was more operator error then a quality thing im happy with them and still use it to this day</li>
    <li> Great product design, cuts well only gripe is that some of the trimming guides are hard to attach.</li>
    <li> The first one I purchased was extremely difficult to shut off. I promptly returned it for a replacement. The replacement ran perfectly fine until today. Now, approx. 11 months later, it will not move the blades and no longer cuts....it appears the spindle no longer rotates. I would rate this 5 stars if it lasted longer. I am trying to get a replacement under the 5 year warranty.</li>
    <li> Great beard trimmer and booming tool.  Well built.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product i had i before and now i have again.best one on the market.</li>
    <li> It costs more but is worth it.  The quality is much better than my old Wahl and the attachments are exchangeable so I&#x27;ve got spares - I actually prefer the old design for the ear/nose trimmer and mini electric shaver.  The new battery technology noticeably extends time between charging.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas (2013) and it was by far the best decision I could make in terms of beard trimmers. If you are looking for a high quality beard trimmer for all shapes and sized of beards, this one is a must!  FIrst of all it&#x27;s a Wahl, which in my boyfriend&#x27;s opinion (along with all of the men in his family) is the best there is - it&#x27;s sturdy, good looking, has a million attachments for every trimming need under the sun, and it&#x27;s high quality.  Just feeling the weight of it in your hand is enough to know it&#x27;s the real deal.  He absolutely loves it and has had zero problems with it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for the bearded beauty in your life!  5 stars!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay. It doesn&#x27;t give me the close trim that I expected. I only use it when I&#x27;m out of the country on different voltage.</li>
    <li> I have tried 4 or 5 different cordless clippers over the past few years and this one is the best by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Solid stainless steel housing, really nice overall quality&lt;br /&gt;- Quality blades that trim well&lt;br /&gt;- Nice assortment of attachments, blades, nose trimmer, etc.&lt;br /&gt;- Holds a charge a long time&lt;br /&gt;- Charges quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Stainless housing gives a solid look, but it a little slippery to hold onto. I preferred the rubbery coating of the previous Wahl trimmer I had&lt;br /&gt;-  After 2 years of continuous use, it just died on me, won&#x27;t take a charge anymore.  I guess that&#x27;s about the expected life of a rechargeable battery though.  I always feel it&#x27;s a shame to have to throw away a perfectly good, device just because you can&#x27;t replace the battery when it dies.  Such is the fate of a cordless device with a fixed battery.</li>
    <li> very reliable and strong razor.</li>
    <li> Great item, well made and a very long lasting charge.  Would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;All the attachments are great.  Worth the money</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised on how well it works. All the attachments are graet.</li>
    <li> Its really the best machine i have ever used, it does not cut the skin and is used for all purposes</li>
    <li> I liked this so much, after trimming my  husband&#x27;s hair,  I purchased another one to trim my West Highland terrier&#x27;s fur.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer. The different blades that come with it are easy to attach and detach. And the fact that you can plug it anywhere in the world makes it perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> I love it. Great build quality and darn powerful. Nose hair trimmer isn&#x27;t the best, but hardly worth complaining about.</li>
    <li> I have had a number of Wahl hair cutting devices.  They are strong performers with some motor heft behind their ability to cut hair.  I have used a plug in model to cut the hair on my head and trim other body hair.  That trimmer tends to work really well on head and beard hair but less so on body hair.  Two problems led me to purchase this current &amp;#34;All in One Groomer&amp;#34;--one, I wanted to be able to work without being plugged in which means I have to stand near an outlet usually in the bathroom and make a body hair mess on the floor; two, I wanted closeness without fear of cutting too close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this All in One, my problems were solved.  Charging the battery was no problem.  Cordless, I can stand in the shower (or outside) and shave off chest hair.  Clean-up is easier and my mess is isolated.  Be reminded that this product is NOT WATERPROOF, and is not supposed to be used while taking a shower or with shaving cream.  The cutting action is clean, and very smooth.  Smoother than the plug-in model I have been using.  There are few concerns with cutting around sensitive areas, like nipples (or others!).  The raw blade (without a length guide present) does not bite, and so allows a bit more freedom to cut closer than you may have in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of length guides going all the way down to 3 mm, and the trimmer works great for those close cut facial hair beards.  In addition you can change the primary blade to a nose hair trimmer, and two other blades for closer more detailed cuts (less wide).  Appearance wise, the shiny stainless exterior combined with a bit if weight provide for great handling and balance during use.  The groomer comes with a nice carry bag, charger, the attachments, along with a cleaning brush and lubricating oil for razor maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there are some things that pull a star off the overall rating, it would be the lack of a charging or counter top stand and a slightly hard to push power button.  No matter, this is a great product and one I would recommend and hope to keep using years into the future.atter, this is a great product and one I would recommend and hope to keep using years into the future.</li>
    <li> Nice feel and design but mine inexplicably would not shut off.  Very annoying. Buzzed all over the sink area...&lt;br /&gt;Returned it only after I managed to locate the little red plastic pin (it comes with) to stop the madness.</li>
    <li> Nice design and works well.</li>
    <li> out performs all I&#x27;ve used before including other Wahl&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Trims very well. Would but again but I think it will outlast me.</li>
    <li> Trimmer seems to work fine. Very disappointed in the cheap Chinese made attachments. Come on! If your going to make a halfway decent trimmer at least put some quality into the attachments. They are total junk. One broke the first time I used it. I already spent $80 on this, I would been happy to spend another $20 for quality attachments.</li>
    <li> Nice feel  a little tough to turn on and off.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice model.  I&#x27;ve had it for a year now and love the quality and performance.  I had an inexpensive, plastic model before and it worked but not well. I highly recommend this stainless steel model.</li>
    <li> unfortunately it is missing a mustache size attachment that was part  and parcel of my first one which I lost.</li>
    <li> I tried the best shaving machine</li>
    <li> It works great. My husband loved it. Great product.</li>
    <li> спасибо большое за ОЧЕНЬ быструю доставку, 5 дней! батарея не разряжена, бреет замечательно! рекомендую.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the very fast delivery, only 5 days from US to Rus! the battery is not discharged. trimmer shaves wonderful! recommend for all.</li>
    <li> I have had three Wahl all-in-one groomers in the past three years to trim my head and mustache, and all have failed in exactly the same way.  The basic issue is that the large &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; trimming blade will very quickly come to a point of no longer cutting hair.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the blade becoming dull, or the spring that holds the two cutting surfaces together losing some resilience.  But after several uses, the blade will begin to tug rather than cut hair.  Then it will cut unevenly.  Eventually it will just sort of pass through the hair, occasionally getting stuck.  I have cleaned the blade, oiled it, and even disassembled it and run it across a sharpening stone with no change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this specific model up because Wahl brags of it being stainless.  I thought that might imply better blades as well.  But the cutting blades are exactly the same as the ones in the 9854-600 set (the set I previously owned two of), and they fail just as quickly.  Further, this groomer is supposed to be built to allow rinsing the blade in water to clean, but any time water dripped down from the blade into the groomer, I couldn&#x27;t turn the groomer off.  I suspect water was leaking into the cheap push button on/off switch, preventing me from turning off the groomer until the water inside dried up.  And to top it off, the motor in this groomer seemed to run more slowly than the motor in the 9854-600.  It always tugged at the hair on my head and barely made it through 10 shavings before the blades began cutting unevenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m done with Wahl&#x27;s personal grooming products.  I thought the ground (rather than stamped) blades would truly be an asset, but my experience shows that my cheap Remington with the stamped blades does just as well, if not better, than any of the three Wahl trimmers I have owned.  And it does so for half the price.</li>
    <li> Obviously high quality with a nice feel but, comes up short with attachments.  The clip on attachments leave something to be desired.</li>
    <li> Tried the cheap TV crud. Finally wised up and got my Wahl 9818. I have always hated shaving. Now trimming my beard is no big deal. Just need the right tool for the job.</li>
    <li> I have had the Wahl Trimmer for a little under a year. I only use it once a week to trim my beard, and the first month I had it the smaller razor attachment didn&#x27;t sound right, and then the spring or \\&quot;holder\\&quot; just broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razors are not as well built as what the body of the trimmer feels like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to those that have other Wahl trimmers, I know it sounds obvious, but make sure you use the correct charger or it will not hold a good charge. The parts may fit, but doesn&#x27;t hold well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this thing is great for what I need. I have been using Wahl trimmers for the last 15 years, and they have all been great for the first few years.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that these trimmers are terrific! The battery lasts seemingly forever, and the heads change out very easy making cleanup a snap. There really isn&#x27;t anything bad I can say about this trimmer itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I wish they had included a more variable type trim guard. I mainly use this to trim my beard, and I find that the #1 is too close, but the #2 is a bit longer than I like. Of course, the quality of the travel case isn&#x27;t the greatest, but who cares! The trimmers have a very solid feel to them, the battery is great, it&#x27;s easy to clear, and it cuts hair!</li>
    <li> This is a sturdy, powerful, and well-built trimmer. I wish I had gotten this one last time I was in the market. I have always just ran out and got a cheap plastic trimmer for $15 or so. And repeat every 2 years or so. I finally decided to break down and buy a good quality trimmer. I expect this one to last many years. The battery life is excellent, it charges quickly and even if I do manage to let the battery drain, it works while plugged in, unlike most cheap units. After years of using under-powered trimmers, I can&#x27;t believe how much power this one has. It&#x27;s also a bit heavy, in a good way. It feels solid and just has a good feel about it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for a while now, and I have to say it is magnificent. It shaves incredibly close considering it&#x27;s not actually \\&quot;shaving\\&quot;. I trim my neck with this in the mornings, and don&#x27;t even bother using a razor afterwards. All the attachments are great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing about it is how cool it looks... I like to just have it sitting on the counter to look at, ha. It&#x27;s incredibly sturdy and well built, too, you can really feel the quality. I noticed some of the other reviews mentioned an iffy power switch, but I&#x27;ve found it to be perfect - no problems here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removing and replacing the plastic trimmer attachments also works like a charm. I found them to be of normal, decent quality. The only con I can think of for the whole thing is that some of the length attachments fit slightly loose, so they rattle, but it didn&#x27;t affect the trim length, or cause any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, 100 percent recommended!</li>
    <li> Damn thing would not turn turn off after one use and then randomly turn on. In the middle of night it would just turn on like it was possessed. I contact their support line and they asked me to just send it in with out any real instructions. I did not feel that I should have to figure out the packaging, pay shipping, and then hope it got back to me. Probably should have sent it to the Ghost Hunters people for a exorcism but I returned it instead.</li>
    <li> says you can fade with this, but nearly impossible to fade with this.  wish i could return</li>
    <li> The Wahl 9818 Lithium Ion Beard &amp; Mustache Trimmer appears to be a well quality built trimmer, but looks can be deceiving! There are three main faults which I thought were important  to this model. #1) The motor lacks power, but does seem to last long enough to get the job done. A more powerfull motor would be fitting. #2) The power ON/OFF switch has some major issues ( often hard to switch on, and even harder to shut off ). Could have a much better quality switch. #3) The charger plug base on the trimmer effects the unit turning on at times when plugging in your charger or unplugging it (  don&#x27;t lose that little plastic plug that&#x27;s in the base when you receive it, you&#x27;ll need that for traveling to prevent the trimmer from turning on &amp; draining your lithium ion battery! ) For such a good quality LOOKING trimmer, you&#x27;d think it would have much better ENGINEERING!!</li>
    <li> Works great right out of the box.</li>
    <li> i received this item 6 days before it&#x27;s scheduled drop off so that&#x27;s one huge plus!  this wahl all in one is awesome, it does everything that most other units cannot and then some.  the fact that it takes 1 hour to charge to get 4 hours of usage and there&#x27;s a quick charge of 1 minute that gets you like 10 minutes of usage.  it gives clean and precise cuts along with the fact that you can wash the blades under water just makes it that much easier!</li>
    <li> Very solid and pleasing to wield. I love all the atachments that it comes with. They didn&#x27;t do the best job of describing all the attachments that are included but every length shave is in there. Its a nice complete package.</li>
    <li> As described, great product.</li>
    <li> After using this shaver for the past month I can truly say this has surpassed my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I use the shaver everyday and I have only charged it twice, once the day I opened the package and about three weeks later.  All my attachments from my previous Wahl razor work fine with this unit.  I even kept the storage tray from my old unit.  It does not come with a foil shaver but the one from the previous series works great.  It does however have a foil trimmer which I have found very useful on my neck line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storage bag is useful for items not regularly used.</li>
    <li> Great lamp for reading. Wish it were available with rechargeable batteries so it would be more convenient.</li>
    <li> made in usa nice product</li>
    <li> The base product is well designed and has the look and feel of a professional clipper.  My first question came with the multiple attachments that appears they will allow you to trim anything including the dog and a small child.  I found the instructions to be lacking and it took longer than it should to determine what attachment was for what - there are many that I still don&#x27;t have a clue what they&#x27;re for.  My main goal for this product is to trim my beard and so far its working well, but I expect it to get better as I gain experience&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My question is the quality of the plastic attachments and that is why only time will tell.  They are quite small and in my opinion flimsy.  I have had some difficulty with attaching and removing them from the clipper - obviously I am doing something wrong, but I don&#x27;t know what and this an area where the instructions are inadequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I am still in the \\&quot;getting use to\\&quot; mode and I hope that with practice today&#x27;s questions will be resolved.  If so then this product is a good value&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update September 2013:  In the original review I stated \\&quot;only time will tell\\&quot; about the quality of this product and that time is now.  I have narrowed the multiple plastic attachments down to just a few that are useful and are all that I need.  The problem is with the main unit.  Sometimes the uit will not work at all - it has been plugged into the charger for hours and when I press he start button nothing happens. I am unable to get the unit to turn on.  I will put it back on the charger and in a couple of hours it may work fine or then again maybe not.  This startwed happening a few months ago and it getting progressively worse. I have changed the charging location and - nothing changes - sometime it works and other time it is dead.  I have carefully cleaned the unit every time I use it because just a slight amount of hair will shut it down.  I have been told that this is a common problem with Wahl units.  While the unit has not stopped working entirely the fact that it works only its schedule and not mine is frustrating and unacceptable.  I will call Wahl and see how they handle this problem - I&#x27;ll let you know what they say</li>
    <li> A work of functional art. Getting the attachments on and off is not perfect - thus 4 stars but the best i have ever had for the job.</li>
    <li> First off lets talk about the positive.  The battery for one, lasts forever.  I have had the trimmer for the past 9 months and it has needed to be charged twice. That is with me trimming for about 45 min each week (its a long time because I have exceptionally thick facial hair that takes a long time to get all the little spots). It is a much higher quality trimmer than any other I have used in the past compared to those cheep plastic things, you know the ones I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately there is a decent amount of bad for me as well.  When I first bought it and used it, it would not shut off. And I mean for anything.  I turned it on at the hotel, used it and it ran until two days later when I brought it back to the store as defective.  I was undeterred because of the great trim I got, but there is problem number one. Number two has to do with the blades rusting.  I have never brought the blades near water and clean and oil them weekly, but they are rusting just the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love this trimmer only because the rest of them on the market are absolute !@#$. It may be the best out there right now, but it has its fair share of problems sadly.</li>
    <li> The only bad thing of this is the battery I was waiting for a real long use battery (4 hours) but is not that long. Everything else is just great!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with beard trimmers, but this one does exactly what I expected it to do...trimmed my beard down to the stubbly look I was going for.  Didn&#x27;t feel like it was pulling any hairs, cut smoothly, runs quietly, charges quickly.  Recommended buy.</li>
    <li> My trimmer simply won&#x27;t turn off. To prevent the trimmer from running non-stop i have to leave the charger connected to it. The item it self looks nice and has a good weight to it but the faulty power button is a huge turn off and I can&#x27;t recommend this item to anyone because of it.</li>
    <li> Bought this groomer 6 month ago. I thought paying more for a product means getting higher quality. I was dead wrong. After 6 month this trimmer does not hold a charge and it is dead. I called customer service and they told me to mail it to them (at my own expense) so they can fix it. Honestly, I do not want to waste any more money on this product. It is a piece of garbage. This was the first time and definitely the last time I will ever buy anything made by Wahl.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is sleek, quiet and works great.</li>
    <li> ***Update*** 5/11/15 After the warranty work the clippers have worked, besides the blades rusting together between each use so you have to give them a nudge to start moving again, until today! This morning the clippers decided to turn themselves back on after I was done using them. Just sitting on the counter they turned on. That&#x27;s funny more than frustrating, but the bad part is that they wouldn&#x27;t shut off. No matter how many times or ways you hit the button, they don&#x27;t shut off. The only way I found to get it to stop was to plug it into the charger. I&#x27;ll update if this results in a warranty claim, but I&#x27;m seriously considering taking this thing target shooting at this point and moving onto another brand.   Just as others have noted the button stopped working. I&#x27;ve only had the clippers for a few months so far. The other item is that a metal spring in the clipper head just fell out when I changed from the clippers to the nose hair trimmer. I looked and it hadn&#x27;t just fallen out, but the spring actually broke. I&#x27;ve only used the clippers 8 or 9 times in total!!!  The battery life is amazing, but at this point I would have been better off with a set of cheapo clippers from the drugstore.  Now, on to the customer service of Wahl. I emailed and called them and received a reply within 24 hours saying they&#x27;d send a new clipper head... They completely ignored the first part of my email where I said the button doesn&#x27;t work so the entire unit is useless. I replied to their email from &amp;#34;Amy in Customer Service&amp;#34; within a couple minutes of receiving it. Another 24 hours later I received a reply that said, &amp;#34;Sorry you are having issues, please ship it to us.&amp;#34; With an address. No return label, no other info. So now I guess I&#x27;ll be growing my beard out for a few weeks while I pay for shipping this very pretty little Lithium Ion brick back to Wahl. Not happy, not impressed. I&#x27;ll buy a cheap corded one next time. Or maybe soon if I get tired of waiting for Wahl to make this right.</li>
    <li> Beautiful unit which does the job expertly.  I shipped to Australia at about half the cost of a local unit and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my Wahl 9854-600 Lithium Ion trimmer. The battery on that one would no longer hold a charge after approximately 4 years (maybe longer). So I decided to splurge a little a get this one. Its beautifully built. Sleak, all satinless steel body with a lighted, push-button power switch. The light on the button tells you when the battery is charged or needs charging. The various interchangeable heads are easily switched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am not satisfied. The trimmer frequently pulls at my facial hair. I also have to move the trimmer over my skin in a downwards motion to get a close and somewhat comfortable trim. If I move the trimmer upwards, it pulls and does not cut close to the skin. My last trimmer, the cheaper trimmer, cut very well. Never had a problems with pulling and I could move it upwards and get a very close shave/trim. The head of this new trimmer is flawed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another downfall. A fairly big one in my opinion. This trimmer cannot be used while its plugged in. As soon as anything is inserted into the pin hole on the bottom of the trimmer, it is diabled. It comes with a plastic \\&quot;travel plug\\&quot; already inserted to prevent it from turning on in transit. This is very frustrating for me. It supposedly has a \\&quot;quick charge\\&quot; function, but I&#x27;ve no idea how its supposed to work. Besides, when im rushing for work in the morning, no charge is quick enough anyway. My last trimmer operated while plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my Third WAHL trimmer. This is the only one that I haven&#x27;t liked 100%. My first two trimmed my very rough beard with no problems at all. This one disappoints. If you are considering this one, try the WAHL 9854-600 instead. It works VERY well and its cheaper.</li>
    <li> Very good! Use it for all my trimming needs.  Much better than the cheap imitations.</li>
    <li> quality, long life, sleak design, no snags or cuts, great razor spread gets my sideburns in one stroke! would buy again</li>
    <li> Nice product. Bought it for 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.Works perfect. Would buy from Wahl again.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well, i use it for all over manscaping, i put the smalls clip on and go to town. Don&#x27;t want the shaved look but don&#x27;t want to be overly hairy. Works great on my beard and downstairs, areas that you can&#x27;t tackle with just a razor. It looks sleek, comes with many attachments and bag and charge lasts a while. however i noticed hair does get inside and under the razor but that is removable</li>
    <li> I have bough this to replace one I had before and dropped .... but the power button on this second one is a little faulty which is disappointing, and did not come with the same number of blades so could be that I bought a different package - of course the 1 blade I was really after is one that is not included. (My first one is a little worn out and it too had been dropped a few times too many). Otherwise I am still pretty happy with it as I have not seen or found anything else on the market that can compete yet!&lt;br /&gt;Its still cheaper to go through a few of these every few years than visiting the barber or hairdresser every two weeks!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - Easy to use, battery lasts a long time, convenient to travel with, provides neat and clean cuts&lt;br /&gt;Cons - shape is not that comfortable to hold and takes getting used to when using it on yourself, blades can come apart easily if dropped and replacements when required are expensive by comparison to a new set</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I just gee a goatee and a friend of mine recommended this trimmer.  It has exceeds my expectations. Providing all of the components to trim and shave my beard. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> made in the USA! Great product</li>
    <li> Great product however was not aware that the item would not come with an Australian supported adaptor.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, but as a lot of people purchase items here, I thought they should be aware of my experience. Upon initial usage, it worked perfectly. Attachments are secure and easy to use. BUT, after about 2 weeks of using the trimmers they started smoking. I&#x27;m not sure what went wrong with them.</li>
    <li> YES, I am serious. I used it once for maybe a minute and the next time I go to use it you can&#x27;t turn it off. At least when my other Wahl items broke you could turn it off and it just wouldn&#x27;t turn back on. This one just doesn&#x27;t turn off and you can hear that stupid noise all day!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl makes the worst electric razors. The blades rust after 3 uses. Seriously I have to return this thing less than 4 days after buying it b/c it already broke.&lt;br /&gt;I finally thought I was getting an updrade from the other Wahl products, but turns out you are just pay $15 more just for the looks and same technology, well actually worst b/c the touch button doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;The other Wahl electric razor I bought had a 3yr warranty and all 4 of the ones I had broke within 2 months (each used less than 15 times). Their items don&#x27;t last. All I do is dip the attachment in water, but Wahl makes sh*t @$$ electric razors&lt;br /&gt;I now have to go to bed with that annoying constant noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SAVE YOUR MONEY AND NEVER BUY WAHL PRODUCTS!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> i had a cheap groomer before ($25).  this is much better, feels more sturdy and powerful.  battery has good life and attachments are plentyful.</li>
    <li> I have tried many brands and models of trimmers but the Wahl is by far the best constructed and highest quality I have found. It comes with all the attachments necessary to stay well groomed. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been needing a new beard trimmer for quite a while, and finally decided to spend the extra money for a &gt;$15 trimmer. My main requirements were that it have a lithium-ion battery and quality blades. In these respects, this trimmer is exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the trimmer is sleek and solid! It is well built and feels very sturdy; no cheap plastic housing here. The same goes for all of the metal attachments. Both of the comb blades work well and haven&#x27;t yanked my hair out yet, and are pretty quiet compared to other trimmers I&#x27;ve owned. The detail shaver is so-so, but that style of blade has never worked well on my thick beard, and probably works great for those with lighter hair. The nose trimmer is awesome and cuts without tugging on sensitive hair (which really hurt with cheaper trimmers!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life has been great so far. I haven&#x27;t run it down to empty without charging it first, but I&#x27;ve gotten 4-5 shaves without plugging it in and not even a low-battery light. If I did run it low and was in desperate need of a charge, it&#x27;s comforting to know that the li-ion battery could &#x27;quick charge&#x27; and run within a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint lies with the plastic attachments. Several of them (but not all) are clearly marked &#x27;China&#x27;, which is hugely disappointing to me. When I buy a product advertised as being &#x27;Made in the USA&#x27;, I expect it to be just that. I can believe that the trimmer itself was made here, given its quality, but it does make me question Wahl. The product packaging states: \\&quot;Made in USA, Printed in China\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer doesn&#x27;t come with any sort of base or stand, so it won&#x27;t be standing on your bathroom counter as a decoration. This also means no storage for the many attachments (besides the travel bag), but that&#x27;s what drawers are for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Excellent construction and &#x27;feel&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Plenty of attachments&lt;br /&gt;No ripping or tearing hair out (even nose hairs)&lt;br /&gt;Lithium-ion battery&lt;br /&gt;Quiet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not entirely made in the USA&lt;br /&gt;No base/stand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this trimmer, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. It doesn&#x27;t replace a double-edge safety razor for a clean shave, especially for thick hair, but it&#x27;s great for quick shaves or chopping a bunch of hair off at once.</li>
    <li> This is not what I accepted to buy I thought it was better than that</li>
    <li> Clipper worked great for 9 months.  Then the On/Off stopped working and contacted Wahl to have it fixed/replaced under the warranty.  Was told to send mine in and it would be addressed.  Almost 3 weeks later, I contact Wahl and am told without a shipping/tracking number they cannot look up to see if they received my defective unit yet, and that my name is not in their system yet.  I was told it may be sitting in their receiving department but they are backed up and have no idea when it may be taken care of.  For this poor showing of customer service they get 3 stars.  I could have paid for entire new clipper with the haircuts I have paid for in the waiting period.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver, great build quality and it comes with quite an impressive range of guides.  It is very easy to use and the battery life is great.  It would have been great to have a stand thrown in as well, but that is a very minor point since it comes with a pouch to store it in.  It can be quite messy using it to trim your beard though, but that is the case with any trimmer that doesnt have a pouch or some other function to capture the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I woul definately recommend this.</li>
    <li> Piece of crap. First use I made 2 passes over my beard and it yanked out more hairs than it cut. Already in the garbage. I do not recommend, my 15 year old norelco does a better job.</li>
    <li> Recently purchased, so far I can say that it feels very well built.  The individual attachments and guides all snap in firmly and are easy to clean.  The trimming is very comfortable and the battery is amazing compared to my last trimmer. All together, I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Hard as heck to turn off and on. It pulls my hair a lot.</li>
    <li> It lasted about 4 months before it stopped working.  Even when it did work, the on/off button didn&#x27;t always work.  I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second one now. The first one would not shut off correct. I had to push the button extremely hard or plug the charging cable in to shut it off. When you get it wet, the power button does not work properly. With my second one, I made sure not to get it wet. I just use the included brush or compressed air, and not it works great!</li>
    <li> It is smaller than I thought but does a great job.</li>
    <li> After 35 years of shaving, I decided to wear a beard (rather than just allowing one to grow out as a result of backpacking for a month).  I liked the look, but was ready to ditch it because it was such a pain to groom it with my nose pressed against a mirror while trying to line up one of those mini grooming devices.  As a last effort, I splurged and bought this.  The beard stays!  I have no idea how long the battery lasts, mostly because grooming takes just a few seconds.  Snap off the length attachment, and neatening up the outer contours to create crisp lines takes just a few more seconds.  Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Overall great, just wish there was an additional guard size between the No. 1 and No. 2.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and very close with no guard. I really never use a razor on my neck anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Fairly quiet, nice feel in the hand. Very quality construction. Charge keeps for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be an easy 5 stars if there was more short blades around the 4 to 5mm length... (I keep a short beard, and currently it works alright using a No. 1 and a No. 2, but wish I had a little more options in between the two).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone knows where/how to get blades in between No. 1 and 2, I would really like to know.</li>
    <li> I purchased this time in July of 2013. A few months after the purchase, I noticed the following problems:&lt;br /&gt;• The clippers became difficult to turn and turn off.&lt;br /&gt;• The clippers never seemed to be able to obtain/hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have taken that as a bad omen, because today, September 1, 2014, I tried to turn on the clippers, but it failed to do so (even though the clippers had been  charged for the last 2 days.  Repeated attempts to charge it failed. What a waste of 70 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed at the quality of workmanship and product performance.&lt;br /&gt;I expected a product with the WAHL name to last more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;Based on this experience I probably will never get a Wahl product again.</li>
    <li> Product comes with lots of attachments and works great for grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I have found is that if even a drop of water gets down into the unit, you can&#x27;t turn the machine off and you can&#x27;t remove the batteries.  Just keep this in mind when using the product and keep it far away from water.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer, great battery life. I only gave it four stars because the on/off button is cumbersome to use. This is a solid piece, has good weight and feel.</li>
    <li> I chose this trimmer for the battery life but it has served me well in all other respects. I only wish I had a few more trimming sizes, especially for very short trims, but otherwise, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Compact but sturdy. Has enough attachments for every trimming need. I have not had it very long to rate the battery life.</li>
    <li> Long battery life. Nice and compact.</li>
    <li> There is a reason why everyone compares other similar products to a wahl… this is a remarkably satisfying beard trimmer to use. It is solid and well-built. The blades are sharp and well made. If you are looking for a fashionable, zoomy, sports-car-like trimmer, look elsewhere. If you are concerned with a good product and a good trim, this is your beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> Upon buying this, I didn&#x27;t realize that I was separating myself from the world of fussy, cheaply made in China shavers that would make my shaving routine a burden.  Fire this up and you&#x27;ll feel like your getting a professional shave.  It&#x27;s solid, doesn&#x27;t pull at your hair and the beard guides really comb through your hair and cut it all evenly.  It also comes with a carrying case that holds all of the accessories and a translucent plastic stand (don&#x27;t believe that was mentioned in the description).  I will never go back to the cheap all-in-one shavers that require replacement after a year.  At the current price ($25 cheaper than Best Buy), this is a steal!</li>
    <li> What a huge disappointment! Would not shut off, large blade would not cut. I definitely will send this back and never buy a Wahl product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on replacement;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement unit sent from Wahl worked perfectly. Wahl&#x27;s customer service is very impressive. I expected nothing from them, yet they insisted in sending me a new trimmer. I would recommend this product, if you have issues, they will stand behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Colleen and Wahl.</li>
    <li> The quality of this trimmer is apparent the instant you remove it from the package.  It is very solid in its construction; it is heavy compared to others because of its metal body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base that comes with it to stand it upright while charging is plastic, a let down.  I don&#x27;t use it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor sounds spectacular.  It runs with a subtle hum, like the high end professional trimmers at your barber shop.  It did not whine or strain when I trimmed my beard that had grown to 2 inches in length.  It is very impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item to consolidate multiple devices into one convenient package and it will easily replace my separate nose hair and beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The majority of the guards are for the wide trimmer attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads change with ease and it does not appear that repeated changing poses a risk of breaking any during the process.  There are no plastic tabs that hold them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guards attach via plastic tabs that stretch over nubs on the trimmer, its only visible weak point.  It is possible that these may break in the future.  This is a standard method of attachment of guards for most trimmers anyway.  I am unaware if guards can be purchased separately from Wahl if they happen to break in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a red plastic plug you insert into the charging port to disable the trimmer so it cannot be turned on while in luggage or during transport.  It made it all the way from Atlanta to South Dakota with a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All blades came lubricated and it is ready to use once you take it out of the package and charge it.  It will not run while plugged into AC power.  I was disappointed by this, but the charge rate and battery life make up for it, so it is not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I&#x27;m impressed by this trimmer overall.  I&#x27;ve owned several less expensive devices and I regret not buying one of these to begin with.  It appears to be a great quality product, built to last, and consisting of higher end components.</li>
    <li> This groomer does was it advertises. A great weight and build that makes your proud of the money you spent on it. Not overtly heavy though as I&#x27;m thankful for this purchase. I still can&#x27;t find myself going away from the plug in Wahl professional style razors I use to trim my hair (with a 1 guard).</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not what I expected no sharp edges it doesn&#x27;t worth to buy and the funny thing is when I write my review I have to put a star hhhhhhh</li>
    <li> Solid, well-built - AMERICAN MADE!  Love this trimmer.  Appropriate for haircuts or beard/body trimming.  I would highly recommend this product.  The cordless feature is what I was looking for, and it&#x27;s sleek and stylish looking.  Feels solid in your hand.  Battery lasts a long time.  I have used it several times and have yet to recharge it.  Wahl makes a great product!</li>
    <li> So far so good.  About one month of ownership at this point, and the trimmer has worked flawlessly, with none of the issues reported by others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:  lots of attachments, great battery life, Wahl blade quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:  none so far.</li>
    <li> Has all the attachments i&#x60;ve been wanting ... I like the cordless feature...  After trying it I bought a second one and gave it as a Christmas present..</li>
    <li> good range of clipper sizes. Can do face or haircut. I use mine to trim my face, and sideburns. The battery is awsome, stays charged forever and charges in a few mins.</li>
    <li> I had many trimmers die on me early which is really annoying. Thats why I found the Lithium-Ion battery so appealing because it will retain its charge longer. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Extremely well made, but just not enough power from the electric motor. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Battery lasts for a long time and does a great job.</li>
    <li> High quality buzzer ... Battery last multiple trims</li>
    <li> I have another Wahl clipper that the finish was getting somewhat worn. It was the rubbery finish. I love the 9818 much better due to the Lithium Ion battery and the Stainless Steel finish. I have had this several months and have only had to charge a couple times. I have had no problems with it at all. This is not really a problem but it does not come with any type of stand, but I stand it in a corner on my sink so it doesn&#x27;t get knocked over.</li>
    <li> If it stays as it should, i will be enjoying this for a long time. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> My first one lasted a year and died.  I didn&#x27;t mind, I used it often and felt I got enough use for the price.  It worked well.  The second one came without the blade I used the most. Very disappointed.  But shortly after I started using it the on off switch became difficult and unpredicable.  I sometimes spend 5-6 minutes to get it to turn on.  Then it my turn off for no reason.  Quality seemed to take a dive.  I wouldn&#x27;t dare buy a third.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer long lasting charge</li>
    <li> I have two tiny 5 lb Yorkies that I groom myself during the summer because I keep them clipped rather short.  Living in the South I try to keep them as cool as possible.  This clipper is the perfect size for that.</li>
    <li> This product stopped working after less than 90 days. It won&#x27;t charge or turn on any more and of course the return policy is over.</li>
    <li> Used it maybe 2 or 3 times, when it worked it was nice.  Then one day, about 2 weeks after owning it, it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on, even when plugged into charger it wouldn&#x27;t charge.  Complete paperweight, junk!  I should have trusted all the reviews I saw about this thing stopping working.</li>
    <li> Great product. The blades get dull after a while of use on beard and coarse hair but still cuts well. The battery lasts forever (not literally of course, but a long time). Very nice trimmer with lots of attachments.</li>
    <li> Nearly perfect.  Only complaint is that the charging plug does not snap into the connector securely on the bottom of the shaver.  One has to insert the plug and then be careful not to jog the cable or the shaver, otherwise the plug will slip out of the bottom of the shaver and (obviously) stop charging.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Small, made in the USA, and has plenty of power. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product but a serious design flaw causes the product not to cut hair at the proper length.  I own the 9236 plug-in clipper and the 9864 trimmer so i wanted to upgrade to the this lithium ion.  I need to trim my facial hair to 1mm so i would use the #1 guide trim.  The problem is the guide comb does not fit flush against the trimmer.  The trimmer has these raised edges along the side of the chrome surface that causes this problem.  To get the proper 1mm cut, I had to cut the plastic guide comb to accommodate the raised edges of the chrome surface.  I find this really unaccepted since the main purpose is to cut hair accurately.  After a few weeks of use, I love the power and battery length of the trimmer.  I would suggest purchasing the less expensive 9854-600 lithium trimmer over this one as i don&#x27;t believe this trimmer would have the fit issue.</li>
    <li> Update....I change my rating of this product to a five-star now because the company did make amends for the lost money order. I want to thank them very much for what they did and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m changing my rating. I forgot I even wrote this review until I just noticed it today. So I figured I better change the rating now since I noticed it  here. I have the new head for the shaver and it works like a charm. As I say this is always been a good shaver,it was just a misunderstanding with the company.all is good and thank you again for everything!!! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review below.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to give this Shaver Kit the lowest rating I can because of the  company&#x27;s incompentency!!  First off this shaver does NOT include the foil shaver heads.  Granted, I knew that PRIOR to ordering this shaver kit .  But that wasnt the issue.  I didnt think it was going to be a problem ordering the extra heads direct from the WAHL company itself as they said I COULD with no problem!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed them and they gave me all the info that I needed to order the heads direct from them and thier prices was literally HALF the cost of what third part sellers on Amazon were selling them for.  I asked WAHL if i could send them a money order since they  DID NOT have any Amazon acount to purchase from or else i would have ordred from thier Amazon store.  But they DIDNT. so i had to send them a money order!.  As i say they gave me all the information to order them.. SO i sent them a money order on NOVEMBER 8th. Money order was purchased on the 8th and sent out same day!.It was total of 20.95 for two heads and shipping cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now mind you this letter only had to go from Northern NY to Conneticut.  The letter was supposedly delivered  with in that week. But they litterally LOST it in thier company. It has been OVER a MONTH now and it still has NOT been cashed as of yet ...so I guess that shouldnt be an issue, right? .. It isnt like i am out the money ..... But YEAH  in away i am because i called the place i got the money order from and they said that it will cost me 15$  initital fee  to get a refund.  So all i would be getting back is $5.95&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to me that is NOT worth it at all!!!  But a friend of mine said he WOULD actually get the refund just to be satisfied that the money order wasnt going to be cashed later from someone at WAHL company and pocketing it.  Granted he made a  VERY GOOD point because WHO knows what they would do once i completely write it off and forgot all about it.  Boom they cash it and put the 20 bucks in thier pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here&#x27;s the clicker, i would have to get YET ANOTHER money order for the initial of $15 just to send back to the actuall HQ of the Money Order Company just to get a refund and stop payment on the first money order!!!.. Yeah and watch that one get lost too???  Now I ask you all.... what would you do?!?!  I guess someone from WAHL is making a nice $20.95 tip from me!!!</li>
    <li> I have the Wahl All-in-one lithium ion trimmer (Model #:9854-610) and this looks like the same style and design but with a stainless steel casing. If it works as well as my current one I&#x27;ll be happy because the only negative with the old one is that the casing is a little flimsy. So hopefully the new stainless steel exterior will solve the durability problem. Can&#x27;t wait to get this product in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I received the shaver today and  I am very content with the purchase in the end. As thought previously, the unit is very sturdy and durable due to the real stainless steel body. The weight of the shaver is significantly heavier than any shaver I&#x27;ve owned and it makes for a high quality and hopefully longer life-time of the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a few days so I can&#x27;t comment on reliability, but this trimmer is VERY solidly built. The Li-ion battery should way outlast my previous trimmer. Plenty of attachments were provided. Would give it 5 stars BUT there is no stand. Many cheaper models come with a charging stand (including others from Wahl). It does have a travel pouch so if this is your primary need, no worries.</li>
    <li> Almost perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no model, but when the hair stopped growing on my head and started growing out my ears, I decided to look for help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trashed my 15 year old trimmer and started my search.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted rechargeable with a narrow trimmer accessory (nostril sized since my last trimmer had that and I found it effective). This one had more than I needed, and that is reflected in the price.  Overall this trimmer is worth the price,  I didn&#x27;t want to pay so much, but I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is the on/off switch sometimes is hard to press or locate.  Sometimes I  feel that I am pressing too hard, but I am missing the button.  It is hard to explain.  Early in the morning, that extra effort to concentrate is annoying.  I wouldn&#x27;t take away a star for that though.</li>
    <li> Best all rounder for stubble look without having patchiness. It is portable enough and has variety of trim settings (not gonna use most) but may use nose trimmer perhaps in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, feels solid (think about iPhone type solidness). I have thrown away 4 other trimmers.</li>
    <li> I needed a beard trimmer and this one works just fine. I like all the extra attachments even though you have to make sure they are attached securely before getting started. As long as you are patient with it and don&#x27;t loose any of the pieces, it seems like it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the shaver attachment. I would not buy it for that.</li>
    <li> This would be a great trimmer if the off switch worked.  I read the comments and thought, &amp;#34;What&#x27;s the likelihood of that happening to more than one or two of them?&amp;#34;  Well I guess it&#x27;s pretty high!  The only way to turn it off is to leave it on the counter and let it run all day while you are at work!  Wahl makes great plug-in products but none of the three cordless products I have bought from them have worked.  Shop for something else!</li>
    <li> OK, I have to say that with this purchase, Wahl has made me a customer for life. I&#x27;ve had this unit for 7 months, and there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m giving this baby up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body is solid and heavy, much heavier than I had expected. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just that solidly made or if they have added weights, but when you pick it up, you&#x27;ll know you&#x27;re holding a very solid object. That&#x27;s not a negative, the weight actually makes it a bit easier to control in delicate trimming situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are also very sharp. You could cut yourself if you use it without a guard. After 7 months of daily use, they remain as sharp as they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lithium battery is great. NEVER get anything else. I&#x27;ve recharged this razor twice since I bought it, and once was just to be sure because it had been a long time and I was going on a trip. It doesn&#x27;t suffer from power fade and it stays charged. In a way, that&#x27;s a problem, because it goes full throttle until it literally stops. Literally. The charge LED does blink to let you know when it needs charging, but the charge lasts so long that you just don&#x27;t notice it. That one qualifies as a first world problem - my trimmer charge lasts too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: the description reads (or at least did read) that the unit includes the adjustable blade. That&#x27;s incorrect. It includes just about every size and attachment you could ever want, but it doesn&#x27;t include that accessory.  For most guys, that&#x27;s not a problem. It was for me, however. I called Wahl just to see if such an adjustable attachment was available. That&#x27;s where they hooked me forever. Ok, first, when I called the 800 number, a human being answered. I know, right? An actual human being! And they were friendly!! I didn&#x27;t know what to do. What button do you push to say hello? Anyway, I asked for customer service, and she said she would be glad to help me. No transferring me around the system? One would almost think they cared about their customers. I told her what I was looking for and what model I had, and to my surprise, she said, oh yes, they could provide that. I whipped out my credit card to purchase the attachment, and then didn&#x27;t need it. They were happy to send the part to me free of charge, and they even paid the shipping. She did apologize, however, because it wouldn&#x27;t be ready to ship for a week or so. I called back about a week later to see if it had shipped (ok, I was impatient and wanted to use my new toy). They had all the information immediately available and confirmed that it had shipped as promised. That kind of service is rare, and the unit could have fallen apart at this point and I still would have bought the next unit from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to sum up, this is a great product from a great company at a reasonable price. You would be a fool to buy anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 2015-12-29: I&#x27;ve had requests for a link to the adjustable blade Wahl sent me. I don&#x27;t have a link, but i have posted a picture so you know what&#x27;s available.her what I was looking for and what model I had, and to my surprise, she said, oh yes, they could provide that.

    <li> It worked fine for the first month or so I had it. It was nothing special and I feel that the $20 all in one trimmers did just as well but I was willing to pay a bit more for something more sleek. However about 3 months into use (I would shave roughly once a month) I noticed the trimmer blade was already broken (the shaver nor the blade were ever dropped). I had no other shaver at the time so I finished the shave with minimal injuries. I go to find replacement blades and this is where the nightmare began. First, let me tell you there are many a instruction manuals/websites out there for this item and I found that none of them could accurately reflect one another. One told me the trimmer blade was part #02143 another said it was part #02144. If you go to the Wahl website it doesn&#x27;t have either of those listed! I&#x27;m contemplating just buying another cheap all in one set like the one that lasted me a few years with no problems vs. buying a replacement wahl blade for $10+ shipping and handling. The only attachment I ever used was the 6-position trimming guide but the others seemed okay though a little on the flimsy side. Changing out the blades/attachments is pretty easy. I&#x27;m sure others will find this a great shaver/trimmer but it&#x27;s only disappointed me since it got to my door. At least amazon delivery is fast!</li>
    <li> Update:&lt;br /&gt;I discovered attachments in the box that I didn&#x27;t know were included. The default blade didn&#x27;t work for my needs, see below. I found the shaver blade attachment and it actually works, much better than any other cordless shaver I&#x27;ve tried. Swapping the blade attachments is easy--much easier than other shavers. The curved design still makes it hard to see what you are doing. I updated my review to four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer looks beautiful and feels solid. Sadly, its trimming abilities are mediocre. The blades aren&#x27;t sharp and/or fast enough so if you want a stubble look this trimmer isn&#x27;t going to do much for you. The other problem is the shape of the trimmer near the blades: the curve makes it hard to get the trimmer close enough to your skin. It does charge very fast and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> Well lets see I bought this for deployment reasons because Wahl is suppose to be a good brand. It&#x27;s not the thing will not turn off until you plug the adapter in the bottom. So now im stuck in Afghanistan with a piece of s***. I need this trimmer to maintain good hygene and of course it fails. Thanks for the crap!!! Hire a new QA for your products in the factory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOLLOWUP: I contacted Wahl directly and they got back to me in less that a day to inform me that will send a replacement trimmer free of charge. So over all Wahi stood behind their product and I&#x27;m happy with the customer support. As for the trimmer well we will see, the last one could have been a lemon.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my husband, he seems to be very pleased with it! He likes all the changeable heads. works Great</li>
    <li> Power button fails often and it turns on sometimes by itself. I called your customer care and got a machine. When I finally got a call back I missed it. I quickly returned the call and got a machine again and now they won&#x27;t call back. I&#x27;ve tried a few times and nothing.</li>
    <li> Brilliant quality and accessories!&lt;br /&gt;Might be nice to have a charging stand, but that&#x27;s being very picky.&lt;br /&gt;Great, sturdily built product!</li>
    <li> Ordered  this for my nephew for Christmas.  He picked it out and loves it.  Great gift and worth the cost..</li>
    <li> Have had this groomer for 3 months. Best I have ever owned. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I use this to maintain a beard, mustache, and buzz cut. It replaced an older Wahl trimmer with a NiMH battery, which lasted me some 5 years before wearing out, and after 6 months of use, I find that it improves on the older model in several ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The lithium-ion battery is a vast improvement. More shaves between charges, quicker charging, and no sign of the battery wear-down that I experienced with the older model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The stainless steel case is good for an unexpected reason: it doesn&#x27;t hold a static charge so, unlike the plastic cases, hair doesn&#x27;t stick to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Quieter, faster, less prone to getting choked with hair clippings, easier to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect it to last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Love this trimmer. Solid steel! Eae of use! The only negative is the cheesy holder and case that comes with it.</li>
    <li> I bought these trimmers for my boyfriend to trim his beard and shave his head. They were a lot bigger than I expected, but they work great. He really likes all the different guards and attachments it comes with. They hold their charge for a very long time, I think we have only charged them twice since buying them 4 months ago (and he uses them at least once a week.) When my boyfriend shaves his head, he does have to go over it a couple times to get the stray hairs left behind, but that is to be expected with almost all trimmers and clippers. Overall, we are both very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of other Wahl&#x27;s in the past, and this one surpasses them all.  It has a real professional feel to it.  The solid metal body is comfortable in your hands, and the clippers are well-designed and work perfectly.  They&#x27;ve added some nice features, like the light on the on/off button starts blinking when the battery is low, and there&#x27;s a button that locks the trimmer so it doesn&#x27;t accidently turn on while you&#x27;re traveling.  Only wish they still had the adjustable clipper, but even without that, this is an excellent trimmer.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Solid, lots of attachments, keeps a charge for a long time. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband. After two years, it no longer charges.</li>
    <li> Reasonably impressed with this. The LI batter is nice, it means it should never slow down as the battery drains.&lt;br /&gt;The Attachments and trimmers are actually a little flimsy; i expected them to be more metal and less plastic. The removal of the &amp;#34;heads&amp;#34; always scares me, I feel like I am going to break them.&lt;br /&gt;If there were a third party attachment system for this I would be very interested.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome trimmer with a brushed stainless finish. I have used purchased many more expensive trimmers before and have always been disappointed with the seemingly, cheap, plastic, lightweight feel.  This is just the opposite.  It&#x27;s a very heavy expensive looking trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, it doesn&#x27;t come with a charging base!  It just has a power adapter that plugs into the bottom.  Very strange...</li>
    <li> I was initially happy enough with the shaver, but after 9 months I can no longer get it to turn on. The LED still lights up briefly when I plug it in, so I know it&#x27;s alive, but even with the shaver head unattached, the power button doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially skeptical about the snap-on attachments -- they felt very flimsy -- but it turns out they were not the weakest link in the chain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll return this (Amazon return period is only 1 month for this item, but Wahl will take returns for 5 years), and spend another $40-50 on a shaver that will last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: They contacted me here (see their comment below), and offered to trade my broken unit for a new one. I called, and worked it out with them. The new unit arrived about 2 weeks later, and I shipped back the broken one. I&#x27;m bumping my review up to two stars as a result. They also asked me to take down my review, and I think that&#x27;s at least a little unethical. They could have said, \\&quot;Could you please update your review if your opinion of the shaver has changed\\&quot;, but asking me take it down is not right.</li>
    <li> Nice groomer, groomer unit itself is very nice and high quality. I like the ability to switch heads by just snapping them off and on. However, it still uses the cheap plastic clips to get the desired trim length. One of the clips broke during shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been happy with the reseller who sold this to me.</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I really like the style of this razor - looks and feels really solid.  Unfortunately it failed to work after about two months.  I would not recommend the razor even it was still working because it really lacked power - felt like it was struggling.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the &#x27;all-in-one&#x27; part. It trims my goatee acceptably (&amp;#60;&#x3D;&#x3D; in italics) but even with the right attatchments mangles it a little unless I&#x27;m careful. The nose and ear hair trimmer piece I just don&#x27;t find to be very good. I have a cheapo electric for just that purpose I used prior to buying this which would take care of any little hairs with ease, but this one seems to miss quite a few even after multiple tries. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s that weird circular head or what. Regardless, this thing does all right, but don&#x27;t expect the apotheosis of hairlessness.</li>
    <li> I love This Little Guy have not tried it yet but I will be and I will Probley get good Results Sense it&#x27;s A WahL (my Favorite Brand by The Way), I love all The Acessories it came with I&#x27;m probley not gonna use half of them though. LOL!</li>
    <li> I have used the other big brands, but Wahl is the best investment.  While the other companies use cool names, colors and gimmicks for their products, Wahl has always stuck to being more bland, but the product performance always stood out.  The 9818 has more attachments than most people will need, but the easy change heads is a great concept.  A single charge lasts and the overall weight/design is great.  My last Wahl trimmer lasted for 2 years and it was not near the quality this model is.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer kit I have ever purchased. Very precise and sharp cutting/trimming attachments.</li>
    <li> Nice clippers, made in America</li>
    <li> My wife and I really like this fine instrument. Ultra sharp with no pulling hair or chewing sensation. It&#x27;s sleek size and feel is fantastic. No more cheap immatations for us.</li>
    <li> Much better than my old clippers.  Being cordless makes cutting my own hair much easier than with the corded clippers this replaced.  I have a very thick, bull head of hair and I will sometimes have to slow down when cutting my hair in order for these to keep up.  But as long as I take my time, they work great.  The accessories seem to work well.  I was supprised at how &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; the cifferent combs (used to cut different length hair) are made - seem rather cheap compaired to the quality of the clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life has been very good.  I cut my hair about once a week and it takes me about 20 minutes to complete the task.  I have not counted the number of times I can cut my hair on a single charge, but it does seem to be quite a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase these clippers again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. He absolutely loves it! He couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This is a great little trimmer and has plenty of power and sharp blades. My main frustration is in the snap on guides mainly the #3 and #4 both the guides teeth have broken rendering them useless. I really wish they guides were made better. The shorter ones are too short to break and the longer one seem to be made with more plastic and thus do not bend and break. I use this about twice I month to cut my hair and do some trimming with no performance issues in the actual trimmer. If it were not for the guides breaking I would have rated it higher however I&#x27;m not going to sugar coat the quality and they do not live up to the wahl name.</li>
    <li> Well first of all it was noisy and pulled my hair so I opened up the blade section and found a little rock underneath. After I removed that it worked fine for everything except ear hair (too noisy for that). So it isn&#x27;t perfect but it does get the job done and is quieter than some. It holds a charge for a long time so you can do a lot of work before recharging. At one point I saw the blue light was going out and thought it wasn&#x27;t charging but it turns out that the light is only on when it is charging, and this led me to give a poor review. I apologize, my bad.  I have had this for 22 months and it is still going.</li>
    <li> I have had this trimmer for almost two years now and have had no issues with it.  It charges quickly and holds the charge for a long time.  It has a nice solid feel without being too bulky or heavy, and it has a sleek look.  It comes with all the attachments that I need (actually more as there are quite a few I have never used).  I would definitely recommend this grooming tool.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a surprise for my husband and he loves it - especially how long it holds it&#x27;s charge.</li>
    <li> These work just like they are suposed to work, a great product that is well worth the money, I love it.</li>
    <li> A smooth shaver.  No caught hairs, and no need to go back over again.  Changing the head was easier than expected.</li>
    <li> I had an earlier version of this product that just stopped working - no reason. It was not from this vendor but I was unable to get a refund. I ordered this for next day delivery. It was delivered 5 days later. If this one stops working I&#x27;ll be back to amend this review.</li>
    <li> Gave it 3 stars.  Wish it had a better stubble guide.  Already broke the plastic 6 position beard guide I ordered from Wahl.</li>
    <li> I owned this clipper for less than 3 days and used it once and it totally fall apart wow I suggest you buy something else</li>
    <li> This is a great choice for anyone, especially people who change their facial hair regularly.  It offers a wide variety of grooming options. Also, it is sturdy and stores well.</li>
    <li> A brilliant tool to use. Although I didn&#x27;t get all of the blades in my kit.&lt;br /&gt;The sheer power of the Wahl 9818 Lithium Ion Stainless Steel All-in-one Groomer is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;The sleek design of it makes it a ergonomic choice.</li>
    <li> Just bought this after being very unhappy with the purchase of the top of the line Norelco model. The Wahl is great. Perfectly even cut. It feels heavy duty. No where near as many cheap plastic parts like on the Norelco.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item February 2, 2012 and paid a little more because I thought it was better quality. Over the past year or so I have had multiple problems with the power switch where sometimes it will not turn on. It finally died completely and will not turn on in July, 2013. Again...steer clear of this until Wahl makes improvements.</li>
    <li> This is BY FAR the best electric shaver I have ever owned. I am the kind of guy who does hours upon hours of research before buying basically anything, and sometimes it takes some trial-and-error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first purchased the Andis T-Outliner since it had such great reviews. It was a beast, but not what I was looking for. If I worked at a barber shop, then I&#x27;m sure I would have loved it. But I just want a high quality electric shaver for at-home use to keep my beard tamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I returned the Andis one and got this one and I am so happy I did. This thing is very impressive. When you first hold it in your hand, you immediately notice the high quality. It is just the right weight and the stainless steel body is very sleek and sturdy. It comes with tons of clipper guards so you are sure to trim your beard to the perfect length, and fade if needed. It also has a nose hair trimmer and a close shave attachment for your neck stubble. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love Wahl products, I actually insist on purchasing ONLY Wahl razors as the other brands are cheaply made.  I really enjoy this razor after using another Wahl all in one groomer for about  3 years now.  I didn&#x27;t really need a new groomer but I wanted to purchase this model to see if it works better and it truly does!  I find that it cuts very close and clean and it feels like its easier to get hair down to a short stubble.  I really enjoy using this product and it is worth every penny!  Go Wahl!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for over 35 years and have been through dozens of trimmers....this is absolutely the best.  I trim 2-3 times a week and only have to charge the unit about every once every 6 weeks. Attachments all work excellent including the nose hair trimmer.  This one feels like it will last forever.</li>
    <li> To much trouble to turn off. Powered on with no problem. When trying to turn off, power button had to be pressed multiple times. Hate to think of the trouble it would be in a couple years when it&#x27;s operating this way right out of the box.</li>
    <li> To be their new latest model 9818, it has a very weak motor fully charged. I have been using the Wahl 9854 for 3 yrs. It blows this new one away with over twice the power and therefore speed. I thought stainleess would be best, it is not. They have the same fine blade, same accessories, but this one has stainless body that is much heavier. They would have hit a home run if it had the power of the 9854, batteries are identical. This is going right back, too bad the power button is jacked as well. Takes 3-4 times to turn it off. You need to drive your finger nail down hard on power switch to turn off. It has even shut off and came back on itself. This needs a total horse power upgrade, and easier power on/ off. Just get the Wahl 9854 and be impressed with its power, unless now it has this whimpy motor of the 9818 as well, mine is 3 yrs old.</li>
    <li> A very nice trimmer, just don&#x27;t get water anywhere near it! Only a few months later, and I have a stainless steel paperweight because a few drops of water got under the power button.  Wahl should have covered the water-sensitive electronics with silicon. I had high hopes for this trimmer, but I trimmed my beard while it was still a bit wet and now the trimmer is dead. Fifty dollars down the drain.</li>
    <li> This is.a well made product.  The on/off button is a bit small in design and hard to press.  Seems to hold a charge for a long time.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Alright. About 6 months in with this thing. I love it!finally got around to writing a review.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: it&#x27;s solid,Feels good ,still sharp, never had a charging problem, really no cons. The bag it comes in is a lil flimsy, but the actual razor rocks. Recommend it</li>
    <li> I purchased this &amp;#34;groomer&amp;#34; because I thought it would be an upgrade to the cheaper Wahl groomers I&#x27;ve used and liked very much. However, after receiving it in the mail, the power light stopped working while it was charging, which prompted me to take advantage of the manufacturer&#x27;s warranty and get a new one. After using the replacement groomer for a few weeks, the same problem emerged. Beyond this, the razor yanks and pulls at my whiskers while shaving and doesn&#x27;t seem to be as sharp and precise as the cheaper Wahl groomers I&#x27;ve used in the past. Thus, from now on I will always by Wahl&#x27;s cheaper products because, paradoxically, they seem to be built better and work better than their more expensive products. FYI.</li>
    <li> Exceptional and meets all my needs.</li>
    <li> The trimmer and battery work as advertised, NOTHING ELSE DOES... *EVERY* attachment that ships with this product has broken in less than the year I&#x27;ve owned it. Every head attachment has fallen off during a trim and destroyed its teeth against the sink as it fell. Not one remains, and this product is now entirely useless to me. I bought it as an expensive, supposedly longer lasting option, but it, like the $20 plastic bodied trimmers is a piece of crap masquerading as quality. We sent a human to the moon 50 years ago, if we can&#x27;t make a trimmer capable of lasting a year of beard trims, it&#x27;s because that&#x27;s not the manufacturer&#x27;s goal. NOTHING ABOUT THIS IS WORTH THE PRICE. Wahl just wants more of your money this year than last year for the same disposable object.</li>
    <li> This really need a changing stand or some kind of mount.  Also it&#x27;s power is a bit weak.  My older cheap rechargeable one (that is dead after one use) goes through the hair a lot faster and more cleanly.  You sort of have to go slow and be gentle with this one.  I always seem to leave hair behind uncut with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions even say to go slowly and don&#x27;t force it through the hair.  Not what I want to do when I&#x27;m in a hurry to get out the door.</li>
    <li> So far working well for beard trimming around the mouth.</li>
    <li> Very Sharp Blades. Highly Recommend this Product&lt;br /&gt;Thank You: Wahl Company  &amp; AMAZON</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a goatee or beard ever since 1995, so I&#x27;ve owned various cordless trimmers over the years.  I&#x27;ve liked the Wahl&#x27;s trimmers the best, but they have all died after 5+/- years - usually the batteries have stopped holding a charge.  I like a neat &amp; precise trim, so having to find a new trimmer I like is always a nuisance, because some permit a closer more accurate trim than others.  After reading all the reviews for the various trimmers with 4 stars or more on Amazon, &amp; checking out the reviews on a couple of other sites as well, I decided on the Wahl 9818 All-In-One Lithium Ion.  I confess that I usually buy cheaper models, but decided to go up-scale a little this time to see if the quality would justify the additional cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 9818 arrived a couple of days ago &amp; so far it has surpasses every model I&#x27;ve ever had before.  It is simply outstanding &amp; even has a professional feel to it. The solid metal body is comfortable &amp; all the various clipper heads seem well-designed &amp; work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like that it&#x27;s American made; the body is stainless steel; the T-blade, &amp; all the blades are stainless steel &amp; are easily removable; the other heads interchange easily; the rotary nose trimmer performs better than my Panasonic unit; the LED on the on/off button indicates when it&#x27;s charging &amp; starts blinking when the battery is low; the multiple trimmer guides provide a wide selection regarding closeness of trim; &amp; the motor is relatively quiet &amp; performs very well.  I&#x27;m able to get a neat, precise, &amp; accurate trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is that the shaver cannot be used while charging - not a big deal as the led light flashes when the battery is low, there is a &amp;#34;quick charge&amp;#34;, &amp; the battery, when fully charged - seems to lasts a relatively long time. The battery should be replaceable. The trimmer guides could have been made out of a little better grade of plastic.  Another annoyance is the little plastic plug that&#x27;s in the base when you receive it, don&#x27;t lose it - you&#x27;ll need that for traveling to prevent the trimmer from turning on &amp; draining your lithium ion battery - I had to retrieve it out of the recycling bin after reading the manual!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pluses more than outweigh the minuses and thanks to all the reviews I read I knew about them before the purchase, so still give it 5 stars.  The Wahl 9818 is well designed &amp; built.  I was looking for a better trimmer &amp; it seems I&#x27;ve found it.  I highly recommend it.when you receive it, don&#x27;t lose it - you&#x27;ll need that for traveling to prevent the trimmer from turning on &amp; draining your lithium ion battery - I had to retrieve it out of the recycling bin after reading the manual!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pluses more than outweigh the minuses and thanks to all the reviews I read I knew about them before the purchase, so still give it 5 stars.

    <li> Great little groomer, light, made of metal, lots of accessories like nose and precision trimmers. Cuts easily and cleanly.</li>
    <li> Battery life is excellent.  Does not give a close cut to areas like the neck, but it does well for hair maintenance and beard trimming. Finish is brushed high quality stainless or has that appearance. Nice look. Hair does not stick to it. Trimmer heads pop off easily after you learn how to line up the cutter head. No stand is supplied, I had to use my old one, which is why it gets 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and procission trimmer.  This was exactly what I have been looking for. I&#x27;ve looked and tried several other facial hair trimmers in the same price range. None have come anywhere close to the Wahl 9818 personal groomer. Lasting charge fron the Lithiam Ion battery and charging system. I would reccommenr this trimmer to anyone looking for a High Quality, Procission, personal grooming trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works great. No problems. First time using such a device. The battery holds up well also and its easy to keep clean.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend to use as a face and hair trimmer. He loves it as a facial hair trimmer because it has a small blade that gives great close and detailed shaves. It charges super quick and keeps the charge even if he hasn&#x27;t used it in a month. You can NOT have this plugged in to charge and use it at the same time. In order to use it you must place the red tab in the bottom of the shaver (see instructions) He will not use it to cut his hair for two main reasons.  1) the actual blade is not large enough to his liking to cut his hair (he continues to use his peanut) 2) this shaver does not do 1/2 steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit on the heavy side but the design makes it easy to handle. The kit it comes with is very nice, the cloth case/bag fits everything perfectly</li>
    <li> I really want to like this clipper.  And overall I do, but it has some quirks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the eight T-blade guides are useless on my clipper.  They appear to have been made for a wider clippers, and don&#x27;t lock on properly.  Some fall off while you are picking it up, and the others sorta stay on but any pressure could move them or knock them off.  I wouldn&#x27;t trust them to cut my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three standard trimmer guides all fit properly.  However, the longest one trims much to short to use on my goatee, it cuts to less than 1/4\\&quot; length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 6-position adjustable guide also fits properly, and the range of adjustment is from almost a shave to about 1/2\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s problem is that, unlike all the other guides which have flat tops, the top on this one has a curve in it.  What this means is that you have no way to easily keep the body at the right angle to the skin to keep the cutting length consistent.  The first time I used it I couldn&#x27;t figure out why I had areas cut super short and others were barely trimmed at all.  I think the fix is to sand the top of the guide flat; if I do that I&#x27;ll report on how it goes.  But I really shouldn&#x27;t have to for this pricey an item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other accessories are equally cheaply made, but work OK.  I went to lubricate the nose trimmer and realized it&#x27;s driven by plastic shaft loosely fitted through a plastic hole.  It does work quite well though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another gotcha is the power button.  It&#x27;s the flush membrane type, which will probably keep moisture out, but the actual area you have to push is relatively small and takes moderate force.  If you have any kind of arthritis you may find it difficult or painful to operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smooth stainless body requires a firm grip since it has no rubber or molded protrusions to make it easier to hold, but I expected that from the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One nice thing is that the accessories from other similar sized trimmers fit, so you can buy the rotary head, small bladed detail trimmer, etc and they will all fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course it&#x27;s 120/240v, so if you travel that&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I don&#x27;t hate it, but I really would like to have loved it more, especially at this price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband for Christmas. I received the package today and it&#x27;s being sent back today. You can tell this product has been used...there were little black hairs in the package! I am disgusted and will NEVER do business with Amazon again!</li>
    <li> Best Clipper Ever!  Does it all - and the FEEL. Finally Tamed my Beard.</li>
    <li> OMG!!! I love this product...after going through 6 different pairs of clippers/trimmers, I am in love w/this one... 1 hour of charging once I got it out of the box and the rest is history.  This unit is very solidly built and have a very nice weight to it... I was able to finish my shaving chores in about 3 - 4 min vs the 10 min it took me w/the other trimmers... Great Job Wahl....Finally a trimmer that I will actually have more than 6 months.</li>
    <li> Its nice nowdays to buy something that is good quality.  Works well in everything I&#x27;ve done with it, good buy.</li>
    <li> Pretty good and easy to use. Wish it was a little faster so it wouldn&#x27;t pull my beard hair.</li>
    <li> When traveling on HAL I got a haircut--the salon used the Wahl  it did a remarkable job on trim-ears and nose---so I bought one and I&#x27;m pleased as punch.  Bob</li>
    <li> they could have done a better job building this $50 trimmer. the combs that come with the trimmer are very cheaply built.</li>
    <li> Look and work great. Best pair of clippers I&#x27;ve ever had. Stays charged for a long time. And it&#x27;s USA made!</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!!!! POWER BUTTON DOES NOT WORK. It turned on by itself on my counter and ran for hours. I couldn&#x27;t shut it off. Total waste of money!!!!</li>
    <li> Best razor to date. Great for beards and overall grooming. Slick design and very efficient. Beats all previously purchased Wahl brand.</li>
    <li> These trimmers are very well built and cut cleanly and easily.  It would easily be 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t so hard to clean the blades.  Let me explain that by saying it&#x27;s all the hair that get&#x27;s BEHIND the blade and between the plastic part that actually connects the blade to the motor.  Of course, the grease from the factory that&#x27;s globbed on these areas doesn&#x27;t help this situation whatsoever.  It&#x27;s not a deal breaker as these are still AWESOME trimmers, just something I&#x27;ve noted during use!</li>
    <li> the closest this tool cuts is not close enough for those who want a short beard.</li>
    <li> Was a Christmas gift and the person was very happy to receive it.He allways bought a cheap one this is a very good one.</li>
    <li> Based on manufacturer reputation, I bought it as a Christmas present for my son. He was quite pleased with it. Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I have bought Wahl products before and was not disappointed with this item. It is very solid and holds a charge forever. The attachments could use a better storage system, the Wahl hair clippers I own came with a sturdy box and this should have something similar.</li>
    <li> I like it, it&#x27;s very easy to use and the ability to remove the shaver head is very simple. It feel like a premium product; it build well, and not too heavy, its just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaining I have with it, its that it only come with one type of shaver which is the detail shaver which require a lot of time to shave with. I would really like the manufacture to provide a rotary shaver or dual shaver to save me some time, which i could I have use the detail shaver for more smaller area around my face.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T SHAVE REGULAR ..... SO SOMETIMES BEARD GETS ABOUT 1/2 INCH CLOGGING SAFETY RAZOR... NO PROBLEM FOR THIS QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY REMOVES BEARD AND OF COURSE TRIMS.&lt;br /&gt;CLEAN SMOOTH CUT.... IF PARTICULAR ONE DAY THEN USE SAFETY RAZOR AFTER GROOMER.&lt;br /&gt;OVER THE YEARS THE BEST ONE I HAVE OWNED.&lt;br /&gt;HEAVY AND APPEARS WILL MADE.</li>
    <li> Excellent material, feels solid! Motor is quiet and powerful. Battery is of unseen quality. I have had it now for approx. 4 Months and have charged it only twice . Nothing but positive feedback except for one thing: If you loose an attachment (the one you use most for instance), you&#x27;re screwed as I believe you cannot order them separately. The system of having 20 separate attachments is really not the best, but ok.... this shaver is high quality, high performance, can&#x27;t go wrong !!!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my son-in-law. My daughter said this is the one he likes and his other one is very old so that&#x27;s why I got it. Based on what she said it works great.</li>
    <li> These cost a little more than the cheaper plastic groomers available in stores, but they are WELL worth the money. The fact that they are metal makes them feel much sturdier, and the battery seems to last 5 to 6 times longer than other, cheaper clippers that I have purchased in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I bought this in May 2014 and used it about once a week on average.  A few months ago the power button started giving me problems.  And last week it just stopped working.  To add insult to injury I just called Wahl&#x27;s customer service and they expect me to pay for shipping to get it fixed.  No thanks.  I already spent $60 on this garbage.  It&#x27;s going in the trash where it belongs and I&#x27;ll go back to buying Phillips clippers.  UPDATE (2/16/15):  Colleen from Wahl contacted me directly and offered to replace the defective unit with a new one, which I received in the mail this weekend.  I changed my initial 1-star rating to 3 stars because of Wahl&#x27;s excellent customer service.  It&#x27;s rare these days for corporations to treat their customers with courtesy and respect.  Thank you, Colleen and Wahl, for standing behind your products and doing the right thing.  UPDATE (4/6/15):  It&#x27;s been 6 weeks since I received the replacement unit and it has stopped working.  Clearly, there is a defect in the design of the shaver.  Spend your money elsewhere.</li>
    <li> WIth the price and look, I thought that this would be one of their upper end product but compared to the other Wahls Trimmer that I&#x27;ve purchased over the year, this really is not their best.  I could not get as close as I wanted and the angle of the blade was very awkward  as well... In any case, I&#x27;m still a heavy user of Wahl&#x27;s product so I&#x27;ll still be purchasing another of their product after returning this one... This product was just a bit disappointing considering my other experience with their other trimmers... So please don&#x27;t get me wrong here... this trimmer does work well, it just was not as I had expected.  I really wanted a wireless trimmer for my beard (raizers tends to make my face bumpy)... this trimmer just did not get close enough for me and it was not one that I could adjust.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this little shaver.  Total quality, heavy, and holds a charge forever. I bought about 6 shavers before this one, and this one will be my last.</li>
    <li> Very good battery life and durability.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product just a few times and it works very well. For cutting my hair, it is the perfect machine however, since my primary reason for buying the product was to shaved I find that it doesn&#x27;t cut close enough, but overall a good product.</li>
    <li> Complete junk. I charged it for the recommended one hour upon first time charging, but it would not remain powered on for long. During the brief but pathetic time it did stay on, it was very loud. I could have lived with the noise, except it also would not cut a single hair on my forearm. I bought this at Target and will take it back post haste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/7/2014: I did not take the item back, although that was my intention at first. I discovered that the blade was not assembled correctly; the spring arms were not resting properly on the plastic portion of the clip. It was a simple fix, and now it is much quieter. Also, the charging issue seems to have worked itself out, so I&#x27;m not as upset as I was initially. However, the unit still has a serious shortcoming: the blade is not really very sharp. I have to make slow, multiple passes to effectively trim my hair so that the blade does not pull instead of cut. Very annoying, especially for a new unit. I want to like this product. It feels good in my hand, the weight is just right, and it&#x27;s built solidly. Oh, and it looks fantastic. I&#x27;m increasing the rating somewhat, but the dull blade is a major issue. Wahl, can you send me a replacement blade?</li>
    <li> It did not preform as I expected</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before buying this. I didn&#x27;t want to spent this much but all the reviews said not to go cheap. In the end, I figured I would have it for year so I opted to go for it. It&#x27;s a great decision! It works great, I love all the different options and the groomer works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Good trimmer, does not live up to the hype.</li>
    <li> So far it has lasted longer than any other cordless trimmer I&#x27;ve owned. Even if it dies tomorrow it&#x27;ll have been well worth it.</li>
    <li> Inexplicably will no longer turn on after charging and switching to multiple outlets to make sure the problem isnt on my end.  I have no ther choice but to throw away, as I cannot think of anything that could make it work. Used only once a month, a total of 4 times</li>
    <li> After two uses, the unit WILL NOT TURN OFF.  had to leave it on till the battery died.  will call wahl tomorrow.  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS ONE.  seems to be a common issue.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase of this trimmer. The one thing I wish Wahl would have done done is make an Organizer for this trimmer available for purchase. The travel bag doesn&#x27;t do it for me...</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase. Wasn&#x27;t certain I needed the SS version, but I&#x27;m glad I spent the few extra dollars.&lt;br /&gt;Good assortment of attachments. Product seems to be high quality at the 6 months in use stage...</li>
    <li> Heavy in your hand which feels nice after years of cheap trimmers. Powered through my long beard like a boss.</li>
    <li> Had an old Wahl, battery was not the Lithium Ion thus became weak and would not hold charge. Have used this one for some time and very pleased....new battery type and unit great.</li>
    <li> This is great! My only wish is that it had a stand to keep everything organized</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift just over a year ago. I&#x27;m giving it two stars because it stopped taking a charge after 6 months. The port for the cord seemed loose. Wall repaired it and all was well until two weeks ago when the same problem occurred. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item twice.  Both times it would not shut off, then would turn on when no one was near it.  I gave it the benefit of the doubt the first time, but it happened the same with the second one.</li>
    <li> this unit stopperd working after 5 weeks could not return it had to contact Wahl they want me to send it to them for repair  .&lt;br /&gt;not very happy</li>
    <li> Works well and comes with multiple to heads to meet all your needs.  I like the Wahl Company because they replaced the lithiuim battery on my three year old groomer for free even though I did not have a receipt.&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to their customer service department</li>
    <li> I had this for about a week. The 2nd time I used it when I was finished it would not turn off.  Then it decided it would just do what ever it wanted.  Not sure why. Wahl has a better reputation then this. Sent it back and now back in the hunt for another Wahl</li>
    <li> Like it alot. Wish it had a battery life guage, and wish the interchangeable heads used a stronger material than plastic to clip in and hold it in place.  It was a broken plastic arm that caused me to order this as a replacement to a less expense model from Wahl.</li>
    <li> Love the portability but it is loud and takes a few passes to get things right. Also, the accessory guides are very cheap and take many passes to get things clipped just right.</li>
    <li> Update Jan 2014 - Wahl repaired the unit and sent it back. It is working fine since then. I have been more careful with it now and haven&#x27;t allowed any water to get in to the head. I am upgrading the review from 2 stars to 3. Still not worth the hassle of returning, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t turn off even if a little water gets into the head. It completely stopped working after 3 or 4 uses. I had to sent it back to Wahl for repair and pay for shipping. Not very happy with the product so far.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had a Norelco trimmer for years. It just recenly broke and I wen&#x27;t looking for another. After reading a number of reviews I decided to give this trimmer chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like is the size. This helps to move the unit in positions that were a little difficult with my old unit. Basically I couldn&#x27;t see everything that I was doing in the past and now I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit comes with a 3 heads (Clipper, Detail Shaver, and the T-trimmer) and I used them all. Changing the heads is eay and the nice part about doing that it allows you to graduate your cuts and while also allowing for clean sharp edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One persons review that i read had complained about not having combs for the T-Trimmer head. It&#x27;s looks like Wahl heard you and has included enough heads to make anyone happy for both trimmer heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside that I can absolutely get use to is that I never had an elecric shaver and I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing, it&#x27;s great. Whahl offers an nuber of accsserioers and it looks like you can even pick up a foil 3 head shaver. I tried the detail shaver and I realized that I just need to make sure to get some king of after shave conditioner for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great little trimmer and I hope to have it a long time.</li>
    <li> Great Battery life, excellent selection of guards and switching heads.</li>
    <li> I bought this specifically because the power would work in the US AND abroad.&lt;br /&gt;The good news is it DOES work abroad. The bad news is it doesn&#x27;t work that well. It simply doesn&#x27;t cut hair (on top of your head) that well. Beard and body hair are all right but nothing to write home about.</li>
    <li> works well, and seems solid.  Wahl just makes good stuff. sounds silly, but its a big step down in power from the stable pro</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy from Amazon I bought it from target and it was garbage from day 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately noticed the power button was finicky but that wasn&#x27;t my problem. After fully charging the damn thing it just didn&#x27;t run fast enough. It runs so slowly that it probably pulled out 10 hairs moving incredibly slowly on one swipe of my beard with the number 3 attachment. My old Wahl trimmer probably pulled 10 hairs in the 5 years I&#x27;d been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably did get a particularly bad unit because this problem doesn&#x27;t seem typical but the one I got is useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also side note the thing weighed three times as much as my old Wahl.</li>
    <li> It claims it&#x27;s good for cutting hair (on your head) but haven&#x27;t tried that yet however it does work great on my face and mustache. Used it for a while and still doesn&#x27;t have that dieing battery sound yet, still strong!</li>
    <li> After two years but only twenty uses (less than a month&#x27;s shaves for a daily user), the power button stopped working and the unit tries to stay on all the time. Apparently this is a common issue as shown in the Q&amp;A. There&#x27;s a 5-year limited warranty but shipping it back from overseas will cost me fifteen bucks.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is fantastic. Strong, slim, and just a work of art. PLUS the fact that it is made in America assists my reasoning for purchasing</li>
    <li> Should have trusted what others said here.  Very hard to shut off.  Now the trimmer will not charge at only 6 months old.  I did email the satisfaction address on the 20th without an answer or &amp;#34;hey we got it thanks we will be in touch.&amp;#34; reply.   After the initial service failed to even send me my product back fixed, I have received the replacement and it has worked flawlessly as I would expect from Wahl. Thanks for the help getting this replaced.</li>
    <li> Great clipper..attachments are good..but needs an adjustable one for more settings..over all good clipper fast charge and holds charge for loong time.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! This item comes with multiple attachments and a bag to carry it all in. The whole unit has an ergonomic feel to it. No issues so far.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t get it wet. It messes with the on button.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer from Bed Bath and Beyond for 60$. You may be basing your decisions off the countless good reviews but let me tell you, this trimmer is very very cheaply made. I took the thing apart because the power button had a mind of its own. Finally it just quit charging all together. While taking it apart I realized how cheap the thing was with all the plastic and horrible design.I had the trimmer for about 6 months and it only worked correctly for the first 5 days haha. Most people on amazon post reviews after trying their products out only a handful of times. Do not buy this shaver, it is a piece of shit.</li>
    <li> Great slick design. Sharp clipper with all the attachments I would ever use and more.  It works great for nose hairs or to clean up around the ears...I would highly recommend this product.  I wish I would have bought it a long time ago.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this. He never would use one because he was given a very cheap one a long time ago and he said it pulled hairs out and was painful. He really likes this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many beard trimmers over the years and this is far and away the best. It is made of metal and has a solid feel.  Tons of attachments which all work surprisingly well.</li>
    <li> The shaver its self is great. Battery lasts hours without needing to be recharged. Good clean cut. Only complaint is that the accessories that come with it are a bit cheap. My No. 8 attachment was bent. The nose hair trimmer attachment hurts. Other than that its great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had other similar trimmers before and this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> This rascal is high quality. It has the feel of a professional tool. Lots of attachments, many I have not had a use for at this time but are nice to have if the need arises. Everything (including charger) fits in the included two-compartment zippered bag. This ain&#x27;t no rinky-dink trimmer. I&#x27;m very happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been eyeing this model for a few months at a local store. Usually I only spend $20 or so on beard trimmers as they&#x27;re practically disposable; Use it for 6 months - a year and buy a new one. I bought this model because it has good reviews and I wanted one that was rechargeable and hopefully will last longer than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is used to trim my goatee, eyebrows, nose, and ears. If I let my beard grow a week or so I&#x27;ll take it down to stubble with this before shaving.  It&#x27;s pretty good for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try cutting my hair with it. I keep a crew cut and it was 3 weeks or so of growth. This trimmer did cut the hair but it took several passes and still didn&#x27;t get all the hair. I wound up going over it with my full size clippers. No stars deducted because I knew it wasn&#x27;t made for your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of attachments and guards.&lt;br /&gt;Feels solid in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;Runs quite a while on one charge.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to detail facial hair with using the different heads.&lt;br /&gt;Love the nose hair trimmer -- I&#x27;d look like a mountain man without that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor isn&#x27;t very powerful; It&#x27;s just adequate. I&#x27;d hoped it would have a little more oomph!&lt;br /&gt;The case is only a bag. At ~$50 it should come with a nicely laid out solid case or stand, IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said I&#x27;d probably buy this model or the next model up again if this dies after a couple years. If it does&#x27;t last me more than a couple years then the increased price wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> Real junk. Power button stopped working after a few months. To late to retunn  to Amazon.  Guess I will try Wahl. Other reviews indicate problems with the power button. You can&#x27;t shut the unit off with the power button. You must plug in the charging adapter to turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from Wahl.  Years ago they made great products. Looks like they are putting out real cheap crap these days.</li>
    <li> This was a complete waste of money. I ended up buying the cheaper version Wahl 9854 and that machine works better than this. I thought that by buying the most expensive I would receive the highest quality but I was wrong. It did not do the simple job of trimming my beard, it just didn&#x27;t cut nearly enough and it did not come with a foil shaver either. Very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> This will be the Tesla S P85D of trimmers if Wahl just put a little more effort on making it reliable, maybe a few more quality internal longer lasting parts even if it costs more. You wont have to spend on returns and fixing it. And in 80 years down the line, old men around the world will be saying.. that Wahl 9818 ... they don&#x27;t make em like that anymore.. those crazy Americans boy do they know how to make a good trimmer..  This is my second 9818. The trimmer feels luxurious weighty, although smooth it is not slippery, you can feel the power. I read quite a bit about the power button not working but dismissed it after almost a year owning it. I&#x27;ve been using it gently maybe charged and discharge not more than 3 times. After all the cheap single AA battery trimmers out there this felt like something precious with its perfect carrying case, perfect trimmer.  Thought mine was ok until a month back, in the middle of a trim the trimmer would not switch off and I had a full charge. Worried the lithium ion battery might explode; I sadly had to deflower the trimmer to its bare bones which was another disappointment seeing its insides and cut the battery wire. I don&#x27;t think it will explode, inside it is just the same plastic $10 (retail) trimmer with a lithium ion battery.  Called customer support. Without the power button issue I would have still had that precious trimmer feeling. Kept positive smiled because things happen, sent it back. Thinking this was an issue a year ago, should be fixed by now. Went and bought another new 9818 while waiting for my old 9818 to come back.  Got my old one back with a new power switch it seemed. Pressed it a few times to feel it, was pretty hard to press and it felt like it will go too soon. Charged it fully and went for a trim, on first use in a middle of a trim again the thing wouldn&#x27;t shut off. Left it for an hour and then it offed when I pressed it. I think if it gets wet the on/off button wont work until it dries, maybe.  Anyways I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t go ahead with my plan of gifting this &amp;#34;perfect trimmer&amp;#34; to my dad, uncles, grandad, father-in-laws and brother-in-laws. Some residing overseas, imagine the switch giving way there.</li>
    <li> I know its cordless but I would like to at least use it while plugged in sometimes.  I know that nit-picking but you cant even turn it on while its plugged in.  Other than that its okay</li>
    <li> hard, solid and the battery performance is so far so good !</li>
    <li> Works for  me. Nice close  trims and mostly  quit.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a permanent (or near permanent) trimmer since starting my beard about 18 months ago i had probably gone through 3-4 of the $20-$30 range ones and was never happy enough to get the same one again.  Happy to say that this one is just what I was looking for, really heavy feel, like something a barber might actually have.  The charge lasts a long time and the cuts are supper clean and accurate.  Lots of attachments are easy to switch and keep clean, wish I had found this one sooner!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a cheaper Wahl trimmer.  I thought the first would be fine b/c of the brand name.  It was weak and the blades dulled quickly.  Not this one.  It&#x27;s powerful and the blades were much sharper from the start.  Easy to use and great features.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I&#x27;ve done extensive research for wireless clippers and finally found a great one. So far the only flaw I could find is the power button - pretty hard to turn on and off. Besides that, it&#x27;s pretty good. That&#x27;s considering I&#x27;ve only used it once but looking forward to use it again for my monthly hair cut.</li>
    <li> The groomer and all the attachments work as good or better than I expected. Great having the long charge with the lithium ion set up. The stainless steel body is very nice and feels secure in your grip.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great item well made w/sleek design and nice weight...it comes w/a nice selection of cutter/trimmer attachments a small carry bag and charger. If your looking for a high quality groomer at a very good price this is it.</li>
    <li> The lithium ion battery still looses power when confronted with thick hair, like other inexpensive battery charged trimmers. It is ver frustrating. The only benefit is the amount of time it holds the charge.</li>
    <li> I returned the first one of these I ordered for a few reasons, but one of them was that the normal trimmer head seemed dull as compared to the Wahl trimmer I was replacing.  I reordered this trimmer and it cuts exactly the same.  I don&#x27;t know why, it just does not seem to cut all that well.  I&#x27;ll live with it because I like the look and overall design and don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of sending it back, but I would NOT purchase this again.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an awesome trimmer at a great price - this is it. Beautiful fit &amp; finish, very portable, and amazing battery life.... You really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> very well made. the steel cleans easily</li>
    <li> Everything works as described, my boyfriend is very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I had it for less than 6 months and it stopped working.</li>
    <li> Absolute junk. It wouldn&#x27;t charge. The LED was flickering and you could see it couldn&#x27;t get a constant charging connection.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it- it has the power he needs. The charge lasts a long time.  All the attachments are handy to have.</li>
    <li> It is a very nice shaver and performs almost as well as my previous Wahl.  Unfortunetly I dropped it once and distroyed the smaller detail shave head with justa short fall.  The larger shave head is much more painful to shave with, bites me everywhere I use it, doesnt&#x27; shave as close! Nor can I find a suitable replacement head on Amazon or any other sight!! Very frustrating!  Good luck and keep it somewhere safe!&lt;br /&gt;The battery really does last a long time!</li>
    <li> I ultimately returned this product because clips that it came with were plastic.  They were bent and basically unusable.  Not worth the it.</li>
    <li> If you tired of getting frustrated with trimmers....spend the money and get this quality product! The battery life is great and it works every time and does exactly what you expect! I wish I would&#x27;ve purchased this product earlier.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I have had, The battery lasts for weeks with out charging and metal attachment is strong. Professional quality. Stop buying the cheap ones and spend the little extra for this trimmer</li>
    <li> Ordered this product for everyday grooming. The attachments are perfect -- great quality and easy to remove and clean. Makes crisp outlines at the neckline, sideburns and around the ears. Nose and ear trimmer was an added bonus for me. Haven&#x27;t had it catch on my skin at all. Five star recommendation. Just remember not to clean the blades with water.</li>
    <li> Good product. It&#x27;s my second set. Gave the first set away as a gift and they loved it so I bought me one. Just be careful taking the blade off.</li>
    <li> The bald guy&#x27;s dream...what a fantastic trimmer - much closer head shave than clippers...love the wireless...and with multiple attachments i don&#x27;t have to use those cheap ear/nose trimmers either!</li>
    <li> This is the second Wahl trimmer I&#x27;ve owned - and it is an upgrade from my first one.  I like the heft and ease of use (a push on/off button) and it has an indicator light that shows when it is charging - and when charging is complete.  The plug-in charger works with both 120 and 240 volt power supplies, making this ideal for international travel.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these for me. The first one was damaged and I liked the first one so much that it was an easy choice when it came time to replace it. These units come with tons of accessories to be able to get the length just right. The battery lasts for a couple of weeks between charges. I use it to keep my beard neatly trimmed an mom uses it to do some light trimming of the son&#x27;s hair. These units are very well built and are easy to hold. The head has a good angle on it that makes it easy to get around all the curves in the face. I highly recommend these units over the lesser priced units.</li>
    <li> Legit product. Thankyou for your prompt delivery! A+++</li>
    <li> At first I thought it had a charger issue, but it turned out it was just the outlet I was putting it into. Got here super quick and in good order, product works excellently.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite happy with this razor. As advertised it is lightweight and includes several useful attachments. I use for trimming multiple beard lengths. My wife appreciates my use of the nose hair trimmer...it is painless.</li>
    <li> Clippers does not a have any power to them, they struggled to cut my facial hair</li>
    <li> awesome, better than expected very solid heavy feel with great accesories thing seems bulletproof!</li>
    <li> Works great. Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> well made and handles well</li>
    <li> Cuts great but so badly designed one beard comb broke in the first few days. I&#x27;ve tried a handful of wahl cutters and sent them all back. I don&#x27;t want to buy something that feels like it will break to soon. Ended up with a panasonic - It was just better built and felt it would last longer.</li>
    <li> Too early to comment on reliability/durability but its in a different league to previous clippers.  Great design, easy to use.  Happy man.</li>
    <li> I have had this trimmer for months now. I have only had to charge it twice. The best trimmer I have ever had. All the attachments work great to.</li>
    <li> Very well made product, solid feel, and very sharp too.  Good balance and heft in the handling.  Impressive motor, and I got it with the top battery, and also ordered the Wahl Blade Oil as well.  I use this to trim my 74 year old moustache, and it does a superb job.  I highly recommend this quality shaver.</li>
    <li> from the time you open the box till your first use, you realize the quality of this trimmer--solid feeling trimmer with some heft-super sharp ground blades (not stamped like some inferior trimmers) and the high powered motor guarantees these blades will cut without pulling out hairs.  I tried installing the blade guides and once you realize how to install them, it&#x27;s an easy process.  I have only used the trimmer blade and the nose hair trimmer without using the guides  and it cuts great---just be careful not to cut deeper than you want as this cutter works quickly and you could gouge your beard</li>
    <li> It got wet the very first day I got it and completely stopped working, I couldn&#x27;t return it because I was in Afghanistan at the time</li>
    <li> I love this product, and when I dropped it they sent me a replacement blade for free, though I offered to purchase one. Wahl is a class act.</li>
    <li> The product works OK when it worked properly, looks and feels great. But on the second use it just wont turn off - luckily I kept the plastic tab used to kill off the power. In reading the reviews, this seems to be a common problem rather than a one off. I would not recommend this product until this major problem is resolved. Amazon did great in resolving the problem on the other hand - thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I received a defective unit, but this groomer was incredibly underpowered. I had to make almost 15 passes in the same area to get an even shave. Granted I do have thick hair, so if you&#x27;re in the same position then this shaver might not be for you.  At first glance it seemed very high quality, but all in all it was just okay. It took a lot longer than usual to trim my beard, and even without any guides it was having trouble removing hair.  It does look sleek though, I&#x27;ll give them that.  I ended up getting the Panasonic ER1511, which is way more powerful, although not as versatile. It&#x27;s also more expensive, but you get what you pay for. The construction is way better and it functions at around 7,000 RPM. I couldn&#x27;t figure out how many RPM this groomer was, but I would be surprised if it was more than half of that.  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KK769A/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> This item worked well for the short time that it worked</li>
    <li> Awesome. I have had a gazillion trimmers over the years. This is the best build quality feel battery life and attachments.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27; go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> Solid, well built.  Looks great.  Wish it would have a sleek stand to match.</li>
    <li> I would love to give this product 5 stars, but since I&#x27;ve only used it about 5 times, and now the charger does not work anymore I&#x27;m giving it 1 star. It has become a paper weight.</li>
    <li> On time and works as expected. Worth the dough.</li>
    <li> This was an enormous improvement over the Babyliss pivot-motor trimmer that preceded it.  I was skeptical but decided to heed the advice of some other reviewers.  If you are on the fence, I suggest you plunk down the extra $10-20 over a cheapo trimmer and get one of these.  It is small, portable, works well, comes with a full complement of combs and adapters, and holds a charge forever.</li>
    <li> Good Stainless Trimmer. Detail Trimmer attachment is really good. Almost pro level. Good charge, no problem with on-off switch. Lots of needless attachments. Oil for sharpening. Case is a joke. China made plastic attachments. Heavier than it looks. Shaver attachment is really bad! I will order double edge shaver attachment later. Nose clipper is good. Easy to switch attachments. No holder for Unit, I just put back in cheap case. So far, it works nicely for me.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Replaced a lower quality product from another manufacturer with this product that is made in the USA. This one works great. I am very pleased. Quiet operation, lots of attachments for different jobs. It simple works better than I had hoped. I will recommend this product to all who are looking for a personal groomer. It is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. By far better than trimmers I have spent more money on. Still haven&#x27;t had to recharge after the initial charge a few weeks ago</li>
    <li> I have a neatly trimmed goatee that I&#x27;ve kept for almost 10 years. I shaved it off once this summer and my kids and wife laughed at me... so back went the growth. I use a stubble trimmer to keep everything neat but always need something more refined around my lips, under my nose and around my ears. I&#x27;ve been through a ton of these things and never found a \\&quot;perfect \\&quot; model that didn&#x27;t shred my lips or always feel like it was dragging. This model has tons of power, charges great, feels incredibly sturdy and sharp and cuts really cleanly without feeling like it&#x27;s going to cut me. My face doesn&#x27;t feel beat up after I use this and doesn&#x27;t have all the cheap plastic combs that hurt when you use them. Love it... and very glad I finally found a solid trimmer!</li>
    <li> Second one just failed. I&#x27;ve already returned, and exchanged, one due to power issues. Now, the second one is shorting out where the power cord plugs in to the device. The blue charge light flickers and then goes out no matter what position I hold it in.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s right folks. It&#x27;s this consumers opinion that it&#x27;s an over priced bad design.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered the Panasonic beard trimmer ($20 less) as every Panasonic product I&#x27;ve ever known works flawlessly for years.&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s too late to get my money back, I&#x27;m going to try to get it replaced and keep the replacement as a backup until it too fails.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Wahl, but this is too frustrating.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit to use as a replacement for a 10 year old Norelco grooming razor. The Wahl 9818 is sleek looking, and the attachments seem well-made and useful. However, after one use, the power button does not function properly. On the rare occasion that I can get the razor to turn on, I cannot make it turn off. I have twice left it buzzing away to run the battery down to nothing in frustration. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK.</li>
    <li> My brother loves his shaver! Good quality at a great price.</li>
    <li> I typically use a Wahl peanut for trimming my beard, but I have been looking for something with a better variety of guide lengths. I cam across this trimmer and Wahl&#x27;s site stated it had more power than their standard trimmer. What I didn&#x27;t realize is they must&#x27;ve meant more power than their standard cordless trimmer.... this thing has zero power. It gets caught up very easily in my beard resulting in pulled hairs and an uneven cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on looking into returning it.</li>
    <li> I have finally found a well built trimmer with a good battery.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like a classic groomer from 40 yrs ago -- only without the cord. It&#x27;s a little clumsy to get the right angle for mustache trimming because of the nose getting in the way but that&#x27;s not a product fault. Just the nature of a trimmer. The stainless case is solid &amp; the lithium battery lasts forever. The power button is flush mounted &amp; a little difficult to press.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware!  This doesn&#x27;t come with the adjustable comb for beards or the trimmer that would fit it.  I was amazed after I read the manual that these pieces weren&#x27;t included in the package.  I called the company, and they stated that the trimmer no longer comes with those accessories.  I was very surprised as a beard trimmer wouldn&#x27;t come with the beard trimming extras.  Didn&#x27;t make sense to me.  As far as the trimmer it seems ok.  Not sure it was worth the extra expense, but I will say it doesn&#x27;t seem to pull my hair out as much as my old one.  The old trimmer used to give me ingrown hairs every time I would trim.  So far so good with this, so I will probably keep it.  Also, I really like the fact it has a lithium battery which seems to last as long as advertised and it&#x27;s not dead everytime you go to use it like the other re-chargeables.</li>
    <li> All the complaints you see about the faulty power switch are just the beginning. In under 20 uses the item went from not being able to turn off to no longer being able to turn back on.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item at the beginning of January, 2013 and it stopped functioning as of the end of August, 2013. When plugged in, I see a flash of blue light coming from the on / off button and that is about all I can make it do at this point. Does not turn on, or make any indication of still functioning. When I researched various brands at the beginning of the year, I was under the assumption that Wahl brand products were well made. Perhaps I happened to get a bad item, perhaps not. What I can say is that it was only used twice a week for the last nine months or say, meaning that it was a fairly expensive per cost use at this point. Bottom line, beware that it may not be as good of a trimmer as expected.</li>
    <li> feel razors should face thee other way so when cutting around ears the angle of handle doesnt touch .</li>
    <li> Best clippers ever! Somebody on here described it best when they said, &amp;#34;the only one you will ever buy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> works really well. I like it.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer, does a great job, battery life is amazing, the stainless steel casing is much better than the \\&quot;soft\\&quot; handle offered on a simlilar model as hair doesn&#x27;t stick to this handle.</li>
