      <li>Twice per month with no issue of any kind, and end up with a neat haircut as in a barber shop.</li>
      <li>I sit nicely in my chair while the wife cuts my hair.</li>
      <li>Would recommend to anyone who cuts their own hair.</li>
      <li>It just kind of gnawed ineffectually at my sons hair.</li>
      <li>I bought this clipper so that I could cut my own hair at home.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;They are lightweight which is nice on the wrists.  </li>
      <li>so I have to rely on her perspective as opposed to my own</li>
      <li>The dial for adjusting length is nice.</li>
      <li>I also own one of those 20-piece sets but all the attachments turned me off and I never used it.     </li>
      <li>Works okay on the longer setting but not so good on shorter setting.</li>
      <li>, it fits nicely into my hand.  </li>
      <li>This is a Nice Product.</li>
      <li>Excellent product, highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I feel very confident that it will provide me with another 10 years of satisfied styles.  </li>

      <li>It also cleans very easily.</li>
      <li>This is my 1st Hair Clipper purchase and I have to say that it was very easy to use.</li>

      <li>If so, then this is by far the best clipper we&#x27;ve ever used and</li>
      <li>This is one of the best clippers I have used so far.</li>
      <li>so, then this is by far the best clipper we&#x27;ve ever used and</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t speak for durability or longevity, but these clippers were fast to charge and cut my hair incredibly well.  </li>
      <li>It charges well, cuts great, is comfortable when using (I like the pivoting head), and adjusts easily.</li>
      <li>Also, it cuts very close when comb attachment is removed so it is perfect for getting a nice clean neck line.</li>
      <li>The blade adjustment mechanism seems to be very good too, much better than my older Norelco unit, which could be pushed in very easily if you set it to say 6, and pushed it</li>
      <li>I would say its a good affordable choice for people who like to do it themselves, or armed service members who need to look clean for their duties.</li>
      <li>Very easy to get it nice and clean too; the blade mechanism comes apart very easily.</li>
      <li>I just cut my hair by yourself, very accurate.</li>
      <li>for #7 - #13 (1 11/16\\&quot;) (allows for 38 settings for very smooth tapering!!)&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning brush (not needed since unit is washable)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But regardless, the shaver itself feels very cheap.</li>
      <li>Very light and ergonomic feeling.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I cannot think of what more I can ask from this clipper as the performance</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome product. I basically shave my hair at home. Easy to use. Great power. and Fun to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper about 2 years ago. Works perfectly. The problem is that the bigger comb attachment broke a week ago and when I contacted Philips they said that they only had the part I need in Singapore. Someone from Philips in Singapore then contacted me and said it would cost me $80 for them to ship it to me. For $80 I can buy 2 new clippers. What a joke!</li>
    <li> i bought this product a year ago and it works great but I recently Broke a blade off of the guard and Phillips says that they do not sell replacements because they are too expensive. So now I have a perfectly good running unit that I can&#x27;t use. Talk about frustrating. They did say I could buy a new unit from then. My response was you screw me once it&#x27;s your fault, you screw me twice it&#x27;s mine.</li>
    <li> useful, useful, and useful. did i tell you this product is very useful?&lt;br /&gt;it is not water proofed, do not use in shower. not very convenient to clean, if you need for travel, battery will last long enough.</li>
    <li> wow  this clipper is much better  then i had hope for. hard to explain how good it works best clipper iv ever owned and iv had many over the years  you do have to clean the hair from the comb  often other then that  its sweet</li>
    <li> I just cut my hair by yourself, very accurate. I used it for 10 minutes, and it works great.  Just follow the instructions, make sure your hair is dry before cutting.</li>
    <li> Got this for my fiance for Christmas, he loved it so much he cut his hair with it that night!  He keeps his hair close cut and this shaver got the closest.  I bought it for the cordless feature and it works great!  It is light and easy to use.  I wish it came with a travel case, but we are just going to keep the old hard case from his corded clipper.  A great gift for a guy!</li>
    <li> Very sharp, pretty good for hair, easy use. I used many other one, they all like this one..first time I just spent five minute to take care my son&#x27;s hair. He like it, because not hurt, he said.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. My old connair died out of charge! This unit is neat and powerful, just dial your length and cut hair. Charges quickly too,</li>
    <li> It&#x60;s a good deal for that price simple,and with cord and cordless use :) i purpose that to all people</li>
    <li> Haircuts are expensive, especially when you are in the military. Instead of paying and tipping a pro, I just have my girlfriend give me a 3 star haircut for free. It holds plenty of charge and there is a wide selection of lengths. I think I&#x27;ve had like 7 haircuts already so it has paid for itself.</li>
    <li> PROS:      - lightweight     - cordless     - waterproof for easy cleanup     - adjustable trimmer eliminates the need for dozens of attachments    CONS:     - Does. Not. Cut. Hair.    Seriously. It just kind of gnawed ineffectually at my sons hair. After a few minutes he started to look like \\&quot;Doc\\&quot; from Back to the Future. Took out my old corded Wahl and it zipped right through his hair.     Rating: ONE STAR</li>
    <li> Just wanted to share that these clippers worked great for me.  They cut my hair on the first few passes and I was able to finish within 15-minutes.  No problem at all.  In fact, I would highly recommend these if you are considering cutting your own hair.  I also own one of those 20-piece sets but all the attachments turned me off and I never used it.     With these clippers, I used the highest setting, approximately 1.5-inches, after I washed/dried my hair.  I then recut the sides and back w/ a lower setting which I believe was 1-inch.  Everything worked fine, better than expected.</li>
    <li> This clipper is much better than any of the clippers I have purchased elsewhere for $30-40.  Well worth the money.  -There are many more adjustments at the turn of a dial than most other clippers have with changing attachments.  I was able to chose a length that was between the standard sized offered by my last clippers.    -It is quiet.    -It recharges in under an hour and works for multiple haircuts, even if you let it sit for weeks without charging it.  -It is easy to clean, with the blades attached to a hinge that flips them out for easy washing in the sink.  -The blades are sharp enough that they don&#x27;t leave lines in my hair.</li>
    <li> Looked long and hard for a budget hair trimmer. Most that were inexpensive got low reviews. This clipper seemed to have good reviews and my beard was getting out of control so I bought on a blow out sale. Got it quickly and charged it up. This unit has a great feel to it and makes it easy to cut with. I am a bit sensitive to vibrations and this unit gives me no problems. I was a bit hesitant to order as I would be using it to keep my beard trim but no need to worry as this give nice clean cuts and keeps a charge for a long time. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is my 1st Hair Clipper purchase and I have to say that it was very easy to use. The unit is sleek, light and most important - very low buzzing noise and very low vibration. You do not feel like you have been put thru a grinder after using it. Cutting was even, quick and no stress. The dial up or down settings is very, very convenient. The only negative I saw was that the combs felt flimsy. Will have to see how long this unit will last. I am happy with the purchase and highly recommend this clipper. A+.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1V3AU9SKBWT2O]]This is my first hybrid (cord and/or cordless) clippers. They are extremely comfortable to use. I usually cut my own hair and doing so with these was fun. They do a decent, but not perfect job. They cut dry hair very well and suffer on hair that is wet (most clippers I&#x27;ve tried have issues with wet hair). Using these clipper without the cable is a change and really makes it easier to get the job done.  Pros:  1. Lithium Ion battery with a fast charge time and decent usage time.  2. Corded and/or Cordless operation, using it without a cord was great for cutting my own hair.  3. Very easy to adjust length settings. This is one of my favorite parts. You only have two attachments, but 38 different lengths. It&#x27;s very easy to switch between lengths within 1-2 seconds. I used the shorter attachment for the sides of my head and the bigger for the top.  4. Charged from the Factory. It comes ready to use. I cut my hair off the factory charge, then toward the end I plugged in for the last 5-10 min.  5. Very light and ergonomic feeling. I like the design, it fits nicely into my hand.  Cons:  1. The attachments are the weakest part of the product, but I see them standing up to normal use just fine.  2. When the battery gets low the power output isn&#x27;t consistent. Toward the end of my haircut I plugged in and continued.  3. Doesn&#x27;t cut wet hair well. I started to sweat and it still cut my hair, but I had to dry my hair to get the results that I wanted.  4. No blade adjustment. The blade itself doesn&#x27;t adjust.  Conclusion:  Great value! There are other options that are strictly corded clippers at this same price point that will cut better than these, but for how convenient and easy it is to use just 2 attachments instead of 12 and have it be a cordless hybrid really sealed the deal for me. I&#x27;d recommend it to any that needs a haircut :)</li>
    <li> These hair clippers are just what I have been looking for. For years I&#x27;ve struggled with using a Wahl trimmer that came with numerous attachments. I only really used two or three and those eventually wore out and started falling off while cutting my hair. This Norelco clipper is much easier, with just two attachments and adjustable length settings on the clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Cordless operation makes this so much easier to handle than a corded trimmer, while still having the option to run with the cord attached if not charged.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to adjust length settings with a dial. Comb won&#x27;t slip and cut too short.&lt;br /&gt;-The contour-following comb makes trimming easier.&lt;br /&gt;-Very light makes it easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to clean, just rinse off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Fairly weak, it does take a few passes to get all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;-A bit too large, makes it somewhat awkward to maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;-Combs do seem a bit flimsy, so I&#x27;m not sure how long they will hold up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;A vast improvement over old fashioned corded clippers. A few minor flaws but these clippers are very convenient and easy to use. Would recommend to anyone who cuts their own hair.</li>
    <li> I have a Panasonic cordless clipper and got this Philips recently to replace my old Panasonic. I made a comparison here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic:&lt;br /&gt;1)very good quality Japanese product, nothing breaks during 4 years use,&lt;br /&gt;2)a set of 6 combs with 12 different lengths from 40mm to 3mm,&lt;br /&gt;3)cordless, waterproof, washable, but need to apply lubes to blades every time after use,&lt;br /&gt;4)NiMH battery, 8-hour charging time, now the battery is dying,&lt;br /&gt;5)more expensive when I bought it,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips:&lt;br /&gt;1)can&#x27;t tell the quality, but the two combs seem very flimsy,&lt;br /&gt;2)two adjustable combs, with 24 variable length settings from 40mm to 3mm,&lt;br /&gt;3)cordless, washable, claimed to be self-sharpening blades and no oil needed, but the blades are noisier than Panasonic when working&lt;br /&gt;4)Lithium battery, 1-hour charging time, also lightweight,&lt;br /&gt;5)much cheaper, got it on sale for $24&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing to Panasonic, the Philips is a simpler product with less combs and faster charging.&lt;br /&gt;However, Philips has a major defect -- the hinge of the comb yanks hair. It yanks a couple times per hair cut, not as bad as the other review, but my Panasonic never has this problem. For household electronics like this, I&#x27;ll stick with the Japanese next time.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I&#x27;ve needed for years. I&#x27;ve used Wahl clippers for as long as I can remember, usually buying a new one every couple of years. But what a pain having a box full of cluttered attachments when I only need one or two sizes, but I could never bring myself to throw out the ones I didn&#x27;t need, just in case. This Norelco has the ability to do even more different lengths with only two easily adjustable attachments. I cut the hair on my head, trimmed my beard, and shaved off all my neck hair in no time. Cut is sharp and even, cleans easily, relatively quiet and best of all it&#x27;s cordless! I did get this as a lightning deal, so I paid slightly less, but I would have paid double their asking price without a doubt. Only downside is it is slightly too big to trim down my mustache. I managed but it wasn&#x27;t easy.</li>
    <li> These clippers have one excellent feature which I&#x27;ve not found elsewhere, which is the ability to adjust the length of the guard in increments of 1 millimeter by rotating a dial. If that&#x27;s appealing to you then I absolutely recommend these clippers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have ever tried to fade hair you know that this requires you to remove and attach several guards multiple times over the course of the haircut. On top of that, cheaper clippers don&#x27;t always come with an assortment of guards in the lengths you hoped for. That&#x27;s not a problem with these Norelco clippers since you can adjust the guard in increments of one millimeter buy rotating a dial. That is amazing! I&#x27;ve never been able to consistently achieve a smooth fade on my own hair until I started using these clippers. Older models with the same feature used to let you adjust the length using a slide mechanism that was very easy to nudge accidentally, but that&#x27;s fixed in the design of this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers come to a full charge in one hour and run for about an hour. They are lighter and quieter than the cheapo clippers I had before (Wahl, Remington) and they vibrate less intensely so my hands don&#x27;t go numb from holding them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some users reported that the clippers pulled their hair, so I was worried about that, but happily did not experience any problems. Make sure the clippers are fully charged before you use them (more cutting power). I find clippers are generally are less happy cutting through longer hair, so you may want to do a first pass with scissors if your hair is long. It&#x27;s possible clippers will pull if you push them too quickly - start slow until you find a comfortable speed. The blades can also become jammed up with hair bits, so make sure you keep them clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been waiting for Norelco to make a pair of clippers like this for years ever since the early adjustable models were discontinued, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. These excellent clippers will pay for themselves over several haircuts, so I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve ordered this item I&#x27;ve needed two haircuts. Give yourself about a 3 month window if you decide to purchase from this seller. However, the product itself seems nice enough.</li>
    <li> very useful , very powerful,</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my husband&#x27;s hair for most of the past 14 years. I have used both corded and cordless clippers from many different manufactures.  I have used el cheapo clippers from box stores and more expensive name brand clippers from a salon supply.  All in all, the Philips Norelco Hair Clipper Pro with the Lithium Ion battery is the best I have ever used!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions indicate an hour of charge for 60 minutes of run time.  I charged the clippers for the prescribed hour then we went to work on his hair.  Yes, I said \\&quot;WE\\&quot;.  Despite some physical limitations on his part he was mostly able to cut his hair himself. With some practice he should be able to cut all of his hair himself with just quick assistance to clean up the neck line.  This is not possible with the other trimmers, especially with their myriad of attachments for different lengths and the interference of the cord.  This trimmer easily allowed for shorter lengths at the neckline and around the ears without looking choppy. The appearance using this cutter was BETTER than a typical professional haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included:&lt;br /&gt;Clippers&lt;br /&gt;Recharging cord&lt;br /&gt;Comb for #1 - #6&lt;br /&gt;Comb for #7 - #13 (1 11/16\\&quot;) (allows for 38 settings for very smooth tapering!!)&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning brush (not needed since unit is washable)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clipper never needs oiling, which is another plus!  The fact the clipper is washable and CORDLESS means he can stand in the shower to trim his hair. This translates to mean if the clippers are used periodically for routine hair maintenance (as opposed to using less frequently tackling a long mane) then cleaning up the cut hair afterwards is as simple as taking a shower and washing the hair fragments down the drain. The clipper is made with a cheap plastic housing however this helps to cut down on the overall weight of the clippers which is one of the reasons it is much easier for my husband to cut his own hair than the much heavier constructed units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet determined if the blade is replaceable.  If so, then this is by far the best clipper we&#x27;ve ever used and the price is all that much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Reportedly the blade is replaceable though we have not needed to tackle this aspect yet - though now I&#x27;m certain the blade is replaceable, I have not yet looked to where to buy the replacement blade. The clipper is DURABLE. We dropped the clipper, the cutting comb and blade each popped out upon impact. It was a breeze to reassemble and nothing broke, not even the plastic parts that hold everything together.  This is definitely a 5 star product!If so, then this is by far the best clipper we&#x27;ve ever used and the price is all that much better!

    <li> it&#x27;s very nice and useful, i like it very much, philips always give us a beauty little piece. I love it</li>
    <li> This is a low end clipper but I knew that going in.  It&#x27;s extremely light weight and feels cheap, but it actually does quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guide comb is a little strange.  The adjustment works great making it shorter or longer but the comb initially doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s actually cutting the hair.  Especially on shorter hair.  It takes a couple of passes before you feel like it&#x27;s working.  That mostly has to do with the rounded tips of the guide comb.  That&#x27;s to make it feel nicer on your head, which it feels fine, but it could be a little sharper so you know it&#x27;s passing through the hair.  One downside is that because the guide comb creates a gap between the guide and the cutting edge, hair gets trapped under the guide comb and periodically it works best to take the guide off and shake it out.  This really isn&#x27;t a big deal and is very easily done, but a redesign would probably alleviate this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batter holds a charge for a long time.  The clippers are reliable and not having to oil them is brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are lightweight which is nice on the wrists.  Reasonably powerful. They get the job done and cordless is awesome!</li>
    <li> Great for grooming, touch ups or shaving your head.  Doesn&#x27;t really have enough power for full hair cuts though.  Battery has enough juice to last all week on the road.</li>
    <li> Great clippers. I was looking for a pair of clippers that had the better lithium ion batteries in them and came across these. They are quiet and plenty powerful enough for my hair. They feel solid and have two fully adjustible comb atachments. During my first cut I never once had any pulling of hair or did the clippers seem to slow while cutting. Just great power all the way through. Also, it cuts very close when comb attachment is removed so it is perfect for getting a nice clean neck line. Wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable at all. Overall 5/5 for quality, price point and performance!</li>
    <li> Has hard time cutting even thin hair&lt;br /&gt;Make to whole process very painful and slow&lt;br /&gt;i would not buy it again</li>
    <li> Excellent hair clippers. Most to all the lengths are at your fingertips. Clippers itself feel good in the hand and they are plenty powerful enough to cut and style your hair. Highly recommend these clippers.</li>
    <li> I bought these for the higher cutting height and I have not been disappointed.  Using the highest cut setting, it cuts at inch and half to inch and three quarters, does a great job.  The Norelco clipper is very solid and sturdy, so far it cuts like a hot knife thru butter.  When I got around to cutting my hair, it was a little more challenging...  my hair is fine, thin hair so it took several passes to get it all thru the cutter.  We did follow the directions which state to cut against the way the hair lies.  I am still very pleased with the product so far.</li>
    <li> Bottom line, its not powerful enough, it will skip over airs, which means you have to keep going back over and over to get everything. Plus no easy way to angle the clipper for those hard to reach areas (behind the ears).</li>
    <li> I keep my hair cut very short. I run this trimmer over my head about every two weeks.  I have tried other trimmers that made various claims.  This Norelco clipper is perfect for the job.  The battery lasts over several weeks.  It is easy to clean. as width other Norelco products the quality is the selling point.</li>
    <li> Sorry amazon for the late review. I&#x27;ve been using this clipper for over a years already without any headache, easy to carry where ever you go. For all the buyers and planning to have some clipper, i would recommend this machine.</li>
    <li> its very easy to use and very strong very fast but big and lond to hold i like it itse beteer than my old one and made in poland not china</li>
    <li> This thing is wonderful because of the extended guard length.  I have found no other clipper that lets me leave the hair 1.5 inches long like this one does.  I haven&#x27;t paid for a haircut since I bought it, which has now been a couple years I think.  I hope this thing never breaks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this clipper for about 10 months now and it&#x27;s worked very well. The battery life is more than sufficient and the charge time is very fast. The array of options for hair length is also very impressive.</li>
    <li> great buy, low noise, light weight, I give 5 stars now, but I know, clipper normally become less satisfaction over time, I want to wait and see.</li>
    <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Yanks hair so mercilessly that getting through a normal haircut might not be prudent.&lt;br /&gt;No instructions regarding whether and how to apply clipper oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cordless so you can more easily use it and thus determine more promptly to pack it up and return it.&lt;br /&gt;Easy return currently available on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping for a nice change from my old clipper that I felt was cutting a little worse than in its younger days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the Reviews for this one, and was optimistic that it would be a nice replacement.  There was a one-star review, but it had lots of thumbs down and it looked like there was a response about how to remedy the situation, and the response had lots of thumbs up.  So not to worry, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used it, it yanked my hair mercilessly.  I had dry hair like it said to have.  I looked over the instructions and couldn&#x27;t find anything about correcting the blade or otherwise dealing with this issue.  I couldn&#x27;t find an obvious way to adjust the blade and looking over the unit, it didn&#x27;t seem to be a blade adjustment issue anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried really hard at least to complete the haircut but it was way too painful.  So I got out the old clipper and with much less yanking, it got the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final note:&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t find anything about clipper oil application.  The instructions should say whether clipper oil should be applied to the clipper and if so, how to apply it to this clipper in particular. But nothing!</li>
    <li> I really hope this is a good item if I have to wait over a month to get it because it was at a special price. If you have bought it at around $20.00 I guess you will not get it until everyone else paid $40 for it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this clipper and was using it for about 2 weeks now. I have to give it an excellent rating. It does exactly what I wanted it to do. I love the ability it gives you to leave the amount of hair you want on your head without having to uses that many attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two attachments only and you can cut your hair the length you want it. All off or a good 2 inch on. -That being done with just the turning of a wheel that pushes up or down the attachments to create the cut length you desire.  That&#x27;s what I wanted. The attachments are not that sturdy but they work well. I will have to see how durable the machine is over time but the stars are for functionality taking into consideration the price paid.</li>
    <li> I have bought it since 1 month. I have deliver it soon and it meets my expectations; easy to use, fast, and make you cut your hair alone without any help.</li>
    <li> About 1/3 as powerful as my previous battery powered hair clipper! the Remington HC600 (also bought here on Amazon). While the 5 year old nicd powered clipper will always cut that patch of hair in ONE pass (and very evenly), it seems I have to go over it many times with the new Qc5340 and not even achieving the same even result. The only thing better with the Qc5340 are:&lt;br /&gt;1) Adjustable built-in guide&lt;br /&gt;2) Makes less noise (cause it&#x27;s less powerful and effective)&lt;br /&gt;3) I guess the li-ion will last longer&lt;br /&gt;But to #3 above, I never use the Qc5340 enough to know how long the battery lasts since I have to keep going back to my 5 year old Remington to get the job done. While it&#x27;s on its last legs with peeling paint and weak battery, it still OUT PERFORMS the Qc5340. I think that is a sad realization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And about the adjustable comb guide system. While it sounds good on paper, I realized 2 major drawbacks after real world use:&lt;br /&gt;1) If you&#x27;re accustomed to using the very short comb guide at the end to clean up on some detailed areas, this adjustable system makes this process very difficult as you can&#x27;t really see the blade and thus exact contact point.&lt;br /&gt;2) I wish the guide adjustment knob was in &#x27;mm&#x27; or &#x27;inches&#x27; and not the guide number. But this is my personal taste I guess.</li>
    <li> Got these for clipping my son&#x27;s hair .  Not bad but after a few uses have to unscrew the blades to clean hair stuck under it.  In general good purchase for the money  They are easily cleaned , you just pull the blade unit , its ona a hatch   Three years later : I bought these on  August 10, 2012.  Been using this on all of my family , my Dad , brother me and my son . Still razor sharp . Excellent product !!!</li>
    <li> No complains so far. Seems to work well, blades are sharp, it holds a good charge. Very easy to get it nice and clean too; the blade mechanism comes apart very easily. The blade adjustment mechanism seems to be very good too, much better than my older Norelco unit, which could be pushed in very easily if you set it to say 6, and pushed it you could end up with a 3 or 4. This one seems pretty nice, I hope it lasts a while.</li>
    <li> After over a year, and several hair cuts, I find no problem with this product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not overly fancy, but it does what it does well.</li>
    <li> This hair cutter is amazing. The battery life goes on and on. I eventually, after numerous haircuts, charge it even when charging is not needed. The hair clipper, without the height-clip, is good for cutting hairs on my neck. Excellent hair cutter. Quiet and easy to clean. Easy to hold and use. Other reviewers who had problems must have gotten a bad unit. I love this hair cutter, with its high quality, features, good hair cutting, and cordless operation.</li>
    <li> The resellers for this item are pretty pathetic. The box is old and dated, and has a price tag stuck to the box from another store. The price tag reads $39.99. I know this shaver was introduced in 2011. The box clearly looks that old. But regardless, the shaver itself feels very cheap. Big and bulky, but hollow plastic. The newer Norelco is cheaper and looks better quality. This thing just feels too cheap.</li>
    <li> this makes my whole DIY haircut experience so much better.  No annoying cable.  LITHIUM battery last forever and charge up really quickly.  It is super light, 3 times lighter than a wired WAHL&#x27;s clipper that I have.  Easy clean-up.  Sharp teeth that I rarely have any strand of hair left uneven.  The design is so clever you don&#x27;t really need any additional attachments.  Very easy to switch the #&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I shave my head with it every month (I have thick hair) and this phillips does the job&lt;br /&gt;I use it for a thick beard from time to time to trim it and it&#x27;s good too</li>
    <li> The one star is for Norelco&#x27;s website policy of coercing the purchaser to go through a survey to warranty the product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Gets the job done! I would say its a good affordable choice for people who like to do it themselves, or armed service members who need to look clean for their duties. GO ARMY!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for 2 years now and it saves me a lot of money.  I used to have to get my hair cut once a month, but now I only get it cut every 4 or 5 months.  When my sideburns start getting crazy or my hair start coming over the top of my ears is when I know I need a hair cut.  I use this in between  haircuts.  There comes a point where I need a professional to work on my hair, but this keeps me away for several months.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper because I wanted one that can be rinsed in the shower after use. I appreciate not worry about the unit getting wet and not have to take the time with using the cleaning brush after every use. I added waterproof bands around the body for better grip in the shower; the unit can be slippery if you are turning it in your hand. The quality ot the clip guard is is poor , thin plastic feels like it could snap any minute if I press too hard (so I won&#x27;t press too hard) as I use the lowest possible setting. The haitcuts have been smooth and even so far and it holds a charge as advertised, I&#x27;ve used it a dozen times so far on one charge.</li>
    <li> This is a Nice Product. This product is, as described in adv and does as it is said in adv.</li>
    <li> While my 10 year old Conair hair clipper still cuts like a knife, I&#x27;ve been getting tired of its limited guard lengths.  After an exhausting search I found only one hair clipper that offered longer settings ... the Philips Norelco 5340.  Despite the single negative review regarding its inability to cut, I decided to give the product a fair try.  I am very pleased with my purchase!  The hair clipper is very well manufactured and extremely easy to use.  I feel very confident that it will provide me with another 10 years of satisfied styles.  In regard to the lack of cutting power, I do agree that it does have fairly weak hair chopping strength.  This doesn&#x27;t bother me though since my old Conair shared the same deficiency.  It simply takes an extra pass or two across my head to get an even cut.  Considering that no other model allows me to have 1-1/2 inch clipped hair, this issue is not a concern for me.  It&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper to replace a corded clipper with individual guard attachments.  After using the same brand of clipper model for about 10 years it did take some getting used to the cordless (or can be corded) clipper.  This model is also more narrow than the clippers I am familiar with.  After 4 cuts I can say I now prefer this over the electric corded clippers of the past.  The Norelco has plenty of power to handle buzzing my whole head, and then going over areas with a smaller guard, and finally guardless.&lt;br /&gt;A couple of highlights:&lt;br /&gt;-Selecting various trimming lengths is easily done by rotating a dial that adjusts the guard distance.  No fiddling with attachments&lt;br /&gt;-The guard head contours to the shape of your head&lt;br /&gt;-1 Charge lasts me about 30 minutes of cut time minimum (without the clipper losing any degree of smooth cutting power - and might last longer)&lt;br /&gt;-No messing with oil, the unit can just be washed off</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for two years now but I&#x27;ve just been using scissors and thinning shears to get the job done. I wanted a little neater of a look and I compared most of the clippers on here before settling on this one because of all the great reviews. I figured I would use it on the back of my head and on the sides, and continue using scissors and shears on the top of my head. I just cut my hair a couple hours ago and it looks great! My favorite thing about this thing is how ergonomic/comfortable it is to hold in my hand and how quickly I can change cut size. I also like that it&#x27;s lightweight and not too loud. My least favorite thing is that it can be hard to cut close around your ears with these clippers given how wide the blade is. Overall, this thing is going to save me a bunch of time over using scissors and I like it a lot!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had whal, remmington, vidal sassoon, but I&#x27;m a convert, its Phillips from now on.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first hair clipper that I&#x27;ve been able to cut my own hair with, it is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the attachments could be stronger, but if this one breaks - I&#x27;m buying another.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Norelco T960 which worked great until the battery finally died (about 5 years). I would have bought another T960, but they&#x27;re not available, so I got a Qc5340. I don&#x27;t like it as much as the T960, but it&#x27;s the closest thing I could find. It does longer hair, up to about 2\\&quot; better than the 960, but then you have to switch attachments to do shorter hair. Even with the shorter attachment on it, you cannot get to the upper part of your mustache (your nose gets in the way). The battery lasts a good long time, but there&#x27;s no warning when it&#x27;s going to die; Lithium-ion batteries go full speed until they die, so this is normal. If this happens, then you can plug it in and use it while it&#x27;s plugged in. The dial for adjusting length is nice. All in all, it&#x27;s a good clippers for hair and beards up to 2\\&quot;, but not mustaches. Still, I&#x27;d buy it again as I&#x27;ve tried other clippers available now and I like this one better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this trimmer several times now. This hair trimmer does everything it says it will do and it does it effortlessly, making using it easy for the user. It also holds a very long charge. I believe it is discontinued, which is a shame, but Norelco Phillips has produced similar models.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting myself for almost 4 years now. Used several different clippers since I didn&#x27;t pay for barber.&lt;br /&gt;Now how I cut my hair is simple, I set No comb or minimum comb setting to fade off the side+back first, then increase the comb length to fade off upper side, then about one inch comb for the top. with This Clipper I don&#x27;t need to change the comb because it is built-in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con-air Clipper with a fastest motor (HC221GBW) is quite good. So I bought it. not as noisy as Magnet Motor but It pulls a bit. [pull&#x3D;slow]&lt;br /&gt;Fast but Not as fast as this one.&lt;br /&gt;This clipper Doesn&#x27;t pull at all.&lt;br /&gt;Philips clippers are known for their battery life.&lt;br /&gt;[there is a similar model from Philips about $8 cheaper, I say if you stick with the cheaper one, performance may be the same but you might have to charge it before use. Li-ion battery hold charge 3x longer]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get this Clipper with 2 attachments, 38 adjustable settings, so it make sense, don&#x27;t be fooled for \\&quot;21pcs Clippers\\&quot;, you only need 3-4 different shapes to compete the simple job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this runs on battery, NO HOT blade panel. Guys: you know what I&#x27;m talking about, don&#x27;t we hate HOT Clipper touch our face? Every-single-time, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I can think of is when you are cutting hair by yourself. at least once, you will accidentally press the power button, it is BIG and quite sensitive. which can be avoided after you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot think of what more I can ask from this clipper as the performance wise.&lt;br /&gt;Philips should include a bigger brush then the toothbrush-size, it is just useless. But it is easy to clean in the water, especially the blade mouth opens for easier cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this one is MADE IN HUNGARY so you know what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;So the bottom line is if you are selfbarber, this is it, and search no more. I usually dont write a review unless they are really good or really bad.</li>
    <li> First time i,ve given myself a haircut. Worked great. My wife thought i would butcher my hair,but she said it was as good as she could have done. She usually cuts my hair. Phillips has a great design on these clippers,they allow someone to cut their own hair with various cutting lengths without changing a lot of comb attachments. I gave this a five star rating because of its design and how easy it was to use. Good battery life,and cordless a big plus. Prompt delivery by Amazon.</li>
    <li> Pretty precise and robust. Cuts very well and lot of stepwise cutting increments. mold in the palm and light to work, never gets me tired during cutting.</li>
    <li> I have used once and I was quite happy and satisfied. I have used Phillips previous model for last 6 years and I was quite pleased.</li>
    <li> I am very happy from this hair clipper. The battery great and keep working for long time, its sharp and good</li>
    <li> This clipper replaced a Remington corded clipper I bought about 6 years ago.  I had planned on replacing exactly what I had with another but the idea of cordless was too good to pass up.  I am pleased with it so far.  I&#x27;m having a little trouble going around my husband&#x27;s ears, it was easier with the Remington.  I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a learning curve but I&#x27;m not complaining as of yet.  We&#x27;ve had it about a month.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a smaller device. The hair clipper is pretty Big physically.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it&#x27;s only Hair Clipper. I was expecting to get other accessories such as Nose/Ear clipper, Beard clipper.&lt;br /&gt;In my previous Hair Clipper I had 5 different accessories that could be put on the device.&lt;br /&gt;On this Philips it&#x27;s only the Hair Clipper. No other accessories.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, ready to use (comes with a charge).  Excellent.  Nine more words required to submit?  Why?  Oh why?</li>
    <li> Great no problems, battery seems to last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for 6+months now and it&#x27;s working great to cut my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s about sixteen months since I got this oilless device. In fact it has exceeded my expectation from all aspects. So easy to use and clean, and battery last for about an hour with ten minutes charging! Twice per month with no issue of any kind, and end up with a neat haircut as in a barber shop. It really saves time and money.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak for durability or longevity, but these clippers were fast to charge and cut my hair incredibly well.  I had come to accept that a cordless trimmer/clipper would only serve to handle clean-ups/in-between touch-ups, not full hair cuts due to the reviews I&#x27;ve read on only units and my own experience with a Wahl 4-in-1 from Costco.  Much like drills/saws/dremels I figured you had to plug it in to get decent power.  However, this Norelco clipper cuts my hair more effortlessly than my plug-in Vidal Sassoon clippers.  Maybe they were cheap to begin with, but I&#x27;m still impressed by how well these work, despite being cordless.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing to note is that the numerical size guides on the attachments do not correlate with the numbered attachments you may be used to.  Thank God I didn&#x27;t set it to 7 and go to work on the top of my head; 13 is more like the 7 on my old pair.  Also, the difference between 6 and 6.5 (for example) is barely noticeable; I click through a couple settings before I attack my head again.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to it and ultimately appreciate the fact that there are only two attachments to deal with; nevermind bypassing the hassle of running a cord across my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Works well and as described.  Like the 2 year warranty as my last Norelco product stopped charging 12.5 months after purchase and it only had 12 month warranty.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best clippers I have used so far. The product works as advertised. The build quality is very good as this is not a cheap Chinese product. This one is \\&quot;Made in Hungary\\&quot;. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> This works really well.  Phillips has really perfected the device with this model.  The charge lasts a long time and the setting for cut length stays fixed when you use it, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally cutting off more than you intended.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper so that I could cut my own hair at home.  It is cordless which makes it very easy to handle (you don&#x27;t have to worry about wrapping yourself up in wires).  The clipper is also very quiet compared to other models that I have used.  It comes with 2 sets of plastic guides.  One of them goes up to about 7/8 inches.  The other one goes to about an inch and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer has mentioned, the only negative that I can see with this clipper are the removable plastic attachments.  They are a little bit flimsier than I would&#x27;ve like.  Hopefully they&#x27;ll be able to hold up to a few years of use.  If it weren&#x27;t for this small issue, this clipper would get 5 Stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a solid clipper and it&#x27;s a good value buy.  Great pair of clippers for anyone looking to save some money and cut their own hair at home.</li>
    <li> Been cutting my own hair and my sons&#x27; hair for a long time and so far (I&#x27;ve only used them a few times) these clippers are doing a great job.  I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase and would buy again.</li>
    <li> Works great for me. I keep my hair pretty short, usually around the 3 setting, shorter around the ears and the back of my neck, and I cut my hair fairly often to keep it consistent. This clipper is easy and comfortable to use. It charges well, cuts great, is comfortable when using (I like the pivoting head), and adjusts easily. I particularly like the adjustments, a thumb roller. Much better than swapping heads. It also cleans very easily. Nothing bad to say about this product.</li>
    <li> The biggest problem with most hair clippers is that the are built with an isolating blade and removable comb plate held in place by two screws.  As most people that have used the traditional type clipper, if the plate loosens, you can end up scalping your hair even if the plastic combs are used to maintain hair length.  The Norelco clippers have a self sharpening blade that cannot come loose.  The combs slide snugly into the clippers and move up and down by rotating a dial to change comb settings.  The combs also pivot ensuring that the combing follows the contour of your scalp.  The best clippers I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Just did a haircut by myself. It is very comfortable using it, feels like part of your own body. Sharp and easy-doing.</li>
    <li> I was nervous buying this as a gift for my husband because as a woman, I know nothing about electric clippers.  He really liked these; they are easy to clean and simple to use.  Good buy for the money.</li>
    <li> This one is the best... I got 5310 2 years ago and I love it. When my dad visited me and he loves it too and he took it home. So i bought this 1 month ago and use it 2 time and this one is even better for the adjustable head...</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two years on a monthly basis and have no complaints!  One of the best investments I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, well made but a bit fragile. Easy to use and clean and does the job. I only use it on the 3 mm setting and cut my hair every week so it doesn&#x27;t have to struggle with big hair. For my purpose just right. Love it.</li>
    <li> The wonderful product, would recommend. It worths the dollars for the first hair cuts for my sons. Easy using, sharp and you can feel the power.</li>
    <li> Shortest setting not short enough!  Probably equivalent to what I usually think of as a #2.  Had to return because the clipper scale incapable of actually cutting a &amp;#34;buzz cut&amp;#34; (pick up the Philips Norelco QG3270 Multigroom Pro for a shorter cut).  However, quality seemed very good and was water washable.</li>
    <li> Good cutter..easy to use....would recommend this if you want something simple that is reasonably priced and you don&#x27;t have lots of room to store.</li>
    <li> This is a great little unit... I  have used it to do a complete haircut on myself... and its really quite good... REMEMBER that there is a dial to set the length ... i found that out afterwards... VERY SHORT HAIRCUT :) ..... But its really quite good.... Highly recommend....</li>
    <li> really not much I can add to the positive reviews here other than to say I also had a good experience with it - to be honest my wife cuts my hair so I have to rely on her perspective as opposed to my own but she says it works great, very pleased and happy with it and makes haircuts a lot easier... it gives a very close haircut but for people like me whose hair grows back fast that&#x27;s great, not necessarily \\&quot;bald\\&quot; just a close military style haircut... I have thick heavy hair and clippers cut through it no problem... definitely use the cheap looking plastic \\&quot;comb\\&quot; type thing that attaches to it though, I was like \\&quot; what&#x27;s this crap?\\&quot; at first and ignored it (shows I&#x27;m a newbie to clippers :P ) , my wife complained about clipper at first cutting too short then when attached plastic items haircut went much more smoothly .... plastic thingie will probably fill with hair and need to be removed a few times during haircut but my wife said it was no big deal...</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace an Oster set that still works but takes up so much space with all the attachments.  used it a few times and I just don;t like it.  Very inconsistent.  Works okay on the longer setting but not so good on shorter setting.</li>
    <li> I was not sure of this item when I first bought it as I have never used a recharging battery powered clipper set. Was worried if it would have enough power to do a full cut and to go through my thick hair without pulling. I waited on this review this long so that it could be used several times. The result is that it has the power and them some to spare. I sit nicely in my chair while the wife cuts my hair. She loves the fact that it is cordless and easy to move around with. I also appreciate that it is cordless as no more choking me with a cord as the wife circles me to cut my hair. LOL!</li>
    <li> Plenty of power and multiple cutting selections. This is a great unit with a quiet, powerful motor and a great feel.</li>
    <li> This clipper has been great.  I give it 4 stars only b/c It is hard to see what setting you are set to and to then remember what setting you did for a particular section (if you need to go back to that setting).  I like how it feels and how it cuts.  It looks good too - nice design. Time will tell how long it lasts, but so far so good.  I shave my head short.</li>
    <li> This cuts hair as good as the more expensive models for just a fraction of the price.  I love that it is wireless so that I do not have to worry about cables getting in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It charges extremely quickly and with all of the adjustments to length, you can definitely find a length that works for you.</li>
    <li> I need hair clipper to DIY my hair, and this hair clipper didn&#x27;t put me down. I must say that I like it.</li>
    <li> It is an amazing value.  In the first month itself I recovered the cost by clipping my children hair.  Not having to mess around a power cord is enormous help for me (at least fifteen minutes per charge).  I would have paid a little more for more power, but for the price no complaints.</li>
    <li> I was looking for quality clippers to cut my 3 year old&#x27;s hair and picked up a Wahl Pro 20 based on all the good reviews here on Amazon. Shortly after unboxing it, I realized I made a mistake as it was way too burly, loud, and had limited range of guide lengths, i.e. #1-8. After all, I didn&#x27;t want to give him a MIL-SPEC haircut just yet. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, here are my views on the QC5340.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Lightweight, ergonomic, and quiet operation (compared to corded beasts).&lt;br /&gt;- Conveniently adjustable comb with generous range, i.e. #1-13, with only two guides.&lt;br /&gt;- Lithium ION battery with switching power supply.&lt;br /&gt;- Washable and doesn&#x27;t need oil.&lt;br /&gt;- Good enough cutting power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Not even a cheap case or bag? c&#x27;mon Philips!&lt;br /&gt;- Clunky with smaller settings when getting in close.&lt;br /&gt;- Swiveling design changes the cutting length ever so slightly (but kids never sit still anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impression is that this is a very well made product, despite a few quibbles. Based on performance and design would have to give this a nearly perfect rating.</li>
    <li> Finally found a cutter that does what it says it will do.  It is very light sand easy to maneuver.  The adjustments work great and it cut nicely.  I would strongly recommend this to anyone who likes a &amp;#34;same level&amp;#34; hair cut for his entire head.</li>
