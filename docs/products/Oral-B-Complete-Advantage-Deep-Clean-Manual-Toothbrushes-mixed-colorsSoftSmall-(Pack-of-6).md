      <li>so I guess they were OK.  </li>
      <li>Love the brush.</li>
      <li>Recommended by our dentist and they have a nice grip and just right head.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, someone else in our household could use these brushes, so we didn&#x27;t have to go thru a return process.</li>
      <li>these are the best toothbrushes for the hard brusher ... can&#x27;t hurt your gums ...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s true.  </li>
      <li>Getting 6 was nice so that I could replace my old one at home, leave one at school, and leave another at work.</li>
      <li>Soft bristles are best for gums &amp; compact/small head reaches behind back teeth better &amp; is especially good for those with smaller mouths.</li>
      <li>They are just right for me.</li>
      <li>The price is just right.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this item title and item pictured are the right match.</li>
      <li>It also means that I don&#x27;t have to go hunting for the right tooth brush every 6 months or so.</li>
      <li>The Oral B Advantage Plus tooth brush has very stiff  bristles and caused a great  deal of pain to my mouth the 2 times I used it.  </li>

      <li>These really suck!</li>
      <li>I can no longer find these toothbrushes in any local store &amp; they are my favorite.</li>
      <li>I use the soft, full size version and find it to work really well.</li>
      <li>It is an absolute joke.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like having a squirt gun where 30% of the stream goes where you are trying to shoot, and 70% goes straight into your face.</li>
      <li>The Oral-B is what my dentist suggested, and buying a pack of 6 from Amazon was a significant savings over local retailers (on the occasion I could find them).  </li>
      <li>The best part of the transaction was that the vendor took the wrong brushes back and gave me a credit.</li>
      <li>Then there&#x27;s the beveled white part that sticks waaaaaaay out at the top of the brush that is specially engineered to destroy all the gums in the vicinity of the tooth you are trying to brush.</li>
      <li>This ordinary brush was appreciated by family members I gifted with each of mine.</li>
      <li>just the right size for a lady who doesn&#x27;t have a big mouth!  </li>
      <li>But what i received is Soft Tooth brush !</li>
      <li>so I was pleased to find these, but they aren&#x27;t quite as small as I was hoping.</li>
      <li>I gave the Oral-B Complete Advantage Deep Clean, Manual Toothbrush only a 3-star rating because it is not what I had hoped for.  </li>
      <li>love it - hard to get in the store</li>
      <li>There is no way they could sell this with a clear conscience.</li>
      <li>Compact head, soft bristles.</li>
      <li>I recommend the Oral-B Sensitive Soft toothbrush instead.  </li>
      <li>For a manual toothbrush, you can&#x27;t beat Oral-B Complete Advantage.</li>
      <li>The size and amount of bristles are about one quarter that of a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; adult sized toothbrush.</li>
      <li>When I ordered the product through Amazon.com, I thought I ordered soft bristles, but the medium ones were sent to me instead.  </li>
      <li>My dentist recommends a soft toothbrush and most commercial soft brushes are still a bit firm.  </li>
      <li>It reaches the back teeth well, and the bristles hold up decently over time.</li>
      <li>For those worried about what they will receive, I can verify that I received 6 of the Oral-B Complete Deep Clean Small Head Soft Manual toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Plus and Advantage Complete, I think, are different.</li>

<li> I mean seriously, what guy isn&#x27;t dying to have three pink toothbrushes?</li>
<li> None of that silly rubber stuff mixed in with the bristles.</li>
<li> The brush head is a bit small</li>
<li> What a waste of money!  </li>
<li> I ordered this because it was said to have a small head.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s so hard to find small headed toothbrushes in the stores</li>
<li> At least one bristle comes off the brush into my mouth every time I brush with this toothbrush.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the worst toothbrush I have ever used. The size and amount of bristles are about one quarter that of a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; adult sized toothbrush. I feel like I am brushing with a childs toothbrush. These really suck! What a waste of money!  Update: 5/23/2011. At least one bristle comes off the brush into my mouth every time I brush with this toothbrush. I&#x27;ve never had this happen with any other toothbrush I have ever used. This product is garbage.</li>
    <li> This is a good tooth brush. This is the same tooth brush my dentist gives me after my check up.</li>
    <li> The extended blue bristles on the sides have a tendency to rip into your gums and cause bleeding.  I have excellent dental health, according to my dentist, so I know it&#x27;s not gum disease.  Oral-B generally makes good products but this one is horrible.  I recommend the Oral-B Sensitive Soft toothbrush instead.  My dentist recommends a soft toothbrush and most commercial soft brushes are still a bit firm.  The Oral-B Sensitive is the perfect one and works great for me; I should have never tried out something new.</li>
    <li> Purchased for the value pack.  Good for a tight budget.  The brush head is a bit small or maybe I just have a big mouth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding compact, softer bristled brushes without getting a brush that&#x27;s so soft it&#x27;s like brushing with a sponge.  The Oral-B is what my dentist suggested, and buying a pack of 6 from Amazon was a significant savings over local retailers (on the occasion I could find them).  It also means that I don&#x27;t have to go hunting for the right tooth brush every 6 months or so.</li>
    <li> I received the wrong product, and I am not sure who goofed. The best part of the transaction was that the vendor took the wrong brushes back and gave me a credit.</li>
    <li> I gave the Oral-B Complete Advantage Deep Clean, Manual Toothbrush only a 3-star rating because it is not what I had hoped for.  But I can&#x27;t say that the given description nor the reviews by other users gave specifically the wrong impression. I ordered this because it was said to have a small head. Its head is shorter than some brushes but not thinner. I needed almost a child&#x27;s brush with a long handle and hadn&#x27;t found one in the stores. This ordinary brush was appreciated by family members I gifted with each of mine.</li>
    <li> These are just like the ones I have bought in the past from a local store, but these are much less expensive.  Perfect all-around toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is the standard toothbrush my dentist (and many others) recommend. Compact head, soft bristles. The price is just right.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;Advantage&amp;#34; is different from the one I used in the States. How come?</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush. The same thing that a lot of dentists give out. I am a grad student that bikes everywhere, so it was convenient for me to order this online. Getting 6 was nice so that I could replace my old one at home, leave one at school, and leave another at work. Now I have 3 extra when I need them. As unimportant as it is, the only drawback is that I didn&#x27;t know what colors I would get. It&#x27;s a 5 star product, but a 4 star process through Amazon I suppose. I mean seriously, what guy isn&#x27;t dying to have three pink toothbrushes?</li>
    <li> This product was designed by an artist trying to make an attractive looking toothbrush. It is an absolute joke. The outer bristles are raised about two millimeters above the middle ones- meaning that you have to gnash them into your gums just to make contact between the middle bristles and your teeth. Then there&#x27;s the beveled white part that sticks waaaaaaay out at the top of the brush that is specially engineered to destroy all the gums in the vicinity of the tooth you are trying to brush. It&#x27;s like having a squirt gun where 30% of the stream goes where you are trying to shoot, and 70% goes straight into your face. There is no way they could sell this with a clear conscience.</li>
    <li> For a manual toothbrush, you can&#x27;t beat Oral-B Complete Advantage. It just feels like it does a great cleaning job and \\&quot;feels\\&quot; good on teeth and gums. I use it as a supplement to my electric--which can&#x27;t be beat. But if you are in a rush or traveling, I hightly recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> The Oral B Advantage Plus tooth brush has very stiff  bristles and caused a great  deal of pain to my mouth the 2 times I used it.  When I ordered the product through Amazon.com, I thought I ordered soft bristles, but the medium ones were sent to me instead.  Be sure to avoid this product---OUCH.</li>
    <li> Better than most I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is NOT the product advertized. Fortunately, someone else in our household could use these brushes, so we didn&#x27;t have to go thru a return process.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I think as they weren&#x27;t for me.  They were a gift.  Have not heard any complaints so I guess they were OK.  There aren&#x27;t any choices for doesn&#x27;t apply so came as close to &amp;#34;no opinion&amp;#34; as I could.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not much to say here - I like these toothbrushes.  I&#x27;ve been using them for years. They are just right for me.</li>
    <li> The product matches the description.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find small headed toothbrushes in the stores so I was pleased to find these, but they aren&#x27;t quite as small as I was hoping.</li>
    <li> I can no longer find these toothbrushes in any local store &amp; they are my favorite. For those worried about what they will receive, I can verify that I received 6 of the Oral-B Complete Deep Clean Small Head Soft Manual toothbrush. It has a #35 head, which was formerly called the compact head. The way this is indicated now is by the &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; printed in the upper left-hand corner of package. The &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;s&amp;#34; in the upper right-hand corner refers to the texture/strength of the bristles. The UPC (including leader &amp; following numbers) is 3 0041085107 1. If this all sounds like a bit much, it is, lol. But it has been so difficult to find these exact toothbrushes &amp; I wanted to make it easier for others who are also looking for them. If you are looking for a great manual toothbrush this one is great. It&#x27;s the one my dentist hands out. Soft bristles are best for gums &amp; compact/small head reaches behind back teeth better &amp; is especially good for those with smaller mouths. None of that silly rubber stuff mixed in with the bristles. End &amp; side bristles are slightly longer to get into indentations, etc. Happy brushing to all!😃</li>
    <li> I feel that it does an excellent job of cleaning my teeth.  Of course only my next visit to the dentist for a scheduled cleaning will tell, but I look forward to it.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this is the worst toothbrush I have ever purchased. The brush head is too narrow to clean efficiently and the handle is so slim that it&#x27;s difficult to grip. The handle kept slipping around in my hand. The area of the handle that was designed for gripping is too close to the brush head and holding the toothbrush at that point is both uncomfortable and unnatural. I&#x27;m impressed with other Oral-B toothbrushes, but this one is terrible.</li>
    <li> Recommended by our dentist and they have a nice grip and just right head.</li>
    <li> When i placed the order, it was for Extra Soft tooth brush, which is hard to find in the store. But what i received is Soft Tooth brush !</li>
    <li> The picture and description are not of the same item that is shipped.  What arrived were six of the Oral-B Indicator model, a flat brush with no tip or outer bristles.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is by Oral-B but not the one pictured. The one I received does the job but I wanted the other model.</li>
    <li> Love the brush. Great for large teeth.</li>
    <li> these are the best toothbrushes for the hard brusher ... can&#x27;t hurt your gums ... love it - hard to get in the store</li>
    <li> just the right size for a lady who doesn&#x27;t have a big mouth!  LOL!  it&#x27;s true.  like these a lot.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this item title and item pictured are the right match. ...same with another Oral B toothbrush here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Advantage Plus and Advantage Complete, I think, are different.</li>
    <li> One of the better toothbrushes I have found. I use the soft, full size version and find it to work really well. It reaches the back teeth well, and the bristles hold up decently over time. I recommend.</li>
    <li> It was not the one I requested.  But I kept them anyway.  Appearently Oral B has discontinued its crossaction brushes.  I cannot locate them anywhere.  The tooth brushes are not the ones pictured.  The retailer needs to change its picture, since that is what I went by to to purchase this item.</li>
