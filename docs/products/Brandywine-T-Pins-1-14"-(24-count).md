      <li>lol..</li>
      <li>they work well though, and price was great..</li>
      <li>The Brandywine T-Pins work great for what I need to use them for.  </li>
      <li>Good quality.</li>
      <li>Perfect for making or styling wigs, it is very study.</li>
      <li>I should read the descriptions more closely</li>
      <li>I like these pins because they&#x27;re strong and well-built for the purpose of holding wigs in place while they&#x27;re being styled.</li>
      <li>Pins are pins they are ok nothing special or special on price.</li>
      <li>The item was accurately described and the photo was an accurate portrayal of the merchandise.  </li>
      <li>Things turned out for the best - the original package was actually forwarded to her, but they were willing to give me a complimentary package even though the shipping mistake was my fault!</li>
      <li>The seller packaged the item securely to ensure that the contents would not get damaged during shipment.  </li>
      <li>Not only are they the right size, but when I found out I had had it sent to her old address, I contacted the company and they had THE best customer service I ever dealt with!  </li>
      <li>These T-pins are very useful when grooming a wig; couldn&#x27;t really do it without them.</li>
      <li>They helped out so much to prevent it from moving around!</li>
      <li>these were just what I needed to hold down the wig, as I styled it to so that it fit my face better</li>
      <li>Their shape is just very versatile.</li>
      <li>They are long enough to secure the wig for styling with no slippage--I only use 4-6 depending on the length of the wig.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s kind of weird</li>
      <li>But they are also very helpful in a number of other areas as well.</li>

<li> Does that I expected them do, I use them on my wig heads to brush the wigs so they can stay on, and they do.</li>
<li> Used this when making wigs, they stay in place and are sharp at the tip to puncture the styrofoam.</li>
<li> The pins are sharp and it took no effort to penetrate canvass or Styrofoam wig heads.  </li>
<li> so half were missing.</li>
<li> Bought these to hold down my wigs while I styled them for the upcoming convention!</li>
<li> they were too small for me.</li>
<li> These are very small.</li>

    <li> I took a gamble on buying these online for a friend, and it paid off!  Not only are they the right size, but when I found out I had had it sent to her old address, I contacted the company and they had THE best customer service I ever dealt with!

    <li> Pins are pins they are ok nothing special or special on price. Just pins. I notice one of them bent putting in the styrofoam head but I thought maybe I just hit something and that&#x27;s just a one time thing but append ending putting it in a Styrofoam head that&#x27;s kind of weird</li>
