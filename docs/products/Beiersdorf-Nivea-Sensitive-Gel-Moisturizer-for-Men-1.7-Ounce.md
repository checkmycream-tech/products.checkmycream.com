<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I picked this up to use in the office for sun related skin maintenance and can&#x27;t use it because of the heavy old lady scent.  I had to throw it out.</li>
    <li> Smells great and definitely helps keep my face moisturized. I use it as part of my morning routine all I use is a very small amount and it&#x27;s enough to last me a good part of the day. People definitely have mentioned they are a bit jealous of my skin cause it&#x27;s softer and smoother.</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on the skin afterwards. Very mild scent, not perfumey or lotion smelling.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, it keeps my skin healthy and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to sooth razor burn that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.  I&#x27;m very glad I bought this.  The gel is very light, it has a  pleasant fragrance (sort of an ocean scent) and it dries quickly. The fragrance is not overpowering.  There is no greasiness yet it moisturizes well.  I&#x27;ve had good results over the past two months and so far it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin like some other products.  My skin is very sensitive, especially after shaving.  So far, so good.  I&#x27;ll update this review if that changes.</li>
    <li> Great mens moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;Great product overall. I received the 1.7floz bottle of Nivea Men sensitive gel moisturizer which was enough to last quite a while. It only takes a small amount to get the job done. The fast absorbing, and non greasy formula made it easy for me to apply and run, with no sticky or uncomfortable residues. The best feature of this product....upon application it really calms any face irritation with a cooling sensation which is quite addicting. This is definitely a product I will continue to use in my daily routine.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really good. I bought a few of them and used them for a year. Very cool and light to go on, there is some fragrance that is pleasant. Overall, a good gel to use as an aftershave.</li>
    <li> Finally got my husband to moisturize thanks to this stuff!!</li>
    <li> The NIVEA Men Sensitive Gel Moisturizer is a decent product. It comes in a nice container that squirts out a good quantity. The cream itself does a good job moisturizing. However it is a little sticky and it gets worse if you use it after shaving.</li>
    <li> This is an extremely good moisturizer for men&#x27;s face, and I always have couple of these in stocks. It works great especially during winter when your face needs extra care from dryness. Smell is very light and I like it. It works great for travel too due to its size and weight.</li>
    <li> This is a lotion and I put it on my face. It moisturizes it.</li>
    <li> Keeps my face moisturized throughout the day. I use this every morning after showering and applying a benzyl peroxide face wash. Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on my face and doesn&#x27;t cause break outs. Has a scent to it, but I don&#x27;t notice it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had acne for 10 years and have been using benzyl peroxide for most of them. Face burning and dryness is common and a lot of moisturizers are nasty to put on or cause break outs or don&#x27;t work that well. They only thing that worked well for me is the Proactive green tea moisturizer and now this. I buy two at a time. Each usually lasts me 2 months.</li>
    <li> Feels nice going on but the scent is a bit overpowering for me.</li>
    <li> it makes my skin burn, and it has a dumb fragrance</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it right after I shave using the Nivea shaving cream. It has a nice smell to it and it makes my chin feel super smooth.</li>
    <li> I am 40, but I still have crazy combination skin: a few very dry areas and a few very oily areas. I have found a few women&#x27;s products that do a nice job moisturizing and giving me an even skin tone for a few hours without causing breakouts. A good moisturizer can actually reduce my oily skin. This is nothing like those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I read \\&quot;sensitive skin,\\&quot; I assume dramatically-reduced or no fragrance. This has a relatively strong smell. I&#x27;ve seen worse, but if you are sensitive to putting fragrances on your face, this is not going to work for you. The aroma is kinda minty/chemical: not offensive but not especially pleasant either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I assume \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; formulas make an effort to prevent clogging pores. I have never used a moisturizer that caused breakouts and clogged pores as badly as this one. If you are even slightly prone to breakouts, avoid this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one good thing about it is that a tiny tiny bit goes a long way. It&#x27;s pretty good as a travel-size hand lotion. I kept it in my glove box until I used it up. It&#x27;s too expensive to use as hand creme.</li>
    <li> I bought this for boyfriend hoping that he would use it since it says for men and it is gel consistency. He has used it twice (mostly after he shaved) and he says it is very cooling and he likes it. I wish it offered anti-aging, vitamin A, Retinol, blemish control....whatever reduces wrinkles, evens out skin-tone and brighten skins.....you know, like women&#x27;s moisturizers....for this I gave it 3 stars....all it is is a cooling gel for men....</li>
    <li> Great scent, non greasy. I use it after every shave, my sensitive skin makes it impossible to use any other shave lotions. I wish there was a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> Niveas Men&#x27;s Sensitive Gel 1.7oz Moisturizer is the most effective facial lotion I have ever used. I actually had given up looking for similar products that work for my type f sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;  Not only does this product leave my skin feeling fresh, healthly, and hydrated --the price is almost too good to be true.  Additionally the pump dispenser allows me to use the product fully which is another big plus.Where have you been all of my life? Great buy- tremedous value.&lt;br /&gt;by Don</li>
    <li> Greasy, uncomfortable: Old adage holds true with this product. If you can&#x27;t fix it; feature it.  I discarded it. Total waste of money</li>
    <li> One of the best products I&#x27;ve used in a long time!</li>
    <li> Good stuff but you dont know you are running low until you are totally out. Buy a backup</li>
    <li> Perfectly moisturizing product with a great light scent.  Like no other product out there and have tried most. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> ok, im not a guy who pays real close attention to his skin or any kind of regimine.  And i hate the face stuff that makes it feel like you just  put vaseline all over your face. Like you go to dink your coffe and the nug slides off your face.  :-)  This stuff is not like that AT ALL.  a smooth clean feeling gel that dries quickly that moistures without making you feel all \\&quot;Greezy\\&quot;  and i like the scent of it.  in addition its not super costly.</li>
    <li> I work in the Aviation field, this will come handy when cold weather come. Even in the summertime, I use lightly on my face. It will protect my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it. Not greasy at all. Will phase out Clinique men skincare.</li>
    <li> I love the way it moist my face.  Not greasy and is so light.  Will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Affordable, it seems that some greasy, fat face after a few hours will be increased, or is not suitable for my skin this skin.</li>
    <li> After trying multiple brands of lotions this is still by far my favorite moisturizer. It helps my skin from cracking in the dry Michigan winter. I would give it full 5 stars it doesn&#x27;t leave a funny stickiness on my hand after using it.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: To confirm this is a new formula. I had zero problems with the old formula. Really wish they would return it to the way it was.    This one is different than the last one I purchased a few months ago. The product looks different too, it has a more milk like appearance. The bottle is slightly different and now states \\&quot;no drying alcohol\\&quot; pretty sure the last bottle I had did not contain alcohol. The few times I used this one it actually burns/stings a little while the last bottle I had did not. I have since stopped using it. I cannot find a current ingredient list, unfortunately the box is now part of the recycling system. Regardless this was a 5-star product prior to the last one I purchased.  Fyi the batch number is 43012476</li>
    <li> This feels a bit greasy when you apply it, but it does help. There are better products out there, but for the price point, this is not a horrible buy. Not the best, but not the worst.</li>
    <li> have tried lots of skincare products over the years and finally found one that is priced right and works great!  Nivea Sensitive Gel Moisturizer has all the features I need in a moisturizer. I am a lifeguard and pool chemicals are murder on my face and cause breakouts. This stuff is just enough to keep my skin from looking dry and can be used under sunscreen and you can use it right after shaving with no &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container, which some may complain about is great for a gym bag or when you travel, as it won&#x27;t squirt out when you don&#x27;t want it to.  One press gives just the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is non greasy and absorbs quickly, especially if you face is still wet and has a slight scent, but the scent disappears rather quickly so if you use another scent they won&#x27;t compete.  With the great price, I will keep using it because it makes my skin feel so good.  I&#x27;d venture to say this product would be good for women too. Simple and effective for sure!</li>
    <li> One of the only products that keeps my face from having razor bumps. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product post-shave for the last week. I am very impressed with it. Goes on easily, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. It stays on all day, and it makes my skin feel good. Also, I&#x27;m not seeing any blotchiness or razor burns sense I started using this product. I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was on sale at Amazon for just over two bucks.  I primarily use it after I shave.  The scent is not too strong and I don&#x27;t care for strong scents (like my wife&#x27;s Bath and Body lotions).  What I like most about the container is that it is a pump style similar to hand washing soap and a pea sized drop comes out so I get the same amount every time I use it.  I&#x27;ll be sure to use this more as winter approaches.</li>
    <li> Really a great product that helps keep your skin glowing in the winter when it&#x27;s dry out. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a really light gel moisturizer, which means that it&#x27;s not oily in application. My skin feels nicer after application, it has a nice light masculine scent. One note: there is no sun protection in this moisturizer (which is very common now in daily face moisturizers) so keep that in mind if you&#x27;re heading out for the afternoon!</li>
    <li> Pretty good, works well, doesn&#x27;t clog pores. My only issue with this is that it does tend to leave my face a little bit shiny, so I use it as a nighttime moisturizer or if I&#x27;m not going out that day. If I don&#x27;t want to look like I&#x27;m sweaty then I use the Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst Hydrating Gel Moisturizer, which does clog my pores a little bit but doesn&#x27;t make me shiny like this does. I know it sounds like I&#x27;m being hard on this but I honestly really do like this. I have very sensitive skin and these two are the only things that work for me.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy/oily like the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; version does.</li>
    <li> I usually would use the Nivea soft moisturizer, but would hate the oily after feeling it would leave only my face. But this gel those def. dry up quick and leaves a cool feeling afterwards. I recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer.  you only need a half of a dime size to really cover your entire face.  I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I love using this product. It feels great and I look forward to using it after I shave. The only potential downside is that it kind of gives your face a sticky feel. It don&#x27;t mind but some people might.</li>
    <li> Bought this because my boyfriend gets dry patches in the winter and wasn&#x27;t too happy about them. He used it daily (with reminders from me as he is definitely not the type of person to moisturize on his own) and the dry patches went away and his skin definitely improved. Didn&#x27;t cause him to break out and did what he wanted it to. Smells like cologne pretty strongly though (he didn&#x27;t mind and I actually rather enjoyed the scent) but it is something to keep in mind when purchasing. Now that the weather is warm and he no longer gets dry skin, he&#x27;s put it away but it&#x27;s definitely something we&#x27;ll come back to once it gets cold again!</li>
    <li> For being part of nivea&#x27;s sensitive line, this stuff burns my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of facial lotion over the years, trying out different brands. After I&#x27;ve tried Nivea Sensitive Gel Moisturizer, I stopped trying other brands because I found the one that gave me no reason to try others any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact it pumps out exactly the same amount (exactly enough for full coverage of a face) with each press, and when it reaches the last dollop, it simply compresses all the way to the end and that&#x27;s it--it&#x27;s totally empty. You don&#x27;t have to dig around or cut the container open for the remaining bits. It&#x27;s also a hard shell container, so when traveling, it won&#x27;t accidentally get squeezed out into your stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When first applied, it feels a bit sticky, but that goes away soon and your face feels supple and hydrated all day. The scent is pleasant too and not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of all that, it&#x27;s priced lower than a lot of the competitor&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product..got him a sample for Christmas and he wanted more. A little goes a long way. Difficult to find in stores but not impossible.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy moisturizer with alcohol.  It&#x27;s drying your skin and making you buy more moisturizer.  I wish this came in a bigger size.</li>
    <li> I use this lotion, on average, twice a day--morning and night. A single pump is enough to coat my face and neck with a thin layer. It absorbs really quickly and has a nice scent. On days that I shave, I precede the lotion with some sort of mild aftershave. This lotion does NOT have any SPF or sun-fighting elements to it, so if you&#x27;re the type that is outside a lot, it may be wise to look elsewhere. I know I should use a lotion with SPF in it, but unfortunately, I tend to break-out whenever I use the stuff. So, I&#x27;ve stuck with this for several years now, and will continue to do so until I can&#x27;t find it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I do use Spf on days that I&#x27;m expecting heavy sun, but I use a dedicated sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real gripe is that I can never tell when it&#x27;s time to reorder. The container isn&#x27;t see-through, so I have no idea how much I have left at a given time. Why do companies do that?!?! Thankfully, this stuff is relatively cheap, so ordering 3 or 4 bottles at a time isn&#x27;t a huge deal.</li>
    <li> A problem I have with some of the moisturizers out there is that it leaves a sticky film when applied.  This stuff, not a problem, it absorbs quickly, and leaves behind a light fragrance.  It does sort of smell like a pleasant light citrus-like soap.  works well, with no complaints.</li>
    <li> I like the gel texture  and how it is quickly absorbed and non greasy. I would give this product 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the heavy fragrance. For a product marketed towards those with sensitive skin, the fragrance is too overwhelming to the point that it gives me headaches after I use it. I want to keep using it, but I just can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s glorified aloe vera gel but I still love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Nice product. Compares nicely to the other more expensive products like Clarion etc.</li>
    <li> Overall a great product. Actually i liked this moisturizer a lot.. and this was my third purchase.. Nice smooth Gel for face.. which doesn&#x27;t make your face look oily or greasy at all.</li>
    <li> For years, the only product my husband could use was Clinique, but then he tried this one - no allergic reaction and a fraction of the cost. Plus with my Prime membership, free shipping! YAY!</li>
    <li> Great product, too small of a bottle.</li>
    <li> got it, like the bottle and how it dispenses the correct amount you need. it feels nice and not too thick like other moisturizers. the only thing i wish it had was a clear part on the bottle so you could see how much is left. other than that, i would def buy again if i find it on sale.</li>
    <li> Forgot to cancel the S&amp;S, but it&#x27;s a good moisturizer for the gym.</li>
    <li> I used this gel around my eyes and cheeks and I&#x27;ve had small to medium red welts there.  They&#x27;ve been there for 4 days after the second application.</li>
    <li> I use this after I shower and my skin always feels great after applying it. It drys fast and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling/look</li>
    <li> This is my favorite after shave and general face moisturizer. Does not cause break out and is not sticky. It dries quickly and keep face moisturized.</li>
    <li> There is not one single guy I know that doesn&#x27;t love this product, made specially for sensitive skin it won&#x27;t ever cause any kind of discomfort au contraire it will leave your face so soft and moisturized, but never greasy since it is a gel formulation that dries down leaving the skin so soft and refreshed, my hubby uses this after shaving, he swears by it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I had to resort to buying it on Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find it at Target or Walmart anymore for some reason.  Everything they sell is a moisturizer lotion and I much prefer the GEL.  My face gets very dry in the winter so I use this at least once per day.  Glad I bought a few bottles of it so it will last, and hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to keep finding it.</li>
    <li> As I note in the title, this gel moisturized the face without leaving a greasy feeling.  At 1.7 oz it&#x27;s very small and the bottle is deceivingly large.  The price is a bit high, but worth it if you can afford it.  I&#x27;d definitely buy it again whenever on sale.</li>
    <li> I believe Nivea product are great for the beauty products.. This one fails.. I dont fell any difference before after using this moisturizer..Anyway here after i dont require this!</li>
    <li> Nice feel. Cools after shave and smells good. Will reorder when needed. Cheaper than stores with subscription and coupon.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. This is one cream I can use both in summer and winter. It hydrates my skin very well and does not feel oily or sticky. I am using it since 18 months and will keep using it till some thing else come up which is better and cheaper which I do not think will come anytime soon.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff but Walmart no longer carries it. Need to find more!&lt;br /&gt;Can anyone help please, thanks!</li>
    <li> This product is similar to the q10 moisturizer. They work well. My only issue is the size and not being able to judge when you are nearing the end...</li>
    <li> This product works great.  Leaves no greasy residue and dries into your skin within 2-3 mins.  Fragrance is subtle.  What I really like about it is the design of it.  One pump gives you just the right amount for face and neck, you never waste any or use to much.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be great for after shave. I tried a little on my face first and noticed an offensive chemical smell. I have a sensitive nose that says no to things that are wrong, like margarine, a little of it on anything will not pass my lips. I worked for a business that made LCD monitors. One smoked one day and I left the room immediately. My throat constricted and had trouble breathing, this got better in ten minutes or so because I left the room right away. No one else left the room but it hit me fast and intense.</li>
    <li> Non greasy, smells good, fast drying. A good moisturizer for the price. As others have noted the only thing that I was not a fan of is there is no way to know if it is almost empty. You know its empty when when you go to use it and nothing comes out</li>
    <li> I rely on this stuff very heavily every winter to keep my face from cracking up and falling off ;-).  Seriously, this stuff keeps your face from drying out and looking flaky and it&#x27;s not greasy.  Keeps your skin feeling very comfortable.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! As some one with very sensitive skin, I often find it hard to buy a good facial moistureizer that claims to be &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; and isn&#x27;t full of SPF or fragrance. This gel is the perfect moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Nivea Sensitive Gel Moisturiser for Men is a good product, not oily or heavy on the skin, but it does give off a quite strong scent, particularly when first applied, which limits my use of the stuff. This lightweight gel disappears rather quickly into the skin, and there have been no unwanted side effects (rash, redness and irritation). If you don&#x27;t mind a blast of perfume, this decently-formulated and inexpensive moisturiser is for you!</li>
    <li> I like this because it is not greasy at all. It&#x27;s a nice light weight face moisturizer. Living in Florida I don&#x27;t need heavy oily products except for a few weeks out of the year. This is great for all other days, it dries within minutes and doesn&#x27;t feel or look greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this product,interesting enough is much cheaper than in Germany were this is produced !!!</li>
    <li> This is what I have been searching for for a while. It absorbs quickly and has a neutral scent. The product keeps your skin pliable even on cold windy days. Nice sized dispenser. Made in Poland.</li>
    <li> I really like this face lotion. My face gets really dry after I take a warm shower, especially in the winter, so this really helps. It doesn&#x27;t leave a oily feeling like some of the other lotions I&#x27;ve tried. Plus it feels great after a shave as well. It doesn&#x27;t smell fruity too, which I like.</li>
    <li> I bought this initially because it was super cheap and got me to five items on my subscribe and save for the month.  However, now that I&#x27;ve gotten it I love it.  It is thick, but goes on very smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy at all, but rather soft and &amp;#34;protected&amp;#34; for lack of a better word.  The smell isn&#x27;t amazing, but it is not unpleasant and is not worth deducting a star from this otherwise great product.</li>
    <li> I have bought this item twice,and I am very satisfied with its quality and price. My skin is oil and I also had ahard time with acne. This moisturizer is gentle and feels refreshing.I used it twice a day in the morning and before sleep.In a word,good for its price!</li>
    <li> I like the scent. It&#x27;s a nice, inexpensive moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find it in retail stores anymore!&lt;br /&gt;This has the best, neutral but clean scent of any face stuff I&#x27;ve ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;I shave my head, and this does a good job of moisturizing it during the winter months without making it a grease slick.</li>
    <li> with the winter months upon us, it&#x27;s impossible not to have dry skin from being inside. This product keeps my skin refreshed especially after shaving, and i just purchased a bigger bottle to last the winter.</li>
    <li> Best facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried. It does not leave a greasy layer after applying it. My skin has never looked better!!</li>
    <li> Light pleasant and not oily on skin ..&lt;br /&gt;Feels good and light all day after applying also gives a bit cooler feel.</li>
    <li> this is the best face lotion i&#x27;ve found....i have somewhat dry and sensitive skin.  found this after months of searching for a replacement for the nivea lotion i used to use that was discontinued....now this has become impossible to find in local stores as well...this is great, not oily, absorbs quickly, feels cool and refreshing, and smells great</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I have SUPER sensitive skin which is also very dry, but this goes on clean and dries quickly while still retaining moisture throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I have stopped writing reviews but this product is that good that I will try again.  Frequently Amazon refuses my reviews because I comment about shipping costs but I do like Nivea Sensitive Gel.</li>
    <li> In general sensitive lotions are perfume free...not sure what is in this but it burns like hell when I put it on after showering. Smell is awful too.</li>
    <li> this gel I bought for my husband. he has very sensitive and soft skin. This product is also suitable for shaving legs, too. I recommend for everybody</li>
    <li> i got these for 2 bucks as an add on and love them. i use them once in awhile but im a guy so idk much about these stuff. it makes your skin less dry. nothing bad about them</li>
    <li> You only need a little bit to cover your whole face and it leaves skin feeling soft and smooth without looking greasy. I always love Nivea&#x27;s products, they&#x27;re really reliable. This stuff is especially good in the winter when skin can get really dry. Easy to carry around, good price, all around good product, would buy again!</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Have gotten several compliments on it already.  Though I like the regular Nivea moisturizer as well, this one smells better and works great.  It is a fairly strong fragrance, so something to be aware of for those that may be sensitive to strong smells.  If it makes any difference, this gel is clear versus the regular version that is white.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiancee and we both love it. It has a silky texture, so his skin is smooth as a babies butt. It&#x27;s not greasy or thick, and a little goes a long way. I need to find something like it for women. The smell is the typical male fragrance, but not too strong. This product is great and I strongly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Hubby likes it.  Bought for him and he&#x27;s pleased.</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer that works for me.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, lightweight and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Best qualities:  This moisturizer is extremely non-greasy.  The scent is also very subtle, it is not loaded with perfume.  It actually gives an immediate sensation of well moisturized skin, once you put it on.  I would buy this again for sure.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and feels nice, but the smell is way too strong for me. It reminds me of a musty aftershave.</li>
