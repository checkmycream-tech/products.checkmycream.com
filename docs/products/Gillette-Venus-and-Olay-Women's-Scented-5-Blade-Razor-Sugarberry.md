<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My legs have never been so smooth and cutless! I loved this razor. Definitely will continue purchasing. Even my husband uses it! My overall experience has been great. Thanks to a program run buy via venus &amp; olay!</li>
    <li> After receiving a free razor from a program with Gillette, I was excited to try out this product. As a long-time Venus user, I prefer using the razor+shaving cream instead of just the razor with the Olay bars (I feel like I get a slightly closer shave when I use shaving cream). In my opinion, I feel like the bars will run out before the razor is completely useless, and therefore will not use it for everyday use. But, I feel like this product is perfect for vacations and travelling when one might not necessarily have the room to pack a razor+shaving cream, or simply does not want to. Although I&#x27;m not a fan of this product for daily use, I think it has a fantastic smell--very fruity--although, I would not recommend this scent to somebody like my grandmother because the smell would be too fruity for her. I also love the bright pink handle, and will be placing my regular Venus blade heads on it after the razor is no longer of any use.</li>
    <li> I love this razor so much! Gillete Venus &amp; Olay sugarberry razor is the best razor I have tried. I actually got this from a program run by this company- for free! Anyways, it smells like a tangy green apple: A scent I love so much! See, this razor helps to avoid nicks. The head swirls and is movable, and the handle has a comfy gel grip. Cute, I might add. However, this razor is a bit slimy(Creepy!) when wet, but you can rinse the slime off. The moisture bars are my new lotion. No more lotion, no more shaving cream! And best of all- a ridiculously close shave with the five blades. Thank you, razor of mine! Now I actually want to show off my smooth legs!</li>
    <li> usually I am hesitant to use a razor with a soap bar it usually leaves me with razor burn/rash.. I tried this razor not only did it smell good but it left my legs with a nice silky smooth feeling.. I also used this to shave my arms and they feeling amazing.. the only thing I dislike about the product is how fast you go through the bar. but definitely worth trying!! :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally use disposable razors, but I received this one free as a promotion from Gillette Venus. I was a little skeptical at first but gave this razor a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;- The sugarberry scent smelled really nice.&lt;br /&gt;- The Olay bar surrounding the razor and the five blades left my legs silky and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;- This product is decently priced for a disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;- The Olay bar surrounding the razor got pretty sticky&lt;br /&gt;- I didn&#x27;t like how big the Olay bar was, it made it hard to get into tighter areas (ex: behind the knees). I had to go back over those areas with my normal razor to get the hairs that this razor missed.&lt;br /&gt;- I got nicked several times trying to  shave behind my knees.&lt;br /&gt;- I also didn&#x27;t like the holder that the razor came with. I have a tiled shower and it still wouldn&#x27;t stick to it for longer than a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overview:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you normally like disposables that have large bars surrounding the razor then this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;If you like razors that are more compact and of higher quality then I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for you.</li>
    <li> This razor smells amazing! It is definitely my favorite out of all the Venus razors. It gave me a very close shave and made my skin feel silky smooth. The best part is you can use this razor without having to use shaving cream! I tried this for free via a program run by Gillette Venus!</li>
    <li> Overall I had a great experience with this razor. I was a little put off by the sparkly packaging - it seems kind of juvenile. However, the product more than made up for it. The handle is very comfortable and easy to hold. I got a really smooth shave without having to use a shaving cream or lotion. That is a huge plus for me. I also really enjoy the sugarberry scent. It isn&#x27;t too overpowering but it is definitely there for those close enough to appreciate it ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this razor and I will be buying refills!</li>
    <li> First impression (before using):&lt;br /&gt;+ I love the packaging. It&#x27;s cute and pink and definitely appealed to me.&lt;br /&gt;+ The scent, wow. It has a fruity flavor that I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experience while using the product:&lt;br /&gt;+ I like how the razor head moves. It makes it easier to shave.&lt;br /&gt;+ Again, the scent was wonderful. It&#x27;s kind of addicting.&lt;br /&gt;+ The moisture bar makes the razor glide easily across my skin. No shaving cream needed!&lt;br /&gt;+ I only had to wash my legs afterward and pat dry. No other aftershave products needed. It was really convenient. I think I took less than 5 minutes to complete both legs and arms.&lt;br /&gt;- I had to go over some spots a few times to get all of the hair off. My hairs were really fine and short so maybe that was the reason why it could not shave it all at one go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product:&lt;br /&gt;+ It left my legs and arms really smooth as if I just exfoliated.&lt;br /&gt;+ I have no razor bumps!  A big plus!&lt;br /&gt;- I spotted some hairs that I missed, but it could be due to me not shaving over the area a second time.&lt;br /&gt;- The scent wore off really quickly. I was hoping it would stay on because it was a lovely scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again?&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me by a program run by Gillette Venus. Yes, I would buy it once the one that I have finishes. I used to buy cheaper razors in bulk that would give me razor bumps and did not leave my skin as smooth as after using Venus &amp; Olay. I&#x27;m definitely making the switch.</li>
    <li> Received free Venus &amp; Olay Razor; before this razor I was looking for something that was smooth, if I run out of shaving cream I am still able to shave. Venus &amp; Olay Razor did it! if you&#x27;re looking for a razor that moisturizes your skin venus would be your perfect match. It keeps your legs smooth and guess what? I didn&#x27;t get one cut! and it has five blades!</li>
    <li> I received this razor run by a program through Gillette Venus and I absolutely love it! The scent is so sweet but not overpowering. I also love the Olay soap that is really moisturizing and makes my legs feel so smooth! I normally get razor burn and bumps from shaving but this one does none of that. It also works well with my sensitive skin. There is a  little holder that comes in the pack which is nice and handy too. I also love the close shave I get thanks to the 5 blades on the razor. It is a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I loved the new Gillette Sugarberry razor !! It smells amazing!! It takes off all of the hair smoothly while leaving a nice scent behind !!</li>
    <li> At first I was afraid to try this razor. I got the razor through a program run by Gillette Venus. I was afraid because of the big bar of soap attached to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a bar soap person so this kind of surprised me. I noticed I had to wet the soap pretty well before the shaving went well. Once I got the razor \\&quot;broken in\\&quot;-my experience went from \\&quot;meh\\&quot; to \\&quot;WOAH!\\&quot; It felt so smooth and nice. I didn&#x27;t get any razor burn like I normally do and my legs felt soft even wihout putting lotion on after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that this razor isn&#x27;t good for ankles, knees, and underarms. I still prefer the Venus razor without a bar soap attached because this kind is too wide for those small areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will keep using this product for my legs but stick to regular razors for my ankles, knees, and underarms.</li>
    <li> Love that I can skip the shaving cream step and makes shaving much more simpler! It&#x27;s a great product and the olay bar is very smooth.</li>
    <li> When I received the razor in the mail through a program ran by Gillette Venus I was not expecting to receive a razor of such great quality.  When I went to shave my legs I reached for the shaving cream and then realized that a shaving prep wasn&#x27;t needed when using this razor because of the moisture bars, how convenient!  While shaving I was amazed by how smooth and silky of a shave this razor provided.  Prior to this experience, I have been using the same type of razor and razor blades for years (which are also more expensive than the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay razor) but I think it&#x27;s safe to say I&#x27;ll be moving on from my old ways and will continue to use this fantastic razor.  As for the downfalls, I haven&#x27;t had to replace the cartridge yet and I feel like since the Olay Sugarberry moisture bar is a part of this razor it may result in going through razor blades faster than normal, being that the moisture bar will deplete faster than the quality and sharpness of the razor.  Also, I did notice that the moisture bar did clump up and form a residue while shaving resulting in a clogged razor.  Other than those few minor setbacks, I love this razor and will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I received this razor in a promotional program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty pleased with quality of this razor, as I have always been with Gillette products.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the blades themselves they provide a good shave, that leaves your skin very smooth. The Olay bars also help with the \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; factor. The only downside is that the Olay bars are completely gone long before I feel like the blades are dull enough to justify changing my razor head.&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical after hearing mixed reviews on the scent, and I&#x27;m fairly neutral on that part of it. I don&#x27;t notice the scent after I leave the shower, and even in the shower I don&#x27;t find it to be repulsive. However I wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way for it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great razor, while the Olay bars last.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this product I got a change to try it through a Gillette Venus Program, and as soon as you open the product up it smells amazing. I got a really close shave and didn&#x27;t have to use shaving cream which was a major plus all you do is wet the razor, it didn&#x27;t take many tries to do the job. It also left my skin feeling smooth and its due to the moisture bar that is part of the razor. Honestly I loved this product and would buy it again. It&#x27;s what you expect and it leaves your legs feeling awesome at night.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! It leaves my legs silky smooth! The scent of the built in shaving cream is amazing. The shaving cream built in is such a time and money saver! The handle fit perfectly in my hand, and it was cute!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this razor. It&#x27;s by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Highly recommend it! I feel so pampered when I use it, and it makes my skin so soft!</li>
    <li> This next product was provided via a program run by Gillette Venus. Most of my products are actually purchased by myself but I could not resist something that is free. I have had Venus razors in the past and couldn&#x27;t wait to review this one. This razor is just like the Schick Intuition (which I tried in the past and hated!) I shave with soap usually because it is cheaper than cream and even if my razor is dull, I rarely nick my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has two moisture bars around the 5 bladed shaver and comes with a cute shower holder so that the razor can hang to dry. The package claims, \\&quot;exfoliates for surface skin renewal and helps replenish skin&#x27;s moisture\\&quot;.  This product is also scented, which is pretty nifty because there are not many out there like this. The instructions said to wet the razor for a light lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I started to shave my legs, I instantly noticed that this would only work for my legs and not areas such as the bikini line or arm pit because of the bulkiness of the bars. The next thing I noticed is that the scent was not too overpowering. I know that when products have scents, there is always a group of people that hate it. I found the smell pleasant and after the shower, it did not cling to my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would just like to put out there that I am Italian so if I do get lazy (always) and do not shave my legs every few days, then I pretty much need reinforcements on my legs. On days that I would be lazy, this razor would be pointless because I would have to constantly rinse the shaver....which means that the lovely moisture bars would dwindle down to nothing within a few uses. I found that the moisture bars were not silky but rather sticky on my legs. Whenever I would rinse my leg, there was a residue from the shaver. After the shower, the shaver hook is useful but I do not like the fact that I NEED the hook in order to try a preserve the product. Hopefully you can tell from the photos that the bars turned into a deformed bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right after the shower, my legs did feel slightly raw and I did find a small nick (I cannot recall the last time I have cut my leg). Sitting here now, my legs do feel smooth but I had to add lotion to make sure my legs did not produce bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for this product but I definitely would stick to my original shaver. There are too many downsides to this product. The only saving grace would have been if the replacement cartridges were cheaper because I would definitely buy this for days when I just want to shave quickly. The \\&quot;moisture\\&quot; bars allows you to shave quickly but the amount of product you lose after each rinse is like money going down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;Final Rating: 5/10bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right after the shower, my legs did feel slightly raw and I did find a small nick (I cannot recall the last time I have cut my leg).

    <li> The best razor I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve tried other razors with a moisturizing bar but they left a sticky residue on my legs even after rinsing off - but the Olay bars were smooth and gave just the right amount of moisture. I got the razor through a Gillette Venus program and was a little skeptical of being able to get around all the bumps and corners with such a big razor, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever gotten such a close and smooth shave so quickly. The head of the razor is flexible enough and the moisturizing bars help glide the 5-blade razor over your skin so that you only have to go over a spot once. Although I don&#x27;t know how quickly the moisturizing bar will last - I&#x27;ve used it three times now and it looks like it has reduced in size quite a bit. Several days after using it for the first time though my legs were still super smooth and it didn&#x27;t look like I had missed any spots -- which was rare with my previous razors. I was done with shaving in record time and legs were so smooth I didn&#x27;t even think of putting on lotion afterwards. Love this razor!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved using the Venus okay razor. This is one of my favorite Venus razors that I have used and I am so glad that I have it now. It makes my legs so smooth.</li>
    <li> I got to try this razor via a program run by Gillette Venus, and for the most part, I liked it! I got a closer shave because of the 5 blades, rather than my usual 4 blade razor. I also liked the fact that I didn&#x27;t need shaving cream because this razor has moisture bars on the top and bottom. But the downfall came when the moisture bars BARELY lasted. I got two awesome shaves out of this razor and then it stopped working as well. For the most part, it&#x27;s still a wonderful razor!</li>
    <li> First let me say I loved this razor! The 5 blades created a clean, smooth shave. I really liked the Olay moisture bars as well. It felt like I was rubbing conditioner on my legs as I was shaving. It was nice not having to use soap or shaving cream while I shaved. The moisture bar made shaving faster and more convenient. I have shaved multiple times with the razor and the blades are still good and the Olay moisture bar is still in tact. They are just overall a good quality.&lt;br /&gt;The only critique is the bar didn&#x27;t have my favorite fragrance. It didn&#x27;t bother me that much because it wasn&#x27;t an overwhelming smell, however.&lt;br /&gt;The razor I tried was provided for free via a program run by Gillette Venus. I would definitely buy this razor next time I need a new one.</li>
    <li> Upon receiving my razor  provided via a program run by Gillette Venus I opened up the packaged and assembled my razor. It was on my shower wall in less than 1 minute! My shaving time was cut down because the moisturizing Sugarberry scented bars on either side of the blades moisturized my legs instead of having to apply a shaving cream or soap. (Yay! Now I don&#x27;t have to buy two products to shave!)The lather did get a bit stringy and thick at times, which I think clogged up my razor, but with a quick rinse it became clean again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor was comfortable in my hand to use, and I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about a week and the lotion bars haven&#x27;t seemed to dissappear too quickly so I think they will last a while. The blades on the razor don&#x27;t seem to have dulled yet either. The fact that there are 5 blades on this razor means I don&#x27;t have to repeat the same spot on my legs as often to get a clean result!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no razor burn and my legs were soft and silky all night long after shaving in the morning each day. My stubble even seemed to me a little less than usual when shaving the next morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all a really good razor!</li>
    <li> Wonderful razor! Leaves my skin feeling soft and smelling amazing! The olay soap stays on the razor great! Should definitely try this razor!</li>
    <li> I JUST GOT MY VENUS &amp; OLAY RAZOR TODAY AND I REALLY FELL IN LOVE. IT LEAVES MY LEGS FELLING SO MUCH SMOOTHER AND SILKIER. IT DOESN&#x27;T LEAVE ANY RAZOR BUMPS. AND I GREAT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN. I RECOMMEND ALL WOMEN TO GET MAKE THIS AN INVESTMENT. GREAT PRODUCT !</li>
    <li> This was a great product and my legs have been hydrated and smooth for a couple days now! Better than similar razors.</li>
    <li> I recieved this razor through a program run by gillettee venus. I was looking foward to trying it out and jumped in the shower when my box came!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I liked the way the moisture bars smell&lt;br /&gt;  I liked the layer of protection that the moisture bars provided&lt;br /&gt;  The flexible head was great for shaving my legs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Leg shaving is all this razor is good for...anywhere else and the moisture bars get in the way and everything gets awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all a great product for leg shaving!</li>
    <li> Being a mom I seldom have time alone or to do things without my 6 month okd not to mention a lot of time to spend in the shower. This product saves time by having soap already on the razor and a tilting head to quickly run over ever curve! The shower holder that accompanied it is also very handy! The best part was I got this from a program ran by Gillette!</li>
    <li> This is the only razor that works on my sensitive skin with no shaving cream. I got this razor through a program through Gillette venus. It is a great razor. leaves my legs feeling smooth and looking shiny. The only complaint I have about the product is the soap bar should be a bit bigger. overall a great razor. I would recommend this to anybody with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product just wish that the holder it comes with the razor would stay up and not drop off the tile wall every 2 minutes.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say from personal experience(being a guy and all) how well it worked, but I can tell you my wife&#x27;s legs and smooth and yummy.  Sugarberry yummy!</li>
    <li> Loved this razor for the summertime! Or anytime! Eliminates any need for shaving cream, the bar surrounding the blades is super hydrating and soothing, and works a lot better than any shaving cream I have ever used. This razor left my skin so nice and smooth, my legs were not left dry and irritated like many razors do to me. I especially think this is great for the summertime, it makes shaving so quick and easy and would be perfect for anyone on vacation. I was sent this product to review by Gillette Venus and I am so glad I was able to try it out, because I am never going back to those crappy disposable razors again. Overall, this is a great product and I love the fact that it comes with a suctioned holder so your razor stays in one place and doesn&#x27;t always end up by the drain.</li>
    <li> I usually wax because shaving doesn&#x27;t get my skin very smooth, but the five blades on the Venus &amp; Olay razor really did it for me. It was given to me through a Gillette Venus program, but I&#x27;ve already bought another one. I would highly recommend this product if you don&#x27;t wax but want smooth hairless skin in little time.</li>
    <li> (Using my bf&#x27;s account, giving a review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this via a program run by Gillette Venus and needless to say I was excited! Quick, effortless and smooth shaving comes along with this razor! No more shave gel means no more mess, no more after shower moisturizing which means less time getting ready and overall no more fuss! I give this razor a 5 star plus a thumbs up, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased(:</li>
    <li> I loved this product because it eliminates the need for shaving cream. The blades work really well, giving you a very clean shave and the moisturizing bars make you skin smooth and silky while you are shaving. I really recommend this product to women.</li>
    <li> Through a program run through Gillette Venus, I got to try out the razor. I was really looking forward to trying the item because it had built in moisturizers so I would not have to mess with using any shaving cream. That is really what I liked most about the razor. The only bad thing is that its 5 blades don&#x27;t really keep my legs any smoother than any other competitor&#x27;s 4 or 5 blade razors.</li>
    <li> I received this razor via a program run by Gillette Venus and I am so glad I did. I usually have issues with razors causing me to have break outs but this was a completely different experience. The five blades and Olay bars left my skin so moisturized and smooth. I will definitely be purchasing more of these razors.</li>
    <li> I liked the quality of the razor itself. The soap being on the razor was an added bonus. I didn&#x27;t care for the scent, but that isn&#x27;t a big deal. The refills are a bit pricy, so I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing this item. Thanks to a program run by Gillette Venus.</li>
    <li> I love this razor my legs haven&#x27;t been this smooth this long EVER! Defiantly my new razor! Recommended to all my friends</li>
    <li> I used the razor last week and today my legs are still silky smooth. All my life I have had to shave my legs once a week usualy and by the middle of the week my legs are so dry and ichy that i cant stand it. Totally the best razor ever!!!</li>
    <li> I was sent the Venus &amp; Olay Razor via a program run by Gillette Venus. The blade is cuts really close , I really liked how the product made my legs feel. I do think it&#x27;s a little too much , the gel only lasted a week but my legs feel great .</li>
    <li> This razor smells amazing! But it&#x27;s also difficult to use because it is bulky and the moisture strips are very slimy. I had to use shaving cream anyway which defeats the purpose and ended up taking the strips off. The razor itself is really good tho</li>
    <li> I loved this razor! Just tried the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Razor in Sugarberry which was provided to me via a program run by Gillette Venus. I am a College student in sunny California and with this beautiful weather comes allot of leg showing... so I have tried many different kinds of razors believe me.&lt;br /&gt;  OK so enough about me let me tell you what I liked and what I didn&#x27;t about this razor:&lt;br /&gt; Likes: -Didnt have to use shaving cream!&lt;br /&gt;  -The built in shaving cream and moisturizer made the shaver glide over my skin.. including my knee area which I usually am very&lt;br /&gt;  sketched out about shaving over because of the angles and rougher skin&lt;br /&gt;  -It smelled AMAZING! They need to make a lotion or a perfume out of it!! It smelled like sweet mouth watering candy.&lt;br /&gt;  -my legs got such a close shave, and they feel super smooth with the Venus 5-Blade technology&lt;br /&gt;Dislike: -Ok.. I know this isn&#x27;t good but sometimes I dry shave when I am in a rush and the two flaps of the moisturizer/shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;  made dry shaving nearly imposible.&lt;br /&gt;  -you have to make sure that you hang up the shaver after using it in a dry area or else the moisturizer flaps goop and loose&lt;br /&gt;  some of the cream.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. It makes shaving fast and convenient. No need for shaving cream! I love the scent and the shower hook. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying refills for this razor!</li>
    <li> After receiving this razor that was run by a program from Gillette Venus, I immediately hopped in the shower to try it out. I discovered no other razor i&#x27;ve ever tried has made my legs feel smoother or provided as much moisture as this one did. My favorite part about this razor is having the option to not use shaving cream. The sugarberry scent is just a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest to NOT hang your razor in the shower or keep it in the bathroom at all. It won&#x27;t rust as fast if you keep it in a cool dry area.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the kind of girl who shaves my legs dry because I do not want to spend the extra time lathering up with shave gel. This typically results in knicks, razor burn and super dry legs. Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised when I received this razor last week via a program by Gillette Venus and realized the Olay moisture hars were built in and that shaving gel was no longer needed. At first I felt that the razor was not working as I could barely feel the blades on my skin as I do with other razors but all of the hair was removed once I was finished. I always cut myself the first time I use a new razor and after using the Venus &amp; Olay razor, my legs were soft and smooth without any knicks or razor burn. Shaving is no longer a painless and lengthy process with this razor.</li>
    <li> this is the best razor ever I absoulty love everything from venus.. I have all the razors and this will forever be my razor I go to.. I recived one from a program by venus to make a review and im in love</li>
    <li> This is such a GREAT razor! It does everything it says it does! It makes shaving such a breeze, and that is abnormal for me. I always have a difficult time shaving. I can never get a close shave and I find that other razors damage my skin. This razor actually moisturizes my skin  and gives me a close shave. This gives me silky smooth legs! And I love how sweet the razor smells. It&#x27;s such a great razor and I love how it comes with a razor holder.&lt;br /&gt;I just love this razor!</li>
    <li> I waited a good two weeks before giving my personal opinion to get the full effect of the product so that i didn&#x27;t give any wrong information. To start off i&#x27;d like to say that i was chosen to receive a free razor provided by a program run by Gillette Venus but i was not paid to do this review so this is my 100% true opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging when i first received this product was very nice, it had a nice shimmer effect to it, and made me not even want to open it at first haha. To be very honest, the packaging was a little tricky to get into but overall it wasn&#x27;t as hard to get into as some other things I&#x27;ve purchased before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first thought when i removed the handle was the nice \\&quot;No Slip\\&quot; grip it had to it, even while i was using it the water from my hands did not make it slip, it stayed in place without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual razor attachment itself is amazing! There were five blades, and two moisturizing bars on each end. Mine was the \\&quot;sugar berry\\&quot; scent which smelled so sweet but wasn&#x27;t overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Blades kept my legs smooth for about 2 days, which for me is pretty impressive, i also noticed that because of the moisturizing bars i did not have to put lotion on my legs after i showered, you can also opt. out of using shaving cream since the bars provide enough moisture to shave with, but i prefer to use it, so i did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the package i also received a shower hook, which made me very happy because i&#x27;m a girl and girls have all types of soaps, shampoos, body washes, etc. that clutter up the shelves of a shower, So the hook was very convenient and stuck extremely well (It hasn&#x27;t fallen once!) I also feel that the razor hanging promotes less bacteria growth on your razor and makes it last longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to a friend, and i will be repurchasing the cartridges for this razor in the near future.</li>
    <li> I usually get a wax to remove the hair from my body, but I received this razor through a promotional program run by Gillette and decided to give it a try. I found that it really works. I did not have to use any shaving cream because the Olay moisture bars helped the razor just glide across my skin and allowed it to give me a super close shave. I enjoyed the scent, although it could be a bit stronger for me. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a fragrance left on my legs, but I am sure some people prefer that. I haven&#x27;t cut myself once since I&#x27;ve used this razor, either, which is a miracle for me! Definitely going to be buying this razor again instead of going for my usual wax. It saved me time and money, which is always a great thing.</li>
    <li> I used this product and it was worth the money to me. I loved that it came with a hook to hang on the shower, I also love how smooth it made my legs. This is not the razor for someone who doesn&#x27;t like to spend money on smooth legs, this razor did not last but one shave but it was worth it with how smooth my legs are :)</li>
    <li> The razor was provided via a program run by Gillette Venus. This product is amazing!!! It left my legs feeling smooth and beautiful, not a hair in sight! The olay moisture bars with the sugarberry scent made my shaving experience even 10x better. I would recommend this product to every woman.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always hated using shaving cream in the shower. It&#x27;s near impossible to find the spot in the shower where you can both keep your body in the water and avoid washing away the shaving cream from your legs. Plus, in my current apartment, we have a claw foot tub and there&#x27;s not even a place to prop my leg up. It&#x27;s a serious situation. Just when I thought I would have to suffer through my first world problems forever, the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Razor showed up at my door step, provided via a program run by Gillette Venus. Since the soap is right on the razor, I don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream anymore! It also helps me shave quicker, which saves me on the mornings when I press the snooze button one too many times. However, I don&#x27;t think I get as close of a shave with the Venus &amp; Olay Razor, because I can feel the stubble pretty significantly the next day after shaving. That&#x27;s okay, though- I&#x27;m willing to shave more frequently to continue to bask in the convenience and ease of the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Razor!</li>
    <li> I like it when trusted brands team up to create a better product, and this is definitely one of those times. I got one of these razors through a program run by Gillette Venus and I was glad I got to try it! It gave me a close, smooth shave that didn&#x27;t require messy shaving gel. The moisturizing bars were really convenient and left my legs feeling smooth. The only things I had issues with were the excessive packaging and the fragrance. What the heck is a sugarberry? Hopefully they will come out with more scents as this was not the one for me. All in all, I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> The razor was provided to me via a program run by Gillette Venus. Overall, it was a good shaving experience. I liked how it contoured and pivoted on my legs. It&#x27;s nice to not have to use any shave cream/gel, however, for me there just wasn&#x27;t enough lather, so I used soap as well. Overall, it provides a nice, clean, and easy shave.</li>
    <li> I do wish the blades were a bit more bigger because my hair grew back too fast with this product, but overall it&#x27;s been wonderful. I love the fact that I don&#x27;t need to use shaving cream. The replacement bars are very expensive which is lame, but I might consider repurchasing this product. This product is really great for the underarms though. I would recommend this to everybody!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice razor. I like that it exfoliates as it shaves and love the scent. Not sure it locks in moisture but my legs don&#x27;t feel as dry as they normally do during the summer. The soft-grip handle makes for easy control and the razor cartridge lasts for a month - a big bonus since these cartridges are so expensive to replace. Another bonus: the shower holder so it can be within easy reach. Very good price here at Amazon!</li>
    <li> I was lucky to be able to try the Venus &amp; Olay razor in Sugarberry for free, thanks to a program run by Gillette Venus. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and this razor is awesome! The moisture bars are great, I love that you don&#x27;t need to use shaving cream, which quickens the process. The 5 blades just glide along your skin- it barely feels like you&#x27;re shaving, and the exfoliation they provide leaves your skin feeling extremely soft.  I haven&#x27;t nicked or cut myself at all, it seems impossible to do with this razor. And the smell is really nice, the only downside is the regular cost of the cartridges-I&#x27;d love to keep using this but they are pricey! Overall, another great product from Gillete Venus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received this razor via a program run by Gillette Venus. This razor was the best I&#x27;ve ever used. The product moisturized my legs quite well and the multiple blades made my legs silky smooth. I also enjoyed the scent of the product. It was noticeable, but not overpowering. This product seems to provide an all-in-one solution to shaving your legs.</li>
    <li> I received this razor in a trial program run by Gillette Venus, and I was quite impressed! It gives a really close shave very easily, and I liked the sugarberry scent. The moisture bars are really convenient, and I really appreciated not having to use any extra shaving cream. The one downside to this product is that the moisture bars don&#x27;t last as many shaves as the razor would, so you either have to change blades more often or just use it without the moisture bars (and with extra product) after they wear away. Overall, though, this is a great product, and it&#x27;s also really convenient because any Venus razor blade can be used on the same handle, allowing you to try out different products and also just buy whatever is convenient or interesting instead of looking for a very specific type of cartridge that might be sold out or something.</li>
    <li> This razor was provided to me via a program run by Gillette Venus. I have to say that I really like this razor a lot. I&#x27;m going to mention the one negative thing first and say that the soap inserts can get in the way and are annoying at times. Now on to the good. It&#x27;s really convenient not having to use shaving cream. I can hang it up in my shower (awesome), and it makes for a smooth, clean shave.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with Gillette all over again! I got the razor through a program run by Gillette Venus. I&#x27;ve been using this new razor for about 3 weeks now and I&#x27;m loving it. The first time I tried it I had run out of my shaving gel, but I had no patience to go out and buy it, so I tried the razor just the way it was - with water in the shower. And it was heavenly. So nice and smooth. Those Olay Moisture Bars just eliminate the need to use any additional shave creams, gels, etc. It&#x27;s mess-free and it saves time! It&#x27;s perfect for travelling, I&#x27;ll be taking it with me on my vacay this summer. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a complimentary program run by Gillette Venus and I loved it! I am already a big fan of Olay soap so combining it with a razor was brilliant. It was easy to use and definitely perfect for making those legs nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor! I hate having to use shaving cream and love that I don&#x27;t have to with this razor!! My legs were so soft and smooth after using this razor! My legs usually get dry after I shave but they don&#x27;t when I use this razor!</li>
    <li> This razor was provided to me by a program ran by Gillette Razor. The packaging was very chic &amp; easy to open. I love that it came with a hook to hang the razor on. I&#x27;m big on scent so I was very pleased that the Sugarberry scent wasn&#x27;t overpowering but it was nice and light. As for the razor it left my skin very soft with a little glow. The blades glide smooth against the skin without that snagging or scraping feeling you get with other razors. Overall this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I was sent the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay razor in Sugarberry via a research program run by Gillette Venus wanting to get feed back on the product. I can honestly say that I will be buying this razor from now on. I liked it that much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisture bars on this razor are definitely a lot better than other brands of razor I&#x27;ve used with the same concept. They are just the right thickness to leave the moisturizer on your skin, but aren&#x27;t so thick that they get in the way. And thanks to the moisture bars, you don&#x27;t need shave cream! I loved this part! It&#x27;s awesome when you&#x27;re in a hurry and don&#x27;t have a lot of time to shave. And, thanks to the 5 blades, you don&#x27;t have to worry about going over spots 2/3/4 times. I don&#x27;t think I could switch to a 3 blade again! My skin is so smooth and silky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the scent of the moisture bars. Although it&#x27;s called \\&quot;Sugarberry\\&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t really smell like berries. But it&#x27;s still a very nice, light scent that I think any woman could appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate that Gillette gives you a razor holder with the Venus &amp; Olay razor. It was a little added bonus that I wasn&#x27;t expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I can find with the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay razor is that the moisture bars wear down pretty quickly (the reason I am giving this a 4 out of 5 stars). If you&#x27;re an every day shaver (think of all those sleeveless summer nights), you will probably be switching your blade every week or so. I did read somewhere that you want to switch out your disposable razors every week, anyway, so this may not be a totally bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I really liked the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay razor in Sugarberry and would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I received this razor via a promotion ran by Gillette Venus. It has a nice handle, the blades are awesome, and the moisture bars smell amazing. Thanks to the moisture bars, it makes shaving super fast since lathering your legs isn&#x27;t necessary. Some of the downsides are the fact that the replacement blades are a bit costly and seeing as the moisture bars diminish quickly, basically taking the whole novelty of the product away, you&#x27;ll have to replace before the blades expire. Overal it&#x27;s a good razor and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who is crunched for time with a disposable income.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to razors just because I&#x27;ve tried them all and nothing seems to last and long or leave my legs as smooth as Venus and Olay razor I recieved it through a program Venus and Olay were running and the fact that play is working with it makes it moisturizer my legs better and the shave lasts for days I can&#x27;t complain the only thing I would say is make sure you don&#x27;t leave it thrown around because the soap will minimize fast but that&#x27;s what the suction cup is for, I think it&#x27;s a great razor it does a great job and it&#x27;s less time you have to worry about shaving</li>
    <li> I was provided a razor through a program run by Gillette Venus and I am so grateful. This Venus and Olay razor kit blew all of my old razors out of the water. It left my legs feeling silky smooth and I didn&#x27;t have to use very much shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from Gillette and I really liked the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Sugarberry Scent Razor! It was great for a close smooth shave. It also made shaving much more efficient. Not having to use shaving cream or lotion surprisingly saved so much time! My only problem with the razor was that the soap part of it did not last as long as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! I received it as part of a program run by Gillette Venus, and I truly cannot say enough about it. I have very sensitive underarms and because of that, I can only shave every three days or so. Because of this razor, I can shave every day! And my legs, my legs! So smooth and lovely. I love that I can just pick up my razor and go, as opposed to hassling with the shaving cream and such. And the scent is an added bonus!</li>
    <li> I love how there is no shaving cream needed so it&#x27;s 2 in 1. Very quick &amp; easy to use. Would be ideal for traveling too. The smell is great!!! This left my legs feeling amazingly silky &amp; smooth.</li>
    <li> After trying this product provided via a program run by Gillette Venus, I would have to rate it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros of this product:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to handle and use.&lt;br /&gt;- The razor smells amazing. It had a very sweet scent.&lt;br /&gt;- The Olay moister bars hydrated my skin, leaving my legs moisturize for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Can be expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love this product! It leaves my legs feeling soft,  moisturize and beautiful. I will definitely continue using this product!</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome! I really loved the lotion bar on it! It left my skin feeling smooth and awesome! I got the razor through a program via gillette venus. I absolutely recommend this razor. I have sensitive skin and most razors leave little red bumps and this one didnt! Love, love, love the sugarberry scent as well! I have found my new razor!</li>
    <li> I just used a Venus razor for the first time last week. I got it for free from a program via Gillette Venus. I loved how smooth my legs felt afterwards and how much quicker and easier it was than using shaving cream. The shave was ridiculously close and somehow I walked away without a scratch. Great product!</li>
    <li> Packaging:&lt;br /&gt;A little bulky and unnecessary, the razor is small and it only came with one blade. It was quite hard to get into also, but honestly packaging doesn&#x27;t really bother me because most people just throw it away as soon as they get the product so this wasn&#x27;t much of a concern, just a minor annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Physical Product:&lt;br /&gt;What I really enjoyed about this razor was that it had 5 sharp blades and you could definitely tell you were getting a close shave and I definitely got a super close shave the first few uses!&lt;br /&gt;I also liked that the handle wasn&#x27;t too bulky or awkward to use. It didn&#x27;t take up a bunch of room in your shower which was nice.&lt;br /&gt;The in-shower storage holder was worthless. It literally fell three times and I finally just gave up on using it. The suction cup on the holder just didn&#x27;t hold up at all. The awesome thing about it though was that the moisture bars didn&#x27;t budge even though the razor kept falling! I was pretty surprised how sturdy they were and I wasn&#x27;t expecting that.&lt;br /&gt;The pivoting head on the razor was super flexible and made it easy to get every part of your leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travel:&lt;br /&gt;If you travel quite a bit, there is honestly no good way of taking this razor with you. I went on a business trip and couldn&#x27;t bring the razor because it has no protective covering for the blade head. I was too afraid the shave bars would fall off in my suitcase so unfortunately I had to leave it behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More on the moisture bars:&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the bars smelled amazing. When I first saw the name of the scent before smelling it I was a little worried it would be sickly sweet, but it was definitely a pleasant smell and thankfully the fragrance didn&#x27;t irritate my legs.&lt;br /&gt;As far as it having Olay(tm) moisturizer in the bars, I wasn&#x27;t impressed. I have a problem with my legs getting super itchy after a shave if I don&#x27;t use any moisturizer after (and sometimes that doesn&#x27;t help). I was expecting this product to feel moisturizing and reduce the need for a ton of moisturizer slathered on my legs. Compared to other razors, it did a little better with not being so itchy, but it was honestly nothing amazing. I was quite disappointed by that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use:&lt;br /&gt;I have used competitor brands&#x27; razors that feature moisture bars so I knew what to expect and what to look for in a good razor with moisture bars. If you have never had the chance to try out a razor with built in shaving cream, they are a MUST HAVE! You reduce your shaving time in half and the Gillette® Venus was no different. Since there were five blades, I got a seriously close shave the first few times of use.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, after a few uses the moisture bars started to wear quite a bit and the last time I used it, I had to go over my legs with another razor because the shave wasn&#x27;t as good. Gillette® claims that the razor blade head is supposed to last up to a month, key words \\&quot;up to\\&quot; because they definitely didn&#x27;t last me a month! I have to shave every few days and found myself using other razors because the moisture bars wore so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another few things I don&#x27;t really enjoy about the moisture bars is that they can only really be used for your legs and underarms. If you want to shave your bikini area for summer, good luck with that. I own four razors because I have ones with moisture bars and ones without for different areas.&lt;br /&gt;BUT I think its completely worth having a razor with moisture bars because I definitely don&#x27;t want to mess with shaving cream (an extra expense and waste of time) if I don&#x27;t have to! With the moisture bars that step is taken away and like I said earlier, you LITERALLY reduce shaving time in half!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the moisture bars can wear pretty quickly, its something to expect with this product. I think this product is good, nothing amazing and has room for improvement, but overall they made a good razor. The five blades and non-bulkiness really beat the competition,but there are some things that could be improved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy refill razors for this product and continue using it? Probably, but it has a lot of room for improvement. Its an awesome concept, but I think to beat its competitors it could improve a lot more! But then again, the competitors need a lot improvement too. Its definitely a good contender for a razor that features moisture bars though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent the Gillette® Venus and Olay(tm) razor via a program run by Gillette® Venus for my HONEST review.but there are some things that could be improved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy refill razors for this product and continue using it? Probably, but it has a lot of room for improvement. Its an awesome concept, but I think to beat its competitors it could improve a lot more! But then again, the competitors need a lot improvement too. Its definitely a good contender for a razor that features moisture bars though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent the Gillette® Venus and Olay(tm) razor via a program run by Gillette® Venus for my HONEST review.</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing. It left my legs smooth, and really reduced the time it takes to shave. It made shaving a quick and easy process compared to other razors, and even left my legs smoother for a longer period of time. It really helps moisturize your legs. My razor was a free sample provided to me from a program run by Gillette Venus, but I would buy another one in a heartbeat, and I intend on buying one soon. One thing I wish I knew about the product prior to testing it out would be what exactly the scent of sugarberry is, which I didn&#x27;t love, but I also didn&#x27;t hate it either. I definitely would recommend this razor to anyone who is looking for a razor that not only gives a close shave, but moisturizes your skin in the process.</li>
    <li> I received the Venus &amp; Olay Razor in Sugarberry via a program run by Gillette Venus. After using this razor for two weeks, I have decided to give it four stars. The package that the razor came in included a razor handle, a cartridge, and a shower hook. The cartridge was very easy to snap onto the handle, and in addition, it had a lovely Sugarberry scent that added a nice touch to the razor! The shower hook was a perfect addition for me as well, as I am always just leaving my razor lying around somewhere in the bathroom - now I will know where my razor is at all times! This razor was very easy to use with its soft grip handle and its five blades. It provided a smooth, clean shave on my legs. However, I noticed that when I used the razor under my arms, it took a couple more tries to get a clean shave, possibly due to the bulky Olay Moisture Bars that are attached to the razor getting in the way. Other than that, I felt that this razor did its job quite nicely! As I stated, Olay Moisture Bars are attached to the cartridge itself to \\&quot;help lock-in moisture to your skin for less dryness,\\&quot; as Gillette claims on its packaging. The bars do indeed keep the skin moisturized, as even without the use of shaving cream, my skin felt quite soft still hours after shaving. My skin usually feels very dry and unpleasant if I do not use shaving cream, but this was not the case with the Venus &amp; Olay Razor. However, I do not feel as if this aspect really impressed me enough to want to switch from my usual razor to this specific one. Furthermore, the Venus &amp; Olay Razor and its replacement cartridges are quite expensive. Therefore, while I very much enjoyed using this razor, unless I find a great deal on the razor and cartridges in the future, I will probably stick with my current razor and shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a Gillette Venus program. I typically don&#x27;t have much to comment about razors, as they hardly ever spark my attention, but this was was pretty amazing as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: One of the major pros-- NO razor burn! I think this was the highlight of the product. I always, always get razor burn on my calves, so I was pleasantly surprised when I avoided it this time. Also, the razor I used was \\&quot;sugarberry\\&quot; scented and it smelled great. I really liked the fact that shaving cream was NOT required. I hate dealing with shaving cream- it&#x27;s always a huge mess to deal with. The razor itself glided smoothly over everything, without any weird scratchy feelings or cuts. My skin was super soft afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: The cartridges are somewhat pricey to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this overall.</li>
    <li> The Venus &amp; Olay razor is awesome. I always have trouble nicking myself, even when using regular venus. No problems with this one, plus it smells awesome and leaves your skin so soft. Great product will definitely purchase in the future!</li>
    <li> I really liked using Gillette&#x27;s Venus and Olay razor. The blades gave a nice close shave and the Olay moisturizer made the shave very easy leaving my skin very soft.</li>
    <li> LOVE this razor!! I hate razors and usually cut myself. Most razors never work and I never get a perfectly smooth shave, until the Venus &amp; Olay razor! Never knicked myself, my skin felt amazing and my legs smelled great. The moisture strips don&#x27;t wear down like similar type razors and lather up great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am notorious for buying cheap razors because they work just as well as other typical razors for me. I don&#x27;t like to invest in products unless they have proven worth my hard-earned money. I only tried this one because it was provided to me by Gillette Venus. This razor has warrented continued use and I have no plans to buy any other razor now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely LOVE this!!</li>
    <li> I recently recieved this razor in a promo done by Gillete Venus.&lt;br /&gt;And I must say that this razor is a great razor for the shaving of legs and other large areas on your body.&lt;br /&gt;Although the moisturizing head is bulky and doesn&#x27;t work great for smaller places. it is over all a good razor though and if you want to you should def. go out and purchase one of your own to try out.</li>
    <li> I really must say I was quite impressed with this razor. Other razors i have tried with the moisturizing strip have always either clogged up, or the strip breaks off or is gone by the second shave. With this razor the moisture lasted a long time and left my legs feeling not only moisturized after the shower, but silky smooth all day long. This is for sure, going to be my razor of choice in my shower from now on, and I will be sure to stock up on the Sugarberry scented one because it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I love this product ! it&#x27;s one of my favorite razors. It keeps my legs silky smooth while hydrating . I get a close shave without getting cut. I don&#x27;t have to hassle with shaving cream. I love to use this razor in the shower because its perfect for my busy life style.  the only draw back is the razor is really delicate.</li>
    <li> I received a Venus&amp; Olay razor in the mail as a promo from Gilette. I am in LOVE with it. The shave gel bars makes having a breeze because there&#x27;s no longer any need for soap or shaving cream. My legs are still smooth and soft a day and a half later and I have no irritation which I usually get after shaving. It also has a wonderfully refreshing Berry scent that makes it all the more enjoyable. Ladies this is a must have!</li>
    <li> I received the Venus &amp; Olay razor as a trial in a Gillette Venus program and I&#x27;m glad I did. Typically I have to use a lot of shaving cream (even with the \\&quot;pre-lotioned\\&quot; razors) and apply lotion afterwards. This razor had all of the things I already loved about the original Gillette Venus razor, but the moisturizer puts it over the edge. I saved time and money because of this product. The scent wasn&#x27;t great, but it doesn&#x27;t last afterward so I&#x27;m not worried about it. It left my legs completely hydrated and nick-free! I will definitely be purchasing the refills.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an owner of a razor Venus &amp; Olay by Gillette. It was my first try of this type of razors by Gillette, so it was something new for me. The Venus &amp; Olay Gillette razor was provided via a program run by Gillette Venus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ 1. It&#x27;s very nice that I don&#x27;t need to use any shaving cream - just a razor and I&#x27;m ready to go. What is good also if I need to travel with it somewhere (I don&#x27;t need to carry a shaving cream)&lt;br /&gt;+ 2. The handle is comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;+ 3. I wasn&#x27;t afraid to cut myself. The moisture provides a great feeling of a safe shaving!&lt;br /&gt;- 4. I don&#x27;t think that the moisture is gonna last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: I would suggest to get it for your legs!</li>
    <li> This razor was provided to me via a program run by Gillette Venus. This razor is like most of the other venus razors. The cartridge fits on any venus handle but this handle was one of the more comfy handles. I like the smell but probably would not get it again because I like fresh scents over fruity scents. Overall Love this razor and the other venus razors.</li>
    <li> I finally tried this razor!I&#x27;ve seen it everywhere and heard awesome things about it. I really, really like it, i love the fact that its a 2-in-1 so you dont need to apply shaving cream or anything because it already has moisture bars and they work really well! When i saw it at first I&#x27;ll have to admit i thought it looked weird because I&#x27;ve never seen a razor like it before lol. I also like that you can easily replace the blades once they dont work anymore. When i used it, it left my skin feeling very smooth and it looked fantastic. The razor also smells really good! &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> This Venus razor with olay sugar berry scented cartridge is amazing! Not only does it smell great, it gives a super close shave.</li>
    <li> This razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Venus razor the very next day I received it and I really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Getting a close, silky and smooth shave is one of the most important things in my grooming routine, and I&#x27;ve never found anything so close to ideal better than the Venus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*No need of any shaving creams, soap or gel as it has attached little soap bars.&lt;br /&gt;*No razor burns, no cuts, just silky, fine and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;*Easy to handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*little sticky because of the bars attached, that is not much of a problem though.&lt;br /&gt;*Not moisturized enough so had to apply moisturizer right after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I liked this product.</li>
    <li> ok so not only do i love the fact that I can shave with out any shaving cream , I love the 5 blades on this razor I know I am getting a closer shave and I dont have to go over what I already did. another plus is that it is infused with OLAY!!!!!! I love products by Olay because of my extremely sensitive skin. I really recommend this product and now that summer is here....Ladies we need our legs to be silky smooth.</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing! the five blades really do make a difference and I noticed that their so much smoother!  After about one day of shaving with a three blade razor I become \\&quot;Prickely\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s now been three days and i&#x27;m still not \\&quot;prickely\\&quot;! I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I recently started using the Venus &amp; Olay razor in Sugarberry and I am absolutely in LOVE! I am always in a rush to get ready and when I don&#x27;t have to take the extra time to put on shaving cream it cuts my shower time in half!. I love that the moisture bars move as you glide over the different areas to get a close shave. My legs feel moisturized and so smooth! I will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> I say shaving is a drag but I don&#x27;t like having hairy legs either. The Venus &amp; Olay razor run by Gillette Venus made the job easier:). Love the smell of it also. The one thing I really loved is that I recieved for free and to recieved something this great and for free is unexplainable! I was actually scared to use it at first because a new razor alway leaves me cut well with this one , not one!, and it also left my skin when dry as if I applied lotion. What a plus to that! Well anyways this was a great product and I highly recommend it to every woman.</li>
    <li> The Bad: The smell was a little too strong for me, but then again I&#x27;m 6 months pregnant, so a lot of smells bother me at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;The Good:  The shave I got from this razor was amazing! It left my legs silky smooth and feeling fantastic.  I got this razor from Gillette on a promotion (thanks Gillette!) but I would definitely spend money on it, and I&#x27;d recommend others to do so!</li>
    <li> Recieved the new Venus &amp; Olay Razor via company run by Gillette Venus so I decided to give it a go. Few things first, I am an avid user of Gillette, my personal weapon of choice is Gilette Fusion and yes I am a female. Let&#x27;s talk about the Venus &amp; Olay packaging, it is easy to open you don&#x27;t need scissors or any teeth to get it open. But not Eco friendly. The minute you do reveal the razor you are hit in the face with sugar berry aroma. So kudos for them living up to their sugar berry name. However it is more so geared for preteens. I prefer essential oil scents of eucalyptus or lavender. It comes with one razor, one cartridge, and a shower hook which I do appreciate! Because most razors do not come with the same consideration. I usually use shave cream but given the hydrating moisture bars I didn&#x27;t need them. Stepping out of the shower I did feel moisturized and clean shaven. I do feel the moisture bars worked their magic in the shower. Slimey but good.I do appreciate the bars because I am more confident I won&#x27;t cut myself.  So I do recommend the product, it does live up to its name. However for something that is not considerably disposable,, the razor itself does remind me of something you would toss out after x amount of usage. It isn&#x27;t too inviting to replenish the blade. Overall, good product and good job collaborating with Olay. Oh, sugar berry does wash off. Not penetrating.</li>
    <li> When I was accepted into a program run by Gillette Venus to try the Venus &amp; Olay Razor I checked my mail everyday, I was that excited! First off the packaging was very cute! When I first opened the razor head there was a pleasant fragrance but once you start using the razor it went away. I shave my legs everyday, especially in the summer, but the moisture bars only lasted through 3 shaves. I loved the thought of not having to use shaving cream but with the head only lasting 3 shaves it wasn&#x27;t for me. I still had to use lotion after I shaved because I didn&#x27;t notice any extra moisture than usual. Also the razor isn&#x27;t practical for bikini area or under arms because the head is to bulky. All that being said it did give my legs a good close shave. I would recommend this for teens just starting to shave or people who don&#x27;t have much time to shave (new moms, ect.).</li>
    <li> I received the Venus and Olay Sugarberry razor from thte Gillette Venus program. This a really nice razor. It has a great scent. The shave wasn&#x27;t incredibly close, so I had to go over a couple of times but it got the job made my legs feel awesome.</li>
    <li> I was able to test the razor through a program run by Gillette Venus.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is cute, and eye catching.&lt;br /&gt;The smell was pleasant. I love the subtle lather that it razor head alone provides with water. It glided over my legs smoothly catching all of the hair. The blade were sharp enough for thick hair so I didn&#x27;t have any trouble.&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is how expensive this razor is. $8? I mean, I get it. It&#x27;s a great razor, and you get what you pay for but sheesh! For $8, I can buy a waxing kit that will take the hair from the root with much longer lasting results.</li>
    <li> I really did enjoy the Sugarberry scented Venus &amp; Olay 5 BLADE... Yeah you read it.. 5 BLADES... Razor! I recieved this razor from a program run by Gillette Venus. And to say I was excited is an understatement! I have shaved my legs a few times with this razor now and I&#x27;m in love, it also comes with a suction cup for the shower to hold your razor which is AMAZING. I did however find I still like to use a small amount of shave lotion with it just because my skin is really sensitive. The blades are amazing, the razor shaves really close leaving you ZERO razor burn/bumps! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this razor. So if you like a good close effortless shave, I would totally recommend the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay razor!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Venus and olay razor over all was a very good razor. It left my legs feeling moisturized and soft with an amazing feeling. The one thing about this product i didn&#x27;t like is how much soap is used for one shave experience, I feel this Razor could be a waist of money on the heads.</li>
    <li> The Venus &amp; Olay(tm) Razor was provided to me via a program run by Gillette Venus. I was really skeptical about it because of how small the moisture bars were. It has worked extremely well and has given me a close shave and left my skin feeling really smooth. The moisture bars don&#x27;t look any smaller than they did when I first received it. It also did not cause any problems for my sensitive skin. I would definitely purchase this razor it is really convenient to not need shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I received this wonderful Razor via Gillette Venus.&lt;br /&gt;The container was very simple to open and assembly was a snap...literally!&lt;br /&gt;First impression I got was the aroma witch I have to say I enjoyed the smell of sugarberry right off!&lt;br /&gt;It was really nice not having to mess with messy shaving gel and I got a really smooth shave out of this razor.&lt;br /&gt;My husband totally loves the look and feel of my legs after i shaved with this product!&lt;br /&gt;I would totally recommend this to anyone looking into it!</li>
    <li> I got my razor via a program run by Gillette Venus. I loved this razor. It was literally the closest shave I&#x27;ve got in a while on my legs and the Olay moisture bars were perfect. I always use shaving cream for moisture, but no need to with this razor. Saves time in the shower and smells great too!</li>
    <li> I recently tried my Venus &amp; Olay Razor for the first time; and while I usually can say nothing bad about either of these two companies, I have to honestly admit that my experience with this razor was disappointing. While the 5 blades of the razor worked wonderfully and left my legs and underarms with no stubble, the moisture bars alone made my experience less than pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this razor for the first time in the shower; shaving my legs first, I had no problem, and the razor glided slickly and quickly on my legs. However, once the razor and moisture bars were exposed to more than a few drops of water from the shower, the bars became a sticky mess. I proceeded to attempt to shave my underarms, but it was nearly impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Needless to say, both the razor and I didn&#x27;t come out from the experience unscathed. I had to wash the sticky residue off of my arms, and the razor had hair bits semi-permanently attached to  both moisture bars above and below the actual razor, and were even still stuck into the moisture bar after I had hung it outside of my shower with the given razor holder. Even when the razor was not exposed to water, the post-shower humidity made the bars begin to melt- and even froth a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a terrible razor- the razor itself is quite phenomenal and shaves without a problem. However, for somebody like myself who typically shaves in the shower, I do not highly advise this product. This razor would best be used post-shower- as I learned the hard way, too much water will turn the moisture pads into a gloppy mess. I am highly tempted to cut off both moisture bars from the razor, especially since there is a third, smaller moisture bar above the five blades already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay &amp;Venus has made some great products in the past- needless to say, this is not one of them. I would personally suggest removing one of the moisture bars or making them smaller- however, as is, the razor is unusable where many women shave; in the shower.the shower.</li>
    <li> I love the scent, and my legs are left silky smooth, but the Olay bars fall apart quickly and if they are left even a little bit too wet, you&#x27;ll be left with a puddle of slime and a plain ol boring razor.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this razor. The sugarberry scent is delicious. My legs were as smooth as possible after I shaved. I honestly do not have a bad word to say about this razor. I also think that the packaging is really cute and colorful. I received this razor from a program run by Gillette Venus.</li>
    <li> My razor was provided via a program run by Gillette Venus but I did enjoy the product. First impression was that the packaging was good, it didn&#x27;t take an army to remove the plastic.. Haha. Second, it smells soo good!! And then last but not least, great shave five blade and best of all no shaving cream! I even used it around the bikini area and no irritation thus far. Love.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve tried many razors in my lifetime and I had been met with the same heartbreak - the rash, the bumps, the dry skin until I got this razor from a program run by Gillette. I&#x27;ve only had the razor for about a week but I have not had any razor burn or irritation. Surrounding the razor are two moisturizing bars - my legs don&#x27;t feel as dry as they used to. But I had a bit of difficulty getting the hair around my knees with the bars in the way - without putting too much pressure on the razor. There&#x27;s 5 razors, so it&#x27;s unlikely that you&#x27;ll miss patches of hair. (I&#x27;m lazy, so that happened pretty often.) Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this razor.</li>
    <li> I got the opportunity to use the Venus &amp; Olay Razor in Sugarberry through a program run by Gillette Venus. The first thing I noticed when I just opened the packaging was that it smells delicious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin, which means my skin usually stings after I finish shaving. The Olay Moisture Bars soothed my skin, keeping the stinging to a minimum. I didn&#x27;t realize at first that the Olay Moisture Bars meant I didn&#x27;t have to use shaving cream. Once I figured it out, it cut down my shaving time without adversely affecting the shaving experience at all. Plus, I felt that the razor did a good job of catching all the tiny little hairs that might have been missed or gone unnoticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars rather than 5 because 1) the packaging was little difficult to open and hurt my fingers, and 2) the Olay Moisture Bars kept getting into my nails when I tried to steady the razor head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it was a positive experience that I would repeat and recommend to others!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this razor. I&#x27;m in love with the sugarberry scent. It glides very smoothly, as all razors should. The great part about it, is that it moisturizes my skin, making it impossible to not touch my legs!</li>
    <li> This razor provided a very nice shaving experience!  The scent was pleasant and fruity, and with five blades it gave me a very close shave.  The two moisture bars made it easy to glide on my legs without nicking, and my legs felt very soft afterwards! The bars do widen the razor a bit, so this product is best for legs and larger areas- I wouldn&#x27;t use it for my bikini line.  The only drawback is that without shaving cream it&#x27;s difficult to see where you have already shaved. I was provided this razor via a program run by Gillette Venus.</li>
    <li> My overall shave experience with this particular Venus &amp; Olay razor in Sugar berry provided by Gillette Venus, it is not less than fantastic, I am having my b est shave ever, the cartridges works just so smooth and with excellent precision, the smell is awesome, and it has longer lasting then other ones I tried before. I certainly recommend this product to my family and friend,</li>
    <li> The razor was provided by a program run by Gillette Venus and let me tell you something about it. . .it is wonderful! It is so easy to use and saves soooo much time while shaving time! Before you get this product you should know that it is very convenient! It comes with a cute razor holder that can be put in the shower to hold it. The first time i used it ,it left my legs very smooth! and the smell was amazing! I would definitely recommend this product to any one who wants to save time,and have baby smooth legs.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. The razor was provided via a program run by Gillette Venus.&lt;br /&gt;I love the moisture bar, that allows me to not use shaving cream. Cutting down cost is always a bonus. i also like the grip that helped avoid cuts.</li>
    <li> I was provided a Venus &amp; Olay(tm) Razor by a program run by Gillette Venus to try this product and see what my thoughts were. I&#x27;ve purchased this same Venus &amp; Olay razor in the regular Olay scent as well. I love the Sugarberry scent a lot more than the regular one. I also love the fact that the Sugarberry scented razor is pink instead of the regular scented one which is yellow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the performance of the razor - it&#x27;s awesome! I&#x27;ve had good luck with 5 bladed razors and this one is just as great. It&#x27;s actually even better because the 2 Olay moisture bars on either side of the blades are really gentle on my skin. I didn&#x27;t use any shaving cream and I wasn&#x27;t victim to any red bumps or razor nicks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisture bars lasted me quite a few shaving sessions as well. A lot more than I would have expected since they&#x27;re pretty small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little tip: don&#x27;t shave your legs directly under the water from your shower head. This will &amp;#34;eat up&amp;#34; the 2 moisture bars prematurely!! Those little Olay bars are your legs best friends :)</li>
    <li> I recently got a chance to try out the Venus &amp; Olay razor in sugarberry as part of a program run by GilletteVenus, and ladies let me tell ya how awesome it actually was! I usually prefer shaving with men&#x27;s razors because I feel it&#x27;s a much closer shave and I was pleasantly surprised by this razor and how close a shave I was able to get! I loved the sugarberry scent (scented anything, really) and loved the fact that it came with a shower hook (no more dropping my razor, hooray!), I thought that was a very nice touch. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this razor!! It left my skin so incredibly smooth, but it was still the same Venus I am used too! It wasn&#x27;t clunky like other razors that have a bar built in, it was just the same slim line razor. Plus, this razor handle has an extra grip effect that was awesome!!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00AFCOWB6 Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Sugarberry Scent Razor 1 Kit]]Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Sugarberry Scent Razor is a great product! I love the scent, and no I am not a teenager. It&#x27;s pleasant, and does not linger so you don&#x27;t actually step out of the shower smelling like it. I did not have a single snag, no nicks, and was able to shave my legs, underarms, and bikini area effortlessly. In fact, I kept checking to make sure it was actually shaving because it just felt so smooth! I love the suction holder it comes with, it has not fallen off once. I tried this razor through a program run by Gillette Venus, and I am completely in love with it and will definitely be buying the refills. I don&#x27;t ever use soap or shave cream because I&#x27;m too lazy, and consequently always suffer from nicks, ingrown hairs and severely dry legs. I&#x27;m so happy this razor addresses all of my issues. I&#x27;ve tried similar products in the past, but have found them to be too large and cumbersome. I was even able to shave my knees with no worry at all.</li>
    <li> I  received this razor from a Gillette  Venus  program the other day  and immediately opened it. the  packaging by the way  was  much easier to open than many other brands I&#x27;ve used.The sugarberry  scent is amazing, I  love fruity  smells  and this one is no exception.  I&#x27;ve never used a razor that had more than three  or four blades  and this one has  five so I was  curious as to whether or not the fifth blade would make a difference  but boy was I wrong. I&#x27;ve never had a  closer shave. one of my favorite things about this though is the moisturizing  bars on the razor  these asking with the five blades made my skin so unbelievably smooth and soft! no ugly red bumps,  no irritation,  just soft and smooth skin. I  highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a campaign that Gillete was running and let me just say, I loved this razor! I usually just use the venus razor but this new one made my legs so smooth! Only down side to it was that the bar did get very slimy. It came with a newly designed shower hook though that made it okay to deal with. Overall this is a great product and i will be purchasing extra cartridge heads!</li>
    <li> Cool packaging! Nice gift for a student just off to college, or any young woman that likes something with a little sparkle. Nice close shave, and great non slip grip handle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wondered how well the Venus &amp; Olay Razor worked, so when Gilette Venus sent me a sample, I was looking forward to try it out. And wow, what a pleasure it was to use! Once the Olay bars got lathered up, the razor just glided on my legs. It didn&#x27;t even feel like I was shaving. My legs felt smooth and moisturized, even the knobby knee and ankle areas, which usually gets razor burns. It was also awesome how I didn&#x27;t have to lather up beforehand, which saved me time in the shower. My only concern was how quickly the moisture bars seemed to dissolve in the water. When I was rinsing out the blades, I noticed that I was also inadvertently rinsing out the moisture bars, which I felt was a waste. Overall, I find it a great product, and I would certainly consider purchasing it after I use mine up.</li>
    <li> Before I was sent this promotion from Gillette Venus I hadn&#x27;t considered purchasing this product. I figured that I could just use my husband&#x27;s razor. Now that I&#x27;ve tried it I wouldn&#x27;t go back. I didn&#x27;t have to use any shave gel/cream and my legs were silky soft and remained non-irritated for several days! I am very impressed and will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> First off I want to say I tried this product via a program that was run by Gillette Venus. And I must say that this razor is amazing. My legs have never felt so smooth ever. I usually have to use lotion after I get out the shower from shaving and with this product they were already super moisturized and I didn&#x27;t need any. I also love how it has five blades so you don&#x27;t have to keep irritating the skin by keep going over it. It also lasted all day the next day too, my legs were silky smooth!! I would definitely have to give this product and five star review! If you don&#x27;t own it, you should!!</li>
    <li> I recently got to try this product for free from a program ran by Gillette Venus. I really liked the product in a lot of ways. 1.) Your legs are left silky and really soft. 2.) It&#x27;s really easy to use the razor, it glides across your skin even in the most sensitive areas. 3.) I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of shaving cream so being able to shave with the moisture bars made it easier and safer to shave and saved me a lot of time.&lt;br /&gt;Flaws: 1.) The moisture bars didn&#x27;t seem to last very long. I have a feeling that I would have to buy replacements more often.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I really loved the product, I definitely recommend it if you are looking for easy silky, smooth legs!</li>
    <li> Im not to pleased with this product. I got to try it by a program ran by Gillette. It does not shave very good and leaves a slimy film on my legs. I would not suggest this to friends or family waste of money a 2 blade razer works better then this one.</li>
    <li> I got the Gillette Venus and okay razor through a campaign ran by Gillette. At first I was a little skeptical about whether or not I would like this razor because its hard to find a good razor, but I must say I was quite impressed with the job it did. The sugar berry scent smells amazing. The razor gets a smooth, close shave and leaves your legs feeling moisturized. I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone!</li>
    <li> I got this razor about a week ago through a program run by Gillette Venus. Immediately I loved the packaging and how you can just attach it to your shower wall. The shaving experience had it&#x27;s pros and cons. I liked the sugarberry smell and how close the shave was. However, I didn&#x27;t like how I wasn&#x27;t able to see where I was shaving because of the moisture bars, so I had to go back over some spots when I was done. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m a shaving cream fiend so it&#x27;s more cost effective to me that I don&#x27;t need it with this razor, I just like to see where I&#x27;m shaving. I also didn&#x27;t like how the moisture bars left a slimy feeling on my legs. Overall, I would recommend it to someone who doesn&#x27;t like to spend too much time shaving. It has a very close shave and it&#x27;s great that you don&#x27;t have to use your own shaving cream, but it&#x27;s not what I prefer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of this razor at all. The Olay part of the razor melts so fast, I mean I was able to shave my legs about 3 times before I had to go buy new razor blades BUT it does leave a nice close shave. The only good points are that it comes with a suction cupped holder so you can keep it up right in the shower.</li>
    <li> i absoulte love this razor it is amazing it left my legs so smooth i couldnt tell that i had shaved no razors bumps or anything and it left an amazing scent</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get my razor in the mail through a program run by Gillette Venus. Gillette Venus and Olay have been two great companies with wonderful products. I couldn&#x27;t wait to see what the product had in store for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is my pros and cons list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros -&lt;br /&gt;1. No shaving cream!&lt;br /&gt;2. Unbelievably smooth legs&lt;br /&gt;3. Delicious Sugarberry scent&lt;br /&gt;4. Will shave right over my scabs and not reopen them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt;1. The Olay moisture bars are too plump so I feel like the razor is not getting my skin as close as it should.&lt;br /&gt;2. The moisture bars make it difficult to transport razor if I am going somewhere for the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;3. Always getting more moisturizer even if I don&#x27;t need/want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great shave and a great razor!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome razor. It was very moisturizing and it makes the shaving task a lot easier and quicker. My legs are very smooth when I get out of the shower. What I don&#x27;t like about the Olay on the razor is when you are getting down to the end, it falls off. But all in all, I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I received this razor via a program run by Gillette Venus. I really liked the smell of it and was disappointed that the smell disappeared after I rinsed my legs however it did leave my legs nice and smooth without the use of shaving cream. I also used this under my arms and again I didn&#x27;t receive any nicks or scraps and they were smooth. I did not get any razor bumps with the use of this razor. I did notice that the olay soap that is around the razor dissolves before the razor is to dull to use. I used the razor the first two time without shaving cream but by the third time the soap was almost gone so I used shaving cream so I wouldn&#x27;t scrap my legs the razor is still sharp and shaves very well. The suction cup that comes with the razor is very nice so I do not have to lay the razor on the side of the tub.  I do recommend this razor to others.</li>
    <li> First off, I would like to say I got to try this for free through a Gillette Venus program, thank you Gillette (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay I personally like this product because:&lt;br /&gt;1. Saves water use&lt;br /&gt;2. It smells great&lt;br /&gt;3. Leaves your skin feeling desirably soft&lt;br /&gt;4. Super quick shaving time&lt;br /&gt;5. No need for shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my skin is pretty sensitive and prone to razor bumps but I had no problems using this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now there is a couple things that are not that great about this razor. First off is the moisturizing soap, once it is all used up you better hope you have shaving cream on hand. The other thing is the price.. Not really a fan of it. But if you don&#x27;t shave all that often then I guess you&#x27;ll be pretty happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this product! This razor was provided for me from a program by Gillete Venus and I&#x27;m glad I got the chance to try it out. I&#x27;ve used plenty of other Venus razors, but none were like this! At first I thought this would just be like a plain old razor, nothing special, but I was wrong! I got the closest shave that I&#x27;ve ever had from a razor! The only downfall I see is that the moisture bars on my razor ran out at different times. The bottom one ran out before the top so it didn&#x27;t glide as easily over my legs after a few uses. But i solved that problem with shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product and I will have to repurchase it!</li>
    <li> I loved this razor at first but i hung it up with the suction cup attachment and it fell into my tub and the soap on the top of the razor was all disintegrated before i realized it. After the soap is gone, its a mediocre razor.</li>
    <li> Its hard to get use to the sides but I really lie th built in soap! I hope for more deals in th future</li>
    <li> Gives me a close shave every time!!!</li>
    <li> I am choosing one star to protest blatant deceit by this manufacturer.  The package says boldly, &amp;#34;Five blades,&amp;#34; which is intended to cause a buyer to believe at a glance that the package contains the handle and five blades.  Shame on the company for intentionally misleading customers.  One blade with five blade layers is not the same and the manufacturer knew it.  Where did pride in product and honesty in advertising go?  If your razor is good, you should not have to deceive to sell it.</li>
    <li> it it great for my legs it works great smells great and keeps my legs feeling moisturized all day long</li>
    <li> This razor is seriously awesome.  There are few razors that I actually like, and this is definitely at the top of my list.  The olay moisturizers actually work and my legs feel soft and smooth after shaving.  The razor gives a close shave, no razor burn or cutting.  I don&#x27;t actually like any of the other venus razors, but this new one does amazing things.  The only downside is the price, this is very pricey for my tastes, but if I want to pamper myself its worth it.  I would say I got about 5 full leg shaves with some in between underarm shaves before the olay strips dissolved and I didn&#x27;t want to use the cartridge anymore.  All in all, even a cheapskate like myself will buy these fancy razors again, worth it!</li>
    <li> These are great razors and they smell REALLY a good.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this out for FREE from Gillette and I am so happy I did! I didn&#x27;t have to use any shaving cream and it made my legs super silk for two or three days after! I can&#x27;t wait to buy these!</li>
    <li> Okay, so I was so excited when I  receive my Venus &amp; Olay razor in my mail box. I normally use disposable razors from store. I don&#x27;t have a specific brand or razor I absolutely love or use all the time. When this razor came I tried it out almost emediently. The one thing I noticed first was the color was bright yellow. When I opened the package it smelled good. Its a nice vanilla scent I enjoyed. I also liked that it came with a hanging thing to hang the razor in the shower, I thought that was smart. I noticed the Olay bar on the razor, which is nice because you don&#x27;t have to use as much shaving cream. There was is nice grip to the razor. So it does not slip. I really like this razor and will be purchasing another cartridge. I will recommending this razor to family and friends. Thank you Venus &amp; Olay for the great product!</li>
    <li> Not worth the price. It was an add on and the price should have been greatly discounted....it was not!</li>
    <li> I got this in a Venus &amp; Olay gift pack that came with lotion and soap, and I have to say the razor is TERRIBLE. It does not give a close shave AT ALL. Did I just get a faulty razor or what? Also it nicked me like 10 times.. The soap literally disintegrated after 1 use. What the hell? My dollar store s***ty razors are better than this expensive crap. I really don&#x27;t see how this has so many \\&quot;great\\&quot; reviews, it&#x27;s horrible, or at least mine was.. *sigh* And I thought I had a great razor :( Oh well..</li>
    <li> A few weeks ago I was selected for a Bzz Agent Campaign for the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Razor. I received a free Gillette Venus &amp; Olay razor from Gillette as part of this campaign.  I was supposed to try it out with my tween and report back my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I handed over the Venus &amp; Olay razor to my tween to try shaving (which, quite frankly, she doesn&#x27;t need, she only turned 11 a few weeks ago, I thought I would give it a shot.  Besides, it would give me a good opportunity to talk to my daughter about shaving, even if she doesn&#x27;t need to yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, I like things simple. I&#x27;ve never liked women&#x27;s razors for a variety of reasons.  Remember when they had big fat handles that were difficult to hold?  At one time or another, I have tried all the latest and greatest women&#x27;s razors, only to return to men&#x27;s razors for their simplicity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I can&#x27;t believe the size of the moisture bars on the razor. Holy cow, it makes the razor head HUGE! This poses a huge problem: there is absolutely no effective and easy way to shave the problem areas of the legs like the ankle and knee caps. The moisture bars also make it harder to tell where the razor has already been because it shows a wider swath than what was actually shaved, meaning an uneven, stripey shave if you&#x27;re not careful.  I also thought the shave wasn&#x27;t that close, as if the moisture bars were too elevated to let the razors actually touch the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s not forget the armpits. There was no way to shave the armpits with the large razor head.  More like impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I call this an over-engineered piece of junk!</li>
    <li> I received free Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Razor from BzzAgent. I normally buy a cheaper pack of disposal razors. But I tried to choose 5 blades. Since I got this razor I was excited to try it. Guess what...I love it. Olay moisture bars on each sides on it so I don&#x27;t have to use a shaving gel anymore. Smooth shave and easy to use. I  have a daughter begging to wants to shave years. I think this is the one she needs.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Sugarberry Scent Womans Razor free from Gillette &amp; I do like how the Olay left my legs smooth &amp; I didn&#x27;t have to use shaving cream but that is about all I like about this razor.&lt;br /&gt;Even tho it has 5 blades it did not get a close shave, isn&#x27;t that the purpose of a razor? Forget about shaving under your arms, with how big the razor head it, it is impossible!&lt;br /&gt;Would I go out and buy this razor? No and I cannot reccomend it to others either. Sorry....</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from Gillette from a BzzAgent program. I also had one before I got a free one. The scent is really nice. I love this razor and now I have one for my daughter, as well. I like not having to use shaving cream. The moisture bar provides the lubrication I need to shave my legs. If you are looking for that moisturized feel you get after using shaving cream, no I don&#x27;t think it is the same. I rarely use anything other than soap, and this is definitely better. I also found that I got a close shave on my legs and underarms. I will continue buying the refills.</li>
    <li> For a girl that only needs to shave once a week or so, this razor just will not do! After managing to escape razor burn (although it felt like I was creating massive damage) only two days later and I am a hairy beast again. The two moisture &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; as I am calling them do nothing but leave snail trails of disgustingness all over your legs. I dare not attempt to venture to the lady bits...a bikini line is far too much for this piece of craftsmanship to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big disappointment Venus...</li>
    <li> This razor is definitely one of a kind. The first time I used it, it felt \\&quot;different\\&quot; compared to my usual razor. However, the results were fantastic! The shave was very close and my skin was so soft afterwards. I am now completely used to it and I love it. I will definitely be buying more of these in the near future. Better than anything I&#x27;ve used yet. Love it!!</li>
    <li> First let me say that I received the Venus Olay razor free to review(as a BzzAgent), but I was so impressed that I decided to write a review on Amazon. I gave the razor to my daughter to use for her first time shaving (she&#x27;s 11) and I loved the close, smooth shave along with the moisture that the Olay added. She did not need to use any lotions or creams after shaving because of the moisture that the Olay added.</li>
    <li> We used the Venus &amp; Olay Razor we got #Free from #Gillette for my 12 year old daughter&#x27;s first shave.  She was so excited about it, and I was a little less worried because the razor has such big lubrication bars, and was easy for her to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It went well, with no knicks or cuts, and that made for a happy daughter and a happy mom :)  The razor came in pink (perfect for a 12 year old girls first shave) and smelled like SUGARBERRY HEAVEN!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will definitely be purchasing a Venus &amp; Olay Razor next time we need to get her one!!</li>
    <li> Works great, no shaving rash after. I would recommend for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette as part of a Bzz agent campaign for my opinion.  The minute this was opened, your could smell the delicious scent of Sugarberry and my 13 year old granddaughter asked if this could be her first razor. She came out of the shower later and said it was so smooth and she didn&#x27;t cut herself or use shaving cream or soap. It just glided she said!</li>
    <li> The soap around didint even last two days before it fell off</li>
    <li> I love this product. And I love Gillette for providing me with it for free. Leaves my skin silky smooth in one stroke. I love how it&#x27;s unnecessary to use shaving cream. Just a little water and go. I will definitely introduce this product to my 13 year old daughter. I&#x27;m thinking she&#x27;ll like it. Only downfall is that it is difficult to shave bikini area due to size.</li>
    <li> I was excited for my girls to try the Venus for free (thanks Gillette!) since they&#x27;ve only previously used the less expensive disposable brands (I&#x27;ve admittedly tried to save money, since they go through razors ridiculously fast). The report is that the feel of the Venus in their hand is MUCH preferred over the smaller, lighter varieties, and the smooth (no cream needed) strip is great! The one thing, however, that will take them some getting used to is that because the strip is so smooth (and leaves a film), it&#x27;s hard to tell whether they&#x27;ve gotten close enough to their skin. (My daughter reported having to press down harder than she would with a less substantial razor head.) This will take some getting used to, but I&#x27;m hoping that in the long run, the Venus will be a better investment! (And, I can feel good that the razor design makes it virtually impossible for them to nick themselves, even without shaving cream!)</li>
    <li> Loved this razor! I got a super close shave without any cuts thanks to a great handle with awesome grip. The awesome smelling moisture bars kept my legs smooth and moisturized after the shave. I got this free to try from Gillette and will definitely be buying again and again. :-)</li>
    <li> Love this razor.  The Olay Sugarberry scent smells wonderful and does a much better job than the razors I had been using.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both tried this new razor as a free sample from Gillette.  I was happy with the built in moisturizer bars, they left my legs smooth and hydrated, however, they don&#x27;t last very long.  We used it a total of 7 times for shaving before it ran out.  I usually use a razor more times than that so as far as money is concerned, paying more for the moisture bars wasn&#x27;t worthwhile to me.  The closeness of the shave is the same as any other 5 blade razor.  My daughter has been shaving for a short time.  She loved the moisture bars and the scent, but personally prefers a non-swivel razor for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;No real complaints, but nothing special for me.  I may by refills if I have a coupon, but it is a bit too pricey for the novelty to not last any longer than that.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  The scent is pleasant and not too sweet and I love how smooth it glides over the skin.</li>
    <li> Loved this Razor. My legs are softer smoother after shaving. I am glad that I am a BuzzAgent because I got to try it for free. Try this Venus Razor and you will keep using it</li>
    <li> As a mom of a 13 year girl, anyone that has a teen daughter knows , for your daughter to use a product it has to be trendy and catch her attention. I gave this to her to try ( she&#x27;s been shaving already a year now). She immediately came out of the bathroom saying &amp;#34;mom! Feel my legs, that razor made my legs, sooo smooth.&amp;#34; As a mom I like the moisture bars, because with the Venus there is less of a chance she will cut herself, as well as the practicality of not having to buy additional shaving products, body wash, shaving cream, etc. I would recommend this product to moms, a daughters alike!</li>
    <li> Apparently you&#x27;re paying more for less and the Olay name. The razors work fine, but other kinds come with more cartridges for less money. It smells good, I&#x27;ll give it that. Didn&#x27;t cut myself either, but my wallet is not pleased with my failure to read carefully at quantity.</li>
    <li> This razor was great. Its very different but was pleasantly surprised at how well this actually works. left skin feeling soft and smooth. very easy to use. will definitely use again.</li>
    <li> I was sent the GILLETTE® VENUS Oil of Olay to try and I was skeptical. I usually use a Gillette razor built for a man simply because I have never had a good experience with a woman&#x27;s razor. The razor never got close enough or it doesn&#x27;t contour the curve of the leg (knees esp.). I have to say I was highly impressed with the GILLETTE® VENUS. It has the most amazing feel after I shave my legs.  The moisturizing strips are amazing.  This razor is so good that it doesn&#x27;t require that you use soap or shaving gel to shave.  This is such a great razor esp for beginners.  No razor burn and no Nicks.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this razor works as well as it could. I would like it to be a closer shave and it doesn&#x27;t seem to get that close of a shave.</li>
    <li> I love this razor how smooth it leaves your legs is great.</li>
    <li> I received this free from BzzAgent to try out and leave a review on so hear is my review! I just love not having to use any shaving cream while using this razor! And it leaves your skin feeling sooo soft and the scent is amazing! This is going to be my go to razor instead of the cheapo&#x27;s that I am usually buying. Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I really like this razor for a number of reasons.  First off, the razor leaves my skin feeling like soft butter.  The moisturizing bars did wonders for my skin.  The razor gave me the perfect shave.  The moisturizing bars have a wonderful smell.  Thanks Gillette for letting me try these for free as I will be buying these from now on for both myself and my daughter.</li>
    <li> got this great razor free from Gillette.  Smooth shave without the added messy step of shaving cream. The Olay strips provide everything you need, no shaving cream required at all. No nicks whatsoever which is a big plus for me!</li>
    <li> I received a FREE coupon to try the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Razor and I absolutely LOVE the clean, cloase shave I get with this razor! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice, inexpensive razor.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t care for this razor at all! Yes my legs did have a silky feeling after wards but I can also buy shaving gel with moisture if I needed to. The Olay moisture bars were a bit too thick and I felt like I had to press a little harder to get a good, close shave which of course would lead to nicks. Then the moisture bars themselves would get slimy. I mean actual trails of slime were coming off the bars...gross. I&#x27;m definitely going back to my old razor brand.</li>
    <li> I received a sample razor from Gillette . I really liked it. Left my legs feel real soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This razor first of all smells AMAZING!! I love the fact that I do not have to use any shave gel when I use this razor. The moisture bars make the razor glide smoothly over my legs and I only have to pass over a spot one time in order to remove all hair and stubble. It left my skin moisturized even after I was done shaving. I have had no problems with ingrown hairs or razor bumps since I made the switch to this awesome razor. I have always been a fan of the Gillette Venus line of razors but thie Olay &amp; Sugarberry is by far my most favorite of all of them. This is a great razor for anyone that wants a clean, close shave. Thank you so much Gillette for letting me try this great razor for FREE!!!!</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette for free to review on Bzzagent.  I absolutely love this razor, and have to say it is the best I&#x27;ve used since beginning to shave my legs 24 years ago.  I get a real great shave with it, and have not cut my legs once since beginning to use it 6 weeks ago.  The only things I&#x27;m not fond of is the cost of the refill packs, and today upon using a refill pack for the first time, one of the moisturizer bars fell off half way done with shaving.  Too expensive to have this happen.</li>
    <li> First let me say that the scent of this razor is amazing and relaxing !! The Olay moisturizing bars are perfect for a super smooth, cut free shave. My legs were so soft and smooth, there was no need for lotion after my shower. The suction cup that came with the razor was an added bonus, if you leave the razor laying on the tub, the Olay moisture bars get all gooey. The razor suction holder isn&#x27;t as sturdy as I would like it to be, the razor doesn&#x27;t seem to stay put, I would say this is because of the thickness of the Olay moisturizing bars. All in all, it is a pretty sturdy razor, what makes it even better is that I got it absolutely free from Gillette®, along with a $5.00 coupon. Thank God for the coupon because razors are pretty pricy.</li>
    <li> I got this razor free from Gillette to try out.  It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve bought a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; razor with all the bells and whistles.  I&#x27;ve been using generic 3-blade razors with a moisturizing strip.  It does the job, but I HATE shaving, so I don&#x27;t do it very often.  I prefer to wax my legs, but it takes forever and the beauty shop where I buy refills is far away from my house.  So I usually have pretty long leg hair.  Which means that when I do shave, I clog the razor and it takes forever to shave...and it makes me hate shaving even more.  This morning, I decided to try shaving with my new Venus razor.  I lathered up...and then realized that I don&#x27;t have to use soap or shaving cream or anything because it&#x27;s BUILT RIGHT IN!!  It took me a few passes to realize that the blades weren&#x27;t getting clogged with leg hair.  The shave was so smooth that I really didn&#x27;t even think that it was shaving the hair off.  I got to my knees and it didn&#x27;t nick my knobby knees.  No cuts!  I am sold on paying more for a better razor.  This would be a five star rating, but there is still hair on my knees (a problem that I have dealt with since I was an adolescent).</li>
    <li> I was very excited when my Venus &amp; Olay razor sample came earlier than anticipated. I used it right away, I was a little unsure of the Olay lotion on the top and bottom of the razor, but it seemed to work out okay. Although it was kind of slimey once it got wet.I was not very happy though the next day when my legs felt stubbly again. I was disappointed. I wanted to give it another shot, so shaved again with it and not one day but two days later have stubble again. My normal razor can get me through 3 days of no problems with smooth legs. I did see it in the store and the price was normal versus the other razors I have used in the past. All in all not really all that impressed with it. Unless I had a good coupon I would not go out of my way to purchase it.</li>
    <li> love it!!!thank you Gillette for supplying me and my daughter this awesome razor that gave us close moisturized shave with a wonderful scent!! no knicks and glided real smoothly  would recommend to anyone...</li>
    <li> We received a free sample of this product courtesy of Gillette so that we can try and review it.  My daughter and I tried this product for her first time shave and she loved it! She found this very easy to grip and manipulate without cutting herself in any way. I highly recommend this product to all the Ladies &amp; Teens!!</li>
    <li> Love the color and it has an easy grip handle but the shave is lacking closeness. I went over my legs twice and still wasn&#x27;t happy with the results :( I also left the razor in the shower over night, forgot to cover, the next afternoon it was a glob of mess! The softening strips on both sides had turned into a glue consistency and had fallen off. I won&#x27;t be buying refills. I did receive this product free from Buzzagent</li>
    <li> Love love love this razor.  It provides a very close shave and leaves my skin feeling so soft with no razor burn or nicks.  My daughter used this razor as well and she liked it just as much as I did.  I will be buying the refills for this razor and this will be my razor of choice from now on.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay razor free from Gillette for testing purposes. I am not picky about what I use to shave my legs - usually whatever disposables are on sale at the store, or sometimes my husband&#x27;s razor. I usually just use some conditioner to shave with. I was interested in trying out this razor primarily because of the moisture bars, as it seemed like you could just use the razor without having to mess around with shaving creams or lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this razor when I was leaving for a beach weekend as I wanted to be silky and smooth. The grips on the handle made it convenient to hold and not slippery, and the five blades made for a smooth enough shave. I didn&#x27;t cut myself at all, which was great (a common issue with disposable razors). However, the large head of the razor (due to the moisture bars) made it really difficult to go around curves, leaving quite a few missed hairs around my ankles, knees, and armpits. Still, I was overall pretty satisfied with the smoothness of the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real issue emerged shortly after I shaved. I was left with some serious razor burn and a large number of in-grown hairs, which almost never happens to me. It didn&#x27;t make for smooth, beautiful skin, that&#x27;s for sure. Next time, I wouldn&#x27;t trust the moisture bars on their own and would definitely recommend using some kind of shaving cream or lotion (or even conditioner) if you&#x27;re going to use it. That really cuts down on the convenience factor, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Venus Olay Razors are so terrific! I always get a clean nick free shave when I use them. :)</li>
    <li> My daughter came out of the bathroom and said mom I&#x27;m in love my legs are in heaven I tried it and I&#x27;m the same way it&#x27;s the best razor I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
    <li> Love Gillette Venus and Olay razor! Never received a knick from it, has a great grip handle, pivoting head, pretty color, very smooth on skin because of Olay strips! My daughter and I simply love it!!</li>
    <li> I received the product for free from Gillette and let me tell you how amazing it is I love it!  Not only does it get the job done the first time it also leaves your legs feeling soft and smooth, You get a nice shave and no stubble. I love that it has the Sugarberry scent and smells really good. Its glides on smooth and soft and I love that you don&#x27;t need shaving cream to actually shave because it has the Olay Sugarberry around the razor blade to give you that nice smooth feeling and fantastic smell! It has 5 blades, it has a nice soft grip to hold when shaving and it comes with a thing to hold your razor that you can stick on the wall to hang up when not using it! My legs dont feel dry or rough after using this razor its makes them feel silky smooth and the Olay soap makes me less dry! I love this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Firstly i must disclose I recieved this product for free from Gillette for testing purposes. My teens and i really liked the shaver. Knees are an issue as far as a good shave goes. It did well other than the knees. I loved the olay bars on the top and bottom. I never noticed any scent. I didn&#x27;t use shaving cream with it. Which is a huge plus. All and all i enjoyed the shaver.</li>
    <li> Love the silky smoothness after shaving. The handle makes it easier to grip...I&#x27;m not dropping the razor like I would with a disposable. The shave is close and feels great. Excellent beginner razor as well. My daughter was able to use hers without getting cuts or nicks.</li>
    <li> This razor is not good for armpit hair removal at all but probably for leg. Do not try it for armpit hair removal. It does not work at all. The high rating is misleading the potential customers.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I recently had the opportunity to try the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Razor in Sugarberry scent for free from BZZAGENT. We both loved the fact that there was no need for shaving cream, as the razor has it built right in around the blade. The Razor has 5 blades, and I would challenge you to find a closer shave anywhere! An additional \\&quot;Wow factor\\&quot; to me was the safety grip handle...a must for Mom&#x27;s with daughters just beginning to shave. The fact of most importance to my Daughter was that she was left with wonderfully smooth skin!</li>
    <li> This razor does not work well at all the added buffers are an inconvenience they hinder not help. This was a waist of money.</li>
    <li> I received a razor as a Buzz Agent and it is now my razor of choice. I have been using same blade for 4 weeks now shaving every other day and it still has plenty of moisturizer left. I have very dry skin and it leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Venus &amp; Olay Razor and was really happy with the results. I usually use a disposable razor that has three razor bars and it takes me a long time to shave. I noticed that the 5 razors really makes a difference and cuts down on the shaving time. I like the Olay Moisture bar because it helps to get a more smoother shave and not have to worry about it snagging on your skin. I love the Sugarberry scent. It&#x27;s a nice refreshing scent to smell while I&#x27;m pampering myself. My whole body is nice and smooth when I used the Venus &amp; Olay Razor. I received this free Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Sugarberry Razor from Gillete to test the product out.</li>
    <li> We were excited to try the new Venus razor. We went out and bought a separate razor for my mom. The first time I was a little worried about not using shaving cream but it was a very smooth shave because of the 5 blades and the moisture bars. I was very happy with the smoothness after I was done made my skin very soft and didn&#x27;t dry my legs we will be buying refills and using Venus from now on.</li>
    <li> My 11 year old was happy to try this razor. The Venus razor didn&#x27;t cut her legs. Other razor that she tried took off a strip of her skin. So I have been shaving her legs and she was not happy about that. I let her use this razor and the hair was gone and no razor burn and she kept her skin. Her skin was soft and not dry. I think the razor is safe to use for preteens. I received the product for free from Gillette®.</li>
    <li> My daughter received this razor as part of a #bzzagent campaign. We #gotitfree. She really likes it and she says it smells really good, especially while she&#x27;s shaving. The only thing she said she don&#x27;t like is the handle can get a little slippery.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome razor. A must have for every teenage girl. The fragrance was nice and pleasant.</li>
    <li> Love Gillette Venus &amp; Olay, leave my skin very soft and gently to the contact with a silky sensation.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to be able to try these. I received them for free from Gillette to test out. I loved the idea of not having to use a shaving cream. The handle is lightweight and easy to hold. It seems to be contoured in all the right places. I also like that the blades are not wrapped with metal wires like many women&#x27;s razors are. That is pretty much all I can say in a positive light about this product. While the razor worked okay on my legs, it performed terribly around my knees and my underarms. I think the problem is the moisturizing bars. They make the razor too wide to get in hard-to-reach areas, leaving large areas of unshaven skin under my arms. I continued to use this razor to shave my legs even though my legs didn&#x27;t seem to stay as smooth as with my normal razor. I think I got 5 shaves out of this blade before the moisturizing bars no longer worked. There was still moisturizer left, but it didn&#x27;t touch my skin so it was completely useless. Five okay shaves for the price of these blades in my opinion is unacceptable.</li>
    <li> I recently received this product for free as part of a BuzzAgent Campaign. I had used Venus razors before and been impressed, so my expectations were high. Once I received this razor, my expectations were exceeded. When I opened the package, I was surprised by what a pleasant scent (sugarberry) the razor had. I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily buy a razor just for the scent, but it&#x27;s an added feature that I appreciated. The most important thing, though, is the shave that you get from a razor. This razor delivers a close, comfortable shave that leaves my legs feeling silky smooth for days. I also feel like it was very moisturizing, so my legs didn&#x27;t feel dry and itchy like they sometimes do. Plus, the cartridges last for a long time. I will purchase the replacement blades for this and continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I must say I was hesitant about this as I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with shavers but I must say after receiving this free to try it was amazing. all I ever wanted was a smooth silky shave and this got the job done. I used shaving cream with it once and a dry shave the other time. I love it! will be using it from now on another thing I never cut myself with this as I did with others</li>
    <li> After receiving a free sample from Gillette, this razor works great!  The conditioners really allow for a smooth, clean shave and leave your legs feeling soft and mositerized!  Great product!</li>
    <li> I recently received a Gillette Venus with Olay Sugarberry Scent Moisture Bar razor through BzzAgent for free, to try.  I let my daughter use the razor for her first time shaving her legs.  She&#x27;s wanted to try for awhile now.  With the five blades and the Olay moisturizing bars it made my daughters first shave a very pleasant one.  The razor gave her a smooth, clean shave without any knicks or cuts.  She loved how smooth and soft her legs felt after using the Gillette razor.  The scent of the moisturizing bars is very nice and you don&#x27;t have to use any shaving cream or what I usually use, conditioner, in order to get a close, smooth shave.  The handle is extremely comfortable to use and it has no slip grips on it, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall, is that the moisturizing bars don&#x27;t last very long and you need to either buy a replacement or use shaving cream or conditioner after your first couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I would recommend this razor for a new user or for those of us who have been shaving for quite some time.</li>
    <li> I received the Venus &amp; Olay™ Razor free to try through BaaAgent. I was very impressed with the gentleness, the ease, and smoothness of the razor. The convenience is also wonderful as there is no need to apply shaving cream/gel. My daughter is new to shaving and this was the perfect starter razor for her. I would recommended to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. It was so easy to teach my daughter how to shave because u really dont need shaving cream because of the olay on the top and bottom of the blades. It glides so smoothly and does not leave u with razor bumps. Got to try this product free from gillette. I will b buying this razor for my daughter from now on</li>
    <li> I got this razor free to try from bzzagent.  My daughter loved it.  Close shave, moisterized her skin, and no razor burn. We were pleased with it!</li>
    <li> This razor is good for those thick stubborn hairs and its also great for fine hairs. Overall great versatility for anyone. I would also add that it&#x27;s gentle enough for a first time shaver. I loved the little soap bars on it and the 5 blades! I have stubborn hairs and this took care of my problem. I received my gillette venus razor free from gillette.</li>
    <li> * I received this razor for FREE from Gillette to try out *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this razor to my 13 year old daughter to take on vacation with her. She absolutely loved it. She said that her legs felt super silky after shaving with it. She loved the Sugarberry scent. And she loved the look. I love how cool this razor looks and I think it&#x27;s pretty cool that there&#x27;s no need for shaving cream!</li>
    <li> I received this Gilette Venus &amp; Olay Sugarberry scent razor as part of a BZZcampaign for BZZagent I tried the razor I love that you do not need shave gel with this product My skin gets easily irritated when shaving but I had no trouble with this razor. My 12 year old daughter tried this razor and loved it She is a beginner at shaving and is a little  scared of the process but this razor made it so easy. She loved that she didn&#x27;t need extra shave gel that she just grabbed the razor and started shaving I liked that it had a hanger to hang in the bathtub  though you had to hang it a certain way or it fell down.&lt;br /&gt;All  in all it was a great experience I would buy refills for this razor except they are very expensive That is really my only gripe that the blades do not last long  or at least the moisture strips do not  and  they are pricey to replace but if I see a good sale I would buy them for my daughter</li>
    <li> One of my favorite razors I&#x27;ve used so far! Love the olay moisturizer and the scent!!! Very close shave and it didn&#x27;t even feel like shaving at all!</li>
    <li> This razor does give an extremely close shave (at least for me!), but it has a couple of cons.  First of all, I got to try it for free through BzzAgent.  The packaging is awesome, easy to get into but sturdy enough to survive the mail.  I like the design of the razor as well.  It shaved my legs amazingly, no soap or shaving cream needed.  The moisturizing bars are a bit slimy, but if you are shaving in the shower that isn&#x27;t an issue.  It is NOT easy to shave your bikini area with because of it&#x27;s size.  I missed quite a few places. Also, my legs seemed extremely dry afterwards.  With shaving cream, my legs aren&#x27;t so dry.  It gets three stars because the shave was INCREDIBLY close and I had no stubble at the end of the day.  It is shorts season after all!  :)  So, it was okay.  For the price, I won&#x27;t be buying it for myself or my daughter.</li>
    <li> Love these razors.  What a great, smooth, clean clean moisturizing shave they were.  My skin was left refreshed and feeling clean.  Thanks #BZZAGENT for introducing me to something new and free to try.  I really love these razors!  #GotItForFree</li>
    <li> This razor is great. I received one free from Gillette and my teenage daughter and I both love the razor. It provides a nice close shave and leaves the skin feeling nice and silky. There is no need for any shaving cream or any moisturizer afterwards. I highly recommend this razor and truly believe that it is a spectacular razor for a first shave. Every girl should use it for her first shave.</li>
    <li> The Venus &amp; Olay Razor is simply amazing! My daughter and I both have sensitive skin. So with that in mind,  I will admit that I was a bit hesitant about using this new razor, but much to my amazement, it didn&#x27;t bother us one bit! We both now have the softest legs, I think we&#x27;ve ever had! If you have sensitive or dry skin then, this is the razor for you!</li>
    <li> Love this razor!! Close, smooth shave and no razor burn! Will be purchasing this in the near future! Thank you Gillette for my free sample! :)</li>
    <li> My daughters and I loved the close shave it gave us, and how smooth it left our legs feeling. And let lets not forget the great smell of the Sugarberry! Thank you Gillette for sending me one to try for free!</li>
    <li> Love the razor and the smoothness you get from it. I like that I can go a couple of days without needing to shave. I am not a big fan of the olay bars around it. I am scared it will break off while shaving</li>
    <li> I have 3 teen daughters that used it. They said it was hard to get a close shave. BUT it did leave their legs silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor through Bzz Agent.  I normally use a standard razor and use soap for my &#x27;shaving cream&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;First, I was surprised at how the blades were somewhat hidden among the Olay product and was unsure about it contacting my skin and shaving well.  It did shave well, but I was kind of off-set by the goo trail it showed when I lifted the razor off the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Also, I had to change my shower routine because of the Olay.  I normally let my conditioner sit on my hair while I shave and then rinse off after I am done shaving.  I noticed after 2 weeks my hair becoming brittle and having split ends.  Since this is the only thing I have changed, I suspect the Venus/Olay razor.  I changed the order I did things and my hair returned to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, after 3 weeks of 3x a week use, I noticed that the razor no longer shaves well and I have to retrace paths a few times. For the price of the razor, this is a little faster than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, If you are looking for a conditioning razor and don&#x27;t want to hassle with shaving cream, this is a good razor.  For me, I will go back to my &#x27;el-cheapos&#x27; as they perform about the same and last as long.</li>
    <li> I do not like this product, from the reviews i read, it works well and leave a smooth skin. But the truth is it is first hard to get a nice lather to form a protection, it works not so well and leave lot of hairs un-shaved.</li>
    <li> I got this as a sample and LOVE IT!!.  It leaves your skin feeling soft and offers a close shave.  I will definitely continue to use this razor.</li>
    <li> I got this free to try from BzzAgent,and so glad i did my daughter loves it.She has course hair on her legs and under arms,and the 5 blades work great.The first time she used it she was like OMG mom feel my legs they were smooth,and  we both loves the smell.She was good to shave 3 or 4 days later.I think the olay in it makes your skin soft...</li>
    <li> My daughter and I received this from Gillette for free to try out. It does shave closely and leaves ya smooth and soft. But, the moisture bars get in the way and do not last very long, even if it is stored out of the shower stall. Definitely not going to be purchasing this product for ourselves in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit it.... I HATE shaving my legs. I find it a huge inconvenience and time waster.  I resorted to using an electric razor because it was the easiest, but I didn&#x27;t get that &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; shave I like. Lets face it, shaving in the shower is not an easy task!  First you put the shaving gel on and then try to maneuver in such a way that the gel doesn&#x27;t wash off while you are trying to shave.  Then I ALWAYS end up nicking myself at least once.  Well.... NOT ANYMORE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Venus &amp; Olay Razor has answered my prayers!  I received the product for free from Gillette and was excited to try it.  After getting my legs wet, I shaved my legs using just the razor (no gel). Guess what?! It went super-fast, I didn&#x27;t nick my legs once and it left my legs super smooth and soft. The magic must be in the Olay Moisture Bars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must have for every woman!</li>
    <li> BZZAgent sent me a sample for my daughter and I try. It was easy to use and it was the first time my daughter had shaved her legs they were so smooth and soft. This razor is not others that will niche you and make you bleed. It even comes with a holder that sticks to the side of your tub so you won&#x27;t lose it. I recommend this razor to all girls and women of all ages!</li>
    <li> We got a free razor from Gillette and we love it! My daughter who just started shaving said she feels safe using it, and that she only wants to use this one.  We found that the layer of soap makes her feel safer.  She did not even cut herself when using it for the first time.  I have since purchased one for myself, and I would have to agree that it does work well.  It leaves our skin feeling really smooth and I too feel safer.  I mean who likes to get cut! OUCH!  I would recommend this for moms to try and then go from there to see how they feel about letting their daughters use it.  We can also purchase it at almost all of our local grocery stores, pharmacies as well as bigger retailers such as Walmart or Target.  This alone makes it nice because its convenient to find.  We are pleased.</li>
    <li> Both my 13 year old daughter and I have one of these razors that we received free from Gillette and we both love it. I&#x27;m a fast shaver and I don&#x27;t cut my legs up when I use this one, and she&#x27;s somewhat new to shaving and she&#x27;s free of cuts.</li>
    <li> The Venus &amp; Olay Razor is fabulous! My daughter &amp; I both love the way it leaves our legs feel! No bumps or rash left behind and a very smooth close shave! I was a little concerned about 5 blades but I&#x27;ve never used a smoother razor. My daughter experienced no issues with more blades then usual either.  Not to mention the blades lasted until the Moisture Bars were completely used. The refills are a little expensive for us. My daughter and I both really like the Venus &amp; Olay razor and would definitely recommend!! Thank you Venus &amp; Olay Razor and BzzAgent for allowing us to try this product free!</li>
    <li> Although I was sent this free to review, I was ok with it. I liked it in the beginning and it was good for 2 shaves before the head swelled and fell off. (Lotion and softening strip). I will try it again hoping that it was a one time thing. I really did like how soft my legs were after using.</li>
    <li> I love Venus brand razors and this razor was extra nice, however there is an issue with the olay strips. They work through a couple shaves and then the strip falls off. Leaving you with just the razor.</li>
    <li> I received a free Gillette Venus and Olay Sugarberry Scented Razor from Gillette to try out.  I tried it and it works great.  Very easy to use.  The 5 blades cut close to the skin and the moisturizing bars moisturizes and conditions your legs.  This razor worked so well that I gave one to my 12 year old daughter so she could use it.  She also enjoyed using it because it left her skin feeling so soft.  We would both highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this razor!  I have never tried a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; razor before, so this was my first time pampering myself with a great shave.  I have always used the disposable kind due to the price.  Well, you get what you pay for!  I usually cut myself at least once a week with my normal disposable razors, but never once did I cut myself with the Venus and Olay Razor.  It was very easy to use, and had a strip of Olay soap built into the razor to soothe dry legs and make shaving easier.  My 12 year old daughter recently started shaving her underarms, and she really thinks it is easy to use.  It is a very feminine razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to many smooth shaves in the future!</li>
    <li> I received a Venus &amp; Olay Razor free from Gillette to try out.  At the begging it was hard to get a close shave, but after a couple of uses I was able to get a close shave.  I liked that it really left my legs feeling smooth, and the handle is not slippery. But I did not like the bulkiness of the razor with the olay moister bars, even thou the olay bars leave your skin smooth they are also bulky and prevent you from maneuvering too much, like under my arms or knees.  Once the bars start to wear down it becomes more difficult to shave.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I really like the Venus &amp; Olay razor.  It gave a very smooth and close shave that other razors are not able to do.  The way the razor is designed feels comfortable to hold on to.  I am very grateful to have gotten to try this razor out for free...Thank you Gillette!! I would definitely recommend this razor to others who are not satisfied with their current razor.</li>
    <li> The Venus &amp; Olay Razor is great! My daughter &amp; I both love the way it leaves our legs feel! No bumps or rash left behind and a very smooth close shave! Even in a rush the handle has a nice grip and is easy to use with soapy hands. I was a little concerned about 5 blades but I&#x27;ve never used a nicer razor. The blades lasted until after the Moisture Bars were completely used and still left us wih smooth nic-free legs. The refills are expensive for us but they are definitely worth the cost when you factor in how long they last in comparison to other disposable razors. My daughter and I both really like the Venus &amp; Olay razor and would definitely recommend!! Thank you Venus &amp; Olay Razor and BzzAgent for allowing us to try this product free!</li>
    <li> THE BEST I EVER USED AND DO NOT FORGET ALSO GET THE OLAY SHAVER GEL!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Sugarberry Scent Razor free from Gillette through Buzzagent to try. I loved the smell of the Sugarberry straight out of the package and couldn&#x27;t wait to try. The razor is so easy to use, and I was excited that I didn&#x27;t have to use extra shaving cream. The handle is really nicely and very easy to hold. I got a nice smooth shave mostly but had some problems around curvy areas where the huge razor head seemed to be a problem. I also noticed during the first shave, the Olay bars left gooey, slimy strands of Olay all over my legs as I was shaving. My second shave also had my legs covered in slime, but the Olay bars were starting to melt away, so it wasn&#x27;t as bad. After the third shave, the bottom bar was completely dissolved, and the top bar was just barely holding on and the blades were already beginning to dull. After the Olay bars are completely dissolved, the tabs that held them on make the razor unusable anyway. Not what I expected for a really nice razor because the cheaper disposable razors I normally use last a LOT longer. Considering the cost of replacement heads and my experience, I don&#x27;t believe this would be an item I would continue to use.</li>
    <li> Im so glade I recieved the new Gillette Venus and Olay Razor from Gillette to try for free. It is awesome how smooth and soft my legs feel from it. My legs have never been so silky. I have definitely found my nrw Razor. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay razor free from Gillette for testing purposes &amp;&lt;br /&gt;I am in LOVE with this razor!! The Gillette Venus Razor with Olay moisture bars is by far the best razor I have ever used! I have always been afraid of 5 blade razors because I don&#x27;t like getting knicks or razor burn. But this razor is the best!!! I have not knicked my skin once and it always leaves my skin feeling smooth and does not leave any stubble on my legs or under arms I also love that I don&#x27;t have to use any shaving cream because the Olay moisture bars give enough moisture and makes shaving more quicker. I love how the razor is easy to handle and the head moves with the curves of my legs and under my arms. I also think that the color is very cute and attractive and will help young girls feel more comfortable using this razor. It may not seem like a big deal but I know when I was younger I always liked more cute looking thins over plain colored things. I only wish the replacements cost less. For me with out a coupon deal they are too expensive. I do plan on buying more when I see coupons or a in store deal. It was also a bit hard for me to get the holder to stick to my shower wall but I think it may have been from the tile I have because I finally got it to stick. I will be buying more Gillette Venus Razors with Olay moisture bars in the future.</li>
    <li> Gillette has two varieties of the Venus &amp; Olay razors: this Sugarberry scented one and [[ASIN:B0072K0SP8 Gillette Venus and Olay Razor]]. They both perform the same with the only difference being the scent. The Gillette Venus and Olay razor doesn&#x27;t state it but it smells like warm vanilla, which I prefer over the Sugarberry scent. The Sugarberry scent is very faint and fades fast after initial use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor gives a close, smooth shave on the legs but does not work as well on the underarms because of the bulk of the shaving bar surrounding the razor. The plus side of the shaving bar&#x27;s size is it keeps me from nicking myself in the underarm area. The shaving bar on the razor lathers up quickly initially but with each use it lathers less. The lather the first few uses is a little slimy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My legs are less than average hairy and I only shave from the knee down since I don&#x27;t have any hair on the thighs so I was able to use this razor to shave my underarms every day and my legs about three times a week for 2 1/2 weeks before I felt like I needed to change the razor. I didn&#x27;t need to use any soap (I don&#x27;t use shaving creams) for the first week but by the second week I did use soap while shaving because by this point the shaving bar is 2/3 less it&#x27;s original size and doesn&#x27;t lather very well however the razor blades are still giving a smooth shave if not as moisturizing as the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Venus &amp; Olay razor does moisturize the legs and I never felt dry from shaving or razor burn which is a problem I have with most razors after shaving even the [[ASIN:B003EMPN7G Gillette Venus Original Razor, 1 Razor 2 Cartridges, 1-count Package]]. I&#x27;m switching the Venus &amp; Olay razor from the Original Venus even though the refill razors cost more. I think the cost difference is worth not having razor burn or dry, tight skin after shaving.</li>
    <li> I really like this razor. I&#x27;m a lazy shaver and I don&#x27;t usually use shaving cream and sometimes I don&#x27;t even use soap. That makes the built-in lubricant bars on this razor super awesome. The bars are lightly scented, which I like because if the smell was really strong I would barf. I was worried that the bars would get in the way of a close shave but that didn&#x27;t happen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve long used Gillette razors for shaving.  This new combination of Olay moisturizing block along with the precision and sharpness of four Venus blades makes for a perfectly smooth shave every time.  I have not nicked myself even when shaving quickly, the Sugarberry fragrance is light and heavenly, and the creamy moisture strips above and below the blades make my skin feel silky and soft.  The pivot action on the blades and comfortable handle all add to the convenience of this terrific little razor.  I noticed that the refills are quite costly, and the Olay moisture blocks might very well outlast the blades, so I will use this interchangeably with my less expensive disposable razors.  Comes with a suction cup holder which doesn&#x27;t like to stay put once you hang the razor up, so I just ditched it and keep the razor in the bathroom cabinet.  Love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love venus razors but this definitely has room for improvement. The conditioner around the razor tends to fall off and you go through it very fast. It does smell good and it does provide a really close shave which I love. But the conditioner could use some help. My razor was provided by a program run by Gillette Venus.</li>
    <li> Here is another razor with gel strips so you don&#x27;t have to use a separate shaving gel.  Unlike previous incarnations, these gel strips do not turn gooey when wet.  I received a close shave on my legs.  A week later and still no stubble.  It comes with one of those suction cup holders for the shower.  Frankly, those are just a waste as they constantly fall off in the middle of the night.  It would make more sense to come with a plastic cover so the razor would be more portable.  Without a cover I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a travel razor because of the gel strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if only the makers of razors would spend their time inventing a razor that doesn&#x27;t rust.</li>
    <li> The Olay/Gilette razor indeed does provide for a comfortable shave, with minimal irritation. However, I did not the find the blade particularly effective, and had to &#x27;go over&#x27; the same areas several times for full hair removal.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! The five blades provide a gentle but complete shaving experience! I used it on my legs and underarms without ever feeling that it was scraping or irritating my skin. The color and styling are also a plus, however what counts is how well it works. I&#x27;ve tried many razor brands and this one is definitely my favorite!!!</li>
    <li> I like Venus and Olay Razors.  A bit pricey but the 5 blades give a close shave and using the hanging tool keeps it dry leading to a long life for the razor.  Because I use it in the shower with scented shower gels the scent didn&#x27;t add anything to the experience for me.</li>
    <li> I really like the gel bars on this razor. I thought it helped with shaving my legs and did not dry them out. Plus I didn&#x27;t have to bother with shaving cream, which I hate doing. In addition, I like the razors, which I thought cut very well and it made my legs smooth. I&#x27;ve tried many razors and I think this one does the best at shaving my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the smell, but I could always buy a different kind. It is a bit sugary, and I wasn&#x27;t happy with it, but it also didn&#x27;t make me stop using the razor either because I loved the results. Now, the gel bars I noticed tend to break down quickly, or maybe its my long hot showers that eat away at them.  But after a few uses I saw they were significantly smaller. The blades were still good though, so I continued to use the razor. Now, I will say that I share a bathroom with two other people, so maybe the moisture is eating away at the gel bars. I&#x27;m unsure. Those were the two issues I had with this razor, and frankly they aren&#x27;t big enough issues to make me not want to use this. In fact I think I have found a new razor. I love the way it glides over my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product in the future.</li>
    <li> as much as I really enjoy using Gillette brand razors, I have always shied away from their products that included shave gel bars on the razor blade.  I find they get gooey, do not tend to dry well and then you get a shorter life span of the razor.  The Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Sugarberry Scent Razor 1 Kit had a blade with the shave gel bar but I found the scent pleasing and the shave gel bar to work well if you are using this razor to shave your legs.  It required me to press the blade down slightly harder on my leg in order to have the blade reach my skin, but once I adjusted my expectations, i found the razor did a great job of shaving my leg, with or without using additional shaving cream.  I found it did not do as fantastic of a job on the underarm area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely use the product again, especially if traveling as I would not need to bring shaving cream.  The other major negative is that the kit only comes with one blade, thus requiring you to purchase several additional blades.  all in all, I would go out and purchase extra blade to use.</li>
    <li> I love that you don&#x27;t need shaving cream. Even without an ounce of shaving cream, lotion or body wash, you don&#x27;t have to worry about irritation or razor burn. If thats ur concern, this is the razor for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, the shave wasn&#x27;t very good and the size is clunky. No matter that i went over every area a few times, i still have some stubble on my legs. It is also hard to shave your armpits or weird knee angles because its a bit awkward and clunky. Say goodbye to shaving your armpits quickly in a t-shirt bc the olay stuff will go everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rather invest in some cheap shaving cream and get an awesome shave, stubble free, then use this razor</li>
    <li> I just received my Venus &amp; Olay razor in the mail for free as part of a campaign. I absolutely love it! My legs feel so silky and smooth, and the scent is to die for. It filled my bathroom with a delicious aroma, and my legs still smell yummy! The only complaint I have is that the moisture bars dissolve a bit quickly, and I wish I could hold on to that moisture longer!</li>
    <li> If you can purchase this razor at a decent price under the regular price of 8.99+... I enjoy using this brand of razor it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap and I like how it gives off its own moisture to give you an easy shave.  It gives you a very soft after shave feeling.  The smell is okay.. Just be careful handling the product sometimes you can scrape some of the product around the razor under your finger nail.. would I recommend ? Yes.. Would I buy again Yes.. This is one of my favorites!  I also received this for free for the exchange of my opinions about the razor.. Yay Me!</li>
    <li> So perfect! It was like Olay and Venus got together and had the perfect child. I am hooked on this razor. It is the closest shave I have ever had. The blades last a lot longer than any other razor I have ever used. I don&#x27;t get razor burn anymore either. my legs are so silky smooth that even my boyfriend has happily noticed. Gillette send this to me free of charge so it was like a free little goodie sent from heaven!</li>
    <li> I recently received the Venus&amp;Olay Razor from a program run by Gillette Venus. I have to say I love the razor. I enjoyed how the 5 blades get even the smallest hair and left my legs smooth and I didn&#x27;t even have to use shave cream.</li>
    <li> So yesterday I just got the Venus and Olay razor from a program run by Gillete Venus ! I was so super exited,first of all the packaging is cute,I love the pink color of the handle and the gel on the handle,It&#x27;s very comfortable to handle/use.I really love the scent,I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling the razor in the shower because it smelled that good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience in actually using the razor was very good, the razor glides very smoothly,I love the fact I do not have to use shaving cream thanks to the gel bars! All the hair i was shaving off came off on the first run through, unlike some razors i have tried that i would have to run through same spot a couple of times before all the hair was taken off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my shaving session in the shower, my legs felt unbelievably smooth and silky, i couldn&#x27;t stop touching them the whole day ! Over all I loved this razor, and i recommended it to my sister and mom and will recommend this product to my friends!</li>
    <li> I got this razor in a program run by Gillette and I loved it! The scent is wonderful a nice fruity sweet scent that&#x27;s not overbearing or cloying. The razor handle is shaped well for your hand and the shape of the head works well gliding over the curves of your legs. The five razors makes your skin so smooth and it&#x27;s really nice to not have to deal with soaping up your legs or using shaving cream. The lotion bars on the razor work really well to give you a nice smooth feeling as you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problems with it is the packaging was a bit much and the shower hook was a little hard to figure out in terms of making the razor stay in.</li>
    <li> I got this product from a program run by Gillette Venus, got my razor this morning and used this after noon and can say that the Gillette venus and olay razor is an amazing product! I have always had really dry skin and no matter what I did after shaving I have little stubbles , not with this product it totally moisturized my legs leaving them smooth. The package was easy to open no sitting in the shower trying to rip it open with my teeth. I will be buying replacement blades and switching fully to this product.</li>
    <li> I got this Venus &amp; Olay razor through a program run by Gillette Venus. I loved this product it smells fantastic and the 5 blades combined with the Olay Soap/lotion bars is amazing. I highly recommend this razor and will be buying it in the future!</li>
    <li> I had an opportunity to try the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Razor through a program ran by the company and I was very please with the result. I was a bit apprehensive about trying the razor since it calls for you not use shaving gel. The razor which is enclosed with 2 bars of Olay Sugarberry Moisture Bars smelled so sweet and flowery. Upon shaving my skin ended up very silky and smooth. Included was a little stand that you can stick to the wall in your shower and hang your razor in-between shaves. The 2 things I dislike was that the olay moisture bars have already become a bit loose so I don&#x27;t know if they are going to stay intact long. As well as the stand does not work because the razor won&#x27;t fit properly. But other than that I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I received the razor through a program run by Gillette Venus. I loved the 5 blades. You don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream to use the razor. It made my legs very smooth and the smell was light and not overpowering. It came with a shower holder that suctions on the wall which came in handy. I will be recommending this razor to friends in need!</li>
    <li> This razor was provided by a program that was run by Gillette Venus, but just because it was provided for me, will not change my opinion on this.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be honest, I was really skeptical when I got this. I started reading the package, and read the instructions. It told me to wet the razor with water for a light lather.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and I get razor burn really easily, so I was really nervous to not be using some sort of shave gel or soap.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Venus &amp; Olay&#x27;s 5 blade technology exfoliates for surface skin renewal.&lt;br /&gt;Sugarberry scented Olay Moisture Bars help lock-in moisture to your skin for less dryness.&lt;br /&gt;Soft grip handle for confident control.&lt;br /&gt;Gently exfoliates and helps replenish skin&#x27;s moisture.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor has 5 blades, Olay Moisture Bars on the top and bottom, a comfortable handle, and it exfoliates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had NO reason to be worried!&lt;br /&gt;This surpassed my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;The moisture bars on this razor are amazing. This razor didn&#x27;t irritate my legs like I&#x27;d expected, it didn&#x27;t dry my legs out, and it left my legs feeling soft, smooth, closely shaven, and very moisturized. Also, the comfort grip handle on this is very nice. I usually have problems with my razors slipping all over the place when I try to shave my legs, but this was really easy to keep a hold of and control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have problems with sensitive, dry, easily irritated legs, don&#x27;t be afraid to buy this razor. Being a person who has all of those problems - this is honestly going to be my new go to razor. I definitely don&#x27;t see myself going back to any other razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one con about this that I really did not like at all, though - and that was the scent. The scent is really too strong for my liking. I took one whiff of this and it was a really strong . It doesn&#x27;t smell too bad after using it and it does die down, but it&#x27;s the initial shock of the smell at first. I would have preferred it be a softer smell, but it is easy to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you don&#x27;t like heavily scented products such as the smell of Sugarberry, don&#x27;t let it stop you from getting this - as the smell does die down after the first use or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really, really love this razor. I was surprised with how great this is.&lt;br /&gt;Go give it a try!y to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you don&#x27;t like heavily scented products such as the smell of Sugarberry, don&#x27;t let it stop you from getting this - as the smell does die down after the first use or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really, really love this razor. I was surprised with how great this is.&lt;br /&gt;Go give it a try!</li>
    <li> Today I tried my new Venus &amp; Olay razor in sugarberry for the first time. I received the razor from a program led by the company, and right away the packaging caught my eye! With pink and yellow and sparkles, this razor is sure to stand out to a lot of people trying to pick out a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor was extremely easy to assemble (attach the head to the handle)and even came with a neat suctioned drying hanger for my shower wall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I began to shave with this new razor I immediately noticed how silky smooth it felt running across my leg. The Olay moisture bars really do prep your legs and moisturize at the same time, making shaving cream a thing of the past! In no time at all my legs were smooth and hair free; much faster than an average razor having to put on shaving cream and going over every spot twice. This Venus &amp; Olay sugarberry razor got it right the first time, with no hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this razor is the &#x27;snail slime&#x27; left behind after every swipe across my legs. The Olay moisture bars left behind a sticky goopy material, but this all washed away instantly leaving legs silky smooth and ready to face the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this razor to any woman (or man) who is tired of the long process that is shaving cream. The Venus &amp; Olay sugarberry razor has just raised the standard on shaving!</li>
    <li> Such a smooth shave and the scented handle leaves my bathroom smelling yummy. Would def recommend trying this razor. Only thing that could make it better would be a more flexible razor head.</li>
    <li> First Time actually using a nice razor. I got this product via a program run by Gillette Venus.  I usually get the cheep razors but after using this razor I will never buy the cheep ones again! The 5 blades don&#x27;t irritate my skin and makes my legs so smooth! Totally recommend it. Very impressed.</li>
    <li> This razor worked well for me! My legs were smooth for two days with no irritation. Plus the scent was quite amazing and added to the experience. I usually have sensitive skin when it comes to shaving and this razor left no irritation, I was pleased with this and will buy more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of the Venus brand razors for a while now, so I was excited with having the privilege to try out their new Venus &amp; Olay in Sugarberry via a program by Gillette. The packaging itself is nice to look at with various sparkles and bright color. I was impressed with how easy to open and access the contents was--just pull back the top and the razor slides right out. Immediately I noticed the smell and thought it was lovely. The razor itself looks similar to the other Venus razors but white and pink. The handle has a very rubbery feel to it which allows for better gripping which is very handy if you&#x27;re trying to shave odd angles. The major thing that separated this razor from the rest is the bulky moisturizing bars adjacent to the blades. They&#x27;re massive! At first I thought it would be a problem to shave with, but it wasn&#x27;t so bad... One interesting tidbit that I read about was that this razor did not need shaving cream. I decided to try this out and was pleasantly surprised that it worked! When the moisturizing bars get wet they start getting very sticky which provides enough lubrication for a gentle shave. I was honestly impressed by this and didn&#x27;t need to use shaving cream at all. It was great while shaving my legs; however, when I tried my underarms, I had difficulty maneuvering the razor because of how bulky it was. It was almost impossible to get some hairs. Also, it isn&#x27;t exactly moisturizing. I noticed it did moisturize a little bit, but I still needed lotion after my shower. The bars also do not seem to last that long, unfortunately. Which is not so bad since you can still use the razor, you just have to use shaving cream. Overall, I recommend this razor. It does not require shaving cream (until the moisturizing bar runs out), it doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as it advertises, and the bulky bars could hinder other areas of your body to be shaven, but it really is a great, simple razor when it comes down to it.</li>
    <li> I was always a bit of a sceptic when it came to moisture bars on razors.  I usually buy the cheap disposable razors and those seem to have worked just fine in the past.  But I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing!  After receiving the Venus &amp; Olay Razor (provided through a program run by Gillette Venus), I&#x27;m a changed woman.  It smells amazing, it feels amazing, my legs had no idea what they were missing out on!  No razor burn, perfect close shave, and the softness will last long after I&#x27;m done using the product.  I&#x27;ve used it for a couple weeks  and the blades don&#x27;t seem any less effective than the day I opened it.  Buh-Bye cheap razors,I WILL be buying this product.</li>
    <li> I have used the Venus &amp; Olay razor twice and it&#x27;s amazing. I have not found any flaws to this product. I love the thick moisture bars because they add lubrication and keep my legs hydrated. This is very nice for people who use soap or shave dry. I also feel like because the bars are pretty big, they help prevent my from nicking myself. The five blades make for a close and smooth shave. I honestly really like this razor. I definitely recommend it. The sugarberry smell is also very yummy!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Venus and Olay Razor in Sugarberry does provide a pretty close shave. I began using the razor about a week ago after receiving the opportunity through a program run by Gillette Venus. The razor provides two moisture bars which is great because is takes away the necessity of having a shaving cream!I would rate this product five stars but the moisture bars don&#x27;t last as long as I would have hoped as they are a bit on the smaller side. Other than that the product was great! I definitely would recommend this for everyone to try at least once!</li>
    <li> I received the razor from a program ran by Gillette Venus and I really enjoyed the product. my legs were very smooth and there wasn&#x27;t any need for shaving cream or soap or anything along those lines. I really recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> After using this product I was a little disappointed. I saw the effects of strawberry legs (little blacks dots) even right after the shower. The razor didn&#x27;t get as close a shave as other razor I have used. I didn&#x27;t feel the my legs being exfoliated. However, the use of shaving cream isn&#x27;t needed since the lotion bars were moisturizing enough and didn&#x27;t leave my legs dry. I don&#x27;t recommend this product especially if you have dark or coarse hair like I do.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using this razor! It smells great and it is super moisturizing for my dry legs! It&#x27;s also really great that i don&#x27;t have to pay extra money on shaving cream. My only issue is that the bars seem to run out very quickly, but it&#x27;s overall a great razor.</li>
    <li> the scent was pretty yummy smelling, but it didnt do as advertized-leave my legs soft and silkier than ever\\&quot; it wasnt as close a shave as id like either.</li>
    <li> This razor is beyong fabulous! It removes hair in one stroke, and no worries about cuts! It is so perfect especiialy in the summer! I love it!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes shaving so easy. Not to mention it smells great. I would highly recommend this product. Especially with summer here it&#x27;s a must.</li>
    <li> I have always been a big fan of the Venus razors, so I was very excited to be invited to test this product, sponsored through a trial program by Gilette Venus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the product, the first thing I noticed was the packaging. I guess they took people like me, who hate cutting through that annoying plastic into consideration. There was a pre-cut slit in the package, so you could just flip it back and it toar open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this razor earlier today, and to my surprise, it worked pretty well! I was a bit skeptical about trying the product where you didn&#x27;t have to use shaving cream, but you actually don&#x27;t have to use any for most of the shaving. The rubber handles on the side definitely make it a lot easier to hold while you&#x27;re shaving. I did find that while you&#x27;re shaving your sensitive areas, you should probably use a little bit of shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the experience was pretty pleasant. I will definitely be purchasing this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> I first recieved this product through a program run by Gillete Venus and was very excited to try it! I mean who wouldn&#x27;t be excited by a product that claimed I&#x27;d never have to buy shaving cream again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the Sugarberry scent smelled great. As the product promises, I did not need to use any sort of shaving cream or lotion, the razor guided across my skin very easily and left it very moisturized. The 5 blades provided me with a close shave that lasted for two days. I was very impressed with the way that Gillette was able to combine the two products and give me an overall satisfying experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did not like about this product was how wuickly the Olay soap bars were used up. I was able to use this razor four times before getting nervous that I would get cut. With the price of the refill cartridges adding up to about $5 per refill, I do not think I would buy them again unless they were to last me a bit longer. If the price doesn&#x27;t sway you give it a try! I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Why haven&#x27;t these two brands come together sooner? I have always loved Venus razors. They are hands down the best razors on the market today. Now, they have become even better with the inclusion of Olay Moisture Bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this razor from Gillette Venus to give my opinion about the new product. I had yet to find a razor/shaving cream combination that is worth the money, until now. In the past, I have used other razor/shaving cream products; but they have always either been too clunky, or the shaving cream component did not last more than a shave or two. This is not the case with the Venus &amp; Olay Razor. This razor is 1/3 of the size of other razor/shaving cream combos. This makes it much easier and less annoying to shave. The moisture bar also lasted three times longer than the other brand I&#x27;ve used in the past. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this razor. I&#x27;m kissing shaving cream goodbye!</li>
    <li> The razor I got was provided via a program run by Gillette Venus and let me tell you, It is amazing. I mean from the 5 blades to the great smell, I cant stop using it. The one downfall I would have to say is that when I do shave the moisture bars get extremely slimy and that is a turn off because I feel covered in lotion in the shower. But nonetheless, I love it !</li>
    <li> Recently, I was provided a Venus &amp; Olay(tm) Razor via a program run by Gillette Venus.  This razor will change your shaving experience!  Standing in an isle with many different razors, we always wonder which one is the best for our legs.  So many questions run through our minds such as the following: \\&quot;How well does it shave the hair;\\&quot; \\&quot;Will my legs feel smooth or rough;\\&quot; \\&quot;Do I need shaving cream;\\&quot; \\&quot;How long will the shave last?\\&quot; From my personal experience, I can answer all of those questions for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The moment I opened the removable blade package, the aroma of sugarberry escaped. It smells absolutely wonderful! The razor handle is very similar to the other Venus razors. Easy to assemble, I was ready to begin my new shaving experience. One benefit to this razor, there is not a need for shaving cream. I know; I was in denial! Just moisten your legs with water, and voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  With the built in Olay shaving cream bar, your legs will feel creamy and smooth! Unlike generic razors, I only had to shave each area one time; one swipe equals no hair. Using shaving cream in the shower with regular razors will always wash away before you get a chance to shave. With the Venus &amp; Olay Razor, you can shave in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  After shaving, I noticed my legs stayed \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; free three days more than the average razor.  Seeing that I used to shave every other day, I now only have to shave with this razor once a week. It truly is amazing how close to your skin the razor shaves the hair! After shaving with it twice, the razor still has the wonderful sugarberry scent and looks unused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I am very thankful I tried the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Razor. You will not be disappointed if you try it too! Don&#x27;t hesitate to pick it up and put it in the cart the next time you are at the store! I now have silky smooth legs to show off without those unexpected \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; patches. Look out summer, these babies are going to be strutting her stuff!</li>
    <li> I received my razor via a program run by Gillette Venus.&lt;br /&gt;After the first time I shaved, I lovvveeeddd my legs! They were as smooth as a babies bottom!! I was so glad that it was finally short season! The shave even lasted for the next day, which fo me is huge! And it was a huge timesaver because I didn&#x27;t have to put lotion on after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;The only down side was that after just a few shaves the creamy bars wore down really quickly and the razor alone does not work all that well. And comparing that to the leg I just had a few days prior I was a little bummed. So this is kind of a problem because I shave my legs so often.</li>
    <li> This razor was very easy to use and the scent was lovely as well. I am not a huge fan of the attached no shaving cream shave gel because it gets gross, but it is very convenient if you don&#x27;t like using shaving cream. This razor lasted a handful of times and got a close shave.</li>
    <li> Getting this razor was great I have enjoyed it I am a person who always nicks my legs when I shave.With this I had none It added a lot of extra moisture to my dry skin. I was not a huge fan of the smell I would like an unscented one even though the smell does wash off it is strong when you first use it. But other then that this gives a close clean nick free moisturizing shave.</li>
    <li> This product is more expensive than other razors, but it&#x27;s worth it if you have room in your budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this as a sample from a program run by Gillette Venus. The handle it came with is pretty spiffy! Nice and rubbery so you have a great grip all through the shave. The razor itself is excellent and very hydrating. I absolutely loved the scent of this, but I guess it&#x27;s all preference. Another reviewer described it as \\&quot;cartoon cupcake,\\&quot; which seems a bit beyond my experience, but it is definitely a very sweet scent more than a more mature one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem with this product is that I&#x27;ve only used it to shave once, and the moisture bars (which basically IS why this razor is more expensive) is already half gone. I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s just something to do with the shaping and that it actually will last more than 2 shaves altogether with the awesome moisture bars intact, but time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, if you have room in your budget.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try this product for free, and since it promises a phenomenally close shave and super smooth skin, why wouldn&#x27;t I jump at the chance? In exchange for the free razor, here&#x27;s what I thought:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1). This razor gives a phenomenally close shave and super smooth skin. It promises it, and it comes through with it.&lt;br /&gt;2). It&#x27;s ridiculously convenient not to have to use shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;3). Keeping my razor hanging on a suction cup holder in my shower? Yes, please!&lt;br /&gt;4). The scent is not overpowering, as some have said; it&#x27;s not the best scent in the world, but it doesn&#x27;t linger after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;5). The razor head is too large and bulky for contoured areas such as under the arms. It&#x27;s possible to use it there, but it takes some maneuvering. This is really suited just for legs.&lt;br /&gt;6). I have very sensitive skin, but I have experienced no razor burn, nicks/cuts, or discomfort in the 10 days I&#x27;ve been using this razor. Plus, I haven&#x27;t had any allergic responses to the \\&quot;moisture bars.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I continue using this razor? For the time being, absolutely. It may get to be too costly for me to use it forever; the refill cartridges are pricey, and do wear down somewhat quickly. But I&#x27;m loving this razor while it lasts!</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with this razor by Gillette Venus! I have been using Shick Quatro for a while now and thought that was one of the best, but decided to give Venus &amp; Olay a try. This this razor with the Olay moisture bar definitely kept my skin softer for longer AND I feel it got an even closer shave. Definitely recommend giving this razor a try for the summer!!</li>
    <li> With my job (and being summer) I shave my legs almost every day. Most razors give me razor burn but Venus &amp; Olay Razor in Sugarberry doesn&#x27;t give me razor burn at all! I love it! The \\&quot;slime\\&quot; gives me protection as I shave and I feel the moisture after I dry myself. Buying again!</li>
    <li> I got this razor through a promotion from Gillette Venus and I must say I will definitely purchase this product in the future! The moisture bars and 5 blades make for a super close and clean shave! I&#x27;ve never liked shaving but this product made it a much more enjoyable experience. Just wet the razor and go. No shaving cream/gel required. Definitely takes all the work out of shaving! My legs are STILL silky smooth and soft after 5 days!! Highly recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> Best razor I have used in some time.  Always had a problem with razor burn, with this razor that is not a problem for me now.  My legs are smoother than ever.  I was skeptical at first but I am now a firm believer in this product.  If it weren&#x27;t for program run by Gillette Venus would never of found this item.</li>
    <li> This five blade razor is my leg savior! After refusing to use women&#x27;s razors because they suck, I finally gave in and decided that I should try this new one after all the hype. I got this razor free through a program and it lives up to its claim. It keeps my legs and especially my under arms smooth! It also prevents the little cuts that most other razors give me. It&#x27;s wonderful! I am going to be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> Thanks to a program run by Gillette Venus, I had the opportunity to try their new razor, but I must be destined to never have completely smooth legs (or perhaps I am just awful at shaving!).I love this razor because I think that the Olay moisture bars are a brilliant and genius move, but my problem with it is not the razor&#x27;s fault. After shaving, I would feel my legs and they would still be a bit stubbly, but even so, I have to say that my legs were very soft in spite of that (thanks Olay!) Overall, in my experience, this razor was nothing too special or extraordinary, but it does keep your legs soft even two days after shaving. Less hairy though? Not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are asking yourself \\&quot;What would I want to know before I get this product?\\&quot; I would say that you would want to know that if you are already a fan of Venus razors, do you think you need the extra moisture/smoothness that the Olay bars can give you? (Which they can!)</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I received this free product from Gillette to test it out, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked. The Olay Moisture Bars completely eliminate the need for soap or shaving cream. This would make the perfect travel razor, since it&#x27;s all you&#x27;d need to pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently a regular user of the original Venus 3-blade razor, and I didn&#x27;t find that the two extra blades made a difference. However, the Moisture Bars did help keep my legs smooth after the shave. I also like that it comes with a suctioned shower hanger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was pleased with this razor provided by Gillette Venus to me for free. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s any better of a razor than the original Venus razor, except for the fact that you don&#x27;t need to use shaving cream. If this is a luxury you&#x27;d prefer, then by all means get this product!</li>
    <li> I received this razor to try as a sponsored program by Venus. It DID work great for giving me a really close shave, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay extra for the soap bar attached to it. I have sensitive skin and it was a little irritating sometimes. The soap bar also didn&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> So I just shaved my legs this morning with the Venus &amp; Olay Razor, which was provided to me by a program run by Gillette Venus. I have never used a razor with the moisturizing bars before, so I was interested in trying this. Oh my gosh. My legs seriously have never been this soft after shaving. I usually wear pantyhose at work, but not today. My legs are bare and they are loving it! It&#x27;s kind of a problem because I can&#x27;t stop touching them and I really should be working. It was nice not having to lather on shaving cream and still worry about getting razor burn. I am razor burn free today! I usually use disposable razors, but I think I&#x27;ve been converted to the Venus &amp; Olay Razor!</li>
    <li> I got this via a program run by Gilette Venus. I really like this razor for quick shaves on my legs. I like the slimy/soapy bar attached to the razor, and I think it&#x27;s better than what I&#x27;ve tried before from a different brand. Seems like the blade is getting dull just as fast as ordinary razors. Overall, a good product.</li>
    <li> As a dedicated customer to the Venus razor line, I was super excited to try the Venus &amp; Olay Razor, receiving it through a program run by Gillette Venus. I was extremely impressed by the quality of this product. On first glance, I noticed that the five blades were closed together and tilted which make this razor give you a really close shave. The Olay infused bars all for an easy shower shave with no needed for shaving cream and left my legs amazingly smooth and radiant. Not only was this probably the smoothest my legs have been after shaving, but the sugar berry scent smelled great too! This razor gives you the close shave of a men&#x27;s razor but is made for women! Would recommend to anyone who is looking for great summer legs!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Venus razors before, first the \\&quot;original\\&quot; kind and then the breeze model. I&#x27;ve been pretty satisfied with the breeze and been using it for a while now so when I was contacted through a Gillette-run program to try this product, I was more than happy to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is definitely as advertised. Once it got wet, it was slick enough to use without any soap or shaving creme at all which was nice and convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades were really nice- it only took one swipe to get rid of hair. I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin on the bikini zone and underarm area, to the point in getting nicks while shaving and getting red bumps the day after even when using a shaving gel specifically for sensitive skin. I noticed that even without any shaving cream/soap that I didn&#x27;t have the inflamed skin the day after like I usually did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as nice as the blade was, the moisturizing strips are a little fragile- at least the one on the top. After two shaves using the razor, the top moisturizing strip had lost about a third of the starting amount, and was starting to come off the pieces where it was attached. The bottom moisturizing strip was still in good shape though. I don&#x27;t know if this is because I press down too much, I do press down my index finger on the blade when I shave so that could factor in. Regardless, the fragility might mean that I have to replace the razor head before the blades even get dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, the pros of not getting inflamed skin and the much quicker time it took to shave were big pluses that outweigh the con of perhaps having to replace the head earlier than I would like. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got the great joy of receiving this free product from a campaign by Gillete Venus and Olay. I found the packaging could be a little smaller, but I loved how easy it was to open. I didn&#x27;t quite notice an overbearing smell at all. It was nice and pleasant. The moisture bars offered a nice lather for my shave and I experience no tugging or nicks. The moisture effects are just as described and last for days. It is great not to have to use shaving cream or soap. It cuts one step out of my routine, and there is no price on time. I have used this razor 3 times and have not noticed a huge difference in the size of the moisture bars and it seems like they will last a very long time. The swivel head on the razor was a very nice touch as it moved and conformed to my body&#x27;s curves. I also very much appreciate wall hanger suction was an excellent addition and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I will be buying these razors from now on. I really like that in a pinch I don&#x27;t need any shaving cream. The lotion around the razor moisturizes enough that the razor glides smoothly and easily over the skin. The blades are sharp and cut close to the skin without irritating my skin. The shave lasted a few days and I was overall really happy with the razor. The scent is feminine and fun without being overpowering. I have used it 5 times and it is still going strong. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> As far as razors go, this is a good one! I was surprised to find that the scent was really nice when I opened up the package. Also, when I used the razor for the first time, I noticed that there was actually a nice slick soap- like film coming from the razor. This really helped with keeping my legs moisturized. I would definitely buy this one again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Venus razor for many years. This was just a replacement. I really like the way it leaves my legs feeling.</li>
    <li> This sweet-smelling razor gives an incredibly smooth shave, due to two big petal-like Olay lotion attachments on the top and bottom of the blades. When you use this razor it sort of feels like two big wet lips are running over your skin. The lotion attachments leave a, well, a lotion-ey trail behind, so if you don&#x27;t like that sort of thing think again. I liked it; it left me feeling pampered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The five blades are very sharp; beware of nicks, especially when you first use the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this Venus razor is terrific, if a little expensive.</li>
    <li> I think there may be some mixed reviews on the scent because it can be a little sweet.  But, overall, I thought it was a good razor and and had a good close shave.</li>
    <li> I was fortunate to experience this specific razor free. It was provided by a program run by Gillette Venus. First off I love this product! it gets down to business, getting off a good amount of hair I&#x27;d missed with other razors. It have a sweet scent, it moisturizes your skin and leaves you feeling clean.that&#x27;s it in a nutshell, the price is a hefty load in stores sometimes. Usually there are good coupons in Sundays papers (not every time though) to take care of that.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay razor kit for free through one of Gillettes programs. I do not see the sun that often. My legs look dull but are smooth. I didn&#x27;t have to use shaving creme with this razor. I just used water and started shaving. The scent is intense but beautiful and I couldn&#x27;t even tell I was shaving it cut so smooth. My biggest positive about this razor was how shiny the moisturising bars left my legs looking. I would definitely suggest this to anyone who was looking to buy a razor!! :D</li>
    <li> I received the Gilette Venus &amp; Olay Sugarberry Scented Razor as part of a program run by GiletteVenus. I was so excited when I opened the box and could smell the delightful raspberry-like scent. I loved using this razor, I didn&#x27;t nick or cut myself once, and that&#x27;s saying alot, as I shave kind of fast and rather vigorously because I&#x27;m impatient :) Right now it&#x27;s an hour and a half later and I still feel enveloped in the invigorating scent. The ONLY thing to consider about this razor, and the ONLY reason I gave it four stars, is because it doesn&#x27;t work THAT well on underarms. I would primarily use it for legs, as it&#x27;s so wide because of the attached soap, it&#x27;s hard to till which part of your skin is actually being shaved. But for legs, it is GREAT! I don&#x27;t think my legs have ever been so soft!</li>
    <li> Just kidding.&lt;br /&gt;But, maybe not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the thick and course texture that is my leg hair this razor left me with nothing but disappointments. I was so excited to receive this razor when I was accepted for a program run by Gillette Venus. The shipment came and I rushed off to tame the wild jungle beasts that are my leg hairs. Upon ripping open the package I was welcomed by a flowery fragrance. I thought things were going seemingly well as I ran those blades across my mammoth hairs. I jumped out, dried my legs and..... I was left with streaks of hair running down my legs. Landing Strips. Land Mines. Ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*sigh*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the good! The fragrance was as I have said, quite welcoming! And I can see where this razor would be very beneficial for someone with finer hair, or even perhaps a preteen just learning to shave! The moisturizing \\&quot;bumpers\\&quot; surrounding the razor would make it harder to nik one&#x27;s self, I would assume. Sadly, for me. I will have to stick with behemoth man razors. Still by Venus, but made for a man.</li>
    <li> I love this razor, I just received it free from a promo and I will definitely be buying more. It made my legs feel awesome, and I love that you don&#x27;t even need to use shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky snot my razors and I wasn&#x27;t completely sure if I wanted to try these, but I finally did. That was probably the best decision I&#x27;ve made</li>
    <li> I always use venus razors but I really love this one with the olay. I received a razor from a Venus campaign and was very impressed. My legs immediately felt smoother, and also the razor is nice and thin so its very easy to hold in the shower. I got a really close shave with this razor and I felt like I had moisturized right out of the shower. I would definitely repurchase this razor as opposed to another one. My only complaint is that the shower holder doesn&#x27;t hold multiple cartridges, however that may have just been mine because I got it through the campaign. I usually keep a few new cartridges in the shower just in case.</li>
    <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RAZOR.. I RECENTLY SWITCHED OVER TO MENS RAZORS BECAUSE THEY ARE BETTER UNTILL I TRIED THIS! 5 BLADES SO U GET THAT CLOSE SHAVE U LOVE PLUS IT EXFOLIATES YOUR SKIN WHILE SHAVING.. I DONT EVEN HAVE TO PUT ON LOTION AFTER THE SHOWER! MUST HAVE! FYI I GOT IT FOR FREE!! the razor was provided via a program run by Gillette Venus.</li>
    <li> I was curious to see if this razor would actually provide results without shaving cream and it did! My legs and underarms are smooth with no nicks or scratches. However, the moisture bars are very fragile and can be broken off with fingernails. Just be careful! The wall holder comes in handy, though I did find the packaging to be a bit excessive for the product that it contained. I&#x27;d like to see if they come out with any other scents and perhaps strengthen the moisture bars. I did not feel the exfoliating factor, but moisturizing is more important to me!</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the worst razors in its price range. The packaging looks great, but, you cannot get a close shave due to the moisture bars. When the moisture bars aren&#x27;t blocking access to the razor, they are slimming up the blades and making shaving much more difficult than it needs to be. Luckily, I got this razor through a program run by Gillette Venus for free, otherwise I would be demanding my money back. I&#x27;ll stick with my Schick.</li>
    <li> I recently received a Venus &amp; Olay razor in Sugarberry from a program run by Gillette Venus. I loved the packaging, though it looks to target a younger group. The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was the smell. It smells amazing! Shaving with the razor was so simple without the need for shave cream. The only issue I have is that without shave cream I cannot tell as easily where I shaved already and I missed a few spots the first time around. Maybe I just need to be more focused when I shave in the shower. Also be sure to rinse well, it leaves a gel like feel (from the moisture strips) so be sure to rinse it off good. Overall I would definitely recommend this razor. The cartridges are easy to replace and also are interchangeable with other venus razors so you can basically use any cartridge you want to try from Venus with the handle. I cannot wait to try the Vanilla creme!</li>
    <li> Do you need a new razor? Are you sick and tired of using messy shaving cream and spending what seems like forever prepping for shaving?  I just tried the Gillete Venus &amp; Olay in sugarberry razor through a special program run by Gillette Venus! I absolutely LOVE it! There is absolutely no shaving cream needed and your legs feel silkier and softer than ever! I didn&#x27;t even need lotion. I loved the scent and the best part was the soft silky feeling doesn&#x27;t go away, even if you aren&#x27;t shaving your legs every day. What&#x27;s not to love? What are you waiting for? Go out and try it!</li>
    <li> This razor has quickly went from just a razor to a must have for me! I think it is essential for everyone, especially this summer. I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to a disposable razor ever again! I love how close of a shave I have after I use it, and without using an exfoliator! OMG, seriously in love. I will definitely be using this all summer!</li>
    <li> I was given this razor to try out by a program run by Gillette Venus. Additionally, I have a lot of experience with using the various razors that have come out in Venus line over the past several years, since I first started my shaving experience using Venus razors. I must say that I do love that this razor head does in fact require no shaving cream to achieve silky smooth legs, however the Olay moisture bar was dissolving rather quickly the while I was in the shower.  Given the rate the moisture bar was dissolving, I don&#x27;t think it would last me any more than 4 showers, which would mean that I would have to replace the entire razor head after such few uses. After getting out of the shower and drying off, my legs truly do feel amazing without applying any moisturizer. Personally, I also like to shave around my bikini area, and this particular razor head made it rather difficult given the shape to reach certain areas. Overall, if I were looking for a moisturizing razor solely for my legs, this would definitely be my go to. As an added bonus, the sugarberry scent smells delicious!</li>
    <li> The packaging was very appealing and who doesn&#x27;t love a pink razor? My legs are so silky smooth and I loved not having to use shave gel! Do be careful with the Olay bar though. When it&#x27;s wet, it&#x27;s like soap and can break easily. The 5 blades do what is promised. It only took one pass of the blades to completely remove the hair. Over all I absolutely love the product. It is so much better than the Shick Hydro I&#x27;ve been using. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> it was okay...i have used better razors...this one is overpriced so i only bought one and i dont plan on it again. the apple scent was nice though.</li>
    <li> I got the Venus &amp; Olay Sugarberry Scent Razor from a program run by Gillette. This razor was super disappointing. I was very excited about the moisture bars, because I love skipping as many steps as possible. However the moisture strips were not moisturizing at all! In fact they got really slimy very quickly, and kept \\&quot;gunking\\&quot; up the razor. I really should not have skipped using shaving cream because I got razor burn on my legs for the first time since middle school! I was surprised because I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all and I have used natural soaps or lotions to shave my legs when I was in a pitch with no consequences. The razor itself isn&#x27;t bad. I hope to dissolve the moisture bars and use it with shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the wall hanger though. Being able to hang my razor between uses is wonderful.</li>
    <li> THis Razor Is.Beyond Awesome! I Was Given This rAazor Through AFree Program By Venus GilletteThe Handle Fits Nicely IHand So Its Easy To Control, The 5Blades Are Sharp And Leave A Nice Close Smooth Shave, The Smell Is Nice Not Over Powering Or OldLady Ish, The Moisture Bars Rock, I Have Very Sensitive Skin That Most Razors Irritate, Would Defiantly But Replacement CartridgeS AndWould Recommend To Friends And damily</li>
    <li> Five razor blades get Venus close while gently exfoliating for surface skin renewal&lt;br /&gt;Olay Moisture Bars help lock in your skin&#x27;s moisture for less dryness&lt;br /&gt;Available in Vanilla Cr&amp;eacute;me and New Sugarberry scents&lt;br /&gt;No need for additional shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;SoftGrip® handle for confident control&lt;br /&gt;Shower hook to hang dry in between uses and easy storage&lt;br /&gt;Easy-to-change cartridges&lt;br /&gt;not badly  priced! you dont know what your missing till you try it</li>
    <li> I was able to try out this razor through a program run by Gillette. This razor is one of the best I have ever used and has quickly become my top rated. The five blades provide such a close shave and the number of days I go between shaving are greatly increased. The scent of SugarBerry smells so delicious and make my legs smell lovely. It was easy to use and I had no trouble. The best part about this razor is you do not have to use shaving cream - just use a cup of water to moisten the bars and then throughout the shaving process. This makes the shaving process a lot less messier which I love! The only con I have about this razor is the packaging it comes in. You open it from the back with the provided perforated plastic, but it was a bit difficult to open and quite sharp! So be careful when opening it. That&#x27;s the only downside about this razor. Other than that, I highly recommend it and will be purchasing it in the future.</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a program run my Gillette Venus and was very excited to try it. Other razors that I use always end up nicking my legs and they are so messy with shaving cream.  With the Venus and Olay razor, the soap bar attached to the razor allowed it to glide smoothly over my legs. It hardly felt like I was shaving! When I felt my legs, they were smooth and the razor did a great job on my legs as well as my under arms. I would definitely use this product again. I felt like I didn&#x27;t even have to lotion my legs after I showered because of how smooth they were. Even the suction cup holder works well and stays in the shower.</li>
    <li> After receiving this product for free from Gillette Venus, I was able to use it this morning. I loved the fact that it had 5 blades which meant I didn&#x27;t have to keep shaving over the same area and the hair was all gone in one pass. It also felt great in the hand. However, I was disappointed with how the product was meant to be claimed to do. For me, I could feel the blades on my skin and I felt like it would cut me. So, the olay bar didn&#x27;t really work for me, I felt like I needed shave cream. Also, the olay bar did help with moisture while I was shaving but when I was done, my legs felt dry. I also thought the product would help to reduce itching and irritation and it didn&#x27;t for me. I will start buying the razors to use for now on, but without the olay bar.</li>
    <li> I love the look of this razor and the fact that the shower hanger came with it. The razor worked so well for me that I didn&#x27;t even have to go over any spot twice or more like I have to with other razors. I didn&#x27;t get any cuts either. The olay moisture bars are a nice touch too, I didn&#x27;t even have to put lotion on afterward. I will definately be using this kind or razor from now on.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT! I received my razor free by a program by Gillete Venus and I am so happy I was able to use it! It is literally the smoothest shave I have ever gotten on my legs. The 5 blades wore wonders and the moisture bars made my legs incredibly soft and smooth. The best part about it is that I didn&#x27;t even have to use shaving cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is grips on the side of the handle that allows even wet hands to hold onto it. The moisture bars also had an amazing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was definitely able to tell that this razor not only is for shaving, but to also take care of your skin. Olay and Gillete are a match made in heaven!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely buying more razor blades to use it again. This razor is so worth every penny. By far the best razor I ever used!!!</li>
    <li> I got this razor via a program through GilletteVenus and I love it! The package was fairly easy to open which was a plus. It had a very nice scent to it, nothing too strong, but soft and pleasurable. The Olay soap on the razor was amazing. The moisturizer left my skin feeling silky smooth and the grip on the razor was just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;When I had first started using the Venus &amp; Olay Razor, it felt like I wasn&#x27;t shaving at all! The razor is so smooth and gentle and I think everyone would enjoy and appreciate that! I have very sensitive and dry skin as well, and I also have an issue with razor burn. Because the razor is so smooth and gentle on my skin I havent had those problems and I didn&#x27;t even need to put any pressure on my legs with the razor at all. It already gives a very smooth close shave. The package also comes with a very convenient little holder for the shower as well.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product! Especially if you have dry, sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I love the product!</li>
    <li> I was able to try the Venus &amp; Olay Razor through a program run by Gillette Venus, and absolutely loved it! The moisture bars provide the perfect balance between moisture + exfoliation. If you&#x27;re someone who likes to use additional shaving cream (like me) the moisture bars do not overpower it and your razor does not get clogged. I personally loved the smell-reminded me of baby shampoo, which is always a good thing. I love it. Try it.</li>
    <li> I loved this razor! The last one I tried had a moisturizing serum in it that was too slimy, but this one was perfectly smooth and silky, plus the smell is awesome!!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Venus &amp;Olay razor through a program run by Gillette Venus, when I received my razor in the mail I immediately opened it, I had been looking at this product in the store and I was so excited to try it out.  I live in a dry climate,which makes my skin really dry, especially when shaving! This razor was awesome, it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin and I didn&#x27;t even need lotion afterwards! Thanks Gillette Venus &amp; Olay :) I&#x27;m one happy girl thanks to your razor!!!</li>
    <li> I received the Venus and Olay razor through a program ran by Gillette Venus. Initially, I was skeptical of using a razor that didn&#x27;t require shaving cream but I was pleasantly surprised by the results. I found that it provided a very clean and close shave to my legs but was slightly less effective on my under arms. I also found that towards the end of my shave the Olay bars became slightly slimely. Overall, I would suggest this razor to anyone looking for a quick, smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I joined a program run by Gillette Venus to try the Venus &amp; Olay razor.  Overall I was mostly pleased with the razor. Gave me very smooth legs and was easy to use.  With my old razor I always had to apply lotion after due to itching legs and with the Olay addition, I was hoping I wouldn&#x27;t have it anymore.  However, that is not the case.  Overall, I recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I was leery about using a razor with a built in soap bar, as in the past I didn&#x27;t have very good experience with. After I used the Venus &amp; Olay razor, I was very impressed! It left my skin feeling super smooth and I didn&#x27;t get any nicks or cuts. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I received the razor via a program run by Gillette Venus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the razor! I used it for the first time yesterday, and my legs were smooth after use. Today, I did not use the razor. I took a bath, went out with some friends, and did a 6 mile run. I am now in the bed writing this review (yes i took a bath lol) and I rubbing my legs together and they are silky smooth! The little soap bars on the razor, whatever they are, do moisturize the skin while the razor snatches away all the hair from the targeted area. I cannot tell you how many times I would have to go over the same area to remove my armpit hair with my other razors. I only had to go over twice with the Venus &amp; Olay. One thing that I do not like, and it bothers me alot, is that there is no cap to put on the razor after you are finished. I assume since they provide you with a suction cup holder to put the razor on you do not need the cap. However the suction cup did not have enough suction, my razor kept falling and falling. So I don&#x27;t like that about the product. Would I buy this product with my own money in the future? Yes. Would I recommend it to others? Yes, just get yourself some caps to put on it since it doesn&#x27;t come with any ^_^</li>
    <li> I received the razor through a program run by Gillette Venus. The first thing I noticed was the great smell of the berry soap bar! I love the 5 blades! They give such a close shave, and it&#x27;s so convenient to not have to use shaving cream! My legs have never been smoother. I love the Olay lotion within the soap  bar. I recommend using the Olay body lotion after shaving to lock in those silky smooth legs!  I literally have nothing bad to say about this razor. I will never buy another brand again.</li>
    <li> I received the razor through a Gillette trial program and at first this razor worked really well, but after the second use the Olay bars fell off. I&#x27;m positive I get a better shave using the original Venus</li>
    <li> I got this venus olay sugarberry razor from program run by Gillette Venus and it was pretty good here are the pros and cons&lt;br /&gt;pros&lt;br /&gt;-smells amazing&lt;br /&gt;-close shave&lt;br /&gt;- non irritating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons&lt;br /&gt;-the bars run out to fast if you have to shave everyday</li>
    <li> First off, I recieved this product via a program run by Gillette Venus. I have extremely dry legs, and I have a hard time finding razors that don&#x27;t irritate my skin. I love this product. I Will definitely buy this again. Moisturizes your skin and leaves it feeling great!</li>
    <li> I love this razor. It is very feminine by look and features but the amount of blades make it a good, strong razor! Love it !</li>
    <li> I usually stick to my same quatro 4 blade but this was a nice shave that i like. Some people think the moisture bars are bulky which they kinda are but i only use these for my legs and i think its perfect! I just use some body wash and this and every thing comes out clean shaven and cut free. It also give a nice smell which is always a plus. I do have to say it takes a couple swipes to get everything cause the bars have so much volume . I recieved this free to try out from gillette and give my honest opinion and look forward to purchasing in the future!</li>
    <li> This razor is great I love that you don&#x27;t need no shaving cream that saves money and time! But it just wasn&#x27;t for me it didn&#x27;t get the job done how I wanted it. It did leave my legs smooth it was light weight easy to use but not for me</li>
    <li> The razor that I received from a program that ran from Gillette Venus, was the best razor that I&#x27;ve tried yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Venus razors for years, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve tried yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Olay bars are amazing; you don&#x27;t need any messy shaving gel; get this baby wet and it glides those five blades effortlessly over your skin. Just be careful with it in the shower, it&#x27;s easy to lose control of it if the bars and your skin get too wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect on the legs and gave me what was without a doubt the best under-arm shave I&#x27;ve had in my life. The size of the Olay bars made it a little tricky to use in the bikini zone, but it is possible and very well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent was mild and pleasant, like a good lotion, but it doesn&#x27;t stick around on you past the shave. The softness from the bars, however, will keep your skin happy all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got to try this one for free from a program from Gillette Venus, but I&#x27;ll be buying it probably as long as they keep making it.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, you owe it to yourself to give this a try.</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing! I couldn&#x27;t be more happy. I normally have to scrub shave and lotion and I&#x27;m still prickly by the end of the day but with this razor I didn&#x27;t even have to exfoliate first! And I also didn&#x27;t even need to use lotion after! Not to mention that I shaved Monday morning and I wasn&#x27;t even prickly until Wednesday morning! I didn&#x27;t even think that was possible for me! It even cane with its own hook to store it on the shower wall! It smelled AMAZING and worked great and I&#x27;m definitely not going back to my old razor after trying this one. I would definitely recommend anyone to use this razor unless they&#x27;re looking for a bad shave or anything less that amazing. Haha this is really the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used and anyone would enjoy the moisturizing and the close shave that comes with using this razor.</li>
    <li> I just tried this razor thanks to a program run by gilette venus! This razor is so amazing, and is now my new favorite! The Venus &amp; Olay razor left my legs feeling so smooth with no stuble in sight! The sugarberry scent smells so good, and clean! The razor itself is very sturdy, and has five blades that get extremely close for a great close shave. I also love the fact that it has a shower hook which is really handy when it comes to storage. The packaging is a little bulky, but other then that this razor is worth purchasing and I give it 5 out of 5 Stars!</li>
    <li> This Razor was a match made in heaven for someone like me. It keeps my legs feeling silky smooth and I love the fact you don&#x27;t need to worry about applying shave gel. Its perfect for any girl on the road for travel or if your in a hurry and need a quick shave. The best part is how smooth your legs feel even if you skip the lotion. I was provided this razor via a program from Gillette venus but the opinions are strictly my own. I have no reason to lie. This razor truly is a great razor for any gal.</li>
    <li> I recently received this Venus &amp; Olay razor from a program Gillette Venus was doing, and OMG do I love it! I have no cons for it so far and I have used 4 times now. Here some of the pros&#x60;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice even shave with no nicks whatsoever, which is surprising considering how sharp the blades are and how big of a klutz I am!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice, really enjoyed that it lingered in the shower and that was it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suction cup for the shower is a nice, non bulky way to store the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleek design makes it nice to grip onto while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY moisturizing, definitely noticed a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, I lied, I can think of only one Con..I didn&#x27;t notice the \\&quot;exfoliating\\&quot; part of this razor. Moisturizing, they got it..exfoliating, not so much which unfortunately cost this awesome product a star :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall an amazing razor that I WILL be repurchasing over and over!</li>
    <li> I have been wondering whether to purchase the Venus &amp; Olay razor to see how it worked. I was provided with this razor via a program by Gillette Venus and I cannot thank them enough! It was an absolute pleasure to use this. Starting off with the packaging, it was very pretty. I think it&#x27;s very important for packaging to be pretty and well done because as a girl we usually steer towards the products that catch our eye, so Venus &amp; Olay well done for that! Once I opened the package and attached the razor head to the body it had a very nice scent. The sugarberry smelt like fruit candy and it definitely added to the experience. It was great not having to use shaving cream, just rinse the bars and start shaving. The razor glides on the skin, it almost feels like you&#x27;re not shaving at all. There&#x27;s 5 blades to assure you get the closest shave. The moisture bars were wonderful, you can really feel it moisturizing your legs leaving a silky touchable smooth surface. I also love the fact it came with a holder to put in your shower, very helpful for easy access.&lt;br /&gt;The downsides I have experienced with this product is that the moisture bars do dissolve very easily and shrink down in size. It is also not the best razor for the bikini area but it does work. And last but not least, the smell of the sugarberry may not be for everyone but personally I enjoyed it. Overall, this was a great product and I definitely will be purchasing it once I have used mine up!</li>
    <li> I am not impressed with the Venus and Olay razor...I love the idea of an Olay moisturizing bar to create smooth and silky skin, but the Olay bar does not last long enough to make up for the price of the razor. If you want to buy new blades every week to keep up the product the way it is intended to be used, then this may be for you- but I can purchase a more cost effective razor that lasts much longer. The moisturizing bar was gone within 1 week of use, which was a major disappointment. This product had a good idea, but failed to provide desirable outcomes as far as I am concerned. Also, I did receive the product for free in the mail to test and review, but overall I experienced a poor outcome.</li>
    <li> I was provided this razor as part of a program run by Gillette Venus. Here are my thoughts after trying it out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-leaves my legs incredibly soft&lt;br /&gt;-this razor just GLIDES over my legs!&lt;br /&gt;-smells great&lt;br /&gt;-no irritation or razor burn!&lt;br /&gt;-easy to use in the shower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-a little expensive for a razor, especially to replace every 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I love these razors for my legs. If I found them on sale, I&#x27;d definitely stock up!!</li>
    <li> I Love this product!! It left me with soft silky legs. I love the smell the sugarberry smells refreshing! The Venus &amp; Olay Razor I would defiantly recommend If you want soft silky legs!</li>
    <li> When I received the Venus &amp; Olay razor to test from a program run by Gillette Venus I had never seen such a unique razor. I love how the moisture bar is so large and is flexible with my body. I could hardly feel the razor while I was shaving I had to do a double take to see if it was even touching my skin, It shaves the hair the first time. It&#x27;s soooo smooth!! the moisture bar is like nothing I&#x27;ve used before, it leaves my skin soft. I also like that there is a holder to stick inside the shower for your Venus &amp; Olay razor for easy access.</li>
    <li> I recently received the opportunity to try the Venus &amp; Olay razor through a Gillette/ Venus program. I was immediately impressed with how silky my legs were after the shave, and how little time it took to shave! I absolutely love how much time this razor cut off of my normal shave routine. This razor is a must have for summer. I will say that while this razor does a tremendous job with silky smooth legs (my husband noticed a difference after the first shave!)it&#x27;s a little bulky to handle the bikini and underarm area well.&lt;br /&gt;This razor is a great product for women who have little time to spare for their morning routine.</li>
    <li> I got this razor from a program sponsored by Venus Gillette and decided to give it a try. I used it a couple time and notice it gave me a lot of ingrown hairs and razor bumps I typically use bic disposables because they give me a really close shave. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing this razor again.</li>
    <li> Never been so happy with a razor like I am with this one. Left my legs silky smooth. Not one stubble left behind. Best part is not needing shaving cream. Also it dries and all you need to do is wet and use again. Awesome razor! I received this razor via a program run by Gillette Venus.</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free as part of a program run by Gillette Venus and I&#x27;m so glad I did! I was a bit skeptical about shaving with NO shaving cream, but it worked so well and left my legs feelins so smooth. I can&#x27;t get over how much easier it is to shave this way without all the fuss of shaving cream, and it works just as well, if not better! I am really pleased with the Venus &amp; Olay razor.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I bought this so I went straight to shower afterwards to use it. I have very thick black hair so after I used it I notice that I still had hair left on my legs..it did not shave off all of my hair. I guess this razor works better on people with soft light hair not thick. But besides that is a great razor and leaves your skin smooth, of course more smooth if you have light hair lol.</li>
    <li> I have very dry legs and usually after I shave even with shaving cream they itch. I received this razor from a program by Gillette Venus and I shaved my legs with it but without shaving cream, and my legs felt very smooth and soft afterward and did not itch at all! The scent was fresh but subtle, I didn&#x27;t really notice it. One thing I didn&#x27;t like was that when you rinse the razor you&#x27;re also wasting some of the shave cream a bit but I guess there&#x27;s not much you can do to fix that. Over all great close shave as always from Venus.</li>
    <li> This razor is the best! I was so excited when i received the Gillette Venus and Olay Razor for FREE via a program run by Gillette. Not only does it smell great but, it is so smooth. With the Olay soap bar at the end you don&#x27;t have to add messy shaving cream, just pick up and go! Slides gently across your legs creating a close, lasting shave. Venus &amp; Olay made a great team together and really help get the job done!</li>
    <li> I recently received the razor through a program run by Gillette Venus. While I was overall happy with the shave it provided, the moisturizing strips ran out very quickly. It would cost too much to replace the blades as often as needed.</li>
    <li> The moisture strip and the five blade razor definitely get the job done on this razor.  So glad that I was able to try the product for free by a program through Gillette Venus!!  Definitely getting replacement blades!  My only complaint would be that it is quite a bit bulky and that made it a little more difficult to shave around curvy or bony areas.</li>
    <li> The new Venus &amp; Olay Razor arrived in my mailbox a few weeks ago in a nondescript yellow envelope that belied the gloriously holographic packaging inside, courtesy of Gillette Venus. The first thing I noticed was the great scent (\\&quot;Sugarberry\\&quot;) - light and sweet, but not overwhelmingly sugar. I also liked that it wasn&#x27;t one of those thick, heavy scents - I hate when I use a new shaving cream and end up broadcasting the fact that I&#x27;d shaved with a preceding cloud of scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olfactorily satisfied, I hung up the razor in its little suction cup-ed holder in my shower (taking immense satisfaction in its ability to actually hold the razor without losing its grip on the tiled shower wall) to await shaving time later. By the time shower time rolled around I was beyond excited to try out my new razor...even though I only had about 0.25 centimeters of growth (an extremely generous estimate). Truthfully I had shaved only two days before, so I knew that if I shaved again it would be less \\&quot;shaving\\&quot; and more \\&quot;spot treating.\\&quot; Alas, the clarion call of the Venus &amp; Olay razor was too difficult to resist, so spot treating be damned! - I went ahead and started shaving. I was immediately impressed by how the water from the shower transformed the solid shaving cream attached to the razor into an almost slimy, intensely moisturizing, shaving gel. The razor glided over my skin, leaving no cuts or nicks on my bare skin while effectively and brutally eliminating all the &#x27;lone rangers.&#x27; The remaining shave gel rinsed off naturally over the course of the shower without any extra rinsing or toweling, and also wasn&#x27;t excessively foamy, which I liked. The last time I tried one those thicker, super foamy (and so I thought, extra moisturizing) shave creams, I had to hose down the tub after every shave - a particularly galling annoyance when you&#x27;re already running late for work. It was almost like shaving with moisturizing serum, which I will admit I have done in a pinch. I particularly liked how instead of surrounding the entire razor with the solid shave cream, the Venus &amp; Olay razor has two strips of the shave cream on the top and bottom of the razor blades, which are attached to a head that has some freedom of movement so it glides over the contours of your legs (or armpits, or whatever) for a close shave that doesn&#x27;t require doing yoga poses in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days later, when the stubble had well and truly started growing, I gave the Venus &amp; Olay razor its second run - and like the first time around, it met all my expectations. I will say that there were a few spots where it missed a few hairs (mainly on the backs of my calves) but that&#x27;s probably due more to my laziness/traditionally kind of laissez-faire attitude towards that area (who really looks at the backs of calves, anyway?!) than any real defect on the razor&#x27;s part. And just like last time, my legs stayed well moisturized after the shower - so much so that I didn&#x27;t even bother putting on lotion, an added bonus that shaved a full five minutes off my post-shower ritual. Win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this razor to everyone - it&#x27;s one of those one-stop-shopping items that will not only make your life easier but simultaneously free up quite a bit of cupboard space as you stop buying shaving cream, lotion, other razors...AND, you can even store the thing on your shower wall. No more razors lying around listlessly on the edge of the tub for this apartment!ked how instead of surrounding the entire razor with the solid shave cream, the Venus &amp; Olay razor has two strips of the shave cream on the top and bottom of the razor blades, which are attached to a head that has some freedom of movement so it glides over the contours of your legs (or armpits, or whatever) for a close shave that doesn&#x27;t require doing yoga poses in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days later, when the stubble had well and truly started growing, I gave the Venus &amp; Olay razor its second run - and like the first time around, it met all my expectations.

    <li> My Venus &amp; Olay Razor was provided for me via a program run by Gillette Venus. Overall, I thought that it was a great razor! I didn&#x27;t have to worry about the hassle of using shaving cream, and my skin ended up smoother thanks to the Olay strips around the razor. The only downside seemed to be that the Olay strips wore away quicker than I would have liked, and once the Olay strips began to wear away I had to incorporate shaving cream again.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time user of Schick razors and have never had any complaints. I decided to give this Gilette razor a try and was not in love. It does give a close shave but the moisturizing bar almost makes the shave to slick. I managed to cut myself on each leg. I don&#x27;t care for the scent although it&#x27;s not bad. I feel like this would need to be replaced often to ensure there was enough moisturizing bar still along the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Close shave, but too many factors that I did not love for me to purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to be a part of the program by Gillette and Venus to test out the Venus &amp; Olay Razor! Upon receiving my package in the mail I opened it with haste and was delightfully surprised by how easy the razor packaging was to open. I have not bought a Venus product in years so I don&#x27;t know if the perforated plastic comes standard but it is a handy feature! The sugarberry scent is so refreshing and delightful! When I first used the Venus &amp; Olay Razor the moisturizing bars didn&#x27;t get wet enough to show any action till I got to my second leg, but I figured there wasn&#x27;t enough water on the bars at first. When I got out of the shower my legs were silky smooth and I opted to pass on using lotion afterwards in order to test the \\&quot;after shower effects\\&quot; of the moisturizing bars and I went the whole day lotion free. I was not impressed. If anything my legs seemed more dry than normal. I did a few more lotion free tests and got the same results. I also didn&#x27;t like how bulky the razor was. Clearly the size cannot be helped but I didn&#x27;t feel like it handled very well in um.. \\&quot;tight corners.\\&quot; I was impressed with the five blades, the exfoliating factor, and the close shave I got on my legs and under arms. The Venus and Olay Razor has a more gentle feel to shaving than I&#x27;ve ever experienced</li>
    <li> I had a coupon for this item, so I figured, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is really nice if you like something a little more springy and sweet, which I do. The handle for the razor is probably the most comfortable one I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of razors on the market, mostly because I had very sensitive skin. I either get razor burn easily, nick terribly, my skin dries out, etc... After seeing rave reviews for this, I was eager to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I won&#x27;t use it again. I didn&#x27;t get a close shave at all; my legs are still fuzzy and I can already feel a dry/burning feeling on my skin, despite it being less than five minutes since I finished shaving. The soap bars hardly lathered up for me, and even when it seemed like they were, the actual razor was still painful in spots. I didn&#x27;t notice much of an exfoliating feeling, so I was a little disappointed there, because that seemed unique. Besides the scent and comfortable handle, it&#x27;s hard to say good things. The actual razors aren&#x27;t anything special, and I get a closer shave from my usual razor. The suction cup holder probably only works on tiled bathroom walls, which I do not have, so that part is useless to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin, be wary. I have to go re-shave my legs because this one did such a poor job. I had high hopes for this, but like others have said, it&#x27;s nothing special and has lots of room for improvement.</li>
    <li> The razor I got was provided via a program run by Gillette Venus.&lt;br /&gt;I like the look of the packaging, although as another reviewer mentioned it is a bit excessive. The lotion bars are very soft and chip easily. When using the razor, the lotion was amazing. I did not need shaving cream and my legs were pretty smooth after. However, the size of the lotion bars made the razor difficult to maneuver sometimes. I was not able to reach everywhere with the razor. This is a good razor, with some drawbacks.</li>
    <li> I received my Venus &amp; Olay(tm) Razor from a program run by Gillette Venus and I was a bit skeptical at first but after one use they have me hooked! The first thing I loved was the new easy open packaging! I don&#x27;t know about anyone else but every time I buy a new razor, I leave in the bathroom until I&#x27;m about to use it and when I finally go to grab it in the shower I have to get out an find some scissors to get it open! That is not the case with the Venus &amp; Olay(tm) Razor packaging! The second thing I love is that the amount of blades it has gives me a close shave after the first swipe! This was the first razor I&#x27;ve had where I didn&#x27;t have to re-shave parts of my leg that the razor had initially missed! Add that to the fact that I don&#x27;t need to use any shave gel and the Venus &amp; Olay(tm) Razor has easily shaved 10 minutes off of my shower routine!</li>
    <li> I have always been looking for the perfect razor ad my razor has stopped I fell in love with my razor love how it leaves my leg soft and shiny!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the Venus &amp; Olay- Sugarberry razor. I received the razor through a program run by Gillette Venus, and didn&#x27;t think it would be any different than my current razor that I&#x27;ve had for quite some time. However, I found the razor to give me a much closer, smoother shave than I anticipated. I used to have to shave daily, and now I can go every other day. Another thing that may seem small, but really made an impact was the comfortable handle. The grip was soft and comfortable to hold, just making the experience that much better. Sometimes my current razor slips in my fingers causing cuts, but I&#x27;m not having problems with this new razor. GREAT product, and I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I received Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Razor free from a program run by Gillette and I absolutely love how the Venus &amp; Olay Razor is packaged; it&#x27;s so easy to open with a semi detached seam at the back of the packaging. The previous packaging for Venus razors had to be open with some sort of sharp object which was kind of a hassle. I really do not see any difference from the Venus Spa Breeze. Both styles have some sort of moisturizing gel above and below the blades that eliminates the need for shaving cream. The lotion strip is a nice touch and des leave legs feeling smooth and soft but when the razor is left in the shower on the awesome shower hook included in the packaging, after a while the lotion strip starts getting all gooey. I assume from the steam of the shower then the texture of the lotion strip isn&#x27;t very pleasant as the first use. That is probably my only complaint for the Venus &amp; Olay(tm) Razor. On the bright side, the razor is great for vacation or traveling that way there is no need to pack shaving cream. I prefer to use the Venus &amp; Olay(tm) Razor for travel and the Venus Embrace for every day use.</li>
    <li> I received the Venus &amp; Olay Razor in Sugarberry for FREE provided via a program run by Gillette Venus.&lt;br /&gt;My first thoughts of this product was that the packaging was adorable! It is sparkly and brightly colored, which I loved. In opening the packaging I immediately could smell the Sugarberry scent, which I think was a nice scent. Something a little different from the usual scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first use of this razor was on my legs. I loved that I did not need to use shaving cream! It really saves time. I also liked how it made a coating/slime on my legs that kept them feeling smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A huge pro to this product was that it did NOT give me razor burn! That is a big deal for me because just about every product I&#x27;ve tried has given me razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A huge con to this product is that the Olay bars fall apart very easily. After ONE use on my legs the bars were reduced to about half of the size they were initially, and they had bits and pieces falling off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would not recommend this product due to the fact that the Olay bars are so fragile.I would guess that you could get 3-4 uses out of each cartridge, and to me that&#x27;s just not enough use considering the price.</li>
    <li> I received my Venus &amp; Olay Razor via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;Since the moment I opened my package there was not a quality about I didn&#x27;t love. The packaging is very appealing and super girly. The moisturizer bar and smell are exceptional. The scent is good, and the moisture I received during my shave was incredible. It saved me from the after shower lotion and the bumpy rash filled legs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to always use my husbands razors because I felt that men had the \\&quot;better quality\\&quot; products, but Gillette proved me wrong with the Venus &amp; Olay Razor, I was overly impressed and will for sure be purchasing in the future!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Venus razors and when I tried Venus and Olay in Sugarberry I wasn&#x27;t disappointed! Such a close shave with five blades. The moisture bars smell awesome and glide over my skin like butter. My legs are soft and hairless. Venus makes shaving less of a chore. I&#x27;m feeling like a goddess. I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I just tried this razor tonight, and it worked wonders on my legs!! It left them so smooth I thought it must have been a miracle!! It also smells very fruity!!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this razor to anyone who loves getting every hair, not just a really close shave!! You have to buy it and try it to see for yourself that it gives an amazing razor experience!!</li>
    <li> I received the Venus &amp; Olay Razor through a program run by Gillete Venus in the mail the other day, and I finally got to try it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I loved about it was the bright packaging, I admit I&#x27;m a sucker for bright things! When I opened it up, I loved that it came with a suction cup holder for your shower or bath wall. I don&#x27;t have many places where I could put my razor, so this was amazing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened it up to smell the sugar berry scent, I was a little scared because I usually don&#x27;t do well with scented razors and cream. This scent was so nice and subtle, not overly sweet or overpowering. I was falling in love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided I had to rush to use it, so I got in the bath and went to town. The great thing is that you don&#x27;t need to use shaving cream because of the moisturizing bars attached above and below the razor. It&#x27;s so convenient to just shave where you have to without having to worry about shaving cream. Also it has FIVE blades. FIVE. I think this was the closest shave I have ever gotten. My legs have never felt so silky or smooth before. I did have to moisturize a little bit more since the 5 blades are so exfoliating, but I always moisturize anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I loved this product. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing refills when it runs out.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis and it has been hard to find a good razor that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and make me break out. This razor was good and I sort of liked it but I wouldn&#x27;t use it again. My mother bought one and she liked it and said that&#x27;s all she would use. If it wasn&#x27;t for my skin, I&#x27;d use it again but I can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive so I was pretty hesitant when trying this razor. I fell in love with it. Makes my legs smooth and does not irritate them. It also saves me time with the moisturizing bars, so I don&#x27;t have to lather up my legs with shaving cream. It also has a GREAT smell. I loved how it came with a thing to hang the razor on the wall. I would recommend this razor to anybody!</li>
    <li> The Gillett Venus-Olay Razor in Sugarberry is a razor with an intriguing smell. The razor was provided by Gillette Venus program or otherwise I may have not tried it. The razor provided a close shave without the razor burn. The Sugarberry berry bars moisturized your legs as you shaved and the smell was not over powering. The bars actually stayed on the razor and were evenly distributed throughout the shaving process. I loved the small shower clip that hangs in the shower and it held the razor well.  I would recommend the Gillett Venus-Olay razor; I really enjoyed the experience of this razor.</li>
    <li> I recently was provided the Venus &amp; Olay Razor in Sugarberry  from a program run by Gillette Venus. Admittedly, I was a bit skeptical at first. But can you blame me? Razors promise a bunch of things, but somehow never seem to deliver on EVERYTHING, but I&#x27;d say that the Venus &amp; Olay Razor follows through. First off, let&#x27;s talk about the handle. Oftentimes other razors will place (namely where your finger will rest) and that&#x27;s it. For me, this tends to result in a slippery accident and plenty of nicks. The Venus &amp; Olay handle is 100 percent COVERED in soft rubber and has a perfectly placed notch to put your finger. I was able to firmly grip the handle and didn&#x27;t have any worries about it slipping from my hands. Onto the head and actual razor. The razor head contains 5 blades and Olay Moisture Bars on each side of the blades. It smells fantastic-fruity, but clean. One thing the bothers me about razors is that they tell you the the head pivots to make shaving easier, and yet the thing barely moves. I happen to have difficulty shaving my knees and often cut myself because the head does not move the way I need it to. The Venus &amp; Olay razor, however, has an extremely flexible head, allowing me to shave my knees without fear of nicks. Now, each of these promises to do something special for you. The 5 blade technology is supposed to provide a close shave and is meant to exfoliate your skin, while the Olay Moisture Bars act as your shaving cream as well as a long lasting moisturizer.This is a definite must for me, because that means I don&#x27;t have to buy messy shaving cream that will get everywhere and wash off before I can actually shave! When I&#x27;m buying a new razor, I always look for 5 blades. The more thinner and finer blades, the closer and longer lasting the shave-well, at least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned in my own experience, so the fact the this razor has 5 blades that promise to exfoliate your skin too? It&#x27;s great! I was worried that the Moisture Bars would prevent me from getting close to my skin to ensure a really smooth shave, and was surprised when they didn&#x27;t. My legs were smooth, and a part from a few stubbly patches, the razor gave me a very close shave, and my legs are still smooth, despite using it 3 days ago and there were absolutely no nicks! The collaboration between Gillette Venus and Olay is pure brilliance. For the summer time, I&#x27;m looking for silky smooth legs, and this alliance gives me just what I need.m getting close to my skin to ensure a really smooth shave, and was surprised when they didn&#x27;t.

    <li> I received the Venus &amp; Olay Razor in Sugarberry for FREE provided via a program run by Gillette Venus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first thoughts of this product was that the packaging was a little bulky compared to many other razors. In opening the packaging I immediately could smell the Sugarberry scent, which I think was a nice scent. Something a little different from the usual scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I liked the close shave and protection of the bar.  I have MS and it can be difficult to shave but this worked nicely.  I also loved that I didn&#x27;t need to use shaving cream, which could save a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The bar seemed fragile and would probably break after a few uses.  Also it seems like it would be a pretty pricey item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would probably pick other razors and shaving cream over this razor.</li>
    <li> I was provided one of these razors to try &amp; review via a program run by Gillette Venus. It smells like sweet fruit berries, I loved that it has 5 blades and that you don&#x27;t need shaving cream to shave with it. It made my legs nice &amp; smooth &amp; not dry at all. It also shaved my bikini area better than any other razor I&#x27;ve used, which was a big surprise considering I didn&#x27;t have to use any shaving cream! Love this razor. Definitely would recommend to a friend who is looking to shave their bikini line without any razor burn or bumps.</li>
    <li> I really love this razor! It truly gave me the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and I loved not having to mess with shaving cream in the process. The sugarberry scent is amazing!</li>
    <li> This razor worked pretty well, it left my legs nice and silky, and smelled really good to me.&lt;br /&gt;But, I find that the shower hook, like most now a days, doesn&#x27;t really work well. Mine stuck for a few days and then fell off. Also, I think that they could really improve on the lasting power of the shave bars. I find with any razor that has them, they don&#x27;t last that long, and can get gummy after a few uses, and this one was no exception. I really wish venus would come out with ones that didn&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product for free.</li>
    <li> I have tried 2 razors for women before, and they were both just average. After trying the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Razor by a program run by Gillette Venus, I can now say 3/3 razors I have tried are about the same. I personally can never get a women&#x27;s razor to cut so close to my skin as to eliminate all stubble! Although this razor was nothing special for me, there are still some advantages and disadvantages that it has in comparison to other razors out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantages&lt;br /&gt;-Shower hook was included. I found this very convenient, and it stuck well onto my shower and the razor fit well without falling.&lt;br /&gt;-Razor itself was small and thin. (easy for traveling)&lt;br /&gt;-Razor head was very flexible&lt;br /&gt;-I actually liked the slimy consistency of the soap. The consistency made it moisturizing and you really didn&#x27;t have to use shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantages&lt;br /&gt;-I didn&#x27;t get the close shave I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;-Legs were not smooth and silky :(&lt;br /&gt;-Scent was too light&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the razor had many advantages especially when compared to the two that I have previously used, but it just didn&#x27;t work on my legs :(</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try this razor through a program run by Venus, and will be hitting the store to buy when it runs out!&lt;br /&gt;From the moment you open the cartridge, you can smell the amazing sweet sugarberry scent - LOVE!!  I&#x27;ve never gotten a closer shave with any other shave cream I&#x27;ve tried, thank you 5blades and moisture bars! Plus, no dry skin right after hopping out of the shower!!!&lt;br /&gt;My only concern, is the build up from the bars dulling the blades quicker than usual, but time will tell!&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely would recommend you give this a shot!</li>
    <li> I know, I got you at \\&quot;smells good\\&quot; right? When I saw \\&quot;New Sugarberry Scent\\&quot; on the front of the package for the Gillette Venus + Olay razor I was like, \\&quot;Why does my razor need to smell good?\\&quot; After a long, hard workout though, I was incredibly stinky. I got in the shower and started washing my hair, then started to shave my underarms. Instantly I noticed how good they smelled before I had even scrubbed them! I could also tell instantly how soft they were without having to use any shaving cream. Pretty incredible. Even after the shower, hours later, they are still soft and I have no red bumps, something I do often battle. I will say the same about my legs, shaved them with no shaving cream, I didn&#x27;t miss a spot, that was probably my expertise, but my legs are indeed silky smooth. My only concern is how long the moisture bars will last. They didn&#x27;t seem to be deteriorating much after the first use but I can&#x27;t help but wonder.</li>
    <li> I was provided one of these razors to try &amp; review via a program run by Gillette Venus. I love the smell, sweet fruit berries. I also loved that it has 5 blades and that you don&#x27;t need shaving cream to shave with it. It made my legs nice &amp; smooth &amp; not dry at all. I will definitely be recommending this to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product.  I got it as a promotion that a company was doing.  However, I would definitely spend my money on it.  The smell is really good.  The shave is very close and smoothe.  The smoothness lasts for a long time.  I am a die hard BIC razor buyer but I&#x27;m converted to this now.  It has all of the features one would want; smoothe shave, lots of blades for comfort, moisture strips, and a great scent.  Love this razor!</li>
    <li> I am thoroughly impressed with the Venus and Olay razor in sugarberry. I got to try it for free thanks to a program by Gillette Venus which always makes it worth a try. First off, it smells super delicious.  More importantly however is the quality of how well this product works.  I am a single mother of a 3 year old so I don&#x27;t usually get to ever shave both legs at the same time. The 5 blades along with not having to mess with shaving cream saves me so much time that i don&#x27;t have to pick what gets done today--I can do it all! I also have severely dry skin that easily gets irritated by shaving.  I&#x27;m not going to pretend that this razor totally fixed that for me but it has made a huge improvement! I just keep touching my legs, they just feel so soft, and look it too which is new for me!  As far as shaving legs and armpits, this razor is perfect!! Easy, Fast, Smells good, lasting lovely legs, and quality blades.  The only thing I would have to admit isn&#x27;t convenient about it is that is a little difficult to shave the little spots in your bikini area with the head being bigger with the Olay strips. It is definitely worth having a smaller razor on the side of this one though-I don&#x27;t plan on giving up on this one anytime soon with how pretty it makes me feel!</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing. Makes legs super soft and silky, it smells good too! It gets the job done easily.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette razor via a program run by Gillette Venus. I liked it for the first two times, than the soap around the razor is gone. The blades last a good bit but had to than use other soap so I wouldn&#x27;t get nicked.</li>
    <li> This razor is super easy to use and cuts down on time it takes to shave thanks to its built in bars that lather for you... but that&#x27;s also its downfall. For some reason (perhaps intentional), I noticed after shaving that my skin was beyond smooth... it was slimy. The soap/moisturizer could be re-formulated to not be like this and it would be perfect. I would just prefer not to have to spend extra time rinsing the slime off my legs/underarm area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided my razor to test via a program run by Gillette Venus.&lt;br /&gt;All above opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think the extra blade made a world of difference in the shave quality. In fact, I don&#x27;t think the shave was as close as it needed to be and I was unusually spiky within hours. I did really like the Olay addition though. It made for a very quick and smooth shave without any soap or shaving cream. Also, it was very gentle on my sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t leave me with dry skin or bumps. If the shave were just a little bit closer, I would have been sold. The good news is that I received the for free via a program run by Gillette Venus! I don&#x27;t think I would have bought it if it hadn&#x27;t been otherwise though</li>
    <li> I acquired this product free from a program run by Gillette Venus, but I plan to make it a part of my routine. No shaving cream is required, the five blades cut very close to the skin and leave no sign of hair, and the moisture bars keep skin silky and soft after shaving - no lotion application afterwords! I usually expect new razors to nick my skin around the knee area, but the bars on this one kept that from being an issue.</li>
    <li> My first thought when I saw the new Venus razor was that the moisture bars would fall off or get damaged too soon, but 3 shaves later and they are still intact. They work very well with the five blades, keeping my legs very very smooth. I thought the Schick Intuition was really cool when it came out, but the moisture bar around the whole razor was too much. This, is perfect. The only bad thing I could say is that it didn&#x27;t have a strong scent. I&#x27;ve never tried any &#x27;Sugarberry&#x27; scents before, but it didn&#x27;t really smell like anything. I was given the opportunity to try this new product through a program run by Gillette Venus and am happy to say I love it and will certainly be buying refills! (once they try a new scent. :P)</li>
    <li> I got this product from a program ran by Gillette Venus and I&#x27;m really glad I had the opportunity to use this product and share my thoughts. I really liked the Venus &amp; Olay Razor the first few times I used it. I really liked how smooth it was gliding along my legs and how soft my legs felt. I also really liked that the razor came with a holder and  suction cup for easy access in the shower. This razor was probably the best razor I have used in a really long time. The ONLY thing I did not like about the product is that there is soap along side the blades and when you take the razor away from your skin there is this slimy little string. You can just wipe it off or whatever. The only problem I had with this product was very minor. Overall, I really like this product.</li>
    <li> I received my Venus &amp; Olay Razor in Sugarberry from a program being run by Gillette Venus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having heard so many great things about Venus razors I was eager to try them myself. Built-in shaving gel could only be a plus! Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN SHORT:&lt;br /&gt;The razor shaves close and well. I like! The moisture bars are bulky and annoying around my bikini line, but they work great as a shaving gel and as a moisturizer. Overall it&#x27;s just an OK razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want all the dirty details?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-It shaves close and smooth. What more can you ask for from a razor?&lt;br /&gt;-Built-in shaving gel does a great job with coverage so there really is no need for more soap or cream. The gel pad at the bottom makes sure to distribute a liberal amount before the razor blades follow.&lt;br /&gt;-The Olay Moisture Bars actually did help a LOT with my abysmally dry and flaky legs.&lt;br /&gt;-As one with beyond sensitive skin I 100% expected this razor to make me burn and itch. It didn&#x27;t. Pleasant surprise!&lt;br /&gt;-The handle is the standard Venus one, so any of their other cartridges will work with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-BULK. This razor head is giant which makes getting into close quarters (underarms, bikini line) a major hassle.&lt;br /&gt;-You have to use some pressure to get the actual blades to touch your skin due to the clunky moisture bars. This creates some serious concern for cuts because...&lt;br /&gt;-The Olay Moisture Bars, while very effective, are also extremely slimy. Apply pressure on a slippery surface with sharp blades and see what will inevitably happen :(&lt;br /&gt;-I fear those Moisture Bars won&#x27;t last very long. Rinsing out the hair from the blades exposes these bars to a lot more water than I believe they were designed for.&lt;br /&gt;-Minor con: The suction cup for the razor&#x27;s hook does not work on my shower tiles, nor on the window.</li>
    <li> I love the Gillette Venus and Olay razor! I was able to try the product through a program and it was amazing! My legs were smooth and I loved the smell of the razor! Great product!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> receive this item to Review through a program ran by Gillette Venus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package that it came in was cute, but it was pretty big. It had a suction holder, a handle, and one cartridge. I was happy the handle had the gel grip because I am clumsy and would sometimes drop the razor. The cartridge actually smells really good and there are Olay bars on either side of the razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am more of a waxer type of girl because I do not get a close enough shave with the razor. Since I receive this to review I shaved. I did not use any soap before using the razor, which was  a little bad because I am experiencing a small razor burn. Next time I use it I will. However, you would not need to use alot of soap. The shave was smooth and was close. I let my bf touch my legs and he was amazed how smooth they were. It was a good shave for your armpits as well. When I shaved under my arms it was quick and clean. This would save people time and money from buying and applying shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on how long the bars last will determine if I would buy the refills.</li>
    <li> I received this razor today through a program run by Gillette Venus,first off when i opened the Venus &amp; Olay package the first thing i loved was the smell of the moisture bars,and also that it was in my favorite color .The Venus &amp; Olay Razor left my skin silky soft,the shaving process was very moisturizing and i actually did not feel like i was shaving,i had to look to see if the hair was truly being removed.I absolutely love the fact that this razor came with moisture bars and just really made the shaving process a breeze.I also love the grip of the razor,it was very soft and no slips.Overall i love this razor and plan to use  it all the time.I am quite satisfied with this product because i did not have to worry about getting cuts on my skin,in the past the razors i used cannot be compared to the Venus &amp; Olay Razor,i have to say i am a happy customer.</li>
    <li> The new Venus &amp; Olay scent is DELECTABLE! The Strawberry scent can be smelled from half a mile away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this delectable razor through a program run by Gillette Venus! I really appreciate the large width of the top and bottom moisturizing strip on the razor. It removes the need to use shaving cream or replace moisture with a conditioning body wash. The Venus &amp; Olay razor actually make the shaving process ENJOYABLE! This is a nearly impossible feat, but thank god they invented this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only disadvantage I had was that the suction cup on the back of the razor is not strong or adhesive, but other than that, A ++</li>
    <li> I recently tried the Venus &amp; Olay Razor through a program run by Gillette Venus and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the pretty pink packet, I was surprised that it came with its very own shower hanger! I can just stick it on my shower wall and it&#x27;s easily available when I need it. The next thing I noticed was that the razor is reusable so I can just buy another cartridege when I&#x27;ve used up this one. It had side grips so it&#x27;s easy to grab even when wet. The last thing I noticed was the amazing scent the bar had. The Sugarberry scent lingered on my skin even after I got out the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hooked the razor up, moistened it and it glided right on my leg (no shaving cream needed!) and caught every hair with one passing. My legs felt so smooth and moisturized when I stepped out the shower! I could&#x27;ve just put on shorts and left my house without adding lotion. Definitely, the best razor I have tried thus far.</li>
    <li> I received this razor with a program run by Gillette Venus. I thought this razor was going to be great because of the hype. However, I found it to be like every other razor I&#x27;ve tried before. I didn&#x27;t think that the Olay strip was very moisturizing because I still felt the need to use a shaving gel. I have very thick hair so razors really have to be amazing for me to notice a difference. This just felt like every razor I&#x27;ve used in the past. If you have thin, blond hair I think this would be perfect for your. Otherwise, I wouldn&#x27;t spend nine dollars on this.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I was offered to try this for free from a program run by Gillette Venus. I have always suffered from dry skin, so much that I generally avoid shaving my legs in the winter and have to hardcore moisturize them in the summer when I do. We also see shaving cream as an unnecessary product in my house, so I usually have to resort to soap or conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;The Good: This razor does an excellent job of shaving. The blades are very tiny and very sharp and they gave me a very close shave. I still have a few stubbles and hairs that it missed (not to mention any ingrown hairs) but for the most part it did a great job of getting as close as possible- something that I find a rarity in women&#x27;s razors.&lt;br /&gt;The moisture bars are extremely moisturizing and do a fantastic job of providing just enough slick to shave but not so much that it clogs the razor.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very pleasant. It&#x27;s a nice calming smell but not overbearing. They do have an unscented one for those people that are allergic to perfumes and scents too!&lt;br /&gt;Although I don&#x27;t use the shower hook, it does come with one.&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: Although this razor does an excellent job of moisturizing, it almost seems as if the moisture comes off a little bit TOO easy and it seems if some of the moisture bar is wasted. After four uses, my moisture bars were flat with the razor and had a lot of residue. It also tended to make the armpit area a little stickier (easily removed with soap). The last thing is the cost. It&#x27;s definitely up there in the pricier razor range, which, if you&#x27;re using it in the summer you&#x27;re going to be using it often and have to replace your blades more often to get the maximum efficiency from the moisture bars.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I probably will not purchase replacement heads for the summer, but definitely will buy when winter comes.</li>
    <li> The venus and gillette razor is a convenient razor that provides a luxurious shaving experience. I was provided the razor in the scent \\&quot;sugarberry\\&quot; by a program run by Gillette Venus. The scent is a little on the sweeter side and may not suit everyone&#x27;s taste. I found it to be quite a nice scent that stays on your legs after shaving. While using this razor, I didn&#x27;t accidentally cut myself, which is a bonus for me! The moisture bars lubricate your legs as you shave and creates a nice foamy lather, similar to that of a shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;Although the moisture bars were very creamy, they did not make my legs feel any smoother than if I had shaves with any other razor. Another downside of this razor would be the lasting power of the moisture bars. The moisture bars only lasted about 4-5 times for me. If you shave every day or every other day like I do, this wold mean having to replace cartridges every week or every other week. This would be extremely costly.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great razor for those who don&#x27;t mind spending the extra money.</li>
    <li> I got a great close shave, but at the same time the soap on the razor was to soapy that it couldn&#x27;t get the hard places. It would be toooo slippery and I would have to wash off the ENTIRE area to shave the area completely.  I love the smell and there&#x27;s no irritation or razor burns after, it&#x27;s just that it can get annoying if it&#x27;s overly soap. The downside is not the packaging per se, but rather that suction cup. It doesn&#x27;t stick on at all so i can&#x27;t use the holder, which sucks because I was really looking forward to using that. It seemed really convenient since I hate putting my razor down on the tub since it gets rusty faster that way.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a great razor and I&#x27;d definitely buy another one (the one i have was provided by a program from gilette venus)</li>
    <li> When I first received this razor through a program run by Gillete, I was so excited to try it out because I have incredibly stubborn leg hair and most razors tend to give me razor burn, but I have been impressed my Venus razors in the past. I was especially intrigued by the claim that I wouldn&#x27;t need to use shaving cream with this razor. The first time I tried it, it definitely lived up to its promises. It smoothly removed all my leg hair and left behind a moisturizing gel that smelled awesome. My legs were so smooth I actually ran out of the bathroom as soon as I was done showering to make my boyfriend feel them. Unfortunately, by the third time using this razor, most of the moisturizing strip was gone and I got razor burn as well as a couple nicks. I definitely needed to use shaving cream, and go over parts of my legs multiple times, which made it feel like I was using just another razor. Despite the great first experience, given the cost of the refill cartridges and how few shaves this one actually lasted me, I unfortunately don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying again.</li>
    <li> I loved this razor because there is no need for shaving cream, which makes shaving far less time consuming. However, I did not like how the bottom moisture bar thing dissolved faster than the top one. I&#x27;m definitely going to repurchase this razor. Hopefully I can find it in bulk at Costco.</li>
    <li> I received this Venus &amp; Olay razor from a program run by Gillette Venus, and I was pretty happy with it&#x27;s results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first began using the razor, I found myself happy that I didn&#x27;t have to use messy shaving cream along with my razor since it had two pads of sweet-smelling, creamy gel around the top and bottom to act as a lubricant during the shaving process. The razor worked wonderfully on my underarms, as it just took one or two swoops with the pink razor until they were really soft, leaving practically zero bumps or rips in my skin. I was happy! However, the razor quickly dropped the ball when it came to the challenge of leg-shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaving my underarms, I was excited to shave my not-so-smooth legs, anticipating that they would be a cinch as well. However, much to my dismay, the razor proved to be a little on the incompetent side when it came to shaving legs. I found that I had to keep going over the same spots over and over to get the same smoothness as my underarms. I also felt that the gel pads seemed to be dissolving in the stream of the shower water much too quickly, as I was spending a longer time trying to get a clean shave on my legs. After I tried shaving my legs with this Sugarberry razor, I was disappointed that the gel had almost completely disappeared, and since I wanted to use the razor the next time I was in the shower (for my underarms, most likely) I decided to put the Sugarberry razor down and pick up a different razor- one with out the lubricating gel strips- to finish the job of shaving my legs. I have to note that my legs weren&#x27;t resembling a werewolf&#x27;s when I was shaving with the Sugarberry razor, so I was surprised when it didn&#x27;t seem to shave them well enough. I didn&#x27;t think they would be much of a challenge for this razor, but they seemed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe a suggestion would be to make the blades sharper, or make the gel pads almost less-gelly so that they didn&#x27;t dissolve so quickly in the water? I&#x27;m not sure, I don&#x27;t have a degree in razor-developing, but if the kink is worked out, I would love to buy this razor again. As I said in the beginning, it was really awesome all around: the smell, the style, the effectiveness on tackling underarm hair, the smooth and silky skin it left behind, etc. However, it just wasn&#x27;t up to par on shaving legs. I feel like having smooth legs is a goal for many women who purchase Venus razors, thus I feel like this is an issue that should be solved quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed using this razor though, and if you only need a razor for soft and delicate shaving, this one&#x27;s for you! But if you have a mess of stubborn leg hair, then maybe not...not sure, I don&#x27;t have a degree in razor-developing, but if the kink is worked out, I would love to buy this razor again.

    <li> I received the razor as part of a program run by Gillette Venus. I package comes with one cartridge, a cute pink razor handle, and a shower hook. This product simultaneously moisturizes and provides a close shave that leaves your legs silky smooth. Definitely an improvement on the prior Venus Breeze, which has only 3 blades-  V&amp;O has 5 blades. Smells great too! I also like the convenience of not having to use shaving lotion since this razor has bars.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Razor. I have recently received this via a program run by Gillette to try out, and I am never going back to my old razor. I was having issues with it anyways. Most razors that I use give me real bad razor burn/bumps under my arms and near my bikini line, But this one did not! I didn&#x27;t even have to use shaving cream! I just wet the razor and began my shave. The Olay moisture bars are so amazing, they keep my legs and under arms nice and moisturized and razor bump free. Also I have used this razor several times now and the moisture bars are still abundant! I love that I can get multiple uses out of them when most razor&#x27;s moisture strips only give one use. If you are looking for a great razor this is definitely the one to get :)</li>
    <li> Love love love! I received this razor as a part of a program Gilette Venus was running. I can&#x27;t say enough good things! Definitely my go-to razor in the future. The glide is amazing, and I can use way less shave gel.</li>
    <li> I received this razor to test from a program ran by Venus Gillette. first impression when I took it out of the box was the smell, it is quite beautiful, like a vanilla berry scent. then for the shave, the soap bars were very moisturizing. then when I got out of the show my legs were smooth and soft.....and NO RAZOR BURN!!!! the only complaint I have about this product was that the soap bars on the razor disintegrated a lot after just one use. but nothing major. this is an awesome razor.</li>
    <li> The Venus &amp; Olay razor is great! I was given this via a program run by Gillette Venus to try at home.&lt;br /&gt;The first shave was amazing. My legs were very smooth after the shower. I do feel like the olay part will run out before the razor is entirely dull though. Also, I only liked to use it on my legs - I don&#x27;t think it would work well on the bikini area.</li>
    <li> BEST razor I have ever tried by far. It left me with amazingly smooth legs, and perfectly shaved underarms, too!</li>
    <li> When I first heard about this razor I was a little skeptical because I had never tried it because it was pretty expensive, but I was offered this product through a program that is ran by Gillette Venus so of course I took my chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The things I enjoyed about this product are the 5 blades, no need for shaving cream, and the moisture it leaves on my legs. The 5 blades took off all the hair on my legs without having to go over it multiple times. I love that I do not need shaving cream when using the product. It makes it so easy to just get in the shower, shave the hair right off, and leave. The moisture on the razor leaves my legs feeling AMAZING ! I also love the fact that it comes with a shower holder which sticks to the wall which is perfect. It makes it more convenient and just there when you need it. Also the SugarBerry Scent is so good smelling .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I do not like about this razor is the prices for the replacement razors. Other than that I love this razor and I plan to use this for a while. Overall this is a great razor especially for the summer, your legs will look GREAT. Its honestly worth a try.</li>
    <li> What an amazing razor!  I got this through a program run by Gillette Venus and was not disappointed one bit.  It comes in a cute pink/sparkly package and I was already in love but I know we can&#x27;t judge a razor based on looks alone.  Let me tell you that I loved it even more when I used it.  The razor provides a super close shave and really does leave a silky smooth feeling when you&#x27;re done.  It also hydrates really well but I still like to use lotion after shower. A few times I decided not to use lotion just to test out how it feels and was impressed - no dryness at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the head/razor is larger than what I&#x27;m used to, it still works great.  I was able to get a close shave in all of all the curves of the body. After a few shaves, the moisture bars still work (which is another plus because you don&#x27;t really have to use shaving cream) but I&#x27;m wondering how long they will actually last.  I can also shave super quickly with little chance of cutting myself. Oh, the scent and very pleasant as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product that provides moisture and a quick shave.</li>
    <li> I used the venus and olay razor through a trial program and I loved it. Tye smell of the sugar berry was amazing and it took me about half the time it normally does to shave my legs. I would definitely recommend this to product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have not found any women&#x27;s razors I like until now. I love this razor! When you first open the package you are hit with the awesome smell of the  lotion strips. These lotion strips cause the razor to glide very smooth and you can shave with little to no water and no shaving cream.</li>
    <li> This razor smelt like a sugary confection store. I think a little to much while shaving my legs. This razor was free but I would not repurchase since it was soo expensive. Almost 13 dollars at target to shave your legs is crazy!! I don&#x27;t see how this exploites your legs but i do see how it is almost like a lotion.</li>
    <li> I recently received the Gillette Venus razor through a champaign loved it at first gave a silky shave but a couple days later ended up with ingrown hair and razor bumps so I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing this product anytime soon</li>
    <li> The first time I used the razor I tried to keep an open mind but it wasn&#x27;t a good razor for me. My legs were so slimey after i shaved and it felt disgusting. Although I usually have an issue with all razors and cutting my legs, this time I didn&#x27;t. Over all I didn&#x27;t care to much for the razor and wouldn&#x27;t suggest it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Tried the razor thanks to a program run via Gilette Venus. The Venus &amp; Olay razor&#x27;s 5-blade technology exfoliates for surface skin renewal, feels extra smooth.  Sugarberry-scented Olay Moisture Bars locks in moisture and feels soft. I would recommend to the ladies.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I got it free through a program run by Gillette Venus about a month ago and I have only positive things to say about it. It has been used daily since I received it, and the soapy part on the bottom just fell off today. The top of it is still on and works just as well. No shaving cream or extra soap is needed at all with this razor. The best part is that any of their razor heads will fit on the base part, so you can try out whichever one you like. This razor made my legs feel very smooth and is also good for the bikini area.</li>
    <li> I really do not like this razor. It doesn&#x27;t get a close cut and misses many hairs. It seems like the little soap bars on either side of the blades are not set back enough for the razor to touch skin. I won&#x27;t be buying a refill.</li>
    <li> I have always loved refillable razors, and had wanted to try the GILLETTE VENUS &amp; OLAY RAZOR. Once the opportunity to test it out for free arose, I took it. I&#x27;m glad I did. I LOVE this razor. I didn&#x27;t need to use shaving cream because of the moisturizing soap bar that surrounds the razor. It is a little sticky though. But that just shows you the moisturization is working. I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone who wants a great razor that gives a close shave and works well.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned so i will never turn back to any other ever again :)</li>
    <li> Best quick shave idea turned in to s***tiest shaving invention ever! The shave gel bars melt in less than two weeks and I barely shave because I have had laser done. The angle the stupid shave bars are placed on the blade are so odd that it is impossible to get an even decent leg shave with out cutting yourself! The service was ggreat service and quick delivery. Will definitely  purchase another Venus style.</li>
    <li> This product came with one razor handle and one razor (with a hard soap on top of razor and one on bottom). It looked strange at first and I totally didn&#x27;t get how it was going to work. But it is AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon showering, I got wet. Then decided to use this odd looking razor. The soap melts quickly and the razor slid effortlessly on my legs.  The cut is super close to skin and didn&#x27;t hurt.  Then the second soap kind of puts a layer on after the razor cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really liked was not having to lather my legs with soap before shaving. The all in one is really convenient!  Also it felt safer. I didn&#x27;t have to balance soap or shaving cream and then razor. It was all one swift movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also didn&#x27;t get razor burn in my bikini area which I&#x27;m prone to.  This soap did an excellent job at moisturizing and avoiding the burn. Much appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked well on underarms as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the soap would diminish pretty quickly but it&#x27;s done we&#x27;ll for five showers now.  I will probably replace the soap razor head often because the first use was the best for sure. The rest were still good but not as thick of a lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only mark off is for the fake scent which I find completely unnecessary.  I&#x27;m a big believer in the more natural the better.  Even if it is a razor.</li>
    <li> PROS: I love the scent. All those blades shave fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: The additional blades plus the conditioning strips make it bulky and unwieldy in smaller areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 STARS: Fast doesn&#x27;t always equal efficient. I&#x27;d like this scent on a razor that has few blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Venus in some form or another for years.  I like their razors better as I seem to get fewer cuts and nicks while getting a smoother result.  I&#x27;ve also been using Olay products for years and love their moisturizers so having the two combined together was a match made in heaven for me.  I found that the mosturizer bars left enough of a film to give a clean smooth glide without gunking up the razors (which can reduce the effect of them and result in a less close shave).  I love the feel of my skin after using this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically I love everything about the razor and the mosturizing bars except for the scent.  It was way overpowering for me, but I tend to be a bit sensitive with that so it may not bother some.  They have refill cartridges that don&#x27;t mention a specific scent and I think I will try those when I need them.  Otherwise I would have given this 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0072KNPKI Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Refill Cartridges, 3 Count]][[ASIN:B0072K0SP8 Gillette Venus and Olay Razor]]</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this razor! It&#x27;s light and small and comes with a shower clip so that it hangs on the wall. The soft guard around the blade is extremely comfortable and has prevented (so far) any nicks or cuts when shaving. I am happy to throw out my old razor and switch to this one!</li>
    <li> This Razor is just too much. Too pink, too chunky, too smelly, too packaged, too expensive for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t jumped on the shaving cream/moisturizer on the razor bandwagon. I&#x27;m not a fan. I think I prefer when it&#x27;s just the blade and maybe a small moisture strip. These things are chunky and they break and they wear out at different times than the razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the scent is just god awful. Maybe if I was 12 and this was my first razor, this MIGHT be appropriate.</li>
    <li> I have rather sensitive skin, so always err on the way of caution when it comes to skin care products and shaving products - I have the scars on my legs to prove bad choices, lol.  I am a huge fan of the Gillette Venus line as well as Olay products, so was excited to give this a try since it combined both.  My thoughts?  I was incredibly pleased and will definitely be using more of this product in the future!  The 5 blades allow for a very close and incredibly smooth shave without irritation or worry of cuts and nicks.  The moisture bars lend a pleasant, light and fun scent to the shaving experience and leaves behind a softness that is nice, rather than the papery feel of dry skin.  The flexible head also allows for great ability to glide along curves and ridges so you do not miss any areas.  I also wanted to mention that I usually get 4 - 5 shaves out of one blade.  Overall, I really like this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great razor!</li>
    <li> This razor definitely leaves skin softer than other razors that don&#x27;t have the Olay moisturizer. However, it wasn&#x27;t the closest shave unless I used substantially more pressure than I would with a normal razor. I believe this was due to the moisturizing strips flattening down the hair. Overall, I would recommend this product if you have money to burn... otherwise, just go for the standard razors.</li>
    <li> Well, there is nothing incredibly new about this product. I guess the light scent is... exciting?... but it&#x27;s works like any other Venus razor.  I will say, though, that in general I do really like the Venus line of razors, so you won&#x27;t go wrong by choosing this particular product.</li>
    <li> I love Venus and Olay products so I had to try this razor. I love the scent. I wish the scent was available in a lotion instead of just on a razor. I have read many reviews about people not liking the scent. I personally love it. Though the scent doesn&#x27;t last on the skin since you are just shaving with it and rinsing it off. It is a good razor that leaves your legs feeling smooth. The gel strip works good without having to use shaving lotion. The gel strip does not last long, but it lasts longer than most do. The hanger included to hang your razor in the shower does not hang up very well but is convenient when it does work. Overall, I am very happy with this razor and will buy more.</li>
    <li> This is hands down my new go-to when it comes to shaving. A razor has yet to provide me with legs as smooth. At first I was skeptical that this product would live up to my expectations- no shaving cream needed..really? But it&#x27;s true. The 5 blades are great and in fact, rival my boyfriend&#x27;s razor. I get a close shave and I get the moisture that my dry skin needs. Additionally, the moisture bar smells amazing (sugarberry). I tend to get bumps on my skin after shaving especially if I do not have enough moisture but with this razor I have not experienced this side effect at all. I was given this razor to try out by Gillette and am happy to say that I will purchase this product in the future. This product is most beneficial to those you like a close shave and have skin that is prone to dryness. 5 blades my be a bit overkill for some but not for me.</li>
    <li> Love how smooth this razor made my legs! I got to try this razor thru a Venus program. And there is no reason why I wouldn&#x27;t buy this razor again in the near future!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor! I received it through a special offer with Gillette Venus. It gives the best shine, closest shave, and you don&#x27;t have to buy shaving cream. It smells delicious too! I recommend this to any women out there who truly want the best shave!</li>
    <li> I recieved this razor though a promotion , and I must sy I love this Olay Venus razor. The scent is amazing ! And it leaves my legs feeling like baby skin soft. I will be buying this razor for my future razor needs !</li>
    <li> I was able to get a free razor from a program run by Gillette Venus and I am so glad I was able to try this out! I&#x27;m always on the go and don&#x27;t have the time to lather up and shave! I&#x27;m also prone to getting cuts! With the Venus &amp; Olay Razor I was able to shave around my knee and ankle without any worries. At first I was even skeptical that it was shaving because it was such a smooth shave but once I felt my leg it was incredibly smooth! This will definitely be my go to razor!</li>
    <li> I love the Venus razors because they provide a very smooth shave and you don&#x27;t need to use shaving cream with them unless you want to. The Sugarberry one is my favorite because I like the scent.</li>
    <li> My daughter had her first shave last month with a cheap disposable razor. She complained that it was painful, and refused to shave after that. Gillette sent us a free Venus &amp; Olay Sugarberry Scent razor for us to try. It gives a close smooth shave, and my daughter didn&#x27;t have one complaint. A plus is that it comes with a suction holder for the shower! The design of the handle makes it easy to use as well. Five stars!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor. The close shaving without having to worry about nicking or cutting myself is a big plus and also my skin is nice and smooth and isn&#x27;t dry at all.</li>
    <li> Gillette let me tried the &amp;#34;Venus &amp; Olay razor&amp;#34; for free! I wasn&#x27;t to sure about, but we gave it a try and me and my daughter loved it!!! It leaves our skin nice and moisturize and silky from the Olay, it doesn&#x27;t leave my legs with the little bumps or my legs looking like chicken skin lol.. We absolutely loved it!</li>
    <li> I recieved my free razor from Gillette and I love it. Even though the moisture bars leave a mess under your arms, I did love the results. I got a clean, close shave with no stubbles left over. Will I buy refills? Most definitely!</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me the Venus &amp; Olay(tm) Razor in Sugarberry for free through BzzAgent.  It is a great way to shave your legs without all the dryness involved.  Don&#x27;t have time to apply shave gel, don&#x27;t worry!  The Venus &amp; Olay(tm) Razor in Sugarberry has the Olay Moisture Bars built in.  Not only does it give a close shave without needing shaving cream, it actually prevented me from nicking my legs!  Now, I will never look for another shaver, Venus &amp; Olay(tm) Razor makes my legs feel so soft &amp; smooth!</li>
    <li> I Got my free sample from Gillette® and I absolutely love it!!! my legs feel smooth and silkier! It worked great on all my body parts ! I will definitely be buying this razor from now on!!!</li>
    <li> Not too bad, it left my legs soft and smooth the first couple of shaves, after that i would suggest exfoliating before to continue to get the close shave. The moisture bar was really nice left my legs really soft but by the 3rd use was looking really thin and like it might fall off. Great razor if you can afford to switch the heads after about 5 shaves but I just can&#x27;t. Thank Gillette for sending it to me for free through, that was awesome.</li>
    <li> Definitely a 5 star product. My teenage daughter absolutely loves it. It is a very close, smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Overall great shave. No shaving cream required. This razor does as it advertised it has two moisture bars one on the top and one on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Provides a nice clean shave. holder hangs in shower well to avoid the moisture bars from sitting in water.</li>
    <li> Received this item, free from Gillette to try it out! It&#x27;s a good product! Great for the first timers out there!! The surround around the blades smells awesome!!!! My oldest daughter is 12.5 yrs old and used this product as a first time shaver, no nicks, cuts or razor burn but, not a super close shave either. It may have been operator error, seeing it was her first time. Will buy her more refills since I feel this is a little more safe than other razor&#x27;s out there on the market!</li>
    <li> This razor is great for the young user.  The moisture bar is awesome and smells wonderful.  It creates a silky glide.  However, I have been blessed with coarse hair on my legs and really need something that gives a closer shave.  The moisture bar really seems to prevent the razor from getting close enough to my skin to give me as close of a shave as I get with other razors.  I received a free razor from BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> I recently received my Venus &amp; Olay razor free from Gillette.  I love it!  It makes my skins so smooth and cuts great.  I will definitely be using this again.</li>
    <li> We received this razor through bzzagent, for free!  I gave this to my tween daughter for her first shave.  Wow!  This razor was so gentle on her legs without the need for shaving cream.  Two thumbs up here, and will continue to buy for my daughter!</li>
    <li> I received this free for a trial through a company called BzzAgent.  It is great for beginner shavers, as the large handle &amp; pivoting head give you great control. The 5 blades give a closer shave, with a lower risk of nics &amp; cuts. I would definitely purchase &amp; use this as my regular razor.</li>
    <li> WOW - Absolutely love love love the Gillette Venus with Olay - and I will be buying the replacement cartridges down the road!  Close shave, super smooth feeling, easy to use, and love the way it feels in my hand (and I have small hands) -  used to always really &amp;#34;cheep&amp;#34; out on products for shaving but after receiving this product free from Gillette - they got me!  Thank you Gillette for thinking about the women out here :)</li>
    <li> I am on the fence about The Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Razor.  When I received it in the mail free I couldn&#x27;t wait to open it and use it.  I would very much like to be able to shave without using any shave gel.  It didn&#x27;t seem to help having the Olay bars, the razor seemed to drag along, and was scrappy to my legs.  I did go over my legs again, because I thought maybe I wasn&#x27;t holding it right, I really love the Gillette products, normally, after all they have been around for many, many years so we know they are doing something right!! I love the idea of 5 blades, I live in Florida, and I wear shorts or capris all year long, so do a lot of shaving spend a lot of money on these products normally.  Maybe another style would be better for me, not sure at this point!! I just don&#x27;t ant to have to keep going over my legs, especially with 5 blades.  I will try again!!</li>
    <li> I totally love this razor because it eliminates me having to use shaving cream and  the 5 blades aids in a close shave without cuts or any skin irritation. I received it complimentary from Gillette along with a $5 off replacement blade coupon. I have VERY sensitive skin and I normally always cut myself so this worked fabulous for me.  I have a young daughter who also tried it for her first shave and I  felt it was safe enough to allow her to use on her own after she watched me. The handle was easy to hold onto (very nice smooth grip) and I love the little suction cup hanger it came with so I could have easy access to it in my shower. It is said to be scented but it must be a very light fragrance because it didn&#x27;t trigger my allergies or my daughters. I would absolutely recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin, young daughters or anyone who wants a close shave fast. Yes, it took less strokes for me to shave with this razor than with the cheap razors I normally buy. So far I have only shaved twice in the past week.</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette Venus razor with Olay free from Gillette last week and I love the smooth soft skin it leaves . The contored handle made it easy and comfortable to use , Another great product from Gillette !!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I recently received this razor from Gillette for free. We LOVE it! It gives a nice close shave, and eliminates the need of using shave cream or lotion. The Olay strips leave our legs feeling silky soft and smooth. Great product Gillette, and Thank You for letting us try it!</li>
    <li> First time shave for our girl. Being a BzzAgent, I #GotItFree from Gillette, to try for myself, and my daughter. It provides a nice, smooth shave. It stays close to the skin, to all the \\&quot;hills and valleys\\&quot; of the leg. It was easy for her to hold, and use. The Olay strips help to keep the skin very moisturized. If you are searching for a razor, to make your daughter&#x27;s first shave easier, try this one!</li>
    <li> My 14 year old tried this one out. This was a Gillette Venus razor with 5 blades and olay soap on both sides of the shaver. My daughter said the design of the razor had a comfortable and manageable grip. The style and colors were pleasing to the eye. Having 5 blades was efficient; no stray hairs were missed. My daughter said the soap made her legs softer and the razor glided easier over her legs. What she didn&#x27;t like was once the soap got wet, it started falling off the razor, made a mess all over the shower shelves. So essentially the olay soap idea was really only obtainable one time...after that it fell off. She decided you would stick with a plain Gillette venus razor. Good try Gillette, but not a satisfactory product or worth the money</li>
    <li> I received the Venus &amp; Olay Razor FREE from Gilette and my picky, 19 year old daughter absolutely loved it!!  The closest, softest shave ever.  This is our new razor from now on!  Thank you, Gilette!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Venus free from Gillette for testing because I am a Bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will start by saying I really loved using this razor and I love the close shave I am getting with no razor burn. I read one review that they did not think it curves good. I totally disagree. When I shave my knees with my normal razor it is usually very hard to do. This razor made it so simple and I could see it moving right with the curve in my knees. I did not get cut once and it shaved so easy and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the &amp;#34;slime&amp;#34; it has to it from the moisture bar. This razor says it has a scent, but I honestly have not been able to smell anything while shaving or after.</li>
    <li> I got this product as a free promotion from Gilette to try out, my teenage daughter &amp; I both love it.  The design is very nice and easy to hold onto in the shower or tub, the 5 blades make for a nice smooth shave with little to no irriation after wards, cute colors if your into that and a variety of different &amp;#34;scents&amp;#34; on the soap end and even a sensitive skin one.  Glad we got to try this &amp; will for sure be getting more!!</li>
    <li> I got my Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Sugarberry Scent did not disappoint my daughter at all.  For a first time user it was great.  It glided over her skin nicely and she had no cuts or other abrasion that you find with some razors.  We already bought a refill for when this one is dull.  It was a great first experience in shaving.  She is hooked.  SO.. I bought myself one of the razors as well and I am very happy with the results.  no cuts, razor burns, or chapped skin.  LOVE IT is all I can say.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I were very happy with the Venus and Olay razor and found it was easy to maneuver around the various curves of knees and ankles and provided the smooth, clean shave we all seek! The moisturizing of the Olay bars was wonderful and also made this a good choice for vacation as you can just grab the Venus and Olay razor and leave the bulky can of shave gel at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was prevented from giving this 5 stars only by the fact that the moisturizing bars only seemed to last for two full shaves (both full legs and underarms) before they felt worn down and began to drag. But the blades were still optimal for a close shave with a little added soap!</li>
    <li> I received Venus razors from Gillette for free for my daughter to try. She has needed to start shaving her under arms, so I helped her the first time and these razors worked great for her. She now uses them herself. Close shave with no nicks &amp; cuts &amp; no razor bumps &amp; burn.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have BOTH fallen in love with the Venus &amp; Olay Razor! As a BzzAgent, I received one free from Gillette and after trying it out, we immedicately went and bought another one so that we each had our own.&lt;br /&gt;The razor makes for a super-close shave and with the addition of the Olay moisture bars, we have the softest and smoothest legs for days! Considering we live in Arizona, and are swimming or outside in shorts EVERY day, this razor is a must for us!</li>
    <li> I received this beautiful razor free from Gillette and I absolutely love it. The smell from the Olay Sugarberry scent bars was delicious. I am truly a fan. My legs felt like pure silk.</li>
    <li> I recieved the Venus &amp; Olay™ Razor free to try from BzzAgent.  I liked how soft the Olay Moisture Bars left my skin and the 5 blades were perfect for a close shave.  My skin didn&#x27;t feel tight and itchy after I got out of the shower, but was soft and moisturized instead.  The handle is large and easy to use with great grips.  The head pivots well and shaves underarms and knees with no trouble.  This is a great razor!</li>
    <li> Performs as expected. No issues</li>
    <li> Why should my razor smell good when I am going about the tedious process of shaving my legs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE NO IDEA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ALSO do not like the cheap thing which comes in this package which you are supposed to hang the razor from, and just leave it exposed in your bath or shower. What if you have kids? Danger!  Or, and this is an odd thought, but it *could* happen, what if you are cleaning the tiles one day and your razor is up there and you just cut yourself on it? While you are cleaning?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not big on using the word random, but there are so many random smells in the USA from fake cleaning and freshening products it is like the country has gone crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least this razor doesn&#x27;t vibrate. Call me funny but I prefer to choose objects that vibrate WITHOUT 5 sharp blades. So score one for the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Sugarberry&lt;br /&gt;(Sugarberry? Is this the land of the Smurfs?) Scent Razor 1 Kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, jean</li>
    <li> So I still have Venus razors. My favorite is the Embrace, and that has not changed with this. Like the Spa version, this blade feels a bit slimy, necessary I guess to replace the shaving cream you would use otherwise. The scent was a pleasant surprise. I really enjoyed it. I am not sure it would be ideal for someone with sensitive skin, and I know individuals who are allergic to Olay products. Those individuals should probably stay away. Those who like the Spa, built in shaving cream though ought to like this a lot. Still a top notch shave although I thought the original kits used to come with two blades. It&#x27;s a shame they&#x27;ve cut back a bit.</li>
    <li> I really liked the Venus &amp; Olay Razor. I got one for free from Gillette to try (mom pouted when she saw she didn&#x27;t get one to try too *grin*). It was a close shave, and as long as I still have the moisture bar attached (I always hate when the strips on other razors just plop off....I hope this holds up better) and moist, I never have too little shave lotion or gel because it provided it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately there were things I didn&#x27;t like a lot.  For a quick shave, I would usually use lotion so I don&#x27;t feel like I have to shower all over again.  Just a quick damp wipe.  The lotion in the razor&#x27;s bar is just too slimy feeling for that.  I really feel like it needs to be washed off thoroughly instead, and the patch I think I missed washing completely trying to hurry felt weird when it dried and I had to run back to wash it completely off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t really like the huge head.  I get how safe it is...but it&#x27;s not very conveniently shaped for storage (and comes with NO travel cap or case  :^(  ...) or really for use.  Wide smooth areas yes, great.  When it came to knees, behind my knees, ankles, etc. it was very difficult to get into curves and angles...around bones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I am in the shower or bath tub and have a long time to take my time and completely wash and rinse afterwards I will enjoy the Venus &amp; Olay Razor.  But when I have somewhere to be, or am in a hurry...especially when doing a quick dry or lotion shave touch up, I will need another style of razor to use instead.</li>
    <li> I normally use men shavers but I was able to try this for free from gillette, and 1 week later I still have a close clean soft shave. I always have to shave every few days and I always knick myself thats one reason I switch to mens however i received all of the above from venus except i have a longer clean shave :) i am surprised to see how no hair is on my legs even after a week!!!! My legs are still smooth also so the lotion they put in it is awesome  and you dont even need to use shaving cream. So the benefits are close shaves, no cuts, longer shaves , no shaving cream (so u save money) and this product is great for gIrls starting off and also for women who hate having hair grow back in a few days!!! I will never use another razor aGAIN</li>
    <li> I recently tried the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay razor. I love it! I normally use my husband&#x27;s razors as I can not find a &amp;#34;female&amp;#34; razor that works well. Well guess what....  I just found one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This razor has two Olay moisture bars on the top and bottom of the razor head. I am still indecisive about the moisture bars. After one use the top bar was completely one. It fell off after my first leg. The second bar is still going strong! The bars do tend to make your leg extra slippery! So please be careful. I did how ever get a very close and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;I do love the grip handle. Not only is it a beautiful pink color but you can hold on to it with easy. Even though my legs were very slippery  did not loose grip nor cut myself at all. I do like not having to worry about cutting myself and ending up with scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; All in all I would recommend this product to new shavers and old. I feel Gillette did a wonderful job on this new product. I personally will continue to use and buy this product. I am very pleased with the end result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: I have received this product free of charge from BzzAgent for testing purposes. Please note any and all of my opinions are f my own and have not been altered in an way, shape or form.</li>
    <li> I really liked this razor! I received a free sample from Gillette and thought it sounded perfect for my pre teen daughter who is just starting to shave!  It was easy for her to use, sensitive on her skin, and didn&#x27;t leave her skin irritated!!!  It was so nice that I purchased one for myself!  I definetly would recommend for women of all ages! It&#x27;s a great value and is great for your skin. It didn&#x27;t leave me dry and irritated!</li>
    <li> While I was never a fan of razors with shaving cream attached, or moisturizing strips as this one did. I didn&#x27;t care for the slimy feeling that the olay moisture strips left while shaving, I found it was a close and comfortable shave. The handle was easy to grip and use, I didn&#x27;t have any shifting or slipping while using it. There was no razor burn itching me afterwards, which was again a bonus. The olay strips did get stuck to the holder though and when they ripped a little it made for an uncomfortable shave. I was able to get a good week out of it first, I think it would have lasted longer than that. It is really a mixed bag at this point, the shave and feeling was nice, ease of use, very nice. But the fact that it only lasted a week makes me wonder how much it would cost me in a year to purchase refills at that rate. Needs a better storage system. But I am glad I was able to try it free through Gilette. It let me know the strips and moisturizers aren&#x27;t as bad as I previously thought.</li>
    <li> This is a good razor. It is easy to use and really helps prevent cutting my legs or under arms. I like the feel of it.&lt;br /&gt;My granddaughter has one and that is where I first heard about this type of razor.</li>
    <li> I love Olay products and my previous razor was a Venus, and you can&#x27;t lose with a combination of both those brands, right? This razor is great. I get a super close shave without any irritation. My only complaint is that the razor&#x27;s head is pretty big so it is hard to maneuver in some places. It smells good, but the smell isn&#x27;t lasting and with all the other products women use in the shower, they probably won&#x27;t notice the smell. Good quality razor!</li>
    <li> I got this shaver from a program ran by Gillette Venus and I used it as soon as I opened and it worked I didn&#x27;t think it would work as good as it did being that the hair in my legs are very thick(not mannish though) and I was able to get all the hair gone with about 2 swipes also to add my skin tends to itch a lot after shaving and with this my legs did itch but not excessively but it also left it smooth to the touch and that was before I added lotion good job I will definitely spread the Word</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very finicky about my razors and shaving. I hate having to get shaving cream and go through all the motions so anything that cuts out a couple steps for me is great. I shower and shave so the water activated the razor and got a nice close shave with the moisturizing bar. Nice silky legs and a quick set up too? Whats not to like? If you like quick and easy \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot; I&#x27;d suggest trying this, though your replacement head will be pricey. Know that you can replace the head with any Venus cartridge.</li>
    <li> I can not believe how much softer my legs feel after my very first shave with the Venus &amp; Olay Razor that I received free from Gillette. I shaved my legs while in the shower and didn&#x27;t need to use shaving cream, to get a close, smooth shave...this razor is fantastic!! No nicks or cuts, just soft, silky smooth, moisturized legs! The Sugarberry scent is an added bonus. This razor is my new favorite and I can see me using it for years to come. Thank you Venus &amp; Olay Razor for being my new shaving buddy!!</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing! It&#x27;s so smooth and doesn&#x27;t nick or cut like other razors I&#x27;ve used in the past. And the added Olay makes it so I don&#x27;t need to use shave gel. A great razor to teach your tweens how to shave with! I find it to be safe and effective! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have used a Schick Intuition since they first came out and I never thought I could be stolen away but The Venus has done it. And what a fantastic starter razor for my daughter. I love that it has all the benefits of the other shaving bar razors but works so much better for tinier hands. and the Olay bar is amazing and I can&#x27;t get enough of hearing how smooth my skin feels even days after I have shaved. New favorite razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this razor free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from Gillette to try it our, and I am so happy with the results. I loved how I don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream or soap with this razor!  I was a little concerned at first, but I works GREAT without either of those!  I have been using the same brand of razor for no joke, 12 years.  And I am now going to be making the switch!  It also works very well on the bikini area, which I didn&#x27;t think would be true because of the shape.  The handle is perfect and very comfortable to use!  I would recommend this razor to everyone.  My only complaint is that the Olay soap doesn&#x27;t last as long as the razor, but that is okay because I just lathered my legs with soap and it still works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> This is a good razor, but it doesn&#x27;t work any better than the one with 3 blades. The moisture strips on the top and bottom are always nice to have because it saves time. I&#x27;m adding this to my regular rotation with the Schick Hydro Silk which also has 5 blades. I think that was shaves a little bitter, but the &amp;#34;silk&amp;#34; beads on that razor are not as effectives as the moisture strips on this razor.</li>
    <li> this razor was provided to me by Gillette Venus on a trial basis, I loved it! It made shaving my legs smell and feel wondeful. My favorite part is not needing shaving cream, although the sweet berry lotioning pads can make the razor a bit slippery. overall I would purchase this razor  :-)</li>
    <li> Loved this new razor ! Got to ditch the shaving cream that was messy and wasted time, and didn&#x27;t need to use anything! The Olay bars around the five blades were perfectly enough and I actually had less nicks and cuts and a closer shave, even around my knees! As a bzzagent getting products like these for free to try and review, i would and will reccommend to all my girl friends, and if I didn&#x27;t like this razor, trust me I would tell them not to go anywhere near it but this ones a 10!</li>
    <li> I love this razor! It&#x27;s works great and doesn&#x27;t leave razor burn. I didn&#x27;t even have to use shaving cream. I just wet the razor and started shaving.</li>
    <li> I had the experience to try a sample of the Venus &amp; Olay Razor in Sugarberry via a program by Gillette Venus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the package, I smelled the fragrant smell of the sugarberry. It&#x27;s a perfect scent for the summer, I enjoyed being able to walk through out the day enjoying the scent. Also, the grip on the razor was perfect to hold when I was shaving.When I shave the razor sometimes slips out of my hand and this razor did not do that.&lt;br /&gt;My one disappointment is that the moisture bar was kind of sticky and was not as moisturizing as my shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I enjoyed my shaving experience and my legs were very smooth. This would be a razor that I will use often during this summer.</li>
    <li> i got the razor was provided via a program run by Gillette Venus. I was so excited when I opened the box and could smell the  sweet scent.I didn&#x27;t nick or cut myself once!  It doesn&#x27;t work very well on underarms. I would use it for my legs and use another for my underarms.</li>
    <li> I got my razor in the mail Saturday from Gillette Venus, which was perfect because I was headed to the beach later that night. When I opened the package I was a little disappointed because the package the razor was it was a waste. It was one razor with no refills and when I looked up the price its 12.00 dollars. Though when I shaved my legs I was in love with the razor it was a close shave and my legs were so smooth for many days.</li>
    <li> Not only do I love the amazing grip on the handle, but my legs! After trying this product I told everyone I could. My legs are now way softer, and much more moisturized! I will never go back!</li>
    <li> I really like this razor - it makes shaving so much easier and quicker. It has built in moisture bars so you don&#x27;t need shaving cream at all and the best part is NO razor burn like I get with plain ordinary razors. I like that it has 5 blades too, this gets a smoother shave and no need to go over the same area multiple times. And no stubblies or dry skin! My legs and arms don&#x27;t feel dry at all after using this, it&#x27;s quite moisturizing and I could probably go without lotion afterwards - which is nice especially when I&#x27;m in a hurry or when it&#x27;s hot and humid outside. The product also smells really good which is the first thing i noticed (scent is a big deal for me because I have a sensitive nose and hate chemically/strongly scented shaving products) this one smells light and fruity-sweet.  Also really like that the Venus razor handles fit ALL their different cartridges. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to anyone who shaves, and even more so to anyone who despises shaving creams/gels like I do. It&#x27;s a wonderful 2-in-1 product.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product via a program run by Gilette Venus.</li>
    <li> I received my Venus &amp; Olay in Sugarberry scent through a Free program held by Gillette Venus. I was really excited to get my razor through the mail and shaved with it instantly. It is a great product, however it is not for me. I tend to get razor bumps with almost every razor that I use and this was no different. I would definitely reccommend trying it out for yourself it is just not my it razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The Package is so easy to open! You don&#x27;t have to bring out the chainsaw for this one&lt;br /&gt;  It comes with a holder that you can place in your shower&lt;br /&gt;  The handle has a perfect grip so you don&#x27;t have to worry as much about slipping and cutting yourself&lt;br /&gt;  The five blades do a wonderful job at getting you a nice close shave&lt;br /&gt;  It does have a nice scent(to begin with)&lt;br /&gt;  The olay moisture bar is nice, it is not necessary to use shave cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The razor head is so bulky it is hard to maneuver the creases&lt;br /&gt;  The scent does not stay&lt;br /&gt;  The moisture bar comes in handy while you are shaving, however when it comes to putting it away it is still slimy and gross just getting all over everything&lt;br /&gt;  The moisture bar is also useful as far as not needing shave cream, however I still needed to put on lotion after the shave because they had gotten dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I say try it out. Everyone&#x27;s skin type and experiences vary. Who knows this could be your IT razor!</li>
    <li> Look -- I am a crappy 12 pack of cheap disposable razor user. That is me, all the way. I don&#x27;t even commit to shaving cream, I use body wash or conditioner. But THIS -- this razor is awesome. I received it for free through a program with Gillette Venus to test, and I was skeptical. I don&#x27;t like fancy razors, especially two-in-ones. They&#x27;re overpriced and kind of inconvenient. I mean, you can&#x27;t find these refills just anywhere, and I can grab a disposable razor wherever the heck I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I LOVE this razor. WIthin the first shave, I knew it was meant to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor shaves close to the skin and just feels good. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about cutting myself when I shaved around my ankles or my knees. The Olay moisture bar does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to, and I love the fun, flirty Sugarberry scent. My boyfriend noticed how smooth and soft my legs were the minute I left the shower! This is a GREAT product.</li>
    <li> This razor worked great on my legs, and keeps them moisturized better than any razor or lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. The Olay product on this razor is amazing, and a great addition to the Gillette Venus razor, which is the only one I used up until trying this new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Downside: For me, the razor is too bulky for my private area, however I will continue to use this razor for my legs as is it seriously the best thing to happen to my legs in this lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> my new venus olay razor came in the mail 2 days ago. ive had the opportunity to use it a few times. overall I love the product. you definitely don&#x27;t need shaving cream. my only concern is that I would be replacing cartridges constantly because the olay part of the razor runs out too quick. and they are very high in price. other than that, I love the razor.</li>
    <li> I got the Venus &amp; Olay razor in sugarberry through a program run by Gillette Venus to try and I really liked the razor. The Olay moisture bars made my skin softer and it absolutely true that you do not need to use shaving cream with this razor, it is WONDERFUL! I will save SO much money not having to buy shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side to the Venus &amp; Olay razor in sugarberry is that the cartridge does not seem to last as long as some of the other Venus razor cartridges. I think the Olay moisture bars might make it so it does not last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all this is my favorite razor by Venus I just wish that the cartridges would last longer.</li>
    <li> I have used many, many different kinds of razors, and finally  was able to get this razor to try through a program run by Gillette Venus and must I say I fell in LOVE! Not only does it smell great, it shaves really well and not having to use shaving cream is a major plus!! After I used it my legs were smooth and for the most part moisturized although I did need lotion awhile later in the day. The only bad part is that if you keep this razor in the shower and it gets wet when you aren&#x27;t using it the creamy(?) part on the outside begins to disintegrate very quickly so I would keep it somewhere else, otherwise this is a great razor and I would suggest it to anyone!</li>
    <li> my legs are in heaven. They have never been this smooth ever!!!! I will never buy another brand razor again!!! when I got out of the shower I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth and soft my legs was!!!!I have been searching far and wide for a razor this good and I found it thanks to bzzagent :)</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing! I tried it out for the first time last night and it made my legs so soft and smooth. I always use a Venus razor when shaving, but this is by far my favorite because it smells awesome. I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves Venus or just wants a great smooth leg after shaving. The razor was provided to me via a program run by Gillette Venus</li>
    <li> I love this razor. It really gave me a smooth close shave without drying my legs out and NO SHAVING CREAM NEEDED! Its all in one and so so easy! Its so quick and painless I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to an ordinary razor! I received my razor from the Gillette venus and olay campaign and I absolutely adore it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of Venus razors because they&#x27;ve provided the closest and longest lasting shave than any other razors I have tried, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried a lot. I just got the new Venus &amp; Olay razor this week and I absolutely love it. The Olay moisture bars really do provide my legs with an intense moisture and my legs have never felt smoother. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use any other razor again. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I recently tried out this product,which was sent to me via a program run by Gillette Venus. I love the packing, although that might have to do with the fact that I am in my teens and am attracted to anything girly. This razor made shaving my legs a very fast process, in one sweep it was gone and my legs felt very smooth after i was done. I assume that the softness was due to the moisture bars because after running the razor over my legs, it left a trail behind from the bars. Although after getting out of the shower i found myself reaching for some lotion, therefore it wasn&#x27;t as moisturizing as i expected it to be. The sugar-berry scent is a plus, i fell in love with it and will be looking for a smell similar to it. The sent however washes away once your done shaving which is a bummer for me. I honestly wish it would have stayed. I know that sometimes after trying out a product some of us tend to not be in love with it and have a different point of views on it then others. If you don&#x27;t completely love it, Gillette will give you back 2x your money but you must keep your receipt in order to send it back. I however will be repurchasing this product in the near future.</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a program via Gillette Venus. I love this razor! my legs are silky smooth and not dry! The grip on the handle make the razor easy to control so I don&#x27;t cut or nick myself. I love the changeable cartridges so I can mix and match and try different  scents. I can feel and see a difference in my skin! This is the best razor!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor! Sugar berry scent is divine. My legs are silky smooth and feel more hydrated then ever! the razor was provided via a program run by Gillette Venus.</li>
    <li> This razor works amazing and I love the scent! It gave me such a good shave, no nicks,bumps or razor burn which I normally get with other razors. I got to try this from a program through Venus and now that I&#x27;ve tried it I would highly recommend it and buy it again. I also love the soap that comes on it, keeps you moisturized and soft!</li>
    <li> I was excited to be reciving this from a program run by Gillette Venus. When i opened it and felt it i saw that the moisture bars weren&#x27;t securely attatched to the razor head? Also as well the bars seem like soap and the smell was not very berry smelling but i guess i can&#x27;t expect it too. When i used it i did not need shaving cream but after a few uses i noticed there was so much moisture that it blocked the razor blades. It was also hard to use since the bars were so large and fragile :( it did though glide very well and shaved very well. I also found that it was hard shaving other parts of my body besides my legs.In the end it left a dry like soap feel but my legs were very smooth and silky and the blades got every hair. Would i purchase this again? Maybe.</li>
    <li> My first time using the razor I had to wet it for a while until it got soapy. When i was actually shaving my legs the blades felt very sharp against my skin and I was worried about cutting myself, but maybe that is just because it was the first time using it. The olay bars made my legs very soapy after a little while and shaving felt very slippery, even more so than soap or shaving cream. After the soap washed off my legs felt kind of rubbery while still in the shower. Shaving my bikini and underarms was ok, but I think I get a better and closer shave when I use my schick quatro. Maybe it was because the soap bars were so big that the razor couldn&#x27;t get as close to the skin in non flat areas like armpits and bikini. I have to say that I was very iffy on this razor until I got out of the shower. Everywhere I shaved feels very soft and moisturized. My legs feel great and are perfectly shaved. My underarms and bikini aren&#x27;t perfectly shaved, but they are very soft as well. I am really impressed by the moisture the razor leaves behind, but I do wonder if I could just achieve this with my schick quatro and maybe some olay body wash. I really dont mind putting soap on my legs before I shave.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive the chance from Venus and Olay to try out their new razor. I had used Venus razors before both with the big bar and without and much rather used the razor without the giant bar. I never felt I got a close enough shave. With the new Venus and Olay razor I felt I had a close shave and the benefit of softening my skin. My only complaint was that after 24 hours my legs started to feel stubbly but that could just be me. I definitely would recommend this razor for someone who doesn&#x27;t like to take the time with a shave gel (and even those who do).</li>
    <li> Super close shave, no shaving cream needed, what else could you ask for in a razor? It left my legs incredibly smooth. No cuts which for me never happens! The best part about it is you don&#x27;t need shaving cream! The only downside I noticed was that the soap that comes on it runs out rather quickly.</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a campaign run by Gillette Venus to try it out and now I&#x27;ll be buying it! This razor definitely left my legs smooth and soft and CUT-FREE! The blades don&#x27;t have to be changed too often which is great. I didn&#x27;t miss any spots like I usually do with other razors. This razor definitely took up any hair that you wanted it to get. I would definitely recommend it if you are having issues finding a good, dependable razor.</li>
    <li> I loved using the Venus &amp; Olay razor in Sugarberry. I smelled amazing and left my legs incredibly smooth. The soap lathers and hydrates so well, which made it fast and easy to shave without worrying about shaving cream. Will definitely be using this razor from now on!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor. It made my skin feel silky smooth and I didn&#x27;t even need to use my own cream. My legs were extremely happy with how moisturized they were and I was actually impressed with how close of a shave I achieved. It is a very nice touch to not have to waste money on shaving cream, too. The Venus &amp; Olay razor is a winner and I don&#x27;t plan on switching to another razor any time soon.</li>
    <li> I received the Olay Razor through a program sponsored by Gillette and decided to try it out. From the very first stroke of the razor I was hooked. My legs feel so much smoother from the uses of the past week. I also love the moisturizing capabilities. I found that my legs needed no additional moisture or lotion in order for them to stay smooth and soft all day. I will definitely be purchasing more as I need :)</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Sugarberry Scent Razor kit for free via a program run by Gillette. First of all, the packaging is so cute and so is the actual razor. The razor has a soft grip which I really like. The scent was very nice, although it smelt more like green apples than sugarberry! I loved that it came with a hook to hang it up in your shower to dry. My legs were so smooth after shaving with this product and my boyfriend told me so too. I didn&#x27;t have to use any shaving cream. Overall, I really enjoy this razor.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be able to go back to using a regular razor after using the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Razor. Not only does it make shaving so much easier, it drastically reduces the time it takes me to shave. It leaves the area I shave feeling really soft and smooth. While this razor was provided to me by a program run by Gillette Venus I would definitely purchase this with my own money. Two thumbs up from me!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I really love how the razor leaves your skin feeling soft and supple after each use. Your skin will truly feel like it is in true bliss! The scent is an added plus, mine smelled like roses. The razor is quickly and easily activated by a little water. No need for any cream! I received this razor through a program run by Gillette Venus, and I was pleased to know that it was definitely worth trying out. I just can&#x27;t believe that this was the first time I tried this product. As for the cost/money portion of this product, the blades can be a bit expensive but they are totally worth the money if you like your legs to feel taken care of. My legs truly felt like I had just been to a spa or had gotten a massage. The packaging and overall friendliness of the product are also very good. It is easy to use and made very nicely to appeal to anyone and everyone that uses it. Everyone that I have recommended this product to has enjoyed it thoroughly and we all will continue to buy it over and over again.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a program by Gillette Venus.  I liked the razor for a women&#x27;s \\&quot;intimate parts\\&quot;  It was the perfect shape and size.  It was also a smooth shave.  It was too small of a razor for my legs as I am used to using the bigger Intuition.  All in all I did like it, but not enough to purchase again.</li>
    <li> All girls know that shaving can bothersome at times (even though it only takes about 5 minutes) so we want that razor that can provide smoothness and cut those baby hairs off in one swipe. Well look no further! The Venus &amp; Olay Razor is my new go to razor and here&#x27;s why. The packaging is a little bulky but that&#x27;s fine as it comes with 5 small razors and an Olay moisture bar on the top and bottom of the razor. These moistures give your legs that smoothness while the small blades cut off those teeny tiny hairs. You need not use shaving cream as this razor shaves off your hairs like a dream. Lotion is not necessary as the bars give you smoothness. Thus, this razor is your one stop shop as it quickly cuts hairs while giving you those sexy, smooth legs that will all need for summer!</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me this razor as part of a program, and I absolutely love it. I&#x27;m always skeptical of products that say you don&#x27;t need shaving cream,  as I have fairly sensitive skin, but you really don&#x27;t with this. I can&#x27;t tell you how awesome that is!</li>
    <li> Seriously I&#x27;ve been a fan of Venus for a very long time nothing else can compare to it, and trying this for a few times has become my new favorite razor. Easy to handle and leaves you feeling so silky smooth. I recommend this one to all those busy mommies out there to make you feel so confident.</li>
    <li> I got a free razor from a program run by Gillette Venus. The razor is Venus &amp; Olay in Sugar-berry, I love the smell of the sugarberry and smooth moisture bars.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first razor I have ever used, and the only razor i&#x27;ll ever use. A++ Venus and Olay!</li>
    <li> The Venus &amp; Olay razor left my legs feeling silky smooth without the after shower itch. I love that I didn&#x27;t need to use shaving gel with the razor because it saves shaving time. The range of motion of the razor is great, glides over knees smoothly. The razor is a bit bulky, the Olay bars on each side make it a bi big for some hard-to-reach places. The handle on the Venus &amp; Olay razor is great, padded and easy to grip. I would recommend this razor to friends and family. Great product!</li>
    <li> The packaging was okay, I have seen a lot better from Gillette but I do like the color of the razor. As for the razor itself I would like to see an upgrade on the design as it looks like any other Venus product. After using this my legs felt so smooth and silky, I barely had to use lotion after I was finished! After shaving for one day my legs were still very soft on day 2 and only required a touch up. There is not much of a sent to this product but I prefer it that way! Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> I got this razor by via a program run by Gillette Venus, love how silky my legs feel after! only thing is cannot shave my underarms but love how my legs feel after.. I do recommend to people who have dry legs! olay is wonderful, i already use their body wash and now i have 2 in 1!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually don&#x27;t spend much on razors (this one is pricey, but I received it through a trial program) and I typically buy the two blade disposables, but this razor may have changed my mind. Whether in the shower or needing to quickly shave my legs in the morning before wearing my favorite dress, this razor doesn&#x27;t require shaving cream or lotion after shaving. Perfect for anyone who doesn&#x27;t make shaving their legs a top priority and usually ends up shaving on the go.</li>
    <li> i received this razor though a program with Gillete Venus. First thing that caught my attention was that i did not need to use shaving cream, which is a definite plus for e because i have sensitive sin and some shaving creams can give me reactions. the smell is great and i have not had one single cut since using the razor. really liked the results, my legs are smooth and don&#x27;t flake afterwards like they do with most razors. overall i give this product a 9.</li>
    <li> The razor was provided via a program run by Gillette Venus. I enjoyed this razor. the best part was that it made my skin smooth.</li>
    <li> Unboxing: The Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Razor came in three parts: 1. The razor attachment, 2. the handle, and 3. a little holder to suction on a bathtub tile wall or mirror. The package was fairly easy to open and didn&#x27;t have me fighting plastic. I was greeted by the pleasant strawberry scent of the razor, which is individually packaged. The handle tip locks into the razor and is light weight and easy to control.&lt;br /&gt;During use: After the moisture bars are wet, the \\&quot;gel\\&quot; makes shaving a breeze due to the fact that I didn&#x27;t have to lather up with shaving cream. The strawberry scent is also very nice. I was a little worried of razor burn or accidentally cutting myself if I didn&#x27;t get it wet enough, but once the gel bars were wet, it was lathered enough to easily move to the curves of the legs and give a VERY close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After use: I have used the razor for a little over a week now. Since using it, I have shaved once every 2 days. Sometimes I can stretch it to 3. The razor has given me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall review: I would give this 4.5 stars out of 5. Overall, I LOVE this razor. It makes shaving quick and easy. I am a big fan of \\&quot;2-in-1\\&quot; and this definitely fits the bill. It is very moisturizing and my shave lasts a few days. The only thing I did not like was that after a few strokes, the gel would create a \\&quot;lather\\&quot; and the texture was similar to slobber when I pulled it away from my legs. Not nice to look at and strange to get use to the consistency, but I can get past it because it gives me super smooth legs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long will it last? I predict that the cartridge will last maybe about a month with frequent use. After my week of shaving, there has been a noticeable difference in how much gel is left. I also noticed that the gel is on the front and the back of the razor. I am not sure what will happen once I use up all the gel in the front. Maybe I&#x27;ll carefully rub the back on my legs to lather?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This was sent to me by Gillette Venus. I was not paid to review this product. This review is 100% my honest opinion.)to me by Gillette Venus. I was not paid to review this product. This review is 100% my honest opinion.)</li>
    <li> I loved this razor!!! The smell of it was amazing and very refreshing. Unlike most razors I have tried, this shave lasted twice as long as normal razors do. I definitely recommend everyone to try out this razor you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> I got to try this as part of a free sample giveaway that Gillette had. This was better than any razor I have ever used and my legs are smoother longer. I would recommend to everyone. The blades start shaper longer!</li>
    <li> i loved this razor. ive always been a fan of venus so when they mixed it with the conditioning factors of olay...i couldn&#x27;t stay away. worth the purchase! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not normally a fan of razors. I have used Nair and waxing for the past couple of years simply because it&#x27;s easier. No razor can last for more than a day and leave your legs feeling smoother than silk, right? Wrong! When I was offered to try Venus and Olay Sugarberry razor as part of a promotion I was hesitant but I must say I was impressed. After eagerly ripping open the sparkly magenta package I tried the razor right away because, A. It was too cute not to and B. I sort of wanted to prove to myself that all that waxing pain had not been in vain. Sadly I was wrong, why on earth have I not been using Venus razors all of this time!? It&#x27;s easy to use and seriously leaves your legs feeling fantastic! The best is that it actually lasts! It&#x27;s been three days and i&#x27;m still stubble free. So if you want a razor that actually works and doesn&#x27;t leave you lathering you dry stubbly legs with lotion for the next few weeks try Venus Olay Sugerberry! Seriously, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This product was provided to me via a promotion through Gillette and I am overall satisfied with this razor. I enjoyed the Olay moisture bar along with the 5 blades it was very convenient not needing shaving cream. I recommended this razor to my friends and coworkers because it was so convenient and being a nurse and a new mommy I&#x27;m always on the go. The razor left my legs silky feeling and took so much less time!</li>
    <li> I really am pleased with this razor I got from a program thanks to  Gillette Venus of course it is not perfect don&#x27;t know if there will ever be the perfect razor but definitely works great for me I love the extra silkiness on it makes it so I don&#x27;t have to use any shave cream which is very convenient and works great leaves my legs for soft and smooth and gets close only complaint really is that the bar of soap/silk stuff seems to come off pretty fast otherwise very pleased another good job I love venus razors good value as well not too expensive and always good coupons!!</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about the Venus and Olay razor was the delicious Sugarberry scent which I just couldn&#x27;t get enough of. Ordinary razors don&#x27;t come in scented forms, so this was a nice added bonus. After obsessing over the scent, I noticed the handle of the razor and the comfortable grip it provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used to razor to shave my annoyingly prickly legs I was quite impressed. I have thick, black leg hair that are very stubborn, so I was excited when this razor gave me great results. I got a very close shave and my legs felt soft and smooth to the touch. The shave lasted me a good two days, which is very impressive because of my rapid hair growth. I also liked the fact that I didn&#x27;t need to add shaving cream or soap to create a smooth canvas for the razor to glide over, thanks to the moisture bars. I did not see a huge difference in moisture after using the razor. Yes, my legs did seem smoother and a bit more hydrated, but this wasn&#x27;t very long lasting at all. I still needed to add a moisturizer to keep my legs from getting too dry. I expected the moisture bars to moisturize well, so I was a little disappointed. One of the greatest downsides of this razor is that the moisture bars run out very fast. After a week of usage, the bars were very close to being gone. I wish the bars lasted longer because they really are useful. The razor is still usable after the moisture bars are gone, but a shaving cream is needed to replace them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I enjoyed using this razor and am very likely to use it again. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor was provided to me through a program run by Gillette Venus.</li>
    <li> I love this new Venus &amp; Olay razor, I will never go back to any other razor. To top it off I don&#x27;t need to spend my money on shaveing cream no more. It easily shaved my legs nice and smooth, plus it doesn&#x27;t leave my legs with razor bump the day after. I say for every woman out there this is the razor for you.</li>
    <li> I was chosen to try the Venus Razor w/ Olay from a program ran by Gillette. I loved the razor. It left my legs silky smooth. I had the best shave I think I have ever had. I loved the razor. I have already purchased replacement razors for this handle.</li>
    <li> I am in complete love with the venus &amp; olay razor i would definitely recommend this razor to anyone it leaves your skin feeling so soft its amazing.</li>
    <li> I received this razor to try from a  promotion run by Gillette,  and I would say that I can&#x27;t be happier. I love the fact that I don&#x27;t need any sort of shave gel or cream,which is really awesome because I have sensitive skin and it works perfectly. I have been using this for about a month now and I am still as in love with it as I was on day one.  it is definitely by far the best razor I have used in a long time.  it&#x27;s great,  don&#x27;t think twice before purchasing it,  you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor. It made my legs so smooth. This razor was provided by a program ran by gillette for free. I would definitely buy the razor. I would also recommend this product to anyone looking to have their legs silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> Venus &amp; Olay  have made a great razor!&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was easy to open and the colors were bright and inviting.&lt;br /&gt;The Olay strips have a wonderful sugarberry scent that was refreshing and sweet.&lt;br /&gt;My skin was left smooth, silky and moisturized. I would highly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> Venus &amp; Olay Razor really gave me a close shave with all of the 5 blades. The hanger for the shower was very convenient and works good by holding the razor perfectly. Having Olay with it leaves a layer of moisture after shaving so my legs aren&#x27;t left dry and flaky like other razors. I would recommend this to my friends! I usually cut myself multiple times with other razors but this razor doesn&#x27;t tear the skin. It is gentle on your skin but has no problem removing hair. I love that I can use it more than 3 times and the razor is still sharp enough for a smooth shave! Definitely a go-to product!</li>
    <li> This was a whole new experience for me! Usually I&#x27;m one to use those cheap two blade razors.. But when I got my hands on the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay razor.. I must say I was in shaving heaven. It was such a quick, fast, &amp; SMOOTH. Shaving experience. My legs have never felt so soft after shaving. And not to mention the smell is delicious! It makes me just want to eat it!</li>
    <li> I received the Venus &amp; Olay razor yesterday in the mail via a program run by Gillette Venus, well today was the day I tried it! And for once I can say my legs have never been this smooth, I simply love the fact that no shaving cream is required, nor does it leave a sticky feel when shaving. They are serious when they talk about a close shave FIVE BLADES, YES FIVE BLADES for a close up smooth shave, the razor glides so gently on your skin, makes less of a worry about having nicks, or razor burn! Even had my fiance try it with his stubble on his face, and BOOM silky smooth! The scent smells amazing, very sweet and enchanting. I wouldn&#x27;t let the size of the cartridge get to you, its a very decent size compared to previous attempts made by other companies with the no shave mess! I love the fact that the handle won&#x27;t slide out my hand, its got a super comfortable grip to it. Fits perfectly in your hand when shaving. Price wise, if purchasing the usual razor &amp; shaving cream, it runs you about the same price for a refill! Also remember there will be NO MESS with buying a refill, so in my book its well worth it, not to come out the shower looking like a snow man. It really is simply the best, I absolutely will be recommending this too all my girlies. Best product by far to help get you ready for shorts, skirts &amp; tanks!</li>
    <li> I really like this razor. It gives a very clean shave. It&#x27;s very convenient to have a moisture strip along with the razor.</li>
    <li> I love my razor. I was in a rush this morning and after I got out of the shower I realized I needed to shave and had little to no time. I used this razor for the first time. It was smooth, moved with my skin, and didnt leave itchy skin. I juat believe that the Olay part will disspate easily.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor! I love that it made my legs very silky and smooth! I loved how it took me half the time of other razors because I didn&#x27;t have to use shaving cream. The only drawback is that the bars only lasted me about 2 shaves.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this razor via a program run by the company. The thing I liked most about this product was the close shave. I really felt that my legs were smooth, and I didn&#x27;t even have to use any extra shaving cream or lotion. The packaging, as mentioned before, was a bit excessive, however. It probably could have been done in about 1/3 of the packaging used. Regardless of this, I really liked the way my legs felt after, as well as the \\&quot;Sugarberry\\&quot; scent. It reminded me a lot of a smoothie. The only major complaint I have, however, is how quickly the shave bars run out. I used the razor for about a week, and the bars were almost completely gone! For a razor like this, they should last much longer. It helped that the razor still worked perfectly fine after the bars were gone, but I did need to add some shaving cream (I have sensitive skin). Overall, this is a really good product, and will prove to be a staple for the summer season.</li>
    <li> I just got the Venus &amp; Olay sugar berry sent razor shipped to me for being a part of a program ran by Gillette Venus, and I must say its the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used! It has 5 blades so it gets a closer shave that has lasted me two days so far! I absolutely love the sent of the Olay bar and how smooth it makes my legs feel. Not having to buy or use shaving cream anymore is a great plus for me. I would recommend this to anyone that shaves. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more blades to continue the use.(:</li>
    <li> This razor I never doubted and after using it im glad I didnt. This is the best razor out there to use. No razor burn, no bumps, no cuts, just silky smooth lavishing legs. My newest and only favorite razor!</li>
    <li> I just got my Venus &amp; Olay Razor in the mail. As soon as I opened up the box. And seen my Venus &amp; Olay Razor. I was so happy and ready to try Venus &amp; Olay Razor. So I went into the bathroom. I wanted to try the Venus &amp; Olay Razor out on my legs first. . So I put some water on my legs. Than I put Venus &amp; Olay Razor under the water to get it wet. Placed the razor at the bottom of my leg. As I slowly went up my leg. Venus &amp; Olay Razor made shaving my legs, nice &amp; easy. Plus with the Olay added to the Razor made it fast &amp; I didn&#x27;t have to use shaving cream either. Which is so great. Now my legs are nice, smooth &amp; soft. I&#x27;m telling all my friends about the Venus &amp; Olay Razor.</li>
    <li> This razor is by far the best razor I have ever used. The five blade technology leaves my legs super silky smooth, and I know that this razor will never leave me with any nicks. The lotion bar is also very effective, and if you&#x27;re in a hurry, you could definitely skip moisturizing after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;My one problem with the design is that the box is very excessive. The design is not eco friendly whatsoever, and the scent is very artificial. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I looove the scent, but I can tell it&#x27;s just a bunch of chemicals. I would love to see a razor this effective that&#x27;s also eco friendly.</li>
    <li> I love the how soft it makes my legs feel. It gives a great close shave. The smell is awesome too, I know some people didn&#x27;t like it, but I thought it was a nice plus. Over all it&#x27;s great and gets the job done without hacking up my legs :)</li>
    <li> I used the Venus &amp; Olay Razor that I received from a program run by Gillette Venus. My first impression was that the packaging was a bit overboard, but it was easy enough to open. The razor handle itself is contoured and comfortable to use. I&#x27;ve used other Gillette products before and I love how Gillette blades are so easy to attach and remove; this product was no different. The smell wasn&#x27;t fabulous, if there was one aspect I could change it would be that. It might work for pre-teens but I personally don&#x27;t want to be smelling like a strawberry shortcake. I would buy this product after this razor is worn out but I would likely choose a different scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience shaving was amazing though. I am the biggest klutz when it comes to cutting myself while I shave and this product is nearly foolproof. It allowed me a quick and thorough shave with beautiful, soft legs afterward. Even sensitive areas like my inner thigh are perfectly smooth which is a miracle! Absolutely no razor burn or bumps after using this product. I would definitely recommend this product though to anyone who wants smooth, moisturized legs with no nicks!</li>
    <li> When I was accepted into a program run by Gillette Venus to try the Venus &amp; Olay Razor, I could barely contain myself until the package arrived. I immediately tore open the packaging - which by the way was very easy to open and probably the best by far in its design - and was welcomed by a strong strawberry scent. I loved the aroma of the razor! While shaving my legs, I noticed the razor glided very smoothly and it was easier to guide than my last razor. I love the hook for my shower, it was very convenient and cute! I would DEFINITELY recommend to a friend and try this razor again - I love it! The only aspect I did not like was the soapy, slimy bar. It made my legs smooth, however it&#x27;s a bit too slimy. Nothing&#x27;s perfect, but this razor is the best in the disposable category. After I finished showering, I noticed the razor gave me a closer shave compared to my last razor and there was no need for lotion! All in all, it was a very good experience.</li>
    <li> I loved receiving a Venus and Olay razor from Gillette in the mail and was super excited to use it. The smell was amazing and left my legs silky smooth. I tried to shave my bikini area with it and it was slightly awkward because of the size, but overall still did a good job. The only problem I had was when I went to buy refills..... a whopping $15 for 3 cartridges, yikes. I will recommend this product to my friends so they can have summer ready legs too. I would also advise Gillette to try and lower the price and if that&#x27;s not an option, they maybe some amazing coupons every few months :)</li>
    <li> I received this Venus &amp; Olay razor through a program run by Gillette Venus and I thought the Venus &amp; Olay razor was great! It&#x27;s an extremely close shave and left my legs feeling very silky smooth. Not to mention that the Sugarberry moisture bars smell AMAZING. The moisture bars also made my legs feel very moisturized even after I got out of the shower. The only negative thing that I thought about this razor was that after one time shaving my legs and armpits the moisture bars significantly went down. Other than that I thought this razor was excellent and I would definatily recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> I love this razor for the simple fact that my legs feel awesome after shaving. I just want to keep shaving even when i don&#x27;t have hair lol.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved trying this razor out!! excellent product and I have nothing bad to say about it! Ladies wear those dresses and show off those lovely new shaven legs!! Thanks for giving me my free razor from the Venus &amp; Olay campaign!!</li>
    <li> I really like the scent of this product. It makes your legs super soft and helps moisturize them so you can skip lotion if you&#x27;re in a hurry. I received the razor through a program run by Gillette Venus.</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a program run by Gillette Venus, and while I thought that the razor did a good job, I felt that the Olay part (the stuff surrounding the razor) left my legs feeling like the hadn&#x27;t been washed. Like that weird residue that gets left behind. I would probably purchase a Venus razor, but maybe not paired with Olay.</li>
    <li> As a mom of a toddler who takes showers during short naps or on rare occasions where I have help in the day, I don&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;luxurious&amp;#34; shower experience often.  I seized the opportunity to try the new Venus &amp; Olay Razor in Sugarberry when I was given the chance to try it through a program run by Gillette Venus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m rating this razor three stars because even though it gave me some nasty razor burn on my legs, someone without sensitive skin may not share this experience.  It also works better than any other razor I&#x27;ve tried for underarms, and the Olay soap is silky enough that my underarm skin actually feels noticeably softer after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Five blades is not a marketing ploy - this is truly one very close shave!&lt;br /&gt;-Works off the same handle as all other Venus razors, so you don&#x27;t need to buy a new razor to try the blade&lt;br /&gt;-Shaving was quick and easy - perfect for those on a time crunch.&lt;br /&gt;-Even with the Olay bars, the razor is sleek and natural to grip - no bulk.  It contours to the natural curves of your legs without nicks on ankles or knees.&lt;br /&gt;-Soap smells great, is silky, and goes well onto skin without need for extra lathering.&lt;br /&gt;-Soap bars last a long time and dry out well between showers, so you don&#x27;t lose your soap while you&#x27;re not using it to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-If you have sensitive skin, be prepared for the razor burn of a lifetime if you don&#x27;t add shaving cream or another lubricant. Even with extra soap, I still got razor burn on my calfs and the less fleshy parts of my legs. I have no issues with other five bladed razors, so I have to assume it&#x27;s that delightful Sugarberry that&#x27;s irritating the skin.&lt;br /&gt;-The blades themselves dull pretty quickly, and replacement blades are pricy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t continue using this razor for my legs until Gillette comes out with a Sensitive Skin version (please, Gillette?), but I will keep it simply because it is so fabulous for my underarms. For someone like a mom of young kids, this razor means actually having time to shave and properly groom!meone like a mom of young kids, this razor means actually having time to shave and properly groom!</li>
    <li> I recieved this razor from a online company that lets users review products.This razor is very good for shaving the legs,armpits..Not so good for shaving bikini area,but that is to be expected because of the bars being much larger then some of the other venus razors.Overall this razor does smell very good,It gives a smooth silky shave.No nicks or cuts at all.Very good razor.I will keep buying products from venus.</li>
    <li> This razor was provided via a program run by Gillette Venus. I have used razors that are very similar to this one as in you don&#x27;t have to use any shaving cream and this one is by far the best. The handle fits perfectly in your hand and the olay bars keep your silky smooth!</li>
    <li> I would absolutely recommend this product. I have very sensitive skin and get razor burn easily. This razor left my legs smooth with no red bumps or ingrown hairs. They also left my legs feeling smoother longer (5 blades enable a super close shave.)</li>
    <li> The idea is great not having to use any shaving cream get a quick nice shave however it is not good if you have sensitive skin, I was looking forward to using this product but then it gave me razor burn on my legs maybe if they had a sensitive skin one it wouldn&#x27;t but at least for me it caused razor burn :(</li>
    <li> I love the moisture bars that come with this razor. They really help make my legs smoother. One thing I didn&#x27;t like too much was that the moisture bars didn&#x27;t last very long. I shaved both legs (ankle to mid-thigh) and the moister bar was almost gone. I loved the way my legs felt though afterwards and it did smell great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used and loved the original Venus razors for years, so when Gilette offered me the opportunity to test out a new type of Venus razor, I was both curious and skeptical. I didn&#x27;t really think anything could be better than the original, especially a scented razor (I have sensitive skin)--but as it turns out, the Sugarberry scent is delightful and non-irritating, and this razor does in fact improve on the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those moisturizing shave bars do more than just eliminate the need for shaving cream (which is super-convenient on its own, let me tell ya!). They also leave my legs super smooth and sleek, and not dry at all. If you have dry skin then you know shaving can be a drag (literally), but this razor made smooth work of even delicate spots like my knees, ankles and bikini line. I never felt dry and I felt like the risk of nicks really went down. Further--this razor gave me such a smooth shave, I was able to go an extra day between shaves. Total win, especially now that summer is here and I&#x27;m extra-busy. I don&#x27;t need to waste extra time in the shower when I could be hitting the beach!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that the razor doesn&#x27;t contain the most natural of ingredients. So, if you&#x27;re trying to find natural products, you&#x27;d be better off purchasing a separate shaving cream with a standard razor. It just depends on how natural you want to go; I usually don&#x27;t worry that much about shaving creams since they don&#x27;t stay on the skin. I should also note that this razor may not be cruelty-free, since Gilette does do some animal testing.</li>
    <li> The moisture bars get very slimy &amp; goopey for my taste. However, they do an excellent job at prepping and hydrating the skin. It&#x27;s kind of a bitter sweet reaction. I love love love the blades. The razor has 5 blades so you get good exfoliation and a super close shave. It has been almost a week and I am just noticing stubble. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Yes! Amazing The new Gillete Venus &amp; Olay razors are fantastic !&lt;br /&gt;The blades remove hair in one quick swoop and the Olay smooths in lathers as you go ,No need for shaving cream because the olay bars on the razor take of that,after drying my legs off they felt silky in smooth as if i had just used some really expensive moisturizer..Great product highly recommended .</li>
    <li> I have wanting to try the Venus &amp; Olay razor to see how it worked. I was provided this razor via a program by Gillette Venus and I&#x27;m glad i got to try it! It was a pleasure to use this. The scent smelt like fruit candy. It was great not having to use shaving cream, just rinse the bars and start shaving. The razor just glided on the skin that it almost felt like I wasn&#x27;t shaving at all. The moisture bars were amazing. You really feel it moisturizing your legs leaving them silky smooth. I also loved the fact that it came with a holder for the shower.</li>
    <li> Love this! After trying the Venus and Olay razor in sugarberry that I received from a Gillette Venus program, i thought it was gonna be the same as all the other razors ive used but i was wrong. It works great and im loving the five blades.I did not once cut myself and the razor glided along my legs smoothly and removed my hair with one swipe, I didn&#x27;t have to go over and shave spots again. It left my legs so smooth after ward, and id have to say that the Olay moisture bar smells great! The only thing is that with Olay bar i guess you don&#x27;t need  shaving cream, the bar worked great i just wish it had more of a lather but then again that&#x27;s how i like mine.Overall i had an amazing experience with the Venus and Olay razor and definitely will be purchasing when needed!</li>
    <li> My legs have never been this smooth for this long!  The only downside was that the bulk of the blade made it slightly difficult to shave under the arms.</li>
    <li> I received the Venus &amp; Olay Razor in Sugarberry for free via a program run by Gilette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the razor, I could not believe how silky smooth my skin was. I&#x27;m very lazy and rarely shave with shaving cream. I used the razor sans shaving cream and was very impressed. The five blades provide a quick and painless shave while the moisture bars protected my legs from razor burn. The only downside is that with such a large razor head, it was difficult to shave effectively and without razor burn around the curves, corners and harder-to-reach areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this razor, especially to those who are low-maintenance.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving my legs are so sensitive, but after I was introduced to this product and received Gillete for free provided by a program run by Gillete Venus my opinion on shaving has changed. Even from the start I fell in love with the packaging, what girl wouldn&#x27;t love the pink glittery sparkles. The experience was overall good it got every hair with each stroke, no more going over the same spot twice. In addition to smooth legs, the sugarberry scent made my legs smell delicious. I didn&#x27;t even have to put on lotion afterward.</li>
    <li> So I got this through a program run by Gillette Venus. It says that it will \\&quot;help lock-in moisture\\&quot; while shaving. I think it does. The shaving was very smooth. I normally have to use shaving cream or I get major razor burn. With this one, I went without shaving cream and only had a little razor burn towards the end of my shave. So my first leg has no razor burn at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell was nice and not overwhelming. I have really bad allergies so I stay away from products with very strong scents because it makes me sneeze like I&#x27;m sitting in a pile of dust. This one didn&#x27;t affect my allergies at all which is a major plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My legs are normally really dry after any shower no matter what I use. I just have naturally dry skin. This totally helped. My legs are less dry than they would normally be. I&#x27;m planning on buying more cartridges when the one I have gets dull. The price is definitely not as bad as I thought it would be too!</li>
    <li> First off I must say I usually use Venus razors religiously because I have very very sensitive legs, I can&#x27;t even use shaving cream because it irritates them so bad I break out into a rash...for days! ICK! But VENUS has always pulled through for me so THANKS VENUS!! Also with the \\&quot;moisturizing bars\\&quot; I was a tad skeptical at first, but boy am I glad I tried it, and the lovely scent of \\&quot;sugar berry\\&quot;. The first use of the razor I felt a significant difference right away, I could feel how smooth my legs were as the razor just glided on my legs, so smooth I bugged my boyfriend for about an hour after I shaved them to feel them because they were THAT smooth! I&#x27;m glad it came with a shower hanger that actually sticks, my poor other one is about done for. As I was shaving the moisturizing bars were coming off with a slime and I was getting a bit worried that it would irritate my legs, and it didn&#x27;t! WOO-HOO! I will say I will be purchasing this from now on, along with my other Venus razors because even with the moisturizing bars it didn&#x27;t bug my legs and that couldn&#x27;t make me happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS VENUS!...AGAIN</li>
    <li> This razor is so convenient. I am always out of shaving cream and out of time, so this product is ideal for me. I was able to try it out through a promotion from Gillette and I am a huge fan now. The moisture strips last me for a few shaves, and the razor lasts longer. I sometimes put a bit of my own shower gel on my legs to make up for the lack of moisture strip (although this isn&#x27;t necessary for the first few shaves). All in all, a great product. It is more expensive than other razors, so I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy them all year, but it is a necessity during the summer months :)</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a program run by Gillette Venus but I am not required to write a review. I want to share my amazing experience using this razor with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this razor today for the very first time and I loved it! It was packaged nicely (in a sparkly pink container) and easy to open (pull apart the backing). I did not use any soap or shaving cream, just the razor itself which has an Olay bar on the top and bottom of the blades. The razor glided so smoothly and left behind a smooth and radiant glow. I did not need to go over the same area since this razor got the job done the first time. I LOVE IT! I will be purchasing this razor along with cartilages from now on.</li>
    <li> * The Venus and Olay Razor is great! After using it for the first time i fell in love. My legs have never felt so soft and smooth, for the first time in my life i felt sexy and i actually want to show my legs off. I tend to get clogged pores but this razor got ride of this problem. My legs are radiant and I can&#x27;t stop touching them.&lt;br /&gt;*My Venus and Olay Razor was run by Gillette Venus. I am greatly thankful for this product because it cleared my legs and some of my insecurities with my self image. Every women should own this razor because it is life changing, i love it and now it&#x27;s your turn to try it.&lt;br /&gt;***** The Venus &amp; Olay Razor smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave the stinging after shave affect on your skin. Before this razor I used to get razor burns but that&#x27;s all different now. And it gets ride of the smallest most finest hair on your legs, you can and will be confident about your legs after trying this product, i guarantee it!</li>
    <li> I was given a chance to try the Venus &amp; Olay(tm) Razor by a Gillette Venus program. I think the razor was an interesting concept, but not completely practical. The razor has a comfortable handle; and the Olay moisturizer bar certainly moisturizes while also having a pleasant smell, but the pros end there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor gets a decently close shave, but nothing you couldn&#x27;t get from a cheaper razor. Its large bulky head does not make for easy maneuvering and the slimey Olay moisturizing bar disqualifies it from being a travel razor.I got about 5 shaves out of the moisturizer bar, I had expected more based on the size of the razor cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dwarf lime tree in our house constantly attracts fruit flies and unfortunately one of the flies got stuck to the Olay moisturizer bar and died. That silly surprise was easily fixed with a little water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I feel like it&#x27;s a cool concept for a razor but it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I received my Venus &amp; Olay razor free courtesy of a Gillette program and it is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used since I began shaving. My legs were so soft after shaving and they stayed soft long after shaving as well. It was the cleanest shave I&#x27;ve had and I didn&#x27;t even need to use shaving cream! The only downside to it is having to replace the blades but it&#x27;s worth the price. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this razor for every woman to try.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to try this product free of charge through a trial program offered through Gillette Venus. These are my thoughts on the razor after using it for about a month:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The razor was easy to hold, the sugarberry scent smelled very nice and the included suction cup made the razor easy to hang in the shower. The moisturizing bars left a \\&quot;slime\\&quot; on my legs that prevented any nicks or razorburn and the shave was so smooth I was shocked to see hair on the blades--it hardly felt as if the razor had done anything. Very nice. As someone who is often too lazy to use shaving cream, the moisturizing bars are a huge plus. Usually I slather lotion on afterward to reduce the stinging, but I didn&#x27;t have to with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The moisturizing bars are considerably worn down, even though I&#x27;d only used the razor about six or seven times. I don&#x27;t shave every time I&#x27;m in the shower but when I compared the level of smoothness I got between the Venus razor and a generic triple-blade razor, I couldn&#x27;t see a difference in the results, making me less likely to pay much more for a five-blade razor. The moisturizing bars were nice to prevent nicks in the shower, but I still felt the need to put lotion on my legs afterward. I felt that my legs were not sufficiently moisturized from the Olay moisture bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give the product 4/5 stars. It provided a really nice shave but for me I think the price point is too high when I can use a generic for similar results.</li>
    <li> I got the razor from a program ran by Gillette Venus. I admit I was skeptical at first. I heard of razors that leave your legs moisturized and tried some, but that tiny little gel strip lasted only for 2-3 shaves. This one lasts for a weeks. Also it really does moisturize the legs. I would not replace this razor with lotioning your legs after shaving, but it does stop your legs from looking like gator legs after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;And my favorite part is that my legs do not itch after shaving when I use the Venus &amp; Olay razor. I hate itchy legs, and this is the only one that I have ever used that does not leave my legs itchy.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I gave it four star is bulk. I feel that is would be harder to store the razor head when it comes to time to replace them. I keep mine stored under the sink, but bathroom space is already cramped, so large razor heads could be a problem when it comes storing them until used. Other than that its  a great product!</li>
    <li> I have a beauty channel on YouTube (youtube.com/michesomu), and this was my review on the Venus &amp; Olay razor by Gillette! Feel free to check out my video for a much more detaied review :)&lt;br /&gt;So here are my opinions...&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;-The shaving experience was great. The moisture bars really aided in a moisturized shave and it glided nicely across my skin.&lt;br /&gt;-No shaving cream needed!&lt;br /&gt;-The sweet smell makes me want to eat the razor! ;p&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;-The moisture bars don&#x27;t last too long, therefore it limits the longevity of the razor (you have to purchase refills more often than a razor without the moisture bars)&lt;br /&gt;-The price for the refills is $15.99 for 3 cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product for free via a Venus &amp; Olay program, but I am not being paid to do a review. The review is my honest opinion :)</li>
    <li> I was chosen to receive the Venus and Olay Razor through a program run by Gillette Venus.  I used the razor in the shower and the Olay moisture bars provided so much lubrication for my legs that I didn&#x27;t need to use shaving cream.  After shaving, the razor left my legs so smooth with a super close shave.  After, I didn&#x27;t even have to apply lotion to my legs.  The shower hook provided in the packaging was very convenient and adds a great feature to the razor.  I would recommend this razor to any woman who hates using shaving cream and wants an all-in-one razor!</li>
    <li> Omg I loved this razor it smelled so good and when you use itit&#x27;s like the olay scent comes off and it leaves your legs smooth and clean feeling I wouldn&#x27;t ask for a better razor there wasn&#x27;t a single thing I didn&#x27;t like about this razor the blades cut every hair I went across loved it not really a hairy person tho.</li>
    <li> First off, the sugarberry scent is one of the greatest scents I&#x27;ve ever smelled in the hair removal industry- fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this razor does an amazing job of moisturizing while still providing a close shave. I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the results, mainly because I love a good razor that allows me to skip a few days of shaving during the week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall is that the band of Olay around the razor is really sensitive to moisture, and despite newly installed ventilation, my bathroom definitely holds moisture. Especially given living right on Lake Ontario, the humidity is out of control in this area. The band of Olay disintegrates relatively quickly, and causes a bit of a sticky mess. Nothing that isn&#x27;t easy enough to clean up, but it would be nice if the benefits of the Olay cream lasted for the duration of the razor head itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the best of the moisturizing razors we&#x27;ve seen thus far. This is highly influenced by how much I love the sugarberry scent, but that&#x27;s fine by me!</li>
    <li> I got to try the Venus &amp; Olay Razor through a program run by the Gillette Venus company. For years, I have only used the Venus razor, but I had never used the Venus &amp; Olay razor. I have to say, after using this product, I think I will be switching to this kind of Venus razor! This razor makes my legs very smooth with the Olay moisture bars, on top of the already great shave that the five-blade Venus razors are well-known to give. I generally do not use shaving cream in the first place, I use soap, but not having to use anything on my legs is definitely a plus. Seriously, you do not have to use any shaving cream, soap, anything on your legs, and your legs will still feel soft after shaving! I have the razor in the Sugarberry scent, and it smells pretty great. I will definitely be using this razor from now on!</li>
    <li> The Venus &amp; Olay™ Razor was provided to me for free from Gillette and I gave it to my daughter to try. She loved it so much that I bought one for myself. The Olay Moisture Bars really made my legs feel soft and silky and helped the razor give me a wonderfully close shave. I have found a new brand of razor and will be purchasing these from now on. They were great!</li>
    <li> Its alright. I was able to try it out for free as a Bzzagent thanks to Gillette for supplying the freebie. I thought the moisture bar was nice as it allows you to shave without needing shave gel. I like the handle grip...it makes it easy for young girls who are new to shaving like my daughter.</li>
    <li> I love these razors! The way the razor moves so easily around knees and ankles providing a close shave on these hard to get areas! The moisturizing bars leave your skin so soft and smooth. My daughter has just started to shave her legs at these razors make it so easy for a begining shaver! We love them! Thank you Gillette for letting us try it for free! We are sure going to be using these razors from now on!</li>
    <li> I received this razor to try from Gillette, and overall I am pleased with it. My daughter loves it, and she is new to shaving. She felt that the razor was smooth and easy to use. Although I liked it, I found it a little bulky and hard to handle at times, especially when using it for my bikini area.</li>
    <li> I already have a Venus razor, and I was really exited to try this scented variety. The problem is that the scent isn&#x27;t strong enough, and the lubricating strips kind of just dissolve and fall off. It still shaves really well, but if you depend on those strips for skin protection you&#x27;re out of luck. I&#x27;m going to use the handle with my regular Venus cartridges. It was a nice idea as a novelty, but with the strips disintegrating and virtually none of the promised scent, I don&#x27;t think this product is worth it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this! It is smooth, sensitive and it does not cut her skin when she shaves. My wife recommends this because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It shaves close to your skin. Although you may not see it with a naked eye, but you could certainly feel it.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is comfortable. Overall, the shave is comfortable. Although the razor is somewhat bulky for a small hand, after getting used to it, the razor becomes just right in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;3. It smells great. With Olay Sugarberry scent, you will smell nice after the shave. Only draw back is that the strip doesn&#x27;t last long enough. But this is the case for all razor cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, my wife likes the razor despite some minor glitches (little bulky, thus little difficult to maneuver). If the price is not an issue for you, then you might want to consider this razor.</li>
    <li> My legs are so unbelievably smooth and moisturized! I was hesitant about the no shaving cream part but I&#x27;m so glad I tried this. I was given the opportunity through Bzzagant and couldn&#x27;t be happier. My legs are smooth and smell yummy, the moisture bar is still holding strong so I can use it again and because of how flexible the razor is, I didn&#x27;t miss a spot!</li>
    <li> I recently received the Gillette Venus Olay Razor as part of a campaign from Gillette. I am a long time user of the Venus Embrace and I believe  I will continue to use my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Venus Olay to be wonderful for about a week. It provided a nice smooth and clean shave while providing the moisturizing effects of Olay. However, after a few days the soap began to disintegrate. I even kept the razor in the holder provided but every time someone used the shower, it got a little bit smaller and smaller. Of course, the blades were still plenty sharp and providing a great shave so I was left in a pickle. I felt wasteful throwing it away but it was awkward to use it with the plastic soap holders hanging off the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, you will not be disappointed by this razor but I would recommend the Embrace. It lasts about 4 weeks without getting dull and stays moisturized throughout.</li>
    <li> Best razor i have ever used and it was the best shave i have ever gave myself!The smell is incredible!It left my skin feeling silky and smooth!had NO nicks or cuts and im pretty good at giving myself those but the razor slid so smoothly and gently ill never go back to any other razor!</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I tried this awesome razor it keeps my legs feeling so silky and smooth I now found my best razor never again looking for any other one this is what my skin needs.</li>
    <li> The scent alone had me sold, smells amazing! I experienced an incredibly close, smooth shave. After using this razor I didn&#x27;t find it necessary to apply my normal after shower moisturizer either. It has been several hours and my legs still feel quite refreshing and moisturized! I will be switching to this product for my normal razor!!</li>
    <li> Ok this razor is a savior seriously lol, not only did i use it on my legs i used it under my arms, some menacing hair on my arms and the dreaded happy trail. And all hair is gone just revealing the smooth skin i KNEW was there. No only is is smooth its soft and smells amazing. The only thing i didn&#x27;t like was the Olay bar got a little sticky and runny but other than that i will definitely be buying the cartridges from now on. Goodbye Nair!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when i received this product, the packaging looked so happy and girly. I received the product via a program run by Gillette Venus. I liked that they provided something to hang the shaver when your done. I was surprised at how fast it took me to shave, I am very hairy and usually take a while to catch all the hairs. The five blades made it so much easier to get rid of all of them. I liked that i didn&#x27;t need to use shaving cream and the bar made my skin super smooth afterwards. I am so happy with the results and I would recommend this product to women who are hairy and want not only nice looking skin but a smooth one.</li>
    <li> I was sent this product as a campaign by the company. I loved this razor! I felt the razor gave my legs and silky smooth, yet close shave. I loved the suction cup hanger for the shower, keeps my organized less cluttered and more organized, one less thing I have to worry about getting lost! I also loved the refreshing berry scent and recently received it so I thought it was a great scent for summer and the warmer months! I would definitely repurchased and I like how you do not have to buy extra shave gel/cream. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love the close shave and the yummy scent :)Venus is one of my favorite razor brands!!! And I love the moisture bar.</li>
    <li> My experience with this product is really good I usually have very sensitive legs when I shave they usually burn and turn red and get really itchy afterwards but with this product I got none of that it made my legs silky smooth with no irritation I&#x27;ve used this product twice once with built-in shaving gel bars in the second time with shaving gel actually on my legs and it works exactly the same I can&#x27;t stop touching my legs I can&#x27;t believe how soft and smooth they are this razor was provided via a program run by Gillette Venus</li>
    <li> I Absolutely love the Venus Olay Razor I have very sensitive skin and loved that I did not get any razor bumps. The smell is pleasant and no need to apply lotion when you get out the shower, Venus Olay practically does that for you to. You will love how O so silky smooth your legs feel every time you use this one. I will make this my new and only razor for now on.</li>
    <li> I received the Venus &amp; Olay Razor as a part of a program run by Gillette Venus. After using the shaver for several days, my overall opinion is that the Venus &amp; Olay Razor packs a typical razor with the moisturizing power of Olay, and while that&#x27;s nice, it&#x27;s not groundbreaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon first taking my razor out of the package, I found clipping in the cartridge was an easy process and the berry scent was pleasant. I later noticed that the berry scent must be in the handle, because the Olay moisturizer did not smell berry-like and the scent never transferred to my skin (I wish it would&#x27;ve).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the suction cup holder to keep the razor in my shower, and not even five minutes after I was in the shower, the suction cup lost its suction, the razor fell, and the cartridge popped out of the handle. I spent ten minutes trying to maneuver the cartridge back onto the shaver handle, worried each moment that I was going to cut myself and trying to make it work with the slipper Olay moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver shaves well, but I find the Olay moisturizer portions to make shaving your underarms difficult. The milky white portion of the Olay moisturizer was sometimes goopy when I ran it up my legs, and it created an almost mucusy portion of moisturizer as I pulled the razor from my skin. If the niche of this razor is to have the Olay moisturization, I wish they would&#x27;ve supplied something that could cover the parts of the cartridge. I don&#x27;t think the Olay portion will last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterward, my legs did feel hair-free and soft, and I&#x27;m now on day seven without having to shave again. There is no noticeable hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ll continue using my Venus &amp; Olay Razor, but I think there needs to be a few things changed to make this razor better. If the only thing differentiating it from a regular Venus razor is the Olay part, I would save myself a few dollars and just purchase a regular Venus razor.</li>
    <li> I tried the Venus &amp; Olay razor through a program run by Gillette Venus. Initially, I wasn&#x27;t sure how I felt about it because when I shaved under my arms, I had to go over the same spot a few times. However, when I got to my legs, shaving was a breeze! The razor effectively shaved off the hair without once nicking my skin. It also cut close and I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same spot on my legs more than twice. The razor smells great because of the Olay Moisture Bars. The moisture bars are a great alternative to using shaving cream. Overall, I liked the razor. I don&#x27;t think my legs have ever felt so smooth.</li>
    <li> First, my complaints:&lt;br /&gt;- I was excited about the suction cup mount, but it didn&#x27;t stay stuck in my shower. This could be because of my shower wall, so no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;- The large cartridge makes it tough to get tight spots (bikini zone--yikes!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, the razor is great:&lt;br /&gt;- The sugarberry scent rules. Summery and sweet.&lt;br /&gt;- Five blades &#x3D; super close shave. Sometimes it felt like my legs/the razor were buzzing or vibrating. I think that&#x27;s &#x27;cause the five blades were doing a lot of work on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;- It saves time to not have to lather up my with shaving cream or soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I got this razor free from Gillette Venus!</li>
    <li> I, like most women, have spent far too much on razors over the years. And what&#x27;s worse, is that all this time I&#x27;ve been buying the WRONG razor! I recently recieved the Venus &amp; Olay razor in the mail through a program run by Gillette Venus and let me just say...OH. MY. GOD. With it&#x27;s sugarberry scent, a shave with this baby is sweet in delicious in more ways than one! Its moisturizing power outshines all my most expensive razors! My absolute favorite thing about the razor is that despite being sinfully moisturizing, the head is so flexible! It&#x27;s easy to reach places like behind the knee that most razors who can claim intensive moisture make very tricky!</li>
    <li> Got this razor as a promotion from Gillette and I am really happy with it!  The 5 blades give a very close shave and my legs don&#x27;t feel as dry with the Olay moisture bars. Smells nice too :)</li>
    <li> I have always been skeptical of razors that include moisturizer or gel strips because I have dry skin and it never seemed like those little strips could do the job to make my legs smooth and moisturized. When I got the opportunity to try the Venus &amp; Olay razor through a program run by Gillette Venus, I was excited to finally put it to the test.  I use Olay face products so I was really trusting that Olay would provide great moisture for my shave. After using the razor, I am glad that Gillette teamed up with Olay because my legs are not dry at all - after a few showers, I even noticed I was using less lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with the Venus &amp; Olay razor completely changed my routine. I live in a small apartment with only a tiny shower stall rather than a tub, so usually I have to get out of the shower, lather my legs, and shave using a water basin and traditional razor.  With this razor I can shave in the shower without worrying about the water washing away my shave gel (big $ waster!) or having to get out of the shower to shave my legs, then back in to rinse off (big time waster!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Olay moisturizing strips are really smooth which makes shaving a breeze. They retract a little when I press the razor to my legs, so the blades get really close and move easily across my moisturized skin. Since I bend over completely (tiny shower stall, remember?) to shave, this helps me finish shaving faster so I don&#x27;t have to spend 15 minutes bent over, going over the same spots to make sure they were shaved. As an added bonus, the scent of the moisturizer is very light but smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one tiny complaint - rinsing off the razor between strokes seems like it uses up a little of the moisturizing strips due to the water hitting it (sort of like using a bar of soap).  This could cause me to run out of the moisturizer a little quicker and have to purchase more cartridges. Even so, I won&#x27;t need to buy shave gel anymore, so that evens it out, plus I just love the easy breezy, effective shave I get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Gillette &amp; Olay for a great product!ve the easy breezy, effective shave I get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Gillette &amp; Olay for a great product!</li>
    <li> ***This product was provided for review via a program run by Gillette Venus***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was shocked when I opened the packaging and saw how enormous the moisture \\&quot;strip\\&quot; surrounding the razor was! I expected a tiny little strip on one side or the other of the blade like all of the other moisturizing razors I&#x27;ve used in the past. Not this huge deodorant stick surrounding my blade, haha. I was definitely pleasantly surprised! I really liked that I didn&#x27;t have a need for any shaving cream because the \\&quot;strip\\&quot; would prepare my leg for the blade immediately following it. So that was a huge time saver. I will definitely repurchase this product in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why did I not give it 5 stars if I liked it so much? One word: Ankles. I found the Olay section to be to bulky for me to properly shave around my tiny ankles without risking cutting myself. Other than that I loved it.</li>
    <li> I received the razor via a program run by Gillette Venus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alright so the Venus and Olay is HUGE. The many blades did their job in resulting in a really smooth feeling, but I&#x27;m afraid the Olay part doesn&#x27;t last very long. It gets used up pretty quickly depending on how often you use it. I try to only shave like every three days or so, but I know most of my friends shave every day and in that case this would not be a very good investment. I had a lot of trouble trying to completely shave the downstairs regions so this is definitely not meant for that. Probably arms, legs and underarms only kind of product. I stopped shaving my arms though so that would help it last longer. Overall I like it, but it isn&#x27;t something I would keep investing in because I am a college student.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is convenient that I didn&#x27;t have to use shaving cream and worry about the water hitting my legs and washing the shaving cream off. This was the best part of it.</li>
    <li> I received the razor through a program ran by Gillette Venus.  And o have to say as soon as I used it for the first time I loved it my legs havent felt more smoother! I especially love that I dont have to use any shaving cream, and buy the refils in different scents! I love everything about it, also the holder !</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t really anything too special about Venus/Olay team up. They claim that you do not need to use shaving cream with this product....I completely disagree. Especially if you have sensitive, dry skin, I would definitely still use shaving cream with this razor. The two moisturizing bars are not enough lubrication. When used with shaving cream/gel, this razor works like any other Venus razor. You get a close shave, the handle is nice, etc. I do like the fragrance as well, it&#x27;s very yummy. I like this razor, it&#x27;s a change from my other Venus razors&#x27; fragrances, but nothing more than that really. It doesn&#x27;t really live up to what new things it claims to do. I was given this product through a campaign by Venus Gillette</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a program run by Gillette Venus and just to let everyone know this product rocks its awesome it kept my legs smooth and scented and I truly feel like a goddess with Venus and Olay razors. I didn&#x27;t have any nicks or cuts or any razor burns which I usually get with my own brand and I didn&#x27;t even have to use shaving cream. My husband thought the scent was perfume, loved my soft legs, my kids said I didn&#x27;t feel like a bear and my legs feel great, by the way I have ezcema and its really ard keeping my legs soft, this razor kept my legs feeling soft and silky. Overall my rating is a 5 and suggest it to all those mommys out there,and those non mommys also. I actually enjoyed shaving for the first time, thanks Gillette Venus and Olay I am definately a Sugarberry mama now! ;)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00AFCOWB6 Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Sugarberry Scent Razor 1 Kit]]</li>
    <li> This morning I tried the Sugarberry scented razor by Gillette Venus, and my legs look and feel amazing! My legs are so soft thanks to the Olay moisture bars, not having to use shaving cream is a plus. I enjoy the scent its clean. Overall great product! will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I thought the Venus &amp; Olay Razor was the perfect razor for me. It left my skin smooth and silky to touch. I was given this razor by a program run by Gillette Venus to test and review. I thought the features of the razor were good; there wasn&#x27;t anything about it that I didn&#x27;t like. The Sugarberry scent was amazing and so yummy like a yogurt. I love that I don&#x27;t have to use any shaving cream because the Olay Moisture Bars help moisturize and keep my legs from becoming dry. I spent less time shaving with the Venus &amp; Olay Razor than with the disposable razors and didn&#x27;t have to double check. I would recommend this razor to everyone.</li>
    <li> I was able to try the Venus &amp; Olay Razor by Gillette Venus.  At first I loved the razor, I didn&#x27;t need body wash like I did with other razors, and I was able to shave off 99% of the hair off my legs.  But then a few days later I tried it again.  I used the rest of the Olay strips on a second shave that was really a touch up shave. Most razor blades you can use the blade for 4-6 ties before replacing.  I have used this one twice and I need to go get replacements. I probably won&#x27;t be buying the Venus &amp; Olay Replacement Blades unless, they are on sale and I have coupons.</li>
    <li> The razor did just about everything the packaging said it would. I received mine from a Gillette Venus trial program a couple of weeks ago and have been using it ever since. It has a very sweet, \\&quot;girly\\&quot; smell, probably suitable for teens, however the smell doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin. It gave me a really close shave, and I didn&#x27;t have to use shaving creme or go over any areas twice. Also, I experienced no nicks and couldn&#x27;t feel the blades dragging on my skin. Awesome! My only complaints are that the moisture strips are bulky, making it hard to get into some nooks and crannies. Also, the moisture bars fade rather fast and are a bit flimsy. Would I use it again, definitely.</li>
    <li> First of all, I received this razor through a program run by Gillette Venus. I was so excited to get this product because I have wanted to try this razor and was tired of using extra soap. At first I loved this razor, you do not have to use shaving cream or soap due to the moisture bars, it gave a close, smooth shave and left my legs smooth all day. But now that I&#x27;ve used it for a while my opinion is starting to change. I still love the new sugarberry scent and the moisture bars, but its a little frustrating to use on those tougher to get to areas because of the Olay bars. So I have had to use a totally different razor for those areas.  Also my moisture bars are wearing down rather quickly and that&#x27;s a disappointment. Overall it&#x27;s a good razor (for legs only).</li>
    <li> ???? This product doesn&#x27;t make sense at all. I&#x27;ve had razors my whole life, and I&#x27;ve used a bunch of different brands including Venus - but this one has a movable head! It flops around while I am trying to shave the underarms! The soap smells great and the razors are sharp, but I don&#x27;t get this product at all. I have to literally pinch down the head and just move it along the parts I want shaved.</li>
    <li> Good razor like usual</li>
    <li> Fantastic razor with lovely scent. Love it.</li>
    <li> Do I really need a scented razor?  No, not really.  Still, I&#x27;ve found this to be a good and useful razor, one that has benefits beyond the scent (which seems to be promoted as the main selling point).  Basically, this is a razor that works without the need for shaving gel or similar.  All it requires is water.  The head of the razor is buffered by two large moisture strips, which activate when wet.  With just water I found that this razor glided easily over my legs and underarms.  I could definitely smell the sugarberry scent when I opened the package- it&#x27;s sort of a generic berry, bath product scent.  When I got the razor in the shower, however, I didn&#x27;t really notice the scent- that might be because the scent tones down in the water, or it could be because I&#x27;d already used scented shampoo and soap, so my nose was otherwise occupied.  In any case, the scent is not very strong.  There are only a couple of drawbacks to this product that I don&#x27;t find to be very major issues.  First, the moisture from the razor can be a bit gooey.  It does the job, but the feeling is a little gross.  I prefer the feeling of shave gel, but the convenience of this razor outweighs the texture issues.  The other issue is that without a foamy gel coating my legs, it&#x27;s more difficult to see what parts I&#x27;ve shaved and what parts I haven&#x27;t, so it&#x27;s a bit easier to miss spots.  That is a bit of an issue, but the fact that this razor is SO easy to use means that I can just go over those areas next time I&#x27;m in the shower.  Overall, I LOVE the convenience of being able to shave with just a razor and water.</li>
    <li> First off let me start by saying that I love the scent of the Venus razor. However, for the price it isn&#x27;t worth it. The moisture bar only lasts for about 3-4 uses if you&#x27;re lucky. The replacement heads are more expensive then the other Venus razors and it doesn&#x27;t last as long. I can&#x27;t tell a difference about how close the shave is either compared to other Venus producst. So for me it isn&#x27;t really worth the price.</li>
    <li> I received my Venus &amp; OLAY razor in sugarberry for free from a program run by Gillete Venus. I absolutely fell in love with the product! After spending years trying every razor under the sun I was on the verge of giving up.I was given the very rare opportunity to try their product and provide my honest opinion. I Loved it! I no longer had the very uncomfortable irritation I would always get after shaving. It was such a relief. It not only gave me a really close shave but it also made my legs silky smooth which lasted until the next day. The greatest thing for me was having the freedom to shave everyday, not every other 2 days. I recommend it to every person that has a problem with sensitive skin. The Venus &amp; OLAY razor worked great for me!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this razor, it was provided to me via a program that was run by Gilette Venus, it was actually a bit more than I expected, ina sense that it was great, it leaves the legs super smooth, it smells delicious, and it didn&#x27;t give me that after shave itch, I usually use my razors which are another kind of Venus and it usually gives me the little bumps after the shave, but this one really did the trick, it was perfect and you don&#x27;t even need to apply anything before hand, at least I didn&#x27;t have to apply anything, it was such a fast shave as well, it didn&#x27;t take long at all, and it lasts longer than other shaves, so that&#x27;s another plus!</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a program by gillette venus to try. i received it for free. initially upon opening the package i assumed it would be a pretty decent razor. after giving it a try, heres how i feel about it. overall, its a pretty good razor. you can use it either with shaving cream or without. i tried both. it also comes with this neat holder that suctions onto your shower wall, which prevents you from having to lay it down which would mess up the moisture bars. after drying off, i noted that my legs were noticeably smoother and softer than the shave i usually get from my razor, which is a Schick. the only downfall of the product that i noted was that the moisture bars get in the way of those curvy areas, such as the bikini area. it made it a bit challenging as far as that area of shaving goes. other than that im overall happy with the product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice, smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I always purchased the disposable ones because I thought they were more sanitary but they always left my legs rough and with razor bumps? After trying this product I can honestly say that is is worth it. I will be buying disposable heads of this one, once I get to walmart. I love it. The smell is awesome too. I don&#x27;t need to put lotion agter.i got it from a Gillette program and I&#x27;m glad I was part of it</li>
    <li> The inital smell once I opened the package was wonderful.. very crisp and clean smelling. I like that the razor has 5 blades and the moisture bar really helped with my sensative skin. My legs were left smooth. Bit of advice...don&#x27;t place the razor in the shower blade down. It will make the moisture pad very slimy... Let it dry pad up.</li>
    <li> this product is great! if you like silky legs and love the keep them silky smooth then this venus olay is just for you! it isgreat! there is no need to but shaving cream because this locks does it for you!</li>
    <li> This razor was sent to me by a program ran by Gillette Venus. I was already a loyal Venus customer but this razor is amazing. It smells awesome and it glides so smooth which means less cuts.</li>
    <li> I received this razor via a program run by Gillette Venus. When I first opened it the first thing I noticed was the smell;The sugarberry scent is a tab bit too strong for my taste. The razor allowed me to get a very close shave without cutting myself, but as someone who doesn&#x27;t shave in the shower I found the moisture bars to be a bit messy. Not to mention,my legs were very itchy after shaving. Although I got a nice,close shave with this razor, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many razors in my life and this was one of my favorite. This razor has 5 blades and 2 moisture bars so no shaving cream is needed. One positive is that you don&#x27;t feel the actual blades on your skin so no irritation. The hair came off in one swipe and my skin was moisturized after. I would recommend!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT LOVE THE SMELL AND QUALITY LOVE HOW SMOOTH&lt;br /&gt;MY LEGS ARE AND SO DOES THE HUBBY &amp;lt;3!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m already used to shaving without a shaving cream because I find I&#x27;m allergic to most of them; so I was excited to receive this razor through a program run by Gillette Venus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was the smell and I loved it but it does not really seem to last once you get into the shower. When I started to use it I really enjoyed it, it wasn&#x27;t leaving my skin dry and I was not having any horrible reactions to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second day using it I found that the soap bars tend to drip a lot and I feel like it was starting to clog up the razors making them slimy. This is when I also noticed that the soap bars already appeared smaller than during my first use. I don&#x27;t store my razors in the shower so it wasn&#x27;t due to them constantly getting wet or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third day I used it the same thing happened with the second day. It also appeared as if I wasn&#x27;t getting that close shave I got the first day either and it was even sort of patchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed this razor when I first used it, I thought of even switching over because I loved the fact my skin wasn&#x27;t dry. I find if I did switch over I&#x27;d constantly be buying new heads because the soap seems to go buy fast.</li>
    <li> First of all I always use this brand of razors because I have really sensitive skin and this one is the only one that doesn&#x27;t give me a rash. I loved the smell and the fact that you don&#x27;t need shaving cream because of the Olay moisture bars. The only issue is that I couldn&#x27;t seem to get the holder to \\&quot;hold\\&quot; the razor in the bathroom, it always fell out.</li>
    <li> I received this razor via a program run by Gillette Venus. The packaging is very appealing and feminine. When I used it for the first time, I was very happy with the results. I usually end up using men&#x27;s razors because they get a closer shave than most razors for women. I only had to shave each leg once, not go over and over it like with other razors. Plus, it had a appealing smell that wasn&#x27;t too overpowering. My legs felt much smoother and softer after using this. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Im giving this razor 4 stars because although it worked great, was a close shave and the bars helped make sure there was no nics, it gave my legs terrible razor burn. My legs arent usually so sensitive to things, but this just didn&#x27;t work for me. other than that its a great razor! if you are sensitive though, watch out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different razors and none have left my legs as smooth as the Venus &amp; Olay razor! I think the moisture bars really do make a difference and will definitely purchase extra cartridges once I use this one up!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is also a plus!</li>
    <li> I recieved my free razor through a Gillette Enid program! The sugarberry scent is a little sweet, however the smell does not stick to our skin after rinsing. The five blades gave me an ultra close shave however it did cause my sensitive skin to become itchy, probably because of its exfoliating feature. I love the play moisture bars, it left my post shave legs feeling silky smooth! The included shower mount was a bonus feature to this razor and I love that I don&#x27;t have to take up a shelf in the shower for my razor  when not in use. The moisture bars glide easily across my skin and adjusts to my curves while shaving! I would totally recommend this product to a friend!!</li>
    <li> Venus &amp; Olay(tm) Razor is one of my favorites!  First off, it smells amazing! It is the perfect girly smell. It is easy to use and only need one glide to get your legs or underarms smooth and hairless. It feels like silk as it glides on your skin. One thing that is most important is that I DO NOT get flaky after a shower now that I use this. I always got dry skin so that was a great plus! The design is cute and the wall attachment stays on the shower wall. The olay bar keeps my legs smooth and soft and I barley get cut! I would recommend this to anyone! This razor was provided via a program run by Gillette Venus, thank you!</li>
    <li> I received this razor to review and I had an excellent experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the fact that the cartridge was bigger than most razor I&#x27;ve used it was a good product. The 5 blades really do work well and my skin was so soft after I used the razor. The better part is that you don&#x27;t really have to use shaving cream because of the moisture bars, and they really do leave your legs smooth afterwards. The smell is also very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the price of the cartridges but besides that it&#x27;s worth a try. Would recommend!!</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a program run by Gillette Venus.  I have used it multiple times and it still shaves as well as it did the first time!  I found the Sugarberry scent  pleasing, not too overwhelming or \\&quot;teenager\\&quot; like. The moisture bars are awesome because I can cut out the extra step of shaving cream, while leaving my legs silky smooth without needing lotion after. I do wonder how long the moisture bars will last, but I have been using it for about 2 weeks and there is still a lot left. The razors are a bit expensive, but so far it has really exceeded expectations compared to the usual disposables I use. It has also lasted longer and still shaves as good as the first time. You definitely get your money worth.</li>
    <li> Gillette&#x27;s Venus &amp; Olay shaver is amazing, it doesn&#x27;t even feel like you&#x27;re using a razor. Thanks to a program run by Gillette Venus, I had the opportunity to use it for the very first time and I realized what I was missing. I will be Gillette&#x27;s number one customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in very pretty packaging that was very easy to open. This package included a cartridge, a razor handle and a stand with a suction cup so it can hang in the shower. The cartridge  has five blades along with two moisture bars around it. Because it had moisture bars there was no need for any shaving cream and the 5 bars gave me a close shave. The razor handle was comfortable because of a gel like feel, that enabled me to have a good grip on the handle. The stand was a plus because  i could just leave it in the shower, however the stand did not stay o the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall my shaving experience was incredible I was able to do my legs, arms and underarms with it. I still have moisture on the cartridge left so the product is long lasting. My mother touched my arm and said that it&#x27;s \\&quot;Smooth as a Baby&#x27;s Bottom\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Gillette!</li>
    <li> Thanks to a program run by Gillette Venus, I received the razor complimentary and I am now a Venus &amp; Olay razor user for life! It provided a smooth and close shave and had an amazing smell. Even during a quick shave there were no nicks or cuts. No shaving cream is also a plus, without shaving cream a generally annoying task becomes a breeze. I don&#x27;t have to moisturize as much thanks to the Olay moisture bars. The only downside to this razor was the moisture bars lasted a little bit shorter than other Gillette Venus moisture bars, but this small problem is easily masked by all the benefits. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a smooth and easy shave.</li>
    <li> If you are anything like me and dead shaving your legs because you are in a rush in the morning this product is for you. I loved how I could use this product without a cream or gel! It left my legs feeling silly smooth and fresh!</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a program run by Gillette Venus. This razor concept is awesome. The Olay part makes your legs feel super smooth and soft after shaving, even with just water and without shaving cream. The only reason I cannot give it 5 stars is because the Olay strips do make the whole thing rather large and difficult to maneuver in some places.</li>
    <li> Got this razor via a program run by Gillette Venus and turned out to love this product! I have sensitive skin and still did not get any razor burns from it. I did not even have to use shaving cream which was awsome for people who are constantly on the run. I would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> I was sent the Venus &amp; Olay(tm) Razor via a program run by Gillette Venus and was thoroughly impressed with the product. I tend to bounce around between razors, but I think moving forward I&#x27;ll end up purchasing the Venus &amp; Olay(tm) Razor. The specific features that I enjoyed about this product are as followed:&lt;br /&gt;- the design was compact and not too bulky, as some competitor razors with the built in can be&lt;br /&gt;- I received the sugarberry scent and it smelled delicious. It left me feeling like I practically didn&#x27;t need to use body wash!&lt;br /&gt;- the Olay Moisture Bar creates a thick foam and allows you to not have to use shaving cream which I think is fabulous! Any time I can save in the shower-- I like to!&lt;br /&gt;- the venus handle fits any other venus razor so that&#x27;s a plus&lt;br /&gt;- the razor gave a great shave and left my legs really smooth. Often times with the first few uses of a new razor, I tend to nick myself but this razor was gentle and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I had was that the shower hook didn&#x27;t work properly and kept falling down which was a bit frustrating. However, when it came to the actual razor, this one is gets an A.</li>
    <li> I received this razor via a program ran by Gillette Venus and I have falling in love with this razor!!  My boyfriend always complains about my prickly legs so I shaved using the new Venus &amp; Olay razor without telling him, as we sat on the couch he couldn&#x27;t help but notice my silky smooth legs!  The only thing I have noticed is how fast the moisture bars disappear , other then that a great razor for all your shaving needs!</li>
    <li> I received this razor from a program run by Gillette Venus to try out. I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about a week now and I can definitely tell that my legs feel smoother after a shave. I had previously been using the Gillette Venus Disposable Tropical Razors, which just feature three blades, and Skintimate shave gel in Raspberry Rain. With the Venus + Olay razor, there is no need for shaving cream. Just run the moisture bar under the water for a second and then you can start shaving. The moisture bars make for a very smooth and close shave, and I have yet to cut myself at all, even around my ankles! I know I&#x27;ve used a razor in the past that had a moisture bar and it left a strange film on my legs, but this one doesn&#x27;t at all. My legs feel silky and smooth, almost as though I applied lotion to them. The moisture bar seems like it will last a while...I&#x27;ve used it probably five times already and have yet to notice any real wear to it. You should always hang it on the shower hook so it dries properly. If you lay it on the side of the tub or something, the moisture part of it tends to stick to ceramic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product and will probably buy a new set of cartridges once this one is used up. It&#x27;s just so much easier to use this than to have to lather up in shaving cream and then shave. Plus, my legs feel smoother with this than my old razor anyway!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this razor. I had been buying the cheap store-brand razors (usually 3-bladed) and could immediately tell the difference after using this razor. The 5 blades make for such a smooth shave and I didn&#x27;t have any nicks either! Also, my store brand razors usually last less than a week, but this razor has lasted a week and a half thus far- gotta love the longevity! The only downside was it was a little awkward to maneuver at times since the blade apparatus is big, but otherwise, a great razor! (I received the GILLETTE® VENUS &amp; OLAY(tm) RAZOR for free via a program run by Gillette.)</li>
    <li> I was provided this Venus &amp; Olay(tm) Razor in Sugarberry via a program run by Gillette Venus, and I was so excited to try it out! The packaging was attractive, with the razor blade packaged in a smaller container inside the bigger package with the razor handle and the shower holder. I was glad that Gillette Venus included this shower holder in the package, since I usually toss my razors back into my shower caddy or onto the edge of my bathtub to dry, so the holder is definitely a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impressions of the razor:&lt;br /&gt;I read other reviews that stated the Sugarberry scent was too sickeningly sweet for them even while opening the package, but I only caught a whiff of the scent while opening the package. The scent isn&#x27;t an important factor for me when using a razor, since I&#x27;m in the shower anyway, but the sugarberry scent was light and refreshing, almost like a shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two lotion bars above and below the blades flex forward and back when being used, which gives you the ability to go around curves and hard to reach places. I wet my legs and the razor to activate the lotion bars and the blades glided very smoothly over my skin without any tugging. I was able to go behind and over my knees without any problems, thanks to the pivoting head of the blades and the flexible lotion bars. What I realized was that I couldn&#x27;t rinse the blades like how I usually do after every few strokes to get rid of the hairs in the blades, since this would cause the lotion bars to melt and would go to waste. What I did was to slightly rinse the razor from behind the blades to get rid of excess hair, which helped slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall impression:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great razor with great moisturizing abilities. The blades glided over my skin smoothly and the lotion bars provided my skin with protection from nicks and cuts. The shower holder is a plus, along with the soft handle which provides easy grip. The scent is a nice addition, but isn&#x27;t a huge factor for me since I would be rinsing my legs off anyway. My only gripe for this product is about the rinsing of the blades due to the lotion bars--ironically, while the lotion bars are the best features of the razor, it deters me from rinsing the blades too much as the bars will melt away. But overall, this is one of the best razors that moisturizes your skin while you shave!r me since I would be rinsing my legs off anyway.

    <li> This razor is great! I used tp be skeptical of paying more money for a quality razor, especially the ones with the soap around the edge. I then used to use the Intuition razor, but have found this Olay has already stayed sharp for longer, and gives me a better shave. I am able to actually get my knees smooth without cutting them up! I never knew Gillette made women&#x27;s products but this one is above my expectations. I wish the soap around the blade lasted longer, but a customer service rep told me the soap lasts about as long as the blade does - so you avoid safety issues by using the blader for too long. Smart! I would recommend this to anyone, especially people who are sick of the shaving cream/dull razor/cuts all over shenanigans!</li>
    <li> I have always purchased GIllette Venus brand razors so when I have the opportunity to try the VEnus and Olay razor in the new sugarberry scent I was so excited!! I received the razor through a program run by Gillette. I thought the razor was amazing, I loved the scent and how moisturizing the bars were.i did however think that the bars didn&#x27;t last as long as some of the other GIllette venus razors, the bars lasted about 5 shaves and if you shave everyday or every. Other day that could get quite costly! I did think the bars were also a bit softer in texture and a lot bigger/bulkier than usual! But overall I&#x27;m a fan and will probably keep purchasing</li>
    <li> It is fantastic it made my skin feel silky smooth! It is amazing how well this works!! I will continue to use Venus Olay Sugarberry Razor</li>
    <li> This razor was given to me by a program hosted by Gillette Venus. I am so glad I signed up because I plan to repurchase this razor. The moisture bar is the most amazing part! Most razors will burn my skin if I do not use a shaving cream. This razor needs no shaving creme! The shave left my skin smooth and pain/ nick free.</li>
    <li> This Razor was provided for free by a program run by Gillette Venus.  I am not required to write a review and all thoughts are my own.&lt;br /&gt;Lets start with I love my Venus razors I love the shave I get from them.  The packaging was attractive (Ok I love the glitter I am a girl), with the razor blade packaged in a smaller container inside the bigger package with the razor handle and the shower holder.  The sugarberry scent, well I fell in love.  It is sweat and perfect for summer though you really don&#x27;t smell it seeing you are in the shower surrounded by your body wash and shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion bars flex well making it just as easy to get a close shave as any other Venus razor and as usual the handle is interchangeable with all other Venus replacement blades.  The bars get slimy and disappear quite fast.  I hung the shower hanger on my bathroom mirror and kept the razor there so the bar would not wash away while my husband was taking his shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor left my legs smooth and soft.  I could even skip my lotion on my legs.  Being 7 months pregnant this really put this razor on my good side. I will be sticking with this one for the remainder of my pregnancy even though they cost more then other refills and do not last as long with the bar washing away.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor holds up to its promises and can save you a good amount of time while giving you the same quality as the shaving cream razor, lotion routine dose.  I wish that the bars on the razor would last longer.</li>
    <li> i love this razer so much its the best im glad i tried it now im ready for the summer dress to come out so i show my smooth lags</li>
    <li> I got to try the Venus &amp; Olay Razor thanks to a program run by Gillette Venus and I was really excited to see if it works as promised. It was in sugarberry and the smell was great also the razor and the holder look nice. I was a bit nervous to shave without any shaving cream but I wet the razor and tried it. I noticed that you have to put it at a bit of an angle to get the white bars to touch your skin correctly (or if you turn the razor around and use the back side of the white bar on top of the razor)other wise you don&#x27;t get the easy glide of a razor. I don&#x27;t think I got as close as a shave with it, maybe because of the bars? Also I see the problem of the razor outlasting the bars by a few shaves.  Moisture bars did help as I noticed that the skin on my legs do feel silkier but again I didn&#x27;t get that close shave I like. Overall this did cut down on the time of shaving but the drawbacks out weigh the good things about the razor. I don&#x27;t think I will be switching razors any time soon.</li>
    <li> I got this razor as a part of a Gilette campaign. I was skeptical at first because I have used razors with built in shaving cream before, and they did not provide enough lubricant to shave without upsetting my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this razor for about a week, and the moisture bars are holding up very well. It moisturizes my skin very well and gives me a close shave without irritation. I like being able to just pick up a razor and shave without having to lather up shaving cream. I will be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor! The cream on either side of the FIVE blades keeps your skin both moisturized and smooth. As always, the Venus has the closest shave I&#x27;ve experienced, with five blades and no irritation whatsoever! Also, I am guilty of not always grabbing for shaving cream, enter this razor!! No need for shaving cream!! Overall I love it and will be repurchasing!!</li>
    <li> Great razor.  Smells so good.  I love how soft and silky smooth my legs are.  My mom loved it too!</li>
    <li> I received this free product from Gillette to test it out,  I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked. The Olay Moisture Bars completely eliminate the need for soap or shaving cream. This makes it great for a quick razor-burn-less shave. The only down I have with the concept is the soap bar drying a bit between shaves.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a free sample through a program by Gillette Venus. Previous to receiving this sample, I would not have purchased this item, but it is well worth it. This razor makes shaving quick and easy! No shaving cream required? WHAT? Yes, this is my favorite part about this razor, as well as the pleasing fragrance of the olay bar, and the neat shower hanger. I would definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I very greatly enjoy using this Gilette Venus&amp;Olay razor. The package is very bright and eye catching. The scent is Sugar Berry, it is very sweet, summer smell. That had me interested in the product before I had even tried it yet. Once I did I liked it even more. The soft Olay Moisturizing strips keep your legs silky soft and very moist. The 5 blade razor cuts extremely close to the skin Sioux leaving a single nic, scratch or bump. Unfortunately with many other razors I have experienced razor burn, but luckily not with this product. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the outcome of having shiny, silky soft summer legs to show off at the pool, beach and around town! This is a must buy. You will be extremely satisfied! I guarantee you that!</li>
    <li> If your reading this; thinking about trying it...BUY IT!! You can probably get it cheaper if you print out an online coupon or get a $3-$5 off coupon in the newspaper and look for sales. It&#x27;s deft a great smooth have; no left per hairs after one swipe; no kicks or cuts and glides smooth around curved areas. (Underarms,knees) do not keep in shower or keep wetting the razor the Olay moisturizer  will rare off very quickly and then you have to use having cream but not a problem; razor lasts a long time :)</li>
