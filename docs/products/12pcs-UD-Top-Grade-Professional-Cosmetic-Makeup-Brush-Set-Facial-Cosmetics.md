      <li>These would make a great gift for a makeup novice who wants to experiment with brushes.</li>
      <li>Really soft and beautiful.</li>
      <li>They are soft to the touch, attractive, and apply makeup well.</li>
      <li>Plus the box they come in can be reused because it is a cute little box also perfect for travel</li>
      <li>The brushes are cheaply made and smell strongly of chemicals.</li>
      <li>Im happy with my brushes, they arrived earlier than the were suppose to, and each brush still came wrapped in plastic covering.</li>
      <li>However what I did notice is they are cheaply made.</li>
      <li>Otherwise made good, soft hairs.</li>
      <li>The smell when you first open them though is fairly strong but the brushes are again really great</li>
      <li>Shipping was pretty fast- a lot faster than originally said, they are nice.</li>
      <li>True to picture.</li>
      <li>but this one definitely beats them by a long shot, the brushes are amazing my eyebrows are very happy hahaha</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s honestly not as bad as people are making it out to be.</li>
      <li>I loved the brushes just like how I expected to be soft and so cute to carry in my purse adorable.</li>
      <li>item arrived quickly and as described</li>
      <li>highly recommended this ladies I totally love it.</li>
      <li>I am very excited to begin using my new brushes.</li>
      <li>and the price was so cheap than what I saw on sephora&#x27;s website but was told it&#x27;s not the real thing.</li>
      <li>The handles are cheaply made but the actual bristles are nice and very soft.</li>
      <li>The box came a little beaten up but the brushes are beautiful and so soft!</li>
      <li>Brushes came packaged well, exactly like in picture.</li>
      <li>My package comes exactly how the picture is shown.</li>
      <li>but when I opened it, it smelt funny.</li>
      <li>They came in one week after I purchased then I was so happy to get them , way earlier than expected !</li>
      <li>However, I am a broke college student, thus knock off brands for now are totally fine, especially for $15.</li>
      <li>I all ready started using mine.</li>
      <li>If you are going to spend money on make up brushes, buy the real thing and spend the money.</li>
      <li>I do really like the brushes</li>
      <li>Product is good quality but slow shipping</li>
      <li>So, the reviews that I had read before buying these brushes are true, they definitely have a nail polish remover scent to them.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to buy these brushes.</li>
      <li>Bristles are very flimsy and shed frequently.</li>
      <li>Only giving 4 stars because I highly doubt authenticity...meaning, I don&#x27;t think they are genuine Urban Decay.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re so soft!</li>
      <li>They are so soft and packaged neatly !</li>
      <li>Odor is a little strong, smells like chemicals.</li>
      <li>Whether these are really Urban Decay or not, they are high quality.</li>
      <li>They smell weird, like a hazardous chemical.</li>
      <li>Blends extremely well, I recently got a new brush set</li>

    <li> Nice brush set at an affordable price with cute packaging.  Only giving 4 stars because I highly doubt authenticity...meaning, I don&#x27;t think they are genuine Urban Decay.  If that doesn&#x27;t bother you, go for it!  These would make a great gift for a makeup novice who wants to experiment with brushes.</li>
    <li> Im happy with my brushes, they arrived earlier than the were suppose to, and each brush still came wrapped in plastic covering. Highly recommend to buy these brushes. I all ready started using mine.</li>
    <li> They smell weird, like a hazardous chemical. The brushes are nice though.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very nice but they smell like toxic chemicals. Almost like soaked in gasoline or motor oil.</li>
    <li> I loved the brushes just like how I expected to be soft and so cute to carry in my purse adorable. highly recommended this ladies I totally love it.</li>
    <li> Product is good quality but slow shipping</li>
    <li> Took forever to arrive.  But they are really nice</li>
    <li> The brushes are great! Really soft and beautiful. Very happy with this product. The smell when you first open them though is fairly strong but the brushes are again really great</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use this babies! They&#x27;re so soft!</li>
    <li> The box came a little beaten up but the brushes are beautiful and so soft!</li>
    <li> These are not authentic urban decay. The brushes are cheaply made and smell strongly of chemicals.</li>
    <li> Blends extremely well, I recently got a new brush set but this one definitely beats them by a long shot, the brushes are amazing my eyebrows are very happy hahaha</li>
    <li> My brushes only took 11 days to arrive so that&#x27;s a plus. I did notice an odd smell but it&#x27;s honestly not as bad as people are making it out to be. It&#x27;s not very strong and it doesn&#x27;t smell dangerous people in other reviews are being over dramatic, wash them one time and they&#x27;re fine. However what I did notice is they are cheaply made. They are not real urban decay but I don&#x27;t care about that. The handles are cheaply made but the actual bristles are nice and very soft. Plus the box they come in can be reused because it is a cute little box also perfect for travel so your brushes don&#x27;t get messed up. I do really like the brushes but they are smaller than I thought they would be. Other than that, no complaints.</li>
    <li> item arrived quickly and as described</li>
    <li> Ok. Two of my brushes already broke :/</li>
    <li> Im very happy these brushes, they are very soft. The size is perfect portability tin case is included.</li>
    <li> They are just ok. Definitely fake Urban Decay.</li>
    <li> I really love these brushes I&#x27;ve had them for a while now and the still are great</li>
    <li> Bristles are very flimsy and shed frequently. Although this pack provides a variety of brushes, I don&#x27;t recommend them</li>
    <li> Brushes came packaged well, exactly like in picture. Great product. Great brush set.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I thought it was the real urban decay and the price was so cheap than what I saw on sephora&#x27;s website but was told it&#x27;s not the real thing. The brushes looks good on Amazon but when I opened it, it smelt funny. I haven&#x27;t used it and I don&#x27;t plan to because I am not sure if it&#x27;ll cause an infection or something. Maybe I could have the kids use it to paint water color paints or something. I do not really recommend it. If you are going to spend money on make up brushes, buy the real thing and spend the money.</li>
    <li> So, the reviews that I had read before buying these brushes are true, they definitely have a nail polish remover scent to them. I plan on washing them with johnson&#x27;s baby soap to reduce it, however. The brushes are extremely soft and come carefully packages individually, which I like. Do I think it is actual Urban Decay? No, I don&#x27;t. However, I am a broke college student, thus knock off brands for now are totally fine, especially for $15. I am very excited to begin using my new brushes. My package comes exactly how the picture is shown. Best part is, I got them within 12 days, when I wasn&#x27;t supposed to get them until June 11th. Ordered on May 17th and had arrived on May 29th.</li>
    <li> I got these brushes for my sister for her 17th birthday, and she uses them every day! They are soft to the touch, attractive, and apply makeup well. Whether these are really Urban Decay or not, they are high quality. I would recommend to any makeup-loving girl or woman.</li>
    <li> They came in one week after I purchased then I was so happy to get them , way earlier than expected ! They are so soft and packaged neatly ! My mom is gonna order some soon she loved them !</li>
    <li> They had a terrible product smell. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again but the case to the brushes are really cute and could be used for something else. Don&#x27;t think they were really urban decay.</li>
    <li> Shipping was pretty fast- a lot faster than originally said, they are nice. Obviously not a real urban decay product, but I knew that before I ordered them. Odor is a little strong, smells like chemicals. Otherwise made good, soft hairs.</li>
    <li> Friend loved it. Nicely packaged. True to picture.</li>
    <li> Very nice set great buy</li>
