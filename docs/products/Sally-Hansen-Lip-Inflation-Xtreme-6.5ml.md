### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This product is great!</li>
      <li>Hanson lip plumper is the best by far.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Sally Hansen Lip Inflation for years and it works the best out of all the lip plumpers I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>LOVE!!!</li>
      <li>Beautiful color.</li>
      <li>Touch of great color.</li>
      <li>but I wasn&#x27;t too happy with it.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great, in terms of moisture, as soon as it&#x27;s off your lips</li>
      <li>It is shiny and great color.</li>
      <li>Feels great going on, not sticky.</li>
      <li>good amount of product in the tube.</li>
      <li>This product is so good.</li>
      <li>but its a really good product.</li>
      <li>Loved this.</li>
      <li>i like the tingle and it taste good too...</li>
      <li>Love this product,  not sticky , love the shine ,perfect for day and or evening!</li>
      <li>LOVE!</li>
      <li>LOVE!</li>
      <li>LOVE!</li>
      <li>I have used this lip plumper for years and love it!</li>
      <li>but I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>The Sally Hansen lip inflation line is my favorite!</li>
      <li>my lips looked plumped up( in a nice way ) when i tried it for the 1st time.</li>
      <li>Plumps up the lips and has a nice cinnamon taste.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s nice.</li>
      <li>Nice shine.</li>
      <li>Nice Cinnamon- Citrus &#x27; zing&#x27; to it.</li>
      <li>It also has a very good taste and at first might sting</li>
      <li>It has a strong cinnamon flavor, but plumps up your lips nicely without looking unnatural.</li>
      <li>I would buy this again :)</li>
      <li>I love the tingle and the plump it gives my lips.</li>
      <li>Okay, I guess.</li>
      <li>this is okay for now though Thank you</li>
      <li>The product is okay -</li>
      <li>I love the tingle and the color</li>
      <li>But, feel and look OK.</li>
      <li>Feels wonderful when you apply it -- lasts a long while too.</li>
      <li>And the shiny coat is always perfect for either bare lips or on top of any other product.  </li>
      <li>It is the most reasonably priced lip inflation that works.  </li>
      <li>a good lip gloss, little sticky ..but no plumbing.</li>
      <li>the first time I used it I got the tingle sensation but after that one use, nothing.</li>
      <li>It does condition very well as well!</li>
      <li>As someone who easily carries a minimum of 10 different lip glosses, lipsticks, lip balm&#x27;s, etc.</li>
      <li>Also, it is half the price of this and the taste is nice.</li>
      <li>Use with caution since it makes your lips super fragile to hot food or drinks!</li>
      <li>I did not see much plumping but did feel lots of tingling.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>I really like it because it plumps and moisturizers.</li>
      <li>Yes it does sting, but I don&#x27;t feel it really plumps your lips at all.</li>
      <li>when you put it on and they are right, it is more of a clear with the tiniest hint of pink</li>
      <li>, I have to say that I will go out of my way to do whatever it takes to make sure I always have my Sally Hansen LIP INFLATION EXTREME on me at all times!  </li>
      <li>This product gives me a slight plump and it leaves no discomfort or pain which I love.</li>
      <li>Works better than most expensive plumpers.</li>
      <li>It does plump your lips at first, but as your lips get more use to the product, it just appears as if your wearing sheer pink lipgloss.</li>
      <li>I wish that it plumped a little bit more than what it does.</li>
      <li>Not crazy about the tiny application brush.</li>
      <li>bought 12 because the stores I normally buy it from said it was discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have an NYC lip plumper that does slightly plump your lips, and it keeps them moisturized for hours, even after it has fallen off, and makes your lips look better if used daily.</li>
      <li>To be perfectly honest I use it to burn a new lipline just outside of my real one - after a few months it looks completely natural no matter what lip stuff I wear (usually a pink tinted lip balm)</li>
      <li>Need to reapply frequently though</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that during the cold winter, lip plumpers work great at keeping your lips moisturized for long periods of time.</li>
      <li>but when i applied, its actually almost clear color</li>
      <li>This &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34; burns your lips so you can barely wear it.</li>
      <li>If you buy the extreme lip inflation, it really does work.  </li>
      <li>this really works, but i have to say i have had other that works the same way, so its not mind blowing</li>

<li> Sometimes it is difficult to find</li>
<li> Not much color transfer with this and TERRIBLE taste!</li>
<li> I have tried a lot of lip plumpers and some are so uncomfortable and painful!</li>
<li> Maybe I got a bad batch.</li>
<li> Now about this product, for starters I find the taste horrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> a good lip gloss, little sticky ..but no plumbing. A very little change in the cupid&#x27;s bow that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Product arrived EARLIER than expected.  I can show off my plump lips to my boyfriend. YAHOO!!  Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I used to like this for some reason but I see why they stopped selling it in stores. Use with caution since it makes your lips super fragile to hot food or drinks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this. They don&#x27;t sell it in Australia anymore so here I am, buying it and paying the shipping on amazon. Addicted. To be perfectly honest I use it to burn a new lipline just outside of my real one - after a few months it looks completely natural no matter what lip stuff I wear (usually a pink tinted lip balm)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found that during the cold winter, lip plumpers work great at keeping your lips moisturized for long periods of time. Now about this product, for starters I find the taste horrible. Like burnt plastic or something like that. Maybe I got a bad batch. Yes it does sting, but I don&#x27;t feel it really plumps your lips at all. It just looks like any other lip gloss out there. In terms of shine it&#x27;s great, in terms of moisture, as soon as it&#x27;s off your lips the moisture is gone. I have an NYC lip plumper that does slightly plump your lips, and it keeps them moisturized for hours, even after it has fallen off, and makes your lips look better if used daily. Also, it is half the price of this and the taste is nice.</li>
    <li> Yummy stuff.  Feels wonderful when you apply it -- lasts a long while too.</li>
    <li> If you buy the extreme lip inflation, it really does work.  I put it on every night and morning.  You have to let it dry before adding lip stick.  It is the most reasonably priced lip inflation that works.  It also has a very good taste and at first might sting but you do get used to that and I don&#x27;t notice stinging anymore.</li>
    <li> Temporary but can feel it work - Looking for a darker color this is okay for now though Thank you</li>
    <li> Loved this. And it works.</li>
    <li> i like the tingle and it taste good too... i just dont know why i cant buy it at my local stores...?</li>
    <li> Love this product,  not sticky , love the shine ,perfect for day and or evening! Anyone know where to still get it ??</li>
    <li> It does plump your lips at first, but as your lips get more use to the product, it just appears as if your wearing sheer pink lipgloss. Oh well. good amount of product in the tube.</li>
    <li> makes your lips a little dry</li>
    <li> Nice Cinnamon- Citrus &#x27; zing&#x27; to it. Lips stay pouty for about 4-6 hrs. Lips stay moist &amp; shiney.&lt;br /&gt;Not well for the extreme lip plump that some may want.</li>
    <li> This product is so good. my lips looked plumped up( in a nice way ) when i tried it for the 1st time. The only down side is that,it looks pink in the package but when i applied, its actually almost clear color</li>
    <li> like the color. would definitely buy it again. used this brand before in another color and decided to try this one.</li>
    <li> I have tried some of the most expensive lip glosses and plumpers on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Sally Hanson lip plumper is the best by far.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 12 because the stores I normally buy it from said it was discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has become my signature kissing potion. Guys ALL say they don&#x27;t know what it is about my kissing but they get \\&quot;addicted\\&quot; to my charm.&lt;br /&gt;The look, feel and taste is all perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Do not stop making this product.&lt;br /&gt;Linda</li>
    <li> Not much color transfer with this and TERRIBLE taste! IT does the job minimally. I did not see much plumping but did feel lots of tingling.</li>
    <li> Not any inflamation I could see.  But, feel and look OK.</li>
    <li> As someone who easily carries a minimum of 10 different lip glosses, lipsticks, lip balm&#x27;s, etc., I have to say that I will go out of my way to do whatever it takes to make sure I always have my Sally Hansen LIP INFLATION EXTREME on me at all times!  I love the tingle and the plump it gives my lips. And the shiny coat is always perfect for either bare lips or on top of any other product.  LOVE! LOVE! LOVE!</li>
    <li> Difficult to find in local stores so I bought 3.  Plumps up the lips and has a nice cinnamon taste.</li>
    <li> Okay, I guess. Not crazy about the tiny application brush.</li>
    <li> I have used this lip plumper for years and love it! Sometimes it is difficult to find so I rely on Amazon! It is shiny and great color.</li>
    <li> The Sally Hansen lip inflation line is my favorite! Feels great going on, not sticky. Touch of great color. LOVE!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great! It has a strong cinnamon flavor, but plumps up your lips nicely without looking unnatural. It looks pink in the tube, but when you put it on it is nearly completely sheer. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of lip plumpers and some are so uncomfortable and painful! This product gives me a slight plump and it leaves no discomfort or pain which I love. It looks really pink and I have read some reviews that say it doesn&#x27;t look like that when you put it on and they are right, it is more of a clear with the tiniest hint of pink but I LOVE IT! It does condition very well as well! I feel like it does not stay on my lips as long as other people have said but I do rub my lips together a lot so that is not the products fault. I wish that it plumped a little bit more than what it does. This is a simple plump! If you are looking for a big difference this is not the product. I would buy this again :)</li>
    <li> It tingles when applied. Not sure if it plumps but as a gloss it&#x27;s nice. I like the texture and color.</li>
    <li> This was the wrong product as I believed this to be the sally Hansen original lip inflation gloss. This &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34; burns your lips so you can barely wear it. Ladies don&#x27;t waste your time on a gloss that will only bring displease. I refuse to pass that crap on to anyone due to the harm it may cause.</li>
    <li> But that&#x27;s it. Nothing &amp;#34;inflates&amp;#34; lips in my experience and this product is no exception. Texture is on the stickier side so it lasts a tiny bit longer than a lip balm. Nice shine.</li>
    <li> the first time I used it I got the tingle sensation but after that one use, nothing. It does not make my lips plump at all trust me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Sally Hansen Lip Inflation for years and it works the best out of all the lip plumpers I have ever tried. I love the tingle and the color is very subtle and pretty as well.</li>
    <li> this really works, but i have to say i have had other that works the same way, so its not mind blowing but its a really good product.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. Works better than most expensive plumpers. Need to reapply frequently though</li>
    <li> The product is okay - but I wasn&#x27;t too happy with it.  At least, it does keep your lips moist.</li>
    <li> Prettiest pink lip ever !</li>
    <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND.I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS.  I really like it because it plumps and moisturizers.</li>
