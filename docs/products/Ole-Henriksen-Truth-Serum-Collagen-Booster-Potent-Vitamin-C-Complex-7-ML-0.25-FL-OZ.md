### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>One of the best face treatments ever</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been reading that the best type of serum to use is one with Vitamin C</li>
      <li>C is excellent for great skin.</li>
      <li>It gives my skin a beautiful and youthful glow.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>The serum is great though.</li>
      <li>great product.</li>
      <li>The product itself is a good product</li>
      <li>Good price.</li>
      <li>My skin does feel refreshed after using it and it smells good to boot.</li>
      <li>I have used the product before and loved it</li>
      <li>I love this serum!</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>It smells great and seems to work on smoothing out fine lines and giving illuminosity.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Love this for my skin.</li>
      <li>but I love the stuff.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It smells great and makes my skin glow and its not heavy at all!</li>
      <li>1st bottle was free samples, got to love it so ordered on amazon.</li>
      <li>Apply to clean face in the morning.</li>
      <li>Will be ordering a full size</li>
      <li>May have to order a full size of this soon.</li>
      <li>Face looks more vibrant.  </li>
      <li>I got my first bottle with the purchase of a Clarisonic and figured hey, it&#x27;s free, might as well try it.</li>
      <li>It appears more soft, supple, and youthful.</li>
      <li>This is a small sample and a great way to try the product without committing to $50 for an ounce.  </li>
      <li>I began using this as part of a larger skin care routine change so while I can&#x27;t say for sure that this serum is the only cause of my better looking skin, I feel like it has something to do with it.</li>
      <li>I really like this product!</li>
      <li>First thing on your skin in the morning to give it a day-long boost.  </li>
      <li>It was one third of the cost, guess I should have known better.</li>
      <li>This one is more of a jell and left my face sticky , I was looking for the oil based truth serum .</li>
      <li>There is not a warning on the label about this possibility and buyers should be aware.</li>
      <li>Even around my eyes, it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
      <li>It really helps minimize puffiness.</li>
      <li>Fast service.</li>
      <li>I love this serum, and this small, affordable bottle of it is cool</li>
      <li>I usually apply this to my damp face, right out of the shower, and then apply moisture surge over night mask from Clinique on top of this.</li>
      <li>Actually, if you do the math, you are getting 1/4 oz for 1/4 the price of a full one oz bottle.</li>
      <li>I think I like it, feels good on my skin, but it is more of the sample size :(</li>
      <li>Also the size of the bottle was so small it was more like a sample would not buy again for the price listed.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for the last 5 days and looked in the mirror to see where my huge sun spot is from the drivers window, and I had to look super hard to see where is was.  </li>
      <li>My mouth developed canker sores and I couldn&#x27;t eat any foods with acid in them.</li>
      <li>And as far as the quality: I have sensitive and somewhat oily skin, and this doesn&#x27;t irritate me or make me oilier.</li>
      <li>I used it less than a week, hard to say if its doing any good to my skin.</li>
      <li>The one I got for free was 2x this size and lasted about 7 months, so I&#x27;m guessing this one will last half that.</li>
      <li>The bottle is small, but only one pump is more than enough for my face and neck.</li>
      <li>careful to much will burn</li>

<li> However, I had a bad reaction to the amount of vitamin C in the product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was not the size the ad claimed.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! It smells great and makes my skin glow and its not heavy at all!</li>
    <li> Love this for my skin. Vit.C is excellent for great skin. 1st bottle was free samples, got to love it so ordered on amazon. Good price.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff!  It really helps minimize puffiness.</li>
    <li> The product itself is a good product but I was really dissapointed about how small the bottle was when I received it. That why I gave it 3 stars. it&#x27;s almost like a sample size. It&#x27;s only .25ounces. But I guess you get what you pay for. The serum is great though.</li>
    <li> The product works as advertised. However, I had a bad reaction to the amount of vitamin C in the product. My mouth developed canker sores and I couldn&#x27;t eat any foods with acid in them. I cut vitamin C out of my diet and changed my toothpaste, but the problem persisted. I didn&#x27;t think about this product&#x27;s vitamin C  as a cause until I went on a trip and didn&#x27;t use it for several days. My mouth improved immediately. So I discarded the product. There is not a warning on the label about this possibility and buyers should be aware.</li>
    <li> This was very different than the one I purchased from Sephora originally, different smell and consistency. It was one third of the cost, guess I should have known better.</li>
    <li> great product. Fast service.</li>
    <li> This was tiny and not worth the money. I have used the product before and loved it but this was like water.</li>
    <li> First thing on your skin in the morning to give it a day-long boost.  Follow with moisturizer/sun screen.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It smells great and seems to work on smoothing out fine lines and giving illuminosity.  Face looks more vibrant.  I do notice some sloughing of skin in the evening as collagen must be working renewing skin cells.  I had no irritation from this.  May have to order a full size of this soon.</li>
    <li> I love this serum, and this small, affordable bottle of it is cool cause I can&#x27;t bring myself to drop $55 or $78 on a larger bottle. Someone&#x27;s review said it was a rip off because it&#x27;s so small, but if you do the math compared to the larger bottle, you can see it&#x27;s actually not overpriced. And as far as the quality: I have sensitive and somewhat oily skin, and this doesn&#x27;t irritate me or make me oilier. Even around my eyes, it&#x27;s gentle. I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in my skin tone (brightness) since I started using it. A+ \\&quot;OOO-lah\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Apply to clean face in the morning. Just couple drops. One of the best face treatments ever</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Truth Serum for a couple months now.  It gives my skin a beautiful and youthful glow.  Before using this my complexion was dull and for the last decade I had small bumps on my upper lip that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of even with expensive facials, now those bumps almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ran out of Truth Serum I took a break for a couple weeks and it showed, and the bumps returned.  This is a small sample and a great way to try the product without committing to $50 for an ounce.  Actually, if you do the math, you are getting 1/4 oz for 1/4 the price of a full one oz bottle.</li>
    <li> It did not work on the hyper-pigmentation on both cheeks.</li>
    <li> I really like this product! It is much smaller then I thought so it was gone before I knew it but I love the stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I got my first bottle with the purchase of a Clarisonic and figured hey, it&#x27;s free, might as well try it. I was super sad when the bottle ran out, so I turned to Amazon for my refill needs. The bottle is small, but only one pump is more than enough for my face and neck. The one I got for free was 2x this size and lasted about 7 months, so I&#x27;m guessing this one will last half that. I began using this as part of a larger skin care routine change so while I can&#x27;t say for sure that this serum is the only cause of my better looking skin, I feel like it has something to do with it. My skin does feel refreshed after using it and it smells good to boot. I&#x27;ve been reading that the best type of serum to use is one with Vitamin C so I plan to keep using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for just a few short weeks and already I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in my skin. It appears more soft, supple, and youthful. I usually apply this to my damp face, right out of the shower, and then apply moisture surge over night mask from Clinique on top of this. Works well. I believe I&#x27;m a customer for life.</li>
    <li> this is really small but I have been using it now for almost a month and I&#x27;m not even halfway done with the bottle. It brightens my skin. I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the last 5 days and looked in the mirror to see where my huge sun spot is from the drivers window, and I had to look super hard to see where is was.  Will be ordering a full size</li>
    <li> I think I like it, feels good on my skin, but it is more of the sample size :( I used it less than a week, hard to say if its doing any good to my skin.</li>
    <li> careful to much will burn</li>
    <li> This one is more of a jell and left my face sticky , I was looking for the oil based truth serum . Also the size of the bottle was so small it was more like a sample would not buy again for the price listed.</li>
