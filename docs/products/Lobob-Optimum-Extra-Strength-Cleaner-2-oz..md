      <li>Exactly as promised, very good product!</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s nothing more to say!</li>

      <li>so I was quite thrilled when I found it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I just discovered Lobob recommended by my ophthalmologist after years using another popular brand for gas perm lens.</li>
      <li>great solution, good price, fast shipping</li>
      <li>Lobob Optimum Extra Strength Cleaner is the BEST product I have found for cleaning my gas-permeable contact lenses!  </li>

      <li>Excellent solution for folks who are sensitive to preservatives.</li>

      <li>This is, by far, the best lens cleaner I&#x27;ve found for gas permeable lenses.</li>
      <li>, this is by far and unequivocally THE BEST cleaner EVER.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using a popular mainstream name brand cleaner for my gas permealbe lenses for more than 20 years.  </li>

      <li>When I checked with my optomistrist office on what to use to \\&quot;really\\&quot; clean my gas permeable lenses, I was told to buy Optimum.</li>
      <li>Having stigmatism is a pain for getting a good contact fit, but why make it more of a pain by purchasing over price junk from the Boston company.</li>
      <li>This cleaner is recommended by my eye doctor but isn&#x27;t available in very many stores.  </li>
      <li>It seems to work fine!</li>
      <li>this product Lobob Optimum ESC is by far the best there is for cleaning my lenses &amp; keeping them clear &amp; feeling good all day..</li>
      <li>the product volume of competitors and overall is a GREAT value for the price - aside from its impeccable cleaning ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wish that it were more readily available at consistent prices but am thankful to Lobob because without the Optimum line, my contact lens wearing days would be over!</li>
      <li>We now order from Amazon when he needs more...</li>
      <li>I am so thankful that I was able to find it here.  </li>
      <li>Cleans much better than the all in one solutions.</li>
      <li>It removes the oils and gunk from lenses and makes them feel so much better.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t use anything else now, as my vision is SO MUCH BETTER with lenses that don&#x27;t have a protein build up.</li>
      <li>Labob should advertise this product more.  </li>
      <li>and I am able to see with out my glasses.</li>
      <li>Okay, I was about 15, and it has been 49 years since they were invented</li>
      <li>My conclusion was that Lobob is simply magical in getting lens cleaned.</li>
      <li>Try it - you WILL love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>My favorite of the Lobob products for cleaning GP lenses.</li>
      <li>Cleans significantly better than Bausch &amp; Lomb Boston Cleaner.  </li>
      <li>Better than baush and Lomb.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this cleaner is not for disposable soft lens</li>
    <li> I have worn RGP lenses for 25 years.  I used to use Bausch &amp; Lomb cleaners, and always needed to use enzyme tablets about once per week.  If I didn&#x27;t use the enzymes, it seemed as though my lenses would get some buildup, and would start to bother me.  Did this for years.  B&amp;L came out with Simplus, which was supposed to have enzymes in it (which didn&#x27;t work so well for me) and i was having more and more trouble trying to find the enzyme tablets, or drops.  They were also getting pretty expensive.  About a year ago I was hunting for enzymes and stumbled across Lobob.  it gets rave reviews so I gave it a shot.  The cleaner worked so well, I have switched my soaking solution and cleaner to Lobob and don&#x27;t need enzymes at all any more because my lenses never get uncomfortable.  I wish I had found this a looong time ago.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent hard contact lens cleaner.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent cleaner, since we cannot purchase the cleaner with Pepsin any longer for gas permeable rigid (hard) contact lenses. When your lenses get to the point you can no longer clean with anything, go to your lab (where you bought them) and have them use checmicals only they can buy.</li>
    <li> Works fine for my scleral lens. It&#x27;s what my doctor recommended. I have serious allergies &amp; the lens is always perfectly clean. The red warning cap is great for the visually impaired.</li>
    <li> This cleaner had great reviews and I too thought the same initially. However after a month or so of use, My contacts started developing some deposits and at one point it was one big blob which this cleaner along with the soapy solution wasn&#x27;t getting off. I tried my old boston advance cleaner and viola! it was clean the next day. So I still use it but clean with boston once a week till I run out and then I might just buy the Boston cleaner in future.</li>
    <li> Threw away all Boston and drugstore brand to use Lobob products exclusively.&lt;br /&gt;Made an immediate improvement in RGP coating problem.</li>
    <li> I have worn hard contact lenses for 50 years, and have tried every cleaner out there.  This cleaner is far superior to any other.  It only takes 2 or 3 drops per contact, so it lasts for months.  Labob should advertise this product more.  I had never heard of it until my optometrist gave me a sample.  It is impossible to find locally, so I am very glad that Amazon carries it.  Try it - you WILL love it.</li>
    <li> Great cleaner for my hard lenses. It&#x27;s been hard to find this at my local drug stores, glad I can still find this online.</li>
    <li> Yowsa...this stuff works great on protein buildup</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing gas permeable lens for a number of years and when they stopped making the enzyme tablets to remove deposits felt helpless.  I then discovered Optimum Ex-Strength Cleaner.  It by far does the best job of any  product on the market!</li>
    <li> definitely the best contact lens cleaner i have found: Lobob Optimum extra strength RGP cleaner.  one tip from my optometrist that seems to help- squirt a small amount into your storage case with the soaking solution.</li>
    <li> Good cleaner.  It gets very sudsy as it is rubbed on the lens.  I seem to have less irritation from deposits since I started using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing contact lenses for the last 50 years and have cleaned my hard lenses with every type of product that&#x27;s been on the market.  This is by far the best cleaner for my gas-permeable hard lenses.  Cleans best and doesn&#x27;t leave any irritating residue.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff! Really cleans the goo and schmutz others leave behind...(looking at you Boston and Equate!) Worth the money and the wait!</li>
    <li> When I checked with my optomistrist office on what to use to \\&quot;really\\&quot; clean my gas permeable lenses, I was told to buy Optimum. I&#x27;m glad I did!  It is a great cleaner and goes beyond my expectations. I&#x27;ve been wearing the gas permeables for many years and this is really the best product I&#x27;ve used for cleaning.  Great job and I highly recommend using it daily.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cleaner.  The stores in my city don&#x27;t carry this awesome product.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> What can I say about a contact lens cleaning solution? It works very well, and it&#x27;s cheaper than Target&#x27;s UP brand. A winner!</li>
    <li> I have used this lens cleaner for about 5 years. It is the best. It cleans extremely well with no eye irritation. And, the price is very reasonable. I would highly recommend Optimum ESC.</li>
    <li> I have tried many cleaners for my hard lenses and this one seems to do the best job of cleaning all deposits and other dirt from them with no allergic reactions.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It really cleans my gas permeable lenses as I was experiencing fog on them.  This product was recommended by my optometrist.</li>
    <li> At $9.89 a bottle for twice the amount (Boston cleaner costs this for one ounce), including super saver shipping, plus the positive reviews, I decided to try this product and have been using it for the past three weeks.  I have been wearing hard contact lenses since they first came out.  When was that?  Okay, I was about 15, and it has been 49 years since they were invented (don&#x27;t do the rest of the math).  Suffice to say that I have tried a lot of cleaning products.  The one thing that I have particularly noticed is that the cleaner takes any deposits off the lenses and keeps them clear throughout the day.  I&#x27;m so pleased with the performance of this cleaner that I&#x27;m about to order another bottle while the price is low.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing RGP lenses for almost 20 years and used Boston Solutions exclusively.  My eye doctor gave me samples of different cleaners and solutions to try.  Allergies tended to fog up my lenses after only a day of wearing them. This cleaner really worked.  It does wonders for removing protein deposits.  It makes the lenses feel \\&quot;slimy\\&quot; just like after having them professionally cleaned.    I can&#x27;t use the other Lobob solutions because for some reason my eyes are sensitive and tend to burn when I do but this cleaner is great. I use it with Alcon&#x27;s  Unique pH conditioning solution and my eyes have never felt better and my vision is so much clearer due to  clean lenses.</li>
    <li> Use this product for contact lense cleaning and you will be pleased to find out that it is the best and only product that completely cleans lenses making them so comfotable to wear!  Combine the use of this cleaning solution with the disinfecting and soaking solution for best results.  My Doctor was right .......A+++</li>
    <li> Had difficultiy finding this locally.  It is a very good cleaner.  It was a full $2 less than the only store I found it in,</li>
    <li> After wearing hard lenses for nearly 40 years, I was suddenly suffering from red, weepy, painful eyes.  My optometrist had told me he suspected that I developed an allergy to Boston solutions and told me to try Clear Care which helped but did not give me total relief.  I discovered the Optimum line by doing some online research.  My progressive RGP lenses are once again comfortable and wearable all day for 12-16 hours.  I wish that it were more readily available at consistent prices but am thankful to Lobob because without the Optimum line, my contact lens wearing days would be over!</li>
    <li> All of the Lobob Optimum products are great. I&#x27;ve been wearing gas permeable lenses for a long time, and the cleaner they are the more comfortable they are. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This cleaner is the best I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve tried them all. When combined with their other products you may rethink switching to soft lenses or getting surgery.</li>
    <li> This cleaner works very well on my bi-focal contact lenses.  I switched from another brand based on my doctor&#x27;s recommendation and it made a world of difference.  For some reason it&#x27;s difficult to find this product in stores, so I order in from Amazon for the same price including shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a popular mainstream name brand cleaner for my gas permealbe lenses for more than 20 years.  Recently, I couldn&#x27;t get my contacts clean.  Despite repeated cleanings (every few hours) and enzyme treatments (everyday), my contacts remained blurry.  Then, I read the reviews on this product and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I am so pleased.  My contacts are finally clean!  I have no blurring or build-up on my lenses.  After using this cleaner only once, my problem of blurred contact lenses was solved. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My husband has sjogrens syndrome and wears contacts specifically designed to bathe the eyes continuously...this product was recommended by his specialist and has become very hard to find at a fair price.  His contacts cover the entire eye surface and his cleaner has to not only be dependable but also gentle.  We now order from Amazon when he needs more...thanks for carrying it!</li>
    <li> I just started wearing RGP contacts a few weeks ago, and really only began wearing them regularly last week (had a few setbacks b/c of allergies and a slight corneal scratch.  If you don&#x27;t have a plunger for RGP removal, order a few, they can save you so much trouble.).  In any case, after daily wear for about a week, I still hadn&#x27;t gotten past ~2 hours of wear, until I started using the Optimum system (ESC, plus CD solution and WRW drops).  The first day I sailed through 3.5 hours of wear, and could have gone longer, but decided not to push my luck.  Since then I&#x27;ve continued to lengthen the wearing period and while I&#x27;m still adjusting to the &#x27;there&#x27;s something in my eye&#x27; sensation from the lenses themselves, I am free of other irritations I was experiencing (using Boston Advanced) and the need to instill drops every 20 minutes or so.  Still need drops periodically, but I only need to put in the WRW drops every 1.5 - 2 hours, a much lengthened interval for me.      Overall, if you have sensitive eyes or contact allergies (I am allergic to several of the quaterniums) I recommend that you try the Optimum system.  Though I have not been using Optimum long, this is the first time I have found my RGPs comfortable enough to hope that wearing them all day, every day might actually work for me.</li>
    <li> The Lobob Optimum products are really superior to other cleaners for RGP lenses.  Due to dry eyes, I have had a problem keeping my lenses clean, but this cleaner used in conjunction w/ the Optimum Wetting and Rewetting Drops has really made a difference.</li>
    <li> Hard to find this stuff these days - it used to be repackaged at Target and possibly other places. Now Target only carries Boston. Boston is all you find anywhere, for some reason. This product gets the lenses clean and they go into my eye clear every time. The Boston makes my contacts cloudy and irritated. It&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s because the lens is dirty or because my eye reacts to the solution. Whatever the case, no problems with the Lobob. I can&#x27;t figure out why stores don&#x27;t carry this superior product!</li>
    <li> I have kerataconus and have to wear hard lenses. I can only get Boston Advance or Simplus in Canada. I buy this in bulk when in States. If you wear hard lenses this is amazing.</li>
    <li> I was having problems with protien build up on my RGP lenses. The Lobob cleaner handled the issue. Contacts are much more comfortable and very clean. Much easier to see with.</li>
    <li> I remember getting Lobob products years and years ago, and then all of a sudden, I just couldn&#x27;t find them anymore.  I&#x27;ve been wearing hard lenses for 30+ years.  My current set were getting oh-so-scratchy and in despiration I bought this stuff.  Even the enzymatic soaking stuff wasn&#x27;t doing a very good job.  This product really made a difference.  They don&#x27;t feel perfect, but certainly a whole lot better.</li>
    <li> Great product - cleans wonderfully and removes protien buildup.  Have used this for many years and it is still the best cleaner on the market.  Have tried many others but I always resort back to this one.</li>
    <li> After many many years with Bausch &amp; lomb&#x27;s sensitive gas perm cleaner it was discontinued.  This is a good substitute - not quite as thick but cleans protein deposits well.  It is now my cleaner of choice.  If you want clean gas perm contacts this is the way to go.  Bausch &amp; lomb told me to use the Boston Cleaners which I told them didn&#x27;t clean anything and were like water so I have found a new cleaner to replaced the good discontinued one and Bausch &amp; Lomb has lost my business.</li>
    <li> this is very superior to Boston cleaner. It is also  much better cost wise because you use less of it.</li>
    <li> Excellent solution for folks who are sensitive to preservatives. Lobob gas perm products are superior to all others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This cleaner is recommended by my eye doctor but isn&#x27;t available in very many stores.  Thanks Amazon for making it convenient and at a great price.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted....</li>
    <li> I have been wearing rigid gas Permeable lenses for many years now &amp; have been using Lobob Lens cleaning solutions for Quite sometime &amp; this product Lobob Optimum ESC is by far the best there is for cleaning my lenses &amp; keeping them clear &amp; feeling good all day..Great Stuff highly recommend it..Thank You</li>
    <li> Many years ago when I first started wear hard contact lenses Lobob was recommended.  Gas permeable became the standard and other cleaning products came on-line.  Finding this compatible product that cleans better is a great re-acquaintance.  Be aware that this product is alot more slippery than the other items I have used</li>
    <li> I tried this over the Boston Advanced cleaner. I wear RGP hard lenses. I think that both products work equally well. This product is a little cheaper than Boston, but not by much. I think the choice is a toss up. Go with which ever product you can find cheaper. There is no real difference in performance.</li>
    <li> Lobob Optimum Extra Strength Cleaner is the BEST product I have found for cleaning my gas-permeable contact lenses!  I have worn contacts for over 50 years, and frankly, I would not still be wearing them if I had not found Optimum ESC.  It cleans ALL of the \\&quot;foggy\\&quot; residue and does not damage the lens in anyway.  Hopefully, I will be using Optimum ESC for 50 more years!!!</li>
    <li> Best eye are product I have ever used. Has eliminated all of my contact lense cleaning problems</li>
    <li> Best available gas permeable cleaner........nothing else to say.</li>
    <li> Bought these for use with RGP lenses after reading some rave reviews online. Tried it for 2 months and eye irritation and dry eyes did not go away. This is not the end all for contacts users.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what i wanted &amp; needed.  Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Great buy!  Can&#x27;t find it locally except at eye dr.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this contact lens cleaner everywhere and usually I end up having to drive in to Sac. to my Orthokeratologist office to buy. If you wear hard gas permeable contact lenses you must try this. The build up of protein on your lenses disappear and they get CLEAN.</li>
    <li> Best cleaner I have found for hard (RGP) lenses, although that&#x27;s a low bar.  You also get a lot of it compared to other cleaners, so good value.</li>
    <li> After wearing contacts for 40 years, I finally found a cleaner which truly cleans. I was getting to the point that I could not wear the lens more that an hour with out having to clean them again with the former cleaner. Now 12 hours! Fantastic cleaning system.</li>
    <li> Fantastic stuff. I switched from the Boston set cleaning and conditioning solutions. Much better, and I expect the Lobob stuff will last a lot longer, too.</li>
    <li> have used this for years and only thing that gets rigid lens really grease free - make sure you rinse them thoroughly and you will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> I have been a devoted user of Lobob Optimum ESC (Extra Strength Cleaner) for 5 years. I wear gas perm bifocal contact lenses, am allergic to many preservatives, and suffer from dry eyes which makes the contacts develop a film by the end of the day.    There is absolutely no product that I have found that does as good a job cleaning my contacts. In fact, I actually STORE my contacts in the cleaning solution every night. The contacts are clean in the morning, stay clean longer, and I am not bothered by reactions to preservatives because this product is preservative free.    It is difficult to find where I live. The only store that carried it was Walgreens and now they have discontinued it. I ordered 4 bottles from Amazon and will continue to do so.    Try it!</li>
    <li> My favorite of the Lobob products for cleaning GP lenses.</li>
    <li> As one of only a few gas permeable wearers, I was quite happy when my eye doc recommended Lo Bob products. Nothing else on the market really does the trick for removing the protein build-up.</li>
    <li> Cleans significantly better than Bausch &amp; Lomb Boston Cleaner.  With Boston, lens got fuzzy after 8 hours.  Lobob Optimum does an exceptional job cleaning lens and they stay clean for the entire day.</li>
    <li> This stuff is cheap and effective but it is the same clear color and slightly thick viscosity as my rinsing solution! This morning I was in a rush and put a full lens-load into my eye and YOWIEEEEE!!! Took about half an hour for the redness to go away, so watch out!</li>
    <li> Removes makeup/protein where other products I&#x27;ve used wouldn&#x27;t including the weekly protein removal products.  Great product, so glad to have found it!</li>
    <li> My eye doctor gave me a sample of this a number of years ago, and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. It is hands-down the best RGP lens cleaner. I haven&#x27;t had to use a protein cleaner in years.</li>
    <li> Item was as expected!</li>
    <li> This is THE best cleaner for RGP lenses.  I have worn RGP for 20 years and have used all of the major brands.  Lobob is so good it will usually clean off the little black dot on the right lenses.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite cleaner, cleans well and does not sting the eyes. It isn&#x27;t always east to find in drugstores.</li>
    <li> It works. No problem.</li>
    <li> great solution, good price, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Life changing cleaner for hard and gas permeable contact lens wearers: I&#x27;ve worn contacts for 40 years and they started getting less and less comfortable. I attributed the comfort problems to degradation of my tears and was wearing my contacts less and less. With Lobob Optimum Extra Strength Cleaner my comfort has improved dramatically and the length of time that I can wear the contacts has increased. Moreover, I no longer need to use weekly enzymatic cleaner. Amazing product and all at a good price! I wish I had discovered this before. Spread the word about Lobob!</li>
    <li> Love this cleaner.  I normally use Clear Care for my gas permeable lens but sometimes find my lens aren&#x27;t as clear as I&#x27;d like when inserted them again.  Lobob&#x27;s Extra Strength Cleaner does the trick and has never failed me in getting my lens perfectly clean and clear and is always good for a quick fix when you contacts are just giving you a little bit of problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing hard contacts for years and this is by far the best cleaner I&#x27;ve used. Other cleaners still leave protein on my contact, but I haven&#x27;t had an issue since I started using optimum.</li>
    <li> Would recommend for gas permeable lens wearers.  It really cleans nicely and has no particulates in it that can cause irritation.  It is smooth and sterile.  Cleans extremely well.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Our eye Dr use to sell this in his office, but then he stopped.  So happy we found it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is the only product line that works for my RPG lenses.  I wish it was more readily available in the stores.</li>
    <li> Great for cleaning gas permeable lens. Better than baush and Lomb. Really cleans!!!</li>
    <li> A little hard to rinse off but small price to pay for clear vision.&lt;br /&gt;You can feel the clean after using this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried all of the brand name cleaners for my gas permeable contact lenses but find these do the best job of keeping them clean. With others I&#x27;ve used, after a while my lenses aren&#x27;t coming as clean, seem cloudy. With this cleaner I never have that problem.</li>
    <li> This product is great and it cleans my contact lense and I am able to see with out my glasses.</li>
    <li> This is the best lens cleaner!</li>
    <li> Exactly as promised, very good product!</li>
    <li> This product works like the old Bausch &amp; Lomb Cleaner used to.  Contacts are much more comfortable using this in combination with Optimum Storage Solution.  This is the only cleaner and storage solution I will buy from now on.</li>
    <li> This Lobob ESC cleaner works great.  I&#x27;ve used it for several years now on my rigid gas permeable lenses.  I use it 2x a week.  The other days I use Boston Advance cleaner.  It takes off other deposits that that the Boston cleaner doesn&#x27;t seem to work well on.  And it doesn&#x27;t cause any allergic reactions in my eyes.  Only gave it 4 stars since the seller sent me product that were out of the packaging.  Not sure why.  The ESC cleaners still had the safety seal on, so I&#x27;m using them anyway.</li>
    <li> I have a disease in my eyes that require special lens so my eyes do ot hurt and I can open then and use my eyes.  This is a gift to me for surviving cancer.  The lobob is used to clean the lens.  It is the only thing I can use and this was the only brand I can use.  I am so thankful that I was able to find it here.  It was a great purchase.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Recommended by contact specialist.</li>
    <li> Where has this stuff been my whole adult life??  If you wear gas permeable lenses, you are really missing out if you don&#x27;t use this.  I&#x27;ve always used Boton brand cleaner, but there is no comparison.  This cleaner gets rid of lens buildup almost with the first use.  It rinses clean, no eye irritation.  My lenses feel brand new!</li>
    <li> A product that&#x27;s actually as good as it claims. I&#x27;ve been wearing contact lenses for more than 40 years. I&#x27;ve tried all of the usual drug store cleaning and soaking solutions and none of them works like Lobob. So how come in forty years I&#x27;ve never heard of it before? Lobob, you need a new advertising agency. People need to learn about Lobob Optimum Strength Cleaner.</li>
    <li> The drug stores did not ofer this brand of contact lens cleaner, but the lens came with the recommendation to use this lens care product.  I was amazed at how much cleaner my lens were.  This is the product I will be using.</li>
    <li> I have always had trouble with protein deposits on my gas permeable lenses which could be almost impossible to remove.  After trying a trial size Lobob ESC I found that it works beautifully. It is the only thing I will use even though I have to order it online.</li>
    <li> My son has been wearing Dream Lens for a few years now and I used to use Boston one-step liquid enzymatic cleaner to clean them twice a month. For those who haven&#x27;t heard of Dream Lens they look like hard contact lens where you put into your eyes and sleep with them for 8 hrs or more to correct near-sightedness. Since my supply of Boston was getting low I checked the price on Amazon. Then I noticed this Lobob cleaner. I&#x27;m always a believer in customers&#x27; review. Because of the high rating of Lobob I decided to give it a try. After I used it for the very FIRST TIME my son told mom that he couldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; the lens in his eyes. He thought they have slipped away to the corner of his eye balls or somewhere. My wife checked and the lens were right there - front and center where they should be! My conclusion was that Lobob is simply magical in getting lens cleaned. Here is what I do (and I only have to do it once every 2 days or so): put one drop of Lobob in each of the lens, rub it a few times (it&#x27;s soapy and slimy but it can be washed off instantly), and I don&#x27;t even have to rub it for 30 sec as the instruction indicates, rinse them 2 times with the Walmart brand multi-purpose solution and store them in the same MP solution. I clean them in the morning when I take them off from my son, soak them in MP solution for the rest of the day till he wears them again before bed time. I&#x27;m truly impressed by Lobob and has the same question like other reviewers commented: how come I have never heard of this product and how come they&#x27;re not widely available in every retail store? Lobob&#x27;s marketing department still has a lot of catching up to do. Meanwhile, Boston, you got a problem &#x27;cos I&#x27;m switching to Lobob from now on. The 2 oz bottle is actually quite a big one, considering that I only use 2 drops at a time. So it is good for a long time.</li>
    <li> Best cleaner for gas perm contacts. So clean feeling and they wear so much more comfortable</li>
    <li> Not much to say, really.  My wife has sensitive eyes among other eye issues.  She has tries so many different brands.  This is the best brand/product so far.  Less irritation ans best over all results.</li>
    <li> great price for a great product.....recommended by a tech at a leading eye center!</li>
    <li> This product is really great to clean hard contact glasses, it really make my contact glasses clean and shine, hardly recommender if you live in a humidity weather.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing hard contacts for 18 years, this is the best solution when used with distiller water!!!! Prior to finding Optimum Extra Strength cleaning solution, Boston products were the only option I was given. I&#x27;m happy to locate this product on Amazon!</li>
    <li> As a gas permeable/hard contact lens wearer for almost 40 years, this is by far and unequivocally THE BEST cleaner EVER.  I&#x27;ve used other manufacturer&#x27;s bottled cleaner liquids AND protein removers and THIS PRODUCT IS THE BEST. The fluid is clear and feels slippery while use with the contact and CLEANS (unlike others, which are milky white and dubious cleaning performance leaving smeared residue).  I have no intent to buy any other gas permeable cleaning product now that I found this!  Bottle is 2-3x the product volume of competitors and overall is a GREAT value for the price - aside from its impeccable cleaning ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a keeper.  Why is it not readily found in retail stores - it would put competitors out of business!</li>
    <li> Been wearing hard lenses for 42 years, a friend told me about Lobo about 10 years ago. It is the only thing that can get the oils off of my contacts. I don&#x27;t have to use anything else. At night I store my lenses in water, been doing it for years. I also do not use wetting solution.  I have spent a lot of money on Boston products over the years and can say it is over priced JUNK. I have never had an eye problem ever. Having stigmatism is a pain for getting a good contact fit, but why make it more of a pain by purchasing over price junk from the Boston company. you won&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding this product in the stores, and it is the only one that works for my G.P contacts...Having it available at a good price and shipped directly to the home is so convenient .  Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> Not as good as Miraflow but with that product no longer available this is the next best.  I combine with Boston&#x27;s Simplus and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the best lens cleaner I&#x27;ve found for gas permeable lenses. Since I started using it two years ago, my lenses are squeaky clean and don&#x27;t fog.  The one thing you have to be careful about though, is rinsing the lens thoroughly before putting it in your eye because this cleaner will sting, At least it does in my eyes. Other than that, it&#x27;s a life-saver. GREAT PRODUCT. I won&#x27;t use anything else now, as my vision is SO MUCH BETTER with lenses that don&#x27;t have a protein build up.</li>
    <li> There are not many options when buying products for hard contact lenses.  This one works well enough, but comes out a bit fast so you get much more than you need from one squirt.</li>
    <li> My problem was protein deposits that wouldn&#x27;t clean off my Rigid Gas Permeable Lenses, making it virtually impossible to see clearly after as few as 3 months. This solution (unlike Boston products) actually works! I can see again! When I first received it, I cleaned my lenses 3-4 times per day for a couple of days to remove the existing (heavy) protein deposits. Now I just use it 1-2 times per week to keep them clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so grateful for an excellent &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34; to my problem!</li>
    <li> I purchased this cleaner for my contacts.  I still use gas perm lens and it is the best product on the market.</li>
    <li> Optimum ESC  Cleans well, but very slippery so more likely to drop a contact lens than if used Miraflow .</li>
    <li> I have used Lobob cleaner for decades at the recommendation of my original opthamalogist.  I find it&#x27;s quality has been consistent even though local supply has not. I was pleased to find it available online.</li>
    <li> Good product for a good price</li>
    <li> I used to buy this at the drug store and then couldn&#x27;t find it.  This is the best contact lens cleaner, hands down.  It removes the oils and gunk from lenses and makes them feel so much better.</li>
    <li> Cleans much better than the all in one solutions. I use it once or twice a week to clean my gas permeable contacts.</li>
    <li> You should ask my doctor whether the product is good. It seems to work fine! There&#x27;s nothing more to say!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It cleans better than any other permeable contact lens cleaner I&#x27;ve used thus far...I will continue to buy it and use it as it works wonderfully...</li>
    <li> Great cleaner for gas permeable lenses</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Boston cleaner for decades and recently found out about this product. I tried it and found it to be a bit better than the more expensive Boston version. Not &#x27;head and shoulders&#x27; above the Boston, but still noticeably better. And considering that is is a few dollars cheaper for a 2oz. bottle versus a 1oz. of the Boston, it&#x27;s a no-brainer to continue to use the Lobob ESC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Of course, if I&#x27;m in an emergency and can&#x27;t order this stuff quickly enough (and I&#x27;m in serious need), I&#x27;ll suck it up and pay (or overpay) for the Boston until I can get this product back in my house.</li>
    <li> I use this product to clean my gas permeable hard contact lenses.  A good cleaner for this type of contact is almost impossible to find anymore and my doctor recommended this one.  Said it was the best on the market today so I was quite thrilled when I found it on Amazon.  It works very, very well and I am yes I am pleased.  I love my contacts and thought at my age I was going to have to give them up, but keeping them clean with this cleaner has made all the difference in the world.</li>
    <li> I just discovered Lobob recommended by my ophthalmologist after years using another popular brand for gas perm lens. There is no comparison!! This is awesome. So happy I found it.</li>
    <li> my husband says lobob optimum works great for gas permeable lenses.  He loves it. He&#x27;s used it in the past.</li>
    <li> This is the brand that my ophthalmologist recommended as being the least scratchy to my lenses.  I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years on my GP lenses.  It seriously removes all the gunk that accumulates during the day.</li>
    <li> Works especially well for hard to clean deposits on contact lenses. I would recommend this to anyone who has problems with difficult deposits on their lenses.</li>
