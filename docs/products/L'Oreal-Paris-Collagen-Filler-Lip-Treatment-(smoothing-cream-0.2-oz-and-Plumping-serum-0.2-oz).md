      <li>L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Filler Lip Treatment works better than chapstick or any lip balms I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>It does seem to make it plump up and look better.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>more wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
      <li>I re-ordered it as I do like it but don&#x27;t expect magic.</li>
      <li>I bought many from Amazon</li>
      <li>And for my lips more and more, I am fifty</li>
      <li>OK I DONT FEEL THE TINGLY BURNING FELLING</li>
      <li>best ever for tiny wrinkles around the lips</li>
      <li>I love using them every day.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>FOR NOW THIS PRODUCT IS OK.</li>
      <li>I had always had very full lips, but found that they had shrunk with age.</li>
      <li>Most are no longer available in stores.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Amazon has the Best Price - Hands down -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m already worried that soon it won&#x27;t be available online.</li>
      <li>&quot; feeling is what creates the lip inflation to be such sexy pucker Lips !!</li>
      <li>Granted I only use the plumping side but it is by far the best I have found.</li>
      <li>Good stuff ,and on me its the only one that did plump my lips,</li>
      <li>Just as good as the regular Collagen filler, but targets the lip area.  </li>
      <li>Great lip liner that hides lines for a few hours.</li>
      <li>Okay product, moisturizes around the mouth, but I noticed that the lines around my lips seemed a little more pronounced after using it.</li>
      <li>Thought it sounded too good to be true, it was a waste!</li>
      <li>I like this product very much for plumping and filling lips.</li>
      <li>I love the feel of this lip treatment and it truly softens lines around the lips and smooths the actual lips.  </li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
      <li>This product really works!</li>
      <li>It also needs to be re-applied after eating, same as most lipsticks.</li>
      <li>she is always pleased with this order, especially since she cannot find it in a store.</li>
      <li>Love this product and use it daily</li>
      <li>This product really helps with the tiny lines around my lips, and just makes my lips feel better.  </li>
      <li>As I am getting older, I realize I need a little help, so when I find a really good product, I try to stick with it.  </li>
      <li>It is a good product but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>Purchasing this product on Amazon has saved me a lot of money compared to its cost even when you can locate it in a large discount store.</li>
      <li>If used properly, it will help disguise fine lines around the mouth.</li>
      <li>I was really hoping for even a minuet change.</li>
      <li>The packaging is a bit awkward--two separate tubes that fit into an central cap.</li>
      <li>It does absolutely nothing for my lips.</li>
      <li>It works very well</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>and I really need them all my life....</li>
      <li>Really works.</li>
      <li>in case you don&#x27;t know, there&#x27;s an end that is supposed to define the line on your lips and an end that is supposed to (once you&#x27;ve used the whole bottle) make your lips fuller.</li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>but then I put it on my lips----worked very well.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this, but after putting it on, and following the instructions, Nothing.</li>
      <li>Love them and the price was just right for my small wallet.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the fast</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s at most a very temporary fix to covering the lines above the lips, to disappear within a very short time.  </li>
      <li>My lips still looks Old!!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s dead body a rim job than spend more money on this product.</li>
      <li>I have always been very self cautious about my lips, and this stuff really helps give me some extra volume.</li>
      <li>very old, it was made in August 2009, how can it help?</li>
      <li>and it will dry clear with full lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I usually had to find it on sale or discounted and still paid more.  </li>
      <li>I first bought this at my local CVS, and found after a week or so of conscientious use that my lips were regaining fullness.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in my lips and would have expected more product for the price even though it gives you the ounces I would&#x27;ve expected</li>
      <li>so naturally they quit making it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this was stolen merchandise, old stock, rejected stock, or what.</li>
      <li>I was buying this in the stores for $17 dollars and was surprised to find it on \\&quot;amazon\\&quot; for $5 dollars.</li>
      <li>Does not work, do not waste your money</li>
      <li>glad I only wasted $11.00.</li>
      <li>As good as the expensive ones.</li>
      <li>BUT I MEAN ITS OK PROBABLY WONT BUY IT AGAIN</li>
      <li>fine, but a bit small for the price</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
      <li>This product works for fine lines but is not effective for deep wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t due much for plumping of the lips - just softening.</li>
      <li>i mean, for such a huge cosmetics company, you&#x27;d think that they&#x27;d hire people who could actually create a product that works.</li>

    <li> Okay product, moisturizes around the mouth, but I noticed that the lines around my lips seemed a little more pronounced after using it.</li>
    <li> Not impressed would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Item was as described.</li>
    <li> Hello, my name is Yoko and I am a Makeup Artist. One day while I was on set one of my models had amazing LIPS. She ran to her bag and grabbed the Loreal Lip Collagene!! I ordered mine the same evening and this is my 2nd re-order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Recommend Using this Product Before Wearing your Favorite Lipstick. Needs about 15 min and it will dry clear with full lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember Ladies the collagene lip products will always give a \\&quot;tangy\\&quot; feel! Believe it or not the \\&quot;tangy\\&quot; feeling is what creates the lip inflation to be such sexy pucker Lips !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has the Best Price - Hands down -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Loreal &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> This product is no better than a creme that you can get for a few dollars. I have used this for two weeks now, sometimes applying it twice, as is suggested in the instructions. It&#x27;s at most a very temporary fix to covering the lines above the lips, to disappear within a very short time.  The so-called \\&quot;plumping\\&quot; of the lips does no plumping.</li>
    <li> I started using this product a few years ago and now feel I should stick with it.  I&#x27;m not sure I see much of difference.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work at all!!!! I&#x27;ve used $1.00 lip gloss that \\&quot;plumped\\&quot; better!! Total crap! Save your money! Thought it sounded too good to be true, it was a waste! Didn;t work at all!!</li>
    <li> I was buying this in the stores for $17 dollars and was surprised to find it on \\&quot;amazon\\&quot; for $5 dollars. The very same thing...I think the lip liner filler works great, I don&#x27;t think the lip plumper works at all though.</li>
    <li> Wife ordered three of these.The three came in two different packages, all had worn and rounded corners, one had a drug store security sticker on it from a national chain. Another had a glue spot from a removed sticker. I don&#x27;t know if this was stolen merchandise, old stock, rejected stock, or what.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 6 months and have noticed a gradual improvement in the lines around my mounth and the volume of my lips. This is the best price I have found, too.  I usually had to find it on sale or discounted and still paid more.  This isn&#x27;t a once use and done; it has to be used religiously.</li>
    <li> Love them and the price was just right for my small wallet.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I use them whenever needed, several times a day.</li>
    <li> The lip plumper lotion did nothing or very little for my lips. However, the collagen lotion side did wonders for my lips.  You are instructed to put around the lips, which I did but then I put it on my lips----worked very well.  Reduced those lines in my lips!  I wish I could buy just that lotion, but I like it enough to buy the set again.</li>
    <li> this product just doesn&#x27;t work. i used it dry and all it did for me was moisturize my lips very slightly. the seller was fine and got it here one time and undamaged but the product itself is as effective as putting a paper bag on my head and expecting plump lips. i mean, for such a huge cosmetics company, you&#x27;d think that they&#x27;d hire people who could actually create a product that works. in case you don&#x27;t know, there&#x27;s an end that is supposed to define the line on your lips and an end that is supposed to (once you&#x27;ve used the whole bottle) make your lips fuller. i put the sad excuse for caulk on my lips exactly how the (terrible and not very helpful) directions said, and what ensued was not even close to expectation. the product was not absorbed by my lips at all, and proceeded to dry and flake off. the taste was also similar to poop-encased silly putty. i wouldn&#x27;t wish this product on my worst enemy. basically, i would rather drain a unicorn of all of it&#x27;s glistening magical blood and then give it&#x27;s dead body a rim job than spend more money on this product.</li>
    <li> The plumper works wonders (it&#x27;s the only lip plumper I have used that has worked for me) but the filler does nothing for me.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and absolutely love it. It fills in my lines and keeps my lipstick from bleeding</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Filler Lip Treatment works better than chapstick or any lip balms I&#x27;ve tried.  Use morning and before bed.</li>
    <li> This product works for fine lines but is not effective for deep wrinkles. It also needs to be re-applied after eating, same as most lipsticks. If used properly, it will help disguise fine lines around the mouth. I re-ordered it as I do like it but don&#x27;t expect magic.</li>
    <li> Broke me out all around my mouth. WILL NOT be repurchasing. Couldn&#x27;t use long enough to see if it did what it claims to do</li>
    <li> Great lip liner that hides lines for a few hours.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS OK I DONT FEEL THE TINGLY BURNING FELLING LIKE I THINK BUT I MEAN ITS OK PROBABLY WONT BUY IT AGAIN</li>
    <li> I love using them every day. I can not leave without them. My skin is sensitive and delicate, these favors me. And for my lips more and more, I am fifty and I really need them all my life....</li>
    <li> As good as the expensive ones.</li>
    <li> Works wonders. I have re purchased this product muliple times. Granted I only use the plumping side but it is by far the best I have found.</li>
    <li> Seems to work. I use it under my makeup especially the around the lip one.  It does seem to make it plump up and look better.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have always been very self cautious about my lips, and this stuff really helps give me some extra volume. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Pleased with this item.  Will order again when required.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product works like it says but I feel like it works lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has a great price (It&#x27;s $19.99 in stores!) and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product has not done a lot for me but I am trying to give it the benefit of the doubt and see if it makes a different if I finish it out and see what happens</li>
    <li> Product works well. Even though you use it sparingly, I would like to have larger amounts for the price.</li>
    <li> great products used alone or together.  Now, hard to find.</li>
    <li> Nicely fills in those feathery lines around the mouth.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have used it for years. It does exactly what it says it does. I use it for help with wrinkles around the lip line. It works very well. I buy three at a time as some times its not available.</li>
    <li> very old, it was made in August 2009, how can it help? Code FF223V, you can check here http://www.checkfresh.com/</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Really works.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this lip treatment and it truly softens lines around the lips and smooths the actual lips.  Purchasing this product on Amazon has saved me a lot of money compared to its cost even when you can locate it in a large discount store.</li>
    <li> best ever for tiny wrinkles around the lips</li>
    <li> fine, but a bit small for the price</li>
    <li> This is the best lip treatment I have found!  I had purchased at a drugstore years ago, and had been unable to find it again.  My skin is dry, and my lips always feel dry.  As I am getting older, I realize I need a little help, so when I find a really good product, I try to stick with it.  This product really helps with the tiny lines around my lips, and just makes my lips feel better.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> loreal paris collagen filler is  treat my too dry and lined lips really filled with collagen  with good price from amazon( Web&#x27;s best deals ).</li>
    <li> Good product.  All of the L&#x27;oreal collagen fillers work for me.  Most are no longer available in stores.  I&#x27;m already worried that soon it won&#x27;t be available online.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. I was so excited to try this, but after putting it on, and following the instructions, Nothing. Nothing.. and more nothing. No tingle, no plumping, no Hydration NOTHING. Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love how this has two sides...one for the outer rim of your lips to moisturizer and prevent lipstick fading, but also a part to put on your lips themselves that is a great base for your lipstick or gloss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE USED THIS PRODUCT BEFORE, BUT COULD FIND IT AGAIN IN STORE.  THIS THE REASON I GOT IT ON THE INTERNET.&lt;br /&gt;I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT LETS ME GET MY LIPSTICK ON SMOOTHER, BUT IT DOES NOT DO ALL THAT IT SAYS IT DOES. FOR NOW THIS PRODUCT IS OK.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product at a very cheap but it is a robbery, they sent me a damaged product, up, smells bad, rancid oil, fraganci zero, I have to throw. is a deception theft, damage can not sell something like this to good but cheap.</li>
    <li> Does not work, do not waste your money</li>
    <li> Okay.  I&#x27;m over that hill, and I have wrinkles. I have used various products.  I have a prescription for keeping my layers changing over because of rosacea issues.  But, for deep wrinkles and crows feet, I find the Loreal Collagen fillers are my favorites. The reason is, even without makeup, when photographed or in home videos, my skin looks amazing. :-)</li>
    <li> On time and loving it Thankyou:)</li>
    <li> Based on reviews, seems your going to love it or hate it. I love it. I had always had very full lips, but found that they had shrunk with age. I first bought this at my local CVS, and found after a week or so of conscientious use that my lips were regaining fullness. Now, I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. Of course, I found it hard to find locally ever since. Glad to see it&#x27;s so readily available on Amazon... and at an excellent price. Use morning and evening. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. The packaging is a bit awkward--two separate tubes that fit into an central cap. And they never run out at the same time, but you can supplement with the L&#x27;Oreal Collagen Filler, which comes in a 1oz tube.[[ASIN:B001TTKXR6 L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Filler Lip Treatment, 0.4-Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> it was suposed to plump lips and fill lines, but it didnt do any thing more than an expensive messy chapstick.</li>
    <li> I keep buying this.incredible product</li>
    <li> Good stuff ,and on me its the only one that did plump my lips, so naturally they quit making it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in my lips and would have expected more product for the price even though it gives you the ounces I would&#x27;ve expected more wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
    <li> This gives your lips a smoother and slightly plumper look.  Dont&#x27; expect the &#x27;angelina joli look&#x27; with this product, but expect a  nice base coat for lip color.</li>
    <li> I guess I was expecting to do more for me- glad I only wasted $11.00. would not recommend this product</li>
    <li> I like this product very much for plumping and filling lips.Have used it for a number of years and it&#x27;s especially good when wearing a darker shade of lipstick.</li>
    <li> This product really works! Plumps lips as well as prevents feathering around the lips. Don&#x27;t be fooled by cheaper price!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recall purchasing this product but if I did, it wasn&#x27;t for myself.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now and my lipstick still bleeds into the creases around my lips.</li>
    <li> no problem withy the shipment etc however i did not see any results. may be good just to moustirize your lips, that&#x60;s all...</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, it did nothing for my lips. I was really hoping for even a minuet change. Something! Anything! Oh, there was something! A little tingling feeling aound the lips, but no change in appearance! Nope! Nada! Nah! Nelsch! Nothing!!! My lips still looks Old!!</li>
    <li> Just as good as the regular Collagen filler, but targets the lip area.  Love this product and use it daily</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t due much for plumping of the lips - just softening.</li>
    <li> What this product does is something I can&#x27;t figure out. It does absolutely nothing for my lips. 2 stars for the slight moisturisation I got out of it. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> This was for my ex gierlfriend. she is always pleased with this order, especially since she cannot find it in a store.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Sorry that Loreal seems to have discontinued it.  I bought many from Amazon so i,would not run out for a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the lip treatment.  It works very well, I use night and day!!! Will keep purchasing this and Amazon has the best prices!</li>
    <li> It is a good product but it doesn&#x27;t last long. Maybe I need to use it more to see good results.</li>
