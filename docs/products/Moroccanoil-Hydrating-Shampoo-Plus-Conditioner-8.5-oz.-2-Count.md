<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love love love this!! It makes my hair smell soo good. I wash my hair twice a wek and it smells like I wash it everyday. And made my hair soft. Love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> After years of coloring and exposing my hair to high-heat procedures (blow drying and flat ironing), my hair had gotten dry and brittle. After my hair stylist recommended I try Moroccanoil and reading rave reviews about it, I decided to spend the extra money instead of buying standard shampoos and conditioners available at CVS, Walgreens, grocery stores, Target, Costco, etc. After a couple days, I noticed that my hair was softer, silkier and less dry. I continued to use the Moroccanoil shampoo and conditioner for over a year and was very happy with the way my hair felt and looked. (Even my husband noticed the difference!) Starting to wonder if the Moroccanoil really made a difference and if the extra cost was worth it, I switched back to my old standard shampoo &amp; conditioner. After one month, I noticed my hair was getting dryer and more brittle again. I immediately switched back to Moroccanoil and noticed an improvement within days. I am convinced now and will stick with Moroccanoil. It is definitely worth the extra cost to have my hair feeling so silky and soft.</li>
    <li> Just received my shampoo package and it had leaked in the box , this was a Christmas gift so very disapointed</li>
    <li> I love this product, but although it was bagged for shipment, all four of the bottles I ordered exploded and were a complete mess.  This isn&#x27;t the cheapest brand in the world, so any loss of product is a complete tragedy.</li>
    <li> It is very thick so you only need a small amount.  I ordered this because my hair dresser recommended it for my fly away hair.  It does not do what I wanted.  My hair is still fly away, but it is not dry. Go figure.  I will not waste my money again. Store brands work just as well.</li>
    <li> Makes curly gray hair soft and manageable, just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Nice smell!</li>
    <li> The only good thing I can say is the conditioner smells so good, besides that I found the product very disappointing.  Not at all what I expected. The shampoo leaves your hair feeling like straw and just so...ugh.  The conditioner felt a little better , and like I said smelled great, but again didn&#x27;t give the results I was led to expect. Overall I think this was a waste of money and definitely will not be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Works great on my hair as well as my human hair extensions. I use the whole product line and have grown really fond of it.</li>
    <li> The product from this seller was not the original formula, the conditioner has a pinkish hue normally but this is white like elmers glue and both bottles smell way too strong like perfume. Not what you find from a beauty supply store. Plus the shampoo gave me flakes.</li>
    <li> Competive pricing.  Quick delivery.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love the conditioner, however the shampoo isn&#x27;t the best.  It feels like it&#x27;s drying my hair out during use. It doesn&#x27;t disperse smoothly like the conditioner.  My next purchase will be through my local salon so I can see if the quality is the same.  Smells awesome though!</li>
    <li> It is worth the price. Shampoo clarifies the conditioner detangles and enhance curl. The smell is great and leave hair moisturized</li>
    <li> This is not authentic MorocannOil product. I have been using the products for years. literally did my first shampooing w/ my current bottle of shampoo, then my next w/ this new bottle. The color was different, as was the consistency and the smell. The same w/ the conditioner. In fact the shampoo even lathered up much more than original product, I had just used. Moroccanoiloil products are thicker, and have a unique scent. I was very disappointed that I couldn&#x27;t count on Amazon to make sure their vendors only supplied original product.</li>
    <li> Works great, smells great-&lt;br /&gt;A bit pricey</li>
    <li> I LOVE the conditioner, but the shampoo is horrible... my hair feels like dry, tangled straw after I use the shampoo (but it DOES smell wonderful!!).  Also, the shampoo had opened slightly and leaked in the packaging.  Not a lot, just enough to make a mess.  I would definitely buy the conditioner again, but NOT the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Have used this duo before. Very nice smell and leaves my hair well washed and conditioned.</li>
    <li> awesome for your hair.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricy!</li>
    <li> I love Moroccan Oil products but this is not the real thing. I tried to use it thinking maybe it was just a different batch then the last one that I bought from the salon.  However after using it a few times my hair looks and feels like straw!!!!  Very unhappy with this purchase!!!!</li>
    <li> We love this shampoo and conditioner. My hair is so soft when I use them and it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I love how it gives volume to my hair. Smells the best.</li>
    <li> helpful shampoo&amp;conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Thanks :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the products for years.  It is great for my thick hair.  Moroccanoil products are difficult to find where I live so ordering through Amazon is very convenient!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African American female and my ends tend to become dry.  I used the shampoo and conditioner along with the treatment and could feel and see the difference in my hair after the first use. My hair is much softer and easier to manage when wet.</li>
    <li> I love the product, however mine arrived with the bottles wrapped together and damaged so I definitely didn&#x27;t get my money&#x27;s worth out of this one at all. The shampoo makes my hair feel amazing and removes the stiffness of having it highlighted. I just wish I had gotten all of the shampoo here instead of on the inside of the shipping envelope.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the conditioner makes my hair super soft.</li>
    <li> very very strong fragrance. Good shampoo but the fragrance was so strong it make me sick.  could not use it.</li>
    <li> Game changer right here! AMAZING, most amazing shampoo/conditioner I have ever used...and I have tried nearly every product on the shelf. Worth every single penny!!!</li>
    <li> One of the reason I love Moroccanoil products is because of their smell!  I think it is absolutely amazing, and it definitely leaves your hair smelling great!  I&#x27;m not sure if it is purely because it is Sulfate-Free or what, but the shampoo can sometimes leave a little bit of a greasy residue on the bottom of my scalp.  The conditioner is great though and makes my hair feel conditioned and healthy.</li>
    <li> Both the shampoo and conditioner are very creamy and hydrating.  I love both of these products.  I have long thick hair and I live in the desert and these products help keep my hair moisturized, silky, and shiny.</li>
    <li> It nourishes my scalp so well that my thoughts become uncloudy. I had no idea I was fluent in so many languages before Moroccanoil changed my life for the better.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever tried.  It makes your hair feel so healthy, and soft, by the time you are done using the product you have no split ends, no frizz....I would highly recommend this product if you want great looking hair........Bernadette</li>
    <li> This product is great for color treated/dry hair. It was recommended to me by a hairdresser. Only a small amount is used for each washing so it lasts a long time. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My 2nd order, this is great for my hair ! Soft and silky.</li>
    <li> My products arrived as promised! After receiving a Keratin treatment, the Moroccan Shampoo and conditioner, along with the Moroccan Oil keeps my once-upon-a-time damaged hair healthier and alive again!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great, hydrates your hair and rinses out without leaving weight. Love it! Buy some! Haven&#x27;t seen it in stores.</li>
    <li> This product is not like the newer ones. I believe it is an old product this company is just trying to get rid of for the same price as the newer ones.</li>
    <li> I have wavy, course, color treated hair..this product helps with all three issues, I tried many other shampoo&#x27;s but this seems to be&lt;br /&gt;the best product for me and my challenging hair !</li>
    <li> Moroccanoil is such a great product. I have been using it for about 1 year and my hair loves it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo and conditioner before this definitely seems like a fake.  It gave me a rash all over my face and has a terrible smell. 40$ wasted. Do not buy this by your shampoos from a salon.  I learned my lesson this is terrible.</li>
    <li> VERY HAPPY WITH PURCHASE AND DELIVERY</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. It makes my hair silky. This is also great for winter. Keeps your hair from drying out and being frizzy.</li>
    <li> The bottles were spilled in the box. I just won&#x27;t buy this shampoo again I like the oil and that&#x27;s it</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. Smells AMAZING. My hair is shiny and soft after one use. My hair still smelled good after not washing it for 2 days and going into a pool, that never happens. I highly recommend this product. The only reason it&#x27;s not getting 5 stars is because it said it was Amazon prime shipping but it took over a week for delivery.</li>
    <li> I use this once a week, and it&#x27;s fantastic for hydrating my hair! Especially since I straighten my hair sometimes. You can&#x27;t use it everyday, but once or twice a week this is a great shampoo. It makes my hair very shiny.</li>
    <li> I received this product with saran wrap around the top which I assume was to prevent spillage.  Upon opening I am just not sure the product is the same as previous purchase from a different distributor.  I don&#x27;t think I will be buying from this site again!</li>
    <li> Love the product leaves ur hair with shine n softness. I recommend the product my hairstyles uses the product on my hair n that&#x27;s how I was introduce to moroccanoil shampoo n conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. It makes my hair so soft. The only downside was that when I received my package, some of the product leaked out and caused a bit of a mess. Other than that, I love this stuff</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product at a hair salon.  I loved it and have used it ever since.  My hair is fine, color treated and somewhat dry.  This product, combined with other Moroccanoil products, has made a big difference in the quality of my hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Really did love this product on my curly hair but they are NOT GLUTEN FREE!! After 3 uses I became very ill and realized it was the product. The company itself confirmed that their products are not gluten free</li>
    <li> Not pleased with the shampoo.  It says &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; it really dries my hair out.  Will not purchase again.  The conditioner is fine</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> The shampoo leaves my hair feeling &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;.  The conditioner rocks.  I use this with the Oil &amp; the curl cream &amp; love, love, love my hair, but I think I&#x27;ll skip this shampoo &amp; conditioner next time.  I&#x27;ll just use Suave Moroccan Oil, makes my hair feel softer - and stick with the other products from this line.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and highly recommend it to anyone that wants to pamper their hair.  It is very gentle on the hair and smells great.  The seller sent the product asap and i couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is another shampoo and rinse I never used till I found it on amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;I really like makes my hair silky and shinny.</li>
    <li> shampoo is a little hard on my hair. conditioner is awesome. Smells good too!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this shampoo &amp; conditioner. I have fine hair and this shampoo not only cleans well but also gives my hair more tickness &amp; makes it look fuller. The conditioner is great too. Some coditioners make my hair so soft that it won&#x27;t hold a style. This one  conditions well &amp; makes my hair look so healthy and shiny. Styling is great with this conditioner. I used to buy this at the salon but save about $14 purchasing it on Amazon. Great buy &amp; a Great product!</li>
    <li> My order arrived quickly and I really love the products!</li>
    <li> Will not use anything else on my hair.  My hair was dry and  needed some TLC.  This was just the product I needed.  And it smells so good and fresh that my teen daughter has been using it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the changes this shampoo/conditioner has made in the texture of my chemically treated, sun damaged hair.  I also use the serum.  My hair is noticeably healthier.</li>
    <li> The shampoo lathers nicely but leaves my hair feeling like straw.  Love the conditioner.  Will not consider shampoo for future purchases but will continue with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for a daughter. She is very pleased with it. I will keep it in mind for future gift giving.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, but buyers take note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) You aren&#x27;t supposed to shampoo your hair every day. Your hair has natural oils that keep it from getting dry, and REAL (non-synthetic) shampoos like this one can leave your hair feeling dry if you overuse them. Their Moroccan Oil helps, but it&#x27;s still no substitute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) You&#x27;re not supposed to use the same shampoo and conditioner every time. Just like P90x uses &amp;#34;muscle confusion&amp;#34; to get your body to peak physical fitness (not that I would know...), your hair needs a mixup as well. Don&#x27;t just spend the extra money on this shampoo and conditioner, buy another brand or two as well and alternate between them every few days. It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re gonna go bad...</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  It smells amazing and it works really well on my hair since I have thick, coarse hair.</li>
    <li> Love these products!  My hair is so soft.  They came well within the arrival time and also did not leak!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> The product is great no matter where you get it. This shipper did not package the liquid correctly, and both the conditioner and the shampoo had leaked out. Not fun.</li>
    <li> Usually a great product....but watered down this time...definitely different</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a number of years and really enjoy the smell and the way it makes my hair feel. This is the first time getting it from Amazon and not a Salon. I don&#x27;t have any old bottles to compare it to, as I am stationed out of the US at the moment but I can honestly say...to me, It&#x27;s not the same and In my opinion, my hair is left dryer and the smell is a bit different. Although it&#x27;s still better than most shampoos, I&#x27;m just not 100% sold on the authenticity and quality of this product compared to the one I get at the Salons.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  Smells so good!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, the smell is incredible and the conditioner makes your hair feel  soft and it helps calm frizzyness. But this stuff is rather expensive and every time i come back to buy it the price has raised so i use it sparingly.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly, containers in great shape.  Love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> Actually made my hair even drier, very brittle and it started falling out!!</li>
    <li> I received 2 bottles of unite 7 seconds condition, instead. this is a scam happening</li>
    <li> My hair was to dry using this product is amazing my hair now is soft and silky i love it 😊😃⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</li>
    <li> The hydrating shampoo is pure luxury. Both are thick and creamy. Results are outstanding</li>
    <li> the shampoo is okay but the conditioner is horrible. It got hair loss when using the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love these products ... I&#x27;ve been using them for only about two months now, two times a week. I am in my mid 60&#x27;s and my hair is long and seems much dryer as I age. I&#x27;ve been using the Moroccanoil for over a year as my hair is pretty dry from midway down and especially the ends. The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair soft and managable and I really like the fragrance it provides.... it&#x27;s even got my wife using it on occasion. I gave it 4 stars because the jury is still out in my mind regarding how well it will hydrate my dry conditon. I am thinking I need to give it some more time. I&#x27;d recommend this product to everyone as long as they are not fragrance concious.</li>
    <li> The best! I hAve been having trouble with my hair since a surgery. It was dry and thin. I had tried everything that everyone else recommended without any improvement. This product revived my hair from the first use, both hydrating and volumnizing. Kind of a miracle for me!</li>
    <li> I preferred if the products were on original box.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It literally is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel and smell.</li>
    <li> I love these products, they keep your hair very smooth but it still manages to hold the curl. Smells amazing, and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance of this shampoo, and how soft it makes my hair feel. Love the oil for extra shine.</li>
    <li> This is the most hydrating shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, plus the conditioner does not make hair flat.  Love this products and highly recommend.  They smell good too!</li>
    <li> Smells great shampoo leaves my hair very dry but conditioner is very good</li>
    <li> Significantly helped my dry hair</li>
    <li> Really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;Max123</li>
    <li> i expected for these to be bigger since they were kinda pricey and I was pretty upset when I got them and realized how small they were. If you bought 2 sets of these, the price would be equivelant to the 33oz bottles which are the big ones so this is a rip off!</li>
    <li> love it :) smells great!!!</li>
    <li> The Cadillac of shampoo. Smells amazing, makes my hair so soft and silky. Feels like I have no heat and stylist damage after every use!</li>
    <li> My hair has never been softer!! Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I love these products, it made my hair smooth and shiny! I truly recommend.</li>
    <li> i just love it!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is so shiny and it looks amazing!!! :D i used to have dry hair and i was always looking for new products until my sister recomended me this shampoo and conditioner. You better try them ;D</li>
    <li> This shampoo/conditioner are kind of expensive but it is more than worth it. Its smell so nice and leave my hair so soft an shinny. I died my hair and its kind of dry around 20 days after coloring and this shampoo do its jobs. I also use the mask.</li>
    <li> excellent product and sender.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the shampoo and the products arrived in a timely manner, however the bottles were packaged in a thin envelope with very little protective sealing and they arrived with half of the product spilled out. My lovely local post office stuck the shampoo and conditioner soaked envelope in a plastic bag and threw it in my mailbox. I contacted sender with photos and got new ones sent. Other than that love the shampoo and conditioner. They smell amazing, hydrate wiothout weighjing hair down, and the price is great.</li>
    <li> I would not think of using a different product. I love how it helps my hair in it&#x27;s healing process. I love that it is available on line as it is difficult to obtain in salons.</li>
    <li> works well! I fried my hair and it is helping to repair the damage.</li>
    <li> Love this brand! Came very quickly after purchasing. The morrocan oil is a necessity too, overall great line. Perfect for my curly hair that always benefits from hydrating products.</li>
    <li> I have been searching a long time for a shampoo and conditioner to help my hair feel soft again.  Having three children left my hair brittle and dry looking (and feeling).  I found this online and decided to give it a try.  As I was using the shampoo in the shower, I was let down immediately because it made my hair feel even MORE dry and tangled.  Then, I crack open the conditioner and get using that.  And... wow... AMAZING!!  It rinsed clean and made my hair super smooth in the shower.  When I got out, it brushed out very easily (before I would lose A LOT of hair because it was so tangled due to dryness), and it dried feeling soft and smelling great.  I highly recommend this product, and I plan on continuing to buy!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used! I will buy this product again. Makes my hair very soft and shiny</li>
    <li> I DONT know what happened. I just got one conditioner. I have already left the massage to the seller to send a shampoo to me. However, they said I need to move off my review then tehy will return the full refund to me. However, I removed the reviews. They don&#x27;t send another shampoo to me. They don&#x27;t give the full refund to me. This is a CHEATING behavior. A business man will not do that. You are cheaters. NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCTS AGAIN!!!!!!!!! CHEATING CUSTOMERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> ONE OF THE BEST PRODUCT LINE I&#x27;VE EVER USED!!! SMELLS AMAZING!!! HAIR FEELS WONDERFUL!!!</li>
    <li> Leaves my coarse hair soft and manageable - highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not little skeptical if this is the real product. I&#x27;m thinking of asking my friend considering she used to use morrocanoil all the time.</li>
    <li> Received on time and as described.</li>
    <li> This Product is Amazing!  I got it because of my frizzy curly hair.  It helps kept my hair hydrated and the frizz away!</li>
    <li> As an older lady with the beginning of gray hair, this product really tamed the frizzed.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo and conditioner.  Makes my hair feel so full.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is awful. It smells great but it was so drying my hair felt like it was going to break while I was washing it. Will not use this shampoo again.</li>
    <li> Love this - and it came quickly and in good shape!!! Makes my hair smooth along with my curls!!</li>
    <li> Shampoo spilled everywhere in the box.</li>
    <li> The product ships quickly which is good because I always wait until I have one squirt left. However, I&#x27;m curious as to why the product does not come with the orange top. I&#x27;ve read several reviews about the product not being authentic... I&#x27;m beginning to wonder???</li>
    <li> I love this product it smells great and leave my hair and my hair extensions smelling great. I would most defiantly recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> My daughter has a lot of thick hair and this is her preferred brand. Her hair is noticeably shinier and more manageable. Wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey however.</li>
    <li> best shampoo and rinse out there.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Really like this product. Has a real nice sent also.</li>
    <li> I love both of them. They came quickly. But, shampoo lid was open a little inside package bottles and inside package were covered with shampoo. That is why only 4stars.</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo and Conditioner!! Gentle and moisturizing!</li>
    <li> Great product, but did dry my hair out a bit. However, in the long run, it has been greattttt. I used it only for a short time and then conssitently used the mask (1 time a week). Highly recommend Moroccanoil Products!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected....love love this shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
    <li> Immediate positive difference in my Hair and Scalp dryness. Helped a lot. Not having dandruff problems as i used to a few months back.</li>
