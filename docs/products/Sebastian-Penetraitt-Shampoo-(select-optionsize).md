<li> Finally, after a few months, my hair was in TERRIBLE condition.</li>
<li> I thought maybe it had settled because I couldn&#x27;t imagine a seller sending false product, so I shook it and used it for a bit.</li>

    <li> Love this stuff. Makes hair so clean. Smells great! Great for my long hair. Perfectly paired with the conditioner also.</li>
    <li> Amazing Shampoo. I truly love this stuff. My hair is so soft and manageable with this shampoo. I live in a very cold, dry climate, so this shampoo has done wonders for my static cling. I would recommend this product to anyone! I also use the Sabastian strengthing and repair conditioner. I love this brand. You can really tell a difference in your hair compared to the grocery store brands!</li>
    <li> it cleans the hair very well, it&#x27;s soft and creamy, not heavy and smells so good. I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good value for the price paid.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a year now, and this is my first time purchasing it online. I am almost positive this isn&#x27;t the real shampoo I use. The consistency feels so different. This shampo is really watery and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair soft as it usually does. The scent doesn&#x27;t even last. It usually lasts for days and as soon as my hair dried it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything. I know this shampoo and this isn&#x27;t it. I don&#x27;t think this shampoo is legit. At least not the one you guys sent me.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is good, smelling and froths easily. He prepares the hair to be treated by the mask and result is strong hair again.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE this shampoo line. My hair feels and looks healthy, and is stronger overall. Won&#x27;t use any other shampoo now. Makes a HUGE difference.</li>
    <li> I have thick, course, curly hair and this shampoo, as well as the conditioner, work fantastic at moisturizing and smoothing my hair.</li>
    <li> Great....packed nice with no damage.</li>
    <li> Works wonders, the only shampoo i will ever use, I have tried other salon quality shampoo&#x27;s/conditioners and I always go back to this</li>
    <li> This has been the best shampoo ever it leaves your hair smooth and none of that frizzy business . its worth it !</li>
    <li> This is an interesting shampoo. First, it smells wonderful and feels like silk in your hands. When you put it in your hair, it tends to clean and lather well. But then, here is where I run into a problem. After I rinse this product out of my hair, it tends to feel dry to almost brittle. The natural oils in my hair seem to be stripped. So, I end up using almost twice as much conditioner to replace moisture back into my hair and de-tangle it. Ugh, What is the point of me using twice as much conditioner if this product is supposed to be strengthening and repairing my hair??? No thank you, I will definitely not buy this product ever again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo since 2003. It&#x27;s the best brand ever!</li>
    <li> Bought for my mom who is very picky with her hair products and she said she loves it. Her hair is long and curly.</li>
    <li> Like the other 1 star review, I received this shampoo and it is NOT the same. I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years and this is not the same smell or consistency. I thought maybe it had settled because I couldn&#x27;t imagine a seller sending false product, so I shook it and used it for a bit. Finally, after a few months, my hair was in TERRIBLE condition. My hairdresser noticed the changed and asked me if I had switched shampoo. I said no and we were both puzzled until she asked where I bought my last bottle. When I told her, she immediately asked to see the bottle, I brought it to her and we compared and it is 100% not Sebastian shampoo. I&#x27;m not as upset about the loss of money as I am the quality of my hair. Very upsetting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands, but this product is the best!!! really works and helped my hair to recover its shine</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and it still works great! I would recommend this to anyone who has color treated hair.</li>
