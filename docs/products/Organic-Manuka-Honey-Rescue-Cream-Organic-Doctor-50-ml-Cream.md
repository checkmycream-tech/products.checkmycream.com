      <li>The best part...</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>This cream works great on my eczema!!</li>
      <li>This cream is incredible!</li>
      <li>and it was the best choice</li>
      <li>/&gt;i haven&#x27;t found anything that works for my eyelid eczema, but of all that i&#x27;ve tried, mustela steleopia line probably worked the best.</li>
      <li>product, I have to say again, had been perfect.</li>
      <li>So if you expect miracles for your eczema, don&#x27;t; but this is the best solution I found.</li>
      <li>this is a perfect lotion for me.  </li>
      <li>It did not help mine, but it smells wonderful and is a good moisturizer.</li>
      <li>thing I will say, is that it has a great smell to it.</li>
      <li>I ordered this after reading a blog that said it works great for eczema around the eyes.</li>
      <li>not as great as the reviews and forums led to believe.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing, has a great smell, and gets the job done.</li>
      <li>smells great, has a cooling affect on skin, and my skin is noticeably softer.</li>
      <li>Great Stuff.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s kind of incredible.  </li>
      <li>Probably a good cream, but it does nothing for eyelid eczema.</li>
      <li>because it&#x27;s good to keep your eyelids hydrated anyway.</li>
      <li>Good moisturizer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-Tamanu cream I bought from a store called Nature&#x27;s Boundaries (great for eyes/face but doesn&#x27;t get rid of the dryness as effectively as the Manuka honey cream.)</li>
      <li>My beloved Aveeno cream did not help at all to soothe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The is a superior product for my skin that doesn&#x27;t cost a zillion dollars.</li>
      <li>Love this beyond anything for eczema!  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>or I never read the box, because it features many non-organic and harmful ingredients!</li>
      <li>My eyes look MUCH better in the morning!</li>
      <li>Regardless, I&#x27;m keeping it - it does smell amazing</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>Smells nice though.</li>
      <li>daughter tried it while she was visiting and liked it better than me, so I passed it along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s very light, as is the cream itself.</li>
      <li>Anything to make my eyes look healthy again.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff</li>
      <li>reviews raved about this product, and most notably it&#x27;s &amp;#34;miraculous&amp;#34; ability to sooth eczema.</li>
      <li>Also, it appears that some customers have had allergy problems with it, so make sure to test it</li>
      <li>I do better with aquaphor.  </li>
      <li>glad it just doesn&#x27;t for me</li>
      <li>even so, i wouldn&#x27;t give mustela more than 3 stars.</li>
      <li>love the smell</li>
      <li>/&gt;-emu oil (ok for hands and eyes).&lt;br /&gt;-Vitamin</li>
      <li>The cream seems ok</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to sink into my skin in a meaningful way.  </li>
      <li>Better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
      <li>After trying this cream and falling equally as in love with it, she hopes to add it to her stock for her clients.</li>
      <li>HAPPYHOLLY!:)</li>
      <li>I put a good layer right before going to bed and let my skin absorb it during the night.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s rich, smells wonderful, and helped to mitigate the dryness, although it did NOT get rid of it completely.</li>
      <li>So far so good!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never seen my eczema heal so fast, this stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>, i have very mild eczema compared to this lady.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s easily found so if you need something urgent for your hands you might as well buy it.</li>
      <li>It is a good moisturizer for normal skin, but I do not recommend this for eye eczema.</li>
      <li>This product is pretty nice.  </li>
      <li>where Neve Campbell&#x27;s character goes to the doctor after casting that beauty spell, and the burn scar tissue on her back just starts peeling off and revealing beautiful, smooth, glowing skin underneath?</li>
      <li>Mild, for the most part.</li>
      <li>Out of desperation I finally tried Cortizone 10 eczema cream and it greatly improved my condition.</li>
      <li>I am comfortable putting it under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>The skin around my eyes is so smooth now</li>
      <li>/&gt;So smooth.</li>
      <li>rather than let it goto waste, I have discovered it makes a wonderful foot cream!</li>
      <li>, it is the best for everyday soothing and moisture.  </li>
      <li>Good idea to always test products there anyways if you have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>minutes later, my eyes were remarkably better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall, great product and definitely worth a try</li>
      <li>E oil is cheap and found everywhere, but doesn&#x27;t work better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, although it&#x27;s normally recommended for dryness.</li>
      <li>And an unexpected side benefit is that it smells wonderful and made my skin really moist and soft.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
      <li>nice, natural honey scent.</li>
      <li>I love this cream so much</li>
      <li>/&gt;Like, super legit.  </li>
      <li>This cream does not burn my eyes, and it is super hydrating.</li>
      <li>Luckily, I found BeeFriendly products, though they&#x27;re not specifically for Eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this cream for 2 years now and for a long time I loved it...</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a fantastic moisturizer for the rest of my skin (particularly in winter, I bet!).</li>
      <li>I tried it a couple of times and it tended to irritate rather than calm.  </li>
      <li>and I had to get a prescription for a steroid to calm the allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If it worked, it&#x27;d be worth $1 million to</li>
      <li>This is one product that was definitely worth the price to me.</li>
      <li>Its rich and smooth, but not heavy.</li>
      <li>I am still trying to find the right combo of this and vaseline.  </li>
      <li>It moisturizes a lot better than the Olay I used prior for 15 years.</li>
      <li>i recently broke out in eczema on my face (first time in over 10 years) and wasn&#x27;t able to use the lotion prescribed by my doctor around my eyes, since it would cause me to have glaucoma or something.</li>
      <li>I am still waiting to wake up from the lovely dream of finally having something to control the eczema on my eyelids.....</li>
      <li>It smoothed my skin and kept it moisturized for longer than most creams, but the redness, irritation, and itching stayed the same.</li>
      <li>if anything, i think it irritated it more because the cream is too hydrating, if that&#x27;s possible.</li>
      <li>It has been two weeks since I purchased this and nothing has improved despite consistent use.</li>
      <li>Her knowledge of pharmaceuticals has pushed her greatly towards homeopathic products since she witnesses the negative effects that prescription and over-the-counter medicines have had on the pharmacy&#x27;s customers.</li>
      <li>I have severe skin allergies and this is the one product my skin absolutely loves!</li>
      <li>I did test on the inside of my arm first</li>
      <li>I used more of this cream and four days later my eyes are about 90% healed.</li>
      <li>With much anticipation, I eagerly applied it to my eyes/face -- only to quickly feel my skin tighten and see my face turn bright red.</li>
      <li>as there are a plethora of things that can cause this kind of irritation around the eyes, and due to a lack of health insurance, I have yet to go to a dermatologist).  </li>
      <li>and my eyes are pretty much healed.</li>
      <li>Paw cream (better for hands since very thick, but also ok for eyes, and not too expensive)&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge believer in organic products and tried everything under the sun, and they still didn&#x27;t hydrate my eyelids and it was starting to spread to my cheeks.</li>
      <li>It has really helped with the eczema around my eye.  </li>
      <li>it didnt really work for me.</li>
      <li>From the reviews, I was really hoping that this would solve all our problems.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> HALLELUJAH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never had issues with my skin other than normal harmonious breakouts and a little too much oil-(I am 24). Then one day the neutrogena face bar for acne prone skin that I had been using for at least 6 months, gave me a terrible* allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt; So after the reaction calmed, I was left with imbalanced, troubled skin that reacted off of everything. I bought so many foundations, ranging from 10-45$, same with face washes, lotions etc.&lt;br /&gt;my eyes were flaky and raw and red and swollen and I could no longer wear makeup because I wanted to scratch my eyes out. I&#x27;m a huge believer in organic products and tried everything under the sun, and they still didn&#x27;t hydrate my eyelids and it was starting to spread to my cheeks. I saw that infamous blog and took another chance since it&#x27;s only 12$ and it was the best choice I&#x27;ve ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell, it&#x27;s very light, as is the cream itself. I put it on my cheeks and never break out. I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily call it soothing, but after one day, my flakes were gone. It&#x27;s been about two weeks and my eyes are pretty much healed. I only apply it once in the morning and when I go to bed. I will continue to buy this and use it daily even though my eyes are healed- because it&#x27;s good to keep your eyelids hydrated anyway. 😊&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be afraid to buy, as it&#x27;s well worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading.</li>
    <li> I, like many of these reviews, randomly started to get EXTREMELY dry skin around my eyes. I&#x27;m used to getting dry skin in the winter; my legs, my arms, my face, my whole body overall. Mild, for the most part. But this year, my eyes... red, swollen-looking, it was like the creases under my eyes were dramatically enhanced. As far as I know, I&#x27;ve never had eczema. This seemed like all of the eczema symptoms and I couldn&#x27;t tell I was being impacted by the cold, dry winter, the dryness in my office, etc. I bought a humidifier for my office, I used face lotions, eye creams, various organic oils... nothing worked. The closest fix seemed to be coconut oil which works wonders on my body and face, less so around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only 24-years old... there&#x27;s no reason I should look like I&#x27;m 80-years old. One day, I was so embarrassed by one of my eyes that I wore an eye patch to work. My little pirate self did a massive amount of research and discovered a blog written by a girl from the UK who found her &amp;#34;savior&amp;#34; for her eczema.&lt;br /&gt;http://wishingfortreats.blogspot.com/2013/11/my-eczema-saviour-dr-organic-manuka.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the ingredients (all-natural!), I was deadset on ordering this ASAP. So I did. Two days later (Prime!), it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five minutes later, my eyes were remarkably better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a few one star reviews for the people who were allergic to this product for one reason or another. I was not allergic to this product. This Manuka Honey Rescue Cream saved my eyes. I carry it with me everywhere. The best part... I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO APPLY IT EVERY DAY! Initially, I liberally applied it around my eyes multiple times a day. Now I only need to once in a while. I can use it for the rest of my face, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: my mother is a pharmacist and a myofascial release therapist. Her knowledge of pharmaceuticals has pushed her greatly towards homeopathic products since she witnesses the negative effects that prescription and over-the-counter medicines have had on the pharmacy&#x27;s customers. She sells homeopathic alternatives at her massage therapy center. After trying this cream and falling equally as in love with it, she hopes to add it to her stock for her clients.</li>
    <li> I have suddenly gotten eczema under my eyes and it&#x27;s pretty awful overall.  I love this cream so much it&#x27;s kind of incredible.  Why don&#x27;t you marry it, you might ask.  I would.  I would totally marry the hell out of it.  So there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, this is about as natural as you can get.  I am comfortable putting it under my eyes.  I like that I can actually read the ingredients instead of wondering if that 15 syllable word basically stands for smearing cancer all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin under my eyes lost the super itchy, dry, flaking skin along with the puffiness and red the same day I started applying it.  Instead of feeling ugly and tortured, I now feel like I have an island of refreshing under my eyes, where everyone swims about in the fountain of youth, thinking nothing but positive thoughts while sighing in delight.</li>
    <li> It is a good moisturizer for normal skin, but I do not recommend this for eye eczema. The results from using this were so so, but eye eczema is a much deeper skin problem than one that can be fixed from a cream. I prefer Cerave lotions and Aquaphor to ease the pain and redness of eczema.</li>
    <li> The listed ingredients shown here are INCOMPLETE.  Although it says, &amp;#34;No artificial colours, fragrances or harsh preservatives&amp;#34; under &amp;#34;About Product&amp;#34;, the ingredients listed on the actual box are: Aloe barbadensis leaf juice, water, cetearyl alcohol, glycerin, cetearyl glucoside, borago officinalis seed oil, beeswax, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, brassica campestris (rapeseed) sterols, zinc oxide, rosa moschata seed oil, honey extract (manuka honey), theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, sodium hyaluronate, glycyrrhetinic acid, glyceryl caprylate, tocopheryl acetate, sodium phytate, xanthan gum, FRAGRANCE, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, citric acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a heads up for those with fragrance allergies!</li>
    <li> Like others, I have eczema around my eyes and on my hands every winter and have been searching high and low for a cream that helps. I&#x27;ve been buying this cream for 2 years now and for a long time I loved it... it&#x27;s rich, smells wonderful, and helped to mitigate the dryness, although it did NOT get rid of it completely. So if you expect miracles for your eczema, don&#x27;t; but this is the best solution I found. Also, it appears that some customers have had allergy problems with it, so make sure to test it first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED AUGUST, 2016: After using this for almost 2 years I read the ingredient list on the BOX rather than the jar. Either they changed something or I never read the box, because it features many non-organic and harmful ingredients! Luckily, I found BeeFriendly products, though they&#x27;re not specifically for Eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m listing some other options below:&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve tried and liked:&lt;br /&gt;-Paw Paw cream (better for hands since very thick, but also ok for eyes, and not too expensive)&lt;br /&gt;-Tamanu cream I bought from a store called Nature&#x27;s Boundaries (great for eyes/face but doesn&#x27;t get rid of the dryness as effectively as the Manuka honey cream.) NOTE: Do NOT buy the concentrate- I think it&#x27;s for the use of cosmetic makers rather than product users.&lt;br /&gt;-emu oil (ok for hands and eyes).&lt;br /&gt;-Vitamin E oil is cheap and found everywhere, but doesn&#x27;t work better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, although it&#x27;s normally recommended for dryness. However, it&#x27;s easily found so if you need something urgent for your hands you might as well buy it. It&#x27;s too thick to use under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No product, I have to say again, had been perfect. Especially for my hands-- the dryness stays no matter WHAT I use, even the medicated creams.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this cream would be helpful for dry, eczema skin.  Even with the organic ingredients, it burned my sensitive irritated skin.  I tried it a couple of times and it tended to irritate rather than calm.  It is also very greasy and would only be viable for use at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter tried it while she was visiting and liked it better than me, so I passed it along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will say, is that it has a great smell to it.</li>
    <li> This cream is incredible! I&#x27;ve had eczema all of my life, usually on my inner elbows or neck, for the 8 years I&#x27;d kept it really well under control (almost no occurences of it) using the basic Aveeno lotion in the cream/green bottle. A few weeks ago I woke up woth eczema all around my eyes- something that had never happened before. My beloved Aveeno cream did not help at all to soothe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I googled around a bit and foundmany people recommending this cream, so I bought it, put it on several times the first day and before bed, when I woke up all the scaliness and peeling skin was nearly gone! Within a week my eyes were 85% better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went camping and the campfire irritated the healing skin. I used more of this cream and four days later my eyes are about 90% healed. I&#x27;ve never seen my eczema heal so fast, this stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> I found this product after searching for something to get rid of my terrible winter eczema around my eyes.  I had been trying doubling up on my face lotion and slathering Neosporin on overnight, but nothing was working.  After reading a blog article about this rescue cream&#x27;s miraculous healing powers, I decided to go ahead and splurge the $25.  If it worked, it&#x27;d be worth $1 million to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like, super legit.  Do you remember that scene in &amp;#34;The Craft&amp;#34; where Neve Campbell&#x27;s character goes to the doctor after casting that beauty spell, and the burn scar tissue on her back just starts peeling off and revealing beautiful, smooth, glowing skin underneath? Yeah, it was like that.  Literally overnight the worst patches were gone.  GONE.  The skin around my eyes is so smooth now, it&#x27;s like Leon Phelps is living on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So smooth.</li>
    <li> After working in the yard, I developed eczema around the eyes. This cream quickly and totally wiped it out! I highly recommend this product! It&#x27;s moisturizing, has a great smell, and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> My son has bad eye eczema in the winter.  From the reviews, I was really hoping that this would solve all our problems.  After using it for two nights, it not only helped but made it worse.  It does go on nice and thick, but just didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
    <li> Helped clear the eczema on my eyelids. Love this stuff</li>
    <li> This product is pretty nice.  It has really helped with the eczema around my eye.  My only complaint is that it is not as hydrating I would like and my skin is still very dry. I am still trying to find the right combo of this and vaseline.  Overall, great product and definitely worth a try if you have eczema around your eyes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream because one of the reviews said that it helped with eczema.  It did not help mine, but it smells wonderful and is a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I had developed a small dry patchy area under my eye. This product was recommended and worked. I use it for periodic moisture boosts all over my face too. Its rich and smooth, but not heavy. This is a product I will use regularly.</li>
    <li> I am still waiting to wake up from the lovely dream of finally having something to control the eczema on my eyelids..... Not an extreme case by no means and especially compared to what I&#x27;ve seen, but so irritating to have and have had it for about 6 mths now and also on and around my lips.........spend 3/4 days clearing it up with the typical H2 and other products purchased from the drugstore and then enjoy 3/4 days of clearing and then do it all over again...........was making me crazy!!!  So what I wish especially is to remember the girls blog that I came across that recommended this .......... I just cannot thank her enough for sharing her story.... and cannot recommend this product enough.......HAPPYHOLLY!:)</li>
    <li> Great product! nice, natural honey scent. i recently broke out in eczema on my face (first time in over 10 years) and wasn&#x27;t able to use the lotion prescribed by my doctor around my eyes, since it would cause me to have glaucoma or something. but this product was safe to use around my eyes and cleared up the eczema within a few days.</li>
    <li> Made my eyelid dermatitis worse. Probably a good cream, but it does nothing for eyelid eczema.</li>
    <li> smells great, has a cooling affect on skin, and my skin is noticeably softer. Purchased this for my eczema, I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I admit that I bought this cream completely out of desperation. I&#x27;ve recently experienced a horrible bout of eczema on my face and particularly around my eyes. I figured that this was worth the risk of purchasing when a few internet articles and dozens of Amazon, etc. reviews raved about this product, and most notably it&#x27;s &amp;#34;miraculous&amp;#34; ability to sooth eczema. I regrettably must say that this did little to nothing to relieve my eczema flare. It smoothed my skin and kept it moisturized for longer than most creams, but the redness, irritation, and itching stayed the same. It has been two weeks since I purchased this and nothing has improved despite consistent use. Regardless, I&#x27;m keeping it - it does smell amazing and it&#x27;s a fantastic moisturizer for the rest of my skin (particularly in winter, I bet!). Bottom line - I would not buy into the &amp;#34;miraculous eczema cure&amp;#34; hype. The product itself does not claim to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; eczema. Stick with your doctor&#x27;s recommendations or an eczema specific creme.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use it over my whole face as moisturizer twice daily and my skin is so much nicer, brighter, smoother and just glowing. It moisturizes a lot better than the Olay I used prior for 15 years. I highly recommend this especially if you have any dryness, flaking or sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Bought for eczema - atopic dermatitis. Been using for almost a month. Nothing. Good moisturizer. That&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> The Manuka Honey Rescue Cream works on my dry skin. I was in New Zealand last year and purchased the Lip Balm and have been a customer ever since. The is a superior product for my skin that doesn&#x27;t cost a zillion dollars.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was recommended for eczema on my hands and around my eyes.  I have always used cortisone creams in the past, but I worry about cortisone, even topically--and especially around my eyes!--and the truth is that while it stopped the itching most of the time, it never really cleared up.  After using this cream for two weeks, my eczema was just gone.  I was really surprised.  And an unexpected side benefit is that it smells wonderful and made my skin really moist and soft.  This is one product that was definitely worth the price to me.</li>
    <li> Bought this product because some girl wrote it helped her eczema around the eyes...&lt;br /&gt;Well i&#x27;m seriously allergic to this product. Both times I attempted to use this product, my eye became swollen shut and I had to get a prescription for a steroid to calm the allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the next one. If you have eczema, this product is probably not for you.</li>
    <li> So far so good!  I have been using hydrocortizone around my eyes for 1+ years due to severe dryness that results in pain, inability to wear makeup, redness, and scales.  Yuck!  (I won&#x27;t say &amp;#34;eczema&amp;#34; as there are a plethora of things that can cause this kind of irritation around the eyes, and due to a lack of health insurance, I have yet to go to a dermatologist).  I recently read that hydrocortizone is very damaging with long term use, so did research and ran into the famous/infamous blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it works for me so far!  Typically, if I stop using the hydrocortizone for 2-3 days my eyes would flare up again, and it would take a week to get them back to normal with the hydrocortizone.  This Organic Docotor Manuka Honey Rescue Cream has been working for 1+ weeks.  There is no pain, dryness, etc.  5 stars!</li>
    <li> Count me in the group that was trying this for eczema around the eyes.  And count me as a person for whom it didn&#x27;t work.  The cream seems ok--I didn&#x27;t have a bad reaction, but it dried on the surface of the skin quickly, and it didn&#x27;t clear up my skin problem at all.  I do better with aquaphor.  If it works for you--great.  But not for me.  Bummer because this cream was expensive!</li>
    <li> The only thing I&#x27;ll put on my face!  I have severe skin allergies and this is the one product my skin absolutely loves!</li>
    <li> I would not say this is an eczema problem solver. Smells nice though.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like it but this product has fragrance I have really bad face eczema it didnt really work for me. I ended up going to the dermatologist and getting medication for my eyelid eczema. :( if it works fkr you im glad it just doesn&#x27;t for me</li>
    <li> Seeing the doctor about upper eyelid dryness, but this product has been a godsend for the past eight months in relieving the itching and disguising the redness of my upper eye lids.</li>
    <li> not as great as the reviews and forums led to believe. disappointed. applying it almost every hour because it absorbs quickly but still leaves skin very dry.</li>
    <li> My daughter has severe eczema and this cream helped to relieve it.  She has tried several products and rated this one really high.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after reading a blog that said it works great for eczema around the eyes. At first it seemed like a life saver but after a few days the eczema around my eyes was not as bad as it was but not as improved as I had hoped. The cream also made my eyelids feel &amp;#34;heavy.&amp;#34;  I have tried everything - coconut oil, safflower oil, Neosporin eczema lotion, nivea soft cream... Out of desperation I finally tried Cortizone 10 eczema cream and it greatly improved my condition. I&#x27;m not happy about the steroids in the cream so throughout the day I do alternate between the two creams and it seems to be working. Anything to make my eyes look healthy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I had a small bout with eyelid eczema and since I couldn&#x27;t use any other product due to the warning labels to keep out of eyes, this stuff came to my rescue. I use it nightly and it turned my skin around immediately. Within just a few days the eczema was gone.</li>
    <li> Worked on my eyes just like other reviewers.  I did test on the inside of my arm first though based on some reviews.  Good idea to always test products there anyways if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love this beyond anything for eczema!  I had it on my eyes this spring and this was the only thing to clear it up.  Although I&#x27;ve been religiously using this for about 6 mos, it has yet to clear up the eczema on my inner elbow.  I do have to say though, it is the best for everyday soothing and moisture.  Better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used and Ive had eczema since birth.  Im not into using the medicated or prescribed steroids etc.. this is a perfect lotion for me.  I use it in very small amounts.</li>
    <li> Great Stuff. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
    <li> Had bad eye exmuh, smells good and hydrates well just didn&#x27;t fix my problem. Also a quarter of the jar was missing didn&#x27;t seem new. It&#x27;s already small as it is don&#x27;t know why they would have air in it. Also only really 60% organic</li>
    <li> I am a 47 year old African-American female who began experiencing eczema around my eyes.  Dry and itchy patches began to discolor my skin.  I started researching remedies for my condition on the internet and came upon this rescue cream on a blog.  Naturally, I checked to see if Amazon carried it.  In less than a week, my eye lids began to clear up and the itching stopped.  I now only need to use it when I&#x27;ve consumed dairy products (which I&#x27;ve since discovered are triggers for the flare ups).  Now, I use the Manuka Honey Rescue Cream along with Kiehl&#x27;s creamy eye treatment (with avocado), as part of my skin regimen.  Both are an answer to my prayers!!</li>
    <li> you&#x27;re probably here because you googled &amp;#34;eyelid eczema&amp;#34; and some blogger said that this was the only thing that cured her outbreak. well, that was why i was here and why i bought this cream. and i had really high hopes considering all of the positive reviews for this product. however, it didn&#x27;t work for me. not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you know which blog i am talking about, i have very mild eczema compared to this lady. it get littie red bumps in the inner and outer corners of my eyelids which are itchy and then get red and swollen. i&#x27;ve tried everything that people recommend - aquaphor, shea butter, mustela, aveeno, i&#x27;ve even tried putting hydrocortisone on it, but then got too scared about damaging my skin. so, i decided to try this product. every night and every morning, i put it on the eyelids. it did absolutely nothing. if anything, i think it irritated it more because the cream is too hydrating, if that&#x27;s possible. so much so that in the morning, my eyelids are actually puffy from the cream, like i cried myself to sleep at night. and although i said &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34;, i tried it on my nose, dried out from having a cold, and it did nothing to moisturize the flaky skin. very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i haven&#x27;t found anything that works for my eyelid eczema, but of all that i&#x27;ve tried, mustela steleopia line probably worked the best. even so, i wouldn&#x27;t give mustela more than 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream because I have extremely dry skin under my eyes which is prone to lining, despite being only 25 years old. This product was toted, in a now in-famous blog post floating the internetz, as being a miracle cure for sensitive/dry under eyes. With much anticipation, I eagerly applied it to my eyes/face -- only to quickly feel my skin tighten and see my face turn bright red. I have NEVER had an allergic reaction to any sort of skin product before, let alone one created SPECIFICALLY for dry/sensitive skin. Will not be re-purchasing. Side note: rather than let it goto waste, I have discovered it makes a wonderful foot cream!</li>
    <li> This cream works great on my eczema!! I have eczema in the inner portion of my arms as well as on my eyelids. This cream does not burn my eyes, and it is super hydrating. I put a good layer right before going to bed and let my skin absorb it during the night. My eyes look MUCH better in the morning!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work quite as well as I had hoped.  It didn&#x27;t seem to sink into my skin in a meaningful way.  I&#x27;d apply it at night and wake up without the moisterizing I&#x27;d hoped.  I bought this due to reviews stating it was good for slight skin rashes but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
