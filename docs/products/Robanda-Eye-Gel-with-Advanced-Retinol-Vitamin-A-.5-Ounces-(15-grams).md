<li> Not a good product for this.</li>
<li> it makes look tired.</li>
<li> i was disappointed as it arrived without a sealed lid.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I use this under my eyes at night before I go to bed..I wake up and my bags and dark cirlces are almost completely diminished..I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I keep a jar of this in the door of my refrigerator. I bought it at Marshalls for six bucks! Actually, I bought 3 jars. If you have puffy eyes every once in awhile (from crying or toxins), Robanda eye gel is for you. I&#x27;m 50 &amp; I&#x27;ve tried every eye cream that exists. This is the best. No frills, just clear blue advanced Retinol Vitamin A. You&#x27;ll see &amp; feel immediate improvement, &amp; when you use it over months, you&#x27;ll start getting compliments on what great \\&quot;young skin genes\\&quot; you have. ;D The blue color gives you an instant visual improvement &amp; makes you look more awake. You&#x27;ll love this product, even at full retail price!</li>
    <li> This really works! I use it at night and when I wake up my eyes are not as puffy and my dark cirlcles are lighter.</li>
    <li> I have been putting this gel on the skin around my eyes for over two weeks now and it doesn&#x27;t make that delicate area red or sensitive like other creams I&#x27;ve tried. It does feel fresh after applying but I&#x27;ll have to wait longer to see if there are any noticeable results.</li>
    <li> I use it daily. I look more radiant!</li>
    <li> This item did nothing for me, did not change the eye area at all.  Still have dark circles and wrinkles.  Not a good product for this.</li>
    <li> This eye cream seems to work well. I have only used it for a few days so probably need to use longer before can give an valid review.. However there are no negative aspects noted..</li>
    <li> I have deep set eyes, great dark circles and puffiness.. I have really noticed a difference with this eye gel...My make up doesn&#x27;t seep into it either.. I have used some expensive brands and none as good as this. I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s got an preventative powers (but then do any of the others really?) but it feels good.. Great idea to store it in the fridge.. Putting mine in there now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this eye gel for 2 weeks, but in conjunction with the moisturizer, I noticed the wrinkles around my eyes are less noticeable.  I will continue to use this product with the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Bought this recently in leiu of my 23 birthday- trying to be preventative! Instantly firming and moisturizing. I have used it once and my under eye wrinkles virtually disappeared. Looking forward to seeing what the long-term effects are!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the BOMB!!! It works so well under my eye makeup. Keeps my eye tissue well moisturized and helps&lt;br /&gt;with under eye bags and swelling.</li>
    <li> I love this gel for under my eyes. I keep it in my bathroom mini-fridge &amp; apply at bedtime for a cool sensation</li>
    <li> I saw almost immediate effects on my face.  I enjoy how it reduces the fine wrinkles on my face...I love the pleasant scent, and great for your wallet.</li>
    <li> For whatever reason, I have puffy eye lids. It makes me look older than I am. it makes look tired. I have tried many very pricey products. Nothing works as well as the Robanda Eye Gel. I apply morning and night and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> not sure how to rate this. i was disappointed as it arrived without a sealed lid. amazon is always SO TERRIFIC with&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s products so i was very surprised by this. not seeing any discernable results</li>
    <li> I see no difference nor do I feel any difference. When I apply this around my eyes it makes my eyes kinda sticky.&lt;br /&gt;THe jar it came in was a normal .5 oz jar but it was over half empty so not very happy with that either.</li>
    <li> I was not allergic to this product which is good.  But I didn&#x27;t see any results.  So, I will keep looking.  Genefique by Lancome is way more expensive, but at least it did something.  I have a LOT of samples of many lines and I have a lot more reviews to do.  Some are on totalbeauty.  I am liking Philosophy&#x27;s Eye Hope at the moment but I need more days to try it.  Sometimes, a cream can be fine and after 5 days, I will be allergic to it.  (I am 48, btw, as of the date of this review.)</li>
    <li> I had not noticed any change, even worst I have more fine lines around my eyes now, I&#x27;m not saying this cream is creating them, but is not helping at all.</li>
    <li> Like Robanda products.  Have not tried as I am still using another product.  Hope it works as well as the Serum.</li>
    <li> I originally found this eye gel locally, but then I was unable to find it.  So was happy to locate it on Amazon !  I find it to be a light &amp; easy to apply, &amp; takes very little each night, so it last quite awhile..</li>
