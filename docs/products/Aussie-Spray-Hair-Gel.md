      <li>It&#x27;s mostly 3B with some 3A.</li>
      <li>I love it and can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
      <li>I love the Aussie brand hair gels.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this gel for many years.  </li>
      <li>I get so many compliments.  </li>
      <li>Love the way it styles for me.</li>
      <li>Initially an appealing feature of this product was being fragrance free.</li>
      <li>I wish it was available in more stores</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t flake and it washes out easily.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use in the tube instead of coming in a tub that gets gummed up every time.</li>
      <li>This creates body and texture with a strong hold.  </li>
      <li>Hands down, it is the best gel I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Great product and does not dry out hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is also baby fine which adds to my hair dilemma.  </li>
      <li>been using this for years now ,  great if you have thin and baby hair and smells great</li>
      <li>Fantastic deal on Amazon.</li>
      <li>IMO this is preferable to what is available for men which smells like you bathed in cheap aftershave.</li>
      <li>On many people, straight short hair looks great, but not on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love short hair as I don&#x27;t have the talent and/or patience to work with my hair and make it look nice.  </li>
      <li>This is the only gel that eliminates frizz &amp; delivers perfect natural curls.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly.  </li>
      <li>This has a mild holding strength.</li>
      <li>Stores around me have stopped carrying it, so I am very thankful for Amazon!!</li>
      <li>Fast delivery!!</li>
      <li>I need something that does what I want, is broadly available, and reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth trying.</li>
      <li>Being a dude who grew up with a cool sister sharing her insight into all sorts of things a guy might not have a chance to learn I have experimented with many different brands.</li>
      <li>This gel is great for thick wavy hair.  </li>
      <li>They cost much more to purchase individually at the grocery store.</li>
      <li>I have short, fine hair that needs a lot of help.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a good volume boosting gel</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair and when it is longer it tends to frizz and not hold the curls.  </li>
      <li>My hair is straight as a board and has zero volume.  </li>
      <li>you need some shape and style to your otherwise straight hair, this is the product for you.  </li>
      <li>This gel really helps keep the curls in place.  </li>
      <li>So, I found this on AMAZON in a four pack and at a MUCH lower</li>
      <li>The hair doesn&#x27;t become encased in concrete or cripsy (unless I use too much), and it certainly isn&#x27;t floppy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other brands</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m one of those women getting older and seeing my hair thinning a bit</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recomend it.</li>
      <li>Thanks AUSSIE for helping to make this old broad look presentable !!</li>
      <li>When it&#x27;s hot and you are wearing one of those light-weight white mushroom type foo-foo hair nets?  </li>
      <li>I went back to the store where I purchased my first tube, but no luck.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this gives volume without a sticky mess.  </li>
      <li>Either way once it has dried you can comb it out with your fingers and end up with more natural looking body and fuller hair that retains a lot of the control the initial application infused.</li>
      <li>This product never dries out my hair, keeps it soft (no crunchy curls) and still hold my style all day.  </li>
      <li>This stuff allows me to groom it back (a more professional look) or allow it to look a little wild (more casual).  </li>
      <li>Every time I try something new, I always end up going back to this one.  </li>
      <li>A little sticky until dry, but washes out easily.  </li>
      <li>I would prefer a gel hat left my hair soft.</li>
      <li>I have thin hair and need more body which this product provides.</li>
      <li>I love how this product does not weigh down my hair, does not make it stiff.  </li>
      <li>This product also does not dry out my hair.</li>
      <li>Holds very well - a little bit sticky.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have fine hair and this gives volume without a sticky mess.  I don&#x27;t perm my hair and just use the styling gel and get nice waves.</li>
    <li> been using this for years now ,  great if you have thin and baby hair and smells great</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my wife who said it definitely does the job.</li>
    <li> Being a dude who grew up with a cool sister sharing her insight into all sorts of things a guy might not have a chance to learn I have experimented with many different brands. IMO this is preferable to what is available for men which smells like you bathed in cheap aftershave. This at least smells like something you might eat. And for some reason all of the products for men get flaky by the end of the day and you look like you have severe dandruff.  Initially an appealing feature of this product was being fragrance free. They have since pumped it up with a fruity watermelon? fragrance that reactivates if it gets wet or as you perspire and your hair is exposed to heat during the day. I have walked into offices and people have asked about the scent. I just say I was chewing fruit flavored gum.  This has a mild holding strength. It adds volume like they claim. You can put more on if  you need more strength. You can get a wet look or a dry look with careful application when you start with dry hair and add this to your hair in two applications that do not saturate it. Either way once it has dried you can comb it out with your fingers and end up with more natural looking body and fuller hair that retains a lot of the control the initial application infused. There are some products that lacquer your hair to your head and seem like they need paint thinner to remove. You might break your hair if you manage to move it at all. If you are looking for something to maintain spikes this is not for you.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the Aussie brand. Probably best hair gel I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
    <li> Great product and does not dry out hair. Fast delivery!!</li>
    <li> I have used this gel for a number of years.  I have very curly hair and when it is longer it tends to frizz and not hold the curls.  This gel really helps keep the curls in place.  My only complaint is that it leaves my hair a little stiff.  I would prefer a gel hat left my hair soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 years now and it is difficult to find in stores. I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it. Perfect hold and non-greasy. Only use a little.</li>
    <li> My favorite! It is getting harder and harder for me to find in stores! Love the texture it gives my hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for many years.  Every time I try something new, I always end up going back to this one.  I have short, fine hair that needs a lot of help.  This creates body and texture with a strong hold.  It&#x27;s perfect for blow drying. It also doesn&#x27;t flake and it washes out easily.  I think the hops is the secret to  this gel working so well. Definitely worth trying.</li>
    <li> This is the only gel that eliminates frizz &amp; delivers perfect natural curls. Stores around me have stopped carrying it, so I am very thankful for Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Arrived just as stated, very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Too Drying For dry hair.</li>
    <li> Holds very well - a little bit sticky.</li>
    <li> I love the Aussie brand hair gels. I&#x27;ve tried many other brands but I am super-pleased with Aussie gels. An outstanding brand and product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m thrilled that I found this styling gel. I cannot find it in the stores in my town. My hair responds well to this styling gel and I really do not want to find another one.</li>
    <li> Great price and works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Love the way it styles for me. Lightweight and adds texture. This product also does not dry out my hair.</li>
    <li> Works well for my type of hair (thick).  I have to combine it with hair spray to give it a firm and soft look.</li>
    <li> Great affordable product!  Shipped quickly.  Easy to use in the tube instead of coming in a tub that gets gummed up every time.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and need more body which this product provides. I love it and can&#x27;t be without it. I highly recomend it.</li>
    <li> What a bargain!&lt;br /&gt;Great quality product for an incredible price!  4 tubes so you can&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> I have very dry, curly, Irish hair. It&#x27;s mostly 3B with some 3A. I have tried basically every styling product I could find (from LA Looks, Queen Helene, Garnier Fructis, Tresemme, even Shea Moisture and DevaCurl). However, I always come back to this gel. Hands down, it is the best gel I have ever used. It leaves my curls well defined and shiny, something I have struggled for years and years to achieve. The price is outstanding and the hold is great. I just buy it in bulk on Amazon now because I have yet to find a better styling product for my hair. Aussie has given me great hair day after great hair day. I sincerely hope they never discontinue it!</li>
    <li> Personal grooming supplies are a very personal choice.  For me, I don&#x27;t like experimenting with a lot of different products.  I need something that does what I want, is broadly available, and reasonably priced.  This stuff fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;I have short hair that becomes a bit curly as it grows out.  This stuff allows me to groom it back (a more professional look) or allow it to look a little wild (more casual).  The hair doesn&#x27;t become encased in concrete or cripsy (unless I use too much), and it certainly isn&#x27;t floppy.  I apply it following showering for the best effect.  I find that it doesn&#x27;t work at all well without wetting my hair significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs: Inexpensive, reliable, good amount of hold without over-drying or over-firmness.  4-pack makes sure I don&#x27;t run out.&lt;br /&gt;CONs: 7 oz tube is beyond the 3 oz TSA limit for carrying on to airplanes.  Toward the end of the tube, it gets a bit thick and harder to use.  Adding a little water to the tube and shaking it up to mix fixes this.  Doesn&#x27;t work on my hair dry (but then almost nothing does).</li>
    <li> This gel is great for thick wavy hair.  I often curl it with a curling iron, and this is the only gel that doesn&#x27;t weight it down.  It really is amazing.  I wish it was available in more stores so I wouldn&#x27;t have to order it online!</li>
    <li> Fantastic deal on Amazon. These are my wife&#x27;s hair gel of choice and she refuses to use anything else. We will drive around town if they&#x27;re out of stock at our normal grocery store, which is common. They cost much more to purchase individually at the grocery store. I can&#x27;t speak to the specifics of the product since I didn&#x27;t use it myself, but my wife is very picky with her products and uses this religiously, so that should mean something.</li>
    <li> Aussie Aussome Volume Styling Gel -- 7 OUNCES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear my hair short and spiky and my problem?  My hair is straight as a board and has zero volume.  I mean absolutely NO volume and NO lift. My hair is also baby fine which adds to my hair dilemma.  I love short hair as I don&#x27;t have the talent and/or patience to work with my hair and make it look nice.  On many people, straight short hair looks great, but not on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I wash my hair I apply AUSSIE AUSSOME VOLUME STYLING GEL.  I then apply my make-up and after a bit my hair is ready to be dried.  Let me tell you -- this stuff adds ALL DAY volume and style to my hair.  After spiking and styling, I am good to go.  I love how this product does not weigh down my hair, does not make it stiff.  It has an almost non-odor and lasts all day long.  I am a school cafeteria manager and must wear a hair net from 6AM till approximately 11AM.  When it&#x27;s hot and you are wearing one of those light-weight white mushroom type foo-foo hair nets?  My hair is &#x27;restyled&#x27; due to heat.  After I remove my hair net, I simply fluff up my hair and I am good to go.  Love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled across this product at a local store and bought the only tube left.  When shopping at other places, I could not find this.  I went back to the store where I purchased my first tube, but no luck.  All the stores stock and carry other Aussie products, but not this one.  So, I found this on AMAZON in a four pack and at a MUCH lower price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need some shape and style to your otherwise straight hair, this is the product for you.  I have never been happier with a styling gel.  Thanks AUSSIE for helping to make this old broad look presentable !!</li>
    <li> Works great and washes out easily. Have been using this for years now. Great product. I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair lots of body and volume without weighing it down.  Helps hold in style and prevent the frizzies.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a good volume boosting gel and I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple years now.  Like others have said it&#x27;s harder to find at your local store.  I&#x27;m not sure if they are discontinuing the product but I recommend buying extra just in case.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Very good value.</li>
    <li> Item as described, shipped quickly, good quality gel. Very firm hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  They stopped carrying it in my local stores and so ordering from amazon was a must!  I have curly hair, and if you know anything about how difficult it is to style curly hair just so, then you know that once you find a product you love, you HAVE to have it. I get so many compliments.  People always ask me what curling iron I use to get my soft, spirals, and I answer that I don&#x27;t own one, they are shocked!  This product never dries out my hair, keeps it soft (no crunchy curls) and still hold my style all day.  I have tried expensive salon products and nothing comes close to what this product does for me. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those women getting older and seeing my hair thinning a bit and maybe just not as bouncy as it used to be.  This gel works great for me in keeping my hair tidy but lively.  Minimal smell.  A little goes a long way.  The ingredients don&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin.  A little sticky until dry, but washes out easily.  Best I have found so far.  And with Subscribe and Save I get it just when I need it.</li>
