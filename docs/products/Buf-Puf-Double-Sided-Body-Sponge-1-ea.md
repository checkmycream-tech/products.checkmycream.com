<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love these body sponges, they leave your skin feeling so smooth and soft without the harshness of some exfoliaters. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that these are a little pricey, other than that they do work well. You will notice a difference after using these and applying a moisturizer and any self tanners.</li>
    <li> Great buy. It works very well and I would highly recommend it for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this thing, except for one \\&quot;small\\&quot; problem - literally.    It&#x27;s too small for my hands. I am an average sized male with average-sized hands, but this thing is too small for my hands.. Sure, it works and I use it every day, but if they just made it a little bigger (30% maybe?) it would be perfect.    Other than that, no complaints. I use the rough side for everything, though people with more gentle skin will probably want to use the softer side most of the time.</li>
    <li> My skin feels like silk and it used to be pretty rough. Using a Buf Puf is 1000x more effective than high priced, wimpy, fleeting \\&quot;scrubs\\&quot;, lasts longer and is easier to travel with. I like the fancy new bath things as much as the next girl, but Buf Puf works better than anything else I have tried. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Using it lightly on your hands makes them look years younger. Using a facial Buf Puf has really helped me with acne. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If I had to give up everything but soap and 1 other bath product, I would choose my Buf Puf. The Buf Puf Company deserves the Nobel Prize for this one.</li>
    <li> I have been using Buf Pufs since I was in my twenties...thats 40 years.  Obviously I love, love this product.  I highly recommend if you want soft, clear, clean skin!</li>
    <li> Not really what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Great for exfoliating your skin. Would like it better if it were pear-shaped like the facial sponge</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for exfoliating. But the product price is not worth it for the rate of deterioration. Maybe if the sponge was a bit bigger.</li>
    <li> I love these! I have had the handle (which is no longer available that I can find) for over 20 years. These are gentle (not scratchy like brushes I have tried) and yet they are rough enough for cleansing with your soap choice. The handle makes it easy to use on your back, feet and legs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Buf-Puf for 25 years and my soft, supple skin is a testament to it&#x27;s quality - exfoliant, shaving cream &#x27;maker&#x27;, softener, etc.  Buf-Puf does it all.  If you haven&#x27;t tried this product yet you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd time I&#x27;ve purchased this item and I absolutely LOVE IT. I feel cleaner and I love expunging myself of my dead skin-cells. I really like that I&#x27;ve found this item!! I intend to keep buying.</li>
    <li> This really works well. It reminds me of a product from 50 years ago for the same purpose. Looking forward to showering with it.</li>
    <li> It is great in the shower.!</li>
    <li> Our family has used Buf-Puf body sponges for years and were very upset when we were unable to find it any longer in stores. Hence, we have shopped here at Amazon for them.  And now we are quite happy.  If you want smooth, silky skin, then this is the product for you.  For those who say that this product is too rough on the skin, we disagree.  There are two sides to every coin...uh, we mean...buf-puf -- if the blue side is too much for you, then use the white one.  We use the blue - always.  Just a week of scrubbing and your skin will love you...and so will your significant other.  Hey, you don&#x27;t even have to do this every day.  Twice a week is maintenance enough.  Just lotion up afterwards and even you will not be able to keep your hands off yourself.  Ahem!</li>
    <li> It was too coarse, even the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; side, so I went back to an OCELLO sponge and like it more.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Really excellent.  I looked long &amp; hard for the perfect bath sponge -- not too wimpy, not too harsh, got to fit between my toes... the Buf-Puf comes closest to meeting my \\&quot;ideal\\&quot;.  Yet it&#x27;s not perfect: it&#x27;s too small.  3M would be smart to come up with another version, twice the size (Buf-Puf-Plus), not thicker, just more surface area.  Another idea: Buf-Puf-Plus-Pocket, with a separation between the layers to hold a bar of soap.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly. The pad itself was a very, very hard piece of nylon/polyester. I understand how to use all facial products, I read all instructions. I have never understood why companies put out such horrible products like these buf-puf pads. If you are looking to rub off your epidermis layer and expose all that is underneath, then this is for you. My face was on fire after using this pad. The only thing this pad is good for is cleaning soap scum off of your tub.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Buf-Puf back scrubber before and bought this as a refill.  I really like this back scrubber above others that I have had.</li>
    <li> These have always been great for keeping your skin feeling smooth and soft.  Right now, this is the only place I can find to buy them.  Why aren&#x27;t they in every drug/beauty store around? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Great for feet, keeping legs free of ingrown hairs, keeping elbows smooth.  Use one with mint body scrub for an invigorating \\&quot;wake-up\\&quot; shower. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for exfoliation. I use it to get rid of dull, flaky winter dried skin on my legs and arms.  In combination with a good exfoliating body wash my skin is now smooth, soft and silky. I had trouble finding the Buf-Puf body sponge in my local drug store or chain store, but I knew I would find it on Amazon.  And the price, including the shipping, is comparable to what I used to pay at the drug store.  I definitely recommend the Buf-Puf body sponge for getting and maintaining a clean, clear complexion all over.</li>
    <li> I found this a bit small for me but it does have good exfoliation qualities.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had one for about 5 years and you can tell it from my skin condition, especially since my skin has changed from age. I&#x27;ve always used the regular buf on my face though they state it&#x27;s too rough. It&#x27;s just called just not scrubbing your skin. They last for years. This size fits my entire hand to the finger tips. I purchased this to cut in half to make 2 buf-pufs at a cheaper price then I could purchase them for.</li>
    <li> This buff has two sides - the white side has just enough coarseness to do a good job of cleaning.  The blue side is way to rough for me.  With two sides, it works fine.  It is large so that it holds a lot of soap.  Very nice size to fit in a man&#x27;s hand.  I like using this in the shower in the morning - it gets my beard loosened up and then it is easier to get a nice save.</li>
    <li> Great for exfoliation, super scrubby on one side, gentler on the other. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I have not seen this Buf-Puf replacement sponge in stores for a long while and was happy to find it here.  The price was appropriate and it fit the Buf-Puf handle perfectly.</li>
    <li> useless. These kinds of products will never legitimately clean your skin. Any one with dry skin. If you are using a soap or sponge in the bath and your skin still has cracks, that means it is not cleaning you. Use a korean italy towel I bought one on ebay for 2.99. Soaked in the tub for 20, and Dirt actually came off. Dry skin cracks in my leg and eczema scars faded by 1/3 after the first time. (note I was in there for over an hour)</li>
    <li> Nothing special. Didn&#x27;t exfoliate well and got slimy from soap despite rinsing.</li>
    <li> Little pad that does a good job of cleaning up your skin - just don&#x27;t rub too hard.  Well worth having!</li>
    <li> I have the back scrubber but the sponge was getting worn out. This popped right in and I am happy with it as a replacement.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for cleaning my acne prone back and shoulders.  Actually, it&#x27;s the only product that seems to work.  I use it in combination with the buf puf back scrub handle that makes it easy to scrub hard to reach areas.  The sponge may seem a little harsh at first, but that&#x27;s what makes it work so good.  The softer products I&#x27;ve tried just don&#x27;t seem to do the job.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I will be back to buy this product again and and again. You cannot find this product in the stores. I was very pleased to find it here. I will be a multiple purchaser.  I highly recommend this product for exfoliation.</li>
    <li> I have been using Buf-Puf sponges for more than thirty five years  and would not give them up.  The man-made fibers mean no bacterial build-up on the sponge, they air dry quickly, and do a daily job of exfoliating my skin.  The two sided sponge has a softer side for face and delicate areas and the blue side is rougher for arms, legs and tougher skin areas.  Using this sponge daily will keep your skin smooth and exfoliated.  You can use it with any type of soap, bar or liquid.  I travel with a Buf-Puf so I never have to use a questionable cloth washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend Buf-Puf sponges to achieve that healthy glow from daily exfoliation.  You do have to use it for a few days to get the stiffness rubbed out, but once you are use to it you will love the benefits from all over daily exfoliation.  I live in a dry climate where we must use daily moisturizers.  Using the Buf-Puf to shed the dry skin allows body lotions to do their work and keep my skin baby soft, pores clean and when asked why I have no wrinkles at age 60, I say, drinks lots of water and use a Buf-Puf.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Buf Puf since I was in college (over 20 years ago) and for all of my adult life many people have commmented on my glowing, youthful skin. I give much credit to this little buf puf. It was developed by a leading dermatologist, I believe his name was Dr. Orentreich. Cleansing grains, exfoliating creams and other wasteful products just do a so-so job. With this puff you control the degree of polishing and exfoliating you desire. I wish I could give it 10 stars. It is simply the BEST!!!</li>
    <li> Bought it to replace a Jergins bath sponge - it&#x27;s a little too coarse and not really flexible enough to use on your face. It will scour off dirt and exfoliate on the rest of your body. You really need avoid sensitive areas.</li>
    <li> Very nice, but wears out and expensive</li>
    <li> I really like this sponge, it cleans the body great, but the price is to high! We should get at least 2 each sponges for the price.  I&#x27;ll be looking for similar items that are less expensive to use in the future.</li>
    <li> I love these.  They help you get good and clean</li>
    <li> I love this buff puff. Amazon is the only place that carries it. I use the white side on my face and the blue harsher side on my body. Great for exfoliation. It keeps my skin silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I really like this for taking off dry skin on elbows and feet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these Buf-Puf Double Sided Body Sponges for over thirty years.  I used to find them in local stores, but have not been able to for over 20 years.  I was so excited to find them on this website.  I actually made a mistake when ordering them.  I meant to order the ones with the handle, but ordered the sponge refills instead.  No problem, I will use them anyway.  These are the best thing for back acne.  No bath brush or loofah can compare.</li>
    <li> Received and happy with order.</li>
    <li> Excellent, should have ordered more!</li>
    <li> While spring cleaning, I came across my old Buf-Puf handle.  I had forgotten all about the Buf-Puf and how good it works.  It was wonderful to see it still being sold.  Besides doing a super job of keeping your skin clean, it also is great for using if you have been outside in areas with ticks.  Years ago, I would visit a wooded area, where there were deer, and pick up tiny, tiny ticks, without knowing they were on me.  It was only after scrubbing with this body sponge, that I would see the itty-bitty ticks caught up in the Buf-Puf.  Then, I would just rinse them down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Buf-Puf sponge I received this week is just like the old one--same shape, same size.  Thus, it fits my old Buf-Puf back scrub handle.  I&#x27;m really glad I kept it, since Amazon and every other place online seems to no longer have any \\&quot;Buf-Puf Back Scrub Body Sponge with Reusable Handle\\&quot;.  Besides having a white side to scrub your skin, the body sponge also has a \\&quot;tougher\\&quot; blue side to scrub your feet.  I had forgotten, too, what a nice job it does on summer feet, when shoes are worn only when absolutely necessary.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product, price, and delivery!</li>
    <li> I like the exfoliation I get with the sponge but wish it was a bit bigger.  I tend to switch between this and my regular pouf.</li>
    <li> Great body sponge, one side is really rough and leaves you baby smooth, the other side a little less rough. Works great on its own or with the handle.</li>
    <li> Does what I wanted it to...exfoliates face with less abrasive side. Other side could be used if you want stronger exfoliation. Dries well on shelf in the shower.</li>
    <li> Great product, even better than I had expected. I believe it will last a while. Really cleanses your skin. Best I ever used</li>
    <li> I always used the sponges you can get at any store and never felt like they really did anything.  This sponge is great, my legs feel smooth after each use. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Use them every  day.  Eventually they flatten so I use them to scrub the tub and shower.</li>
    <li> The best product ever for the shower.  It gets all dead skin off and makes my skin smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> I prefer very exfoliating sponges and scrubs and these were not so. I guess they may be ok for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Great sponge for my body brush that works great in the tub.  I need to order again soon because the last one is on the brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Buf-puf products for many years, and was very happy to find that they were available thru Amazon.com.  It arrived quickly, and has already been put into use.</li>
    <li> I use the body sponge on my face (using the softer side) and it works GREAT to exfoliate my skin.  I use a bit of baking soda worked lightly in to the pad.  This visibly exfoliates leaving my skin clean, pores are temporarily smaller and the surface of my skin is smoother.  Keep one in the shower too  and use it with the coarser side for my body.  I rarely give a 5 star review.  I also have a Clarisonic facial brush I use on a regular basis.  But love the addition of this Buf Puf in my facial skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I love this product and can no longer find it in local stores. This product has been around since the 70&#x27;s and I love it! It is an excellent exfoliator of rough skin without using chemical product. Though to rough for sensitive dry skin, it works well on the rough areas like the bumpy skin on the back or arms and legs. Looking forward to ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the praise this product gets. It feels like the Brillo pad I use to scour pots, and is horribly abrasive to my skin. I used this for a week with the hopes I would acclimatize but I did not. It also doesn&#x27;t enable the soap to produce much lather -- the product just sinks to the middle and then takes forever to rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually had a good laugh when I saw it was made by 3M -- I think this could probably be used to prep a car for new paint in the bodyshop. No way would I ever recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product.  It meets my expectation.  It did not disappoint me.  I love using it.  I really don&#x27;t have any complaints about it.  I just love using it.</li>
    <li> I love Buf-Puf sponges. I&#x27;ve used so many different loofahs, sponges, poufs , scrubbers etc. and nothing compares to these. They are the best for exfoliation and thoroughly cleaning your skin. Combined with your body wash, this sponge will make your skin very smooth and soft. My skin has never looked this healthy! You can never find Buf-Puf products in stores anymore, so I&#x27;m relieved that I can always find these here on Amazon. I highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t the body sponge I want to use daily so that search is still on but it works well to exfoliate after shaving my legs.  It feels good then and as my Grandmother would say &amp;#34;Gets the old blood flowing&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Use it every time I shower - blue side on body, white side on face.  Does a great job of removing dry skin leaving pink, smooth skin behind.  Plan to use these from this point forward.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge! I use it every other day in the shower. I wash with the white side first and then the blue side. I do this all other my body. It takes a little while so that&#x27;s why I just do it every other day. My skin is sooo soft and it glistens in the sun as well. I barely need any lotion and when I do put on lotion it makes my skin even softer.  It is also helping the blemishes on my back go away. I used to be able to feel little pimples on my back, but I don&#x27;t feel them anymore.</li>
    <li> Exfoliates really nicely!</li>
    <li> I am happy with this sponge, but it is a little rougher than other sponges I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I simply use it with a lighter touch and it works good for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blue side is very good for the feet!</li>
    <li> Ah, the Buf-Puf. I genuinely cannot remember what I used before these. I suppose it was some caveman tool, or an archaic loofah-esque object. But gone are those dark ages. They&#x27;ve been polished shiny and new by the Buf-Puf. This thing is awesome. Makes me squeaky clean. I don&#x27;t even use lotion anymore because my skin is so soft and glowing after this scrubs off all the dead disgusting skin cells. I also use the face one. I like that they make one for every skin type. I actually have sensitive skin but find that this one is not too harsh. Couldn&#x27;t live without it! Order one today. Usually sharing is caring, but in this case it&#x27;s just gross. So actually...order more than one today!</li>
    <li> I have been using this little scrubber for 30-odd years! I read an article abt skin care in Cosmopolitan Magazine; a doctor said that if you only did ONE thing for your skin, it should be a Buf Puf. Used to buy them at the drugstore like everyone else, then when they stopped stocking them, I found them on the &#x27;net (like everyone else!). I love love love them, so does my daughter now, and in fact I couldn&#x27;t live without them. Hope Buf Puf doesn&#x27;t go out of business. Ever.</li>
    <li> These sponges are great for washing really dirty dishes.  However, they are very harsh on the skin.</li>
    <li> much too rough and harsh for me to use on my skin.  It feels like I&#x27;m rubbing myself raw.</li>
    <li> Very good for exfoliating and making the skin feel smooth and fresh. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> great for skin rejuvenation and cleaning, face, legs, neck etc.</li>
    <li> always love these for bathing.</li>
    <li> I am used to using an extra large sqrungee to which they are now extremely hard to get, so I thought I&#x27;d order 2 of these based on the reviews... I am using liquid soap on this sponge and I must say it does not lather up very well nor is it a good size for a full grown man.. Leave this one for the women and children IMHO...</li>
    <li> One of these was recommended by a doctor for my face - especially near my nose.  It is working out very nicely.  It is soft enough for my face, yet rough enough to take care of my problem area.  Extremely easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sponge for 30 years. Save your money and buy this and use it with a good antibacterial soap to exfollate your skin, face and body. Skin will be clear, blemish free, with a rosy glow.</li>
    <li> Great site to order Buff Puffs that are no longer available locally. This product is superior for smoothing skin and exfoliating, especially the new bath size.</li>
    <li> The sponge is the perfect size and the perfect shape. It fits well in your hands and it does the job right. I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Good quality, good price.</li>
    <li> Nice body scrub sponge and it lasts for a long time.  Great (with its handle) for those who can&#x27;t reach their backs.  Highly recommended.  (Get the one that comes with the handle).</li>
    <li> I use this twice a week to exfoliate my skin and brighten my tattoos! Don&#x27;t scrub too hard, easy!! I use the rougher side for my feet and elbows!! Awesome, feels so good and makes my skin so soft. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past; this purchase was a replacement.  I have the long handled back scrubber to which it attaches.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Every day I use them, when my local drug store stopped carrying them, I has to find a new place to get them. Found them here</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only brand sponge that truly deeply removes dead skin so you don&#x27;t have to do it daily (which is a marketing ploy plus harmful). Keep vertical in open space to dry, don&#x27;t squeeze it to death. It&#x27;s been around all my life, way before they started making the silly plastic puff balls that harbor tons of bacteria &amp; those scratchy bath mitts that can slice your skin open. If you don&#x27;t itch while scrubbing, or turn red, then you&#x27;re not really exfoliating.</li>
    <li> I wanted a shower puff that can exfoliate and have a softer side, and this is the one. Makes it easy to reach when you buy the whole kit, but having extras available to refill is great!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on largely good reviews. I was so disappointed when this arrived. It looks and feels like the batting used in quilts or an old teddy bear. I have now used it three times, and it is already fraying. It does not hold lather at all, I had to resoap THREE times, even though I was not directly in running water. Once wet it is flimsy, and feels as incredibly synthetic as it looks. Even with a lot of soap it does not rub smoothly over the skin.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t possibly use any other sponge now. My skin feels so fresh and so clean clean, so fresh and so clean!</li>
    <li> These are great for exfoliation which is important in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t quite figure out what this item should be used for. I purchased this to use on the rougher parts of my feet, and to see if I can find a shower product that replaces the poofy shower sponges, but I found a poor substitute for both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one, this does state that it has two sides to it. One for softer applications, the other for more rough patches of skin. However, both were much too rough to use anywhere but the tougher parts of skin. On the flip side, if you are looking for something to smooth down calluses, this is simply not rough enough and one should look to a pumice stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this sponge tries to do everything, and ends up doing it all poorly. If you really need a body sponge, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my granddaughter, who loves them.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, plus another softer Buf-Puf for my face.&lt;br /&gt;Does wonders for taking off dried skin, and I just feel wonderfully clean afterwards. It also preps your skin well for your favorite lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I use the Buf-Puf handle and attach this sponge to wash my back.&lt;br /&gt;After many years, I am used to it, but for a first time user, stick to the softer white side and use a gentle touch.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great exfoliate for the the body!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a dish sponge, yes, you read that right, a dish sponge to wash my body in the shower.  Granted it&#x27;s a nice spong, the kind that has a mesh lining on it and costs about $3 at my local grocery store...but I thought it was time to commit, to an actual body sponge.  I&#x27;d read on here, after researching, that the Buf-Puf Double sided body sponge was pretty awesome, so I went ahead and ordered it.  I&#x27;ve used it 2x only and I have to say, I get excited (don&#x27;t look into this too much please) about scrubbing down in the shower now ;-) I also hate mushy soap and use most soaps that come out of a container but a friend gave me a beautiful bar of soap and this scrubber grabs the soap so it&#x27;s left fairly dry (the soap) and doesn&#x27;t just sit there (like I&#x27;d let it) and build up into a soapy mush.  The sponge is definitely a strong scrub on one side, good for elbows, legs and maybe your hard to reach places on your back.  The other side is soft enough to use on your face, neck, inner arms etc.  Overall, I love this little sponge!</li>
    <li> I started using this product in my early teens.  I have to admit that it has helped me maintain my youthful appearance.  They sold it in Walmart at one time or the grocery stores, but now I have to order them on-line.  Each pad will last about 30 days, so I use 12 per year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product so much that I would even advertise it for free based on my testimoney.  I have no dead skin cells on my body and it has more than contributed to my youthful appearance.  I use it along with the O&#x27;lay Products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been told that my skin is as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product to go on my BP back scrubber for about 10 years. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have used buff puffs for years. I know that some people say they are rough.  I don&#x27;t feel clean without using one.  It is the best exfoliant that I have found.</li>
    <li> After trying the buf-puf I cannot use a regular sponge. Love these!</li>
    <li> Great for my back with tea tree soap. Keeps acne at bay.</li>
    <li> I use Renova daily and the Buf Puf Body sponge is THE BEST exfoliating sponge on the market for the &amp;#34;flakies&amp;#34; that come with Retin A use.  Even after two years of Renova, I still get the flakies and the sponge buffs them right off and my skin is incredible!  It lets makeup sit perfectly and my complexion is smooth and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely makes this 46 year old mama feel like a new woman!&lt;br /&gt;Highly, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This body sponge is the best I&#x27;ve tried and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> The choice of having rougher and smoother side is perfect for all skin types. The size is perfect. They dry fast, just wish there were multiples in each pack.</li>
    <li> I do like this sponge.  I like that it has a scrubbing side and a softer side and I like that is stays clean looking in your shower.  It also doesn&#x27;t ever get a musty smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t like that it flattened after about a week of use - this doesn&#x27;t affect the overall scrubbing action, but it just doesn&#x27;t look as nice.  It also doesn&#x27;t hold body wash well, so I usually have to start with 2 squirts at the beginning of my body and then add another squirt of body wash toward the middle.</li>
    <li> This makes my skin feel soo good. I love Buf-Pufs. They are the perfect exfoliation tool. It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
    <li> The Buf-Puf Double Sided Body Sponge works great-I have the handle and it sticks to it so you can use it on your back. Great!</li>
    <li> This is great for exfoliating. I can use it on my sensitive skin without irritation. You can even buy a back brush handle for it. This beats every loofah and bath puff I have ever tried. Rinses easily and lasts for a long time before needing replacement. Store brand knock-offs are not the same! Only caveat is not to use bath oils on it as you probably won&#x27;t be able rinse it out completely (and then you could end up with mildew).</li>
    <li> These are hard to find.  I was able to give one to each of my daughters as they last for a long time.  This is a great price.</li>
    <li> This double sided sponge is the best body sponge I have ever tried. Loofas are just too course. Buf-Puf knows how to get the job done  with out skin irriatation. The size is just right for you hand and the soft side works for my face. I always keep them on hand . I even pack one away for when I travel. Wash cloths are a thing of the past.</li>
    <li> Just wish there was a larger one.</li>
    <li> I use only Buf-puf and have for over thirty years.  I look for it and will buy only this product.</li>
    <li> I love using this sponge on my skin. It sits in my shower and I use it every day with a non-exfoliating body wash. If you use non-exfoliating body wash in the shower, I seriously recommend buying this sponge, because not only will you be wasting a whole lot less of it, you will also be exfoliating your skin every day (a good way to have healthy and smooth skin). It also is, to me, a much better alternative to all of the washcloths that you have to add to your laundry pile. These sponges last for usually about a month or so and have a softer side and a rough side. I use the rough side on my feet, knees, and elbows, but the rough side is really the most awesome for the soles of your feet! Even if you use bar soap, I still recommend this product, because exfoliation like this can help your skin out a lot.</li>
    <li> Good size but a little more rough than expected.</li>
    <li> I like how soft your skin feels after using the buf puf sponge. It is sad I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in stores.</li>
    <li> So happy there are body size but-pufs with the extra exfoliating side! The size &amp; &#x27;material&#x27; really does make a huge difference for the body. This is a smooth skin MUST.</li>
    <li> I have used Buf Puf brand skin sponges for years.  They are the only ones that really cleanse and smooth my skin and I have tried other off brands that just don&#x27;t hold up after a few uses.  Buf Puf holds up for months and works well as long as they are squeezed out and allowed to dry completely which is not a problem at all.</li>
</ol>
