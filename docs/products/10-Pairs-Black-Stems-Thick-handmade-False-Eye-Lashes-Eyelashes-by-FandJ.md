    <li> Very disappointed this looks nothing like that</li>
    <li> Excellent lashes. Way cheaper than Revelon&#x27;s or the ones at Walmart but of better quality. Just don&#x27;t apply the entire strip with the clear string on it because it annoys the eyes. The lashes must be taken off of the strip and placed on the eyes separately in MY opinion.  Other than that, great stuff. I say DEFINITELY buy here.</li>
