<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have loved this product for years and Amazon has a great deal on it.</li>
    <li> One of the best shampoos I have ever had for my thin dry hair.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for my hair. My hair is soft and looks so healthy again.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner!  Smells wonderful, too.  Leaves my course hair very soft.</li>
    <li> Not good for Oily hair-.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I bought this shampoo, I has used LUSH shampoo bar and Dove shampoo (for olily hair).&lt;br /&gt;I had no problems with those. This shampoo makes me soooooo oily.&lt;br /&gt;Just after you done shampoo it feels great, very soft.&lt;br /&gt;But minutes after, it pulls my curl down, and greasy.</li>
    <li> Salon quality Shampoo right here. It&#x27;s paradise putting it in my hair. One squirt and bam off to clean hair land I go. Leaves my hair really soft and nice looking with a clean look to it that I love. I love the smell of this stuff a hint of coconuts and fresh. Do you the favor and get you some Nexxus shampoo stuff is Paul Mitchell quality and a slightly cheaper cost hell I think this could very well be even better than Paul Mitchell. I&#x27;m not real sure on that though it&#x27;s been years since I was willing to fork over Paul Mitchell prices. Nexxus is salon quality and works well in my hair is what I do know. This is better than your Cheap grocery store brands or typical department store brands like Dove, White Rain, Pantene, Herbal essence, and all that jazz.</li>
    <li> You notice a positive difference from dry hair within two weeks.  After a month no more hair issues.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product</li>
    <li> Nothing special, Fructis works the same....yep....sad but true</li>
    <li> Good salon quality shampoo, pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I am Caucasian, I have long, straight, very nice hair that isn&#x27;t colored or treated in any way.&lt;br /&gt;This is my go to product after trying virtually everything you would find at Wal-Mart and some other stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided once to &amp;#34;splurge&amp;#34; on a nice shampoo and gave this line a shot, and haven&#x27;t looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed over the years some formula changes, especially fragrance which I feel is less pleasant, but it isn&#x27;t displeasing. Although I generally dislike any artificial fragrance, especially in care products. But so far nothing has turned me off from using the product.</li>
    <li> Wifes favorite brand at a good price.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t lather doesn&#x27;t rinse out clean . When I use Back to Basics or Paul Mitchell One my Hair feels clean I like that. Nexxus not so much.</li>
    <li> I have used Nexxus since I was a teen.  They have changed the formula to the point that I have to change to a different brand.  This barely suds anymore.  Leaves a horrible film on my hair and even on the shower floor.  Feels like they have put baby oil into the formula.  Yucky!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go back to the original formula and I will come back!!</li>
    <li> I always use Nexus products!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo at a local beauty supply store a year ago, and it was GREAT. It had great scent, moisturized without drying my hair, and I only needed a quarter-size amount to suds up my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran out recently and bought a new bottle, and I had to triple check to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a different shampoo (it isn&#x27;t). The consistency of the shampoo has changed from creamy to runny, the color has gone from milky white to dirty yellow, and the scent is barely there. On top of that, it requires at least 3 quarter-sized pumps of the shampoo to even suds up my hair a bit, and it dries out my hair, and makes it fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so disappointed in Nexxus. I attempted to find their contact information to speak to customer service and they don&#x27;t even provide a number or email address; all they offer is an automated response system that&#x27;s computerized. So I typed in, &amp;#34;Formulation change&amp;#34; and it came back with, &amp;#34;We often change our products to improve them based on customer feedback&amp;#34;. Really, Nexxus? So you decided to replace your working, quality product with a cheap imitation and charge the same price, and you think that&#x27;s what customers want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think again. Looking for alternate shampoos now. Do not recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: (January 2015) Nexxus has since changed the entire formulation of this shampoo. What once had rosemary oil in it (great for hair loss, conditioning) is now replaced with &amp;#34;caviar&amp;#34; and it sucks! The new formulation makes my hair fall out in gobs, my scalp itch, and my hair to look oily overnight. Wrote the company but received no response back. They&#x27;re not interested; they just keep advertising the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; formulation with a new model on television with great hair - yea, right, she uses this product! I&#x27;ve since been looking for a new shampoo and while Ojan shampoo is good, I have an allergic reaction to it so...still looking!</li>
    <li> Hair became brittle and coarse from using &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;this moisturized my hair back.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even use a conditioner anymore because this works so well.</li>
    <li> The reason you have not recieved this product is because it has been discountinued and reformulated to Phyto Organics Theratin Extreme Moisture Shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great product. I used to use inexpensive shampoos and conditioners. My hair feels much nicer using this product (and the shampoo too).</li>
    <li> It looks as though Nexxus reformulated this product and the Humectress conditioner. They both work very well and smell great.</li>
    <li> Price price price. Love this shampoo, but the price for the amount is why I order it here.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. It smells great and makes your hair soft. It also lathers really well.</li>
    <li> I have to edit my review. I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now. I feel like the shampoo and conditioner leAve my hair so oily and tangled. Hair loss has increased significantly since using this shampoo. I m going to stop using it and get something else. Big waste of money.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the scent. My hair seems to feel dirty and oily in no time.</li>
    <li> This is the same stuff I get in a salon, but cheaper. It makes my hair really soft and it smells good.</li>
    <li> All Nexxus products are excellent and I am highly satisfied with this one.  Thank you for makingg it available to your customers.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  Not all shampoos are the same.  After using a knockoff brand &amp;#34;just like the original&amp;#34; I found that was not true so I have returned and my hair is so much better.  Have placed my order on permanent shipping.  Not only am I assured I will get my supply, but you pay less also.  Don&#x27;t know what I didn&#x27;t look at Amazon sooner.</li>
    <li> I never ever write reviews for things but this &amp; the matching Humectress conditioner are absolutely incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my hair is a pain in the butt...it&#x27;s baby fine/thin, straight, gets oiley extremely fast and is also prone to getting dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently it was damaged from coloring and even more recently went through an accidental protein overload that left it dryer than usual.  It was oiley, extremely dry, had no shine and was losing color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a bunch of stuff to try and repair it but nothing really worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I stumbled on this and OMG I will never use anything else again.  After just two washes (using the conditioner as well) it was a night and day difference.  This stuff cleanses all the oil, intensly hydrates, restored colors &amp; shine and smells awesome too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Um...so yeah, worth every penny :)</li>
    <li> Garbage Walmart shampoo with a Salon price point... Absolutely ridiculous.</li>
    <li> leaves hair soft and easy to manage.  Used many shampoos and this one is the very best.  would not use anything else</li>
    <li> Was bummed out when I couldn&#x27;t find this in walgreen&#x27;s. CVS, or rite aid. Have used it for years.  Friends that visit and forget their shampoo always comment on how great their hair looks after using mine!</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USEING THIS SHAMPOO FOR A VERY LONG TIME I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE</li>
    <li> I ordered Nexxus Shampoo Therappe because I was having trouble finiding it at the store, it works well for my dry hair.</li>
    <li> My hair loves this so much</li>
    <li> I always loved the scent and texture of the shampoo my hair dresser used and realized it was this Nexxus Ultimate Moisturizing Shampoo. It has a healthy coconut scent and a luxurious texture. Your hair dries clean and soft. It&#x27;s easy to use and to travel with. I wash my hair about every day so wanted something which wasn&#x27;t too harsh. The extra moisturizing helps! If you want a salon-quality shampoo, you may want to sample this one.</li>
    <li> I do love this shampoo!!</li>
    <li> (THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE OLD FORMULA! New formula is crap and I am looking for something else now! I&#x27;m NOT happy about that Nexxus!)&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair that was very dry due to the hard water where I live. I desperately tried many brands of shampoo designed for moisturizing hair. None of them stood up to their claims. I decided to try Nexxus even though the cost is much more than I usually spend on hair products. I never liked paying so much because I have a LOT of hair and it&#x27;s long as well, (to my waist) and it doesn&#x27;t last long considering how much hair I have to shampoo. I took a chance on Nexxus by first buying a smaller bottle of the moisturizing shampoo and conditioner from my local beauty supply store and hoped for the best. I noticed after a week of use that my hair began to feel so much softer and looked very healthy and shiny. This shampoo lathers like a champ, and rinses out very cleanly with no residue feeling at all. I was very impressed by the results so I hopped on Amazon to see if I could find a larger bottle at a better value. I was delighted to find this 33 oz bottle for half the cost of the 13 oz bottle at the beauty supply store. This shampoo paired with the conditioner, and later used with the moisturizing leave-in spray, split end binder cream, and heat protector spray, my hair has completely transformed into a pleasure instead of a hindrance to me! I get compliments on my hair all the time now. Most people tell me how shiny it looks, and friends mention how soft it feels. I am very pleased with the results I&#x27;ve been getting and how fast I saw them. I love Nexxus!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is perfect for using once a week (or more if needed). I regularly use Nexxus Diametress Shampoo (and no conditioners). But sometimes (especially during the winter months) the Therappe Shampoo is needed when my hair feels dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Nexxus Shampoo (my favorite is the Diametress) for at least 3 decades. It is the best shampoo on the market. It really does keep the hair healthy and thick (thicker - because your hair is healthier).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Therappe Shampoo is perfect as a substitute for conditioners (I don&#x27;t like conditioners) - to be used in-between regular shampooing.  And for the size of the bottle - it lasts forever. Well worth the buy. I give it five stars!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for dry hair, mild sent</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best!  It is thick and lathers up really well.  It feels like your getting a spa treatment while washing your hair.  It rinses out easily and my hair looks clean, healthy and no tangles.  I follow up with a Nexxus Conditioner and between the two products I could not be happier. In fact before I discovered this product I was so frustrated with tangles and dry hair, I was ready to cut my hair short.  Really glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> Great price! I love this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo pretty exclusively for more than 30 years - I love it!  Nothing smells better.  I have allergies and sensitive skin but no problems ever with this product.</li>
    <li> It was open when I received it.</li>
    <li> nexus is always good!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this stuff... I just use it to wash my short hair... I buy it here because it&#x27;s convenient to have it delivered through Prime.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shampoo. He will not use anything else. He says it smells good and leaves his hair clean and not heavy.</li>
    <li> ive used many different brand shampoo, still like this most.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo for dry hair that needs gentle cleaning and it leaves your hair very shiny!</li>
    <li> Love the smell! My hair has never been so shiny!</li>
    <li> been using this for years - cleans well, my hair feels soft, without any oily feeling to it.</li>
    <li> I have always used and love this shampoo. My hair is dyed blonde and helps keep it healthy.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this shampoo exclusively and Amazon&#x27;s prices are the cheapest around.  When I placed this order on October 25th I knew that it wasn&#x27;t due to ship for 3-5 weeks.  However, I have continually received emails advising me that there is a delay in shipping....It&#x27;s an excellent product at an excellent price, however Amazon appears to be making promises that it can&#x27;t keep...[update] Today is April 9th, and the new ship date is April 21st...so....6 months.</li>
    <li> I would score this a 5, but I am not convinced it is the real thing.  Maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter, it smells and works like the stuff I use to get at the saloon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a couple times now. After reading reviews, I was skeptical and not sure it would work for me. However, it&#x27;s wonderful! It leaves my hair feeling very soft, fluffy, and I don&#x27;t feel like my hair tangles as much. I follow it up with a salon quality conditioner (with Keratin to strengthen and protect it).  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily, or greasy, at all. All I need is two pumps of the bottle, maybe silver dollar size (my hair is about 3 inches past my shoulders). I would have to say, so far I am very impressed.  I have very damaged hair; been foiling it blonde for many years. It&#x27;s also very fine, and thin, which also doesn&#x27;t help. I&#x27;ve been unsuccessful growing it out as it just breaks. : (  But now that I found this shampoo, I&#x27;m hoping it might help with the breakage. I would recommend this product!  So far, I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Is by far the best shampoo I have ever used period.  Hair is much softer and manageable.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used Nexus in a long time until the past two weeks.  I had tried three different other brands which claimed to smooth hair and stop the frizz, but they did not work.  I bought Nexxus Therappe shampoo and Humectris conditioner and got awesome results.  I let my red medium wavy coarse hair air dry and then just a little touch up with a curling iron.  I&#x27;m loving Nexxus!!!</li>
    <li> When used with the Humectress condition, I get the smoothest, sleekest hair ever and I naturally have very frizzy hair.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> i am sure she enjoyed it</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 15 years and just love how it works on my hair. Nice clean, soft and light scent of coconuts. Very happy Amazon has this item in the 34oz. size as you can&#x27;t get in the stores locally anymore.</li>
    <li> Allways like it&#x27;s smell and effects.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel like it has a film on it.</li>
    <li> This newer formula is nothing like it used to be. it has a waxy consistency , and doesn&#x27;t lather to my liking, also leaves a slight residue on my scalp , rather than a clean fresh feeling.  Dont waste your money.</li>
    <li> great shampoo smells good too</li>
    <li> Great price and quick delivery</li>
    <li> Great! Creamy and very moisturizing.  Love it!</li>
    <li> always a good product</li>
    <li> Whoever bought the new formula Ultimate Moisture and is unhappy about the change, this is your good news. I bought both that new formula Ultimate Moisture and this Therappe, and apparently they used the old Ultimate Moisture formula in this Therappe product. Change to this one if you are unsatisfied with the formula change in Ultimate Moisture.</li>
    <li> It is probably the least drying shampoo I have ever used and it left my hair feeling very soft and moisturised, but not in a good way. My hair did not look or feel clean after using this shampoo. I probably lean more towards the oily side, so that is probably the issue.</li>
    <li> good price on a good product</li>
    <li> Great stuff, puts moisture into my hair and the smell is coconut.</li>
    <li> Nexus is the best, I have been using it for years, and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Feels good on my hair!</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for 5-6 years and i really like it, but pick it up at a store ......... update pleased with unplugged for what ever reason product was couple days late arriving, but the company did right and refunded shipping cost. so i will give them benefit of the doubt and order again when need to.....thank you</li>
    <li> I have always loved the smell of this shampoo. It&#x27;s not too sweet...smells like coconut but not so overwhelming. It&#x27;s a creamy shampoo that suds up alot.</li>
    <li> As always, this stuff is great!  Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> Nexxus therappe shampoo works great! plus with the humectress conditioner they both put the moisture back into your hair leaving it soft, silky and manageable.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what Nexxus has done to Therappe shampoo but it doesn&#x27;t cleanse the hair, anymore.  This new formulation leaves a film on my hair that was never there in previous formulations.  It does the same thing to my kids hair, too.  I could pay a couple bucks and get that.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo.  Leaves your hair soft, shiny and smells great. You don&#x27;t need much to lather. Good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> big fan of this shampoo, isn&#x27;t too drying, and good smell to it. I have straight thick long oily hair and this shampoo product keeps the oil at bay</li>
    <li> your hair when wet doesn&#x27;t feel clean no sqeek feeling like you can&#x27;t rinse out soap.Aveeno shampoo much better</li>
    <li> Everything went as expected - no problems - The whole process was seamless - Even with a broken bottle, the replacement was seamless - as always the purchase was pleasant</li>
    <li> Very nice for dry hair.  As always, Nexxus is good stuff</li>
    <li> WOULDN&#x27;T USE ANYTHING ELSE</li>
    <li> Great product, very good price, and fast shipment</li>
    <li> Not for me! Huge disappointment.  That fake slippery feel on my hair and body really drives me nuts!!!</li>
    <li> The product packaging looked good and delivery was good but the actual shampoo was not as I remembered and I was not impressed.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, has never let me down!</li>
    <li> My hair looks and feels so much better after using this for a month or so!  A+++</li>
    <li> This shampoo is extremely rich and lathers beautifully.  Also, is rinses out well.</li>
    <li> Love the conditioner, but shampoo dries my hair</li>
    <li> a little goes a long way. lathers up quickly and makes hair super soft!</li>
    <li> my daughter likes this</li>
    <li> Really loved the feel and shine from this product.  Smelled good too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure glad I decided to tune out the negative reviews on this. As I recall there were a few that gave me pause, saying such things as the formulation changed, etc... (or course in all caps and whatnot, kind of a red flag to begin with). Anyway, despite those reviews I ordered one bottle and have been using it the past week. This is just what my hair needed. I&#x27;d been looking for a long time for something that would just dump moisture into my hair and this seems to really do it. I&#x27;ve used this product before but it was like 20 years ago (or thereabouts) and remember good experience with it, so I don&#x27;t know maybe the formulation has changed in all this time, but if it has maybe it has actually improved. Even the gas you put in your car is not the same thing it was 20 years ago I reckon.</li>
    <li> what a dissapointment.&lt;br /&gt;expected a lot more after the reviews and the cost.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the same shampoo/conditioner which retails for much less than this item for several years but was looking to up the softness of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Thought this line with the conditioner may help but alas not.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it not do anything for leaving my hair softer (I&#x27;m also using the conditioner), it somehow is greasy by day&#x27;s end.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I&#x27;d never bought it.</li>
    <li> The best product I have ever used, we have very hard water and my hair becomes so dry and unmanageable, even purchased a water softner with no change in my hair dryness. Have tried many products with none of them working. Used this shampoo, conditioner for past 3 weeks and have a huge improvement with my hair which is now not dry and manageable. I also use the deep conditioner 2x weekly and leave in conditioner daily. finally I found something that works for me!!!!</li>
