<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this product since I was 4 months pregnant (I am now 7 months). And although I don&#x27;t use it twice a day as recommended (I apply it every other day), my belly is always soft &amp; I have yet to see any stretch marks! I plan to keep using this after the baby is born too.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely incredible stuff! I have been using it now for six months and my skin as never looked better! Its a quater of the price of other face oils and totally brilliant!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s such a great product on my skin and on my hair. My hair is shiny after using the hair dryer. It also improves manageability of my hair. My skin tone has improved greatly. Recommended to friends and family and they are happy with the product.</li>
    <li> love it still use after pregnancy</li>
    <li> i have been using bio oil for a year now and trust me ma body looks good and it makes my stretch more lighter.the oil will not erase your stretch marks but atleast minimize it.the price too is not bad.</li>
    <li> It the best trust me.this not fake especially for stretch marks</li>
    <li> I bought this to prevent stretch marks on my pregnant belly. It worked great! I gained almost 30 pounds but the skin stayed moist and no marks. I recommend this to anyone. Now I&#x27;m almost done with my preg life but I will use this product for all over my body. It works great for dry skin anywhere on your body, I assure you!</li>
    <li> This is a product worth EVERY penny and i deffinately will be reordering. I have had stretch marks on my lower back and on my breasts ever since I lost a lot of weight in my late teens, that would just not go away. however sinse using bioil I have noticed that the stretch marks have significantly faded and in some spots vertually gone. very pleased with the outcome.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff about once a day, for about 3 months now. I got HORRIBLE stretch marks when I was pregnant all over my tummy. They were painful, deep, and red/purple. Now, they are no longer sensitive, have actually gotten less deep and are losing color more and more! I only went through one small bottle and got great results. I have now started applying it to my other stretch marks, and go through a lot more, but it&#x27;s so worth it! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I am in my second trimester now and have been using this product for about two weeks and can already see results! The stretch marks I got before receiving this product have already began to fade and get smaller! I hope that continued use will give even better results I will update after the birth of my baby with the results, but so far great product!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before, so I knew what I wanted.  The oil came earlier than I expected...which worked out great for me.  This exact product is sold in stores for a lot more, so needless to say...I am very happy with this order.</li>
    <li> I bought this product during my second pregnancy. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t know about this product during my first and my stomach looked like stretched out pizza dough! I decided to give this a try after using celtrixa and being unhappy with the result. I have used this for 2 months now, and only once a day because I find it most effective right after my morning shower. My stretch marks were once DARK red, now they are white, almost skin color. So far, I have not added any additional stretch marks and I am 8 months pregnant. The product is a little greasy, but isn&#x27;t that what oil is supposed to be like? I apply it right after I get out of the shower, while my skin is still very moist and I let it soak in for about 5 minutes before putting clothes on. You will not be disappointed with this product. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely Amazing! My stretch marks were very deep, large, and dark red. Just after a couple of months of using this product, my stretch marks are barely even noticable. A little goes a long way. This stuff is a miracle in a bottle!</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT.  MOISTURIZED SKIN VERY WELL AND IT HAS A VERY LIGHT, PLEASANT SCENT.  DOES NOT STAIN CLOTHING.</li>
    <li> I am about 6 months pregnant and my mom gave me this oil to use maybe a little over a month ago.  I did not have any stretch marks on my stomach to speak of, but I did have some prior ones on my hips from weight fluctuation in my teen years.  In hopes to squelch the chance of getting any, I had been using L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s Almond Oil every day, which is amazinggggg... but pricey.  At $30 a pop, I decided to maybe cut my week&#x27;s use in half by using the almond oil half the week and this Bio-Oil the other half - which is much cheaper and a great consistency that seems to last well.  I ran out of my L&#x27;Occitane so I had begun using only the Bio-Oil a few weeks ago and I have yet to notice much of a difference other than the fragrance, which is not too overpowering, just not as pleasant to me as the Almond Oil.  I will definitely be stocking up on this for the remainder of the pregnancy and well beyond!  It is oily and as other users recommend, I would suggest allowing time for the oil to soak into the skin before putting on clothes to get the full benefit.  I also oil down after my showers every morning to retain the moisture.</li>
    <li> Great thank you wonderful seller</li>
    <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, AAA+++</li>
    <li> love this product great for wrinkles, scars and dry skins.  I like to use it on my neck and some wrinkles on my forehead this works wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have melasma and some acne scarring.  I have had chemical peels, laser treatments and I have tried everything.  I use a little all over my face every morning and night.  I have received many compliments on how great my skin looks.  How soft it is, how the melasma is fading, and how the scars are fading too and it doesn&#x27;t make my face look greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> very good looking and comfortable to use it. Nice color. Awesome and i like it.Awesome and i like it very much.</li>
    <li> Bio-Oil seems like a great product but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily get rid of stretch marks. But it feels great on the skin.</li>
    <li> Love it. Affordable and works well I can see the results from 3mos of using it! I recommend it :)</li>
    <li> I have stretch marks on my thigh when I was growing, but Bio Oil didn&#x27;t has much impact on reduce them. Tried on other scars, haven&#x27;t see much obvious result yet. Or maybe this is solely for pregnant stretch marks?</li>
    <li> Love bio oil, was not happy with super long delivery. Didn&#x27;t realized where it was coming from. Again great product.</li>
    <li> I put this all over my belly 1-2 times daily and at 37 weeks I have absolutely no stretch marks on my stomach. However, I got them pretty bad on my hips which tells me this works.</li>
    <li> I was very happy the way it was handle. It came fast and it was what I wanted. Will be buying more.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and I just ordered 2 more bottles to get me through the 3rd and 4th trimester!  Yes, it is greasy, but it truly helps stretch marks and keep the skin glowing and soft.  I am VERY grateful for this product.</li>
    <li> Took a little longer than I would have liked to get here! But overall I love the product! It&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> I bought this product to treat my stretchmarks and I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6 months.I&#x27;m really happy with the result,my stretchmarks have definitely faded and has gotten lighter n less noticeable.You have to stick with it in order to get great results.I use mine 2 times a day.</li>
    <li> I started using bio oil during my 15 weeks of pregnany or so to avoid stretch marks and the product did not help. I had none in the begining I wanted to help avoid it but i woke up one day and there it was after using bio oil faithfully twice a day. I just started Maderma now because it help after my sugery and I can see a little bit of improvements on the color.</li>
    <li> I bought this to get rid of some stretch marks on my hips for summer, but no told me that the oil doesnt dry! I put it on 1st thing in the morning 40 min before I had to leave and it never dried and left me all greasy! it did help fade my stretch marks though, but I just hate that it never dried, and after about 3 hours of not sitting I had to pat it dry with a towel.</li>
    <li> I used it for about two weeks. The oil provide enough moisture for my skin, and I feel my acne mark is fading.</li>
    <li> LUV THIS STUFF ... I NEED MORE</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see a difference. Luckily my stretch marks aren&#x27;t bad cause I would be real hurt.</li>
    <li> I have used this product many times.. This is my second time ordering from this company! They are quick and the oil comes in full! Fast shipping! I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s helping my stretch marks from happening but i know that the current marks are getting lighter! I am 6 months pregnant with my second child &amp; with my first i did not put on oil like I do now after every shower. I try to do it 2x a day but with a toddler and working you lose your day quickly! But I recommend this to ease your mind. It&#x27;s not super expensive and it&#x27;s not cheap! Better than buying it at babies r us or Walmart because you can beat the price even with shipping! I saved this company for future purchases of this product only for when I run out and need to stock up again! Like I said try it and find out! It&#x27;s amazing stuff I say!</li>
    <li> Alright, first of all I am NEVER one to write a review about anything because I am just too cynical about products and all these scientific beauty break-through, no. Here&#x27;s my story, I am a female soldier in the US Army, I am currently deployed to Afghanistan where it&#x27;s so freaking dusty, dry and hot! We are in a remote area in a third-world country so the water supply is terrible, but the army has its ways. The water is non-potable and is used only for showering and laundry, the extremities. Due to the high amount of chlorine/bleach that is used to \\&quot;sterilize\\&quot; the water, my skin gets really dry and has a scaly look. It is so dry it burns at times and wrinkles. I also have scars from I was about 8 years old living in Jamaica (W.I.), I had chickenpox and I had soars all over. This next statement may be considered graphic be cautious: my chickenpox was so bad that the soars on my buttocks would stick on to my underwear and it wouldn&#x27;t heal...it was pretty bad trust me. I still have the scars to this day and I am now 21. I am not a big person but I have a few stretch marks since i went from 5 10\\&quot; 120lbs to 145 after basic combat training for the army. I stumbled upon bio-oil about 2 weeks ago and thank heavens! I am telling you, this product works for me and I could almost cry. By the second use I saw changes, I am not lying. I was astonished! Stretch marks GONE! Scars on my buttocks disappearing. Very faint. My skin is even and you know what I like most, it&#x27;s not that greasy because I am a person I hate oil/grease. I honestly only take care of my skin and lotion when I have a boyfriend (lol). This is pretty bad but yes, it is true. Bio-oil, I don&#x27;t know who your maker is but wow, thank God. I loveeee this product and I just ordered 2 more bottles. Was so mad when it took about a week and a half to arrive in Afghanistan. Phew! Please, this might not work for all, but it did for me so it is definitely worth the try. I recommend it to anyone, anyone race. I wish they had more line of products too...soaps etc.  Never used it on my face because like I said, I don&#x27;t like oil. Oh and my skin glows so much. The only other two products I ever felt stronly about was some Dove Body wash and I like Colgate total totohpaste products. WOW LOVE! TRY ITmore line of products too...soaps etc.  Never used it on my face because like I said, I don&#x27;t like oil. Oh and my skin glows so much. The only other two products I ever felt stronly about was some Dove Body wash and I like Colgate total totohpaste products. WOW LOVE! TRY IT</li>
    <li> Just what I expected. You sent it as described, Great product and reasonable price. It&#x27;s all worth it. Thanks very much.</li>
    <li> I was impressed w this product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard of so many stretch mark gimmicks, I didn&#x27;t expect this to work at all.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my stretch marks from my pregnancy n within two weeks they went from purple n deep to pink n more flush w my skin. It even helped w my naval ring scar!&lt;br /&gt;Love this&lt;br /&gt;Watch out though,it stains clothes!</li>
    <li> i have had this products for almost 3 weeks and i bought it to try and erase past acne scars on my face and shoulders and stretch marks all over my body. as of right now i am not noticing any changes but i should have done before pics to really monitor changes if any. i am just not sure. and i do use it am and pm.</li>
    <li> Suggested for dry skin, face esp with peeling, flaking on cheeks&lt;br /&gt;Put lightly mostly all over face at night or even casual days</li>
    <li> This is my first review for any product ever.  I have tried Proactiv, MaryKay, Oil of Olay and so on and so forth in an attempt to find a good facial regimine, and I&#x27;m not saying that they weren&#x27;t ok, but I did not get the results that I did with this Bio-Oil.  My skin is so soft and supple, the problem is, I can&#x27;t keep my hands off of it!! I have dark spots left over from pimples that have I&#x27;ve busted, that are clearing up nicely.  My husband commented the other day how nice my skin looked.  My pores are visibly smaller and the tone is amazing..very even and clear.  I still use a good cleanser (Mary Kay), exfoliant (baking soda or store-bought special), toner (Mary Kay) but I finish off my facial routine with a hydroquinone cream (lightening) and the Bio-Oil as a moisturizer.  To be honest I could probably go without the hydroquinone to fade my dark spots.  Up until today, I have only used this on my face (not sure what I&#x27;m going to do this summer, I know there is no way I will be able to use this in Atlanta heat) but starting this week I&#x27;m using over all my body. I will NEVER go without this product...EVER!</li>
    <li> I recommend this to many girls with uneven skin tone in the face area as it is really evening. I also use it in a bubble bath putting about a tbsp in the tub makes your skin suuuupppperrr smooth and ssoft! Best for winter dryness I have 2 bottles now and love them</li>
    <li> I purchased this from Costco.  After using it twice a day for a week I noticed that my facial skin was getting red,&lt;br /&gt;Is this a common problem and will it go away after more use?  I also found it to be very greesy.</li>
    <li> still hasnt faded my marks and i&#x27;m down to nothing.. i applied 2 days a day and I&#x27;m not convinced that it actually works.</li>
    <li> loved it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  xxxxx xxxx xxxx  xxxxx xxxx xxx xx</li>
    <li> smells nice, feels good. keeps skin moisturized but not for very long.  it dries up or gets absorbed within a short time. would need to re-apply several times in the day</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product! It works very well on scars and stretch marks and I can&#x27;t say enough great things about it! I&#x27;d just caution anyone buying Bio oil from Amazon to not use AmericaRx. They shipped mine unsecured in a soft sided envelope and it spilled out all over the envelope and came half empty. Even after sending pictures of the mess, along with the plastic bags my mail carrier had to deliver in, they would not send me another bottle and I even offered to ship back the half empty bottle! After many emails back and forth the best they would do was refund $5.00 (not even half of the purchase price) so I was forced to file a claim with Amazon. Amazon handled it quickly and I finally received a full refund but not without a lot of frustration first.</li>
    <li> This oil is the best oil in the world. I love it. I used during my hole pregnancy and I never get any stretch mark. I really recommend it!</li>
    <li> I bought Bio oil a couple of years ago, been using it now continously. I am a black women and I first bought it because my ankles and elbows was really dark and dry. I had used cocoa butter for a long time but it did not help. Got the Bio oil and started to use it twice a day for two weeks and it really worked. So now I use it on my legs with Nivea skin firming body lotion and it really helps them looking very smooth. Love this product and if you use it twice a day and take some before and after pics I bet u would be amazed. The down side it is oil so if you don&#x27;t mind the oilly feel then  u will love it. I put it on at 30 min to 1hr before I get dresses or lye down for bed and at that point it is fully absorbed into the skin for a less oilly feel.</li>
    <li> Im asian and after 2 months using twice daily barely any differnece, I know it says use it for 3 months but if it doesnt work for 2 months then another month wont make a difference.</li>
    <li> Really is a God oil, texture is oil, but do not feel the oil, it is easy to absorb and eliminate a lot of stretch marks, the amount of, and now one-third left, run out will definitely buy.</li>
    <li> To be honest I only ordered this because I needed something to fill out an order to get free shipping. Somehow this popped up as a suggestion by Amazon. I had used it in the past but very sporadically. I am 46 and have the usual issues of wrinkles and stretch marks plus some scarring from an awful skin condition a few years back. I just put it on my neck and chest one night because the super expensive cream I just bought made me break out so I figured what the heck. I had no expectations at all but when I glanced at my decollete in the mirror I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference. Now I slather it on my chest, neck and face all the time.  It also seems to be helping with frown lines, those things people use Botox for. I wear glasses and I suppose I&#x27;m always squinting because I really should have bifocals but don&#x27;t, hence the frown lines. I was really despairing of getting rid of them and now I am hopeful. Women spend so much money on our cosmetics, I have spent thousands and thousands of dollars over the course of my lifetime and here is an awesome product for less than 10 bucks. I just hope they keep making it and don&#x27;t jack up the price.</li>
    <li> Massaged this on breast surgery scar and all now I have yet to see a Difference  certainly didn&#x27;t work for me and I did it morning and evening</li>
    <li> I originally purchased elsewhere on sale with coupon, not expecting much, i started using on stretch marks and on knees where you start to age, (wrinkles), it wasn&#x27;t long after use that i actually noticed my knees looking smoother, you can hardly see the wrinkles now, i am 44 so it&#x27;s not like they were horrible, but still, the product helped me, i use everytime i get out of the shower for better results. The stretch marks are smoother and a bit less noticible, so i am very happy with bio-oil and will continue to use it every day, by the way, take whats left in your hand and rub through hair, it is excellent for smoothing the hair and with static cling!</li>
    <li> I used this from the day I found out I was pregnant until my son was about 6 months old religiously. I&#x27;ve always been very prone to scars and stretch marks so I was really surprised.  I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks until I was 8.5 months pregnant and I really think that part of the reason I didn&#x27;t is because of bio-oil. I&#x27;m currently 15 months postpartum and you can barely see my stretch marks. I will definitely be using this product again for my next pregnancy. I still use it from time to time.</li>
    <li> I read that bio oil has lavender oil in it, something that stalls new cells from forming. Maybe it&#x27;s not true but I didn&#x27;t find that it worked for stretch marks at all. What is working for me is excel stretch mark cream, vitamin c serum, pure cocoa and castor oil. Along with once a week treatment with a 1.5&amp;#34; derma roller. Bio oil may help with certain things but definitely not stretch marks</li>
    <li> Is good for Blemish, uneven skin tone and hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is a must have and must try product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My operation knife cut line has being there for 10+ years has lighten and almost gone for good.</li>
    <li> So far no stretch marks and keeps the pregnancy itching at bay! This vendor had great pricing and expedited quickly too.</li>
    <li> This product went down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;Felt greasy and did not disolve into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I found that the smell was not so nice.</li>
    <li> I had light stretch marks that were very noticeable when you touched the area. After 2 weeks I see they&#x27;re no longer raised and my skin is even to the touch and visibly, I loooovvveee this, it&#x27;s great! No regrets</li>
    <li> I got a steal! Love bio oil it does wonders for me and I&#x27;ll order more in the future. It came right on time too!</li>
    <li> Searching through the newspapers for coupons, I saw this product. Reading the product info made me interested. Now, I use Bio Oil everyday and I love it cause it penetrates quickly and clears my skin of dark spots. I was looking for a product that would be kind to my sensitive skin too. Bio Oil actually changed my skin from being de-hydrated to softer, more evenly toned, less noticeable stretch marks, better skin. Originally, I purchased it in a store but now I only buy it on Amazon cause it&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I always had a problem with rough skin on my lower legs. As a result, i started to have ingrown hair after any kind of hair removal procedure. I have tried all of possible moisturizers, but the one helped me was Bio Oil! Great product! It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> It us very cool, make the skin soft and oily&lt;br /&gt;Its smell is not bad at all&lt;br /&gt;What I did n&#x27;t like in this product is that it doesn&#x27;t last for a long time. I don&#x27;t know may be because I have dry skin</li>
    <li> i bought this to help with 3rd trimester itchiness and marks that appeared during the 2nd trimester. i can only comment on the smell at this point because using it makes me so nauseous that i can&#x27;t even continue using it. i am surprised no one commented on the smell - it&#x27;s kinda cinnamony and dries to smell like old lady perfume. i can&#x27;t stand it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as for application, it&#x27;s not too greasy, but does take some massaging to absorb. it feels fine after absorption though - you won&#x27;t feel sticky or oily from it.</li>
    <li> i have used a few bottles of this product and ordered it because i seen good reviews on it but after 3 bottles i didnt see no improvement on scars or skin tone just a greasy mess. It does have a smell but its not to bad. No improvement so ill be going back to co co butter :-/</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about this oil but I am 56 years old and it has made a HUGE difference on my skin.  It looks brighter, younger and the fine lines are diminishing for sure!  A friend of mine turned me onto this and she looks great and I had asked her what she was using and it was the Bio-oil.</li>
    <li> I have terrible stretch marks on my tummy and my thigh. I started using bio oil and I had noticed that the appearance of the stretch marks is facing. I haven&#x27;t stopped using it. And again it tones my skin giving my skin a wonderful glow.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! I use it as an all over moisturizer for after I get out of the shower or before I go to bed. It keeps my skin nice and smooth without making it greasy . I haven&#x27;t used it for stretch marks because I&#x27;m not at the baby stage yet but I did have a breast surgery with some tender scarring so I&#x27;ve been using it for that and massaging it in and it&#x27;s been helping. I also use it for after waxing with a little vitamin e oil it works really good to sooth and prevent ingrown hairs. I wouldn&#x27;t use it on your face though because it is an oil and oils can be comedogenic.</li>
    <li> Excelente produto, f&amp;aacute;cil aplicação, percebi diferença j&amp;aacute; na 2ª semana de uso, cheiro muito agradav&amp;eacute;l reconedo a todas as pessoas que querem clarear manchas da pele e cicatrizes.</li>
    <li> Just stick with the 3 month guideline and you will see fading of unsightly stretch marks and remarkable recovery of scars. I hit my tailbone on a faucet and the scar still have not gone away (it didn&#x27;t hurt and wasn&#x27;t very hard.) I got hit in the thigh with my surfboard&#x27;s fin and that HURT and was huge. I put this stuff on it and it&#x27;s completely gone away now, no scarring whatsoever! this stuff works.</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful for men and women makes your skin soft and helps with stretch marks removal and prevention</li>
    <li> I use the oil after my tummy tuck and it light and moisturizer my skin without been greasy. It absorb quickly and give a soft feeling. With everything else with time you will see improvement in skin tone and stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Love this!! Great price great buy! Used this twice daily during my pregnancy, ended up with no stretch marks, not sure if i got lucky or if it was really due to this product. I like the smell too being pregnant all the tummy rubs make me sick  except this one. Definitely worth the money</li>
    <li> Time will tell - right now I am using it and it seems to be good.  I don&#x27;t see any changes in skin yet.</li>
    <li> Great price, even better product. You won&#x27;t find it this cheap anywhere else. Fast shipping and works perfectly, can easily spot the difference from before &amp; after.</li>
    <li> was new and i am not sure if it works or not. having used it for 3 months straight. Thank you for the fast delivery. I will be buying in the future. thanks</li>
    <li> Does wonders for existing stretch marks. Thanks to this product, no new developed after pregnancy!!!</li>
    <li> This oil smoot and make ur feel very good. and price is not so bad. Try it and then you will like it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this everyday, 2x a day since my first trimester and I have no stretch marks. NONE! My belly is beautiful and perfect with no marks or redness. I also use it to take off my makeup, on my face and my husband uses it too. I&#x27;ve bought 2 bottles and I&#x27;m 31 weeks along now.</li>
    <li> After using Bio-Oil for three months, I can see the scars on my hands are disappearing. You just have to be patient and be discipline to apply the oil twice a day. I tried the product on my face, but it is just oily.</li>
