<li> But the quality is very cheap and they are so simple and weak that they don&#x27;t hold tight when used.</li>
<li> She pulls her hair ties out anyways so not a major loss.</li>
<li> These are basically a piece of yarn, absolutely no elasticity to them, will not hold a baby pony tail.  </li>
<li> Total waste.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d almost describe it as compact yarn hair ties.</li>
<li> Not worth $1.00.  </li>
<li> I used it on my 2 yrs old who has really thin hair and they turned into strings.</li>
<li> Not worth 5 dollars!</li>
<li> Can not the same band use twice, poor built and elasticity.</li>
<li> Way less than 92 pcs!</li>
<li> and it becomes long and twisty like a thin thread.</li>
<li> I purchased these hair pieces for my daughter who is just over a year old and had a crazy amount of hair.</li>
<li> not cute color</li>
<li> very poor quality not worth the price at all</li>
<li> These are not good, no elasticity and don&#x27;t stay in my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
<li> The other reviews are fake!</li>
<li> This is a really bad quality ponytails.</li>

    <li> Shipped quickly, tiny size, bright colors and very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> They were cheaply made, didn&#x27;t hold my grand daughters hair, not worth the $$ paid.  Should have known to buy a dependable brand such as Goody. These are basically a piece of yarn, absolutely no elasticity to them, will not hold a baby pony tail.  #lessonlearned</li>
    <li> Cheap and they stretchout</li>
    <li> The picture sold this making it look like if they had a good size. But the quality is very cheap and they are so simple and weak that they don&#x27;t hold tight when used. I would not recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> These are not elastic...just cotton that stretches out so it can&#x27;t be reused.</li>
    <li> I bought them for my Yorkie, these are the first hair ties that my dog actually likes.  They do not bother her at all and I got so many fun colors.  Worth it for sure.</li>
    <li> Not worth 5 dollars! Way less than 92 pcs! To add they&#x27;re only good for one time use! The other reviews are fake!</li>
    <li> They are soft &amp; don&#x27;t pull hair, but they stretch out so much first time using them, I tried to use the same one for a second time &amp; I had to wrap it around my daughters hair prolly 15 times.</li>
    <li> These are tiny and lose their elasticity after one day.</li>
    <li> These are not good, no elasticity and don&#x27;t stay in my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased these hair pieces for my daughter who is just over a year old and had a crazy amount of hair. These are a one use only kind of pony. They have no elasticity in them so they stretch out the second you use them. I&#x27;d almost describe it as compact yarn hair ties. They are super small in the package but when you pull on them they stretch out to almost 3x their original size and never shrink back. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again but for the price I paid they will do. She pulls her hair ties out anyways so not a major loss.</li>
    <li> Got these for my 3 year old daughter. The hair ties stretch out so much after the first use that I had to loop them about 6 times at a minimum to get them tight enough to hold her hair. I ended up throwing them all out. Total waste.</li>
    <li> Not worth $1.00.  Thin and breaks easily.</li>
    <li> Took ages to arrive. Stretch the band once and it becomes long and twisty like a thin thread. Can not the same band use twice, poor built and elasticity.</li>
    <li> These are really cheap and have almost no elasticity.</li>
    <li> nice color, but not able to tight it on hair, feels like no elastic.</li>
    <li> very poor quality not worth the price at all</li>
    <li> This is a really bad quality ponytails. I have used ponytails from dollar shops too and they are much better than these. I used it on my 2 yrs old who has really thin hair and they turned into strings. please see the photo attached.</li>
    <li> not cute color and they stretch too much</li>
