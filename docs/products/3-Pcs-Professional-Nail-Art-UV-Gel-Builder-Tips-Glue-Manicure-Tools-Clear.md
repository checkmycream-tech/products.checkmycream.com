      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten this type multiple times and they work great!</li>
      <li>l Love this.  </li>

      <li>You get free shipping.</li>
      <li>burns nails in UV light.</li>
      <li>so I figured I start with this product and so far so good, applies just like the ones used in nail salons.</li>
      <li>Overall great for the price plenty of product and quick delivery.</li>
      <li>and I started doing my nails myself, price was reasonable and product good in comparison to the professional brands.</li>

      <li>It would be more reasonable to place them individually in plastic bags or plastic wrap when packaging.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t packaged very well though.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>It is easy and lasts a long time for me.  </li>
      <li>Other than that I love it.</li>
      <li>I used a size six brush and found the application took long, I used a size 8 brush and application time is reduced significantly.</li>
      <li>but there are bits of debris in the clear</li>
      <li>Also the clear jar was opened and done product had spilled in the package .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had my nails professionally done</li>
      <li>Pretty big pots prior the price..</li>
      <li>but if its this on  or close to cuticles it does lift the pink look clear but for the price it is actually better than I thought and it dries all product seems kinda thick</li>
      <li>The little issues were: I expected to get 3 containers of clear gel builder, but instead I received clear, pink and white (but that&#x27;s fine).</li>
      <li>I needed clear product but this also included pink and white though it is described as clear.</li>
      <li>Got 3 clears not the clear, pink, and white.</li>
      <li>I received the items one clear one pink and one white even though it was advertised that try were all white.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My clients complain about it burning while curing but it finishes nicely. Its great to practice with. Cosmo/nail students</li>
    <li> I received the items one clear one pink and one white even though it was advertised that try were all white. Also the clear jar was opened and done product had spilled in the package .</li>
    <li> I needed clear product but this also included pink and white though it is described as clear. I can deal with that but there are bits of debris in the clear so I can&#x27;t even use that. 2 stars because I tried to click one and missed.</li>
    <li> when i recieved it they were all leaked out of the package and sticky, couldnt get the smell from my hands for a while</li>
    <li> Love, Amazing, recommend to all buyers. super fast shipping. Product exactly as described. Great price. extremely happy.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t cure in my uv  lamp..  not sure why.  gel polishes cure fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten this type multiple times and they work great! they used to spilll but they have put a plastic peel off lid under the actual lid so that isnt an issue anymore!</li>
    <li> Sitting here right now and db its not getting hard at all ill never buy this product again&lt;br /&gt;Ever ever</li>
    <li> These r legit and works great with my gel extensions</li>
    <li> burns nails in UV light. Other than that I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now and at first it seems as if it just doesn&#x27;t work well.. However with time, and experience this gel is great</li>
    <li> I like these gels because they are cheap and you don&#x27;t want to waste good product on practice hands or fingers I do my nails as well and I use dehydrant and primer but if its this on  or close to cuticles it does lift the pink look clear but for the price it is actually better than I thought and it dries all product seems kinda thick but id rather practice with this than expensive stuff</li>
    <li> Came exactly as shown, works great, great product.</li>
    <li> l Love this.  Wonderful.  I do my own nails.  It is easy and lasts a long time for me.  Great Product.</li>
    <li> This gel works great for my nails. It holds very good for cheap gel. You can buy this gel also on ebay. You can buy a lot of nail art stuff. It is cheaper than Amazon. You get free shipping. I give this 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> Dont like at all, not for me, this is for at home beginners. .....&lt;br /&gt;#nailartist</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it at all, the gel was bad and too hard!!! I will never buy this again, if u want a good one you need to spend more money!!</li>
    <li> I open the package there was tacky from the gel all over the bottles. The bottles were sealed shut so I don&#x27;t know where the gel tacky came from. I just cleaned them up with some rubbing alcohol and it was good. The bottles are full so that is good for me. Thanks.</li>
    <li> The product is pretty good, especially considering it&#x27;s price, and I&#x27;m gonna order it again. The little issues were: I expected to get 3 containers of clear gel builder, but instead I received clear, pink and white (but that&#x27;s fine). Also, it&#x27;s not as shiny as I would expect it to be. But on the whole it&#x27;s really good. Containers are big and gonna last for quite some time. Products came fast and in good condition. I do recommend it for UV gel nails!</li>
    <li> Arrived in time stated. Wasn&#x27;t packaged very well though. I had read that the seal on these cups can break and then the gel leaks out. That is what happened with one of the cups. They&#x27;re not real big, and to have the gel all over two of the cups was not what I was paying for. It would be more reasonable to place them individually in plastic bags or plastic wrap when packaging. Otherwise, I do recommend and hope you enjoy your gel nails!</li>
    <li> Great price!! Got exactly what was described and super fast shipping. Didn&#x27;t have any leakage! Great!! Will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> I will never buy from Sally&#x27;s again! This gel actually lasts, and it&#x27;s 1/3 of the price!&lt;br /&gt;Now my sets last longer! YAY!</li>
    <li> I am just learning how to apply gel so I figured I start with this product and so far so good, applies just like the ones used in nail salons. The only problem was one of the bottles seal shifted so some of the product leaked. There is still plenty of product in the bottle, just was hard to clean up the sticky mess. Overall great for the price plenty of product and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> The consistency  of each jar varies, (pink is thickest)  I used a size six brush and found the application took long, I used a size 8 brush and application time is reduced significantly. It cures well, and tacky layer comes off with Methylated spirit. I&#x27;ve had my nails professionally done and I started doing my nails myself, price was reasonable and product good in comparison to the professional brands.</li>
    <li> I am not too happy with this product. . . I purchased from another company (not Amazon) of this same product.  I followed all the directions, even *cured* it longer than recommended. . .and it still didnt get totally hard. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item is listed as a *Builder Gel*... which I desperately tried to do... however it would not *Build* the nail. . .  I had to soak off the mess at the end of my fingers, add tips so I could try a layover instead. . .  still not to my liking. . . even bought a hardener to attempt to get the gel to harden. . . which did help a little. . .  3 days later I soaked them off too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product would be better used as a gel overlay to polish &amp; designs. . . NOT as a builder gel.</li>
    <li> Pretty big pots prior the price.. Nicely packaged in an envelope... A bit runny but it&#x27;s what you pay for... Don&#x27;t be discouraged thought it&#x27;s still a good buy and came in 10 days early!</li>
    <li> I actually emailed them about my product being spilled out and they told me nothing can be done about it.</li>
    <li> Got 3 clears not the clear, pink, and white.</li>
    <li> i like the gels very much. it hurts when curing it in the uv lamp. thats why 4 stars. seller is amazing to work with.</li>
    <li> It does its job but the lids dont screw on tight enough so it spills out some. not good  f</li>
    <li> 2 containers were opened and got all over the 3 containers. Not worth it.</li>
