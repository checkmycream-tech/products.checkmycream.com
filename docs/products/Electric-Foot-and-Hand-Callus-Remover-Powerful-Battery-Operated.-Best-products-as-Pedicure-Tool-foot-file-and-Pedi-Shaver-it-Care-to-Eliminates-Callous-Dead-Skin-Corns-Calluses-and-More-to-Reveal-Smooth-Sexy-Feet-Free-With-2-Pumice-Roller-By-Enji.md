<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Used only once thus far, but this is definitely worth the price even if it doesn&#x27;t make my feet any better than it already did.</li>
    <li> My feet are very rough as I go barefoot a lot and live in a dry climate. I have used this little gizmo a few times and my feet are definitely getting smoother, however I know I&#x27;m going to have to start keeping my shoes on to enjoy total success. I have read some negative comments in reviews concerning pressing too hard, making the roller stop. I think this is a great feature myself. You could really hurt yourself grinding down too far ad feet are very sensitive. I&#x27;d much rather make several passes than take my hide off. I am happy with my product, and delivery was super fast. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great quality product!&lt;br /&gt;Bought this for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it. I would certainly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why it only has a few reviews, because this is great!</li>
    <li> Hooray I&#x27;m now looking forward to Spring and Summer this year and wearing my open-toed sandals because I now have my very own battery powered Callus Remover. This little tool puts a great pedicure right in the palm of my hand, and it saves me money. I can do  pedicures in the privacy of my own&lt;br /&gt;home, and I never have to worry whether the equipment is properly cleaned. I love the idea that I can put that thought away for good. No risk of infection from unclean pedicure tools. I have the peace of mind knowing I am the only one using it and that ensures my safety.&lt;br /&gt;The unique rollers grind 360 degrees to gently and effectively buff away the dead, callused, hardened and dry skin on your feet. It is quick and efficient; it takes just seconds to get beautiful feet. It comes with 2 different rollers to give you a customized pedicure. No elbow grease&lt;br /&gt;is required because the tool does all the work for you. It has a waterproof design that allows it to run on wet or dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;This pedicure set comes equipped with&lt;br /&gt;all you need to give yourself a first class pedicure without the first class cost. Included in the box is the battery powered Callus Remover tool, a grinding head&lt;br /&gt;and a cleaning brush. The only thing missing is the 2 AA batteries. This is a complete set that will have your feet soft and beautiful in a snap.&lt;br /&gt;You are going to fall in love with this set like I did. It is so easy to use, clean up is a snap, and it is a low maintenance beauty tool. I get my pedicure done in mere minutes. This is perfect for those with arthritis and the like. It is easy on the hands and arms. One of my favorite features is there is no blade that can&lt;br /&gt;cut or knick your skin, like scrapers can.&lt;br /&gt;I only need to use this once a week to maintain soft, supple feet that look dynamite in my strappy sandals.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product to test and evaluate and then render an honest written assessment of. The comments herein are based on my personal observations and experience with this product.</li>
    <li> This is great, men should use it too!  Helps not to ruin socks with ruff callused feet!  You will feel so much better too.</li>
    <li> Works great until the second time I change the battery. The battery cap broken and can&#x27;t put it back anymore!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this little callus remover.  It actually works better than I had expected.  I have used it every day because my callouses were so bad.  I can walk across the carpet now without it catching on my heels.</li>
    <li> I rcvd my Happy Care today and I just used it. I love it my feet feel like heaven</li>
    <li> Great product. My ugly feet with callouses and chapped dry skin on my heels , have been transformed into beautiful feet again!! Thanks so much:)</li>
    <li> I was skeptical and didn&#x27;t think this would do much for my feed. I use a pumice stone quite often on the heels of my feet and didn&#x27;t think this do anything more for me. I was surprised at how well this actually worked. It grinding head on this is like sandpaper and did a great job of removing and smoothing the  calluses on my heals. Left my feet feeling softer and smoother than they have been in a long time. You use this for just 2-3 seconds and repeat if needed.&lt;br /&gt;It was difficult to get the battery installed. I was afraid I would break this trying to pull the battery cover off but it finally came free after a hard pull.&lt;br /&gt;Sample received at a deeply discounted rate for review purposes.</li>
    <li> The item I received came used and did not look like new at all. It was a waste of my money for sure... I was very upset I decided to put in the donation pile I have created to donate this weekend. Very disappointed  ;(</li>
    <li> I was glad to receive an unexpected email with user details from the manufacturer/owner.  The product indeed perform as expected.  It took me several sessions to get the resutls I wanted, but my feet feel and look better. it couldn&#x27;t be easier to use, and I am happy to stop spending $$$ at the nail salon for spa pedicures that don&#x27;t last more than a few days. This gizmo costs less than half of a single session with a nail technician, and will surely last a long time.  Thanks, ENJI!</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I expected and it works very well. The batteries are a little tricky to get in the first time but after that there have been no problems. It arrived in the time I expected and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the customer service.</li>
    <li> I bought one and it didnt work so I returned it and they sent me a new one. Tried it today and my feet feel alot smoother. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Their is no worse feeling than felling tough skin on my feet. I am so happy I finally got this great product. I feel more comfortable wearing sandles. I feel better about myself thanks to this callus machine. I recommend it. It doesn&#x27;t hurt and works great. This review was based on my honest opinion. Get it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> It really does the job and so easy to use</li>
    <li> This works, but is very slow.  After trying multiple times and both damp and dry feet, I have gone back to using the Dr Schols callous paddle.  Works so much better with not to much effort</li>
    <li> I like this callus remover, but it appeared to have been used prior to me getting it. Parts that shouldn&#x27;t have been attached, were attached and it was dirty as if it was used and then returned.</li>
    <li> This product works ok, just not as good as I expected based on the advertisement.&lt;br /&gt;The product is not very sturdy - I can&#x27;t press down much to get more traction, I am afraid it will break.&lt;br /&gt;I did not see it was battery-operated, or I would not have bought it because I dislike things that use batteries.&lt;br /&gt;I have an old Brookstone callus remover which is better than this one, and it uses a wall plug, much better for cost and for sturdiness.</li>
    <li> Sooo mine doesn&#x27;t stay on during use when I turn it to different angles it shuts off, then as soon as I turn it upright it starts working again!  Its almost as if something on the inside of this thing isnt properly connected! I have been able to use it once and I can&#x27;t complain but I also can&#x27;t get excited because it&#x27;s not what I expected. Since its completely unsanitary to send this back (BECAUSE I&#x27;M SURE IT WILL BE RESOLD TO SOMEONE ELSE ) I&#x27;m not going to nor will I request a refund. I&#x27;m going to just count this as a loss. BTW is it just mine or is this thing hard as hell to turn on?!</li>
    <li> I love this callus remover.  It is very gentle.  I have thick calluses because I go bear foot all the time.  I used it for a few minutes each day after my morning shower (after drying my feet, but before they are dried out).  By the end of the first week, my feet were beautiful and that is easy to maintain, even though I still go bare foot.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It is what it says it is, it works.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job smoothing the edges of my heels.</li>
    <li> This product really works great.  My heels were in horrible shape and this gadget has made a big difference in me wearing sandals now.  Would recommend, but you need to use this at least 2-3 times a week to get the full effect and use cream after you use it.  I cannot live without this gadget.  Great!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this and it really smoothed out the rough spots on my feet. It is easy to use and is just liked it is described.</li>
    <li> Try it , you will like it. It has really made a difference on my feet.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think it had enough power.  The company is reliable and I had no problem returning it for a full refund.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions to the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; in regards to installing the battery.  I put the device back in it&#x27;s box and laid it on the counter in the bathroom to use at a later date and when I went to retrieve it out of the box to use about a week later (I live alone), the bottom of it fell off in my hands.  There was no way to put it back on and have it stay so it is unfixable.  The quality of the construction of this product is very cheep.  I am VERY disappointed that I didn&#x27;t even get to test it out to see if I liked it.  Don&#x27;t buy this product!  Update: 8/5/15  I was sent a new replacement unit and find it works fine.  It works as advertised, as it gently sands away rough skin and makes your heel and ankle very smooth.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these, one for my daughter and one for me. We both love it and only wish we would have bought it sooner.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of the price and good reviews. We didn&#x27;t get a chance to try it because it arrived broken. It is tiny piece of plastic that holds the battery lock in place.  So fragile it apparently can&#x27;t survive shipping or putting the batteries in.  I received and email from Enji shortly after ordering with this exact line in it --&amp;#34;Have a look at the photo attached how to install the batteries please! And when you twist the bottom part back to closed position, you have to be careful and make sure the Mark &amp;#34;OPEN&amp;#34; is on the front, otherwise bottom will broke off!&amp;#34;--  A product that can&#x27;t survive inserting the batteries is pretty ridiculous.  Also, I have received 5 emails form them so far trying to get me to leave a positive review.  Hopefully my spending the time to write this review will save someone else some time, don&#x27;t buy it.  I should have provided a photo, but I already sent it back.</li>
    <li> Their is no worse feeling than felling tough skin on my feet. I am so happy I finally got this great product. I feel more comfortable wearing sandles. I feel better about myself thanks to this callus machine. I recommend it. It doesn&#x27;t hurt and works great. This review was based on my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work !</li>
    <li> Product is as advertised; works fine.</li>
    <li> Got it for my niece, she loves it and said it works great.</li>
    <li> not as forceful as even the Dr.Leonard&#x27;s cheapo ones I&#x27;ve owned in past--works &amp;#34;just okay&amp;#34; if you have already-smooth feet, but really doesalmost nothing as per tougher callusses--I&#x27;ll continue to keep searching</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more powerful then expected and it did the job, I just wish it had a less rough or a lower powered mode to use on elbows or the side of toes without rubbing skin right off! It does say only use on the feet and I just had to try it on a callus on the toe from a pair of shoes I wear a lot and it did remove the callus.... right along with some skin! Not terrible but like a small rug burn. However, like I said the package did warn me! For the bottom of the feet... awesome</li>
    <li> Quick delivery! This product is amazing! It does exactly true to its description. With one use, I saw a significant difference and my feet were soft again. I am completely satisfied with my purchase. God bless.</li>
    <li> returned slow as molasses.</li>
    <li> I have been using a pumice stone for about a year with poor results.  After just one use with the ENJI Happy Care Callus Remover, my heels and the sides of my big toes are softer and smoother that they have ever been.  I think this product is wonderfu.</li>
    <li> Finally got my very own callus remover.. I suggest soaking your feet first using the item to get a better result.. I used it dry and soft, (Dry feet) didn&#x27;t get as much dead skin compare to when you soak it.. It does works great and will give you a perfectly soft feet in just minutes.. No need to spend a lot of money going to salon anymore :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received to test and try out to give feedback on the quality. This review is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> This is a cool product. It works great at removing callus from my heals. Also handy for sanding annoying metal burrs for example from aluminum sliding door.</li>
    <li> Only so - so.  Have to hold with extremely mild pressure to prevent roller from stopping.  Takes tons of patience to work heels.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I was skeptical that it would be powerful enough to really do anything with the calluses and cracked skin on my heels. What a surprise.  I expect to use this for a long, long time and my feet are looking better with each use.</li>
    <li> When I tried to open the battery compartment the bottom came off, and I couldn&#x27;t get it back on. What&#x27;s worse is that the item had tiny bits of hair on the roller and in the white casing. After reading other reviews, I&#x27;m thinking that I&#x27;m not the only one to receive a used one. This is tackier than hell. The return practices need to change. So does the design of the battery compartment. One star for potential. I purchased an Amope Pedi Perfect instead that I will also review. So far, fantastic.</li>
    <li> Does a great job for the price.  The only thing better would be an electric, non battery type.  It would probably maintain it&#x27;s power longer but,  the price made this the best choice for me.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time. These reviews are fake. Not worth the time and effort.</li>
    <li> Shipping was great. Product though is not very powerful. Soon as you touch it to your skin it slows down. Without much pressure at all it pretty much stops rotating. Can do better and faster manually.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work very well.  If you don&#x27;t apply pressure, it doesn&#x27;t do anything.  If you do, it slows down.  I tried all combinations to see if there was a pressure/speed that would be effective.  Nothing worked.  Can I return it for a refund?</li>
    <li> Love it...very gentle and effective.  Took great care of my &#x27;winterized&#x27; toes and heels.  I wear 3&amp;#34; heels daily...they are now ready for 3&amp;#34; sandals!  I Used longer than recommended with no irritation. Works well on finger calloused too.</li>
    <li> Not too strong, but works if you use it often and let your feet soak first.</li>
    <li> I love it ,it work feel great thank you. I finally found it a product that really work</li>
    <li> Not happy at all. Defective</li>
    <li> Terrible power and not good for sensitive skin...</li>
    <li> I have rough feet from taekwondo and this made them so soft just after one use! I would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Oh my. This is an incredible contraption. I am such a weirdo about my feet in the summer time, because I live in flip flops and barefeet. But recently, I&#x27;ve noticed the calluses around my heels are becoming rough and cracked! Gross. And then when dirt gets into the cracks, my feet look and feel extremely dirty and rough. I never thought that I&#x27;d become someone with weird rough feet - but as a mom of 3, my needs naturally seem to fall at the absolute end of the line. So there I am - in church - with my favorite fancy sandals and HIDEOUS heels. All that to say, this electric food and hand callus remover has become one of my most prized possessions. I am able to remove whatever callus that gets between me and my vanity. :) It&#x27;s very easy to operate and understand, as the instructions are very clearly explained. It&#x27;s comfortable to hold as it seems to fit right into  my hand. It is light weight and does not need to be used with force or strong muscles. It simply runs along the callus and it is gone. With most things such as this, it is highly recommended not to share with others, for hygiene reasons. But I wouldn&#x27;t want to share anyways. It&#x27;s my miracle maker. And saves me money from going to the get pedicures...!! And time, as the pumice stones never seem to take care of all the calluses. This would make a most excellent gift to your fellow foot person or hard worker, (calluses on hand). I am so glad that I was able to review this product in exchange for my review. It has been a life changer and has helped my level of shame, disappear. :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this  Callus remover on 7/31 and on 8/3 right after 6 a.m. it was in my hands.  Love the product, easy to work, gentle, clear directions and does the job!  I have very dry skin and my heels are the worst.  This is the solution for me.  Co. also offers the replacement rolls and I will not hesitate . I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this.  I am tough to please and I am pleased plus!  My heels are getting happier as the days go by!</li>
    <li> the product seemed already used, or at least a bit handled... so far do not know how the action it, so cannot really give a thorough answer...</li>
    <li> It works good. I&#x27;m pleased with it</li>
    <li> I received this item to test and provide my honest feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was skeptical on how well this product would work on my &amp;#34;hobbit feet,&amp;#34; but I just used it for the first time and I&#x27;m surprised. When I was not trying to laugh (ticklish on my feet), I could feel it grinding away (not painful). I compared the right foot (first to use device on) with my left foot (untouched by this device) and could definitely tell the difference because the right foot felt smooth to the touch while the left felt rough. When both foot were treated with the callus remover device, I can rub my feet together effortless as they just glide.</li>
    <li> Noisy but does the job...callouses gone!!  Service was excellent.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:dc495ef353decd99c705d7867abdfe7e]] I hope everyone enjoys my amazing review! :)</li>
    <li> I purchased the callus remover for my wife and so far we both are very happy with the results and happy we choice we made. Thank you</li>
    <li> I would love to give this product 5 stars however the item I received was defective (did not work with the batteries) and the bottom piece fell clean off right out of the box. The products is being returned for a refund. I will say that it rollers seem to be textured enough to get the job done. Only wish I was able to use it.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use and my feet are nice and smooth!</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t get te piece off to put the batteries in-HELP</li>
    <li> I can only give this a 4 star rather than a 5 star; it&#x27;s an &#x27;okay&#x27; product, not a GREAT product. If the callus remover roller were coarser, it would probably be more effective, but, since it&#x27;s not.....takes longer to achieve the desired goal. That may be a good suggestion for them to offer a tougher, more rugged roller for us &#x27;guys&#x27;!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  It works well and removes calluses easily.  The price is great-a lot less than I would expect to pay for a quality item.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product!easy to use and operate!</li>
    <li> my feet were extremely callused, the ENJI did a teriffic job. just not sure how long the plastic gears will last.</li>
    <li> I really liked this, but then it totally stopped working even with new batteries.  Unfortunately it is beyond the Amazon return period so I will see if I can get a refund or replacement from the company.</li>
    <li> It works great but the only problem is getting the batteries in the bottom where you open it is very hard to pull off</li>
    <li> This did a good job of smoothing my feet.  You can&#x27;t press on it hard, because it stops working, but you don&#x27;t have to apply much pressure for it to work.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend the CR-10.</li>
    <li> Would make a great Christmas gift !</li>
    <li> This product is a five star rating. I really liked how smooth my feet are now. It can be used wet or dry. I added the batteries and off I went to awesome feet again. Now I am ready for flip flops. The grinding rollers were easy to use. It buffs away callus and hard skin in seconds.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised at how well this callus remover done. I have really bad calluses on the heels of my feet. I have used this quit a few times and love it. It works perfectly. It has made my feet look so much better. I don&#x27;t have all that white flakey skin on my heels anymore. The more I used it the more it helps. Sample received for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> First one was defective. Parts missing.  Second one came 2 days later.  Works as described, motor a little weak. It is what it is.  Company response was outstanding , for replacement. Although they never sen\t a pick up slip or notice what to do with the broken one.    Daboss</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:6cda3b1d31013cf256acd0535b84a161]] I really like this :  ) Im not s fan of going to get a pedicure all the time but I like to upkeep my feet &amp; keep them soft so I thought Id try these out. This one is really good. You dont have to push hard to get it to work like. Im adding a short video with it running so you can hear the motor &amp; what it sounds like during use &amp; to show oyu how much skin it did take off after only rubbing for a few seconds.</li>
    <li> Works great and has more power than similar products.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the callus remover.  My feet were very rough, especially the heels which the remover smoothed.  I really didn&#x27;t expect it to work so well, but I am very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Worked well both wet and dry. Easy to clean. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Works great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok product, but that&#x27;s all. I&#x27;m almost sure I received a product that had been used by another customer. It was dirty and the box looked used. This is disgusting. It does a decent job, but my skin is quite soft, and I don&#x27;t think it works for people with thicker skin.</li>
    <li> does not work.it does pay to even to return it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this device about 9 times so far.  I have extremely bad calluses on my feet.  Frequently I am embarrassed while getting my pedicures thinking the salon people are speaking in Vietnamese about my terrible feet.  Ha. Well, this gizmo is fantastic.  After nine treatments my calluses are almost gone .  My feet look great.  Do not press hard, just hold the tool gently against the area and let it spin and rub off the callus.  I love it and will recommend to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Got the product quickly.  The first time I put batteries in it the bottom broke off as I was putting the bottom back on.  When the batteries go dead, this item will be worthless as I can&#x27;t get the bottom off to change them, without tearing it up.  I will have to throw it away and chalk it up to wasted money and getting what you pay for.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works fine. But this item is for lightly-calloused feet. My golem stompers hardly felt abrased by it.</li>
    <li> Oh, Finally a solution for my calluses!</li>
    <li> I am in Love with this callus remover. I was very skepital at first since iv had a few of these before from another brand and it was a waste of money. But i got lucky this time it left my feet smooth in no time light and perfect water proof and amazing i am so happy.</li>
    <li> This is excellent.  It operates exactly as described.  Can&#x27;t go wrong.  Plus, quick reply from customer service.</li>
    <li> Makes your feet feel softer. I will  continue to use this  product.</li>
    <li> Not powerful enough, definitely not heavy duty, and has to be used daily.  You&#x27;ll get better results with the Ped Egg.</li>
