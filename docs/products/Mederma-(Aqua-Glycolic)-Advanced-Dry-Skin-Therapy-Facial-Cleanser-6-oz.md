<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t clear up my acne and it doesn&#x27;t remove makeup well.  However, I like it because it is a gentle cleanser that also helps clear up scarring.  My face feels good after washing with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Side note: I tried so many things to clear up my acne without going to the dermatologist.  He told me that topical washes/creams really aren&#x27;t very effective at hormonal acne around my jaw line, on my neck, chin, and back...not the kind I got as a youth.  The meds he gave me have worked so great!  Don&#x27;t waste too much time and money before seeing the doctor like I did.)</li>
    <li> This is a superior glycolic facial cleanser.  It beats any other that I&#x27;ve tried, including the ones that are &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; and expensive.  All of the Aqua Glycolic products are all excellent.</li>
    <li> My face hasn&#x27;t been this clear of acne since I was ten years old.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used various AHA / glycolic acid formulations over the years, including a line carried exclusively in dermatologists office and some high end french stuff.  At twice the price, this stuff would still be a great deal.  The strength is just what I was looking for.  My skin is looking great after daily use for about 6 months, without any irritation or peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who might not be aware, you put this product on when your face is dry.  I usually put it on a few minutes before I am about to get into the shower and then massage gently and rinse once I am in.  Works great!  I will definitely continue to use this product in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small quibble is that the first time I ordered this product the cap came off in the mail and glycolic acid leaked all over everything in the box.  Of course, Amazon sent out a replacement the same day, this one packaged more securely, but you might not want to order at the same time as other items, just in case.</li>
    <li> It helped clear up an acne problem that my other soap ccouldn&#x27;t do. I also follow washing with witch hazel and rosemary oil mixture which works best. I find it to be a bit drying in the winter with heat in the house. Using the hazel/oil mix helps with that.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help with skin barnacles.</li>
    <li> Breaking out during pregnancy has been a big problem and you are limited to what you can use.  Alpha Hydroxy (glycolic Acid) is something that you can use and it keeps my acne under control!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my dermatologist. It is really a nice face wash. I used to be able to. Find it in the drug store but they stopped carrying it. Then I ordered from the pharmaceutical company and was thrilled to see it on amazon.it seems to really clean your skin but doesn&#x27;t dry it out.My husband started using it also and really likes it.</li>
    <li> I love this facial cleanser.  Been using it for years.  And this is the cheapest place to buy it.  Recommend</li>
    <li> I have bought this from my pharmacy, however it was less expensive here.  Exfolates very well!</li>
    <li> Could be a coincidence but when I started using this, i broke out like crazy. I&#x27;ve never really had break outs before so I attributed it to stress from finals. Long after finals were over, I was still getting new break outs so I stopped using this. About 8 weeks after I had stopped using this, I was still breaking out so I ended up going to the dermatologist and got a antibiotic and retinol prescription. I feel like this spurred the non stop break outs but like it said, could just be a coincidence. Needless to say, I&#x27;m not using it anymore.</li>
    <li> So far, I really like this product. I&#x27;ve been using a face wash that was recommended to me by my dermatologist about 7 years ago that was 10% glycolic acid and 2% salicylic acid. It was just too harsh on my face and after all those years just started working less and less. I just got this Aqua cleanser about a week ago, and I use it once a day at night and so far I have liked it. Though my skin does get some breakouts, it takes makes the scarring less lasting and the breakouts have a shorter life. Though it&#x27;s only been a week, I am seeing results and hope they continue.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product a few weeks ago and have been using it everyday since. It has not helped in clearing up my acne. I have adult acne and I have struggled with acne my whole life. I have tried everything from Proactive, Accutane (which helped immensely during my teenage years), drugstore brands from Clearasil, Cetaphil, Clean &amp; Clear, Neutrogena, and many others. The only face wash that has seemed to helped clear up my acne and prevent my face from flare ups was Panoxyl 4% benzoyl peroxide creamy face wash. I tried switching to this product because Panoxyl does not work for me very well anymore due to my face getting used to the benzoyl peroxide. I used this product in conjunction with their face cream, which did not help much at all. I have been using both of these products together 2X per day with no results. I recently had a flare up of acne all over my face which is very disappointing. I am not sure if I will continue using this product because I do not want it to make my acne worse. I will continue to search for something that will work for me...I was really hoping that this one was it.</li>
    <li> I use this to wash my face in the morning and I use neutrogena oil free acne cleanser (orange one) at night to get all my makeup off.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about 5 or 6 years now and it&#x27;s still amazing! I usually get it from the pharmacy at Kaiser (not with a prescription-- they just sell it there), but since I moved away for school, it&#x27;s easier to order from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom uses this also and swears by it. The glycerin in it sloughs off all the dead skin cells and allows the cells to turnover faster and regenerate -- which is why my mom looks so young! My mom is a pharmacist at Kaiser and got all her coworkers to start using it too.&lt;br /&gt;I have been making my boyfriend use this also since he has that white boy skin that ages poorly lol.</li>
    <li> 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very good product</li>
    <li> I have use this for years and love it! It make your face so soft.</li>
    <li> My &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; cleanser!  I have mother nature&#x27;s &amp;#34;cruel joke&amp;#34; kind of skin--Mild to moderate acne, sensitive skin, thats now facing mid 30s aging issues. Hello wrinkles and hyperpigmentation.  This cleanser is great. Gentle, effective!  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t quite clean my face as expected.</li>
    <li> I rally love this cleanser tingles from retinol does a great</li>
    <li> I bought this product to combat some acne, and it did absolutely nothing. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it</li>
    <li> My daily facial cleanser, gently exfoliates away makeup, dead skin cells and leaves my skin bright, cleansed and ready for my nighttime creams. The subscribe and save price is unbeatable. Cell turnover is key to healthy glowing skin and a anti-aging regimen is a healthy habit to have. I am almost 40, but my skin does not show my age. I used to be an Esthetician, and have used expensive products all of my adult life. I have been buying this product for years now through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Best facial cleanser and recommended by my dermatologist.  Transaction was flawless and delivery quick</li>
    <li> used it for years and still love it.</li>
    <li> Ordered for our daughter at the advice of our dermatologist. Product works exactly as described and her skin results were exactly as she was told they would be. Works great and priced affordably.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I&#x27;m well past my teens and twenties but still have imperfect skin.  This was recommended by a dermatologist a long time ago and never used it as regularly as I should until the past few years.  But it really seems to make a difference in keeping my skin in good shape and mostly free of breakouts (and if there&#x27;s an occasional breakout it&#x27;s not as bad as before).  Would definitely recommend to try out and use daily!</li>
    <li> Best skin cleanser.  My skin is so clear now. I love it. This is a excellent facial skin care product. I going to use it and replace all my  other face cleaners.</li>
    <li> I want to like this but it has parabens.</li>
    <li> Really excellent results</li>
    <li> I love love this cleaner I have been using this brand and glycolic for over 20 yrs. It works better than any other I have tried.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin and have tried all kinds of &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; soaps to no avail.  Aqua Glycolic cleans my face and is kind to my skin. I have not been able to find it in any stores so must resort to online ordering (bothersome but not troublesome)&lt;br /&gt;TWS in SC</li>
    <li> Easy to use, worked fine; but no better than other cleansers I&#x27;ve used.  Since it&#x27;s pretty expensive, it&#x27;s not a good value for me and I likely won&#x27;t reorder.  I bought this with the cream for rough spots I&#x27;ve developed on my face as I&#x27;ve gotten older.  My dermatologist recommended it, but the rough spots are still there although slightly reduced.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. My Dermatologist recommended it!</li>
    <li> My skin tends to be very oily and this is one of the few products that makes my skin feel clean. I feel like my pores are smaller when I use this cleanser. It&#x27;s non-irritating and does a nice job overall.</li>
    <li> I started using this because it was recommended by skinacea.com and it definitely helped reduce my break outs. It didn&#x27;t make it 100% clear but not sure if any single product can do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an Asian male with oily acne-prone skin. I no longer use this because I decided to start taking Minocycline and using Tretinoin Cream (finally went to the dermatologist). That has cleared my acne 100%. Once my insurance expires and I run out of Tretinoin, I will probably start using this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This facial cleanser isn&#x27;t a miracle cure but for me it&#x27;s worked better than Benzoyl Peroxide, Salicylic Acid, Aztec Clay, Apple Cider Vinegar, Sulfur Ointment, Aloe Vera Gel, and Egg Whites. When I did use it, I used it every night. I applied it on dry skin, left it on for several seconds, then washed it off.</li>
    <li> I use this as my shave gel in the shower and it&#x27;s wonderful!  I also use it on my upper arms as a leave-in lotion over night (maybe twice a week) to help control dry skin and clogged follicles.  This is a gentle cleanser and leaves my skin soft.</li>
    <li> I originally found this product at a local close out store about a year ago, and purchased it for my 35 year old husband. He&#x27;s struggled with cystic acne since he was a teen, and has tried everything--prescription medications, creams, washes, herbal therapies, ProActiv, home remedies--you name it, he&#x27;s tried it.&lt;br /&gt;For years, he used a high dose of topical Benzoyl Peroxide cream to keep the acne in check, but because one&#x27;s skin becomes &amp;#34;addicted&amp;#34; to BP, in a sense, any time he discontinued or decreased the amount used, his acne flared with a vengeance. Not to mention the fact that BP bleached everything it comes in contact with--hello faded shirts, sheets, and towels!&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased this product, he was initially skeptical, but gave it a shot anyway. He was a little taken aback by the fact that you massage a tiny bit (dime sized) of this non-foaming wash onto your DRY face, and then add a bit of water, massage again, rinse with the warmest water you can tolerate, and pat dry. This routine was a bit more time consuming, but he did it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Within two or three weeks, he noted an amazing difference in his skin tone, texture, and reduction of cystic acne, whiteheads, and blackheads. He has since drastically reduced the amount of BP he uses (YAY! no more white sheets!) and his face has remained almost totally clear, sans the occasional pimple or two.&lt;br /&gt;After over 20 years of struggling with severe acne, he feels as though this has been his miracle breakthrough. He only wishes he&#x27;d found it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;With 2x daily washing, a bottle lasts approximately 4-6 weeks. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wish we had the option to purchase a larger sized bottle since we have to order it rather than purchasing it in store somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend purchasing this product, and giving it a try for at least a month. As with most products, you might experience some redness, dryness, or even an increase in breakouts initially as your skin adjusts to the new regimen-DON&#x27;T GIVE UP! Give it a few weeks, use it on dry skin, and see what you think!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product from my dermatologist and love it for shaving sensitive areas! Close shave without irritation! The best product. I have tried for shaving!</li>
    <li> Delivery was ahead of time so that was a nice surprise.  Good cleanser and not drying to the skin.</li>
    <li> I can not say enough how much I love this. Been using for about a month and it is the only thing that works on breakouts. I&#x27;m over 30 with breakouts and this is really the only thing that cleared my skin. I feel like I tried everything. I use the auto-send so I do not run out. I researched and read all the reviews before purchasing and this lived up like nothing else. I love.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 months. I like using the Aqua Glycolic Cleanser because it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face especially where there is acne. It feels like my makeup goes on smoother. I wash my face after I&#x27;m done taking a bath because I leave on the cleanser for a couple of minutes (just because). I notice that if I don&#x27;t wash my face every day(because I&#x27;m lazy) my face starts to B/O 1 or 2 pimples. I also use the cream from Aqua Glycolic ( I like that too).  Hope to order their toner too. I also take vitamins for my hormonal acne and try to eat better (still a working progress).</li>
    <li> Last long, cleaning well, strong but not damaging.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist reccommended it and combined with topical ointment, I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results. Especially like that it doesn&#x27;t bleach fabric and it doesn&#x27;t sting, burn or dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> This product works well for my dry and aged skin. I am showing results in the first two weeksof use.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT IN THE PAST AND IT WAS FINE. I DON&#x27;T KNOW IF THE FORMULA WAS CHANGED, BUT NOW I CANNOT USE IT BECAUSE IT DRYS MY SKIN OUT.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years now and find it to be a great cleanser and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> good product does not dry my skin out</li>
    <li> Caused me to have clogged pores!! I prefer the Thomas Roth glycol acid wash!</li>
    <li> I have been using this on recommendation from my dermatologist for many years now and it helped clear up my adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;It works for me.</li>
    <li> Great shipping. Product itself is good, nothing to complain about. Follow the directions to use on the label. Feels clean skin after using.</li>
    <li> Use with aquaglycolic toner! And moisturizer if you want but not essential. This is awesome from smooth clear skin and pores-- EXFOILIATOR</li>
    <li> Instead of shaving cream, I have been using Aqua Glycolic each morning for years.  I highly reccomend it.  I don&#x27;t want to use anything else.  Jim Lott</li>
    <li> I have crazy combination skin and it was acting the fool for a few weeks. I knew I needed to change cleansers and my esthetician had recommended that I use a glycolic cleanser with my type of skin. So I hit the Amazon reviews and found this gem. I had never heard of the brand before but it was reasonably priced and the Internet said good things. And the Internet was right! I see a significant difference since I started using this product. My skin is soft, I&#x27;m not breaking out as much, and my moisturizer sets right in after use. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my Dermatologist.  Great product.  Reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Gentle on my skin, yet very effective.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this facial cleanser almost 20 years ago. I have used it twice a day all these years on my rosacea prone, sun damaged, sensitive skin. It is the absolute best treatment to shrink pores, fade sun spots, and reduce wrinkles. My skin looks much younger than my years, I never have break outs, and always get comments that my skin &amp;#34;glows.&amp;#34; Why spend more--this product WORKS.</li>
    <li> gentle seems to leave a film I don&#x27;t care for...would not re-purchase.</li>
    <li> I recently picked this item up on Amazon after suffering my first breakout since I was a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;A dermatologist had recommended it to me back then, and I was happy to find it still exists.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is clear and happy again, and I like how smooth it makes it feel. I use it on my arms and other areas as well in the shower and it works nicely all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to wear sunscreen, especially when using this product - it makes your skin more susceptible to burning.</li>
    <li> Great price, the only reason I did not give it a 5 is because it does not lather.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this facial cleanser.  I keep rebuying it because I can&#x27;t be without it.  After just one use, my skin is so much softer.  After a few days, it was much clearer and brighter. This company is great!</li>
    <li> I first started using Aqua Glycolic on the recommendation from my dermatologist and that was over 20 years ago. People tell me I look 15 years younger than my real age. Love it.</li>
    <li> great product for the money!</li>
    <li> This feels like Cetaphil but didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling clean. I feel like I need to wash it with something else after.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for almost 10 years now and I still love it.  I like that it isn&#x27;t drying, but is still good for my combination oily/dry skin.  A little goes a long way and I only need two bottles to last me a year.  Unlike any other cleaner I&#x27;ve ever used, I put it on my face dry and rub it in first.  Then I rinse with water.  If your face is wet before you apply it doesn&#x27;t rub into the skin and get you clean.</li>
    <li> Been using this for 18yrs. My skin is always complimented. Acne and pimples used to upset me in my youth but this cleanser and a light sunblock has saved me years of frustration and money!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, acne prone, rosacea type skin. This cleanser did not produce any novel breakouts or redness! No dryness. It is well formulated. I can tell that it helps as a chemical exfoliant because it leaves my face smooth and more bright. Nothing fantastic to really mention, though. It did not help clear acne for me as some people may say it does. It is just a good chemical exfoliant.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this for long; it seems to work pretty well. The review is for the formulation, not the effectiveness. Minus two stars for it containing parabens. I wish they could replace them with something safer.</li>
    <li> Very nice exfoliating cleanser.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Two of the worse parabens - returned</li>
    <li> Works great and minimizes pore.  Has helped tremendously with acne problems. Can&#x27;t be without it.  K.W.</li>
    <li> Awesome facial Cleanser.  Recommended by a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Face just didn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; after using.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say I actually notice a change in my skin, but it goes on well, feels gentle and  effectively cleans.</li>
    <li> A dermatologist recommended this and I have been using it for over a year and love it.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 3 years. It&#x27;s an excellent product and it makes my skin very soft and smooth. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> One of the best facial cleansers I have used.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Like the feel of this. It cleans but doesn&#x27; make skin dry.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THE CLEANSER FOR YEARS, LIKE THE WAY IT MAKES MY SKIN FEEL, SEEMS TO MAKE THE WRINKLES LESS</li>
    <li> Have used other glycolic products. My skinfeels nice. Not dry and tight.</li>
    <li> Three stars because it doesn&#x27;t break me out… But it also doesn&#x27;t get all the make up off</li>
    <li> I used to use MD Forte III but switched to this because their price went up from ~25 to ~35. I like the Aqua Glycolic just as much and it is much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have hardly had this two weeks and my skin is clear! Also I live in a really dry area and it does not over dry my skin. I am a little lazy about washing my face and have seen these results from just once a day use. I am 41 and my skin is oily and acne prone, especially around my period, so I have dealt with these issues for years. Adding this to my regime has made a huge difference. I could keep my skin relatively clear with good practices, but this even reduces blackheads and hormonal acne and has the added bonus of erasing blemishes and acne scars very fast! I plan to continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I posted almost the same review for other Aqua Glycolic products, because they deserve it...Great AHA product and cleanser.  I started by using it once a day, and now use it twice.  I use it along with the Aqua Glycolic toner (also twice a day), and occasionally use the Aqua Glycolic cream on the rare painful pimple.  I also have sensitive facial skin (I break out in eczema with salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide), but haven&#x27;t had a reaction to any of Aqua Glycolic&#x27;s products, and they&#x27;ve helped to keep my mild to moderate acne in check.  I also use Retin-A to treat my acne, and using these high concentration AHA products at the same time has saved me from the unsightly peeling that many who use Retin-A complain about (especially in the first few months of Retin-A).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. the Aqua Glycolic shampoo/body wash has also helped exfoliate my occasionally dry and dandruffy scalp...yes, I&#x27;m a Aqua Glycolic fan, but they&#x27;ve earned it.</li>
    <li> Its ok only used it 2x ummm I have to wash my face 2 or 3 times to get any makeup residue off and this doesn&#x27;t lather its very gentle</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting. I have extremely oily skin and am in my mid 40s. I have had cystic acne and oily skin all my life. I was hoping this would have more glycolic acid. Because this doesn&#x27;t foam it doesn&#x27;t seem to cut the oil on my face. I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in blemishes, blackheads, whiteheads etc. Some glycolic acid products can be strong enough to slough the dead skin cells off. I was hoping it would do that. Didn&#x27;t happen for me. G</li>
    <li> Deep cleans without any irritation.  It&#x27;s a great face wash</li>
    <li> After using other products I&#x27;m back using this product again.  My face feels really clean although it can be a bit drying.</li>
    <li> it was recommended  by my dermatologist, I&#x27;ve used it for years.  i love it</li>
    <li> Lots of harmful chemicals in this ie: &amp;#34;sodium laureth sulfate&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great product and shipped fast!</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my face feel afterwards. i occasionally used this, or cetaphil facial cleanser, and my acne has improved. After using one of these cleansers, i use Stridex Strength Medicated Pads; followed Elta MD Skin care intense moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, shipping was fine on the way to Edmonton, Alberta Canada. I am satisified with my purchase, and i recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product for my teenage son.  Great price.</li>
    <li> This is some good stuff! A friend recommended it to me. Has really helped with break outs!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 50 years old, with very sensitive skin, and adult acne. (Really? Acne at my age?) It&#x27;s mostly on my nose and jaw lines, but just for fun I&#x27;ll get some anywhere on my face. I don&#x27;t get it on my shoulder or back, so I was pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t related to any of my hair care products. It was just Mother Nature&#x27;s way of saying &amp;#34;50 isn&#x27;t old. You&#x27;re still a teenager at heart.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Aqua Glycolic Facial Cleanser and started using it daily. (I only use it once a day, though you can work up to using it twice a day). Even though my skin is very sensitive, I haven&#x27;t had any stinging with this. And that kind of disappointed me. Almost everything I use on my face makes it sting! That&#x27;s how I know it&#x27;s working, right? So, I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks. And yeah, at first all the acne bumps that I could feel under my skin started to come to the surface. But today, my skin is clear, and there are no lurking bumps waiting to come up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a little more expensive than I would like, but it&#x27;s so totally worth it for me! Clear skin at last!</li>
    <li> I have been using a glycolic cleanser for over 6 months.  My skin is noticeably more smooth &amp; I rarely wear foundation now.  I have been using this particular brand of wash for two weeks &amp; I really like it.  I do not have acne (occasional pimple), but I have an oily t-zone &amp; I want something to keep my pores cleaned &amp; my skin smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems to have a fairly high glycolic acid content because it worked faster than another glycolic cleanser I was using.  Glycolic Acid is the second ingredient listed.  The texture is strange &amp; it doesn&#x27;t foam up like normal cleansers.  I follow the directions on the bottle which is to apply to dry skin, smooth in &amp; then get it wet.  I use a facial cleansing brush to gently work it in &amp; exfoliate.  I try to let this sit on my skin for at least 3 minutes before rinsing.  I use it once a day.  It only takes a dime-size dollop to wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, if my skin is having a small breakout, I will use this at the same time with my favorite salicylic cleanser which is made by Neutrogena.  They work well in combination.  I follow my cleansing with argan oil every time.  I wear argan oil 24/7; it is the best moisturizer I have found that doesn&#x27;t clog pores or make my skin feel greasy.  Not all argan oils are created equal - there are some really junky/fakes out there so beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be too strong for some skin.  The other cleanser I have been using is more gentle &amp; probably has less glycolic acid.  I recommend it if this one does not work for you.

    <li> seems to be working for me,i like it so far</li>
    <li> My daughter recommended this product and I will be using it from now on.  My skin has never looked this good.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist has taught me to read the ingredients on what I put on my face. The key to having good skin is to avoid stressing it and not treating it like a dirty oily pan but rather a delicate flower. None of this cleansers ingredients are stressful or comodogenic or cause hyper sensitivity to my sensitive combination skin! The best time to use an exfoliating cleanser is in the morning when you wake up. I slough off the dead skin cells from last night from sleep to reveal new skin with this gentle aha cleanser!</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite glycolic acid cleanser. It improves  overall skin tone and texture.  It helps to decrease the # of breakouts I have. I  would give this product 10 stars if I could ;) I am a long time user of this product. And the cost is a bargain!!!&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution: if this is your first time to use a glycolic acid cleanser, use this one sparingly, and start out using it only a few x&#x27;s per week, and gradually work up to using every day.</li>
    <li> my Dermatologist recommends this wash for acne skin. i love it its clearing my skin up very quickly and not drying my face out</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it for years :)</li>
    <li> Typically, I buy the DDF version of Glycolic wash but wanted to try this due to the reviews. Honestly, it&#x27;s a good product. Leaving it on damp skin for 2-3 minutes does the trick. I saw the brightening effect after the first time and it really helps with exfoliating the dead skin cells efficiently. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my dermatologist. It took me a while to get used to not having any suds, as well as massaging it in BEFORE you wet your face but it&#x27;s ok. Its not drying and that&#x27;s a great thing because my face gets extra dry in the winter.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase. Not only do you get a cleanser that works great but it is a full size product just like they show. This is now the only cleanser I will use.</li>
