<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 of these in 2 years.  While they work fine for brushing teeth, drop them once and they&#x27;re useless.  The motor breaks, and Oral B will not warranty a dropped product. Tell me, how many people&#x27;s kids have dropped toothbrushes before??? It&#x27;s ridiculous that Oral B does not warranty the motor better than that.  What good is a warranty then???</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with electric tooth brushes in the past.  I would say it was my fault for thinking that a $10 electric tooth brush would do the job.  You get what you pay for and anything less than $40 will just make noise while you brush.  I asked my dentist what she would recommend and this was it.  I put it off for months thinking if I should really spend a lot of money on this.  Then I started thinking that my oral health is at hand.  I brush twice daily but brushing, like shaving is annoying, but it has to been done.  Problem, is that I wasn&#x27;t brushing and flossing well enough.    Once I bought the Oral-B 9400, it literally changed my life.  I enjoy brushing and the results can be seen fast.  It really cleans well as if you were brushing and flossing in one shot. I also find it fun knowing that I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t brushed long enough if I don&#x27;t see the Happy face on the LCD screen so I keep on brushing.    My only complaint is that once at full charge, it can be pretty fast and strong.  I sometimes think if it could cause a cut or canker sore.  Also, when water gets into the brush head, it makes this sound like something is clogged.  Either way, minor complaints.  In short:    It charges fast  The battery lasts a long time  Very sleek looking  Excellent cleaning results  Teaches you to take your time  Fun to brush</li>
    <li> The toothbrush works great and is a great value if you consider the overall cost and comparison to other electric toothbrushes. I love the auto-timer as well as the pressure sensor. I recommend this item!</li>
    <li> great toothbrush but miss the time on it, the old one you could see the time on it so you knew how long you were brushing for . now it just beeps several times when you have done 2 minutes.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9000 performs worse than less expensive Oral-B models. It claims to prevent you from brushing too hard...it doesn&#x27;t. Brush harder and it continues to run as it normally would.  Also, compared to the Oral-B 3d Excel (which is replaced by the Model 1000 so I&#x27;ve read), the 9000 is heavier due to the display and larger battery, and it vibrates slower for a less vigorous cleaning. I much prefer the 3d Excel because it performs and cleans better.  You may not want or need all the extra features in the 9000. The large button is the power on/off button, and the small triangular button changes the cleaning mode from Clean(Normal) to Soft to Massage to Sensitive and back.  While you&#x27;re cleaning, the brush does a noticeable jiggle in your hand every 30 seconds and then does a long triple jiggle at the 2 minute mark to indicate that you have reached the recommended amount of cleaning.  If you can remember all that or don&#x27;t need 4 different cleaning modes, then you may want to opt for a lighter, better, less expensive Oral-B model without the display and with fewer cleaning modes.</li>
    <li> I previously had a Sonicare Inteliclean which was horrible.  In addition to it being just a bad brush the Sonicare customer service was a joke.  So I said \\&quot;never again\\&quot; and I went to the competitor.  Boy am I glad!  This is a great brush. Compact, light, and powerful.  And the brushes cost a lot less than the Sonicare models. I am super satisfied.</li>
    <li> I own the old 155XX series brush that was given to me about 6 years ago as a gift and have been using it until now. I just bought this new one since it&#x27;s a new type of brush head. I must say that I like this one much better. For one thing, it&#x27;s much quieter and faster at the same time. The larger brush body allowed them to put in a more powerful motor. It almost feels like they&#x27;ve incorporated the Sonic motor into this unit. The new brush head seems to work better at getting the plaque off also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the extra heft of the larger handle. I didn&#x27;t really need the LCD display either. Many of the function could have been given by the way that the handle shakes or beeps to signal for different modes. That would have allowed them to remove the unnecessary display and reduce the weight a little. Instead of the the display, a simple single green/yellow/red LED would have been just as effective at letting us know if it needs to be recharged. Anyway, that would have been a smarter design.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush I have ever used or purchased.  I only have used the clean cycle thus far and haven&#x27;t tried the polishing tool that comes with it. &lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s an excellent product and far better than a normal toothbrush.  It has significantly strengthened my gums.  My teeth look and feel cleaner.  Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Really I have tried many electrical toothbrushes, but Oral B 9400 is the best. Thank you very much</li>
    <li> I had the Oral-B circular only brush before, and the Sonicare before that.  This is the first one I don&#x27;t feel the need to do brushing at the same time.  It really does the job just pressing down on each tooth (with a little up and down motion).  It REALLY gets the job done. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The thirty second timer is useful, the 2 minute timer is useless, since the timer reset each time you power down, even for a second (to spit).  The 4 flat rubber things actually work, I have watched them in the mirror, and they do brush well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun electric toothbrushes for years &amp; the new Oral-B Truimph is the best.  While the variable speeds are useful, the cleaning speed does the best job ever.  When I use a pre-brushing rinse, my teeth feel as clean as when I leave a dentist.</li>
    <li> This is a great product -&lt;br /&gt; I am using Braun electric toothbrushes since over 30 years - I am always happy with them - but the 9000 series beats everything!</li>
    <li> Our Sonicare finally died after 4 years.  It has a nice long track record so  we were taking a chance when we decided to replace it with the Triumph.  We  loved it so much that we bought them as gifts for our family.  The small head is great for hard to reach back teeth.  It is also great for small children.  We use the extra soft head on the soft settings for our 21-month son.  One minute of brushing with this toothbrush is as good as 2 minutes with the manual one.  Sometimes he brushes his own teeth because he likes the techy-gadget toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I bought this Oral-B Triumph for myself and have been so pleased with the results.  I have been a long-time electric toothbrush user, but this one surpasses any brand I have previously used in producing that feel of clean, polished teeth (and I haven&#x27;t even used the polishing brush yet).  My gums feel stimulated and healthy, too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My Mother and adult son have peridontal disease, so I purchased an Oral-B Triumph for each of them as a gift.  It has not been long enough to judge any effect, but I am hopeful they will see improvement in gum health.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The ability to choose a softer brushing has been a good option for me as I have one tender spot on my gum where I put it into use.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift to my daughter who was thrilled to receive the Oral-B Triumph Toothbrush. I just might have to get one for myself!</li>
    <li> My teeth are now really clean and the gums get a good workout. I think my dentist will be happy, especially with the back sides of the teeth which the hygenist usually has to really pick at during the cleanings. My only problem is that the button which changes the speed/mode of the brush is easily pressed accidentally while brushing. To make sure I don&#x27;t press it, I have to consciously move my hand farther down on the handle than I would naturally grab it. But that&#x27;s not really a big problem.</li>
    <li> I purchased it for my Mother for Christmas and she really likes it, says the size is great for her hands and does a great job cleaning.</li>
    <li> I had replaced my old oral-b with this new one. its almost a year since i bot this. This is awesome. happy with its performance no cons for this product so far.</li>
    <li> I have had this Tooth Brush for 2 weeks now. I had previously used a Sonicare Inteliclean 8500. The Oral B in mind definitely cleans better than the Sonicare 8500. I can see it and I can feel it.  The Sonicare Inteliclean uses a Crest tooth paste cartridge which is sort of neat but it makes it a lot more bulky and you have only one choice for a toothpaste.  I have been using electric tooth brushes for a long time and the Oral B Triumph is the best I have ever used. Cannot go wrong here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the most thorough or articulated tooth brusher. I admit. But after this thing, i have no choice, before work, before sleep, i love it. It works well and makes easy usage for those new to electric brushes like i was. Very pleasently surprised.     Cleanliness is no longer an issue. I can see myself going to the dentist next time and having him say, \\&quot;What are you doing here\\&quot;. I can literally see the difference.     Not too many people have mentioned this, but you do have to buy the polish heads seperate. That was sorta unexpected. Especially at this price range. But three heads which will last a whole year are $16. so i can&#x27;t complaing. Very good system thus far.</li>
    <li> THIS LITTLE MACHINE DELIVERS EXACTLY AS PROMISED.WE USE ORTHO ATTACHMENTS THAT GLIDE EASILY AROUND AND UNDER WIRES AND BANDS ATTACHED TO STANDARD BRACES.THIS TOOTHBRUSH GETS AND KEEPS FOOD OUT FROM UNDER BRACKETS AND IN HARD TO REACH AREAS.AND THE BEST PART IS WHEN THESE BRACES COME OFF SOON,THE OTHER ATTACHMENTS THAT ORAL B OFFERS ARE JUST AS AWESOME!!WE ALREADY HAVE THE FLOSSING AND THE POLISHER HEADS THAT KEEP THAT SMILE LOOKING JUST LIKE YOU&#x27;VE COME FROM A DENTIST APPT EVERYDAY.TRY IT,YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED:))!!</li>
    <li> Best electric toothbrush. Extra accesories not neccesary. Has perfect design, and levels for brushing. Comes with travel case, and no problem left on charger. Base charger has convenient close down lid. Sorry, can&#x27;t get better than this one!</li>
    <li> We are very happy with our new electric toothbrush.  It really gets in there and cleans our teeth.  The timer is a big help.  Have been using this over a month and very happy with our selection.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift 1.5 yrs ago, and I must say...it is arguably one of the best gifts ever! I went from brushing (&amp; hating it) and my teeth having tons of rough \\&quot;funk\\&quot; on them all the time...to using the Oral-B Triumph power toothbrush and having both clean feeling teeth and enjoying the brushing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Cleans teeth extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;-Enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;-LCD screen with charge indicator, timer, &amp; smiley face when you reach two minutes to provide a sense of accomplishment.&lt;br /&gt;-Changes in brush motion ever 30 secs help you keep track of time elapsed.&lt;br /&gt;-Brushheads do last a long time, several months each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Loud, but I suppose this cannot be helped.&lt;br /&gt;-Included plastic travel case has flimsy retaining mechanisms that break easily.&lt;br /&gt;-Brushheads cost alot compared to a standard toothbrush...but hey...it&#x27;s worth it completely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not regret a purchase of this or another power toothbrush. It&#x27;s a true necessity that will enable you to enjoy brushing and keep from putting it off.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have found that the Oral-B Triumph is great.  After using the toothbrush it feels like you have just come from having your teeth cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s office.  Especially like the extra features including the polishing feature.</li>
    <li> Just like any other Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush, it is easy and enjoyable to use. I bought the 8400 because I needed the travel charger, which is indeed small and convenient when traveling with the brush. The \\&quot;special\\&quot; brushing modes are not very useful to me, and I guess most people would simply use the regular brushing mode (which seems similar to the one in the cheaper models). The digital screen does not make a big difference as it doesn&#x27;t give you an indication of how much time you have left.</li>
    <li> I got this when it was over $100.  I will say it is worth it.  I&#x27;ve had several Oral-B&#x27;s before, one for the road and one battery-powered (7000, I think), for home. While this does little more than brush your teeth, I like that it is rechargeable, as trying to get batteries inserted into my old brush is a nightmare (requires three hands, or maybe pliers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really got me to like this toothbrush is that it let you know when you have spent long enough time on each quadrant. It gave me an incentive to brush my teeth at least twice a day, as I knew that I spent long enough time everywhere. It was a bit confusing to figure out how this worked, thought. It has a timer that counts down (or up, I forget, never have to look any more), and I expected it to beep, which it didn&#x27;t. It sort of halts its rhythm for a couple of beats, and that is the cue to move to another part of the mouth. At first I thought it was that I was pushing to hard against my teeth, but that was not it, as I soon found out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a nice curve that makes it easier to reach to the back of the mouth, and it sits well in the hand.  I am not sure it is worth the money, but I am still glad I have mine.</li>
    <li> My hygenist recommended this product when my old Braun toothbrush died.  I was shocked by the price but thrilled with the product.  My teeth feel slippery clean and my gums are happy.  Amazon had the best price on toothbrush the flossing replacment heads.  It&#x27;s worth the $$$.</li>
    <li> My face is shaped like Joni Mitchell&#x27;s: Prominent cheekbones and large teeth. It&#x27;s really tight in there, and I guess I have been brushing my gums into thier own little resession! Since I have used the Triumph my teeth still feel smooth and clean as they did after my hygienist visit. As for the claim that it gets between your teeth, well, that depends on how crowded together the teeth are. The brush head is a little big to fit between my cheek and gums, so I have to pull my cheek out to give it room. It&#x27;s also kind of spattery, especially when you are doing the backs of your front teeth. I guess I am still getting used to using it, but guess what...I actually look forward to brushing my teeth! It signals you to move every 30 seconds to a different area, but I am never finished in time because of the contortions I have to go through to get it to fit in my mouth. But it makes my mouth feel so clean that I hate to eat anything between meals- so maybe it doubles as a weight loss aid!!</li>
    <li> Although it costs more and I don&#x27;t think most people would need the extra features on it, the oral-b triumph is a dandy brush. I like the angled head, the three speeds, and the charge life display. Storage base looks nice by the sink and is quite functional. Easy to separate the charger from the base to take with you for traveling. Floss brush head works well and feels good on the teeth.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush for my husband. He absolutely loves it. Since we purchased this toothbrush his dentists visits are going a lot better.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended the Oral-B 9400, and I&#x27;ve put it though its oral hygiene paces the last year. It&#x27;s more expensive than many other models with similar features, but the similarity extends only so far.  We&#x27;ve seen a proliferation of electric toothbrushes at $25 and under, and one might wonder why more you get for your money here. I&#x27;ll go over the highlights below, but suffice it to say that the 9400 works very well but is overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Power. First, any rechargeable toothbrush is going to cost significantly more--somewhere in the $40-$50 range. If that&#x27;s an important feature, you&#x27;re already heading towards the Oral-B cost.  Where this toothbrush really shines (no pun intended, I think) is its POWER. When fully charged, this baby&#x27;s rotation leaves others far behind.  While not as fast as a dentist&#x27;s drill-toothbrush (and, really, I&#x27;m sorry to bring up that word), it resembles it more than others.  The power enables the Braun to brush without slowing, even as you manually move it against your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Motion. Personally, I don&#x27;t notice any action other than the rotation. I Trust that there&#x27;s 3-D oscillation, but I don&#x27;t feel it (maybe that&#x27;s good). I&#x27;m also skeptical about their claim to a \\&quot;floss-like clean.\\&quot;  Use floss instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features/Gimmicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Speed. There are three speeds; I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever used anything but the fastest, but perhaps those with some initial sensitivity would appreciate the medium speed.  I don&#x27;t know why one would use the slowest speed.&lt;br /&gt;2. Timing.  The toothbrush is programmed to conceptualize brushing as a two minute endeavor, 30 seconds per each quadrant of your mouth (i.e., top left and right, bottom left and right).  Accordingly the brush pauses briefly every 30 seconds, letting you know you&#x27;ve done your time, and then it&#x27;s all ahead full for the next quadrant. At two minutes, there&#x27;s a longer, easily perceived paused, at which point you can stop (and look at the electric face beaming at you from the handle) or keep going without having to turn it back on. I actually like the timer: Two minutes sometimes is longer than what my mind tells me, and I also spend as much time on the last section I brush as the first.&lt;br /&gt;3. Ease of use. This is a substantial electric toothbrush, but as long as you don&#x27;t have muscle issues in your hand or wrist, that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.  It&#x27;s quite maneuverable and it has an excellent reach.  The charge lasts two weeks or more, and I recharge overnight.&lt;br /&gt;4. Toothbrush Bristles. The toothbrush head contains an assortment of bristles, both softer and stiffer, and varying in length and angle. Supposedly these armaments help you tackle various oral scenarios such as food stuck between the teeth, massaging gum lines, reaching distal areas.  Again, I don&#x27;t think these are any substitute for flossing, but they do seem better than a conventional brush.  The heads last around 3-4 months or so, and replacements are available, although at a absurdly high price. I;m still not sure how I&#x27;m supposed to know it&#x27;s time for a new head, however.&lt;br /&gt;5. Noise. In normal use, the Braun is medium loud, you probably won&#x27;t disturb anyone if you keep the door closed, but you may if you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;At times, either toothpaste residue or a loose head seens to cause a high rattling sound; this just requires some cleaning or tightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost:  This model has just zoomed up in price aat Amazon.com since I bought it. I suggest you shop around and see what else is available (either this model at other stores, or other models), and whether the \\&quot;extras\\&quot; here are really worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One person&#x27;s gimmick is another&#x27;s brushing motivation, so it&#x27;s a personal decision--although also one that should be made in consult with one&#x27;s dentist. Overall, a powerful, effective, reliable, but costly toothbrush.going without having to turn it back on.

    <li> I purchased this to replace my older Braun (don&#x27;t remember the model, it was $30 at Target).  I was worried that the only thing I was getting for the extra money was the digital readout, but I could not have been more wrong.  The Triumph is truly an advanced toothbrush, and closely mimics the motorized brush that the dentist uses for cleaning/polishing.    As for the price ($66), Amazon was ~$40 less than local retail (Target, Walmart, etc).    Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> Upgraded from my old Vitality to the 9400 because I got a deal on it. I&#x27;m not sure if it vibrates faster because it&#x27;s brand new, but it seems faster than my old one ever was, and my teeth were noticeably cleaner feeling after using it, with the same sensitive head from my old brush. Feels a little more comfortable in the hand because it&#x27;s a little larger in diameter. Another plus is there&#x27;s less rubber in the handle though it&#x27;s not slippery at all, making it less likely to smell as funky at the base as the previous models. The base is harder to clean because you need to disassemble it to thoroughly clean it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this toothbrush.  (1) I like the way it feels on my teeth; this encourages me to USE it.  (2) The 30 second timer is great.  Rather than doing quadrants, like a dentist does, I do front back bottom, front back top; it seems so much easier to keep going for thirty seconds instead of two minutes, even though the end result is the same.  (3) I don&#x27;t know if other electric toothbrushes have a travel case but this one does, I took it on a short trip without bothering with the charger and it was super.  Thumbs up!    My dentist recommended Peroxyl to go with, and I like it a lot too.  Perfect combination.  [[ASIN:B000052YD1 Colgate Peroxyl, Antiseptic Oral Cleanser (Hydrogen Peroxide), 8 fl oz]]</li>
    <li> I believe this is the best electric toothbrush I have owned. As a three to four times a day brusher, I have owned a number of different electric brushes. This sturdy well engineered machine is dependable and thorough.</li>
    <li> I would have rated this toothbrush higher were it not for several deficiencies in design. In general it is a nice looking device, very stylish, if you&#x27;re into that. It is also very easy to clean, not like the competition Philips Sonicare device, which is terrible to keep clean. The Oral B&#x27;s brush heads are cheaper too. It seems to brush adequately, but not better than Sonicare in my estimation. The Oral B&#x27;s control buttons are far too easy to hit while brushing, changing its mode, even turning it off. As far as the modes are concerned, I find that only one, the default one, is really necessary. Finally, the brush head is not provided with a cover or shield as is Sonicare&#x60;s.</li>
    <li> My teeth get so clean with this toothbrush!  I do not mind the vibrations at the 30-second intervals.  It keeps me on track with how long I&#x27;ve been brushing.  Also, I find myself looking at the handle in the mirror to see if I have earned the smiley face yet (after 2 minutes of brushing).  I love this toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Like many others, I absolutely adore this toothbrush.  I ordered it based on a review my cousin gave on it.  It leaves my teeth feeling clean and smooth...all day.  I&#x27;ve never used any type of electric toothbrush, but was told by my Dentist that I should, so I made the investment.  I brush my teeth in quarters. I like that this one beeps as an indicator to move onto the next quarter.  Who knew it should take 2 minutes to brush your teeth ? I also like the three speeds it offers. At first, I was a bit sloppy with the brush, but after two weeks, I have mastered it, and look forward to brushing. I highly recommend this toothbrush to anyone wanting a clean, smooth feel in their mouth all day..</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, in my opinion. Here are some of my notes:    1. I have used my Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush for about a year without any problems.   2. The toothbrush digitally indicates when it needs charging.   3. The charge is relatively long-lasting. (I have noticed that my battery indicator will blink when it is low and will continue to blink once plugged in although it is charging at this point).   4. The base station has a small footprint, with a place to store the toothbrush heads.   5. The portable charger takes up little space, and is especially useful for travel.   6. The toothbrush indicates a smiley face at the end of your two-minute clean.   7. It will also show a toothbrush head when it is time to change to a new head.   8. The toothbrush promotes two-minute cleans, 30 seconds for each quarter of the mouth. The toothbrush pulses and indicates a change when it&#x27;s time to switch position in the mouth.    I have no problems at my dentist visits, and I know that I am doing a great job with this toothbrush. I now use this toothbrush with the Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet for an exceptional clean.</li>
    <li> This product was delivered promptly. It works well and I like all the features. It is helpful to be able to change the brushing modes. In my case I set it to gentle mode.[[ASIN:B000A7W5DI Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush]]</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product that Braun has created. It is much much better than Sonicare. Oral-B brush comes with floss-action brush heads which are round and effective. After cleaning every day and night in few days I saw a difference.    My teeth now shines like the way dentist clean. It has white polish and power-tip brushheads which are useful add-ons.     The look and feel of Oral-B 9400 is much better than comparable Sonicare.  I would highly reommend this product.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is great.  The only thing I&#x27;d change is to move the mode selection button.  I sometimes bump it while brushing.  That and I&#x27;d leave off the gentle mode completely.  It seems worthless to me.  Once you&#x27;ve gotten used to this, a regular brush just doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing anything anymore.</li>
    <li> The Oral B Triumph 400 tooth brush is better than I expected. Great for cleaning teeth and my gums are stronger.</li>
    <li> Fabulous. Powerful and fast. Easy setup and use. Much better that the early models of the Oral-B/Braun. A sure road to clean and happy teeth!</li>
    <li> Using this brush made my teeth very sensitive. I figure it erodes the enamel. As you know tooth enamel once lost does not rebuild. I stopped using the toothbrush around a year back, but my teeth are still sensitive. I regret ever buying this brush. In fact I am not going to buy a electric toothbrush ever. Manual brushes are the best.</li>
    <li> My wife asked me to purchase this Power Toothbrush for her after her Dentist recommended it.  She has enjoyed using it and is very pleased with its performance.  She liked it so much, I purchased a Oral-B Power toothbrush for myself.  They are really fantastic.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this brand of toothbrush. I don&#x27;t think I will ever use another toothbrush. I can&#x27;t believe how well it cleans your teeth.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT IS OUTSTANDING!  PRODUCT ORDERED WAS NOT LONGER.  VENDOR SEND THE UPGRADED VERSON  FOR THE SAME PRICE.  WONDERFUL VENDOR.  I WOULD USE  HIM AGAIN, HAPPILY!</li>
    <li> What a toothbrush!  Honestly, it really is awesome!  It feels like a dentist visit every morning and night, and sometimes in between :)  The strength of this brush is just amazing.  It is a strong, forceful (but not harsh) clean.  I love the option of the 2 minute timer.  It also has a \\&quot;professional timer\\&quot; which is also a 2 minute timer, but pulsates every 30 seconds to change quadrants of your mouth, to endure that you get the best possible clean.   &lt;br /&gt;It comes with a 30 day money back guarantee, so you have nothing to lose!  You won&#x27;t believe the feeling and the look of your teeth after only a few days of using this brush!  &lt;br /&gt;I love the Flossing head brushes!  They are great!</li>
    <li> I have both the Sonicare Elite and the Triumph.  Both do an excellent job of cleaning your teeth.  The Sonicare has more side to side action while the Triumph has a more circular motion.  The Sonicare beeps at you to move every thirty seconds, the Triump makes a motor sound prompting the same action.  Both have excellent grips and its easy to change the brushes. And both have good battery life, though I&#x27;d give a small edge to the Triumph. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I really like my Triumph because it holds its charge well and the brush motion feels more like what the dental hygenist uses.  Some reviews comment that the brush is too noisey -- give me a break.  Both the Sonicare and the Triump make noise appropriate to the task at hand. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The best part of these two brushes is that they make you brush for two minutes. The Sonicare asks you to get a new brush every 6 months, the Triumph every 3 months.  Replacement heads for the Triumph are less expensive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you asked me which brush I&#x27;d grab for a trip, my preference would be the Triumph, But, if I grabbed the Sonicare by mistake, all would be well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Either one does a great job.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I upgraded to the Triumph from the Oral-B 8850 DLX and I am so glad that I did - this toothbrush is awesome and would recommend it to anyone considering it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I like the feature where it knows which brushhead you are using and it automatically goes to that brush mode.</li>
    <li> This was a purchase recommended by my hygienist.  It&#x27;s easy to use and my teeth have never felt so clean!  This is a fantastic toothbrush.</li>
    <li> The best product I invested in. Will reduce my trips to the Dentist. Outstanding. Delivered to to me with in three days.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift and it was well received.  In fact, the person I purchased it for is already requesting replacement brushes to have in stock.  The service was great and the item came quickly and in good condition.  Definitely, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Using this toothbrush makes teeth feel like they have just been cleaned by the dentist. Best electric toothbush ever.</li>
    <li> I own this product for about one and half. I am loving it till the charger won&#x27;t charge anymore recently. I dug through the product website, spend $23.00 to purchased another charger. I hope it can last longer this time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this 9400 Power Toothbrush for almost two years now and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. It really does scrub your teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the most impressive aspect is, I haven&#x27;t had my teeth cleaned in three years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But each time I visit the dentist (for a major dental procedure I&#x27;m currently enduring), he tells me, \\&quot;You&#x27;re teeth and gums are in excellent shape. I don&#x27;t say this very often but you really don&#x27;t need to have your teeth cleaned.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 48-years-old and prior to purchasing this toothbrush, prior dentists would tell me that I wasn&#x27;t doing a very good job of cleaning my teeth. This Oral-B has made toothbrushing a simple and easy affair. I no longer dread scrubbing away at my teeth (as I once did).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds a charge for 10-14 days and is easy to use. I highly recommend this toothbrush, especially for 40-somethings who are hoping to hold onto all their teeth!</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush! I would not return to a regular brush. I\\&quot;m someone whose dentist cancels my cleaning appoinments, because my teeth didn&#x27;t need cleaning by a professional. Imagine that my teeth feel so much cleaner now with the oral B power toothbrush. But you&#x27;ve got to floss!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product last year. I still have the same toothbrush and am very pleased with the Oral B Triumph. I use to use a traditional toothbrush and on occasion if I am really in a hurry I still will, but I use this product every day and I especially like the toothbrush heads that have the plastic gum massagers on them. I went to the store to buy replacement heads and I think this toothbrush must be a popular item because it seems like the stores run out of these replacement heads and have all the others in stock. I purchase just a brush replacement head and was not as impressed with it. So stock up on your refills when you find them. You can always find them online also. When I was shopping around for this product Amazon came through again and I got the best price through them.</li>
    <li> I have been using the same Sonicare Elite toothbrush for the last 6 years. I loved it! However, in the last few months I have noticed that my teeth haven&#x27;t felt as clean and my last dentist cleaning took a little longer. My dentist recommended the Oral B Triumph. I was ready for a change and went ahead and purchased one. So here is my comparison between the two. The Triumph feels much larger in the mouth, the neck of the actual brush is wider. The handle is also much larger and a little uncomfortable to hold in comparison to the Elite. However, I really like the Triumph brush head because I feel like I have more control and can get in tighter places with it- I feel like the backs of my front teeth are cleaner then they ever have been. The Triumph is a lot louder then the Elite. I do feel like the Triumph is a little more \\&quot;rough and tough\\&quot; and does a better job at cleaning. They are both good products but I am happy with my Triumph purchase and I recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothbrush considering all of the features:    1. smart design with a timer  2. 41000 pulses a minute  3. uses a long lasting nimh battery, replaceable  4. floss action brushes    Overall, great product for keeping your teeth healthy and pearly white.</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush on the advice of my dentist.  It seems I was brushing too hard with the manual toothbrush.  The interesting thing is that with this new toothbrush, I had to start with the \\&quot;feather\\&quot; mode, as regular made my gums bleed.  However, once I got used to it, I really like it; it makes my teeth feel super clean. I would recommend it to anyone who wanted a good power toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Great power toothbrush! I only wish it came with a few more brush heads, otherwise I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Takes some getting used to after only using a manual brush, but I do enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I previously used a Sonicare Elite for several years, on the advice of my dentist. It was wearing out so I wanted to try something new.  The reviews for the Oral-B were very good so I bought it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I should have realized the Oral-B was a rotating motor type toothbrush, and I was used to the tiny sonic pulses from the Sonicare.  BIG DIFFERENCE. With the Oral-B, I felt like my mouth was being drilled upon, and my whole head vibrated. The brush head was very large and cumbersome for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up going to a local store and buying the Sonicare Flexcare, which is not the cheapest one out there, but returned to the sonic pulses and extremely clean feeling after brushing teeth.  No head vibrations! Smaller brush head with softer bristles, good for sensitive teeth or gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In defense of the Oral-B, the toothbrush did clean my teeth well.  I just didn&#x27;t like the jarring motion compared to the Sonicare.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric toothbrushes ever since the first Sonicare toothbrush came out when they were just selling them in infomercials. I have used the original Sonicare and the 2 models that came out after that and then I went to the [[ASIN:B0002M50Z6 Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrush]] toothbrush which I liked better than the Sonicare brushes. I used the first one until the battery died after about 2 years and I got another one and used it for about 2 years and I was completely happy with it. That is because I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing. I had seen the great reviews on this toothbrush so I thought I would just try it out. I am glad I did. This is not a Sonic type toothbrush which I knew before I bought it so I was kind of skeptical but all my concerns were put to rest the first time I used it. It gives you the fresh feeling you have when you leave the dentist. My teeth are smooth and much cleaner than they ever were when using the sonic type of brush. Combine this toothbrush with [[ASIN:B001JJDUBM Crest Weekly Clean Intensive Cleaning Toothpaste - 0.85 Oz]] and you can practically skip going to the dentist for your biannual cleanings. Well you can go just so you can hear the dental assistance tell you how clean your teeth are. So to sum my review up, this toothbrush is AWESOME! Get it! you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I started using this brush about a week ago and am already noticing some results.  It&#x27;s easier to get the hard to reach areas (such as wisdom teeth) and cleans better behind the teeth.  If you&#x27;re pressing too hard, the brush will stop spinning until you apply less pressure.    One major thing I&#x27;m noticing is that my gums are beginning to fill in the tiny spaces between my teeth again.  I used to think my gums were perfectly normal, but I can now that they weren&#x27;t and that their health is being restored.  It&#x27;s a good feeling.</li>
    <li> I use a 5 year old oral-b product.  My girlfriend however was using the standard toothbrush.  I eventually bought the 9400 for her and she loves it.  The first time she used it she said, \\&quot;my teeth feel so much cleaner.\\&quot;  Other then as a gift, I don&#x27;t have any user experience with the 9400.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and love it!  I used Sonicare products for many, many years and because of constant breakage, poor customer support and sensitive teeth, I decided to change.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t make the change much sooner.  Awesome product!  Great on sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> I finally had to replace my old Oral-B electric brush, since it gave up the ghost. I would have given this toothbrush 4.5 stars if allowed, but my complaint is relatively minor, so I gave it 5.  So - here&#x27;s what I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The way it cleans - hence the smile&lt;br /&gt;2. The variable speed feature&lt;br /&gt;3. The &#x27;quadrant&#x27; timer - although the old brush told me when I was done, this one tells me when it is time to move from the front to back (or top to bottom, depending on your style).&lt;br /&gt;4. The battery gauge - much like a cell phone, it shows the level of charge. I can rev it up, then unplug until the gauge shows one bar (usually about 5 days, using it twice a day).&lt;br /&gt;5. The travel charge ring and case. This is one of my favorites. I used to travel without my electric because it was too bulky to take the whole stand. With the nifty removable charge ring (and the universal plug) and carrying case, I can easily take it anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;6. The heads from my old brush fit the new one. Couldn&#x27;t believe someone actually designed an update that used parts from the older version! I&#x27;d just bought a new pack of heads when the old one died and was sure I&#x27;d just thrown away good money.  A big &#x27;atta boy&#x27; to Braun for this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t care about:&lt;br /&gt;1. The smiley face when you&#x27;re done and have brushed long enough. Cute but extraneous.&lt;br /&gt;2. I think the display face also provides other information (besides battery level and smiley face), but when brushing, one can&#x27;t see it, so who cares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;The size of the handle.  It doesn&#x27;t fit my smallish, female hand as well as the old one.  I&#x27;ve learned to manage, but it just isn&#x27;t totally comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, it&#x27;s a great brush and I&#x27;m 99% happy with it. So go ahead and get one - and brush happy!</li>
    <li> Oral-B Triumph System is nothing less than incredible.  Having to deal with the vendor was a nightmare..... to the point that my wife is strongly against buying anything via Amazon.  Surely this is not your fault but that won&#x27;t change her feelings after dealing with this vendor.  The product (Oral-B) is more than they advertise - it is simply GREAT!</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush.  Replaced an older Oral B and this is superior.  Great battery life.  Comes with a nice travel case and allows you to go about a week without a charge.    Only downside is that the replacement brush heads tend to be pricey.  The good thing is they are available locally - saw some at a Walmart recently.    Highly recommended.    Only downside is that it came with only ONE brush head - so if multiple members of the household are going to use it then add the replacement heads to your order.    Price I got on Amazon was best onthe web and also received free shipping.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush&#x27;s performance is flawless! Even in the short time I&#x27;ve owned mine, I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference in how clean my teeth feel. Brushing doesn&#x27;t feel as much like a chore using this toothbrush as it did with a manual toothbrush. Overall, it&#x27;s an excellent, high quality, superior performance toothbrush and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best electric toothbrush we&#x27;ve come accross.  We give them to our ortho patients as part of their treatment and also highly recommend them to all our other patients.  The storage parts are dishwasher safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how clean it makes my teeth feel and it makes my gums feel fantastic!  It stutters to tell you its time to move to the next quadrant and when your 2 minutes are up, you get a happy face on the display for brushing!</li>
    <li> I purchased this Oral B Triumph Professional Care 9400 because my old Oral-B electric brush just went out of commission after more than 10 years.  In the product description, they said that Triumph would stop if you applied too much pressure.  But that didn&#x27;t seem to be so.  What really happened is the 30 seconds timer.  Whenever the timer expires, the brush just paused a few seconds before resuming the operation.  This action signals the time that the user should switch to a different quadrant.  I used to spend about 10 minutes to brush my teeth.  The timer helps to keep me in check so that I wouldn&#x27;t over brushing my teeth too much even though I often go over the limit of two minutes.  I like the floss action brush head that comes with the order.  It made my teeth feel exceptionally clean the first time I used it.  I also used the Oral-B extra soft brush head to avoid damaging my gum.  The three brushing modes are not necessary.  The cleaning mode is the one you need most.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush really cleans your teeth. The regular setting is a bit too intense, so I use the \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; setting (there&#x27;s also a \\&quot;polish\\&quot; setting, but I don&#x27;t really see how it makes your teeth shinier). It also comes with an awesome carrying case for traveling.</li>
    <li> This is truly a massage for the gums.  I had a sonic care for many years and after it died I went back to to a regular toothbrush.  Recently my stepfather had gum surgery(for receding gums) and I was inspired to become more proactive with my oral care.  I did research (looking in stores and reading info online) and chose this product.  I am VERY happy and feel good about taking care of my teeth and gums.  This product is easy to use. FYI:it will keep going until you turn it off.  The first time I used it I think I brushed for 5 minutes.  I thought it would shut off after 2 minutes, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This brush was recommended by my daughter&#x27;s dentist after she had her braces put on to ensure thorough cleaning around the appliances.  The brush is fantastic!  It stays charged for almost two weeks after the initial charge, comes with a carrying case so she can take it to school for mid-day brushing and it has a two minute timer to ensure she brushes thoroughly.  I would recommend this product for anyone who has a child with braces, as she actually enjoys brushing now!</li>
    <li> I replaced a much older oral b with the triumph model and it brushes circles around the older model. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush, but it took a while to&lt;br /&gt;get used to it. My teeth are whiter than ever,&lt;br /&gt;and it took less than 2 weeks to get them that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I miss from my old Oral B is the&lt;br /&gt;2 minute timer.</li>
    <li> I have had mine for a short time only and thus far it works fine. My teeth have never been cleaner.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent toothbrush. It cleans very well and has several settings. I used an older version, but this one is much better.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd Oral B electric brush in my house.  It replaces the previous generation which went bad after 4 years of multi-person daily usage (the brushes are interchangeable so this is not an issue). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I stick with the more expensive Oral B product because of the design and material quality.  The new Triumph series is available with some excellent new heads for deeper cleaning.  One of Oral B&#x27;s greatest weaknesses has been the lack of brush-head varieties.  The Triumph series finally solves that with a much deeper cleaning &#x27;flossing&#x27; head design.  This is a HUGE improvement over the standard soft bristle design I&#x27;ve been accustomed to.  It also makes it more competitive with the other brands which have offered a wider variety. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The LCD display is useful since it lets you know the status of the battery and the duration of your cleaning session.  There is a fairly useless mode selector which allows you to cycle between different brushing methods depending on the head you are using. But it seems gimmicky and less effective than the regular brush mode. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I didn&#x27;t buy the Triumph for its new features, but it helped entice me to keep loyal to the brand after the old one retired.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a fresh new design with the features and quality you expect from Braun</li>
    <li> This is the best buy that I have made . It&#x27;s a great product my teeth and gums have never felt better. It was worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This was my first electric toothbrush purchase and I&#x27;m a happy convert now.  It really does feel like a dental cleaning after every brushing.      I did a little bit of research and decided to get this one because hey, I won&#x27;t deny it--I like my stuff well designed.  I thought the form factor of this brush was much simpler, cleaner, and less bulky than the other electric toothbrushes out there with similar features.    I really like how the charger base is convertible from one that houses the brush heads (up to 4) to an extremely minimal base that is just the charger only, not much bigger than the base of the brush itself.  I haven&#x27;t traveled with it yet but I&#x27;m looking forward to having this brush with me when I do, especially with the nifty travel case.    I&#x27;m sure not many people care about LCD screen all that much, but I for one appreciate the little smilie that shows up for a few seconds after you&#x27;ve completed the 2 minutes.  It makes me smile!  What other toothbrush makes you do that?    Another major plus is how easy it is to attach and remove the brushhead, which makes cleaning after every use totally doable and moreso, easy.    Some think that this brush is a little overpriced, with unnecessary features, but I think the form factor and design of this brush, added with its effectiveness in cleaning, makes it worth it.</li>
    <li> Refills are easy to find.  Fit well. Color coded.  Easy to change out.  I&#x27;m satisfied.  I think I had a Cybersonic before and wasn&#x27;t crazy about it,although it worked well.  I&#x27;m much more satisfied with the Oral-B.</li>
    <li> Dentists had been recommending power brushes to me for years.  Finally I broke down and bought this one.  The reviews for the Triumph and the Sonicare were both great - I chose this one because the brush head is smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for a little less than a year and I really like it.  My teeth feel cleaner than ever and my gums feel better.  I also like the polishing mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 11-28-08:  This thing stopped working last week.  I had it for maybe two years, and I do not think that is acceptable.  I liked it, but it didn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long, and now it won&#x27;t charge at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered a Sonicare.  I hope that lasts longer and works as well.  This is WAY too much money to spend on something that lasts about two years.  If it would let me, I would change my rating to two stars.  It did a great job, but now it&#x27;s useless.</li>
    <li> I have both the oral-b and the sonicare. the sonicare has a tingling sensation and is very splashy and i couldn&#x27;t brush my tongue because of it.  &lt;br /&gt;The oral-b is very convenient to use. I can brush the back of my teeth and tongue and it doesn&#x27;t splash. The 30 second timer is annoying at first but i got used to it. &lt;br /&gt;I now use the oral-b but i kept the sonicare in case i crave a tingling sensation. &lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because it is a bit on the heavy side.</li>
    <li> I like this tooth brush, and think it&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s higher price.  After a year, I still brush much longer than if I used something else.  It does a great job on plaque.  It&#x27;s better than my Sonicare, but it does require more cleaning.  The tooth paste collects on the head and base of the brush.  I only use one of the speeds, and do not use any of the different brush options.</li>
    <li> The triumph toothbrush is very high quality. The triumph cleans all areas of your teeth, i have a very small mouth and the brush heads fit very easily in my mouth without any problems. The triumph is very powerful and will blast all plaque off your teeth after only a couple of uses when using the power floss head. The lcd screen is very nice to have showing how much battery power is left. Very nice travel case also. You will be very pleased with this product, i highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Fantastic. I had always been too cheap to buy an electric toothbrush. Now I wish I had bought one a long time ago. I like that this one vibrates every 30 seconds, to tell you to move on to the next quadrant. It really does a great job. I think I would have saved on Periodontist bills if I had bought this toothbrush years ago. My teeth feel so clean after I use it. It gets rid of every bit of plaque. I can&#x27;t really tell the difference between the flossing brush and the polishing brush. The different speeds are unnecessary. I only brush on the highest speed, and I would think most people would do the same. The display is very easy to read.  Great toothbrush.</li>
    <li> my teeth feel really clean...like I just went to the dentist.  Great product.  Does Amazon sell the replacement brushes?</li>
    <li> I had a cheap $20 Oral-B Vitality before this and it did the same job.  The Triumph is a little more powerful, but I&#x27;m not sure that justifies the price.  I personally don&#x27;t use any of the additional features that come with the triumph.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive gums so I don&#x27;t need the soft setting.  I don&#x27;t feel the pulsating power of the massage setting is better for your gums than the normal setting.  I don&#x27;t tend to brush too hard so the changing pitch isn&#x27;t necessary.  And I have a pretty good idea of when I have been brushing long enough without the brush telling me.  So I would only recommend the Triumph to people tend to brush too hard since it is the only Oral-B with a pressure sensor and can help prevent a serious problem.  Everyone else would probably be happy with a low to mid priced model.    After 6 months the only design flaw I have noticed is that the shaft that drives the brush head will rust if you don&#x27;t dry it off after each use.</li>
    <li> When someone suggested this product to me I thought he was just trying to make a sale (it was my dentist) but I went to work and a few of my co-workers said they had it and liked it very much. Again I was somewhat skepitcal, but I did order it. I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love this product. My teeth feel like I have just come from the dentist office and had my teeth cleaned EVERYDAY. You know when you have your teeth cleaned you come out of the appointment and keep running your tongue over your teeth because they feel so good.............it feels that way everyday and it has helped my gums as well. I love it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Our family has used the Oral-B power toothbrushes for several years now. The original model lasted a good 3+ years with heavy use. We bought this model as a replacement, but it lasted not much more than a year. It simply stopped working one day. Judging by the moisture that was getting into the LED screen, I suspected that it suffered a short. Thinking that it was just a defective unit, we went out and bought the same model. This time, it came with two of the power toothbrushes. In less than 6 months use, one of the brushes has already died. It suffered the same problem as the first, with moisture getting inside the brush. One would expect a toothbrush to be waterproof. It&#x27;s very apparent that these brushes are not. It&#x27;s a shame because they do a very effective job of cleaning teeth. I will be looking at alternatives now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several electric toothbrushes and finally found the one for me. I have a small mouth and sensitive gums and this one has a \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; setting plus a small round brush head. Since using an electric toothbrush my gums have improved greatly. I&#x27;ve had this model for 3 years and just bought this one for my vacation home.</li>
    <li> My periodontist recommended this electric toothbrush and, after doing much Internet research, I bought it at Amazon, which had the best price. This is not my first electric toothbrush. Until it died, I had a Braun for years. This is much more efficient in massaging the gums and getting between teeth. Following directions and brushing for two minutes is made easier by the pulse that alerts you to a 30-second interval, followed by a smiley face after two minutes. I can feel the different in my gums and that&#x27;s the point. Simply put: highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Oral B makes a very good product, although it can be tough differentiating among all the toothbrushes they offer.  I&#x27;ve had their toothbrushes before, and they have lasted well over three years before the batteries go.  They do a nice job of brushing the teeth, and the 30-second timer is handy for letting you know when to switch to a new area of your mouth.</li>
    <li> Great price and they do a great job.  Leaves my teeth feeling super smooth every time I brush.  I picked up some different brush heads because I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the one that came in the box.  Other than that....I&#x27;m in love.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush!  i&#x27;ve had Oral B&#x27;s before, but always the cheap $20. ones.  Then it broke and circumstances prevented me from replacing it as quickly as I would have liked.  But when my birthday rolled around and i received a Amazon gift cert as a gift, i knew what i ahd to do:  by an electric toothbrush.  My teeth have been in Heaven since and my mouth feels so much cleaner.  I love the options this model provides.  Hope everyone treats their mouths / teeth to this kind of care.</li>
    <li> 1. It comes packaged so securely as to be nearly impossible to open (and I should have stopped right there, given how the rest of this experience played out).  2. The brush binds up, cuts on and off briefly and unpredictably while brushing.  And it does not shut off automatically at the end of the recommended 2-minute brushing period.  3.  There&#x27;s no way at all to SEE how long you&#x27;ve been brushing without turning it OFF to look since you cannot remove it from your mouth while turned on.  There&#x27;s a different Oral-B product with a separate timer (the Oral-B Triumph with SmartGuide Electric Toothbrush).  But that timer cannot be purchased separately.  4.  On both low and regular speed this brush shakes my head violently, enough to make me dizzy (I have to sit down to feel I am brushing safely... and can watch the clock that way, too, since the brush-based timer is of no use whatever).    5.  After only 4 uses (two more than I thought I could stand) and a consultation with my dentist, it&#x27;s back in the original package and replaced with a Phillips Sonicare.  More than dismal for a \\&quot;$139.99\\&quot; toothbrush!  6.  When I contacted Oral-B (now Crest, i.e., Procter and Gamble) they basically told me to go pound sand - actually what they suggested was since it didn&#x27;t seem to suit me I should just throw it away, which they based on the production # having been 2 years ago (as though that had any bearing on its newness).  In summation, Oral-B may be the recognized leader in toothBRUSHES and know all there is to know about brushes but they do not know the first thing about electronics.  I paid for their learning curve.  Never again.  Too bad NO stars isn&#x27;t a rating option.</li>
    <li> My dentist has been on my case about minor gum infection. ( I hadn&#x27;t been in for a teeth cleaning in a year or two) My new dentist had a real sharp hygenist. At any rate I got a Oxyfresh water pic which has really helped my gum problem out. At 60 I am lucky to have all my teeth! They were pushing the Sonicare with the cleaning system. Very pricey even at amazon. After reading the reviews the Oral B Triumph seemed to have close too or equal reviews. The circular head cleaning is awesome and the 3 quadriant burst warning and the graphics on the front of the device is neat as well. It holds a charge forever and replacement brushes seem much cheaper than the Sonic FLexcare. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> We are very pleased with the 9400. It does a superb job and every time you use it , it feels like a dentist just cleaned your teeth.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B Triumph is the best! Easy to use, easy to clean not to mention the extraordinary job of teeth cleaning!</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush and well worth the money.I am very conscious of my oral health and brush my teeth at least twice a day for at least three minutes (sometimes more) and I have not used the charger for 20 days now and still have two bars left on the battery indicator. I travel alot and not packing the charger is one less thing to pack/worry about. My teeth have never felt so clean and looked so good. My gums are shiny and healthy and I really see and feel the difference. I will never go back to a traditional toothbrush again.</li>
    <li> I first tried an Oral-B 7500 series. I didn&#x27;t like it because it didn&#x27;t have the shudders every 30 seconds and it was very harsh. So then I bought the Triumph 9425 from Costco (for only $100)!  I LOVE THIS THING!!! I started on the Soft setting for my sensitive teeth, but after only a few days I was using the Clean Setting and it didn&#x27;t hurt at all! I love the way it feels like I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist.  There&#x27;s not much vibration. It has a polish and massage function which I haven&#x27;t used yet, but I will.  It also has a smiley face when you&#x27;ve completed your 2 minutes, which can be motivational (even though I&#x27;m over 30). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel better, and my breath is fresher! This is a great tool! I definitely like it better than Sonicare because there was too much vibration and the brush head was too large.  I love this brushhead because it fits behind and around my teeth with ease.  It&#x27;s so easy to use and you get amazing results!</li>
    <li> A great toothbrush!  My only negative comment is that if you use this toothbrush twice a day, then the battery is only good for one week (not two weeks as stated in the manual) before a new charge is necessary.</li>
    <li> I hardly right a review of products, but my dentist, yes dentist recommended this, and I have thanked him many times already.  My teeth feel clean all of the time, my gums are pink and healthy and I am brushing more than ever before.  Three times a day.  He told me not to use the polish head more than once or twice a week.  I call it the welfare toothbrush, for obvious reasons, looking at the price, but I would gladly buy it again given the opportunity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is a great product, not just for the technology lovers. I cannot appreciate it enough. The features are great. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Nice toothbrush that meets pretty much every need.  The internal clock feature that tells you how long the brush has been on is a nice touch as it really encourages you to brush for a full 2 minutes and the distinct change in vibration at 30 second intervals allows you to be aware of the time without looking at the clock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I dropped a star is that the brushheads tend to collect water/paste so you have to remove them after each use and clean the unit with a towel or the paste collects and dries under the brushhead.  Really a minor annoyance and for the quality of a brushing session it&#x27;s something that most people wouldn&#x27;t care about.  Besides almost all brushes do it and at least this one allows you to seperate the unit and clean it manually or in a dishwasher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely an improvement over my old automatic brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush at the recommendation of my periodontist.  I was having a few trouble spots in the hard-to-reach places and because I have had radiation treatments to my lower jaw and neck I have to be especially careful as periodontal surgery is not an option.  After two weeks of using this toothbrush twice a day, my trouble spots were gone and my overall periodontal health had improved.  Hard to believe that it was just the brush but it did seem to make a difference.  I travel regularly for work and the battery holds its charge for at least 10 days and that is with my using it twice a day for 3-4 minutes per brushing.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I was concerned about my purchase, having read several negative reviews about the product stopping working.  I had lost my older Braun electric toothbrush, which I&#x27;d had for several years.  I liked the specs for the Triumph, and Amazon had a great price.  All the reviews were great, except for those who&#x27;s product stopped working.  I purchased one, anyway, and have been delighted.  The best cleaning ever!  I travel a lot, and it has a nice travel charger and case, and the features all work well and are useful.  As long as it does not stop working, I&#x27;ll be very satisfied.  If it does, I&#x27;m coming for Braun!</li>
    <li> Indeed.... my mouth feels so clean after that.    Many previous reviewers have indicated the wonders of this product. I can add on by saying why I chose this over Sonic Care.     Essentially, like many others, I was deciding between Sonic Care and this Oral B since they are both king of toohbrushes, and both got rave reviews. But I bought this in the end, after researching and finding out that this supports dual voltage - that way, I can use it in UK and the commonwealth countries, while Sonic Care does not (the last time I checked.)    But I highly recommend getting either e-toothbrush... indeed it&#x27;s the best $100 most value added thing I could spend for myself!</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying my dentist recommended this brand vs. the other brand out there due to the fact Oral B works in a circular motion. Apparently that is better for your gums! So I went out and bought this. I like the product, it makes your teeth feel great. I guess what I question is the need for this \\&quot;posh\\&quot; model. First off, the 30 sec  interval timer(part of the 2min timer feature) isn&#x27;t that great, I can not distinguish the \\&quot;shuttering\\&quot; which is supposed to inform me to move on to the next quadrant of my mouth? And the LCD screen, what is the point you can&#x27;t see it while brushing! However I do like the polisher brush. I guess I would say if you are on a budget stick w/ with the older version of this model, honestly there is no true need for all the extra features of this model to make it worth droppping $100 bucks. And you don&#x27;t even get a protective cap for the head! only a storage unit which is too bulky to have on the counter. Save yourself some money and just get the older model.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Braun customer for some time, using their electric toothbrushes, updating as new products come along.  The new Oral-B Triumph is just that...a triumph of design and engineering.  I feel, when finished brushing, that my teeth are cleaner than even previous Braun products have managed.  The signaling every so many seconds (to move to a different quadrant of the mouth) is really neat...and the larger brush head has been no problem at all.  There may be those who disagree, but I&#x27;ve felt, but never more than with this new product, that the electric toothbrush does so much more for the maintenance of my teeth and gums than the standard toothbrush...the Triumph hopefully will allow me to keep my own teeth in my mouth for an even longer period of time.</li>
    <li> Wow, wow, wow. This power toothbrush cannot be even compared with a normal toothbrush. It is really a next generation device, which beyond doubt cleans teeth better than anything else I have ever used. A close friend of mine was very happy with it. I had used so far normal toothbrushes but decided to give it a try. Well, I am so glad that I did. The price is also very acceptable given the superior cleaning and even whitening. It is that good. Highly, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I got this new Oral B brush after my last one died in Europe (apparently it was a victim of European voltage differences).  I was looking for a while and trying to decide between the Oral B and Sonic Care, which my girlfriend had been using for years.  I really liked my old Oral B, and had been using it for about 2 years.  So when I saw that this new version had come out, and it had a voltage regulator to support voltages around the world, I thought I was set.  It was a big disappointment when I first turned it on.  It&#x27;s got to be one of the loudest toothbrushes out there - sounds like a drill or some other  powertool when it&#x27;s running.  It&#x27;s probably 2-3 times louder than my original Oral B.  The other problem is that the handle is much thicker and much heavier than the previous model.  I have small hands and found it to be cumbersome to hold, not to mention just too heavy.  I think the engineers at Oral B went overboard on this model.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for more than a year.  I won&#x27;t get into all the interesting functionality; several reviews here do that very well.  This works great at cleaning your teeth and making your gums feel good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have a problem with the battery life.  I don&#x27;t know exactly what I ought to have expected, but I certainly expected better.  After less than 1 year, the battery began to wilt after just a few brushings.  With two of us using it only for our evening cycle, we are finding it necessary to recharge it every couple of days.  With the price we paid for it, I would think it would last longer.  I could have purchased a lot of manual brushes for the same cost. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I remember it having a one year warranty, though I never sent in the card and have since lost the manual.  This is my fault.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  good toothbrush, but send in your warranty card and keep the help-desk number.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several toothbrushes over the pass years and this is by far the best one I have had.  I previously had the Sonic and Oral B Professional units but the Triumph Professional is a welcome new replacement!</li>
    <li> The entire braun pro series DOES NOT OFFER BATTERY REPLACEMENT!!!  $160 for a toothbrush and you have to throw it out after the battery dies???  Proctor &amp; Gamble strikes again.  Throw it away and buy another one is exactly what braun customer service told me!!!    PLEASE CALL BRAUN CS 800-566-5752 ask about battery replacement. this is truly a horrible thing. THrow it away in the landfill after 2 years, with the metal hydride battery (again in the landfill) all because P&amp;G wants you to buy a new $160 toothbrush always instead of a $5 battery.    DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> Claims aside, this is the only toothbrush I&#x27;ve used that&#x27;s truly made a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> good speed, but the brush head is oval shaped and larger than the usual oral b (i&#x27;ve been an oral b user for the last several yrs) i&#x27;d been using so it was a bit harder to manipulate around the teeth and mouth.  plus, the bristles wore down a lot faster too.  however, still a good purchase b/c i like that it does clean a bit better than the older models.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush. I espically like the battery display telling me when it needs to be recharged and my teeth have never felt so clean, so so much better than my old electric.</li>
    <li> I own this toothbrush and think it is the best toothbrush on the market, well worth the money. I drink a lot of coffee and tea - both stain your teeth - upon recommendation of my dentist I purchased this toothbrush after my last cleaning and to my amazement I have managed to keep the stains off my teeth. My gums were a little sore at first, but they have adjusted to the brush and now I have a beautiful smile, stain free!!! I have owned many electric toothbrushes but this is the best, hands down. &lt;br /&gt;Connie - Sanford, NC</li>
    <li> After two months my teeth do seem cleaner, if not whiter. I would like it if they offered firmer bristles and/or more intense gum massage. Overall a great product that is easy to use. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Consitantly, everytime I use my Triump, I say to my self \\&quot;self, this is the cleanest your mouth has ever been without the pain torture of being at a dentist\\&quot;.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My dentist was pushing this system on me for years. I never had intention of buying a tooth brush that was in the 3 digits. However after a sobering visit to the dentist where I was shown some signs of gum disease and new cavities, well I said \\&quot;what the heck\\&quot;, let&#x27;s buy this overpriced toothbrush.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So as of last visit with using the Triumph for 3 months my destist reports that my gums are improving. My wife says that my teeth look cleaner and whiter than before. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I know I love the pros and cons, so I will provide you with some: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PROs &lt;br /&gt;* Idiot proof teeth brushing (uses a timer to help you know when you move to the next section of the month) &lt;br /&gt;* Fights gum disease &lt;br /&gt;* Cleans your teeth almost as good as the dentist, without the pain of the dentist &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;CONSs &lt;br /&gt;* Relativly expensive to inferior electric tooth brushes and disposible ones &lt;br /&gt;* You can&#x27;t cheat and only brush for what \\&quot;you feel is enough time\\&quot;. &lt;br /&gt;* You could reduce the income of your favorite denstist since you might have less cavities and no gum disease &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Happy brushing!</li>
    <li> i have always used power toothbrushes and this one is the best one i have tryed yet</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for over 9 years beginning with the original style and finishing with the Elite models.  Those did better than a manual brush, but don&#x27;t compare with the wonderful results I&#x27;m getting with the Oral-B Triumph.    I started taking a medication this year that leaves my mouth dry and prone to plaque build-up.  I knew it was getting bad when my wife and mom pointed out that my teeth looked yellow and breath was noticable for the first time in my life.  I&#x27;m quite meticulous about having clean teeth so this really bothered me.  The Sonicare Elite toothbrush I was using just wasn&#x27;t able to keep my teeth from building up plaque, particularly along the gum-line and between the teeth.  I got a little better results by alternating between a manual toothbrush and the Sonicare while using Plax before brushing and flossing.    Wow, I&#x27;ve only used the Oral-B for about a week and the results are dramatic.  I can really feel the floss action head working around and between the tooth as I gently rock it back and forth over each tooth.  It does a wonderful job along the gum line as well.  Plus, I&#x27;m still using the same products: Colgate Total Advanced Whitening toothpaste, Plax pre-brushing rinse, Reach Gumcare dental floss and Reach Act Restoring floride rinse.    My teeth look and feel much cleaner than before and I&#x27;m not at all self-conscious about my teeth and breath.    Only get the Oral-B Triumph if you want whiter teeth, healthier gums, and an excellent plaque fighter!  You&#x27;ll love this toothbrush whether your switching from a manual or other electric.</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas gift.  I currently use a standard Oral- B but the Triumph was alot more powerful.  It really is dentist feeling clean.  I liked the 2 minute timer.  and the smile face that pops up.  It&#x27;s the little things in life that make me smile.  LOL  I&#x27;m so happy I got this as a gift!</li>
    <li> good product works well and i got a great deal on amazon!!! what more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> I had been using an inexpensive battery powered toothbrush for several years but recently read an article about the Oral-b Triumph and how much better it cleaned teeth. After reading I decided to try the more expensive brush and ordered the Oral-B brush from Amazon. I feel that the new toothbrush does a much better job of cleaning my teeth. After the two minute recommended cleaning time my teeth and gums feel like they do after I&#x27;ve visited the the dentist. I&#x27;ve been using the brush for several months now and I believe my teeth are now being cleaned more thoroughly and effectively than they were before.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with my new brush. I had no idea this brand would make such a difference. I had Sonic Care in the past and there is no comparison as to how much cleaner my teeth feel.</li>
    <li> I have been very satisfied with the oral b 9400.  I like the timing feature that tells you when 30 secs has passed.</li>
    <li> Disregard reviews that say it&#x27;s not worth the extra money. The price on this toothbrush is now in the $60 range and WELL worth it. I just got this toothbrush, well, yesterday actually. I&#x27;ve only used it twice but so far I LOVE it. My teeth are already noticeably whiter and cleaner. I actually kept going after the two minute time buzzed because it was doing such a nice job. It says in the manual that it can make your gums bleed for the first two weeks or so (if you didn&#x27;t use an electric toothbrush previously), but I had it on the \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; setting and it was fine--no bleeding! I really really like the toothbrush. Almost all electric toothbrushes over $50 or so get great reviews because they are all pretty good! The real difference for me is the price...this one ran me $67.99 and I think it was worth every penny! The 30 second quadrant alarm is pretty nice, but I usually brush my teeth for a total of 4 minutes so I do two rounds on each quadrant! If you can get it for around $60-70, you are doing well. The setup is easy and using the toothbrush is easy too. A GREAT investment in your dental health. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> When I went to my dentist every time, she told me I am not brushing my teeth properly. I had 6 fillings last year and a bridge this year. When I asked her, if a electronic brush would help and asked her if Philips sonicare is a good one, she told me I might want to try this one. And voila, this one is great. Though I dont like to flush everyday, I always did with reluctance. But since I started using this brush, I saw I can actually flush once in 2 days.. I like it very much it cleans  well, reaches every cornoer of my teeth and though it does not replace flush, it does some of the flush action too. So highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This product is sold as model 9400 but it is not. Its model 9000. The difference is in the content of the LCD display. I prefer the model 9400 user interface.</li>
    <li> I had never before used an electric toothbrush.  I bought this one because it was recommended by a dentist.  Compared to my old toothbrush, this is a quantum leap forward.  I brush longer and more thoroughly now.</li>
    <li> I depend on reviews from other in deciding to purchase a product so that it is only fair that I return the favor.  This toothbrush is great.  In many ways I feel like I am getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist.  We bought 2 of them and now I wish I bought more for family members who now have their own home.  Pleased be advised that only one toothbrush comes with the product so pick up other brushes.</li>
    <li> i had my doubts but i love this toothbrush. my teeth feel as good as if i&#x27;d just come from the dentist. recommended.</li>
    <li> After many years of laziness, I&#x27;ve finally bought this power toothbrush. I should have done this long ago. Not only does it do all the work for me, but the built in timer has actually gotten me to brush longer than I used to with any other brush. Floss action head actually gets some of the stuff in-between the teeth too. Not a replacement for flossing, but still nice.    Only downside as I see it is the hard plastic that the actual brush is made out of. Every time the back of the brush touches a tooth, I get a very interesting sensation that runs all the way down my spine.    Overall, a solid product.</li>
    <li> This is my first power toothbrush and I love it!  I have been shopping around for a while waiting for a good deal on Oral-B.  With the sale this was a great deal and my teeth feel so much cleaner.  I recommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Got a new Oral-B Triumph toothbrush for our second home.  It is a significant improvement over my older Oral-B.  More power and stronger battery.  My old oral-B collects crud on the post as moisture from my rinsed toothbrush drips down to the bottom.  The triumph doesn&#x27;t seem to have that problem.  One thing my old one has that I miss in the Triumph is a blue light to indicate it is charging.  The blue light serves as a small night light in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I went online added the item to my cart and when I went to check out I was advised that the price had gone up some $10.  This is just rude.  I canceled the order and bought it cheaper elsewhere.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend them at all.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item with a rebate coupon I got from my dentist. I reasearched the features across this and other models. This one turned out to be in the same price range and works wonderfully.     The brush vibrates every thrity seconds to let you know to switch to another quadrant and then gives a nice smilie face at the end of the two minutes.    There a couple of things of note however, 1) the base can get gunky if the bottom is not dried before putting it into the charger. Not a major problem but if you are like me and like your toothbrush handle not to be sticky you&#x27;ll need to rinse it and dry it off completely before placing it back in. 2) It didn&#x27;t come with any additional brush heads even though it has a space in the back for storing them. Again, not a big deal but I did have to create a seperate order for more brushes so that hubby could use it.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my purchase of the Triumph 9400. Tried other electric tooth brushes, and by far this one exceed all.</li>
    <li> I had purchased an Oral B Braun toothbrush 5 years ago. I liked it, but it was time for an upgrade.  I noticed a huge improvement right away. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. I like the idea of the option to  use the compact version of the charger.</li>
    <li> Not bad but...    (1) The handle is still way too slippery when brushing although it is less slippery than other Braun/Oral-B electric toothbrushes are.    (2) The various features are mostly unnecessary gimmicks such as 2-minute timer vs professional timer. I found at least one feature which doesn&#x27;t work despite the claims in the manual. No problem, the feature is useless anyway.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is by far the best one yet from oralb.  I have used quite a few different models of their automatic rechargeable and battery operated toothbrushes and this one is the best by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush cleans so well that you feel as if you got a professional cleaning from your dentist.  My children also love it as it cleans their teeth much better than the manual brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it only 4 stars because my unit had a dent/scratch on the lcd screen.  It seems as if it got bumped or something internally.  It doesnt have any affect on the toothbrush as far as i can see so far but who knows.  I was too lazy to return it for a replacement.</li>
    <li> I have found if you want to get 2-week battery power for the toothbrush (using it twice a day) you have to charge the battery for 24 hrs not the 12 hrs as suggested by the manual.</li>
    <li> I recently received the 9400 for a Christmas present, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. This is my second Oral B electric brush. This unit makes brushing easy, effortless, and almost fun. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush comes with so many innovative and useful features such as &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* 30 second quadrant timer (can be set to a two minute timer) which is very useful. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;* LCD, although you can&#x27;t see the display when you are brushing it is nice to see exactly how long you&#x27;ve brushed. Plus it just looks cool. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* Four brushing modes. Clean, Soft, Massage, Polish. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* Pressure sensor which will adjust so you don&#x27;t hurt yourself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* A \\&quot;smartchip\\&quot; in the brushheads that communicate with the unit to let you know when to change them. The chip will also tell the unit which brush mode to use depending on which head is inserted (For instance you insert a PowerPolisher head and the unit will switch to the Polish setting).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* A base station charger that can be removed from the larger stand. Which is perfect for when you are traveling. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* You can choose to leave the unit charging all the time with no worry about battery life dropping (as long as you discharge the battery completely every six months). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*The base station has a flip-up storage compartment for (4) brush heads. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For those of you wondering, the unit comes with one FlossAction head and one PowerPolisher head. It also comes with a travel case and charger base station.  &lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed with this unit. This toothbrush is a bargain at twice the price, and comes with a 2 year warranty.</li>
    <li> Summary: Just buy the cheapest Oral-B ProfessionalCare model you can find on the market and you will get all of the wonderful teeth cleaning the reviewers here have been raving about without wasting money on useless features.    Review:  I bought this one after the unreplaceable battery on my Oral B  3d Excel (older equivalent of the ProfessionalCare 5000) failed on me. After comparing the two, I have decided that the cheapest ProfessionalCare model they offer which costs half the price had all the features I really needed.    The key features for me are:  * Rechargeable - everything from ProfessionalCare 5000 on up is rechargeable  * High speed 3d oscilations - ALL of their models from the ProfessionalCare 5000 on up have the same rotating speed and they all do side to side and front to back movents!  * Needs to supports all brush heads - Aside from their incompatible sonic line, all their brushes support all their brush heads. I bought the Triumph mainly because I liked the idea of their FlossAction head, and on their web site they claim that it only works with the Triumph. THIS IS INCORRECT. The floss action head works with all their models!!!!!! They claim the triumph brush detects a \\&quot;smart chip\\&quot; in the flossaction head that causes it to modify the way the motor works, but all it does is restrict you to the most powerful setting. I tried the Flossaction head on my cheaper 3d excel and it works just fine.    All the other features of the triumph are no big deal - the display screen to tell you the charge, etc. All that stuff is not worth paying twice the price to me.    Features they tout as unique to the Triumph that I don&#x27;t care about:    * Multiple cleaning speeds - unless you have incredibly sensitive gums, you will just use the maximum speed every day.  * LCD display - You can&#x27;t see it when you are brushing anyway. When you are done it tells you exactly how many minutes you brushed. Who cares about that? The pulse warning after 2 minutes during the brushing(on all their models) tells you that anyway. And it&#x27;s pretty easy to remember to stick the thing in the charger once a week... you don&#x27;t need an LCD display with the exact charge. That&#x27;s overkill.  *FlossAction support - This is a great brush head but as I said above, this works in all their models even though they claim it does not.    They need to justify a higher price so they just packed on features that don&#x27;t mean much... my advice is just to get the cheapest ProfessionalCare brush model you can find and it will be just as good.    On top of all this, the Triumph display screen requires a bigger battery and is heavier, which is a slight annoyance.    Go to oralb dot com website where they do a comparison of the features of all their models. Keep in mind that their statement that the Flossaction only works on the triumph is incorrect.</li>
    <li> If it lasts for at least 2 years, I guess it will be worth the price. Seems much better than cheap power toothbrushes due to higher speed brush movement.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a power toothbrush, but I&#x27;m definitely glad I spent a little extra to get this one.  It&#x27;s a great toothbrush!  My teeth feel very clean and look better than ever, and the floss action power heads work amazingly well (though I still floss).  The 30 second timer for each zone is actually very handy.  The polisher works wonders as well.  I use the polisher in the morning and the floss action at night. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As for cons, I have one beef:  the battery.  Why do companies insist on making products with rechargable batteries that can&#x27;t be replaced, as if they have an infinite lifetime?  The manual comes right out and says the product life-cycle for this is 2 years, so I expect 2 years from this battery.  If not, I expect them to replace the brush/battery. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I didn&#x27;t find this brush bulky, hard to use, or heavy.  I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> We just replaced our old power toothbrush.  My husband and I both think the 9400 is fabulous.  Our teeth feel so much cleaner.  Hard to believe they are still able to improve on this type of product. The holder also protects four of the brush heads and has a nice appearance. The brush heads with the flossing nubs on them are great! The automatic timer is excellant and even gives you a smiley face when you&#x27;ve reached 2 minutes duration. We don&#x27;t think you should consider any other product.</li>
    <li> I paid about 100 dollars for it. I am angry at this toothbrush now, because handle didn&#x27;t work at all after charging a battery at the beginning after then one month later handle itself ran without an operation until the battery was completely discharged. I couldn&#x27;t stop it. I also tried to remove the battery by the presented instruction.  Anyway, I don&#x27;t want to buy this product any more, even though it is currently a good reputation.</li>
    <li> This was a great toothbrush while it worked. I&#x27;ve only had this tooth brush for 4 months and the handle now out of control. It just wouldn&#x27;t shut off one day. I finally realized if you put it back in the charger is shuts down. It now won&#x27;t turn back on. I&#x27;m going to try and get a replacement but I don&#x27;t have much confidence in the product.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush, but it is a little bit noisier than past Oral B models I&#x27;ve had.  I love that there&#x27;s a little smiley face when you&#x27;ve brushed your full 2 minutes, and it definitely makes my teeth feel super-duper shiny and clean.  Another great perk is that the base holds four brush heads in a convenient and stylish closable case.  The grippy handle is also a great improvement from past models.</li>
    <li> Very good except when starting.  It starts and then I have to push \\&quot;clean\\&quot; in order to clean.  How do you make \\&quot;clean\\&quot; the default for starting?</li>
    <li> This is a redesigned unit featuring some enhancements found on the Braun Synchron Shaver: LCD display, mobile charger/charger station, smart charging ability and differet brushing modes.  These enhancement are cool to have but adds no significant value to day-to-day usage sans the portability factor of the mobile charge.  The redesigned unit is bigger and heavier than previous models, definitely not a plus.  The basic cleaning principal is the same as ones in the 7000 and 8000 series, so the result is not any better or worse.  If you already have a 7000 or 8000 with Excel 3D, I don&#x27;t see much of a reason to upgrade. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I do have a big complain about how Braun package their products.  In addition to a cardboard carton, the box is sealed inside of a plastic blister pack.  The plastic is very very thick and hard with very little trim.  It took me almost 30 minutes to open it with knife, box cutter, scissors, and some other tools.  I managed to sustain cuts on my hands while struggling to open this.  I think it&#x27;s very environmentally unfriendly and consumer unfriendly to use such packaging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a vigorous and thorough manual brusher. This is the first power brush that is an improvement over my manual brushing.  I&#x27;ve tried others, like the sonicare that my wife liked but always went back to brushing by hand because it seemed to be a better job.  Not anymore.  This one really works for me.</li>
    <li> I have used Oral-B Power Toothbrushes for the last 15 years. &lt;br /&gt;This is the first one that really satisfies me. &lt;br /&gt;The biggest improvement is the LCD display that shows the actual battery status and when do you need to recharge it. &lt;br /&gt;So the times when you went for a weekend vacation and the battery is empty are gone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Another big improvement is the integrated travel charger and travel case. The base plate of the charging cradle can be removed and act as a small travel charger. This very handy if you travel a lot. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The different brushing modes are a nice add-on, but not essentially needed in my opinion. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Would i buy it again, yes every time.</li>
    <li> This item is the BOMB! I feel the difference the first time I use it. If I feel confident using this item, I am sure you will feel the same too.  &lt;br /&gt;The only problem is the cost, which will eat most of your money. Nonetheless, this item is worth every time your brush. Even though this item is too much for me to offer, I am satisfy for what I get in return (whiter teeth)</li>
    <li> Overall, I think this toothbrush is a really good one. It leaves my teeth feeling really clean (much more than a manual brush), and it is fun to use. It is not too loud, in my opinion, and the battery life seems to be good so far (I have only had it for a couple of months). The polisher has also been giving me good results. This is my first power toothbrush, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but as far as I can tell, it seems to be a good product. I only have a couple of minor complaints. I wish it could make a lounder noice when the 30 seconds for each section of the mouth or the whole 2 minutes are up. The sound it makes is so light that at times I don&#x27;t notice it and keep brushing much longer. A cap of some kind would also have been nice. I am always afraid the toothbrush will fall on the floor and get dirty, so I have to completly remove the head and place it in its case as a precaution. I wish it could also be used for flossing, instead of having to use the separate hummingbird. It is also a bit pricy, but I guess it is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I researched pretty heavily when deciding how to replace my old basic Oral-B model.  The old one had lasted me a good five years and was not holding a charge very well any more so it was time.  I finally settled on the Triumph 9400 partly due to the great deal that Amazon.com was offering at the time.  I am not disappointed, to say the least.  My teeth have never felt so clean as they do everytime I use this brush, it really is just like a dental cleaning feeling!  One major plus is that I am no longer having to use the sensitive teeth toothpaste.  After about a month of use my teeth are no longer experiencing the sensitivity and that is worth the price of the unit alone.  The charge lasts well over a week, which is long enough for me.  The display is nice, I especially like the smiley face if you go the whole two minutes cleaning time.  The only thing I can say negative is that I still don&#x27;t know what kind of toothpaste I am supposed to use with the polishing head, the directions don&#x27;t tell you.  I would buy this unit again and highly recommend it, especially if you get it on [...].  September 9, 2008 update - Still using my Triumph and still working great!  March 22, 2010 update - Still using my Triump and still working great!  Still keeps a charge for over a week too.  February 14, 2012 update - Still using my Triumph daily and works great.  Does not hold the charge like it used to, but impressive for the age.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Before I purchased this product, I had owned a Sonicare Elite 7800 toothbrush that I absolutely loved. I know it sounds stupid that I went with a different toothbrush after having one that was perfect, but I have to say that I was very impressed with my new toothbrush. They say it can do 40,000 brush strokes per minute. This was faster than my previous toothbrush, and I didn&#x27;t really know if that meant anything in the grand scheme of things. What really impressed me was when after 3 months of use, I went in for a dental cleaning and my dental hygienist was shocked to see that I had no plaque or tartar built up on my teeth. This was unlike any previous visit there. Now don&#x27;t assume that I was just some slob who started brushing when I got this new toothbrush. I brush 3 or more times daily and floss twice daily. I rinse every time I brush. I am very particular about the care of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone who is looking for a more intense cleaning when they brush their teeth. It is the Ferrari of electric toothbrushes. It has 4 useful and cool settings. It has many available brush heads for all of your oral hygiene needs. It is great. That is all I can say. I plan on having it forever, or until the battery refuses to charge anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have something against Oral-B, then I would recommend this toothbrush instead, which is great as well.[[ASIN:B0009JRH0I PHILIPS SONICARE PROFESSIONAL ELITE 7800]]</li>
    <li> I was disappointed after I began to use this and went for a checkup, the dentist said I wasn&#x27;t cleaning good enough and when I had the sonicare, all good reports from the dentist. The carring case is nice and the set looks fancy.  I don&#x27;t even use the polishing mechanism because I can&#x27;t find any polish...or maybe I am supposed to just use toothpaste?</li>
    <li> I just got this for Christmas, so I&#x27;m still getting used to it.  It is easy to use.  I like that it has a covered compartment for the different toothbrush heads.  There is a &#x27;soft&#x27; speed, but I wish it was a little more gentle.  Overall, this is a great toothbrush.  It came with the flossing head and the polishing head and I also got a pack of the regular heads.  The flossing head was a little harsh, I was scared to use it on my front teeth, but the regular heads worked fine.  If you are planning on purchasing this particular toothbrush, I suggest picking up a pack of the &#x27;Oral-B EB17 Flexisoft&#x27; heads as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for about 3 months now.  Previously, I had a much cheaper $30 Oral B electric brush.  Even at such a high price, this toothbrush is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the brush has four different pulse settings, so you can also massage your gums, and polish your teeth.  I did not find the massage feature very useful at all though, and just use the normal \\&quot;clean\\&quot; setting for my gums.  The brush also comes with a polishing head that looks just like what your dentist has.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times, but not enough to tell if it&#x27;s working.  The instructions for this brush weren&#x27;t very detailed and I&#x27;m unsure of when to use it.  Do you use it every day?  Do you use it instead of the regular brushing?  The manual doesn&#x27;t say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice feature is that it comes with a traveling case with room to hold extra brush heads.  My old electric brush didn&#x27;t do this so it&#x27;s nice to be able to take this on long trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The normal brush head is great. It has four rubber strips on the sides that are used for flossing.  I&#x27;ve actually stopped flossing since getting this brush because it feels like these things are doing it for me.  I&#x27;m not sure if you even need to floss with this brush. The other great thing is that the brush can actually determine wear in the different heads and tells you when it&#x27;s time to replace one.  Although after 3 months I haven&#x27;t had to do that yet and the brush still looks fine.  The brush also has a visual indicator like most brushes that shows you wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the best thing about this brush is how much it motivates me to brush my teeth.  Before I usually brushed my teeth once a day, sometimes twice, for about 30 seconds.  With this brush, I now brush at least twice a day for 2-3 minutes each time.  It has a digital 2:00 timer on the brush, and gives you a warning every 30 seconds.  What this does is allow you to brush your teeth in 4 different quadrants. By focusing on a quadrant for 30 seconds (which most dentists recommend), I find that it&#x27;s much easier to brush for 2 minutes and the time goes by much more quickly, and I don&#x27;t get bored.  This is the main thing that makes the brush so great.  Plus, you&#x27;re ensuring an even brushing over all your teeth.  The visual display is somewhat useless because you can&#x27;t see it while brushing.  This makes it difficult to change the brush mode, since the brush has to be on for you to change it.  You pretty much have to just memorize the brush settings order, because toothpast flies everywhere if you take the brush out of your mouth to put it on a different settings. This wasn&#x27;t very well thought out by Oral B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone thinking about getting it who may be hesitant of the price.

    <li> My teeth feel as I have been to the dental hygienist - every day! I love the timer reminding me when to move to the next quad...my kids love it too!</li>
    <li> this was by far the best power toothbrush I have ever used and I have gone through 3 different ones.  I expected to settle with the Sonicare but this Triumph tops all of the Oral-B powerbrushes and all of the Sonicare models.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Efficiently cleans your teeth! No more missed spots, really makes your mouth feel clean and fresh. It is noisier than others but it does the job.</li>
    <li> I have had problems with my teeth for years.  I decided that an electric toothbrush might help.  I did a lot of research before deciding on this one.  It hasn&#x27;t disappointed me.  I was really interested in the floss cleaning action head.  I really didn&#x27;t feel that I needed all the bells and whistles that the new 9900 model has.  Basically this brush has the same features except one less brushing mode and it doesn&#x27;t have the wireless display.  Quite frankly, I really don&#x27;t see the sense in the wireless display. I think it would be hard to keep an eye on that and brush at the same time.    I couldn&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth felt after the first time I used the brush.  I felt like I just walked out of the dentist office.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth are even a little whiter now too.  It is a little hard to get use to if you&#x27;ve never used an electric brush before.  After a month of use,I&#x27;m use to it.  The recommended 2 minute brush time flies right by.  I get a little happy smiley face on the display when I&#x27;m done.    I read 1 review that they writer was disappointed in the floss action head.  They complained that it doesn&#x27;t replace flossing.  Please note that it&#x27;s specifically mentioned on the box that it won&#x27;t replace flossing.  I find it really does a great cleaning job!</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush as a replacement for an older Oral-B toothbrush that finally died.  I must have had that toothbrush for at least 10 years and I loved it.  I&#x27;m not as happy with this new one as I should be for what it cost.      It&#x27;s a little larger in size and heavier than the older one.  The display screen is kind of fun but it only displays images when the toothbrush is running and when it&#x27;s running you need to have it in your mouth to keep from splattering everywhere.  So, you can&#x27;t really see the display.      The on/off button and the speed selector button seem to be located right where I grip the toothbrush.  I keep turning it off and/or changing the speed without intending to change it.      One of the features that made me select this toothbrush is the fact that it will run for approx. two weeks on a charge. I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to check this. The first 9400 I bought had a defective charging system so I had to return it.  I think there are some lower priced Oral-B Toothbrushes that I would have been happier with.</li>
    <li> Funny how the little things in life can make one so happy- this toothbrush rocks! It is like giving your teeth a vacation from all the crud that normally coats them. If you have any doubts whether this is worth it- just do it! Your teeth will thank you.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist finally convinced me to use an electric toothbrush, and recommended the Oral-B Triumph Professional.  It is the best decision I have made in quite a while.  It is extremely well engineered and well made.  I like the built in timer that helps you to remember to brush each quadrant of your mouth for at least 30 seconds.  It is very easy to use, and has three speed settings.  The base unit is pretty cool--you just stand the toothbrush in the unit, and it charges the battery, no plug-in, no fuss.  Finally, it is really easy to keep everything clean.  I have no doubt whatsoever that I am getting a better brushing than I ever have. The small brush head makes it easier to get to those hard to reach places in the back.  I highly recommend this toothbrush. A great example of a well made consumer appliance.</li>
    <li> The 9400 PC power toothbrush has exceptional power to clean teeth and even polish them as compared to the Sonicare.  Also the Sonicare battery failed after 18 month of use (would not hold a charge).  The PC 9400 battery has held charge well with two people using daily for one week.  We are well pleased with the performance and value.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is amazing it really cleans your teeth to remove the plague and whiten your tooth naturally. In comparison to the Sonicare you&#x27;ll notice the Oral b triumph moves in-and-out 40,000 times per minute &amp; side-to-side 8,800 times per minute. Compare the Sonicare 9500 produces 31,000 bristle sweeps per minute no side to side movement. Their replacement heads are cheaper and easier to clean too. I even bought another for my father I liked it that much. I recommend you buy a rechargeable toothbrush even if it is the sonicare because the pulsations you get per minute are three to four times the pulsations you get from a non rechargeable toothbrush. You&#x27;ll notice the difference after one use &amp; I like to brush now more than ever before because of how clean I feel. I also want to mention the picture of the toothbrush is wrong it is not the 9400 model being shown, however I got the 9400 from amazon as the product describes.</li>
    <li> This is the first electrical toothbrush that I bought and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results spending only a couple of bugs on it.</li>
    <li> If you have children that always seem to cut short the time spent brushing, this is a great toothbrush. The toothbrush splits the time spent brushing into 4 time periods. After 30 seconds of brushing the top front, it will pause slightly so you will then go to the front back, etc... It is great for my children because not only does it remind them to change parts of the mouth, but it also gives a happy face on the screen if they complete the entire 2 minute routine. My kids love to tell me that they have gotten the happy face! I also have a happy face knowing that they are getting cleaner teeth!</li>
    <li> Our dentist recommended this brush as the best available. It was much more expensive locally. We are pleased. With free shipping since I am an Amazon Prime member, I feel that we got a deal on a superior product.</li>
    <li> I have been using electronic toothbrushe&#x27;s since their inception.  This is by far the best overall brush for cleaning and massaging the gums.  Great for us old guys!</li>
    <li> I like this item. after being charged, it can be used for about five days for two person.</li>
    <li> Does anyone happen to know what&#x27;s the input voltage for this toothbrush?    Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this primarily on price (secondarily based on reviews) to replace my Philips unit that died many months back.  After going without and electric toothbrush my exams got progressively worse, so I began shopping around for a new unit.  This one works well; no surpises.  It feels different than the Sonicare - more aggressive to my senses.  It&#x27;s easier to clean and dry, and the LCD battery level indicator is nice (no surpises).    No regrets buying it.</li>
    <li> Great brush, but if you try to change the battery, it self-destructs. You only get one battery usage and then throw it away. Designed obsolescence. This should be against the law.</li>
    <li> I have never used an electric toothbrush before this one. But it is clear to me this is an excellent product. My teeth felt noticeably cleaner after two uses. It&#x27;s a great toothbrush for traveling...charge lasts for two weeks and the charger works in outlets other than the standard 120v ones we have in the US.</li>
    <li> At first the toothbrush feels a little odd but it works very well. My teeth feel and look much cleaner and whiter. I don&#x27;t have any issues with the functioning of the toothbrush and I think the timer function is helping me brush for the recommended length of time. I am so pleased with this product I&#x27;m going to buy one for another family member.</li>
    <li> Once again, Braun has produced a fantastic power toothbrush.  The excellent results I receive from using it twice a day are proven at every dental appointment.  The new Floss Action brush head also feels and looks promising.  I know it does not replace flossing, however, it does seem to remove more food particles.  I am looking forward to trying the Pro-White brush head.  I like the fact that there are different speeds and also the 30 second and two-minute timer.    The only disappointment (for me) was the somewhat large storage tower.  I am not able to use it since I keep the toothbrush on a \\&quot;medicine-cabinet-size-shelf\\&quot; in my vanity.  The tower is too large and the door will not close, so I am only able to use the small holder and have to keep the extra brushes in another area.    I also found the charger to be of an awkward size and shape.  I have a custom configuration in my vanity (DIY) to allow easy plug-in of chargers without having power cords hanging everywhere.  I used this frequently with my older Braun toothbrush.  However, I cannot use this feature now because of the large odd-shaped charger.    Even with the small disappointments noted above, I give this toothbrush five stars!</li>
    <li> Our family of 7 justt bought 1 one these tooth brushes a month ago. Now this is the second one we bought for our other bathroom. The brush is amazing and your mouth feels so clean afterwards. And now, I actually brush for 2 minutes with a digital timer built in and a vibration every 30 sec. to tell me to switch to the other quadrant of my mouth. Its worth the high price!</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush.  It really does seem to be getting at the plaque and tartar on my teeth.  They look and feel cleaner.</li>
    <li> At the outset, I must confess that I have very crowded teeth and an angled overshot bite.  Dentist after dentist has recommended that I go through years of orthodontal treatment.  However, in my late forties, I am not motivated enough for this ordeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the above situation, it is imperative (and very difficult) for me to keep my teeth clean.  The best way is to floss diligently on a daily basis, which I am mostly too lazy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several years ago I purchased the Oral B Excel 3D power toothbrush.  This brush is still going strong (albeit with  reduced battery pereformance) and has now been bequeathed to my wife, who has near perfect teeth.  The Oral Excel brush did wonders to my teeth and gums, allowing me to narrowly escape tooth loss and gum disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I decided to acquire a newer power toothbrush.  I researched the Phillips sonicare product and the Oral-B Triump 9400.  The Phillips uses special toothbrush cartridges - it has received very good reviews.  Unfortunately, it is a rather big and unwieldy brush; not quite the product for a business traveller making constant trips abroad with aircraft cabin luggage space constraints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Phillips ruled out, I purchased this Oral B brush from Amazon.  The price was very competitive compared to local merchants in the Houston area. The new brush is larger than the Oral Excel 3D.  It has a very large charging base that can be removed and stored when travelling light - nice feature.  The little LCD panel gives you a smiley figure if you brush longer than 2 minutes.  Toothpaste is applied externally unlike the Phillips cartridge system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first attempt at using the brush was very positive - the brush handle has heft and the head feels strong on the teeth and gums, much more so than the Oral 3D Excel.  I did not have any bleeding problems unlike some other reviewers.  After a week of use or so, I could feel that my teeth and gums felt cleaner and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spotlight reviewer here has amply detailed many of the features of the brush.  I have yet to use the polish mode but plan to do so soon.  The heads are very expensive but about two months of daily use does not seem to have visibly deteriorated my first cleaning head.  The LCD panel is supposed to tell you when the head needs replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I visited my dentist last week after over one year.  He said that my teeth and gums were in good shape and just needed superficial cleaning.  No mention of orthodontal treatment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this brush can do wonders for my crowded teeth, it will do miracles for yours!  Highly recommended..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spotlight reviewer here has amply detailed many of the features of the brush.  I have yet to use the polish mode but plan to do so soon.

    <li> Basically there are only 2 types of motorized toothbrushes that you should look at and they are the Sonicare and the Oral-B.  I used the Sonicare for about 1.5 years and thought it was working well until my dentist told me that I was starting to have receding gums.  While I cannot blame the Sonicare, in my opinion I think the Oral B is gentler on your gums.  There is also a \\&quot;mild\\&quot; setting which is easier on your gums which is not an option on the Sonicare.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush ever!  I&#x27;ve bought several as gifts and everyone loves them.  I&#x27;m brushing now more than ever because it makes your teeth and gums feel cleaner, fresher and healthier than getting a teeth cleaning from the dentist.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I immediately noticed two things once I begun using the Oral B triumph over a manual brush. First, it has never been so easy to brush the hard to reach areas of your mouth - the combination of the long head and powerful brushing really made me notice a difference in the back. Secondly me teath never felt this clean before, this brush just left my mouth feeling clean. I recommend anyone thinking about switching to a powered brush from a manual to give it a try - you won&#x27;t be dissappointed.</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure about getting this in the beginning... why spend so much when you can just get a manual toothbrush for a buck?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perks:&lt;br /&gt;- Travel case&lt;br /&gt;- Quick to re-Charge&lt;br /&gt;- Gentle brushes&lt;br /&gt;- Brushing modes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using just regular Colgate anti-cavity tooth paste, my teeth have become -noticeably- whiter than before when I used a manual toothbrush... I didn&#x27;t expect it to work so well!</li>
    <li> I am a bit of a dental hygiene freak and was using a Sonicare AND a Braun (model was about $60 when I bought it 5 years ago) electric toothbrush before I bought this one. This has more than replaced both of them.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The brush head on this is larger than either of the other two were but I have decided that this is actually a benefit for me; I have a tendency to push too hard on my toothbrush and the larger size of this one has trained me to simply rest the brush head on my teeth and let it do the work rather than applying any pressure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I keep my mouth in good shape but I have had a couple spots on back molars where the gum was beginning to recede. Using this brush has actually reversed that process. I don&#x27;t know if it is the action of the brush or just that I don&#x27;t press so hard while using it, either way it is an improvement. Since using this, my mouth always has the \\&quot;just had your teeth cleaned\\&quot; feel.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is a little pricey but it is very well made and functions extremely well, so I consider it well worth it.</li>
    <li> Great quality and even better results.  I appreciate that the overkill plastic base is optional, and you choose to keep only the slim charging base.  Feels good in the hand and is very responsive.</li>
    <li> I attempted to find out though all previous reviews which one is better? &lt;br /&gt;Sonicare or Braun? Now I know. I used to have Sonicare from the time they first came out and loved it. But I was curious if Braun is as good and bought the new Braun. I must say that they are not equal! I would compare Sonicare to Mercedes and Braun to Traband (the worst east German car ever). &lt;br /&gt;--It is loud and feels like a drill. Sonicare truly sound like sonic wave toothbrush.  &lt;br /&gt;--When it lets you know that you need to switch sides, it sounds like a pneumatic drill--literally! &lt;br /&gt;--In my experience it does not even come close to cleaning power of Sonicare. After brushing with Sonicare I always had a nice tingling feeling, Braun--nothing &lt;br /&gt;--It seems inferior to Sonicare overall.  &lt;br /&gt;Here are good things about Braun: &lt;br /&gt;--When brushing with Sonicare, you have to keep mouth closed while brushing, because it splashes around (Sonic waves work through water better-closed mouth helps cleaning )Braun does not seem to be sonic wave toothbrush and you can keep mouth open while brushing with no problem. This is good option especially for children.  &lt;br /&gt;--Brush replacements are cheaper than Sonicare &lt;br /&gt;--Because of small size toothbrush, I think you can reach your back teeth slightly better with Braun &lt;br /&gt;Hope it helps.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I researched and read reviews about sonic and oral B and finally decided on the above (after two years).  I was using a cheaper version power toothbrush and I can&#x27;t believe the difference.  I LOVE this toothbrush and cannot recommend it highly enough.  I enjoy it so much I usually end up brushing for 7 or more minutes.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is fantastic. I cleans extremely well and all 3 modes of intensity are comfortable to use. The polisher is a great additional feature.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush and the battery \\&quot;died\\&quot; within the warranty period.  I took it to the designated repair facility where the toothbrush sat for FIVE WEEKS waiting for repair.   After calling Braun, I was told that the toothbrush battery replacement must be \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; in U.S. Customs.  It was very frustrating to get the \\&quot;run around\\&quot; from Braun.  After calling, Braun agreed to send me a refund by check, which arrived yesterday.  Of course, the cost of the toothbrush in the meantime has increased.   I believe the product is a good product, however, consider yourself warned in case your battery dies, too.</li>
    <li> Great product!  You can truly feel the effect it has on your teeth!  However, this particualr package came with out the Smart Guide, which was quite dissappointing.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush!  I have had problems with my gums for many years and, at a friend&#x27;s urging, recently switched from a Sonicare to the Oral B 9400.  My gums have never felt better.  I haven&#x27;t been to the dentist for a cleaning yet, but I am confident that my results will be obvious and measurable.  [I also added a water-pik ([[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet]]) to my dental regimen at the same time, but there&#x27;s no doubt in my mind that the toothbrush is the major contributor to my success.]  Get yourself one of these, your mouth will thank you!</li>
    <li> Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush.   I think this is a terrific toothbrush. It was recomended by my dental hygienist. It&#x27;s rotary action is very powerful. It does not take up much room on the counter. It is easy to angle up towards the gum line to help clean there so as to prevent pockets that may collect cavity-causing bacteria. The only drawback is that the brush attachments are a little short and sometimes I hit my teeth with it when brusing in the back of the mouth. It does take some practice to learn to use it effectively and get past the clumsiness of using a heavy object to brush your teeth. I still think this could be solved if the brush attachments were longer.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B Triumph was an excellent purchase.  The toothbrush signals the user that it is time to move to the next section for cleaning.  This is definitely good because there may be a tendency to over brush. It also lets the use know when brushing is complete.  I think this is a good tool because I don&#x27;t recall anyone telling me how much time is needed to brush each section of the mouth.  At least with this function in place I know how long to spend brushing my teeth.     I have noticed that my teeth are more plaque free compared to manual brushing.</li>
    <li> I like it. Good power. Battery doesn&#x27;t die as easily. It&#x27;s not as expensive as the 9900.. Overall a good toothbrush!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is extremely powerful and holds the charge for long periods of time and travels well.  Great product!</li>
    <li> i got it for 65 and it work really good to me.since i usually bleed when i brush my teech, i bought i for that. whats more important is that really works!good!valuable!i wanna buy one more for my girl friend, but the price just goes to 110,it makes no sense.any way, good product!</li>
    <li> The short version: Awesome, buy it.    The long version: I had another Oral-B electric that was a few years old and finally bit the dust.  I had seen the SonicCare brush at my dentist&#x27;s office and originally intended to buy that.  However after some browsing I noticed that the Oral-B has just as many vibrations/cycles per minute as the SonicCare.  Based on the great job my old Oral-B did, and the new, faster speed it was a no brainer.    I also recommend the \\&quot;floss action\\&quot; brush heads, they&#x27;re nice.</li>
    <li> The other reviews don&#x27;t lie, this is a great product and I think it works so well.  Even the features are nice and feel pretty useful.</li>
    <li> product appears to be running as it should, the only reason I say this is the last Oral B purchased, a Professional 7000 series has never worked as it should..  Thought we would try their product one more time...</li>
    <li> I had a previous Oral B and the recharging stand suddenly stopped working, and there didn&#x27;t appear to be a replacement (not a good move by Oral B), so I got this one based on the reviews. It&#x27;s good and I&#x27;m pleased.  A few points.  The every-30 second timer is actually a good thing, I figured it was kind of dumb.  I hate brushing for 2 minutes.  By letting you know when 30 seconds has passed, you then move from upper front teeth to say lower front teeth, then again move in 3 seconds to, say, lower back teeth.  It makes it WAY easier to do the full 2 minutes because 30 seconds is no big deal, it actually helps break the time up (it sounds dumb, but it actually helps).  The grip doesn&#x27;t bother me, but yeah, my older one fit my hand better.  My only real gripe is the button to control what kind of speed you want. It&#x27;s right under your hand so you constantly hit the button while brushing, if you&#x27;re not careful.  That bugs me.  But it doesn&#x27;t make the brush worth any less. It&#x27;s good.  And the travel option is nice too - basically, the based of the unit is a breakaway (well, snapaway) part that contains the actual charger.  So you can take this little bit with you when you travel, rather than the entire base, which is ridiculously and unnecessarily large.  Oh, and I called the company, this works on european 220v power, you just need to get the adapter to change the plug from a european to an american plug (get those at radio shack or wherever).  Overall, it&#x27;s good. I highly recommend.  Oh and I can&#x27;t speak to battery life, I leave mine plugged in every night.    One more thing. This Oral B is clearly quieter than my previous model. Just brushed my teeth and sat down in front of the TV - could actually hear the tv without cranking up the volume all the way.  On the last model, no way, could never heard the tv.  Helps if you get bored brushing your teeth.  And in response to some of the other criticism, I don&#x27;t notice this model making any bigger mess than my previous model, and it is painfully obvious when the model is letting you know that 30 seconds has passed - I can&#x27;t understand how anyone could not tell.</li>
    <li> I used to have a Philippes sonicare something, then four years ago i bought an Oral-b Sonic complete. I liked it so much i bought a second one about 2 years ago. For me, these things seem to have a life of about 2 years or 2-3 times a day use. Of course, towards the end of its life, the unit is basically useless for travel unless you want to bring the charger. When my most recent sonic started to die, I was so tempted to buy a third one. However, my wife has been a fan of the circular motion cleaners and i figured that is the type of cleaner the dentists use, so i decided to get this model instead. I don&#x27;t think you really need to the smart guide anyway. The first few times i used this, i sort of missed the \\&quot;ultrasonic\\&quot; feel of the Sonic complete. However, i did compare this to my sonic complete that requires a charge after each use. I&#x27;m assuming i had a full charge on both, and to be quite honest, the triumph totally blows away the sonic complete. It feels as different to me as the difference from using the sonic complete vs an ordinary toothbrush. PLUS, the recharge base is so much smaller and more portable for extended travel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in its longevity (or lack thereof). I&#x27;m going to try SonicCare next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;m doubly annoyed. I ended up getting this toothbrush again, despite it&#x27;s weak battery life because it seemed to be the only one that gives the actual time of brushing, not just a signal every 30 seconds. Only guess what? They changed the brush (the exact same model!) and no longer give the time. In fact, you can see the two customer photos here still have the time, but THOSE PHOTOS ARE WRONG. That&#x27;s a feature this model used to have, but no longer. There is plenty of room for it, and it obviously used to work. I guess they now moved the feature to the more expensive model with the separate monitor. Why would anyone want yet another piece to their toothbrush on the counter???</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Oral B Triumph for a few months now.  I&#x27;ve probably had half a dozen electric toothbrushes over the years.  It does a good job.  It is a little heavier and more wieldy than most, but nothing near enough to keep me from buying it again.  I really like how it gives a short buzz after each 30 seconds, alerting me to move on to the next quadrant, and a longer buzz after two minutes.      What I don&#x27;t like is that this is by far the messiest toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  For the first time in my life I  have occasional little projectile bits of toothpaste/saliva flying out of my mouth.  Not attractive.  And I inevitably have to wipe a few of them out of my long dark hair when I&#x27;m done.  And I&#x27;ve learned the hard way not to put on a dark colored shirt before I brush my teeth.  Yuck.  Even more annoying is that the brush and handle are hard to keep clean.  Prior to this, I always just rinsed my toothbrush then gave the handle a quick swipe with a handtowel.  Never had any problems.  This one, even when I take extra care to wipe it, still leaves little toothpaste rings on the counter and toothpaste trails down the handle.  Gross.      Overall, it&#x27;s a great toothbrush but quite frankly, so are most electric toothbrushes except the real cheapos.  Would I pay an extra $50 again just to be reminded to switch quadrants every 30 seconds?  Probably not.  I&#x27;d rather have a clean sink.  :-)</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST TOOTHBRUSH I HAVE EVER OWNED. IT IS FANTASTIC AND THE BEST EVER</li>
    <li> The Oral-B Triumph Professional Care Power Toothbrush is wonderful. It is everything it is advertised to be and better than previous models of Oral-B Power Toothbrushes.  After one brushing my teeth felt smoother and cleaner than they did using the Oral-B 7550 Professional Care Power Toothbrush and the Oral-B Triumph cleaned my teeth very well, yet at the same time it is not harsh or damaging. It is a magnificent toothbrush and I am glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an RDH and *this* is the recommend power toothbrush we sell (at no commission and for very little profit) in our office.  It is better than the lower priced versions of the other Oral-B power brushes, though I would heartily recommend most Oral-B products because of their superior quality and longevity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Triumph is different.  Yes, they all have two minute timers, but the Triumph skips every 30 seconds so you get to divide your mouth equally into four parts.  And while the floss head does work on different models it doesn&#x27;t work as effectively, still, I urge my patients to switch over to using the Triumph brush heads regardless of the model they own.  The rubber tips on the floss head brush is extremely effective at getting in-between the teeth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I usually recommend the slower mode but you do have even more than those two options, you also have a massage (for your gums)and a polishing (which is very valuable when you are in the process of bleaching your teeth.)  So, that extra brush head really is useful! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is also terribly easy (read the manual!!) to program the Triumph to notify you when it is time to change the main brush head and this applies to more than one person.  The device knows the difference between the two (or three, ect.)  My only suggestion (with any power toothbrush more than one person is using) is too write your name in permant ink on the brush itself.  The color rings just never stay on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Having been a hygienist for over 25 years and used practically every power toothbrush on the market, this is something I was very excited to share with my patients.  It is by far the most effective and versatile power toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever utilized and couldn&#x27;t possibly be a greater advocate for this product.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product.  I love the timer on it.  I have had comments on my teeth looking whiter after only a few weeks of using it.  I wish they made one for children as the brush heads on this one are too big.</li>
    <li> My old electric tooth brush died and I replaced it with this newer model and it meets all my expectations. I like the little smiley face when I use it the full 2 minutes, and the 30 sec vibrations are handy to know how long I have gone.</li>
    <li> very excellent design and operation which provides good results &lt;br /&gt;in cleaning teeth. I am concerned about obtaining replacement brushes &lt;br /&gt;for unit. Would reccomend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have owned this toothbrush for several months and am very happy with the results - especially since my most recent dental cleaning was over in record time, and my dentist said that my teeth and gums looked great. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unlike other reviews, I like the LCD display and the multiple cleaning speeds.  I find the timer very helpful - especially when I&#x27;m doing other things, like reading the paper, etc.  Sometimes I find that I&#x27;ve been brushing for 6+ minutes without realizing it.  The timer helps keep track of that so you don&#x27;t do it too often. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my wife uses the lower speed since she finds the higher speed a little too strong for her gums. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve been very happy with the results and the reduction of tartar.  I even take it with me when I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd triumph 9400 that I own.  I had a lower model and 2 mid models.  I like this one better since it has the rotating rubber tips which help like flossing.  The reason I have so many is because it is difficult to find replacement heads even in stores that I bought them from and therefore I ordered a third one.  The first one the battery died and I threw it away since I did not know how to get new batteries.  The additional ones were for replacement heads and now I have ordered six more replacement heads since they are hard to find in stores.  I also use the extra units for my granddaughter.  Your mouth and teeth really feel clean upon use and I like the additional attachments.  I definitely would recomend this and would never go back to a manual toothbrush again.  They are great for travel also.  I also own the SONIC toothbrush and bought a replacement again due to the batteries going dead.  I like it too and it works differently but I like to alternate during the day.</li>
    <li> Amazon sends you a different model from that described  in the photo and description.  I returned my purchase twice and still received the same incorrect and lesser version.  They refunded me 15% but they really should just be selling the product they advertize,...not bait and switch...shame on amazon for that.</li>
    <li> Love this thing! My second electric toothbrush by Oral-B. I had my last one for 5 or 6 years until i dropped it and cracked open the base and it wouldnt charge anymore. Bought this one and its easily the best toothbrush I have ever owned. Heads for it are a little pricey bur worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many Braun toothbrushes over the years replacing them usually because the battery no longer holds a charge after a few years or, less often, because I cannot find replacement toothbrushes for the model.  Each time I get a replacement there are improvements that make me wish I had gotten a newer model sooner.  This model has been the best model by far.  It really massages my gums and my teeth feel really smooth like they do after I&#x27;ve had them cleaned at the dentist.      The battery lasts quite a while when travelling and I like how you can strip down the charger to just the cord and a minimal base for longer trips.  The plastic travel container is also a nice plus although it could be more compact if you did not have to remove the toothbrush to get it to fit and place the toothbrush in a separate slot in the container (it has room for 2 brushes).      The LCD on the handle showing the time is not useful because you cannot see it while you&#x27;re brushing but the 30 second signal is useful to make it easier to brush each of your quadrants about the same amount of time.  The LCD does show residual battery power which helps figure out how long you could travel without recharging.      My dentist recommended the smaller head to make it easier to get the back molars.  I recommend this device to anyone who loves the feeling of clean teeth.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush as a gift.  I already have owned the Oral-B 9400 for many years and given others as gifts to my family.  This is by far the best toothbrush out there.  This model is specifically recommended and used by my dentist and all of his staff.  The delivery was very prompt as are most all products purchased directly from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Worth every dollar. You know exactly how long you have to brush and you feel like you were just at the dentist.</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; toothbrush is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. My teeth REALLY feel clean with this one. Easy to operate.</li>
    <li> I use it every day and look forward to the good report from the dentist about the useage.</li>
    <li> After a less than steller visit to the dentist last time for myself and my husband, I deceided we need to step up our dental care at home.  After looking around and talking to the dentist I deceided on this brush.  It does a great job at cleaning feels like I just left the dentist. And I like the 30 second interval timer makes brushing go by very quickly.  The best part was I found this brush at sams club in a two pack (comes with two handles, one charger, and one carry case) for $99.00.  What a steal and I figure if it saves me dental work in the future then it is worth the price.  Sams club also sells the replacement head at a very resonable price.  Here&#x27;s to happy brushing and good check-ups</li>
    <li> Or a better question is, which toothbrush did I return to the store? Easy answer, I kept the Oral-B. In beginning this review, this is a toothbrush, not necessarily my own subjective opinion, therefore someone can say one product will generally perform better than that other, considering they are not too much alike.    This toothbrush just works better than the Sonicare, Fact. From the start, I used the Sonicare more than the Oral-B, so it would seem logical to assume I would like the Sonicare better? Not so. I have faith, if you compared the two toothbrushes over a period of time, side by side, use after use, you would find the Oral-B cleans better.     I used the Sonicare for over 2 months, brushing 3 times a day. Overall, a good toothbrush. I was impressed at the beginning coming from an old battery operated toothbrush. However, I started to notice something. The Sonicare toothbrush only cleans so much, especially over time. Yes, splashing water in your mouth seems like it would do better, but the key is it does not \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; like the Oral-B does. This is key, between the two toothbrushes, is how they \\&quot;scrub\\&quot;. The Sonicare merely vibrates and it just does not scrub and remove plaque like the Oral-B does. It moves in such a small motion it doesn&#x27;t do very much, funny huh? Remember that old commercial where they stick a Sonicare in a bowl of water and it moves more water than the other toothbrush? Well, the truth is, moving water does not \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; your teeth that well. Yes, moving water is good for flossing like the Waterpik, but you need to scrub your teeth not vibrate them. Therefore, I found over time, the Sonicare did not remove nearly as much plaque.     The Oral-B scrubs like a champ, making circular, high speed motions. My teeth collect plaque easily. I&#x27;m not a hard brusher by any means. But the Sonicare does not scrub as good; you almost feel the Sonicare is just trying to vibrate the plaque away. And upon examination of my teeth, it only went so far.     Now,bring in the Oral-B and you have what feels like the Sonicare pulsing motions, with one heck of a circular scrub brush. And with the FlossAction brush it really gets in-between your teeth, almost like flossing. The Sonicare brush cannot compete here. The Oral-B also comes with an outstanding polishing brush that gets your teeth sparkling. The Sonicare has nothing close to this, it&#x27;s just designed differently. I also found the Oral-B to be better at covering my teeth, also reaching and massaging my gums better. Any dentist will tell you the importance of massaging your gums. The Sonicare has a small head and it&#x27;s much harder to cover your teeth completely, not to mention it does not scrub in between your teeth as well. This is difficult to explain, but the designs are significantly different which effects overall performance dramatically.     Yes, the Oral-B is a louder toothbrush by far. But who cares, when you see and feel how it cleans you will be impressed with it. The Sonicare does feel more durable, but the catch is, it does not clean as well. I&#x27;m buying a toothbrush that will get my teeth the cleanest, therefore I will not have to go back to the dentist and get a root canal, (been there done that) and the simple winner is Oral-B. Not only better, but now my teeth are whiter and cleaner, and I now brush less. Top that!</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush. My new dental hygenist recommended it.  The  dental office was selling a fancier version for $100.00 but this one is sufficient.  The only thing it doesn&#x27;t need is the cover for the brushes as the surface under the toothbrushes began to smell musty from no air flow within the first week.  I just removed it permanently.</li>
    <li> This is infact a good brush but not upto the mark as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As everyone stated, it has great features&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Though its a great brush, there is something missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Battery life is not that good, though they have stated as 2 weeks, i could hardly get a week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) There are no. of brushing modes, but only one speed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is, i am not completely statisfied with it though its good.</li>
    <li> My periodontist recommended I purchase a power toothbrush to really keep my teeth and gums clean.  I purchased this one because I liked the 30 second timer feature.  This is great for switching to each area of your mouth so you brush all your teeth equally well.  I have been really happy with the toothbrush so far. It has removed all the plaque build up and kept it off. In the past, I have had to scrape it off with one of those dental picks almost 3 days after a dentist visit. I do have to charge it more often than I thought I would, about every week and a half, but I leave it off of the charger until the battery is empty.  I heard this was recommended to keep up the battery life.  I gave it 5 stars though because it was not enough to lower my opinion of the toothbrush. I highly recommend this toothbrush.  It has done wonders for my teeth.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist to buy this toothbrush.  I am very pleased with the  thoroughness of the brushing action.  Can&#x27;t say that it saves time but it saves teeth!</li>
    <li> I received my article promptly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the web site when I ordered the electric tooth brush if offered a $50 Amazon Gift Certificate with the purchase.  I have not received any notification of the Gift Card.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Is that false advertisement????? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That makes me hesistate to purchase anything in the future.</li>
    <li> For full performance you have to charge battery every day. And on my toothbrush display didn&#x27;t work and I had to send it to a service.</li>
    <li> Ordered this top of the line Oral-B toothbrush . The online description is very sketchy - there is no way to know what accessories actually come with the toothbrush. Although there were several attachments that come with this toothbrush, there was only ONE toothbrush head.   Looking at the photo of the storage/recharge  unit, it looked like it might come with a couple of brushheads so that more than one person could use the handle and each have their own brushhead - that&#x27;s the way the slightly older Oral-B Professional electric toothbrush that I own came. So be aware that if two people plan to use this Triumph toothbrush you are going to have to buy extra brushheads immediately as only one is included.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several months.  I like it so well, that I purchased 2 for Christmas gifts to family members who I knew either had problems with their teeth/gums or who loved everything about keeping oral care in tip top shape.  It replaces my Phillips Sonicare. A definite step up!</li>
    <li> This tooth brush is fabulous and has saved me a lot of money in dental bills, but I am currently on my 3rd brush in one year!  The experience I&#x27;ve had is that the LCD screen retains moisture then the brush will die.  The first brush I tried to change the battery, and as the review by R.Ocamp/leonpro points out under \\&quot;Cons #8,\\&quot; once you open the mechanism that voids the warranty.  My 2nd brush did the same, but I didn&#x27;t open the brush and got a replacement via my destist, which I have had for the last 3 months and so far so good (knock on wood). I&#x27;ve been wiping the brush after every use and I don&#x27;t keep it in the bathroom for fear of moisture.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used every type of toothbrush available and this is by far my favorite. It has amazing power and after the first cleaning, I could feel a difference all day. It&#x27;s been 2 weeks and I can see a huge difference in the whiteness of my teeth. I love this toothbrush!</li>
    <li> This is probably the best tool for dental prophylaxis that I have ever owned.  Its instructions are easy to follow, the timing signals for each cleaning are immensely helpful, and so is the warning that it is time to change brushes.  My dentist approves.  It is well worth the price.  A cleric/educator I once knew many years ago cited electric toothbrushes as the heighth of consumer laziness, but I find this product a real help to my dental health.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for one that I had and was stolen!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So must be good enough that I like to repurchase the same product. The timer makes it easy to brush long enough and with 3 settings it can do other thing, although not as useful in my opinion. I think it&#x27;s most great for kids to get into the habit and do brush for full 2 minutes so they get the little smiley face!</li>
    <li> I felt that the Oral B Triumph power toothbrush did not do any better than the less expensive Oral B models. It doesn,t justify the price so have returned it to the company.</li>
    <li> This product makes it seem that I&#x27;m leaving the Dentist&#x27;s office every day - twice a day</li>
    <li> This new brush is great, an improvement from the old one that I had for over 10 years.  It was also an Oral B.  Love the LCD messages and reminders.</li>
    <li> I WILL BE RETURNING THE ORAL B TRIUMPH PROFESSIONAL TOOTHBRUSH AND THE ADDITIONAL BRUSHES.  THE ELECTRIC BRUSG WILL STOP DURING THE USING AND IT&#x27;S VERY ANNOYING.  IT WILL BE RETURNED A.S.A.P.  JOEL M HAYWARD</li>
    <li> This is my first real electronic brush. After purchasing it and using it for about a week, I can feel a significant improvement of my tooth cleanness and my gum health, it is definitely well worth the price.  I bought a really cheap ($10) electronic tooth brush (more of a vibrating tooth brush) before, and that cheap piece of crap is no where close to the performance of Oral-B Triumph. My friend have an older oral-b electronic brush that lasted him for 4 years, I believe my Oral-B Triumph will last me as long. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this because a friend recommended it and from searching the web, it seemed like dentists recommend this toothbrush more than the sonicare ones. But after using it for a month or so, I feel like the sonicare was better for my teeth. This brush is pretty rough on your teeth--it feels like it&#x27;s grinding them down when I use it, even though I&#x27;m not really even pressing the brush to my teeth.</li>
    <li> I got this toothbrush because I was getting braces (I&#x27;m in my 30s, not a teenager), and was concerned about how to keep my teeth clean during the orthodontia. Well, my teeth do get clean with this toothbrush, definitely. But I have complaints too.     As someone else remarked, messiness is an issue. Water and toothpaste and saliva drip down the toothbrush to my fingers unless I hold it at a downward-pointing angle at all times, which doesn&#x27;t feel natural.     Also, a full recharge takes a *long* time, pretty much eight hours; and on days when my braces are making my teeth sensitive, this toothbrush feels almost like a dentist drill. There is a \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; setting, which helps a bit, but on the truly sensitive days, I just turn it off entirely and use it like a non-power toothbrush. A little ridiculous, no?    I&#x27;ve tried smaller, cheap, AA-battery-powered brushes, and they don&#x27;t seem to hurt. Granted, they don&#x27;t clean nearly as powerfully either. But keep the above points in mind before getting the Braun, if you&#x27;ve got teeth that complain a lot.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a recommendation from my dentist and I&#x27;ve loved it from day 1. My teeth feel like I just came from the dentist every time I use it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush, I have only used it a couple times but so far I have seen a dramatic improvement in the color and feel of my teeth, exspecially the hard to reach areas that my old toothbrush failed to reach. I would definitely recommend this toothbrush to everyone!! It seriously does give you a dentist clean feeling!!</li>
    <li> Prior to purchasing the Oral-B Triumph, I had used an Interplak electric toothbrush for a number of years. I had been reluctant to change, but Interplak stopped manufacturing the brush heads I needed.  Since switching to the Trimuph I&#x27;ve been very happy. The motor is strong and delivers satisfactory power to the brush head; the unique pressure sensor cuts the motor when it senses that you are pressing too hard on your teeth (which leads to gum problems), and the unit is easy to clean.  In addition, the fully charged battery provides at least two full weeks of 2x/day brushing, as promised.  The only downsides so far are minor: The charging base is too big for a narrow bathroom shelf and the battery takes a while to charge fully.  But on the whole I&#x27;m very happy with this product and would recommend it readily.</li>
    <li> Previously I used a basic Sonicare and liked it a lot. But the battery died and they wouldn&#x27;t replace it. I read all the reviews here before buying this. In short, after 3 weeks of use- it works well.     Positives  -The charger is compact and multi-voltage  -The toothbrush last just over a week w/o re-charge (2 full brushing/day)  -It physically tells you to change to the next mouth area by a quick reverse on the bristles every 30 seconds.     Negatives  -Much louder than the Sonicare. Took some getting used to (it does have a slower quieter/softer setting but it&#x27;s still loud)   -The multiple brush head &amp; handle holder is way bigger than it needs to be. Takes up a lot of room on the counter.  -doesn&#x27;t auto stop after 2 mins like the Sonicare. Just reverses to let you know and keeps going.</li>
    <li> I received the Oral B toothbrush about a month ago, and it is definitely the best $80 I have ever spent! My teeth look whiter, and even my dentist complimented me. My teeth also feel clean, and are less sensitive now because the toothbrush does not allow the user to brush too hard- it applies the correct pressure and cleans teeth incredibly well. It also has a two-minute warning to let you know when you have been brushing for the recommended 2 minutes, so you never have to guess whether or not you have brushed long enough.</li>
    <li> I bought one for me and one for my roommate.  My roommate says this item scares her.  Coming from the Crest spin brush, I understand why.  This is so much more powerful and definitely takes care of plaque and gives your teeth a great cleaning.</li>
    <li> I was shocked by how well the 9400 cleaned my teeth. The battery life is longer than expected. I use it for the 2 minutes every morning and night and the battery lasts over two weeks before it dies. The battery indicator shows one bar but mine will last a week on that one bar and run at full power. The 9400 also comes with a great travel case.</li>
    <li> We now own 2 of these toothbrushes - one for my wife and me, the other for our children.  Having just returned from my six month visit to the dental hygienist, I can confirm that this brush is very effective.  I can also confirm that our children benefit from the simple smile timer.  A very worthwhile purchase.</li>
    <li> After researching the best toothbrush through the internet and by asking my dentist and periodontist,I concluded that electric brushes were significantly superior to regular ones,and that the line of Oral B Triumph electric brushes did the best job.The best brush head is FlossAction although some feel more comfortable with Precision Clean,so try both brush heads and if they feel similar,go with FlossAction.</li>
    <li> We purchased this after I dropped and cracked my previous Oral-B powered toothbrush that I&#x27;d had for 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;A must-have for us was the covered toothbrush holder.  It has vents in the back to allow the heads to dry and prevent them from growing mold.&lt;br /&gt;I really like having the 3 settings on the brush since my teeth and gums are more sensitive than my husband&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;The rechargeable battery really does last over two weeks on a single charge, even with two people using it!</li>
    <li> Have had this for 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to write a review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ring just below the brush holder got cracked and some water gets in - but it does not affect the performance of the device.  (Condensation forms and becomes visible over the LCD panel when you place it in the re-charging stand.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dropped many times from various heights - still works after all these years.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my dentist and has really improved the health of my teeth and gums.  If nothing else, the fact that there is a timer which counts down (I think it&#x27;s two minutes) will help you make sure you do a good job on your teeth.  The action of the tooth brush really gets things clean though.  According to my dentist, the way this thing works, it gives you the same effect as flossing, although she said it is not a replacement for flossing.    Had my first checkup after using this and got good results.  My gums are looking at lot better than they were previously, as are my teeth.    I had a Sonicare for several years and like this one better.  Sonicare is great, but this has the circular action, which I prefer to the back and forth.</li>
    <li> All those reviews saying how brushing with the new toothbrush feels just like after a professional dental cleaning, are made the day someone tried their new toothbrush for the first time. This review is written after 3 weeks of using the Oral-B 9400, and I will update it after 6 months, when I will have a professional dental cleaning and periodontal pocket depths measured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * with the Floss Action head, the cleaning feels more thorough than with the Sonicare Intelliclean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * the head is smaller and round, so you can reach behind the premolars farthest back in the mouth. I couldn&#x27;t do that with the Sonicare&#x27;s oval head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * the Oral-B 9400 does feel like a drill, but only for the first use. On the second use, it feels about 30% as intense as the first time, and on he 3rd use, I got almost completely used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * the handle display is of very little use, and you can&#x27;t see it anyway while brushing (usually). If you really want to see it, either brush against a mirror, or briefly stop the toothbrush, look at the display, then resume brushing. The toothbrush remembers when you left off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * with due respect, the reviewers who posted about bad button placement must&#x27;ve been clumsy. I never accidentally pressed any button while brushing. Also, the buttons need a pretty firm press to activate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * it does not replace flossing (no toothbrush does), and this is clearly mentioned in the user manual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * it didn&#x27;t get dirty (so far, after 3 weeks of use). The head is attached in such a way, through only a vibrating metal rod, that there&#x27;s not much place for grime to accumulate anyway. By comparison, the Sonicare Intelliclean developed an entire ecosystem of gunk inside the toothbrush head.</li>
    <li> The first Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 died after about three months. It showed that the battery was fully charged, but the brush wouldn&#x27;t turn on. Then, one night, in the middle of the night the brush just turned on by itself! There was also a lot of moisture that started building up inside the LCD window - althought I always dried the brush after using it. Since I bought it at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond they replaced it. The replacement brush died after just 1 month! It had all the same problems as the first one.   Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and i was pretty excited about it.  The dentist had been encouraging me to purchase one for a while.  Overall i think it is a good product, gets a good cleaning done.  Only down side is it is a bit loud.  kind of like a mini airplane.</li>
    <li> This is my second Oral-B Triumph.   The first was recommended by my dentist...and had used it for two years...but unfortunately it was stolen from a motel room.  I couldn&#x27;t wait for this replacement toothbrush to arrive.   My teeth and mouth simply did not feel as clean using a manual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I am extremely disappointed in the Braun Triumph 9000.  I purchased it on 3/04/2006 and now the battery will not charge.  I followed the care instructions and did a discharge every 6 months hoping that the battery would last a little longer, but it still will not charge correctly.  I called Braun customer service and explained the problem and was told the handle is no longer good. they said they only last about 5 years.  Perhaps Braun should advise the consumer that the unit is going to be disposed of in 5 years.  I was offered a $10 dollar coupon or a replacement handle that would cost $60.  It is very frustrating to have to purchase another handle when the whole unit costs about $100.(Sam&#x27;s club)  I have to really think about purchasing another Braun brush verses another similar product by another manufacturer.  Perhaps I will get more than 5 years out of another company.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent toothbrush it does a great job. However the NiMH rechargeable battery died after 3 years. And yes you can replace it if you have a soldering iron, a small screw driver, a sharp knife and are very careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HERE IS HOW...&lt;br /&gt;First you have to remove the bottom cap by unscrewing the center socket; the charger/plug has a triangular \\&quot;key\\&quot; for that purpose. Turn the center socket counter clock wise and remove the bottom cap with a slight twist.&lt;br /&gt;- Look inside from the bottom and press the two white clips away from the sidewall on each side with a small screw driver until you hear a click.&lt;br /&gt;- Insert the opposite end of the toothbrush(after removing the brush) into an engineer&#x27;s bench vise. Tighten the vise loosely around the flat plastic surfaces and push harder and harder toward the vise until the interior assembly slides out. (The blue seal at the top of the brush may or may not push through the \\&quot;soft\\&quot; rubber on the top of the brush). Alternately you can pry it off with a small screw driver first. DO NOT TRY TO REMOVE THE ASSEMBLY BY PULLING ON THE BOTTOM COIL. THE ASSEMBLY MUST BE PUSHED OUT AFTER THE TWO WHITE SIDE CLIPS ARE RELEASED.&lt;br /&gt;- Now that you have the interior assembly out you can cut off the battery connector strip as close to the battery end plates as possible with a sharp knife.&lt;br /&gt;- Remove the spring and plastic washer holding the battery in place.&lt;br /&gt;- Replace the battery with a 1.2V NiMh 16.7 X 48mm cell. The original battery is made by Sanyo and is a NI-MH 538MV SAN (but only 42 mm long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is an identical 42 mm replacement: [[ASIN:B00HFD8DTU Replacement Battery for Braun Oral-b Triumph Professional Care Toothbrush, Sanyo Ni-MH 2150 mAh, 42 mm Long, 17 mm Diameter]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the 48 mm version with 25% higher capacity that I used: [[ASIN:B00HFDC6HA Replacement Battery for Braun Oral-b Triumph Professional Care Toothbrush, Sanyo Ni-MH 2700 mAh, 48 mm Long, 17 mm Diameter]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Bend and cut the strips on the new battery with scissors to align with the leftover strips from the old battery.&lt;br /&gt;- Insert the new battery on a 45 degree angle and solder the negative strip first.&lt;br /&gt;- Then push the battery toward the end stop at the negative end of the battery receptor. Then solder the positive strips. Positive must be on the top (with the toothbrush standing up).&lt;br /&gt;- Re-install the spring/plastic washer assembly. It will be tight if you used the 48 mm battery (but it will fit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Insert the assembly into the cover and re-install the blue seal (it snaps into place). Lubricate the seal with silicone or salad oil, it will make assembly easier.&lt;br /&gt;- Replace the bottom cap and tighten the triangular nut.&lt;br /&gt;- Charge 12 hours before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush and smile because you just saved $100!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE, YOU HAVE TO BE SKILLED TO DO THIS JOB OR ELSE YOU WILL RUIN THE ASSEMBLY AND WASTE MONEY ON A REPLACEMENT BATTERY. If in doubt purchase a new toothbrush. Or alternatively remove the old battery first before you purchase the new battery (to make sure you don&#x27;t damage anything).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I CONSIDER IT AS UNNECESSARY ENVIRONMENTAL WASTE TO THROW A PERFECTLY GOOD TOOTHBRUSH IN THE TRASH AS SUGGESTED BY THE MANUFACTURER. YES ORAL-B INSTRUCT YOU TO RECYCLE THE BATTERY. IT MUST MAKE MANAGEMENT FEEL GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This battery replacement note is applicable to all Oral-B Triump 9400 series toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. It is also possible to remove the old battery by un-soldering the battery strips located/attached under the digital display (however I find this approach too risky).</li>
    <li> I have been blessed with good teeth my whole life.  Most all of my dental expenses are for routine cleanings.  The use of a good cleaning instrument is paramount for maintaining healthy teeth.    The Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 is a high quality electric toothbrush with a selection of utility tips for various applications.  It sports a clean design.  It is easy to use and clean.  Over the years, I have brushed with most of the top rated electric toothbrushes.  Oral-B is still my favorite.  It works.</li>
    <li> I HAVE HAD THIS TOOTHBRUSH FOR OVER A MONTH...AND I AM VERY SATISFIED. IT&#x27;S LIGHT WEIGH AND NOT OVERLY NOISY...IT CLEANS VERY WELL AND I HAVE SEEN IMPROVEMENT IN MY DENTAL HYGIENE.</li>
    <li> I have had my Triumph 9400 for over 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it on recommendation from my dentist who noticed a difference on my next cleaning and I have been hooked ever since.&lt;br /&gt;I travel a lot and was happily surprised to learn that the voltage on the charger is compatible to 220 and therefore all I needed was a plug adaptor and it charges and runs nicely in North America and all of Europe and the Middle East.&lt;br /&gt;I do need to replace the heads every 3-4 months - inexpensive if you buy them in multipacks.&lt;br /&gt;The travel case is durable and it isn&#x27;t a struggle to fit into my purse or luggage.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun electric toothbrushes for years, but there was a noticeable difference with this model - the 9400.  My teeth felt cleaner from the first brush and the floss action head did wonders for my gums. Now, almost two months later, I am even happier with the product.  It does not eliminate the need for flossing, but, in an odd way, encourages you to floss so that teeth and guns are really 100 percent. Can&#x27;t recommend more highly.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000A7W5DI Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush]]    I ordered this item on July 22, and by August 8 it had stopped holding a charge. It was the weekend, but I tried to contact Oral B anyway. Their customer service was closed. Their web site told me to take it to the nearest service center, but it found none near my zip code. It had no instructions for how to handle warranty issues if there was no service center. On Monday, I called them, delaying the start of my vacation until their service center opened, which was a 9. We got on the road over an hour late. Speaking with them, I had two choices: (1) return it to the store where I bought it (I bought it on Amazon) or (2) send it to a service center. They couldn&#x27;t tell me which center to use, since there are none in my state and their system apparently does not go beyond state lines. I had to tell them the names of my neighboring states. Their service centers few and far between, and not in big cities. For instance, in Massachusetts the only service centers are in Yarmouth and Salem. So I, like most people, have to mail the toothbrush in. Oral B makes you pick up the cost of mailing, and each service center is an independent small business. So one can hardly expect uniform service, and it&#x27;s not at all clear who&#x27;s responsible if there&#x27;s some problem with the service center.</li>
    <li> A complicated running system where it should simply shut itself off, it does not, I find it quite irksome.</li>
    <li> I am not inclined to write product reviews but this toothbrush is really great.  I&#x27;ve used electric toothbrushes for decades.  My last Braun ebrush died and I search for a replacement.  This one was more expensive but having used it I have to say it was well worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I really dislike about the product is the electrical plug&#x27;s \\&quot;wall wart\\&quot; - it juts out much more than any I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
    <li> Use it every day. Great value and does the job. And I didn&#x27;t have to pay the big mark up as in the retail stores.</li>
    <li> I had this toothbrush for probably about a year. I am not sure how long they are supposeed to last but I would think more than a year. I used it everyday, really liked it, and took good care of it cleaning and drying it after each use. One day the toothbrush fell off the base/handle while I was brushing my teeth. The metal \\&quot;rod\\&quot; that holds the toothbrush on had broken off about half way up where it is kind of thinner than the rest of the metal. It will not hold the toothbrush on anymore. I will be replacing it with something different, otherwise I will be nervous the same thing will happen again. Not worth the money if it&#x27;s only going to last a year!</li>
    <li> Great. My hygienist tells me my teeth are clean even when I skip brushing sometimes. Easy to use, cleans well, and the timer is a great feature.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush came recommended by my dentist.  I can&#x27;t believe how right he was.  Totally changed the conversations I was having with him from, &#x27;you have early stage gum disease&#x27; to &#x27;you have some of the best gums I&#x27;ve seen in a while&#x27;.  Stop thinking about it and buy it!</li>
    <li> Very good. After year of use it is still working fine.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this toothbrush for me shortly after I had a long two-year period of extensive dental work performed (involving root canals and 3 crowns).  I can&#x27;t recommend this brush enough!  I&#x27;ve not had experience with other motorized toothbrushes, but I love the resultant clean teeth and overall versatility of this particular Oral-B model.      PROS:  I haven&#x27;t had a negative dental appointment since I started using this brush.  My dentist hasn&#x27;t had to use the scaling tool on me in over a year!  I use the floss action heads* and have no intention of using any of the others, except an occasional use of the polishing head (it has a little cupped rubber head on it instead of bristles, which feels really good and leaves teeth with a slick, literally glassy surface after using it in conjunction with the Polish speed on the toothbrush handle).      It&#x27;s super easy to use -- select a speed (it defaults to the faster speed) and it lets you know with short motor notifications every 30 seconds so you know when to switch to a different quadrant of your mouth, and gives you a different motor notification to let you know the two minutes are up.  This beats egg timers and the like cluttering bathroom vanities!  It even displays a pleasant digital smiley face icon on the handle to let you know when time&#x27;s up.      The battery life is fantastic -- I don&#x27;t have to use the charger at all during 14-day vacations where I use it twice a day every day.  The low battery indicator does display right after I return home, though, so I&#x27;m not sure how long it will run beyond the flashing low battery indicator.       This may initially seem like a pricey alternative to standard disposable toothbrushes, but when you consider the price of costly (and painful) dental work that you might not otherwise need as a result of loyal use with this toothbrush, the cost of it really wins hands-down.      CONS:  My only suggestion is to completely remove the plastic brush head storage contraptionfrom the simple plug-in base.  There must be some other way to conveniently store multiple brush heads -- they probably fit just fine in normal toothbrush holders.  The brush heads don&#x27;t seem to stay put in the thing, anyway, plus it takes up too much room and the brush can stand perfectly on the plug in ring and not become slimy inside.  I used to have black slime regularly appear in the recharger ring because it would get wet and stay trapped that way in the big plastic contraption (I don&#x27;t have any issues like this elsewhere as I live in a very dry climate); ever since I fully removed that, I have had no more trouble with black slimy stuff.      OVERALL:  Since using this toothbrush for the first time, I&#x27;ve had to use a standard brush a handful of times and my mouth never feels clean after using one of those.  My mouth only truly feels clean either after a dental check-up and cleaning, or after using my Oral-B Triumph Professional Care brush.  I can&#x27;t stand the thought of the gnarly bristles on standard toothbrushes anymore and they seem completely ineffective to me.  My husband was reluctant to switch over but once he did, he admitted that he uses this toothbrush over a standard one because his mouth feels so much more clean afterward.  I&#x27;m spoiled with my Oral-B Triumph!    *Using the floss action heads doesn&#x27;t mean that you shouldn&#x27;t floss regularly anymore. . . . . flossing is still a necessary part of good dental health!</li>
    <li> I have been usig it for 1 week it works wonderful but very expensive. I guess it is worth it, time will tell.</li>
    <li> Have been using the electric Oral B toothbrushes for years as my dentist suggested.  Just upgraded to the new Oral B Triumph and all I can say is \\&quot;Wow\\&quot;!  I feel like I just left the dentist office after a cleaning.  I now brush longer because of the new timer that tells me ever 30 seconds to move onto another part of my mouth.  I didn&#x27;t think much of this feature just reading about it, but take it for a test drive and see if you don&#x27;t brush longer.  I can&#x27;t wait for my next cleaning to see what the hygentist says about my teeth and gums.  From somebody who hates the dentist and has problem gums, this is the product to help with that.  This brush gets everything, it doesn&#x27;t replace flossing, but it&#x27;s darn close.</li>
    <li> i had oral b 8850 it work very well, now i try the new 9000 model, just in November 2005 got it and the display do not work any more, i try my complain with Oral b and still have not hear from them.</li>
    <li> The tooth brush works well and is easy to use.  Need to clean the brush holder on the back of the charger. This is not fun.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Greatest toothbrush ever. Great for those of us who do not floss regularly enough. My teeth feel as if I have just come from the dentist.</li>
    <li> Typical of the evolution of Braun products,the Triumph professsional is the best toothbrush yet developed by Braun. The timing features are not new but the types of brushing and cleaning features are a welcome development. The brush head is not the standard type of brush. It incorporates small cleaning pads that leave your teeth clean and gums refreshed. It also comes with an extra brush for future use or for a family member. I&#x27;m sure that Braun will always improve its products but this is the best yet.</li>
    <li> I had used a power tooth brush for 15 years,when I needed a new brush, I bought an inexpensive unit and found that the in-and-out pulsations this model offers were not featured on it. In-and out pulsations combined with side-to-side oscillations distinguish this high quality brush. If my brush doesn&#x27;t have both motions, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than a manual brush. I also tried going back to a manual brush and found I was brushing too hard and damaging my gums. If painful descaling under the gums has been part of your dental cleanings, this brush will end that. Your time in the chair for cleanings will be short and probably painless. Definitely worth the cost, light weight, I take this brush when I travel as it has a very small charging unit. Since I already was sold on dual-motion power brushes, I found the timing devices and audible signals including the smiley-face handle display amusing and fun.</li>
    <li> this product is one of the best i couldn&#x27;t make better choice. i was looking for something that don&#x27;t leave residuo on the side of my teeth and this product did the job very well and in few days u can see that your theeth becoming clean and whiter. i recommend this product to any one.</li>
    <li> I had an earlier model of an Oral B Professional Care toothbrush for almost four years.  I really like Oral B, and my dentist highly recommended me to continue to use a similar brush.  It works great, and my teeth feel really clean.  I really like that I can get to each tooth. It has a digital timer on it so you know how long you have been brushing.  When you brush for 2 or more minutes a smile face shows up next to the time - which is kinda cute.  There are three different modes you can use to brush.  Every thirty seconds the brush will vibrate a little to let you know to move on to another section of your mouth. Then at two minutes it will vibrate twice as much to tell you that you are finished.  It has a nice travel case, which I really like.  I couldn&#x27;t really travel with my old toothbrush.  The base for the toothbrush is very convenient.  You can choose to just use the charger part which isn&#x27;t as bulky, or you can use the other parts which hold the extra toothbrushes and create a bigger base.  You don&#x27;t have to keep it on the charger all the time, although you can if you want to.  It will work off the charger for about a week&#x27;s worth of brushing (2x a day).  It&#x27;s easy to keep clean and is well worth the money!</li>
    <li> An outstanding product for optimum oral health.  A must for every family.</li>
    <li> I like the oral b triumph a great deal.  My teeth very clean when I use it. The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the expense of the brushes.  They are quite expensive.  But I guess if it saves one filling, it more than pays for itself.  I did just have an oral b that was a plain model. My teeth feeler alot cleaner with these particular brushheads.  The timer one this model is nice and having different speeds on it is also nice.  I am glad that I purchased the Triumph and if it lasts a decent amount of time, I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I love the way it cleans my teeth. It nice and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great product and work really well. I will strongly recommend this product and which can be also shared between family members. This product needs to recharge at least once a week and that&#x27;s what I did not like about this product.</li>
    <li> this toothbrush really holds it&#x27;s charge.  works great.  the charge battery indicator light is easy to read.  very powerful.  would recommend to anyone looking to upgrade to an electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Sonicare Elite for a couple of years, but have also noticed the raving reviews on this Oral B product, so I decide to try it out.  It is just like the polisher at the dentist&#x27;s office, and I want to love it, except for two things: I have a very small mouth, and I also have a couple of sentitive teeth that no dentist or specialist can do anything about.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To solve the first problem, I trim back the brush head by 1/3; but my second problem is not easy to solve.  The vibrations must have aggrevated my sensitive teeth, so as much as I believe this is a very good toothbrush, I have to give up and go back to my Sonicare, and now my teeth are back to normal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have given the Oral B as X&#x27;mas presents to some relatives.  One absolutely loves it, and says after 1 week of brushing, someone has noticed that her teeth are actually whiter.  But a couple of others are not as impressed, because they normally spend at least 5 minutes to brush their teeth, so the recommended 2 minutes are totally inadequate for them to do their job, and they don&#x27;t feel clean without adding more time.  But other than that, they still find the Oral B a good equipment.</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush to replace an old Oral B.  I love the changes! I just returned from a three week vacation and the battery did not let me down.  It had more energy left than I did!</li>
    <li> Let me just say that this brush is amazing, I read reviews and long considered buying this brush because of the price. Looking at it after owning the product for a few days, I do not regret the decision at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feeling in my mouth after each 2min brushing session is the same as going to the dentist and having my mouth cleaned, except this occurs 2 times a day instead of the once a year or so dentist appointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flossaction brush head is my favorite, as it cleans in between your teeth as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love all electronic gadgets and this thing is that and so much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it, NOW!</li>
    <li> Too many times I&#x27;ve watched commercials for toothbrushes and wondered how many times we can reinvent the wheel.  They come with raised bristles, uneven bristles, tongue cleaners, cheek cleaners, ergonomic handles, smart bristles....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can forget them all.  The Oral-B Triumph Professional Care -- and sonic dental care in general -- is the next generation of dental care.  As someone who&#x27;s had far too familiar a relationship with my dentist, I finally took the plunge and made an investment in my teeth.  If you&#x27;re like me, wondering just how much better an expensive gadget like this is than a $3 toothbrush, let me assure you you&#x27;ll know the answer the first time you use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you get used to the skull rattling (and it does go away after the first couple uses), you&#x27;ll actually enjoy the feel of the powerful brush head against your teeth and gums.  The depth of the cleaning is immediately noticeable and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B comes with both a floss action brush head for every day cleaning and a polishing head for occasional polishing.  The settings on the brush are diverse, allowing for firm, soft or massaging pressure depending on your preference.  You can also set the brush to remind you to move on to another areas of your teeth every 30 seconds so you get a thorough, even clean.  The display keeps track of battery life and the whole unit fits nicely into the compact base or the included travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like buying $100 shoes when I can pick up a pair for $20.  I didn&#x27;t think I could ever spend $100 on a toothbrush when my grocery store sells standard models for a couple bucks.  But the older I get the more I realize you generally get what you pay for.  If you&#x27;re like me and wouldn&#x27;t mind if you never saw that big needle or heard that whining drill again, make the investment on the front side by getting the Oral-B.  It really will help you avoid the back-end dental bills.</li>
    <li> We used to use the Oral B rotary toothbrushes, but after brushing the first time with this, we realized the amazing difference in thoroughness with cleaning.  I especially like the polisher head that comes with it - it really removes all the rough spots that tend to accumulate with time on the surface of the teeth that toothbrushes don&#x27;t seem to completely remove.  Try it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have no idea if a lesser model would be as good. I love this thing. Why didn&#x27;t all our friends tell us how great it was to get an electric toothbrush. I want to shout at every dentist I do marketing for - hey why didn&#x27;t you tell me how great electric toothbrushes are. The 2 minute timer, the cleaner mouth, the noticable whiter teeth, all the brush heads - hello we love this thing.    And if you are considering an electric toothbrush for the first time, ask yourself if keeping your teeth - your own teeth for life is worth $50-$135? And just try to get your manual toothbrush to oscilate and turn and manuever like these.</li>
    <li> Very Powerful. Teeth never felt cleaner, did not come with whitening brush head.  Features are great, turns down if you are pushing to hard, gives notice when time to stop brushing.</li>
    <li> At my last cleaning, my dentist recommended that I get and use the Oral-B Triumph, so I did.  I used the Triumph every day for the last 6 months.  I just had my six month cleaning and the results were 100% positive.  Significantly better dental health and the cleaning took half the normal time because my teeth were much cleaner using the Triumph.  The results make the cost of the Triumph well worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush instead of the Sonicare because I have not found the Sonicare to be the best at removing plaque.  Sonicare is very good at splashing toothpaste and saliva as one negotiates the vibrating brush around the mouth as one leaves the mouth slightly open to move the brush into new positions.  I had to wear a towel, otherwise all of my shirts looked like I had bleach stains on them!  The Oral B brush arrived in a box, in which something heavy inside moved around.  Uh OH, I thought.  And it was so.  The packaging protection was non-existent.  The toothbrush box was placed inside a bigger box, which allowed it to move from one end of the outside box to the other every time the angle would change.  Well....some damage was apparent.  The vibrating metal stem took some shocks and pieces were cracked or scarred.  So I emailed the vendor.  He was very cool: Dan Bellino,Sales Manager,Direct Websites/ DAB Nutrition  Hello Dan!  He was extremely supportive, not requiring proof, or accusing me of constructing stories.  Now the toothbrush did work with some action, but I had no idea of the long term effect of the vibration experience the toothbrush had in getting to me, or how it would effect the life of the toothbrush.    I was shipped a new toothbrush in short order, with a pre-paid return label for the damaged one.   Therefore as far as experiencing damaged shipment and receiving excellent handling and treatment, I wish to thank Dan for his effort and help.  Now as to the toothbrush itself.  I have read here on this website that some people think it is noisy.  I consider it not terribly noisy, but I do have clean shirts after I brush my teeth.  I have had it only a month, but battery charging is not rocket science.  These batteries have memory, so I recommend at least once a month just unplugging the charger and let the tooth brush battery get low.  The LCD display is not visible while brushing, it is true, but I don&#x27;t worry about features that don&#x27;t get inthe way, as unfortunately it  is with Microsoft products.  I do experience cleaner teeth, that is an emotional judgement based upon my tongue and sensations in my mouth.  Time will tell all when I visit my dentist in three months!      In summary, the toothbrush works as it is advertised to work, as I have experienced for about a month. Long term experience I cannot evaluate.  Many people are concerned about the cost.  My answer to this is that electric toothbrushes of any kind are a far better alternative than hand held toothbrushes, and this translates into teeth that last a lot longer.  Investing $100 in teeth is nothing compared to the other bills sucking at my income, including the dental fees. I have a toothless 90 year old father to observe, and I \\&quot;hope\\&quot; my efforts will leave me with teeth when I am his age thirty years from now, so I don&#x27;t have to eat mashed potatoes all of the time.</li>
    <li> a very fine product.  I have used the Oral -B for over ten years</li>
    <li> It´s a great product! I bought it 20 days ago and I am happy with...I am in Colombia and I don´t understand a lot English, but I liked a lot this product, it works very well and its performance is nice! I recommend it to everybody! The best electric toothbrush I have used in my life!</li>
    <li> I would recommend it to anyone, using this toothbrush almost feels like going to the dentist.</li>
    <li> Great electrical TB. My whole family is using it. The timer with smiley face is great for the kids. It motivate them to brush the 2 minutes. The dentist said the kids got cleaner teeth. I feel that my tooth is getting really clean and smooth even between brushes.</li>
    <li> My very nice dentist gave me a Christmas present - this toothbrush.  I really liked my Sonicare and I am reluctant to say it, but this brush it better. My teeth are cleaner. And it really knocks down the tartar buildup.   The Sonicare would turn off after two minutes. Sure, it was easy to turn back on. But this brush doesn&#x27;t shut off so I have a tendency to brush longer. And the FlossAction brush head is really great.  If you don&#x27;t have a generous dentist like I do, spend your money on this toothbrush. It is excellent.</li>
    <li> I mostly like this model, I&#x27;ve used an older model for years, but it wasn&#x27;t holding a charge anymore and that&#x27;s why I needed a new one.  This one has too much power.  I have to put it on gentle mode or it feels like it&#x27;s going to knock my teeth out!  Other than that, I do like it.  I like the 30 sec warning for brushing each quadrant of you teeth.  It makes the two minutes seem to go by much faster.  With my old brush, it only warned at the two minute mark and it seemed like \\&quot;forever\\&quot; so I rarely brushed that long.  I also like the feature of different brushes you can use.  Currently I&#x27;m using the flosser &amp; the polisher.  I&#x27;m thinking if I get the regular brush (w/out all the fancy stuff on it) I might be able to use it at full power, as that brush is softer on your teeth.  I would recommend this to anyone &amp; everyone.  My teeth are actually appearing whiter (w/out using whiteners).</li>
    <li> Makes brushing your teeth fun! My mouth and teeth feel cleaner than when using my regular toothbrush.  The toothbrush is timed in 30 sec. intervals to let you know when to move the brush to the next quadrant of your mouth.  You get a Smiley Face in the display after your 2 min. brushing!</li>
    <li> This product is great. We have a head for each person. You won&#x27;t go back to a regular brush.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans all of my teeth individually. The timer on the brush tells me when I have brushed for the recommended time. The brush heads have coloring on them that changes to tell me when it&#x27;s time to change them and get new ones. The lower button on the brush allows me to change the way the brush pulsates while it is in my mouth brushing my teeth too. Ultimately, I just didn&#x27;t think I could cause the bristles on the brush to come in contact with my teeth as many times manually as the Oral-B could. My teeth look great and my gums are healthy and don&#x27;t hurt or bleed. A fully charged brush will stay charged for me for a week of vacation (5 days) brushing 2 (twice daily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck with yours!  Let me know what your dentist says after you use it!!!!</li>
    <li> My wife and I have had these brushes for more than 5 years--use them daily and they still charge as though they were new.  Our dentist said they are far and away better than any others on the market.  He makes this comparison by comparing the types of electric brushes his patients use and the condition of their teeth.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush.  I love the charger that you just set it into.  The two minute timed tooth brushing is great too.  Overall I really have nothing bad to say about this thing.  Its great!  I would recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> I started using this toothbrush with a soft brush. It was recommended to my wife by her dentist and her results convinced me to get my own. It&#x27;s worked great for a few years now and I like the Oral-B style brushes that remind me when it&#x27;s time to change them.</li>
    <li> I get amazingly great results at the dentist using this power toothbrush. I did a ton of research before selecting this brush and found everything to be true. if anything happens to this I will be crushed.</li>
    <li> I just got this brush today and it is great.  They offfered a 30 day money back guarantee on the box so I figured...what could it hurt.    My teeth feel like I just got back from the dentist.    The brush stutters every 30 seconds to tell you to move to the next quadrant and does an extra long stutter when you are done with 2 minutes.    It is just SUPERB.    1/24/6: Well, I have had it for a few months and I still LOVE my toothbrush.  Just wanted to let you know.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush delivers! The visible record of brushing time is especially good.  I really like the choices of brushing techniques. Wish it could play Ode to Joy after 2 minutes.</li>
    <li> this brush cleans and brightens better than other Oral-B brushes I had before</li>
    <li> I had been using the Crest Spin Brush before breaking down and spending the money on this. My dad recommended it saying not only did he love how clean his teeth felt but his dentist had noticed a difference too. My job has me overseas for months to years at times and seeing a dentist can be quite difficult, so I decided to take Dad&#x27;s advice and boy was he right. This toothbrush is amazing! It&#x27;s like getting a professional cleaning every morning and night. I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 weeks now and noticed a difference the first time I used it. I tend to get noticeable plaque buildup between my front bottom teeth and have only been able to get rid of it when the dentist uses the scraper..until now. Just holding the brush there for a few extra seconds has started to chip away the buildup and after two weeks it&#x27;s almost completely gone!!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used the Floss Action brush that came with it. Haven&#x27;t tried the polisher because I&#x27;m not sure if there is special toothpaste to use with it or not. The book it came with isn&#x27;t that clear about it. I&#x27;ve noticed some gum bleeding back where my wisdom teeth were but the instructions say it&#x27;s common at first and that it&#x27;s just toughening them up. It&#x27;s really not a big deal. I haven&#x27;t used the massage or soft features on the brush and probably won&#x27;t but I&#x27;m sure some people might find it useful. Brushing the tongue and roof of your mouth is odd at first but you get use to it, although I&#x27;m not sure yet if I prefer it to a standard brush on these areas.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the description it says the recommended brushing time is 2 minutes and you move every 30 seconds to a new quadrant, but that actually equals 3 minutes (4 if you count your tongue and roof of your mouth). There&#x27;s a diagram in the instructions that explains the areas and how to brush. The pulsing after each 30 sec interval is handy, as you can&#x27;t see the screen when you&#x27;re brushing. One thing that threw me was in the description where it said, \\&quot;the smart plugautomatically adapts to any voltage worldwide\\&quot;, leading me to believe that an adapter was included. It wasn&#x27;t. You have to buy an adapter for it, which I should have figured but wish they would have stated that a bit clearer and possibly even offered a link to one when buying the product. My charging stand is actually in my bedroom hooked up to my transformer waiting for me to find/buy an adapter so I can move it to the bathroom. But if you&#x27;re in the states it&#x27;s not a problem. All in all a great product. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush.  If your going to get one- get the best.  I never had an electric toothbrush before and I have to say that every time I brush- I feel like I just came from the dentist.  Before using this- some days- depending on what I ate or drank- i would just feel like I had this plaque on the back of my teeth that I just couldnt get off.  They should name this thing the plaque blaster!  I no longer have that nitty gritty surface on my teet after brusing.  Its amazing that it recognizes the different brush styles when you change them.  Definately a good product, I have not had one issue or regret with it.  I thought I would completely eliminate the old skool toothrbrush from my bathroom- the truth is- I still use it to brush my tongue. &lt;br /&gt;Hah!</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush after reading all the positive reviews, and am really glad I did! As a long-time Oral-B customer -- I previously used one of their inexpensive power brushes -- stepping up to one much more expensive wasn&#x27;t something I was ready to do without some investigation. But I&#x27;m glad I took that step, because this model is far superior to the one I had before, and well worth its cost.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve yet to test out the length of time this will last between rechargings, but I&#x27;m pleased with the performance and quality of this product.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in plaque build up. I don&#x27;t have any after using the Oral B Trimuph. I highly recommend it. My son and his girlfriend each bought one after my rave review.</li>
    <li> I have never purchased an electric toothbrush before but did so on the advice of my dentist. I have sensitive teeth and receding gums so I was somewhat concerned that this type of toothbrush might aggravate the problem but the opposite has been true. It is like having your teeth professional cleaned daily. This is one purchase I will replace immediately if necessary.</li>
    <li> this is seriously a great toothbrush. i reviewed a whole bunch of electronic toothbrushes to see which one stood out above the others. and this one claimed to be the best. i was so excited to get it and when i used it, it definitely lived up to its expectations. your teeth feel soo clean after using it, like you just came back from the dentist! the best part abt this toothbrush, aside from the cool timer and different settings, is the holder. i know, sounds pointless, but i like the fact that it can hold multiple brushes right there in the stand and has a cover to close it. im some what of a germ-a-phobe when it comes to toothbrushes being near other toothbrushes, so this is great! haha. and it&#x27;s got a nifty lil travel case too. what more could u ask for ;o)</li>
    <li> This power toothbrush cleans my teeth more thoroughly than I could with a manual toothbrush.  It even helps to prevent gum damage due to brushing too aggressively (since it warns you if you are pressing to hard.)  If you can afford it, then this brush might save you from a toothache, cavities, and gum disease.  Which, I guess, makes it apotropiatric.  For replacement brush heads, I recommend the FlossAction variety.  [i.e., \\&quot;Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count)\\&quot;.]</li>
    <li> And so do my teeth. My hygienist has given me good marks even when I&#x27;ve been late on getting my teeth professionally cleaned! In the past, I&#x27;ve tried the Sonicare but found the toothbrush sort of big and clumsy (I gather that they have corrected this problem -- but I&#x27;m a devoted Oral B fan so ..............).</li>
    <li> If you started with Battery operated 5.99 Toothbrushes ,this is  the way to go .  I found this Toothbrush to be highly effective on ridding your mouth of bleeding gums, I use  Metadent toothpaste.     The 9400 works great , Get The dentist clean mouth feeling.      Very good design and engineering ,easy to use and Quiet.    I also recommend ordering additional brush heads, they are  designed  to give you 3 months,  inspect  the wear indicator on the head.</li>
    <li> I have had this for two years now. It is an excellent toothbrush. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the battery. I  wish it was a lithium battery instead of Ni-mh. It will hold a charge for about 2 weeks initially, but after a year or two that time drops to a few days. I just starting keeping mine plugged in all the time. Does an EXCELLENT job cleaning.</li>
    <li> Wow.  Did I say wow?  WOW.  I am a 48-year old hard core bachelor.  Which means I do not always make my bed and usually only brush my teeth once a day, in a hurried fashion.    Out of curiousity I recently purchased a $5 agitating toothbrush at the local supermarket....A noticeable improvement from a regular brush.    So, I sprung for this version as the price was 50% off retail (and, I noticed the price just went down again...).    I can hardly wait to brush my teeth (3x a day).  In just two days I can tell my gums are in much better shape and my teeth look like just after a $350 dentist cleaning.  Hence the title to my review.  I feel empowered that I do not have to subsidize those art deco dental offices with their over-charging for basic services.  This should keep me out of the dentist office for a long time.  :)  Hip, hip, hooray!</li>
    <li> The brush works very well. My whole family is happy with it.  I bought two sets for the family.  Each has been working just fine for the past month. Also, the brush heads are designed so that it reaches the rear teeth more effectively. I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Leaves my teeth feeling really clean and my teeth super white. The timer is great. It reminds me to move along since I tend to brush too hard and too long. GREAT PRICE!!! I compared multiple sites and stores and this was the cheapest.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush.  While it is an upgrade from my previous Oral-B toothbrush, this one does it all and does it well.</li>
    <li> This is the cream of crop for an electric tooth brush.  I have purchased 4 other Oral- B  electric tooth brushes/ I have sensitive teeth and there is a setting for my sensitive teeth and also for polishing my teach with special Crest Weekly Clean.  This process makes my teeth feel like I have just had my teeth polished at the dentist.  I love to have smooth and white teeth.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these,this month, one for myself and one for my \\&quot;domestic partner\\&quot; (she thinks she&#x27;s my \\&quot;girlfriend\\&quot;), separately, one for $65.99 and the next for about $75.00, through Amazon. I see the price is skyrocketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a great decision, as it turned out - it caused me to put my Rota-Dent electric toothbrush \\&quot;in mothballs\\&quot; along with manual toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My not-too-bright DP put toothpaste on the brushhead and turned it on BEFORE touching the brush to her teeth and wondered why there was toothpaste all over the bathroom. DUH ! That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t consider her to be my girlfriend - too much sawdust instead of brains. But she is pretty and has a great asset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Very powerful machine you&#x27;ll love to use - may become addictive.&lt;br /&gt;Shop carefully for best price, including S+H, on replacement brusheads, including Pro-White polishing brusheads. Makes a great gift BTW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it ![[ASIN:B000LDQ2Z8 Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush]]</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is loud, slow and the round brush head is not as effective as the regular oblong brush. Wish I could return it. The twenty-dollar toothbrush you find in any drugstore is much superior to this brush with bells and whistles and little else...</li>
    <li> I never knew what I was missing out on.  The first time I used it, I immediately noticed a difference in how clean my teeth felt.  The bottom line is, it just works better than doing it manually.  The only turnoff was all the little extras that I figured would be in some way helpful.  For instance, the LCD screen; you can&#x27;t read it while you are brushing and the only worthwhile information presented is the time you&#x27;ve brushed for.  Most electric toothbrushes will let you know when you reach 30 second intervals anyway, so I don&#x27;t really see the point.  The different brush modes are nice, but not necessary (and I wonder if they actually do anything more than the standard \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode).  All in all, the purchase was well worth it and highly recommended.  For anyone on the fence, save some money and buy a cheaper model with less extras.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this toothbrush after using a Sonicare Elite for about the past 5 years.    This is an excellent toothbrush and well worth the money. The $64,000 question for me was does it clean my teeth as well or better than the Sonicare and to that I say a resounding YES.    Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the Sonicare Elite is an excellent toothbrush and there are many things I loved about it from the balanced handle and thumb rest to the nicely tapered head and thin shaft that make it easy to maneuver around to get to all your teeth, particularly the back teeth.    However, I now realize that in comparison, it was not cleaning my teeth as well as the Oral-B. That comes down to the different methods each brush uses to clean the teeth. The Sonicare uses as simple up-and-down action along with the sonic action to clean the surface of the teeth and force the toothpaste into the spaces between the teeth. The Oral-B uses a dual-motion head that consist of a rotating inner brush and  an oscillating outer brush. The inner brush cleans the surface, while the outer flossing brush gets in between the teeth to give a more thorough cleaning.    There are some quirks with the Oral-B that I am getting used to that could be improved or modified. For example, both the Sonicare and Oral-B have a 30 second timer over 2 minutes to remind you to switch quadrants that you are brushing. The Sonicare approach is to momentarily pause the brushing when 30 secs. are reached. The Oral-B uses a mechanical stuttering at the 30 sec. mark. The Sonicare will automatically shut off after 2 minutes of brushing are reached. The Oral-B will engage a longer stutter, but will continue to brush and reset the timer to another 2  minutes and will display a smiley face on the handle&#x27;s LCD display that 2 minutes are reached. Unfortunately, the LCD info panel placement on the handle makes it virtually impossible to see during brushing.    Another quirk is the \\&quot;pressure sensitivity\\&quot; feature of the Oral-B. If the brush detects you are pressing too hard on the teeth, it briefly stutters. However, the difference between this stutter and the 30 sec. timer stutter is very subtle making it difficult to know if the stutter was the timer or the pressure sensitivity being engaged. A far better method would be to either beep or pause momentarily until normal pressure is resumed rather than the stuttering, that can be easily confused as the timer.    Also, the Oral-B has 3 cleaning modes - normal, sensitive teeth and polishing. For first time users or coming from a manual toothbrush, I would recommend starting on the sensitive mode. The scrubbing action of the normal mode is very intense and may provoke some gum bleeding so it&#x27;s probably wise to use the sensitive mode to start and then after a week or 2 begin using the normal mode.    Lastly, the Oral-B is a heavier toothbrush than the Sonicare. I does feel very solid in your hand, but it is several ounces heavier than a Sonicare. Most of the weight is in the handle, making the the Oral-B feel a little less balanced than the Sonicare, which has a very nice balance and fits a bit more comfortably in your hand.    All said, the Oral-B Triumph is an excellent toothbrush that does an outstanding job of cleaning your teeth, especially the very difficult intra-tooth areas that other brushes just can&#x27;t reach.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Comes with all accessories one will ever need. It lasted 7 years and after all this time only the battery died. It was used by two people daily so quite a good performance from a battery.</li>
    <li> This highly touted, expensive electric toothbrush was OK while it lasted.  Guarantee is for 2 years, &amp; it stops working in the 3rd year. I have had longer lasting disposable electric brushes.  Will never buy another one.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe the Sonic Care hyppe. I got this brush and cleans my teeth and molars esp well. The timer is the best part- allows you to brush for a full 2 min which seems like an eternity at first- hah</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush! I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 4 years and it still works well, although the battery needs more frequent charging now. Other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> The most awesome tooth brush ever.  I suffered sensitive teeth and gums for many years. After multiple gum grafts and using sensitive toothpaste with the Panasonic toothbrush I was still in a loosing battle with sensitivity an gum regression.  Three years ago I purchased my first Oral-B Triumph.  I brush extra longer than necessary curving around each tooth and gum area.  Relief from sensitivity and my gums are holding their place.  I have even gotten so lazy brushing once a day at night and my periodontitis says things are looking better than ever.  The battery went dead after two years but I was able to replace it for $20 and found the instructions on You Tube and now it runs like new again.</li>
    <li> This model is not a water proof toothbrush, water will leak through the power button and stop working.&lt;br /&gt;stay away from this model.</li>
    <li> Never worked as expected. I am looking for another one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this rechargeable toothbrush daily ever since I purchased it and would not replace it with any other rechargeable toothbrush.  It is excellent.  I only have to recharge it every two weeks.  It does an excellent job of cleaning my teeth and even my dental checkups are better.  My dentist recommended I get it and I have never been sorry.  When I travel, I take it along with the small, recharger piece which is connected to the cord and plug.  It came with a small carrying case also.</li>
