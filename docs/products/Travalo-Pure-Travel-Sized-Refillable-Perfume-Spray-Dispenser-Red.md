<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Always wanted to carry my fav perfume with me. Lets face it perfume does not last all day. It was as easy as can be just insert the bottom of vial into your perfume bottle with spray nozzle off keep pumping until filled. Loved the see through vial so you can tell how much you have filled. My vial was delivered quickly in perfect condition. No leaking whatsoever. Now I have a small vial of perfume to easily fit into my bag.  No more worries about not having a spray of heaven when needed. I wear Tom  Ford Neroli Portofino just love the ocean breezes and scents of tropical sunsets and sandunes.</li>
    <li> I love to carry these in my makeup bag....they do not leak and are so convenient to use. I would recommend this to anyone instead of buying those expensive smaller bottles of perfume!!</li>
    <li> Amazon Vine Review. When I go for a night out I take tiny perfume sample bottles, but when travelling these are just too delicate to survive in my luggage (especially how baggage handlers throw it about)...thus I use this product. It&#x27;s a good size, a bit bulkier than the sample bottles I normally pop in my little handbags for going out, but it&#x27;s perfect for my day-to-day bag and my luggage. I&#x27;m impressed by how much perfume this product holds too, plenty to last me over a two week trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really easy to get the perfume into the bottle - it&#x27;s works a little like a refillable cigarette lighter, just take the top off your perfume and press the bottom of this product to the top of your perfume bottle. You have to press down every time to a squirt of perfume into this bottle, but the squirts are big enough that it fills up fast, so won&#x27;t hold you up in a hurry. Durability is good, it&#x27;s plastic and sturdy so won&#x27;t break easily if knocked in your bag, rounded bottle also helps avoid damage if knocked while in your bag. I was also a little worried about leakage, but non at all.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT!!! No leaks and real easy to fill.</li>
    <li> LOVE these things! Make taking perfume anywhere possible without the risk of leaking. I made the mistake of taking a whole bottle with me only to have to toss a bunch of stuff because it leaked... Not anymore!!</li>
    <li> very handy. easy to put perfumes in and small enough to take on the go.</li>
    <li> These are great for travel if you have perfume that allows you to get to the stem of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;love it.</li>
    <li> Love this atomizer. It is easy to fill, doesn&#x27;t leak, and holds about a one-month supply of cologne. I carry it in my small makeup bag. Such convenience causes me to use a scent regularly. The shape of my original perfume bottle is round with smooth sides.  It&#x27;s a bit too large to use comfortably, for fear of dropping the glass bottle. This tiny atomizer is a perfect solution.  Two month update: Reduced my rating by one star. Ordered a second one of these because the first was great.  Unfortunately, the second one leaks.  It is a tiny leak, but nonetheless it&#x27;s a leak. Didn&#x27;t discover the problem until traveling so unable to exchange the item.  Suggest you carry the little spray bottle around in your purse or backpack before taking it along on a trip, to make sure it doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;ve improved the leak problem from previous versions. I have 3 of them and travel with multiple scents. Buy one, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift. Wife loves it. Easy to fill and no leaks.</li>
    <li> Good concept, but it does not fit my perfume bottle.</li>
    <li> I use a nice perfume, but the bottle is big and heavy to pack.  I decided to give this a try, even though a few folks said it leaked.  Well, mine is great.  No leaks and I had my fragrance with me on vacation.  It is easy to fill, too.  Just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> I love this so much I bought 12 to give as Gifts.  Easy to fill with your perfume and can be used over and over again.</li>
    <li> This is a nifty solution for traveling with your perfume.  It is really easy to fill as long has your original perfume has a spray delivery system.  Will certainly be useful on vacations.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for travel, easy to fill and nice misty spray.</li>
    <li> Serves its purpose. Needed something plastic to put perfume in and it works great! Good tip- When changing perfumes, clean it out so the scents dont mix.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for one trip and it worked very well. It did not leak and it sprayed well.</li>
    <li> Not sure but it was confusing to fill.  My perfume bottle will not allow me to remove the small spray cap. And it appears you cannot fill the travalo by unscrewing the top.  Should have got the one to use with funnel.  Will be returning.</li>
    <li> Definitely great fro travel. My only gripe is that I notice my cologne is not as pungent as it would be had i sprayed from the original bottle itself.</li>
    <li> This product is so useful. I ordered one as a trial so that I could easily take my favorite scent along on trips with me. It was very easy to fill and so small that it took up hardly any room in my carry-on liquids bag.</li>
    <li> I strongly disliked carrying huge perfume bottles in my bag; trying to carry smaller bags even seemed impossible. The Travalo is about the size of a lipstick, so it does not take up much space and lasted a lot longer than a I thought it would. It is easy to refill: you just take the spray cap off and pump down on the perfume bottle when refiling. The only really con is when you actually spray the Travalo; the outside of the atomizer gets a little wet with perfume after you spray it. It does the job, just not the same as the spray from a perfume bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the product and I would recommend purchasing it or buying it as a gift for someone. Travalo comes in several cute colors, so you do not have to stick with black or silver; black might be best if you plan to purchase it as a gift for a guy. Also, if you have more than one perfume it helps to have different colors so you know which one is which.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0058W17UM Travalo Travel Sized Refillable Perfume Spray Dispenser (Red)]], [[ASIN:B005BQLXWM Travalo Travel Sized Refillable Perfume Spray Dispenser (Gold)]], [[ASIN:B005BQLF7K Travalo Pure BLACK]], [[ASIN:B0058W05IM Travalo Pure Silver]], [[ASIN:B005BQKX8M Travalo Pure PINK]]</li>
    <li> Works well for traveling. Convenient to carry in a purse. I bit small but can last up to a week if perfume is used sparingly.</li>
    <li> Easy to fill and works surprisingly well.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it is easy to fill and I can put it in my wallet since I don&#x27;t use large purses often.</li>
    <li> Easy to fill.  Nice size.  However, it does leak!!</li>
    <li> Only limitation is that some perfume nozzles may be too large for it. I had one bottle for which that was the case. Otherwise,  works exactly as advertised and no leaks in everyday use.</li>
    <li> this is a great product ....  but... did not work for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;she really wanted this product and saw that so many others go it to work but she could not.&lt;br /&gt;we thought that maybe her Canadian perfume she gets at one store is different that all the others. guessing not but do not know what other it could be .&lt;br /&gt;did not want to try mine USA men&#x27;s stuff cause we wanted to return it if she could not get it working.&lt;br /&gt;She tried for two days and could not get it working so we sent it back&lt;br /&gt;but&lt;br /&gt;i gets 4 stars as this is a great idea and so many others love it and make it work</li>
    <li> This worked perfectly, and it did not leak in my bag:)  I truly appreciated having it on vacation with me!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It gives me chance to use my favorite perfume on the go. Plus, I can mix any perfumes in this dispenser and create any new combination.  I bought the third one for myself. Probably, I will buy as a gift for my friends.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as described. Perfect for travel and for carrying in your purse. Easy to use. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Easy to fill, portable and good quality. Already ordered two more!!! Needless to say, will keep purchasing as needed and make for great gifts!</li>
    <li> i put my favorite cologne in here . i wont leak , perfect for your car, i got red because it was the only manlyish color.</li>
    <li> No spills or anything of leaking</li>
    <li> I was tired of carrying around my large perfume bottle in my purse.  Found this refillable dispenser and LOVE IT!  Have told everyone I know about it.  You won&#x27;t regret buying it...I promise.</li>
    <li> It has the perfect size!! Great for traveling and taking arround on a purse, even on the smallest one! The perfume never licked of the bottle. Does the job really well!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic!! I received 5 days earlier than suspected date. I live all the way in Hawaii so I&#x27;m surprised I got it so fast. I love that it&#x27;s pocket sized so I could take it everywhere! I use to have those 99¢ spray bottles from Walmart but I had to constantly keep spraying my perfume into the bottle just so I don&#x27;t have to keep carrying that big thing. This is perfect for me! So far it hasn&#x27;t leaked (I&#x27;ve seen reviews that people had a hard time with these) but otherwise I definitely recommend to everyone who travels and especially girls on the go</li>
    <li> Easy to fill, great to have in your purse or travel bag.  Doesn&#x27;t leak at all.</li>
    <li> It is a great product to store fragrance for travel, but it does leak a little bit, so the fragrance is spent faster.</li>
    <li> Got the red one for my wife. Very reliable product. No leakage on plane.</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life!! No more hunting for deals on the travel size of my favorite perfume! I can now just refill this compact sprayer over and over again!  I ordered the black one for my husband to keep one at the office and one in his travel bag and the pretty silver, gold and red ones for all my girlfriends!  Great idea!  Thanks Travalo!!</li>
    <li> After a year of having this I find I rarely use it because this actually leaks your perfume out quite quickly so it evaporates and then you have none. yes its good for travel but not for long term just sitting in your bag.  I have become quite disenchanted with it.  Just use for a single trip, a few squirts and then use it quickly.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for traveling with perfume, be on a trip or just keeping in your purse. I have never found perfume wands to be that effective and carrying around a bottle can be disaster. With this dispenser, you can always have your favorite perfume with you. I will admit I got mine along with my mother at a perfume shop. I got this one for her secretary who had to have one after seeing my mothers. She loves it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And my mother figured out this dispenser is able to get that last little bit of perfume out of the bottle that is not enough for the sprayer to get, so you also don&#x27;t have to toss a bottle out with perfume left in it.</li>
    <li> Do not travel without it. It is such a useful and compact accessory. Very easy to add perfume, no mess, no spilling. I have bought a bunch of these for myself (for purse, gym bag, etc) and for my friends as gifts.</li>
    <li> the idea is great and the product is nice but the only problem is that is leaks, i don&#x27;t know if all of them does or just mine was defected</li>
    <li> I love this product easy to fill. Loved it so much bought one for each of my sisters. Only thing I wish the spray part matched the color of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I love these. I have one for all of my favorite perfumes, I love having a variety of different perfumes with me at all times. Also good for travel.</li>
    <li> Planning to buy this again for a couple of female family and friends! Love it! So convinient to carry in your purse.</li>
    <li> This was for my granddaughter who saw it on TV. She loved it, but it was over priced. With the shipping added in I could have purchased it on another site, and had three of them. I hope it works.</li>
    <li> Received this a week ago to take on a trip  this week. Experimenting with taking a carry-on only (no checked luggage) and realized that my regular perfume bottle is more than the allowed 3 ounces. Received item quickly, directions on the box were clear and the bottle filled easily with my perfume....no mess, no spill, no waste. I am currently using it while on my trip (used for 2 days, approx 6 squirts) and I can see the amount in the bottle go down. Hope it lasts til I get back home!  Love the product though, worked just as it was suppose to...very easy to fill.</li>
    <li> Great and easy to use!!!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love these handy, dandy travel fragrance vials. With the amount of traveling I do, for work as well as pleasure, these allow me to take along all my favorites. The product line I wear is customizable and designed for layering, so these are the perfect item to bring them together for a long vacation or short business trip. As bonus points, I get to take my favorites with no risk of broken glass, and no significant added luggage weight! Great for cosmetic bag/purse for daily use too!! I have three of them, and I&#x27;m positive I don&#x27;t have enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow Up: A potential buyer asked if they were plastic; Yes, they are plastic; there is no smell and no effect to the fragrance. You can use these with great confidence.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the perfume I have recently starting wearing doesn&#x27;t come in small, travel-size bottles.  I searched EBay and Amazon, and was tempted to buy samples of the perfume to keep in my purse.  Then I stumbled onto this product and it is the most wonderful invention.  It&#x27;s easy and quick to use by removing the spray cap of your perfume bottle and inserting the bottom of the Travalo onto the mechanism.  Just pump and the little bottle fills like magic. The hardest part will be removing the top spray portion of your perfume bottle! Now I can smell pretty whether I remember to spritz myself in the morning or not!</li>
    <li> This is perfect size to take my perfume on business trips!  It did take me a bit to figure out how to fill but it&#x27;s easy once I did.</li>
    <li> Easy to fill, no leaking as of yet. I ordered another one!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these and one set of very inexpensive ones.  The other set is http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BPUAUB8/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a lot more expensive but they are made of glass and very nice looking also.  It works with perfume bottles that you can take the cap off so you place this on top of the regular perfume bottle spraying tube and with pumping action, the perfume goes up into this small bottle.  For example, for my bottle of Calvin Klein Eternity, it does not work with this little bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I filled one up and it&#x27;s been sitting in my purse for oh probably a few months now.  The last time I took it out, about 1/5 has disappeared.  For my  purpose of having a travel size perfume, I&#x27;d stick with the other ones I bought as mentioned above.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly easy to fill. Great for the purse</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve purchased... for another favorite perfume.  I love these dispensers.  They do not leak and are very easy to fill.  The spray is a perfect spritz of your favorite scent.  What an amazing product this is!</li>
    <li> I have been looking on and off for years for the ideal travel sized perfume container and finally found it.  This works by removing the spray head from the perfume bottle and pushing the bottom of this bottle on the exposed stem of the perfume bottle.  You press down and repeat until the container fills.  No spillage, no waste while filling and no evaporation like previous travel size bottles.  I was so pleased I got another one to keep in my purse.</li>
    <li> I can take my favorite perfume when I travel, and I love it.  So easy to fill up, and fits right in my toiletries bag, I don&#x27;t like checking in my bag, so this is perfect.</li>
    <li> The pump on a favorite bottle of perfume started acting up recently, spraying like a jet instead of a mist. This travel dispenser was super easy to fill, and sprays a nice fine mist.  I havent traveled with it, but will for sure. It says it can hold about 60 sprays, and that seems about right from what ive seen.  Ive had no problems with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it only for few weeks now, until now no leaksssss :) design its nice, plastic its good to keep inside the purse.</li>
    <li> Love love love. I want more</li>
    <li> Works great! and just right size to carry in my purse. Would make a great gift for all my friends.</li>
    <li> You will not be sorry you bought this.&lt;br /&gt;it is as easy to work as it says! Now I can carry my favorite perfume around in my purse. I got two and will probably be getting more as gifts!</li>
