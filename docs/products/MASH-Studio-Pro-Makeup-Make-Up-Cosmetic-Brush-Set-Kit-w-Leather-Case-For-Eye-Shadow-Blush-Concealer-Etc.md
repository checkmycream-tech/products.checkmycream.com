<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this and the brushes are fantastic. They are the best brushes that I could have bought for the price.</li>
    <li> item is amazing, shipping was prompt and satisfactory. only complaint is that i would like to know the name/type of brush of each piece and/or some description of what this particular brush does or is meant to be best used for. there are so many brushes included (which is a good thing, don&#x27;t get me wrong) but some of them are very similar to each other and i wish there was a way to tell them apart, to know how they are different from each other so i know how to use all of them and benefit more from this amazing brush set. i have tried looking at other websites descriptions of different makeup brushes in order to identify what each of these ones but have found this method to be very tedious guess-work and am still unsure of how to use many of the brushes. because of this i feel i am only getting half of the use out of the kit.     but aside from the aforementioned issue i am extremely happy with the kit and my purchase from the seller.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying these brushes are great quality for their price! I&#x27;ve had brushes that were much more money but were very flimsy. These brushes were shipped fast and in good condition. I have used them a couple times and I am pleased. Only two complaints are the fact that they&#x27;re not labeled and there really is no blending brush witch is very important. But you eventually learn the brushes and a blending brush is very cheap to buy. So it&#x27;s an all around pretty dang good product.</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes. A lot of brushes for the price. I have had them for about a month or so and have used them everyday. I wash the ones I use every day to every other day and they are holding up well. No fraying or bristles falling out. I do wish they were numbered, but I can still tell what most are used for. Would be great for anyone starting off in makeup, or for those wanting to add brushes to thier existing collection.</li>
    <li> This brush set has so many brushes and they seem to be of good quality. If you got this brush set, you would never need another type brush - ever!  It has everything and the pouch rolls up and ties. It&#x27;s very compact and I think you would be very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my niece, Seems like these were good, she is happy with it. although the package could be better...</li>
    <li> This set is awesome for the price!  SO. MANY. BRUSHES.  More than I think I&#x27;ll ever need, but I have &#x27;em just in case.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with the brush set as well as for the price I paid it for. The leather case makes it look so professional and fancy. The smell that everyone complains about is really tolerable,it goes away after awhile. I have not used all of the brushes yet,but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll make use of them one day. A must have product for make up craze like me.</li>
    <li> Great price, great product, great service. Exactly what i wanted. A good variety of decent quality brushes. Love that the have a case too helps to stay organized.</li>
    <li> My daughter is an Esthetician and she bought these to try for her own use.  She says the larger makeup brushes are okay and that the smaller brushes are good.</li>
    <li> Bought the brushes for my daughter and she loves them!  She is a teenager just learning how to put her makeup on and I wanted her to have the right tools.   There is every brush needed.</li>
    <li> this product was a christmas gift and my grandaughter loved it.[[ASIN:B003HLTTJM 34pc Studio Pro Makeup Make Up Cosmetic Brush Set Kit w/ Leather Case - For Eye Shadow, Blush, Concealer, Etc.]]</li>
    <li> Cheap brushes that fell apart quickly. The case is nice but I ended up using most of the brushes for face painting.&lt;br /&gt;if serious about make up, dont bother</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my 16 year old, and she loves it. What came was exactly what is pictured. As others have said, it did stink pretty bad when it arrived, but I just unwrapped each brush and left the case open for a day and the smell was completely gone. The brushes are soft, and there are several duplicates of many of the brushes which is nice for different makeup schemes. The carrying case is very convenient. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I felt the amazingly soft brushes  I am very happy with this particular set of brushes, I am very satisfied with the quality of the bristles and with the quantity of the set. I have shown several friends and have recommended the brush set to them.</li>
    <li> I needed brushes desperately, but didn&#x27;t want to pay $10 per brush at Sephora. I bought this hoping it would work, and it really did. When I opened it, the case had a bit of a smell to it (not a bad smell, just almost like a stale smell), but after literally about 5 minutes airing out, the smell was completely gone. It has plenty of brushes for every makeup need. It&#x27;s a great product and comes in an awesome case.</li>
    <li> good quality, fairly priced</li>
    <li> These brushes are VERY POOR QUALITY, like dollar store or for children. The bristles on the brushes are very harsh, very Badly shaped (I had to cut some with scissors), the wooden handles are super loose, no fluffy brushes almost all are flat the face brushes are unusable. There are only maybe 3 brushes I can actually use and still don&#x27;t because they don&#x27;t apply the makeup where I want it and I get hair all over my face. This was by far my worst purchase on amazon. Please do not be deceived by the other reviews I am a cosmetic consultant/artist I honestly just suggest to go buy brushes at any of the cosmetics retailers!! Ps the case to hold the brushes is a very cheap fake leather the cords on mine ripped on on day two.</li>
    <li> I was afraid to purchase this due to the comments regarding the smell of the bag. The smell was not bad at all. Do not let this prevent you from purchasing these brushes. The number of brushes were overwhelming the quality is good and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I also ordered a second set for my 12 year old daughter.  I do agree that it is ashame that there is nothing stating what each brush does. But that really doesn&#x27;t matter trial and error will tell me which brush is good for what purpose.  It would of been nice though if there were instructions as to what each brush does.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase. All brushes are great quality and arrived on time. Only negative is that the bigger brushes tend to shed compared the smaller ones. Otherwise great purchase and awesome present!</li>
    <li> excellent quality and superbly presented</li>
    <li> There are so many to choose from! The brushes are great quality and the shipping was extremely speedy. Very impressed!</li>
    <li> the product was amazing! all the brushes i will ever need. beautiful results and amazing shipping! i love my brushes :]</li>
    <li> This brush set is a steal for the price.  The brushes are of good quality and there are so many that I can&#x27;t possibly use them all.  The only complaint that I have is that the brushes aren&#x27;t labeled so I don&#x27;t know what all of them are used for.  I&#x27;m not a professional makeup artist.</li>
    <li> The 34 piece brush set is awesome! I had the brush set for two weeks. I washed and conditioned the brushes before I used them. There was very little shedding maybe 4-7 bristles and I was so surprised, and yet delighted that I bought the brush set.  This is a good set for the price and it comes with a leather case.  The case has a smell but after a week the smell is not as strong.  I am glad I purchased this set and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> For the price, I think its a pretty good deal. However, all of the larger(darker colored) brushes I got shed very very easily and are very scratchy, with the exception of the blending brush, which is wonderful. The lighter brushes are very soft and work well, however there is many of the EXACT same brush, just slightly different size. So in actuality your not getting 34 brushes, because many of them are the same. For the price, its worth it, even though I don&#x27;t use the darker brushes, I use the other ones and they work well. I would recommend getting a better quality set, for just a little more money somewhere else though, even if its not as many brushes.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS A REALLY GOOD DEAL FOR BOTH MAKE UP ARTIST AND ORDINARY GIRLS IT LOOKS JUST LIKE THE PHOTO AND IN GOOD QUALITY</li>
    <li> I used to love this product but it falls apart and there is not a good variety of brushes. I would not recomend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this make up set. There are so many brushes to choose from. The only down fall with this product is that there are so many different brushes, I&#x27;m not really sure what they are used for. Yay for trial and error.</li>
    <li> Shipping was prompt. The item was exactly as described and arrived in good condition. My daughter was thrilled with the quality and the amount of different type of brushes in the set. The picture was a great help in my decision making and so was the description of the type of materials the brushes were made of.</li>
    <li> I must say, I was very pleased with my makeup brushes.  They are good quality brushes for the price. The case is very durable and attractive. I recommend these brushes to anyone who is just starting out as a Makeup artist or just for your own personal use.</li>
    <li> I had bought inexpensive make up brushes before, so I really thought this was a deal.  NOT!!!  I ended up tossing the entire brush set away.  First of all, they smell horrible with some chemical.  The brushes are coarse and you can&#x27;t really use it with hair falling out all over your face.  The bottom line, it&#x27;s not even worth $2dollars, let alone $20</li>
    <li> i probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone because the smaller brushes are brushes used for painting. The larger brushes aren&#x27;t soft, and they shed. I gave all of the brushes to my mom who is an artist and she likes them. They aren&#x27;t good at applying make-up. Save your money to buy some more expensive brushes. This product was a lot of money for the result. I was rather dissapointed.</li>
    <li> This is a great set! I was expecting something really low quality for the price, but was greatly surprised to find how great these brushes are. This set includes a brush for everything I need and a very convenient carrying case. I would definitely buy this product again! If you want a great set of brushes and at a cheap price, this is the set. I had checked out other sites, but I wasn&#x27;t willing to spend so much right now. This set was perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I have bought several sets of makeup brushes over the years from some of the most expensive to very inexpensive. I am very happy with this particular set of brushes. I am in a theatrical make up class on a nearby campus and these will be used for my professional career. I am very satisfied with the quality of the bristles and with the quantity of the set. I have shown several friends and have recommended the brush set to them. If I am looking for a gift to give a make-up \\&quot;junkie\\&quot;, this is the set.     I was also very satisfied with the timely fashion in which they arrived. I ordered them on a Thursday and the following Wednesday they were delivered to my door, just in time for class on Thursday. At the time I ordered them, I wasa given until the first part of February to expect them...very plesantly surprised when they arrived in less than a week.     Thank you,  V</li>
    <li> The brushes in this 34 piece make-up brush kit are of great quality. The price is great for the product you get. I am exceedingly happy with the product!</li>
    <li> Great Brushes for a Great price! The smell is a little overbearing, But what I did was take out all the brushes and clean them, and once they were out and drying I ran the case under water and left it outside to dry out. The smell completely cleared out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to makeup but not to the beauty industry, I&#x27;ve been a licensed stylist for over 7 yrs. I&#x27;ve always wanted to learn how to apply makeup but wasn&#x27;t sure about buying high priced brushes just yet. I spend many nights reading reviews before buying and I&#x27;m pleased for now. Later down the road I will invest in Sigma or MAC brushes but for now they get the job done. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me, it&#x27;s not like I can smell it while applying my makeup.. actually I can&#x27;t smell it at all now and I&#x27;ve had them for almost 3 wks.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great quality and they came in the mail alot faster then I expected. I recommend anyone to get these! Great deal :)</li>
    <li> Lots of brushes! Worth the price!  The only down side is that alot of hair comes off the brushes  but other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Great shipping; it arrived quickly. The case sort of smells when you get it but it&#x27;s fine if you air it for awhile. The brushes are beautiful and plenty. Most of them I know what they are for, you can easily go online and look at sigma brushes or other brushes to figure out what they are used for. They are really soft and nice. The only problem is the ones I got shed, and I&#x27;m not talking about one or two. I&#x27;m talking about bunches at a time; it sheds terribly. I guess that&#x27;s the price of cheap brushes for you. It&#x27;s really hard to find brushes that are cheap and decent.</li>
    <li> The brushes are just fine. There are too many, though, which for a person that, like me, wants to start learning, it is a little overwhelming not to have a manual where it tells you what is what.</li>
    <li> To be completley honest, a few hours after i ordered this set, i was already regreting it.  I was thinking, What if the case smells, how will the brushes work, did i waste my money?!  2 days later, my set arrived.  I was a bit nervous opening the package, because i smelled a funny smell. I took out the kit and it didnt smell to good.  In litterally the next minute, the smell was gone.  I felt the amazingly soft brushes then ran each of them under water, dried them with a paper towel, then put them back in the pouches.  There was absolutly NO dye that had come out!  The little brushes were so so soft, the powder brushes were not completley \\&quot;soft\\&quot; but they worked great and didnt hurt when i used them!  I continued to use them for days, and each day i wa more satisfied with my purchase!  It was $25 for 34 brushes that I will use for ever!  I could not have spent my money on anything better!  I was looking for somthing inexpencive that I could get some use out of.  These brushes are better than the ones being bought for $20-$50 per brush!  This shocked me!  I would definatley recomend these brushes!  I love them sooooo much!  Hope this helps you in your desicion!!!</li>
    <li> I love the variety of brushes and all of my models have told me how good they feel on their faces.</li>
    <li> Brushes came 2days after ordering.  Was really excited! The larger brushes are not sft at all and when cleaning give off a red dye color.  The smaller brushes are pretty decent...was thinking I could have saved my money and purchased sedona lace votex ...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the brushes now for about 2-3 months and I tend to kill my stuff pretty easily.  However, the glue on them has NOT unseated from the brushes yet, and the brushes don&#x27;t really shed.  They&#x27;re also super soft and have no problems being cleaned.  The belt that comes with them is made from a leatherette-type material that&#x27;s easy to clean (wet wipe), though it&#x27;s slightly bulky when it comes to storage, but not ridiculous.  (About 10\\&quot; high when rolled up.)    The only thing I would want out of this is more ANGLED brushes as the ones included are basically round, fluffy tips, with only a few being thin.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes as a gift for my 16 year old daughter.  I was pleased with the quality of the brushes.  She has been very happy with them so far.  I wish the brushes were marked as to what they are to be used for.  Other than that, it is a very nice set!</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay a set of very cheap brushes the plastic case ( they call it leather) smell very bad it gives me a headache i am not happy at all</li>
    <li> ummm the face brushes r horrible, dnt plan top use those.. the rest of the brusehs,i cnt distinguish between lip concealer n eyeshadow, they all the same, kinda regret this . the case even strtd falling apart</li>
    <li> I love the brushes but some of the important brushes are missing in the kit that I thought would be included. It&#x27;s missing 3 which i&#x27;ll buy sepreatly but for all the other brushes it was worth the price. I highly recommend this seller. The package was packed properly so thier is no damage. It was also sent promptly.</li>
    <li> Brushes are great. The only down fall is that i wish there was numbers and also description on what the brushes are ment for. But overall their great brushes! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a set of affordable and quality brushes for a while. But I guess you can only have one of the two. I was hesitant to purchase these at first because it seemed too good to be true. Shipping was really fast and when they came, I was so excited to open it. It looked really good from far until I took them out of the wrappers. The large brushes looked ultra flimsy. The handles looked like they were about to fall apart and the hair was rough and unusable. The smaller brushes were in fact art paint brushes. They started shedding without me evening trying them. So I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m gonna bother with it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to people who are looking for quality brushes. But if you don&#x27;t mind them shedding, go for it. The only reason why I gave this a 3 star is because of the speedy shipping and its literally less than a dollar a brush. Guess you can&#x27;t ask for more when it&#x27;s that cheap.</li>
    <li> My daughter was very happy with these brushes and she is very picky. I am so glad that I found them and very happy that we purchased them. She uses them every day!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews for these brushes. My cheapo Elf brushes are 10x better than these. I&#x27;ve had these for over 3 months so I&#x27;ve given them a fair shake. There are only a couple of really usable brushes, most of the brushes are almost exactly the same, skinny small flat brushes that don&#x27;t pick up makeup well at all. The brushes are so thin and you practically have to dig down into eyeshadow just to the brush will pick any up and even then it picks up very little. Why would someone need so many flat brushes that are almost identical? The few bigger brushes are not at all soft and feel so coarse on my face. The one eyeshadow brush that isn&#x27;t flat doesn&#x27;t do a good job at blending. I guess I can use the roll when I travel but most of the brushes should be used by my niece to paint with since using them for makeup is pointless. The smell when they arrived was horrible, it&#x27;s the roll that smells - the brushes themselves don&#x27;t smell after you wash them. So to sum it all up.. a total waste of money, I would send them back if I could.</li>
    <li> I just this set and it sucks to b honest... The big brushes shed like crazy and they r very rough... And alot of the brushes are exactly the same... I just dont care for it myself</li>
    <li> I had already ordered a set similar to these off of ebay, but they were taking too long to arrive so i thought that these would hold me over. The shipping was fast and itwas packaged nicely. The plastic smell isn&#x27;t over powering, but an annoyance. After you wash your brushes the smell is gone. The face brushes are coarse, and the hairs are scraggly and all over the place. They shed, but you have to condition them and they should be okay. The \\&quot;eyeshadow\\&quot; brushes are not meant for makeup. You can find these brushes at a local craft store or something. They are very soft, but they are very smooth and sleek, which is good for painting, but not make up. Because of their sleekness, you are not able to pick up eyeshadows, and if you do, the brush absorbs most of the product and the product barely makes it to your eye. They need to be fluffier and less dense. Most of the eye brushes are also basically the same just in different sizes, and there is only one dome brush. I&#x27;m not completely disappointed, but i&#x27;m just grateful i have a different set coming in. You&#x27;re better off buying the set from china and waiting the three weeks for those, they are more effective.</li>
    <li> The only reason I bought this set was because of the great reviews... The ones that say they are &#x27;great&#x27; are freakin crazy! The brush keeps falling apart. Every time I wash them, they become worse. Furthermore they are harsh on my skin, and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. They also smell bad when they first arrive. The only good thing was that they arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> i do not know the use for half of the brushes but i love them, they look like good quality, they had excellent price, and mostly they work good.&lt;br /&gt;maybe it would be better if they come with small instuctions for begginers like me, but i&#x27;ll have to purchase a book or look info over the internet to fin out some of their uses</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the product is as cheap as it looks, despite the good reviews.  The box smelled like plasticky chemicals and so do the brushes.  Also, 1/2 of them are pretty much the same brush!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.  Go to target and purchase the ELF brand of brushes... they are only $1 each.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really good set. The only some of the brushes were kinda falling out of the shape before I even used them but other than that I love them</li>
    <li> After a year of use:  they didn&#x27;t hold up all that well. i still use some of them, but have replaced a few of the large brushes with better quality brushes from sephora.</li>
    <li> The case that the brushes are in is of good quality though the product has a chemical smell that will take some time dissipate.  Several of the brushes are the same (there is a minimal difference in length or structure of the bristles but very minimal) therefore it seems that most of the brushes are perfect for lip brushes or concealer brushes.  The large brushes shed VERY badly and need stray hairs clipped and also need to be snipped even if they are to be kept and or used.  For the price this brush set is a good deal, if you want quality brushes my advice would be to spend more to get it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really love these brushes. I recieved them as a gift, and I have only used them a few times. The big fluffy brushes shed like CRAZY! This leaves bristles and hairs all over my face, not cute! The smaller brushes all seem to be good so far. I don&#x27;t see myself actually using the big brushes, ever.</li>
    <li> For the amount of brushes you get, you can&#x27;t be upset about the price. It&#x27;s a great starter kit for beginners. The larger brushes could be more soft. It&#x27;s true about the smell of the case, however, just leave it out for 2-3 days and it should go away. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the buy and look forward to experimenting with them.</li>
    <li> the case realy does smell but easy fix just air it out. and the brushes do shed but not to bad. works for what i need them for</li>
    <li> If your not a professional and u need a set for everyday this is perfect.  There is some fallage from the brushes but over allnot an issue. The case stinks but I left it out overnight and Its fine.</li>
    <li> I really like that Amazon shipped my product so quickly and that it came in really good condition. This product I LOVE, it has all the brushes I need and it is compact and easy to carry with me to school, work and travel. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> love it so much and i use it all the time and i know my friends want one too lol</li>
    <li> This kit was for my brother&#x60;s girlfriend,and she was very happy with the quality of the product and still using it, no problems.</li>
    <li> These brushes are ok, they are a bit scratchy and I don&#x27;t really care for them. Will probably give some to my daughter so she can practice her makeup, she&#x27;s 10 years old!!</li>
    <li> These are amazing brushes!&lt;br /&gt;They are so so so soft. I have Mac brushes and these are even softer.</li>
    <li> Garbage.  The description referenced that this was made by MAC...not true.  Inferior quality and when I asked to return they did not even want the product back.  Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes last week and they arrived this week. I am a long time user of make up brushes and when I saw these for the price-I knew I had to have them. Love the variety of brushes; all of them will be used (some more than others). The case they come in is not leather; but vinyl and does have a stong plastic smell. It does not however take away from the brushes. I aired it out for a few days and it decreased but I do still smell plastic every so often. For the money you can&#x27;t beat them. I will probably buy a set for my daughter whose birthday is in October. I would also purchase them again for myself! Great buy!!!! :)</li>
    <li> Item arrived promptly and exactly how described. There are a lot of brushes for the price. The only downside is that the pouch that the brushes came in smelled so awful</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a good makeup brush set for a while.  This one has so many pieces, I dont think I will ever use them all.  Not the highest quality, but they are good.  No hairs falling out.  Nice and soft.  They work fine.  I would recommend this set to anyone looking for a nice set of makeup brushes</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes for my wife for christmas, and she loves them. Great variety of sizes and textures, she&#x27;s extremely pleased</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my 17 yr old daughter for Christmas, she absolutely LOVED it! Upon ordering this item, I received it within two days during the busy holiday time....which was very impressive!</li>
    <li> I am not a professional but I LOVE makeup!  So, the first thing I can say that it is a GREAT deal for 34 brush set.  For those that are on a strict budget, like myself, but does not want to forfeit the quality of the product, this is the way to go.  Warning! When you first get the brushes, open it and let the smell air out.  Then, I strongly urge you to properly clean the brushes! I washed them in soap water, and soaked them in hot water for about 5 mins.  The smaller beige colored brushes did well, but the face brushes (dark haired brushes) wanted to \\&quot;tangle\\&quot; up on me (I guess that is what you can call it).  In any case, rinse them in tap water, brush hairs facing down.  And let them dry hair facing down.  GOOD LUCK!  Now, I&#x27;m on my way to figure out what to/ how to use all these brushes!</li>
    <li> The bigger face brushes are a lil tough on my skin.  other than that they&#x27;re great especially for the price.</li>
    <li> What do you expect from a $20 purchase?.... This product is an excellent starter kit especially for the price!!! would recommend. Others are just being tooooo picky.</li>
    <li> The blush brush loses some of its hairs while applying makeup.  All the other brushes seems to be excellent.  Would recommend this package.</li>
    <li> Love them great quality lots of eyeshadow brushes great blush and foundation brushes  and fast shipping  thank you</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. The eye brushes are synthetic and in none of the reviews was that mentioned. My large powder brushes the handle is crooked from the base of the brush. I may only use a few of these brushes and will need to purchase another eye set. Very disappointing because now the money invested I could have purchased a starter set from Sephora. I do think some of the small brushes will be great for intricate eye makeup but not for daily use.</li>
    <li> these brushes are awesome, every size brush you would ever need, they are soft enough, and clean up great...best purchase I have made in a long time</li>
    <li> I can actually say they is worth the money I had to buy another one cuz my mom wanted mine</li>
    <li> You receive alot for your money.  I have shared some brushes with others , there are so many.  would order again.</li>
    <li> Loved that there were many different sized eye brushes however this set does not come with any blending brushes, i would suggest buying some seperatly (on amazon or bhcosmetics.com). The face brushes were also great and again came in many sizes. Please note that you may need to trim some of the face brushs yourself but it&#x27;s not a big deal, just a few longer bristles here and there :). There was a slight plastic smell when i got them but is was from the case not the brushes, air out the case and wash the brushes and you&#x27;re set! I&#x27;ve been doing makeup for years and over all would recomend this set to any aspiring makeup artists out there!! The only reason this review is not getting 5 stars is the lack of blending eye brushes :).</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Exactly as described. I purchased for my daughter the aspiring makeup artist and she was very pleased. The case was very professional and made traveling and separating the brushes perfect</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter she enjoying the brushes and work smoothly and the case is accessible the varies sizes are helpful.</li>
    <li> i LOVE these brushes!! i ordered these on a friday and received them the following monday. they are very good quality and DO NOT SHED!! and i have no idea where everyone else has been getting their brushes from, because mine did not smell. the handles of these brushes are very long which is nice. you also get a ton of different kinds of brushes along with a nice case. the case is not cheap-it is good quality and i plan on using it and these brushes for a very long time. hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t purchase this set of brushes-- The bristles fall out so easily and there are so many similar brushes within the set.  I threw the leather case it came in because it smelled so horribly.  I suggest saving your money and purchasing a higher quality set.</li>
    <li> All the brushes I have used perform well with the exception of one that for some reason is loosing its bristles. They are smooth and easy to clean or wash, I really like this set and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Ugh! These brushes are horrible. The worst part is I knew better than to buy these brushes. unfortunately, I read the reviews and there were several ppl raving about these brushes. If these are good quality to them, scary, I can&#x27;t imagine what would be crap brushes to them. Honestly, your better off going to michaels and buying brushes to use on your face than these. They have a strong chemical odor and the hairs are no better than bristles on a brush. Just bad. Please, please, please don&#x27;t waste your money. The elf brushes at target are much better quality and they are pretty cheap, I do own m.a.c. Brushes and sigma brushes, these don&#x27;t even come close. I will be giving these to my kids to paint with. Oh well, lesson learned. If your wondering why I gave these two stars, it&#x27;s because they arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> These brushes are OK for the price but I would not recommend for the large brushes...they were very rough...&lt;br /&gt;The medium and small brushes are good for the price but also aren&#x27;t as good as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again...</li>
    <li> Bought these as back ups for my nice sigma brushes. They fell apart as soon as I started using them. Hairs everywhere! And the top that holds the hairs together fell off! DON&#x27;T BUY! Waste of money!</li>
    <li> A terrific value.  This set includes all the essential professional brushes at a great price.  Love the professional, roll out case.</li>
    <li> OMG this set is Terrible!!!! all the brushes hair comes off!! I Hate it !!! DO NOT BUY IT PLEASE!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know for sure how my wife feels about them, but she was elated with the numerous sizes and shapes and the little extra tools besides the brushes.  It was easy to order and was shipped on time and my wife was surprised, that&#x27;s what mattered to me.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for a friend who is a professional make up artist.  She said that she was very pleased with them.  I was personally very satisfied with the shopping experience.</li>
    <li> The brushs are horrible. They broke off after like 3 uses. They&#x27;re all pretty much the exact same brush just a different size. I don&#x27;t recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> I was very amazed at the quality and the amount of brushes for the price. I would recommend them to friends</li>
    <li> When I ordered these I wasn&#x27;t expecting what I got. The brushes are really good except for one thing. Some of the tops (where the soft part is) just breaks off. Also the package that it comes in kind of stinks.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, and with that in mind the brushes are very soft for a CVS/Walgreens/Rite Aid quality set. One of the brushes is damaged with glue in the bristle, but I&#x27;m hoping I can get it out with a good wash. Not a set I would use on my clients, but fine to use on myself :)</li>
    <li> I ordered for my daughter who is a makeup geek. She loved it, the brushes were as good as the expensive kind. Great value.</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome. There were no stray strands and they work wonderfully. The leather pouch they came in did have a bad smell. It was really strong and I didn&#x27;t like it. The bag itself was okay but I probably won&#x27;t use it. I took the brushes out. When washing, I wrap them in a paper towel so they don&#x27;t lose their shape and they haven&#x27;t yet! They came VERY quickly and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Usually I buy separate brushes and finally decided to buy a set online. The 1-3 star reviews worried me because they were talking about how the brushes came in terrible condition [already broken, used, etc,]. But I decided, why not just order them? So I did and I do not regret my purchase! The brushes were neatly rolled up in the case, and each had its own little plastic cover thing that you throw away. The case smelled at first, but after a day of airing it out, it&#x27;s pretty much gone. :) I didn&#x27;t really mind that. The brushes work fine, but they shed if you put too much pressure on them.</li>
    <li> The eye brushes are nice and soft but the face brushes suck. They are rough and the hairs fall out on a massive scale. The case smells super bad and after airing out for 5 days it still has a rank smell. It is worth it to buy if you just want eye brushes, but don&#x27;t expect much from the case or the face brushes.</li>
    <li> Slightly extensive review:    Seller:  Amazing, I made my purchase early morning the 4th and it was in my mail box the evening of the 6th.  Extremely fast shipping, good prices.    Brushes:  Comes packaged in a leather case, everything was wrapped in plastic and appears brand new never used.  34 Brushes as described each in their own seperate plastic wrapping.    Quality: Ehhhh  When you&#x27;re looking at the factor of price for quantity it&#x27;s really really good.  When you&#x27;re looking for quality it could be better.  All of the brushes needed trimming which is something I expected for the price I was paying and I can&#x27;t really complain about that. But all of the poofier brushes (blush brushes, countour brush, dome brush, and fan brush) were all shedding.  Shedding &#x3D; not good.  It will mean that not only will I have to spend time picking the hairs out of my eyes, and off my cheek bones but I will have to replace these brushes probably in the next 6 months to a year.    Hair:  The Poofy brushes (blush brushes, countour brush, dome brush, and fan brush), are what looks to be immitation horse hair.  And they ALL shed.  The other brushes seem to be somewhat better quality, do not shed, and have a variety of sizes. I am un-certain of what they are made of.      Pros: All of the brushes are soft on the skin. There are 34 brushes of many sizes.  The flat brushes seem to be pretty good quality.    Cons: The poofy brushes shed a lot. There was only 1 dome brush in this kit and about 4-5 flat brushes that are so large they are pretty much useless.  It would have been nice if they nixed some of those brushes for a few more dome brushes of different sizes and brush strengths.    Overall:  It depends on what you are using this for as to wether or not I would tell you to buy it.  If you are using it for personal use (providing you&#x27;re not extremely picky about your make-up), first time make up users, or just need an extra set of in-expensive make up brushes then go for it.  If you&#x27;re looking for professional quality, using this as a professional MUA, or are extremely picky about your make-up then I would say spend a little more money and get a better quality kit.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend Love it! haha that&#x27;s what she told Me!&lt;br /&gt;So with that I think is a great product for girls.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very nice! It had a very weird smell, but didn&#x27;t bother me much. Not a very big deal. The thing is when I first washed the brushes a lot of the bristles came out...that&#x27;s a bummer. Only the two big brushes did. The eye brushes and the 3 blush brushes were amazing. Some red dye did come out.  Which is okay...i guess. Overall i love this brush set! Amazing and I&#x27;m glad I got this in the  first place.</li>
    <li> So I have wanted more brushes to work with and have been eyeing these for a while. Finally decided to order them. Shipping was pretty fast. It came before the estimated date and I was so excited!&lt;br /&gt;The packaging itself was pretty good. The case came in a plastic bag. However, the smell.. OH MY GOD! I could smell it from far away. I have read other reviews that if I air dry it, it should go away. So let&#x27;s see how that goes. The brushes are not so bad. Even though most of them are copies of each other just in different sizes. I wish there was another dome shape brush though. That would have been great. But there is only one. The brushes are soft and not so bad. I can use them for different purposes for the face/eye!&lt;br /&gt;Now for the major con part.. The 6 face brushes, ughhh. I am so disappointed! They are rough and hard and no so soft as the other small brushes. When you use them on your face, they actually poke you. It&#x27;s like back to using those cheap eye brushes that used to poke me in the eye lid. But thank god I have more face brushes that I like. So I&#x27;ll probably toss these away and replace it with my other brushes. But yeah, I wish that wasn&#x27;t the case.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not bad for the price. I wouldn&#x27;t spend so much money on sigma or mac brushes which was the reason I decided to try these out. And they are not bad (aside from the large face brushes, of course).</li>
    <li> Wish I had read the other reviews properly to know that the brushes had NO label. For a beginner its not a good set. I know as an immature you want to start cheap but its not worth having to research what each one is and why so much of them look alike.</li>
    <li> I know nothing of make up, or their brushes. But, I bought this set for my girlfriend and she couldn&#x27;t be happier. She keeps telling me how awesome they are, and how excited she is to do her make up.      I am not sure yet, but I think it has sped up the make up process.</li>
    <li> The quality of these brushes are the worst! I guess if you are just practicing then this is good for you. And it isn&#x27;t the ENTIRE kit... just the facial brushes. THEY SHED TERRIBLY!!! I don&#x27;t want to put on make up and have to pick brush hairs off of my face! They aren&#x27;t as soft as my other cheaper brush that i&#x27;ve purchased from Target in the past. The other little brush for eye shadows are good though. But it isn&#x27;t worth it! I really hate it and i wish i can return it. But i&#x27;ll just buy my own facial brushes else where with better quality. I changed the rating stars from a 3 to a 1. It was a 3 before i used them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY! SOME THINGS YOU JUST GOTTA SPEND MONEY ON!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this at first but after reading some of the reviews decided to take a chance and order this brush set.  As some of the other reviewers mentioned, the entire set smelled heavily and took days to air out.  The brushes were hugely unusable.  Most of the smaller ones provided looked like paint brushes.  The bristles on the large brushes were sparse and rough. All in all there was only one brush that was worth using.  Don&#x27;t waste your time and money and invest in quality brushes.  Guess the lesson here is that ya get what you pay for..</li>
    <li> Whether you&#x27;re a Professional Makeup Artist, Esthetician, Makeup Diva, or a New Makeup User, Amazon.com offers one of the Best Makeup Brushes selection on line.   I was skeptical at first because I am used to paying MUCH more for my tools. I ordered one set - when they came in I was so shocked -they are amazing!!   Now for everyone who wants to make a good first impression and to look exquisite on any occasion, the right tools for applying makeup are available economically in this set.  There are many different makeup brushes, each designed for a specific purpose but it is definitely important that you choose the right kind of brush  for great results.  If you are looking for  a bargain price on  a cosmetic brush set then  this is just what you need.  For people who have little idea on what particular makeup brushes they should have, buying a professional makeup brush set is a good investment. Makeup brushes are one of the most crucial tools for applying makeup that looks flawless and even.   This is a great price for a 34 piece professional quality brush set for a beginner looking for a complete makeover, or a professional enlarging their  brush collection.   These are ideal to apply powder products on face and body, and the foundation brush is great for liquids and creams.  The handles are made of quality wood which gives each brush a feeling of durability.   It is also important that your makeup brush&#x27;s bristles do not shed easily, especially during application and after the initial cleansing and grooming( removal of loose  brush hairs) on receiving this new set, excessive shedding was not a problem with this makeup brush set.  The brushes come with a good carrying case and each set features almost every brush you need and even more. For those who travel a lot, this is a great feature.  The brushes are pretty much all you will ever need. They are very soft and apply make up well. They are also easy to clean.   You don&#x27;t have to use expensive brushes to create fabulous makeup looks. Even though I own many high end products - I found I do not have to use only expensive brushes!   Nothing against them and not to say I won&#x27;t get any more in the future, but it&#x27;s good to have other options!</li>
    <li> I recently bought a lot of makeup, and realized I didn&#x27;t have the brushes to go with it. I did a fairly exhaustive search on Amazon and decided on the Premium Quality Studio Pro 34 Piece Makeup Brush Kit Set with Travel Case. It has a great assortment of brushes and makes me feel like a professional makeup artist in my own bedroom. But the set and feel like a pro!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that each brush was made with quality materials and included such an array of brushes.  The carrying case was also made from quality materials.  Now my daughter&#x27;s are asking for their own individual set.  At this price, they can expect to receive for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying these brushes.  It is a full set of 34 brushes; they hold up very well to daily use, and they clean up beautifully.  I&#x27;ve recommended them to friends and family.  A worthwhile purchase.</li>
    <li> I thought the brushes where to stiff. doesnt grab product very well. I wouldnt order this brand of brushes again.</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes for my wife who is a cosmetologist and she absolutely loved them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loved the variety this kits brings, but she said something about having to \\&quot;condition\\&quot; the brushes before using them because of the dyeing process the manufacturers use to make the bristles black will bleed onto skin over time or something.  but she apparently just washed em off because she has been using them steady since Xmas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, good stuff, good brushes, good price, good case.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the other reviews, I figured that this would be the set for me.  After receiving it, though, I was somewhat disappointed.  The smaller brushes are great for makeup for your eyes or concealer, but then when it gets to the bigger brushes is where it lacks.  I used each of them once and they fell short of my expectations. They bristles (or hairs... whatever you may call them!  Lol.)  were all over my face.  I gave it three stars because a little more than half were okay, and shipping was expedient.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great although I wish there was more of a variety of them It seems like there is 10 of them that are almost identical. But for the price you cant beat it.</li>
    <li> Wernt as soft as id like them to be. Especially the bigger brushes. The smaller brushes are better and softer, good quality  which is what i plan on using, and why i got the set initally.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THESE ABOUT A YEAR  AGO ...I WANTED TO GET A GOOD AMOUNT OF BRUSHES FOR A GOOD PRICE  34PCS SOUNDED GOOD AND I LIKED THE PRICE TOO.. HOWEVER WHEN I GOT THEM I NOTICED HOW CHEAP AND BAD THEY LOOKED , THE BRISTLES WERE HARD AND THE HANDLES WERE CHEAP..  THE ONLY GOOD THING WAS THE POUCH IT CAME IN AND MAYBE 2-5 BRUSHES OUT THE WHOLE SET. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BRUSH SET TO ANYONE!!! TRY THE COASTAL SCENTS 22PC BRUSH SET (MUCH BETTER) E.L.F BRUSHES OUR MUCH BETTER THAN THESE BRUSHES ALSO.. I ALSO LIKE SHANY COSMETIC BRUSHES ..</li>
    <li> Reminds me of a bunch of paint brushes, poor quality.</li>
    <li> These brushes are just elf (eyes, lips, face) but  with a different logo. These brushes are are not even soft and not worth $25 for sure! I am very disappointed with them. I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad batch if that&#x27;s possible because everyone else pretty much has good reviews and I unfortunately got some I did not like at all. I wish I never bought them because now I&#x27;m just never going to use them.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for decent brushes at a fair price these are the ones to grab :) I was worried at first that they would shed or have other undesirable qualities but I was proven wrong when I opened the packaging. I can&#x27;t say I have any concerns or dislikes about this product except that the larger brushes don&#x27;t feel as soft or smooth, but they&#x27;re not bad. I would recommend this item to any makeup junkie.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for a few months now and use them everyday! Great brushes, am very satisfied with them.</li>
    <li> I got this brush set mainly for the eye brushes -- there are so many of them and they&#x27;re nice and soft. I loved the way my eye makeup came out after using these brushes. If you&#x27;re looking for eye brushes, this set is great. However, the face brushes are course -- I prefer to use my MAC brush for bronzer and blush.</li>
    <li> For what you are paying its great! You get a load of brushes! the good shaped ones too. However... the bristles are low quality. so be gentle.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great for personal use but would not recommend to a makeup artist, invest in better brushes if that your career.</li>
    <li> these brushes i would say would be perfect for like a lil girls play make up set. they fall apart really easily. they did get delivered in pretty fast but i was expecting a better made set than this. i know i only paid 25 for it but that was bc they were on sale. if you could make the actual brush handles a little better than i would probably have given another star. i keep having to super glue all my brushes from this set. and they shed....... ALOT</li>
    <li> I hands down give the price a 5 star rating.  The brushes are a little less amazing, but the cases great, they are den sky packed so they pick up a lot of powder.  The face brushes are a little rough on the face though.  I loved the case, and it&#x27;s super easy to pack up and very condensed for easy travel. The handles are nice and thick, so they are easy to get a grip on.  They are also very long.  MASH 34 piece studio brush set is the way to go!</li>
    <li> The only problem I have with this brush set is the fact that the larger face and blush brushes shed. I&#x27;ve washed them a couple times and I&#x27;ve just come to the realization that they&#x27;re going to shed no matter what you do. However, the smaller eye and lip brushes work fabulously and do what they&#x27;re supposed to without shedding all over the place. So, all and all this set is okay. Nothing more nothing less.</li>
    <li> when i first got them, i was very excited to open them, so this are not natural, which is a big down for me, i dont expect them to be like sephora brushes, but at least have some hair in it!!, there is one brush that looks like \\&quot;natural hair\\&quot;, but it throws bristles like crazy, it never stops shading. Also, they are all the same, flat orange synthetic brushes , just one bigger and other smaller, i hate the fact that there is not one single brush to do a smokey eye or for the crust, nor for blending. I do use like 2 or 3 for my eyeliner, and other two for my eyeshadow simple application. I do like the fact that they are soft and u have to wash them before using them and also i liked that they were brand new, and that some of them i can use for nail art or something. they are good, they pick up eye shadow well enough, i just dont like the fact that they all look almost the same, that they are all flat, and that they dont have a blending brush, but other than that, they are fine.</li>
    <li> I love them.  I expected to get the brushes all crushed up and out of shape. But that was not the case.  They were wonderful and in perfect shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glenda Buis</li>
    <li> These are great brushes. Unlike the brush sets that claim they&#x27;re professional, there ARE actually professional brushes. I&#x27;m a makeup artist and I love these brushes. The long handles make it easier to apply makeup to both clients and yourself. The only thing I can say I don&#x27;t like are the large face brushes (red hair brushes). They&#x27;re pretty rough. Not soft at all. I&#x27;m going to try and soften them up with Olive Oil and Silk Drops during their next washing. That&#x27;s why I gave this set a 4 star rating. The eye brushes, concealer brushes, and lip brushes are perfect. Haven&#x27;t had any issues. Great set for MUAs or beginners. Like every set though, be sure to wash them and air dry them before your first use.</li>
    <li> I was so satisfied with this purchase! The brushes are amazing and so is the price. I could not beat this anywhere!! The delivery also was not that bad</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushed a couple of months back and I love them, they do not shed and they are not stiff like some other brushed that I&#x27;ve used. The quality for the price is seriously unbeatable. I would recommend these brushed for sure.</li>
    <li> The product has a variety of brush models which fits my needs.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend for those people who like make-up.</li>
    <li> Cheap quality brushes that had a strong formaldehyde odor lasted for months. The brushes she&#x27;d like no other day. I gave it a star because there was a good variety to the brushes and the roll-up case was usable. The brushes were discarded after six months. Do yourself a favor and purchase higher quality brushes.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my daughter and it had all the brushes she was looking for... Great set, She Loved it</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price, but the brushes do shed. Would love to have a brush list included.</li>
    <li> I’ve had this brush set for about 6 months.  They are not the best quality as they have fallen apart and I have had to super glue a couple back to the metal piece where the brush is.  The second problem is that all are flat brushes except one.  When you apply your eye shadow you need some round fluffy and stiff brushes, well you only get one round medium brush with this kit.  That seems a bit ridiculous to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the positives are that it comes with a ton of small brushes for detail and large brushes for blush and bronzer.  The carry case is really nice and is better quality than the brushes.  If I had to do it over again I would have gotten different set.  As a starter set though its great and will give you some great options.  Make sure you get a kabuki brush, foundation brush, and round eye shadow brushes when you’re starting out, if you’re going to buy this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because when you compare Mac brushes, these are pretty good, its just the glue to the metal, not the actual brush that I am calling into question.</li>
    <li> I just want everyone interested to know, that these are NOT in any-way-shape-or-form makeup brushes from M.A.C. I am a M.A.C artist and it infuriates me that companies out there try and dupe people into believing that they&#x27;re selling &amp;#34;M.A.C product&amp;#34; for less.</li>
    <li> this brush set is right for me now learning make up and it has all the brush sets it also has a leather case so if i spill its easy to clean up</li>
    <li> these brushes came complete and in perfect condition the bag is great and my girlfriend really enjoys her gift she likes how they feel</li>
    <li> Thank-you MASH for not letting me down. It was what I had ordered, and as advertised exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Okay so I purchased these brushes and before I knew it they were here. literally 2-3 days later. And I was away but when I came back into town they were here. And immediately I opened the packaging and I see what everyone was talking about with the smell. But in all honesty it isn&#x27;t something that I was too worried about. I put the case outside and let it sit in the sun for 2 days. And now it smells like nothing.As for when I got the bruses. I immediately washed them, with baby shampoo and I notices black dye coming from the facial brushes. I washed them 3 times EACH, and still dye coming out so im not too fond of that but The only thing that I can complain about are the face brushes. Here&#x27;s a little tip, If you&#x27;re ordering brushes online and the hairs are red. They&#x27;re going to be scratchy. BUT the eye shadow brushes make this set worth it. And I prefer lighter haired brushes because they&#x27;re soft. And even black haired brushes are soft. Im not sure why it is that the red haired brushes are so scratchy and they make it hurt when youre trying to apply makeup. Thus , I knew this would happen. so I also ordered the pink brush set. Im still currently waiting for its arrival but it should hopefully be here before the school year starts. I love the eyeshadow brushes in this set which make this set worth it but if youre looking for soft haired brushes. These are NOT the brushes for you.</li>
    <li> Dont buy it please... dont wasted you money!!! This brushes set is just HORRIBLE....larger brushes aren&#x27;t soft and the smaller brushes are basically the same, comes with the same brush at least 3 times</li>
    <li> I love this set.  The brushes are good quality and the set offers a great variety.  I bought this for my sister, but since trying them out, I want a set of my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for 1 week and so far i love them. their very well  quality for the price ill do another review in a few months</li>
    <li> This is the most complete set I have ever seen! I do believe that these are meant to be craft brushes because I have seen brushes exactly like this at Michael&#x27;s, Jo-Ann&#x27;s, etc, but they work just as well for makeup application, and for a great price!    The case is also wonderful. I am moving overseas in a few weeks and won&#x27;t have to worry about the bristles getting bent out of shape thanks to the great brush roll.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.    The sent Me the wrong order at first but after contacting the seller very kindly they sent out My order and told Me to keep what they sent for the mix up.    It came quickly and I love them.</li>
    <li> Theses brushes suck and not worthing buying ... to good to be true. buy elf brushes there really good and really cheap..</li>
    <li> Not a waste of money because i use them for cream,packing,or eyebrows,but only 2 of the eye brushes are soft the rest are stiff synthetic cheap brushes.out of this whole kit i maybe use 7 brushes and 3 are for eye brows so i would say dont waste your money elf brushes would be a better buy.i use the $1 brushes almost daily</li>
    <li> Good brushes until I used blush and other hair-like brushes... Very brittle and rough on skin also shed alot! Good for beginners not for professionals</li>
    <li> Everything as expected</li>
    <li> Love the quality! Only thing not to like is the new car smell of the leather case itself!  New car is not the scent I&#x27;m going for at my make up table!  That being said I&#x27;d still buy this kit again and again! I&#x27;ve been trying more things with my makeup and playing around with the different brushes to get a more put together look. My grandaughter and I are comparing notes and having blast with this set!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a big brush kit. While I admit some of these brushes do shed (some of the bigger ones - but I don&#x27;t use those much) the rest of them are perfect for what I need. I usually only use the eye brushes to do my eyeshadow. I wash them regularly and they all still look great and I&#x27;ve had these for probably over a  year now!</li>
    <li> A few minutes after i ordered these i got scared because i heard that the hairs fall out.  I got the brushes and the small ones are soft, but there aren&#x27;t a lot of fluffy brushes and there are a lot of \\&quot;paint brush\\&quot; like ones.  I did further research and saw that MASH is a nail company, which didn&#x27;t surprise me.  On the face brushes the hairs fall out and they aren&#x27;t very soft.  Overall the brushes were okay, since they were only $25 i am happy with them.</li>
    <li> Every kind of brush and applicator you can imagine al wrapped up in one neat folding bag.</li>
    <li> Was Way more that I expected</li>
    <li> received it &amp; love it! especially for the cheap price</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I ordered these brushes and even more excited when I got them in the mail a week and a half later. I opted for the free super saver shipping which is why it took so long. The brushes were packaged in a large padded vanilla envelope and then a plastic cellophane bag to protect the case and brushes. It did have an funky smell which I expected because the case is made of pleather not real leather but it went away after about a day. The brushes are like a dream I love how they feel on my face especially around my eyes because I have very sensitive eyes. The bristles did not fall out of mine like a few of the reviews here said they would. I think they may have gotten a dud set of brushes which does happen but if you have that happen I would exchange them. I only have one complaint and that is the brushes do not come with a guide on what all of the brushes are and their perspective numbers. Its easy enough to find out but still. That&#x27;s about the only down side I could find to buying these brushes besides when the price is right why not? Great price great brushes and very happy with my purchase hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Great product, for the price great deal! I read reviews how these brushes werent a great buy but honestly i have so many brushes to choose from and the bristles do not fall off unless ur pressong down really hard which is unnecessary to do so. I love these brushes! Dont miss out!!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend buying these brushes. I was looking for some, not really wanting a set but I came upon these and fell in love. There&#x27;s tons of brushes that provide vast uses. Easy to clean, super durable, and hold up well.</li>
    <li> The large brushes aren&#x27;t as soft as they could be, but they&#x27;re not terrible.  The smaller brushes are plenty soft enough for use on eyelids and such.  The fan brush is a little scraggly upon unwrapping it.  The brushes have much longer handles than I anticipated, making the package larger than I thought it would be.  However, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase, especially the blending brush.  There&#x27;s a slight smell to the case, but it&#x27;s not that bad--I can&#x27;t smell it unless I literally hold the case right next to my nose, and who does that unless they&#x27;re investigating something stated in a review?  The ties on the case are a strange length, making tying them in a bow awkward--if you wrap the case three times, they&#x27;re too short, but if you wrap it twice, they&#x27;re too long.  All the brushes come individually wrapped, and the larger brushes and fan come with covers to help them hold their shape.  The brushes shed a bit, but I haven&#x27;t noticed anything excessive.  For the value, I think this is a great set.</li>
    <li> Brushes are very scatchy and leave my face red and irritated</li>
    <li> I gave 2 stars only because there is a lot of brushes but out of all of them I only ended up using 5.. All the other either broke off or the hair started falling out.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.....the brushes have are made of reat quality and it travels well.I would reccommend this product to any fellow make-up lover !</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this but I feel like they just put a bunch of paint brushes in a fancy holder &amp; shipped it. The second I started unwrapping the brushes, 4 of the brushes came off of their handles. I&#x27;m throughly dissapointed &amp; wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and bought these to have on hand as a backup. They shed and are very, very scratchy! I wouldn&#x27;t use these on myself and I would never use these on a client.</li>
    <li> The quantity is awesome and the brushes are soft. Other than that, I would say pass. The brushes shed a lot and constantly come off the handles. Very disappointing. I found this out within a few times of using them. I pulled one of the brushes out to use and the head came off in my hand. I am now on the hunt for new brushes.</li>
    <li> This was a pretty good deal!</li>
    <li> As good as the price seems and by the pictures it looks to good to be true. I&#x27;m so disappointed as a makeup artist these brushes are TERRIBLE! Brushes were so hard on my face! These brushes didn&#x27;t look like makeup brushes, they look like brushes that you paint with on paper??!</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes in the beginning of 2012, and I use them almost everyday.  They work really well, they do not shed, they are very sturdy.  I wash them every now and then with a bit of shampoo and then rinse with some conditioner and water and let them air dry.  Once they are fully air dried just fluff them back out and they are as good as new.  I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for reasonably priced brushes.  It is all about how you take care of your brushes, take care of them and they would last you a really long time, as I said I&#x27;ve had mines for going on three years.</li>
    <li> I have bought brushes from 8- 23 dollars per brush and thought I did really good on some of my buys.  But this came along with looking at all different websites and stores for best prices, because I do like to look for the best deals. I also watch you tube to get some info there for some good ideas.  I even shopped amazon and didn&#x27;t see these brushes awhile back, but then recently shopped again for my niece and wow this popped up.  I could not believe the quality of theses brushes they are great, for the price it is so worth it.  You must buy it don&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
    <li> I am very picky with makeup brushes but was looking for an inexpensive brush set that would still be good quality! I am very pleased with these brushes, they are very sturdy and I love that the bristles don&#x27;t fall out like some of the other inexpensive brushes I have bought. Plus the case is awesome! I would definitely recommend this brush set to everyone!! I am actually going to get another set for my mom!</li>
    <li> I like this product. It works well for me and worth the money. I will recommend it to other people.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the quantity for the price. However the quality is not satisfactory. I was hand washing these cosmetic brushes and the fibers of the brush do shed quite a lot. I do not smell any unusual odor that the other reviews speak of . I smell leather. I am  content with this purchase and confident that it will get the job done.</li>
    <li> This is something that my daughter loved and wanted.  She is at that stage in life where she like to experiment with different looks for the eyes and such.  Smokey, dramatic, soft, neutral, etc...Must have for every teenager :)</li>
    <li> Hice esta compra para mi hermana. Me hab&amp;iacute;a pedido un kit completo de pinceles para maquillajes (entre otros productos), y seg&amp;uacute;n comentario de ella, le ha gustado mucho el producto. Ella no es profesional, aunque si maquilla a todas las mujeres de mi casa y familiares, los pinceles son &amp;uacute;tiles, cumplen su cometido, tienen una buena terminaci&amp;oacute;n y calidad. Ella muy feliz, porque es algo que siempre necesit&amp;oacute;.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my daughter in law for Christmas.  She was very pleased to receive this gift. It arrived on time for the holiday.</li>
    <li> My make up brushes came on time and they are definitely good quality, I just wish the bristles were a little but softer but I still love them I just need to break them in now.</li>
    <li> Brushes are very hard and shed on your face...the eye brushes are ok....maybe they will get better with each use.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.  I have always wanted a set of professional make-up brushes.  Now I have more brushes than I know what to do with...isn&#x27;t that exciting?!  I was a little worried that they might not be very soft considering the price I paid, but I was wrong.  They are really soft!  I am really looking forward to learning what each brush is for...definitely worth the money!!</li>
    <li> There is no variety in the brushes. The face brushes are extremely irritating. I probably only use 4 of the 34 brushes, and I&#x27;ve had this since last December.</li>
    <li> just perfect i love all the brushes and the case is very useful</li>
    <li> These are not Mash brushes. The item I received isn&#x27;t even what is pictured on the listing. The brushes are extremely cheap and all of the larger brushes shed very easily. There is some sort of orange dye on the eye brushes. Money could be better spent elsewhere.</li>
    <li> The case smells like synthetic leather. I had it for 5 days - and it was not getting any better. Anything that came in contact with this case - smelled the same.&lt;br /&gt;Variety is very poor - more than half of the brushes are almost identical.&lt;br /&gt;Right after I used facial brush - i decided to return it. Sheds bristles all over the face.&lt;br /&gt;You can get the same set of brushes straight from china for only $7 - but i would not even pay a $1 for it.</li>
    <li> The case material is cheap. This is not what I expected, but I will just have to do. I wouldn&#x27;t buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> Brushes are soft and great to use! Big handes to grip! Huge assortment to choose and easy to clean. Love this for work for my brides!!</li>
    <li> Very confused by the picture</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking I&#x27;d be getting M.A.C makeup brushes.  I should have the price was too good to be true. Shame on you!!!</li>
    <li> Great brushes thay did stink but when she opened up the package and aired out for a short time the smell went away but great brushes great application very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> These brushes are surprisingly decent in quality. There really are a lot of duplicates in this set; probably only 15-20 of them are different brushes. But this wasn&#x27;t a problem for me. I was planning to gift those duplicates, which my friends and relatives appreciated. I&#x27;m going to agree with pretty much everyone else who noted that the larger brushes were rough. I wish there was more than one dome brush, which I absolutely love! I love the dense &amp; stiff small brushes - usuallly smaller brushes are sparse and too fluffy for a precise application. I can&#x27;t stand the leather case&#x27;s awful smell. Even after 2 weeks, it still smells.       For the price, I don&#x27;t mind all the duplicates and the awful case.</li>
    <li> The face brushes shed really bad, warning. When ever v you apply face make up they give you brushles all over your face,  and the eye brushes aren&#x27;t that good fyi!</li>
    <li> When I ordered these brushes, I didn&#x27;t thought I would love them so much. For this price, it&#x27;s a very decent bargain. Brushes are super soft and I use them at least 3-4 times a week. I love these brushes so much that I am going to get 2 more sets for my sisters to gift them on Christmas...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am darn sure that they will love these brushes as much I do!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with the brushes, and there was a lot of brushes!  The quality was excellent, in fact, I was pretty impressed.  I would recommend if you want to get good quality brushes for a great price!</li>
    <li> All the brushes seem like they are mainly for the eyes. There are 5 brushes that are more blush brushes but work GREAT for final blending and dusting off when your done. If u need a lot of eye shadow blending tools these brushes won&#x27;t leave u dissapointed!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my neice and she was thrilled with it.I recommend it as a gift .</li>
    <li> I just received my brushes today as a gift from my business partner/ friend. They are great brushes. The issue I have with the brush set is that the big brushes ( contour, blush, dome, and foundation ) shed. Luckily, it didn&#x27;t shed too much. With a few washes, it should stop. This is the only reason I could not give this product 5 stars .</li>
    <li> As a special effects makeup artist, you need a lot of brushes to make the right effect, so this kit works perfectly, and for the price its definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I have never bought brushes other than sets of one or two at the Halloween store, so I had absolutely no idea what to look for, but one of my friends showed me this product and told me its what I need, so I took her word for it and she was 100% correct! There was a strange smell from the package when opened, but just wash the brushes and the smell is gone, or was for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are perfect for making bruises big or small, and are soft so they don&#x27;t cause harm to the model your working on. I used 2 day shipping and was surprised to see the UPS man at my door THE NEXT DAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were packed neatly and safely and none of the brushes were harmed, and they were each individually wrapped in plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to any SPFX artist, or just anyone who loves makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 out of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> An excellent product at an economical price for the &#x27;Budding New Make up Artist&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Service and deleivery was timely. I will recommend this product to anyone searching the market for this item.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s so many brushes I hardly know what to do with them all!&lt;br /&gt;When I first washed them out, there were a few that had a problem with some hairs falling out. Only about 2 or 3. I lathered it with a bit more shampoo and none more fell out after those, so no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re not as soft as I was expecting, but nonetheless perfect for the quantity and quality at the price.</li>
    <li> I cant say I don&#x27;t like these brushes, but I can&#x27;t stand the larger fluffy ones, that should be for foundation, blush bronzing etc. First off there is no way too differentiate between the larger brushes because they&#x27;re all the same. They shed on your face when you&#x27;re applying makeup (big no-no). They are soft but they are not very good quality, and the fan brush was crappy too. I do like the smaller brushes, like I love the smudging brush a lot more than I thought I would. The small angled brush is really good for liquid or gel lining, and the case the brushes come in is pretty nice. I wish the set had more of a variety of brushes they are pretty much all the same. If you happen to find a set with only the smaller brushes and not the fluffy ones I&#x27;d say get it. If you are looking for low cost brushes with great quality (and names so you know what brush is for what) I&#x27;d definitely recommend E.L.F. You can find them at your nearest Target store usually, and they are online too if you google elf cosmetics. They have more tools, and sales online.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking I needed all these brushes but there are so many brushes that I only picked about 6 that I use and put on the counter with the rest in a drawer. There are duplicates of almost all of the brushes. I found that the only brushes that were not there was a foundation brush other than that you could have a brush for every eye color, lip color, concealer and power/blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are full size and soft. I would wash them all when you first receive them that way all will be ready for use.</li>
    <li> Came in a great case. I haven&#x27;t got to use them just yet but they feel lovely!!  Can&#x27;t wait to get to use them.  They came sooner than I thought but there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that. Lol</li>
    <li> The brushes are not good. They shed a lot and are very rough. None of them are soft. Also, there is repeats of brushes in the set.</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t complain at all. There are a ton of brushes and the bag is nice. For $20 I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Lots of brushes, but they are flatter than I wanted. I thought I was getting a set of fluffy brushes. The bigger brushes are full and fluffy though (face brushes). But the eyeshadow brushes are flat and kind of stiff. They work well, just not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Was good purchase but brushes are cheaply made</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girl friend in additional to her nice collection.  She goes through this stuff like a sock.  Hopefully this will last a bit longer.  So far so good I think.</li>
    <li> It was a great price and added so many new brushes to my collection.&lt;br /&gt;Came on time and I was so happy.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;So many brushes for a great price&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;no names on brushes, so you have to look up what they can do&lt;br /&gt;the bag smells when it comes. So I threw it away and but my brushes in a glass container!!!!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes shed wayyyyy too much, who wants to pick hair off your face every second? Aint no one got time for that. And mostly all the brushes are the same.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with the product I received.  For the price, I was a little amazed I got 34 brushes, which made me question the quality.  But once I used them and realized how excellent the quality was, I feel like I owe you more money :)  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a absolutely great set.. Great price!! These  brushes are great quality, very soft! They have a strong smell at first, but goes away. Quality is great!  You will love these.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace one MAC brush. Got 34 great brushes for the same price as one.  Very happy with the quality.</li>
    <li> I decided to order these brushes after researching other comparable sets.  After cleaning and airing out the brushes, I gave them a test and was amazed!  They hold the powder very well and don&#x27;t have all the shedding that some people mentioned.  I definitely recommend airing out and cleaning the brushes because: 1) They do smell very \\&quot;plasticky\\&quot; and 2) you will eliminate any dye that is going to bleed out.  Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with this set and I am happy I didn&#x27;t spend big bucks on similar products!</li>
    <li> I just got my brush set two days ago and I love it, but there&#x27;s only two things I&#x27;m not liking so much. First off when you first open it from out of the box the case and brushes smell bad. It&#x27;s like a nasty odd smell and stunk up my room for the rest of the day. Then the last thing I&#x27;m not a huge fan about is that the big face brushes aren&#x27;t soft. The brushes to me feel like dog hair . Other then those two things, I absolutely love this brush set</li>
    <li> There is a vast quantity of brushes, but the quality isn&#x27;t the greatest.  It&#x27;s a good purchase for the price</li>
    <li> I had been thinking about these brushes for a few weeks &amp; after reading all the great reviews, I was sold &amp; thought it was a great deal. They arrived very quickly &amp; was packaged very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;They did have that smell that everyone&#x27;s talking about, but it wasn&#x27;t overpowering, didnt stink up the room, didnt get stuck on my clothes or anything like the other exaggerated reviews say.&lt;br /&gt;It was super pretty when I opened it! But ALL the brushes are literally the same &amp; they&#x27;re not even meant for eyeshadow application. The face brushes werent as soft as everyone on here states. Im not sure if its dust or makeup, but some of the brushes have it.. which is kinda disturbing. Another thing that stunk was the \\&quot;smudger\\&quot; brush.. I rubbed it on the back of my hand &amp; the sponge&#x27;s paint came off.&lt;br /&gt;I did need a few new brushes for lipstick/lipgloss application &amp; concealing... but I think I would have been better off just forking out the usual amount that I do but know for SURE that I would be happy with my product. Oh well, lesson learned. 2 stars for getting to my house so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-a bummed artist who was trying to save $ :(</li>
    <li> these brushes are soooooooo great for this price,it amazes me.&lt;br /&gt;not the highest quality but hair wont come up,so soft,it doesnt smell.&lt;br /&gt;i am a makeup artist,and it literally saved my life for sure!</li>
    <li> There are so many brushs it is the perfect gift to buy for yourself or someone you care about it roczz</li>
    <li> Brushes seem cheap quality and most I won&#x27;t use</li>
    <li> Great qty, quality not so much.  There are cheap brushes that are very soft, this just does not happen to be them.  It is very coarse, which I do not like for face.  The face is delicate, we should treat it nicely.  Most of the brushes were flat headed, just different sizes.  I feel like besides width, brushes should also change dimension shape and angles.  Not cool!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;beautiful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;five Star</li>
    <li> This is a great Item, Multiple Brushes for Makeup Application! Fast Shipper!  Happy Sister :)  Made a great gift for Christmas!!</li>
    <li> i dont like that they all look like concealer brush&#x27;s i only have one eye shadow brush and 1 smudge brush thats it and that one is hard as hell i wish i never ordered it hate it it was fast delivery but dont like brushs</li>
    <li> loved these. they shed a bit but most brushes do...&lt;br /&gt;The eye shadow brushes are my favorite..&lt;br /&gt;Def a smart buy..</li>
    <li> The brushes are a good price, however, I would rather spend a few more dollars on higher quailty brushes. The thicker brushes started coming apart and flaking on my face.</li>
    <li> Best set of make up brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned, hands down. The case helps protect them and keep them organized. What a great investment for use for a long time.</li>
    <li> This set has EVERYTHING and is reasonably priced.. great to give as a gift too- I will keep it in mind</li>
    <li> Just perfect, I love it so much. The brushes are soft and and the whole package is beautiful. I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am not a professional makeup person. Just an everyday person that wears eye make. But I love all the brushes. The smell everyone talks about when away after a day of it &#x27;airing out&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this or purchase this again. Well worth the cheap price for my makeup use!</li>
    <li> waste of my money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i really want to say something good but i cant when i opened the case i can see some hair coming out of the brushes and it keeps falling&lt;br /&gt;even when i tried it some of it stuck on my face&lt;br /&gt;the brushes are not soft at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dont buy it it&#x27;s a waste of money go for \\&quot;segma\\&quot; brushes a little expensive but worth it or you can choose the one you need its better and less expensive</li>
    <li> Theses brushes are nice and soft, but the shadow brushes are pretty stiff (maybe better for wet application, but I rarely use eyeshadow wet). Not my favorite kind of brush. They weren&#x27;t that expensive, which is nice. I&#x27;m keeping the few I liked and giving the rest to my kids to play around with.</li>
    <li> Again another great deal off Amazon.com.  Great quality brushed for a good deal. You can not find this kind of kit for this price any place. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Brushes are high quality and I am enjoying using them to create awesome looks for myself. I can finally pull off cat eyes and smokey eyes with a professional look!</li>
    <li> I bought these a while back and used them alot until someone stole them :( i will defintely be ordering more! they worked great just like MAC brushes!</li>
    <li> thought the brushes would be of better quality but the bristles tend to fall out often even when not in use.  but i like the versatility of all the different brushes it offers for a reasonable price</li>
    <li> Terrible, stiff, and it just falls apart. Only the small brushes are useful, the large ones will scratch your face and leave hairs all over it. Go with BH cosmetics brushes. Inexpensive and high quality.</li>
    <li> The brushes that came with the set was not useful they are not angled right and the are hard.and I  am talking about the ones that you would you use to put on blush or foundation the powder kind</li>
    <li> Great product I love the brushes probably didn&#x27;t need so many as im not a makeup guru. However a great affordable purchase</li>
    <li> The brushes are GOOD but they are not GREAT. They do the job, but I wish an angled eyeliner brush and more eyebrushes were included. Other than that, I was delighted to receive 34 BRUSHES for this price!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Only downside, the case the brushes are in smells terrible...otherwise good value</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price&lt;br /&gt;Had it a year ago and still working fine</li>
    <li> when i got the brushes a few of them were used. i emailed the seller to let them know and to get a refund. the seller told me she assures me that they do not sell used brushes. when i ran my finger across a few of them powder makeup came off of them. i know they were used. im not going through the hassle of arguing about it. ill keep the set if the $28 means more to them than a happy customer. i wont buy from this seller again. i did like the case so its not a complete lose lose situation for me. i will replace the bad brushes with new ones. the quality of the brushes?!?! when i first opened them they shed. i washed them really good and have only used a few of them once. they seem to be ok after the wash. i didnt have hairs all over my face anyways! i would say brushes are ok considerig the price, i loved the case. seller doesnt seem to know squat about customer service and customer satisfaction.</li>
    <li> I only use some of the brushes</li>
    <li> When you first open the package everything is sealed and brand new. Once you get your brushes wash it first. I pulled out the hair and it sheded, but now it doesnt seem to shed. After washing the brushes the brushes became soft. I love these brushes. the price is really great and i recommend this product to you. Thank you :)&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt; 34 brushes&lt;br /&gt;Good to have for spare&lt;br /&gt;Soft brushes&lt;br /&gt;Shipping went fast&lt;br /&gt;easy to wash&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Most brushes look the same&lt;br /&gt;No labels</li>
    <li> These brushes are soft and smooth. I love these brushes because my makeup looks wonderful. Plus the brushes haven&#x27;t fallen off just yet.</li>
    <li> They smell funny and when they were received all the big brushes bristles were bent to hell</li>
    <li> Rough texture even after washing. The smaller brushes are good for concealer but larger ones shed and don&#x27;t have a good shape.</li>
    <li> Every brush used, broke as soon as going to apply product to the skin! Every. Single. One.</li>
    <li> I bought this a while ago just to try it out since it was so cheap. The hairs in the brushes constantly are coming out. The quality of the hair on the brushes aren&#x27;t great especially the face brushes, they are kind of rough. The smaller brushes however i do like, they are not great but they are pretty good considering the price!!</li>
    <li> This kit is ok if you are just starting with makeup. The brushes are nice and soft (the face ones could be a bit softer). I wish they had more than just one blending brush. A lot of the brushes look alike (like a basic concealer brush) and I use them mostly for applying a colored base to the lid (having so many I don&#x27;t have to wash brushes everyday). With this kit you get a feeling about what brushes you may enjoy and you can always choose to invest in better quality for select brushes (if you really enjoy the fan brush, say). For the price they are quite decent.&lt;br /&gt;The two brushes I use most are: (1) the lip liner brush (which I modified into an angled eyeliner brush - it it AMAZING for that! It holds up very well in time too, unlike most eyeliner brushes) and (2)the small angled brush (very nice for eyebrows).&lt;br /&gt;My brushes have not shed in the one year I&#x27;ve had them. I give them four stars for the self-made angled eyeliner brush.</li>
    <li> One comb teeth was broken when I received it ..but I love the brush set ..I can finally do real make up</li>
    <li> i love them. love the fact they way they come in their on mesh and its worth it very excited to have them</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife, and she really likes them. They were shipped quickly and are of high quality.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable amount of brushes for the money. Good quality. Easy to clean and transport. Case is good quality as well.</li>
    <li> The brushes shed and I was expected at least one blending brush. It seems like you&#x27;re getting a lot but they&#x27;re just different sizes of the same brush. Also I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of weeks and one already broke on me. The glue they used on the handle isn&#x27;t very secure so be careful. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes and use them every day. They arrived at my house very fast. My only suggestion is that the brushes come with a description of their use.</li>
    <li> This makeup brush set is absolutely amazing! I can&#x27;t put in words how great this set is! Brushes have not shed (for me at least) like stated in other reviews. Maybe they&#x27;re using them too forcefully but this is a very high quality kit. Not only are the brushes themselves good quality but the leather case they come in is very high quality and durable. In love with this kit &amp; can&#x27;t rave about it enough! Have included my own customer images!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and at a great price. If I need more brushes in the future, I&#x27;m be back for these.</li>
    <li> This set is amazing. I have little shedding and these apply make up great. Could not have asked for more. Love the case and how professional it looks.</li>
    <li> Not at all the type of brushes that I was looking for. The brush hair is hard and coarse and most of the hair falls out quickly. The metal holder that fuses the hair to the brush itself is extremely loose and also falls off easily.</li>
    <li> Not of ver good cuality. Great for a student.</li>
    <li> Quality brushes in a vast array of sizes. The case is crap, but the brushes are just fine! Next time your wife leaves her stuff on the floor for the dog to chew up, this is an economical and satisfying way to put the dog back in the doghouse and get yourself back into the good graces of your significant other!</li>
    <li> The item is great and works as described. I would purchase this again if asked. Dont worry, Buy with confidence!</li>
    <li> Omg im so in luv. I seriously even slept with it. I even have it next to my chair. Im so &amp;#34;ok, I think she has a problem&amp;#34;. I actually just descovered makeup at a late age, late 20&#x27;s. So im excited to learn although I dont wear makup everyday I still enjoy the ride.</li>
    <li> WOW!  This is what I assume a professional would use.  The case is faux leather and I am very pleased, as it is more humane.  However it looks real.  This is a LARGE set of brushes!!  I was blown away at how large it was when I opened it.  The brush quality is great and has withstood a few washings already.  Really a fun splurge for any makeup lovers out there.  Plus it is a bargain for the amount of brushes you get for the cost!</li>
    <li> I loved these brushes. They were a gift for my girlfriend but I should of bought myself some as well.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price.  Would recommend that others purchase this brush set since it compares to more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and figured $25.00 bucks why not give these brushes a chance, i agree when they arrived today they did have a slight &amp;#34;Funny Smell&amp;#34; but that went away after letting them breath for a few min. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet but I can&#x27;t wait to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall i think for the price this is such a good buy, and great way to keep your brushes organized.</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loves these brushes, a lot of bang for your buck!</li>
    <li> Purchased this set for my Girlfriend and she takes this case every she can. I never thought she would use every single brush.... but she has.</li>
    <li> All i can say is that the brushes get the job done..but you get what you pay for. Definitely not MAC but still works. The eye brushes are good, face brushes are rough.</li>
    <li> to Much Shedding and repeated brushes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars only because the shipping was fast... But the brushes are really hard on the face they do not blend well. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re new or something but I didn&#x27;t like how they feel on my skin... I want to buy another one for my little sister but I don&#x27;t think I will.</li>
    <li> i have always wanted a brush set like this one and am very happy with my purchase because i always have enough of what i need!!</li>
    <li> I liked almost everything about the set except i was really hoping the bigger brushes for powder, blush,etc. would be firm. but besides that they&#x27;re a good set of brushes</li>
    <li> These are perfect. Bought them for my mom, I have a similar set, and I wish I&#x27;d gotten these, now. No harsh smell, the bristles are nice and soft. I&#x27;d definitely buy again. Also a nice selection of sizes/shapes. Easy to handle, perfect size.</li>
    <li> These are the worst makeup brushes I have ever had the unfortunate pleasure of having in my presence.  The yellowish colored brushes are ones I have had before in a similar brand and they can hurt when applying makeup because the bristles are so rough.  The reddish dark brushes shed in small clumps in your fingers as you are apply makeup or if you simply touch the brush.  That should NOT happen!!!!!!  I have had better makeup brushes in cheap Christmas kits I bought at Walmart.  I regret ever wasting my money on these.  Typically I give my nieces my makeup or accessories I don&#x27;t care for and I won&#x27;t even give these brushes to them.</li>
    <li> As a makeup artist I use quite a bit of brushes from many brands. Sigma brushes being my personal favorite, but I use anything from MAC brushes to Ecotools brushes. I got these brushes as a backup, but found them to be a general, all around waste. Most of them aren&#x27;t useful to start out with. Either they&#x27;re an odd size, an odd shape, or cut incorrectly. The brush roll broke two days after I got it. The few brushes I use(d) (and not even for makeup, mind you. I gave up on that) have gone in the trash as the glue didn&#x27;t hold and the handle and ferrule separated. I&#x27;ve never dealt with such crap. I know they were only $25 dollars but they are really a waste and the spending the same amount of money on an inexpensive brand such as Ecotools would yield much better results. I believe these brushes might frustrate a beginner as well. Save your money. Cheap crap is still crap.</li>
    <li> i wouldnt suggest buying this unless you just like having a few extra brushes on hand. personally, i HATE when my girlfriends come over and use my brushes because im ridiculously OCD about them. so its nice to have extras set aside that i dont care about. ive replaced the brushes in the pack with my nice ones and use the kit to carry them around. verry convienant. it did have a weird smell when i recieved it, but it went away.</li>
    <li> bristles were falling out before I even used it, making me hesitant to actually use them on my face as I had to pick the bristles off</li>
    <li> I will not need new ones forever. I needed new eye shadow brushes and this is great. It has smaller ones which are great for applying shadow as a liner as well as full sized brushes.</li>
    <li> I just recieved my brushes like 1 week earlier than expected it had a wierd smell but the smell goes away after a minute im inlove with these brushes. I dont regrete spending my money on them</li>
    <li> Good price, some good brushes, some not so much, for this price it was worth it. Shipping was a little longer than I expected but I recomend this product.</li>
    <li> Not the best brushes but they do the job. If you&#x27;re wanted for everyday use brushes may not last very long.  You do get a lot of brushes to choose from. Good price considering...</li>
    <li> Has all the makeup brushes that I would ever need, absolutely love this!!!</li>
    <li> i got these not sure what kinda quality they would be,  I am happy with them and would get them again and i would say yeah they are good and u will like them :) i did</li>
    <li> I only wished that it had writings on it to let you know what each brush was used for.</li>
    <li> This would be great if the brushes were actually really good I bought this as a gift set for my nieces who are really into make up and to my surprise neither one of them took them home on the plane I had asked my niece is why they had said brushes fell apart so I use them as paintbrushes for my art projects Quality could be much better in them and the metal part to be classed tighter onto the wood stick</li>
    <li> Works very well for what I use them for. Had a few of the brush heads fall off and had to super glue them back on but hey I don&#x27;t care they still do their job fine.</li>
    <li> my parents bought this for me for my birthday a few days ago and i was super excited! but i got it and it smelled which was not that bad and there are not any labels which is bad for a beginner like me i have no clue what anything is! im trying to look it up but not getting much luck but i guess i can just use the brushes that i know what they are used for</li>
    <li> Now I have all kind of brushes. You will love it too. It corresponded my espectatives and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a huge product &#x3D;) It&#x27;s the best brush set I have ever got with this price !!! love it</li>
    <li> Looked through a lot of brush set.  Ordered these and am extremely happy.  My friend&#x27;s birthday was perfect.  Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> The brushes came broken and the hair was falling out all over the persons face. These brushes are a digrace and I wouldn&#x27;t even want to pay one dollar for them. You should be ashamed that you sold something this low in quality.</li>
    <li> its all right . . .  it sheds alot ... and i dont like that . . . . .</li>
    <li> Brushes were nice some brushes lost a little of their hair. Case had a little bit of a smell but all in all I was pleased.</li>
    <li> There were more brushes than I know what to use them for. I would suggest either labeling them or enclose a form recommending what each brush could be used for.</li>
    <li> As soon as I started using the powder and blush brush it started falling apart leaving hair on my face.</li>
    <li> it did have a strong chemical smell but i washed them immediately and let the case air out. i love them now!!! i need the variety and for the price i paid.... it was completely worth it. im not a professional by any means but its great for my personal every day use!</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and they work like brushes that cost 300.00. Best investment ever. I have used them at weddings and photo shoots and love love love the end result.</li>
    <li> the brushes shed like crazy and they are the same type except in different sizes and it is really not worth it. The money i spent on these i could of bought nice ones from sephora and been much much happier with.</li>
</ol>
