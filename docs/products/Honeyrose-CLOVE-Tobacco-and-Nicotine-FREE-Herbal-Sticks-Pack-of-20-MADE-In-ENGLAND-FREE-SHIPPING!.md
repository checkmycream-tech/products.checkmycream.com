### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
      <li>anyways the blend of herbs honeyrose uses is a great mixture  </li>
      <li>I found them to be pleasant, with just an edge of a kind of &#x27;burning grass&#x27; smell.</li>
      <li>u guys couldn&#x27;t take 5 hits from a cigar thats for sure!</li>
      <li>Liked nor dish cigs better wont buy again</li>
      <li>I have the taste of clove, and the smoke is very light</li>
      <li>All in all they were ok.</li>
      <li>im sure i&#x27;ll keep buying more</li>
      <li>They are ok.</li>
      <li>Glad I just bought a couple of packs.</li>
      <li>BUT, hey its somewhat better for you.</li>
      <li>For all of these reasons, they are best suited for ex-smokers.&lt;br /&gt;Second, about the Clove flavor: my personal favorite.</li>
      <li>my favorite flavor so far...not too strong.</li>
      <li>I love this product really has a good taste</li>
      <li>Very good product overall.</li>
      <li>The ash doesn&#x27;t want to cleanly fall off.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re okay they do burn fast.</li>
      <li>: no scratching, no burning&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantage: are smoked quickly</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t even feel the need to clear my throat with these :)</li>
      <li>However, they burn very fast, and unevenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wonder what a tea would taste like if I dip this in hot water instead of lighting up.</li>
      <li>try different sorts and they are ok.&lt;br /&gt;- taste better than &amp;#34;Rockfield &amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not much real clove flavor, but the smoke is light and smooth.</li>
      <li>I did not think they had the as strong of flavor as regular cloves.</li>
      <li>For almost a year now with no desire to smoke a cigarette thanks to this product</li>
      <li>These aren&#x27;t really a replacement for the clove smokers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a smoker trying to quit, I just enjoy the act sometimes and didn&#x27;t want to smoke regular cigarettes.</li>
      <li>I really wanted a smoke so opted to try these</li>
      <li>I really like the flavor on these.</li>
      <li>Not really the strong flavor I was looking for.</li>
      <li>, they burn pretty fast compared to a traditional cigarette ..</li>
      <li>These have really helped me cut back on nicotine - more than any of the other things I&#x27;ve tried and that&#x27;s almost everything out there.  </li>
      <li>But they do help with the cravings and other psychological issues associated with quitting; they taste and smell better (or I should say less offensive) than tobacco cigarettes, relieve the urge to smoke and, the best part!, do not get you addicted.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The cherry on the end fell off completely the first time I tried to tap the ash out, and subsequent ones always burned the same way.</li>
      <li>Obscenely fast, and in a strange cone shape.</li>
      <li>The clove smell is not very strong, but the cigarette is smoother and burns better than other flavors.</li>
      <li>First about Honeyrose herbal cigarettes:&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, they&#x27;re different than tobacco cigarettes: burn faster, smell different, and do not offer the same &#x27;satisfaction&#x27;.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re in no way healthy and, ideally, no one should smoke them...</li>
      <li>Good fact is that they are not so addictive as the real ones, but this is not only because of the luck of nicotine but for the real bad taste they have, no even close to a real clove cigarette.</li>

<li> so be careful with that</li>
<li> But that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
<li> The stinging/burning sensation on the tongue is milder, and the aftertaste is less bothering.</li>
<li> As an anti-smoking tool, I feel like they&#x27;d be a little unsatisfying.</li>
<li> but they help the nervousness of not smoking while cutting back.  </li>
<li> These taste nothing like the original clove cigarettes, they leave a nasty aftertaste.  </li>
<li> Sorry.</li>
<li> This is uncomfortable to smoke and doesn&#x27;t taste a bit like clove.</li>
<li> They don&#x27;t taste awful, but not amazing either.</li>
<li> these stupid kids saying their vomiting their insides out from these things</li>
<li> Disgusting and horrible would never buy again</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They are ok. Feels like smoking tea bags. I wonder what a tea would taste like if I dip this in hot water instead of lighting up. BUT, hey its somewhat better for you.</li>
    <li> my favorite flavor so far...not too strong.</li>
    <li> Liked nor dish cigs better wont buy again</li>
    <li> They tasted like garbage.  I puked.</li>
    <li> idk whats up w/ these stupid kids saying their vomiting their insides out from these things but they are lying! u guys couldn&#x27;t take 5 hits from a cigar thats for sure! anyways the blend of herbs honeyrose uses is a great mixture  im sure i&#x27;ll keep buying more</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t taste awful, but not amazing either. I was expecting a fuller clove taste.</li>
    <li> Did like them Guess I stick to regular kreteks.  I did not think they had the as strong of flavor as regular cloves.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t really a replacement for the clove smokers. There&#x27;s just enough clove taste to provide the nostalgia., they burn pretty fast compared to a traditional cigarette .. But that&#x27;s to be expected. All in all they were ok. Glad I just bought a couple of packs. Not really the strong flavor I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I stopped smoking and was looking for an alternative because I miss the feeling of smoking&lt;br /&gt;I try different sorts and they are ok.&lt;br /&gt;- taste better than &amp;#34;Rockfield &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;- I have the taste of clove, and the smoke is very light&lt;br /&gt;me: no scratching, no burning&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantage: are smoked quickly</li>
    <li> Disgusting and horrible would never buy again</li>
    <li> These taste nothing like the original clove cigarettes, they leave a nasty aftertaste.  I would not recommend them at all.</li>
    <li> These have really helped me cut back on nicotine - more than any of the other things I&#x27;ve tried and that&#x27;s almost everything out there.  The paper and filter burn faster so be careful with that but they help the nervousness of not smoking while cutting back.  I really like the flavor on these.</li>
    <li> This is uncomfortable to smoke and doesn&#x27;t taste a bit like clove.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re okay they do burn fast.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t review the taste, because that is subjective. I found them to be pleasant, with just an edge of a kind of &#x27;burning grass&#x27; smell. However, they burn very fast, and unevenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cherry on the end fell off completely the first time I tried to tap the ash out, and subsequent ones always burned the same way. Obscenely fast, and in a strange cone shape. The ash doesn&#x27;t want to cleanly fall off. I&#x27;m not a smoker trying to quit, I just enjoy the act sometimes and didn&#x27;t want to smoke regular cigarettes. As an anti-smoking tool, I feel like they&#x27;d be a little unsatisfying. But as just something to inhale, they get the job done</li>
    <li> First about Honeyrose herbal cigarettes:&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, they&#x27;re different than tobacco cigarettes: burn faster, smell different, and do not offer the same &#x27;satisfaction&#x27;.

Very good product overall.</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t the tastiest ever, but if you don&#x27;t want tobacco this is the way to go</li>
    <li> I quit smoking 4 years ago but just about everyone around me still smokes and having gone thru some hefty stress I really wanted a smoke so opted to try these and they&#x27;re perfect. Not much real clove flavor, but the smoke is light and smooth. If I tried to smoke a regular cigarette after so long I&#x27;d cough my head off! Didn&#x27;t even feel the need to clear my throat with these :)</li>
    <li> Good fact is that they are not so addictive as the real ones, but this is not only because of the luck of nicotine but for the real bad taste they have, no even close to a real clove cigarette. Sorry.</li>
    <li> I love this product really has a good taste and it helped me to stop I am now smoke-free  For almost a year now with no desire to smoke a cigarette thanks to this product</li>
