      <li>Good stuff!  </li>

      <li>This lotion does a great job at addressing that with a couple of caveats.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too oily but it moisturizes my hands greatly.</li>
      <li>great stuff.</li>
      <li>Very nice lotion.</li>
      <li>Keep making amazing products!</li>
      <li>This stuff is honestly amazing!</li>
      <li>really good lotion, truly scent-free.</li>
      <li>and she loved it because it didn&#x27;t have a scent.</li>
      <li>My mom loved it...</li>
      <li>This one was fair and seems to be truly unscented.</li>
      <li>Love!</li>
      <li>But, this lotion is amazing.</li>
      <li>I also love this company, they just give me good vibes.</li>
      <li>All in all one of my favorite lotions that doesn&#x27;t have Shea Butter in it.  </li>
      <li>It works ok, but not as well as I was expecting based on the reviews.</li>
      <li>I love the packaging</li>
      <li>I will be buying again for sure as soon as my bottle runs out.</li>
      <li>This is the best hand/body lotion I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.  </li>
      <li>I was truly surprised and impressed at how well this lotion absorbed.</li>
      <li>Great for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Great, simple, unscented lotion.</li>
      <li>Scent free.  </li>
      <li>I make my own after-shave lotion (by &amp;#34;brewing&amp;#34; a blend of spiced in a mixture of witch hazel and vodka), and I needed an unscented lotion to add some moisturising effect to the final product without changing the scent that I had achieved from the spice mixture I used (which is the point of making my own after shave).</li>
      <li>I use it every morning right out of the shower and love it.  </li>
      <li>It does have a scent but one that is generally very pleasant and fades after a few minutes.  </li>
      <li>My skin is incredibly dry, and this is great for when I&#x27;m at work or school.</li>
      <li>Super silky smooth with no foul smell.</li>
      <li>A bit waxy but not unpleasant.  </li>
      <li>It moisturizes beautifully without leaving behind any sort of greasy residue which can be a problem with many beeswax products.</li>
      <li>I suffer from sensitive skin and atypical dermatitis reactions, and I&#x27;ve happy to report no flare-ups or itchiness after about a month of use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s creamy without being oily and it absorbs nicely again without a surface of grease left on the hands/body.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s super cute, super small bottle which means it fits in my purse and is easy on the go.</li>
      <li>The price was reasonable too!</li>
      <li>When I first put it on, it made my palms feel greasy.  </li>
      <li>Order more Naked Bee products on Amazon when we got home.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>We liked it enough that I bought another one for my wife&#x27;s car after only using the first one for a day.</li>
      <li>Truly unscented and not greasy but very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It also lasts through 2-3 hand washings - a real plus  </li>
      <li>After such success with this product, I plan to purchase more products from The Naked Bee with the hopes that they all meet the performance bar this lotion has set so high.</li>
      <li>I also have put this on my lips and face when it gets a little too dry during the day and it works great.</li>
      <li>I was hoping it could replace a scented (thick) hand cream I have that works incredibly well on dry hands, but the search continues.</li>
      <li>I showed this product to my dermatologist who planned to share it with several other patients who preferred natural products but were struggling to find a good brand that caused no problems while sufficiently taking care of their skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The lotion got here extremely quick and was packaged perfectly, no open seals, etc.</li>
      <li>I purchased several more in different scents for family members.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s unscented which I love because then people don&#x27;t freak out about heavy scents when I use it.</li>
      <li>Other products are as good for less money.</li>
      <li>It is not a thick lotion and does seem to wash off right away, but really no complaints!</li>
      <li>I like this because it is natural and is unscented.</li>
      <li>however it smells like a old dirt</li>
      <li>However, after about 10 minutes, the greasy feeling went away leaving my hands feel soft and soothed.  </li>
      <li>This lotion leaves your skin soft</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t know about all of you guys, but I drink a ton of water throughout the day which means I am going the bathroom frequently, which then means I&#x27;m washing my hands</li>
      <li>There is no discernible scent for this product, and this is a big benefit for people who seek out natural products but at times have to keep looking as the natural scent is too pronounced.</li>
      <li>Nice product, but a bit expensive.  </li>
      <li>It was a little greasy at first but then dissipated.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy, but I prefer it that way, so I&#x27;m not desperately waiting for my hands to dry before I touch anything.</li>

<li> Winter plays havoc on my skin and becomes &amp;#34;flaky&amp;#34; dry, but NOT with Naked Bee.  </li>
<li> I have been searching a long time for a lotion that is not greasy and is truly unscented.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hands feel wet and gross.</li>
<li> This is definitely a lotion to try if you are a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees lotions or any other brands of beeswax based lotions.</li>
<li> It manages to soften dry hands and ragged cuticles without resorting to any of the chemicals rapidly losing favor with conscientious consumers, and it does so without price gouging.</li>
<li> ALL of the time, which leads to dry and cracked hands!</li>
<li> Bought the first tube of this in Arizona on a winter trip and couldn&#x27;t believe how soft it makes you hands after exposure to wind and cold.  </li>
<li> We both have very dry hands from hand dish washing and use of alcohol-based disinfectants.  </li>
<li> Since I only need a little for my small hands that means it will last me longer, even bigger score!</li>
<li> I only need a little dab to rub around.</li>
<li> It was actually VERY difficult for me to find a decent, all-natural unscented lotion at a reasonable price.</li>
<li> Not sticky or oily - great to have at work because I am on the computer a lot and hate greasy keys!</li>
<li> I really like that this lotion is unscented, but it is too thin.</li>
<li> And it does leave your hands a bit slippery/greasy but only for a few minutes as well.  </li>
<li> Wish it came in larger size, but not available from manufacturer.</li>
<li> For those that work in medical or other environments where scented products are prohibited, this lotion would go completely unnoticed.  </li>
<li> I will not buy it again due to the \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; ingredient.</li>
<li> This just does the job of keeping my skin intact with none of the mess hassle of anything else I&#x27;ve encountered.</li>
<li> The cap clicks tightly shut</li>
<li> so there&#x27;s little worry of finding a mess at the bottom of your</li>
<li> little tube of wondrous lotion deserves to be given a chance.</li>
<li> It was also a little pricy.</li>
<li> is keeping my usual chapped winter hands at bay.</li>
<li> And when they describe this product as \\&quot;unscented\\&quot;, they are 100% serious.</li>
<li> heals my cracking, bloody mechanic hands all winter long.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve hated lotion my entire life.</li>

    <li> Super silky smooth with no foul smell. Love!</li>
    <li> This is a long-lasting moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  A bit waxy but not unpleasant.  Protective</li>
    <li> heals my cracking, bloody mechanic hands all winter long. and it takes just a &#x27;dab&#x27; to thoroughly coat hands. great stuff.</li>
    <li> Bought the first tube of this in Arizona on a winter trip and couldn&#x27;t believe how soft it makes you hands after exposure to wind and cold.  Order more Naked Bee products on Amazon when we got home.</li>
    <li> This lotion leaves your skin soft however it smells like a old dirt cellar.yuk</li>
    <li> really good lotion, truly scent-free. Great for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Nice product, but a bit expensive.  Other products are as good for less money.</li>
    <li> This stuff is honestly amazing! i don&#x27;t know about all of you guys, but I drink a ton of water throughout the day which means I am going the bathroom frequently, which then means I&#x27;m washing my hands ALL of the time, which leads to dry and cracked hands! Yuck! But, this lotion is amazing. I only need a little dab to rub around. It&#x27;s not too oily but it moisturizes my hands greatly. Since I only need a little for my small hands that means it will last me longer, even bigger score! I love the packaging it&#x27;s super cute, super small bottle which means it fits in my purse and is easy on the go.

Keep making amazing products!</li>
    <li> My mom loved it...and she&#x27;s picky about lotions.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a lotion to try if you are a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees lotions or any other brands of beeswax based lotions. It moisturizes beautifully without leaving behind any sort of greasy residue which can be a problem with many beeswax products. I was truly surprised and impressed at how well this lotion absorbed.

I showed this product to my dermatologist who planned to share it with several other patients who preferred natural products but were struggling to find a good brand that caused no problems while sufficiently taking care of their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nickel sized amount of lotion is enough to thoroughly cover both hands and forearms, so this 2.25 fl oz tube lasts quite some time. It also lasts through 2-3 hand washings - a real plus  The cap clicks tightly shut so there&#x27;s little worry of finding a mess at the bottom of your bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little tube of wondrous lotion deserves to be given a chance.

After such success with this product, I plan to purchase more products from The Naked Bee with the hopes that they all meet the performance bar this lotion has set so high.</li>
    <li> No scent, not greasy and our hands feel great! Bought it for a friend too who is going through Chemo and she loved it because it didn&#x27;t have a scent.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand/body lotion I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.  A co-worker gave me a tube for my birthday and I&#x27;ve been a devotee ever since!  It&#x27;s creamy without being oily and it absorbs nicely again without a surface of grease left on the hands/body.  I use it every morning right out of the shower and love it.  Winter plays havoc on my skin and becomes &amp;#34;flaky&amp;#34; dry, but NOT with Naked Bee.  No flaking even after a 10-12 hour day at work!  I have a pump bottle on my desk at work, next to my bed, in my living room and in my bathroom.  I also use the unscented because I don&#x27;t like lotions competing with my perfume.</li>
    <li> Very nice lotion. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dude. I&#x27;ve hated lotion my entire life. Winter in MN cracks my hands and that hurts. I&#x27;ve finally found a lotion that 1. Doesn&#x27;t smell, 2. Doesn&#x27;t make my hands feel wet and gross. This just does the job of keeping my skin intact with none of the mess hassle of anything else I&#x27;ve encountered. Will buy for life.</li>
    <li> I like this because it is natural and is unscented. It moisturizes nicely and fits perfectly in&lt;br /&gt;my handbag. It is not a thick lotion and does seem to wash off right away, but really no complaints!</li>
    <li> Great, simple, unscented lotion. My skin is incredibly dry, and this is great for when I&#x27;m at work or school. It&#x27;s not too heavy, but I prefer it that way, so I&#x27;m not desperately waiting for my hands to dry before I touch anything. This combined with slathering my hands with shea butter at night is keeping my usual chapped winter hands at bay. I also have put this on my lips and face when it gets a little too dry during the day and it works great.</li>
    <li> I have been searching a long time for a lotion that is not greasy and is truly unscented. This product is just what I was looking for. The price was reasonable too!</li>
    <li> A lot of products claim to be unscented, but they&#x27;re not. This product is truly scent-free! (This is a must for me, because my husband can&#x27;t stand the scents of hand creams.) Furthermore, it works great!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Wish it came in larger size, but not available from manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I really like that this lotion is unscented, but it is too thin. It works ok, but not as well as I was expecting based on the reviews. I was hoping it could replace a scented (thick) hand cream I have that works incredibly well on dry hands, but the search continues.</li>
    <li> Purchased for myself and my wife.  We both have very dry hands from hand dish washing and use of alcohol-based disinfectants.  This lotion does a great job at addressing that with a couple of caveats.  It does have a scent but one that is generally very pleasant and fades after a few minutes.  And it does leave your hands a bit slippery/greasy but only for a few minutes as well.  All in all one of my favorite lotions that doesn&#x27;t have Shea Butter in it.  We liked it enough that I bought another one for my wife&#x27;s car after only using the first one for a day.</li>
    <li> Softens and moisturizes hands without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> Good stuff!  Not sticky or oily - great to have at work because I am on the computer a lot and hate greasy keys!</li>
    <li> It was actually VERY difficult for me to find a decent, all-natural unscented lotion at a reasonable price. This one fits the bill perfectly. I make my own after-shave lotion (by &amp;#34;brewing&amp;#34; a blend of spiced in a mixture of witch hazel and vodka), and I needed an unscented lotion to add some moisturising effect to the final product without changing the scent that I had achieved from the spice mixture I used (which is the point of making my own after shave). This worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> Scent free.  After ~2 weeks, seems to be working well.</li>
    <li> This product contains \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;, although I do not detect any scent.  When I first put it on, it made my palms feel greasy.  However, after about 10 minutes, the greasy feeling went away leaving my hands feel soft and soothed.  I will not buy it again due to the \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; ingredient.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best lotions I have tried. Truly unscented and not greasy but very moisturizing. I purchased several more in different scents for family members. Everyone loves them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the look out for unscented lotions since I need one that I can use during hunting season. This one was fair and seems to be truly unscented. It was a little greasy at first but then dissipated. It was also a little pricy.</li>
