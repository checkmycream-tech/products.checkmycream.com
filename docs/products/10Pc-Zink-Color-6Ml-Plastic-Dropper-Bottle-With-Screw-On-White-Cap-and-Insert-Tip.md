    <li> These are tiny little dropper bottles, 5ml is a teaspoon, these hold 6ml. However, these were perfect for my needs- travel size beauty containers. The dropper tips snapped in securely and easily, and the bottles didn&#x27;t leak. I was able to use them with facial cleansing oil and gel face wash, they worked fine at dispensing liquids that are slightly thicker in consistency than water. I only needed 3 days worth of product, these were the perfect size.</li>
    <li> These days, flying is tough enough without having to leave behind some of my toiletries that I only use a small amount of on a daily basis.  The bottles are perfect: small enough for those minimally used items.  The bottles also have an optional dropper attachment, which I use on some items and not on others.  These are a good plastic, strong but soft and flexible, and should last quite a while.  (Nothing lasts forever.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t need all 10, but the cost was so reasonable it didn&#x27;t matter. Other bottle suppliers had minimum orders with outrageous shipping charges, but the cost for these was very reasonable.  Thanks to the seller for carrying these.</li>
    <li> Love these things, Iam able to travel with my essentials without sacrificing space and having to carry large bottles that can potentially spill.</li>
    <li> These bottles are great.  I bought them to reduce the weight in my backpack.  I have had sweetner and campsoap in two these in my pack that is stored up, laying down, on its side, etc.  No leakage so far.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted!!!</li>
    <li> I kept getting what I thought were eye infections from contact solutions, but what I actually found was that my eyes were rejecting the preservative Thimerisol in the solution. I switched to a hydrogen peroxide contact cleaner which turns into a preservative free saline after cleaning. This saline doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all, but I wanted something to bottle it with and take with me as eye drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These little bottles are perfect! They come in 3 parts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) the main bottle tube.&lt;br /&gt;2) the dropper part that snaps into 1).&lt;br /&gt;3) the cap that screws down onto 2).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great part is that when you screw the cap, 3), onto the dropper it actually clamps the 2) into 1) making it mega secure with no change of liquid escaping. Being able to carry around a tiny bottle of saline with me when I wear contacts is a lifesaver. The bottle height in total is about 2.25 inches.</li>
    <li> I find these bottles break easily and are not reliable for travel.</li>
    <li> Bought for camping so I could break down the amount of fluids of various types that I have to bring.  It works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m airbrushing with watercolors and there are a few colors that I use a lot of. These bottles are small enough to not use a lot of paint, but big enough to mix enough to last for a while. A real time saver and a great deal.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting these to come in a reusable clear plastic pouch with a slide closure and a cute, white, swirly design printed on it. Bonus! I&#x27;m going to use mine as a travel toiletries bag. Seller was ZinkColorbeauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dropper bottles are exactly as expected, otherwise.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a small dropper bottle that I could carry in my purse for contact lens solution.  These bottles are perfect for that!  I tried to buy these bottles elsewhere, and the price was much higher.  I didn&#x27;t need all 10 bottles, but for that price ($1/bottle), I now have plenty of spares! These are duarable bottles that do not leak.  I would recommend these to anyone who wants to carry just a small amount of contact lens solution in a purse, makeup bag, toiletry bag, etc.  Great find at a great price!</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic droppers! I use them for art projects with liquid watercolors and they do not leak and are easy to clean! I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Plastic bottles met my needs very well. They are leak proof and will hold any type of liquid. They are perfect for essential oils, and are small enough to fit in most bags easily.</li>
    <li> I use these to carry unpasteurized cider vinegar in my purse which I use on my cuticles when they start to itch (it helps!).  these are very small, have an optional dropper, and don&#x27;t leak.  As I lose them or toss them I&#x27;ll definately be buying more.</li>
    <li> I fill these with my travel and backpacking needs.  I also love to have one in my purse with &#x27;stevia&#x27;.  Great bottles!  If you have a label maker you can label them all easily.  I also have the 30 ml. size.</li>
    <li> love this. genius packaging-- it&#x27;s refillable, compact, and excellent for travel. Definitely will be repurchasing from this seller once I run out!</li>
    <li> Not much to say, here. These are very small bottles. I made a little holder to keep 8 of these bottles at hand, on my bench. I keep an array of solvents and oils and adhesives in these. Anything you might need in small quantities.</li>
    <li> Got these for medical kit items such as ointment to pack light in a hiking/traveling bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;-For fluids, great,&lt;br /&gt;-for small pills, great as well! (Ibuprofen round tablets wont fit.)&lt;br /&gt;-3 parts: cap, bottle, dropper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dropper part is optional, and should only be used for very fluid items like eyedrops, shampoo, etc... i tried it with neosporin and it just didn&#x27;t work, so ditch the dropper for stuff like that.</li>
    <li> Great no spill droppers. I use them to carry toothpaste and mouth rinse on-the-go.  I brush after every meal and these droppers keep all my items discrete and safe. Even in my pockets or pocketbook I have had no spills or messes. They are easy to refill and a snap to use. A+</li>
    <li> poor picture was misleading</li>
    <li> Perfect for first aid kits; I used for hydrodren peroxide and betadine solution in my first aid kits. They were easy to fill and are leak-free thus far. I printed clear vinyl labels which adhered well to the bottles. They are perfect little bottles for just about any application.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I wanted. I used a knife to cut the tips off of some containers when the viscosity was greater and I could not squeeze stuff out of the tube. Totally work the price. The three part bottle allows you to decide if you want the eye dropper portion or not.</li>
    <li> great for my liquids on the go. dont leak so far and seem constructed well. the tips are prettt constricted so litteraly drop (widen with needle or a  &amp;#34;pokey&amp;#34; for easier dripping)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these droppers for several different things so far.  I have dishwashing liquid in a couple of them right now.  I have packed a few of these in my survival pack for washing dishes.  It only takes a drop to wash/scrub out my canteen cup--why waste space and supplies?  I am going to try using for saline/cleaning solution for my contacts lenses as well.  Should be very good for a 1 or 2 day supply.  I will continue to think up more uses for these.  They are very tiny, and you could carry them just about anywhere.  I would say the size is about 1/2 that of a bottle of eyedrops like Visine or contact rewetting eyedrops.</li>
