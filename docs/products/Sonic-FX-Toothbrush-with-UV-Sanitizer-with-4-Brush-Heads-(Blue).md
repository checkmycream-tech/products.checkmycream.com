### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I bought two of these toothbrushes about 9 months ago and they both do an excellent job of cleaning our teeth.  </li>
      <li>I got them with a groupon at a great price and would recommend these to anyone.</li>
      <li>Have had it for over a year now and everything works good.</li>
      <li>My dentist raves about how good my teeth look now.</li>
      <li>The Dental Hygienist is very pleased.</li>
      <li>We had Sonicare brushes before for a lot more money and these rate just as good as the Sonicare.  </li>
      <li>My past two dental cleaning appointments have been great: no tartar build up and my gums are in excellent condition.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m totally satisfied.</li>
      <li>Overall very good deal if you can get them while on sale.</li>
      <li>I love the UV light, no worries what is getting on your toothbrush.</li>
      <li>The brush is so light, it slips out of my hand when I brush.</li>
      <li>It had a coupon with it for free replacements for life if you bought their tooth polish which I did.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited the day i received it</li>
      <li>Love ours, we bought our first one (This was our first electronic toothbrush ever) while on sale from the company website for about $40.</li>
      <li>It does have powerful brush.</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed was that it was kind of cheap looking, but i figured as long as it worked</li>
      <li>I bought two of these through Groupon, and so far they work fine.  </li>
      <li>It works the first 3 months</li>
      <li>Wish I would have read reviews first.</li>
      <li>Their idea of customer service and quality products is twisted, at best.</li>
      <li>It appears to work but after 10 sec the charging light turns off the brush but the uv light still works.</li>
      <li>it could have been a real fire hazard.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really care.</li>
      <li>I even had my boyfriend try it (to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just me or having sensitive gums etc), and he had the same reaction.</li>
      <li>If only their customer service had been even close to some of the other companies from whom I have purchased things that didn&#x27;t work as they were supposed to, I would rate it fairly good.</li>
      <li>I like it so far.</li>
      <li>The head completely broke off.  </li>
      <li>I bought it for my 10 yr old daughter and it stopped working after 3 months.</li>
      <li>I complained TWICE about the UV light bulb dying, looking for a replacement bulb, if nothing else, and was told basically &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>It hardly ever runs at full speed and no way to fix it.  </li>

<li> But this is apparently not something this company cares about.</li>
<li> I bought this through Groupon, worked great for 6 months then the plug in at the base got hot and burned the plastic base, the UV light went out and now it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>

<li> At first use though it will hurt or at least feel very uncomfortable but you will get used to it very quick.</li>
<li> I would give this less than one, I would give this a zero since it only lasted for 4 weeks of use.  </li>
<li> I bought the pink set in groupon.</li>
<li> Just gotta be careful with the power plug, as it will corrode like anything electronic if it sits in a wet atmosphere.</li>
<li> Be careful-</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if the bristles are super spikey or what, but it was painful and not possible to brush with.</li>
<li> The battery does not last past 10 months and it is therefore useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I wonder if the 4 brushes could be used in other brands.</li>
<li> Also few of the brush heads are freaking sharp</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste time and money on this product.</li>
<li> When I searched there, I found the missing email with the code.</li>
<li> a sham</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> Waste of money- very disappointed.</li>
<li> I am so incredibly disappointed and frustrated with these people.</li>
<li> Very disappointed with this product and do not recommend</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> DO NOT BUY  I purchased one with a groupon.  Only worked for 4 months and of course the warranty was only 90 days.  I tried reaching out to Sonic but no luck-all  they did was to try to sell me another one.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!</li>
    <li> I got mine a year ago from Groupon. My dental hygenist raves about my teeth now.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 of this 17 months ago on nomorerack.com for 50 dollars each. After a year, the battery won&#x27;t hold a recharge. The brush is so light, it slips out of my hand when I brush.</li>
    <li> Do not.  I repeat do not buy this product.  The battery does not last past 10 months and it is therefore useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a sham it is for anyone to sell this piece of gargbe</li>
    <li> I bought this on another site and would have returned it if it hadn&#x27;t been non-refundable.  Now I know why.  It hardly ever runs at full speed and no way to fix it.  Piece of c___.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these toothbrushes about 9 months ago and they both do an excellent job of cleaning our teeth.  We have had no problems what so ever with either one.  We had Sonicare brushes before for a lot more money and these rate just as good as the Sonicare.  I got them with a groupon at a great price and would recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am so incredibly disappointed and frustrated with these people. I complained TWICE about the UV light bulb dying, looking for a replacement bulb, if nothing else, and was told basically &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34;. It didn&#x27;t even last six months and these people expect to give me a discounted price to buy yet another something that will probably be just as crappy. DO NOT buy from this company. Their idea of customer service and quality products is twisted, at best. If only their customer service had been even close to some of the other companies from whom I have purchased things that didn&#x27;t work as they were supposed to, I would rate it fairly good. But this is apparently not something this company cares about. There is MOLD growing on my damned toothbrush heads and these people won&#x27;t even replace their less than six month old product.</li>
    <li> I like it so far. Haven&#x27;t used any toothbrushes like it, so am getting used to it. No problems. It does have powerful brush.</li>
    <li> I bought the pink set in groupon. It works the first 3 months then it stops working. I haven&#x27;t met charging prob. But after charging, it just doesn&#x27;t work... I wonder if the 4 brushes could be used in other brands.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush on a groupon, and totally regret it. I was so excited the day i received it, I couldn&#x27;t wait to take it home and try it out. The first thing I noticed was that it was kind of cheap looking, but i figured as long as it worked I didn&#x27;t really care. So i load on my toothpaste and begin to brush. &amp;#34;OW&amp;#34; is an understatement. It literally felt like i was brushing with needles. I don&#x27;t know if the bristles are super spikey or what, but it was painful and not possible to brush with. I even had my boyfriend try it (to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just me or having sensitive gums etc), and he had the same reaction. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Like everyone else I purchased mine from a groupon. Not even 2 months later the brush would stop working. The lights on the brush turned on but the brush would no longer vibrate. Also few of the brush heads are freaking sharp its like needles to my gums. Very disappointed with this product and do not recommend</li>
    <li> I totally like this product. Yes your gums are sore in the beginning but they have to get use to it. I love the UV light, no worries what is getting on your toothbrush. I&#x27;m totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this through groupon and all I can say is &amp;#34;ouch!&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve never had a toothbrush hurt! Might as well use needles to brush my teeth. Waste of money- very disappointed. 😔</li>
    <li> I bought Sonic-FX from nomorerack.com for $49 about a year ago.  My past two dental cleaning appointments have been great: no tartar build up and my gums are in excellent condition.  The Dental Hygienist is very pleased.</li>
    <li> Love ours, we bought our first one (This was our first electronic toothbrush ever) while on sale from the company website for about $40. Have had it for over a year now and everything works good. Just gotta be careful with the power plug, as it will corrode like anything electronic if it sits in a wet atmosphere. Bought another one around Christmas time just because we wanted one for travel. My dentist raves about how good my teeth look now. At first use though it will hurt or at least feel very uncomfortable but you will get used to it very quick. Overall very good deal if you can get them while on sale.</li>
    <li> Wish I would have read reviews first. I bought brush on Groupon one month ago and last week the charger no longer works. It appears to work but after 10 sec the charging light turns off the brush but the uv light still works. and it looks cheep. Don&#x27;t waste time and money on this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this through Groupon, worked great for 6 months then the plug in at the base got hot and burned the plastic base, the UV light went out and now it doesn&#x27;t work.  I have no way to get my money back.  Be careful- it could have been a real fire hazard.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these through Groupon, and so far they work fine.  It had a coupon with it for free replacements for life if you bought their tooth polish which I did.  I was irritated because I didn&#x27;t get the coupon code.  I contacted the company again and still did not hear back from them making me think the company was suspect. Turns out the emails were going to my junk folder.  When I searched there, I found the missing email with the code.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is a piece of junk. I bought it for my 10 yr old daughter and it stopped working after 3 months. Would not recommend waisting your money.</li>
    <li> I would give this less than one, I would give this a zero since it only lasted for 4 weeks of use.  The head completely broke off.  The sonic fx website for warranty does not work.  Buyer beware!!!!!  If you do not buy this product through manufacture website you will play heck getting the product warranty as well.</li>
