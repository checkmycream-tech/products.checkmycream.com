    <li> I&#x27;ve got very thin hair, which is thinning even more with age, and this shampoo adds volume.  It&#x27;s not a lot of volume, but it&#x27;s noticeable.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A SHAMPOO THAT DOES A GOOD JOB AND ALSO IS PRICED RIGHT...SMELLS GREAT AND WORKS GREAT...PERIOD...IF THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THEN THIS IS IT.</li>
    <li> I read several people&#x27;s reviews before buying, when I received is completely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product you can buy without problems</li>
    <li> I have fine hair with blonde highlights, other shampoos dry out my hair but Extreme is perfect.  I have been using for at least 4 years.</li>
    <li> Great product a good price.  I buy this in bulk because is is less expensive way to buy a quality product</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo for my thin fine hair. I have tried other shampoos but always come back to Redkin-Extreme</li>
    <li> My stylist started me on this product about 8 months ago.  The problem for me was the cost.  Then I found Redken online.  This is a great deal!  Three times as much product for just a few dollars over what stores charge for a small bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Really like the shampoo, makes hair soft and manageable.  Definitely going to order again.</li>
    <li> I just started using Redken shampoo this past Spring by recommedation of my hairdresser.  I love it.  It makes my hair managable and I do not have to use a conditioner everytime I use it, only occassionaly when my hair is dry from sun exposure.  It was a lot cheaper purchasing it from Amazon and I got a larger salon size bottle</li>
    <li> Helps keep the dry ends of my hair from frizzing up.  The large size makes it quite economical.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Redken New Nouveau Extreme Shampoo is the bomb!!!!! I tried it out today because, my hair was very brittle and dry. My hair was in need of  an emergency repair. This shampoo is the best of all the Redken line. After i washed my hair, it felt smooth, soft, and healthy. I can feel the moisture from the shampoo conditioning my hair. It left my dry, brittle,breaking hair soft and manageable. This product actually does what it say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This my new staple shampoo.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great if you fry your hair with dye. Like it a lot.</li>
    <li> My hair is getting thicker and I believe it works very good.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s little pricy but it&#x27;s worth it.  Good</li>
    <li> Redken Extreme shampoo is my favorite. It smells nice.  It repairs, prevents and leaves your hair shiney and full looking.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is just amazing!!! It´s really hydrating, and makes your hair feel soft!!!! It also makes your hair feel stronger, if you have chemically treated hair! I always have a bottle around, even if I try other shampoos (I like to change shampoos from time to time!!!!)but my hair really needs it after 1 or two washes with another shampoo! I just can´t get enough of it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Extremely satisfied, great deal!</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be an awesome shampoo, but it&#x27;s just ok...nothing miraculous about it.  For what you will pay I would buy something cheaper and then get a really good conditioner.</li>
    <li> Just amazing love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used! I first used it in cosmetology school and it even made the mannequin heads hair soft and smooth! The seller shipped it fast too. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner, especially for hair that has gone through any treatments. I have my hair straightened at a salon every 9 months or so and this conditioner in combination with the Redken Extreme shampoo and Anti-Snap Leave in Treatment make sure my treated hair is soft and has no breakage.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever for dry, breakage prone hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years and it is excellent.  Over the past year or so they changed the design of their cap and I have to say that I thoroughly dislike it.  Way more flimsy than the prior version and clearly a cost cutting move.  I&#x27;m still buying the product, but if the cap aggravates me.  If something else comes along that I like, I&#x27;ll switch products.  May seem crazy to get stuck on a lid, but I really liked the way it was.  High marks for the hair product, low marks for the person who had the idea to cheapen the cap.  Same thing with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, the lather and effect of this shampoo. Cleans without stripping my hair completely, but leaves no grease behind like some &amp;#34;clarifying&amp;#34; shampoos. A little does a lot, so it&#x27;s a good value, too.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing shampoo !!! At the beginning I wasnt sure if its for me because I have normal/dry colored hair so I bought only 1.7 oz bottle for trying but I noticed huge difference after one using !!! My hair looks healthy and its really shiny. Absolutely fantastic product!!! I will keep it for sure !!</li>
    <li> Perfect shampoo for my hair.</li>
    <li> Use with hair mask and anti-snap for amaze results! My hair was straw before and now I go for trims less frequently and can actually run my fingers through my hair!</li>
    <li> I love Redkin and this shampoo is great for dry hair like mine, when you live in a dry area.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have had terrible breakage over the years; from shoulder length to close to my ears without a haircut ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have  not paid so much for a shampoo before. This shampoo is well worth it. I  am going in the other direction from short  to  my hair growing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used the extreme Redken  conditioner and the Redken CAT protein treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I did. Thanks</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product for people with dry hair..I leaves my hair soft &amp; manageable and no frizzies. I found a winner !!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft and manageable.  Smells great.</li>
    <li> This is the best line of hair products I have ever found for chemically processed straightened hair. Gives hair a sheen and softness that can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Make sure and get the 33.8 ounce pumps to help get shampoo out.</li>
    <li> I cannot do the review because, i asked 2 times for the shampoo and i received the wrong product all the purchases! Im so desappointed!</li>
