      <li>I love it!</li>

      <li>So happy I found it here for such a great price!!</li>
      <li>I am just sharing my own experience here for anyone who might find it helpful:</li>
      <li>I just feel like my face feels kind of greasy if I&#x27;m sweating a lot.</li>
      <li>The &#x27;Yes&#x27; products are wonderful, but you need to be sure you are buying the right skin line for you.  </li>
      <li>Yes To Blueberries is by far the best.</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells, I love the way it feels on my face, I love the way it makes my skin look!</li>
      <li>If the weather isn&#x27;t hot and humid, this is great.</li>
      <li>Not oily - very smooth</li>
      <li>I need more time to assess it.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m just not in love with how it feels on my face.</li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>this product is ok.</li>
      <li>I love that this is lightweight.</li>
      <li>but this one is MUCH better for my skin.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like it that night--</li>
      <li>I have been more than pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>I much more prefer the Overnight Hydrating for day and nighttime use.</li>
      <li>What I love most about this product is that it&#x27;s gentle, works great under makeup, and provides sufficient hydration.</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I love many of the YES products, this blueberry line is the exception to that statement, however.</li>
      <li>I love the</li>
      <li>so I stopped using it thinking maybe my skin would like it better after it was done.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I am glad I switched when I did.  </li>
      <li>My skin looks healthy, even and is glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Then I put it on my face, and learned that it is much more of a sunscreen than a moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>And now, halfway through the day, I can&#x27;t feel it without touching</li>
      <li>Favorite moisturizing &amp; firming cream I have ever used.</li>
      <li>and I think she&#x27;s pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>but I find it pleasant and refreshing - and normally I&#x27;m VERY picky about smells...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very smooth and has a light chocolate smell.  </li>
      <li>My skin in finicky so when I found a natural product like the Yes to Carrots line that didn&#x27;t make my skin over react and my ezcema pop out, I was jumping for joy.  </li>
      <li>Love that its cruelty free.</li>
      <li>But, I&#x27;ll try another animal cruelty free product which is more hydrated.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking to also minimize pores and the appearance of fine lines, you might want to keep looking.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have strong odor (important with anything on my face)  </li>
      <li>This one product has not done a huge improvement either</li>
      <li>Light texture, blends in well.</li>
      <li>I enjoy using this brand</li>
      <li>It is non-irritating and goes on smooth under makeup.  </li>
      <li>(SLL free shampoo and hair moisturizer, and SLL free soap for body)</li>
      <li>I was so excited about the ingredients in this product &amp; couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
      <li>I love how natural it is, and that is is not cruel to animals...</li>
      <li>Fragance is clean.</li>
      <li>This is an AMAZING moisturizer that leaves my skin very soft.</li>
      <li>but so far I love it!  </li>
      <li>i can now order it and get it right to my door!</li>
      <li>The great thing is this will last longer because you dont need to use much!</li>
      <li>I wanted to love this stuff, I really did.  </li>
      <li>and even then you don&#x27;t need a full pump</li>
      <li>THE SKIN IS GOING TO BE SO SOFT AND NICE</li>
      <li>Easy on skin, safe on sensitive skin types.</li>
      <li>I use most of the &amp;#34;Yes to&amp;#34; products, I LOVE the Yes to Blueberries Daily Repairing Serum, but realized I needed a moisturizer too.  </li>
      <li>Takes a little time to absorb but my skin looks great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too soon to say if it&#x27;s repaired anything, but I can feel confident that I&#x27;m using a natural product on my face.</li>
      <li>(My 14 year old daughter uses Yes to Cucumbers and that is her favorite.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not irritating, does not cause reactions on my sensitive skin, smells nice, delivers what it promises and is calming to the face.  </li>
      <li>, maybe 1/2 a pump&#x27;s worth.  </li>
      <li>The benefit of knowing you are doing something for your skin in a more &#x27;natural&#x27; way is so comforting.</li>
      <li>I also love that this product is natural, so I have no reservations about putting it on my face and neck.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and my skin feels soft and clean when I use it.  </li>
      <li>non-greasy and great for dry, sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>If you apply it sparingly, it soaks right in.    </li>
      <li>and I thought their anti-aging line would be right up my alley.</li>
      <li>Feels very rich and greasy when first applying it, but dries quickly and leaves my skin glowing... and despite that initial greasy feeling, my face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  </li>
      <li>Nice light weight moisturizer for year round.</li>
      <li>I also noticed that my skin gets very oily and shiny quickly when I use this product.  </li>
      <li>This is the third &amp;#34;Blueberries&amp;#34;  product I&#x27;ve purchased and I love it.</li>
      <li>The Daily Repair is &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;, but being in my 40&#x27;s, I need more moisture on my skin.</li>
      <li>That also happened to me the first time I used them together.  </li>
      <li>I chose to rate this product with 5 stars because I&#x27;ve purchased more facial moisturizing products than I can recall, and</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the Yes To products.  I have tried the Yes To Carrots facial cream but this one is MUCH better for my skin.  I am 47 and have T-zone oiliness.  This takes just a tiny bit to make my skin feel soft without feeling oily.</li>
    <li> Love it! I read the reviews and my advice is a little goes a long way. I do have dry skin and am used to using a couple of pumps/descent amount of moisterizer but this I only needed a little over a pea size. So use about a pea sized amount and rub in well. It isn&#x27;t like most moisterizer and does feel a little greasy but it is really good stuff!! Just start with a very small amount until you learn how much you need. The great thing is this will last longer because you dont need to use much!</li>
    <li> Great product. So happy I found it here for such a great price!! I will def shop with you guys again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved the Yes to Cucumbers products, and since I&#x27;m now 38, I decided to try the YTB moisturizer. The first night, I applied it to my face and neck after cleansing. I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like it that night--my face felt sticky--but I&#x27;ve kept using it. You need very little product to do the job. One \\&quot;pump\\&quot; of lotion is enough for my face and neck. If you apply it sparingly, it soaks right in.    There is a scent that I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on.  It&#x27;s blueberries plus something else. I like it, but I know not everyone will.    It&#x27;s too soon to say if it&#x27;s repaired anything, but I can feel confident that I&#x27;m using a natural product on my face. I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> Feels very rich and greasy when first applying it, but dries quickly and leaves my skin glowing... and despite that initial greasy feeling, my face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Hydrates skin well and leaves a youthful glow on your face.  Drys a little sticky, but a quick wipe with a cloth will take away that feeling.  Easy on skin, safe on sensitive skin types.</li>
    <li> Love this product! A little goes a long way!  I feel that my complextion has actually gotten better and the lotion isn&#x27;t heavy and absorbs quickly, will definetely buy again. Also does not conflict with my makeup! Bonus as I am daily makeup user!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! My skin feels amazing!</li>
    <li> My skin in finicky so when I found a natural product like the Yes to Carrots line that didn&#x27;t make my skin over react and my ezcema pop out, I was jumping for joy.  I&#x27;ve quickly bought more of their products, often popping into their other lines like Yes to Cucumbers and Yes to Blueberries.  Just turned 29 so I thought I would buy this product to keep the years back a bit from showing on my face... wish I could return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For background, I am a caucasian with natural strawberry blonde hair, a spackle of freckles on my face and the classic T-Zone.  I can be prone to white heads/black heads around my chin and sides of my forehead, so for that reason I still use a deep poor cleanser from Neutrogena.  I used this prodct for a couple of days and didn&#x27;t like it.  But I was a few days out from the start/end of my feminine cycle so I stopped using it thinking maybe my skin would like it better after it was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It continued to leave my skin oily, puffy looking and it never felt like it soaked in. Thankfully I found Yes to Cucumbers Calming Moisturizer in my local big chain store several days ago and switched to it.  Took a day or two for me to notice a difference but I am glad I switched when I did.  My skin looks healthy, even and is glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviewers, maybe this product is meant for those with advanced years on their skin, or for other folks with different skin types.  But I couldnt&#x27; stand the product and now endorse the Yes to Cucumbers Calming moisturizer.  Make the switch!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I stopped using it for a few weeks and noticed a big difference in the lines on my face.  I won&#x27;t stop again!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t a fan. Didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> Takes a little time to absorb but my skin looks great.</li>
    <li> Yes to Blueberries Daily Repairing Moisturizer is the best daily moisturizer I have found for my extremely dry skin for such a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> this product is ok. I am in my twenties with combination skin, i am always on the hunt for something new. I bought this product thinking I would use it every day, but it is too thick and does make my skin oily. So I have been using it as a night cream, and wow, big difference! i finally determined that i only need about half of a pump of the product, which completely covers my face. in the morning my skin feels so soft and looks brighter. this is the first yes to product i have bought, but i am definitely willing to try the other yes to line!</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of the Yes To product line.  This is the third &amp;#34;Blueberries&amp;#34;  product I&#x27;ve purchased and I love it. It&#x27;s not irritating, does not cause reactions on my sensitive skin, smells nice, delivers what it promises and is calming to the face.  I&#x27;m a believer in blueberries!</li>
    <li> THE SKIN IS GOING TO BE SO SOFT AND NICE I HAVE EKSEM ON MY EYE AND THIS CREAM IS NOT IRRETAING</li>
    <li> A bit oily for my skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased the entire moisturizing portion of this line yesterday morning, including the serum, the eye cream, the eye roller, the day cream, and the night cream.  I started using the line as soon as I got it home.  I&#x27;m sure it has some great benefits with dedicated use, but here&#x27;s the problem:  I can&#x27;t stand to keep using it!  The day cream is the worst of the lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells awful -- nothing like blueberries, to say the least.  It&#x27;s ridiculously thick, first refusing to rub in properly (especially over the serum) and then leaving a thick, waxy film on my face that I couldn&#x27;t possibly wear makeup over (not to mention that feeling is horrible).  And now, halfway through the day, I can&#x27;t feel it without touching but my face is still partly waxy, partly oily to the touch from the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll go back to synthetic-heavy lines like L&#x27;Oreal.  I do know I will NOT continue using Yes To Blueberries.  I&#x27;m stopping on my way home from work, today, and getting something else.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer! It is great! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 to 3 months now. I really like it. It makes some of my facial skin have a bit of shine to it, such as my nose in particular. But, my skin is never dry! I prefer natural skin care products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for 3 days but so far I love it!  It goes on smooth and a little goes a long way.  I have a hard time finding truly \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;organic\\&quot; products but this is close.  It does have alcohol in it or I would have given it 5 stars.  Great find!  I like it enough that I&#x27;m going to try out some of the other products from this line now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months now and I still like it!  It&#x27;s light and my skin feels soft and clean when I use it.  Also, my skin has improved some, I&#x27;m breaking out less and my skin seems smoother.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference with any sunspots but I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about the ingredients in this product &amp; couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I quickly noticed lots of little white pus pockets all over my face. The acne that&#x27;s under the skin instead of on the surface &amp; red. As soon as I stopped using this product the acne went away.</li>
    <li> I have a very very sensitive skin. I have tried Cetaphil Vanicream and Neutrogena moisturizers for sensitive skins. All these products give my skin rashes and I don&#x27;t know why. Vanicream  literally make my skin peel off. The only product that works for me is yes to blueberries. The first time I purchased this product I was not happy about the smell. Since my skin is super sensitive I though I should use a product without smell. However this product is acting very well on my skin. My skin was always red (because of rashes and dermatitis), it was always peeling off and I did not have any idea why. I still don&#x27;t know what is wrong with my skin, however after doing the following steps my skin has started to heal dramatically and I am receiving compliments of people about how my skin has started to heal and look healthier and more clear. These steps work for me. I am not saying it will work on you too. I am just sharing my own experience here for anyone who might find it helpful: 1- I stopped using products containing SLL in the shower. (SLL free shampoo and hair moisturizer, and SLL free soap for body) 2- I stopped applying make up 3-I stopped using sunscreen and I protect my skin with visor, hat and not being in the sun (My skin is so sensitive it gives rashes even to physical sunscreens, you might not need to stop using sunscreen) 4-I stopped washing my face with any product, just water. 5-I started using yes to blueberries moisturizer for my face</li>
    <li> Love it!  Fresh and smells awesome!  I can definitely tell the difference using it has made to my skin! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I left a review on the NIGHT TIME version of this as well. I love many of the YES products, this blueberry line is the exception to that statement, however. I didn&#x27;t find it moisturizing in the least. I&#x27;m in my 50s and I thought their anti-aging line would be right up my alley. It&#x27;s not. And it stinks.</li>
    <li> Got this at Marshall&#x27;s for about $6 (yes, the 1.7 oz)!  I would buy it again for that price but not full price.  This moisturizer makes my face feel tacky/sticky and look shiny. I only use this at night now and in the morning I use the Yes to Tomato moisturizer, which I&#x27;ve purchased a couple times from Amazon.  I might as well mention here, I&#x27;d give that one four stars.  It&#x27;s very smooth and has a light chocolate smell.  The weird thing about it is that after application, if I get hot- I&#x27;ll feel the moisture/sweat on my skin, freaky!  Could it be the pore-protecting properties working?</li>
    <li> I was looking for something for my hands.  I was using a variety of different creams but with all my daily hand washing and sanitizing my hands looks old and wrinkly.  They looked 10 years older then the rest of me.  I read about Yes To Blueberries and decided to try it.  I had to go on and write a review because after two days of using the Daily Repairing Moisturizer and the Intensive Skin Repair Serum I already see a difference.  This is only day 3 and my hands are smoother and softer and don&#x27;t look like old lady hands anymore.  I am so impressed with this product and will keep using it for sure.  I ordered it on a Friday and got it Monday just like I wanted.</li>
    <li> I really like the Yes to Blueberries line of products.  I know some people complain about the smell but I find it pleasant and refreshing - and normally I&#x27;m VERY picky about smells... I don&#x27;t generally like scented items and find many scents way too strong and/or gross.  I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in my skin / wrinkles over the last few weeks that I&#x27;ve been using this but I haven&#x27;t found any products yet that do that for me!  I just like this because it feels good on my skin and smells good to me as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this natural product because I have perioral dermatisis and a lot of products irritate my skin.  This did not cause a break out however, I don&#x27;t like the sticky feeling it leaves for hours.</li>
    <li> I much more prefer the Overnight Hydrating for day and nighttime use. The Daily Repair is &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;, but being in my 40&#x27;s, I need more moisture on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I am afraid to post a positive review because it will sell out and I wont be able to get it.  They came out with this same item with spf, but it is awful.  So I have to find this one wherever I can.  Nice light weight moisturizer for year round.</li>
    <li> It leaves my face feeling smooth and fresh - I will continue to buy it since I tried expensive products and they did not improve my skin not even over a long period of time.  This one product has not done a huge improvement either but I can feel my skiing feeling fresh and hydrated as I use it on a daily basis.  Maybe that&#x27;s all I need</li>
    <li> It is just so so. I do not think it is a great moisturizer, but it is OK. It isn&#x27;t about how much you spend because I have tried some cheaper and some more expensive. But I don&#x27;t like to waste money either, and I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Keeps my face hydrated and soft. Light texture, blends in well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to reap the benefits but so far its alright.  I need more time to assess it.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this works great, no breakouts. You only need a little, so it goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I liked it, but it drired my skin for some reason. I love how natural it is, and that is is not cruel to animals...that&#x27;s a must for me. But, I&#x27;ll try another animal cruelty free product which is more hydrated.</li>
    <li> I was told by a friend to try this product, but it is very thick and I&#x27;m just not in love with how it feels on my face.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know, I don&#x27;t use it but my girlfriend does and I think she&#x27;s pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I was very hopeful when I ordered this. I know the reviews are very mixed. People either love it or hate it. I was very disappointed. It left my skin feeling sticky and greasy and I would break out worse than I already do. I have naturally oily skin as it is, but I also need products to help with aging since my skin is loosing its younger capabilities. This line of products does not work for me and I do not recommend it for anyone with oily/combo skin.</li>
    <li> Just tried this product.  First off, the pump didn&#x27;t work, and when I shook the bottle to get contents to the bottom in case it was just an air pocket, the whole bottom popped off, and the lotion went everywhere.  Then I put it on my face, and learned that it is much more of a sunscreen than a moisturizer.  It is so thick and turned my tan face pasty white, with just a tiny dab.  Will definitely be returning this!</li>
    <li> i have used this for a long time but hard to find in stores. i can now order it and get it right to my door! non-greasy and great for dry, sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I bought the entire line of yes to Blueberries because I am a big fan of the other YTC products.  I also turned 31 recently, and that combined with the sale I saw online prompted me to buy this product.  Like with the face wash, this product has a great smell. However, I felt there was a thin film on my face after using it.  I also noticed that my skin gets very oily and shiny quickly when I use this product.  This wasn&#x27;t a common occurrence with other products I had used previously.    I may be \\&quot;too young\\&quot; to be using this line yet.  I wonder how this would work on my skin if I were a few decades older.  Maybe the qualities I do not like in it now are ones I&#x27;d want in the future.  That said, I won&#x27;t buy anything from this line again.  I do think the Yes to Carrots, Yes to Tomatoes, and Yes to Cucumbers lines are wonderful though.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer. Love that its cruelty free.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this stuff, I really did.  I have combination skin (I get greasy around the T-zone) and this moisturizer was way too heavy for me.  It broke me out pretty badly- I usually get one pimple a month (ahem, thank you hormones) but after a few days of using this product I had multiple pimples on both sides of my face- and big, painful ones, at that.  I feel like it should come with free headgear to complete the whole awkward nerd deal, becauthe that would be AWETHUM!</li>
    <li> I purchased this moisturizer because it is free of parabens and other harsh chemicals and is all-natural.  I&#x27;d been experiencing some skin irritations and wanted something gentle, yet moisturizing for my face.  I have been more than pleased with the results.  The moisturizer is both lights and moisturizing, and so far, my skin has been blemish-free.</li>
    <li> great smell, texture. wish it had SPF in it--is its only flaw. but it is quite nourishing and leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 57, so my skin needs this extra thick moisturizer.  I had been using a L&#x27;Oreal product, but every afternoon my eyes burned.  I decided to try this product because of the more organic ingredients and no more burning.  I&#x27;ve seen some of the reviews from younger people that aren&#x27;t crazy about it.  The &#x27;Yes&#x27; products are wonderful, but you need to be sure you are buying the right skin line for you.  The blueberry line isn&#x27;t for prevention, it&#x27;s for those of us that have already reached that mature skin age.</li>
    <li> I know some of the reviews say that when they use this in combination with the Blueberry serum it turns into a sticky mess.  That also happened to me the first time I used them together.  The way to avoid that is to use the serum and then wait about 5 minutes for the serum to absorb and then use the moisturizer...and even then you don&#x27;t need a full pump, maybe 1/2 a pump&#x27;s worth.  I think they work great together.</li>
    <li> What I love most about this product is that it&#x27;s gentle, works great under makeup, and provides sufficient hydration. So if you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizers that provides those attributes -great. If you&#x27;re looking to also minimize pores and the appearance of fine lines, you might want to keep looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past several days and it seems to be a good day cream so far. The amount distributed from the pump is a bit much for my face  as I can&#x27;t seem to rub it all in. It is very moisturizing and has not irritated my sensitive skin. I also use the yes to carrots line- especially their night cream and so far, I think I may prefer the carrots products.</li>
    <li> The benefit of knowing you are doing something for your skin in a more &#x27;natural&#x27; way is so comforting. Great product and well packaged for sending.</li>
    <li> I use most of the &amp;#34;Yes to&amp;#34; products, I LOVE the Yes to Blueberries Daily Repairing Serum, but realized I needed a moisturizer too.  I actually find this a bit heavy for my oily skin, so I started mixing it with the serum, and applying together.  Works like a charm!</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin (and I mean seriously dry skin), this is the best thing out there. I have used so many expensive products that I had to reapply several times throughout the day and they didn&#x27;t do anything great for my skin. This is an AMAZING moisturizer that leaves my skin very soft. What makes it better is that a little goes a very long way. Add in the price, and this product can&#x27;t be beat. I notice after about a week that my skin looked brighter and my dark spots were gone and/or fading. I have been using it now for about a month and I just can&#x27;t get over the difference in how skin looks (without make-up)! I just wish I had tried this sooner and saved myself a lot of money, time, and frustration.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin.  I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars on high priced items claiming to do wonders.  This far exceeds any expectations I could have.  It moisturizes my skin, isn&#x27;t heavy, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and always works.  It is non-irritating and goes on smooth under makeup.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Not oily - very smooth and I will probably buy it again.  Used it alone before starting the night cream and even by itself it worked well</li>
    <li> This does not smell anything like blueberries, I was disappointed with this because I was hoping for the smell of blueberries plus it is pricey for what you get..small tiny bottle , will not get again..</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few years now. I am 40 years old, combination skin that is not too troublesome. I love this moisturizer. I love the way it smells, I love the way it feels on my face, I love the way it makes my skin look! I gave it as a gift to my 60+ year old mother and 80+ year old grandmother, and they both started buying it for themselves! We are all budget shoppers, especially when it comes to splurging on ourselves, yet we consider this well worth the cost. It also lasts much longer than you&#x27;d think, because a little goes a long way. (My 14 year old daughter uses Yes to Cucumbers and that is her favorite. I tried it and didn&#x27;t like it. It is probably formulated for younger skin.) I also love that this product is natural, so I have no reservations about putting it on my face and neck.</li>
    <li> I used to use the Yes to Carrots with sunscreen, but I found the product seemed to heavy, and occasionally exacerbated my infrequent break outs.  This moisturizer feels much lighter and it glides into the skin melting away to a greaseless, soft finish.  It doesn&#x27;t have strong odor (important with anything on my face)  I don&#x27;t wear makeup, but I feel like my face has  little bit of a glow after this moisturizer.  I do wish it was available with a little sunscreen, hence the 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I mix this with a little NOW brand grapeseed oil after I mist my face with flower water and it goes on smooth and creamy. Love the natural ingredients for my very sensitive skin. Very little oily feeling, absorbs well.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this brand but I don&#x27;t really use facial moisturizer so I can&#x27;t really compare it to anything else.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little more money than I want to spend but I know that there are other brands that are crazy expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I use this after washing my face and it really does help during the cold months and prevents my face from feeling dry.</li>
    <li> I chose to rate this product with 5 stars because I&#x27;ve purchased more facial moisturizing products than I can recall, and Yes To Blueberries is by far the best.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for over a year now and it makes my skin feel great and seems to soften the wrinkles.  My face never feels dry like it has with other mositurizers.</li>
    <li> If the weather isn&#x27;t hot and humid, this is great. And I have no problems using it with my peri-oral dermatitis. I just feel like my face feels kind of greasy if I&#x27;m sweating a lot. Love the smell. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Favorite moisturizing &amp; firming cream I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I was looking for a moisturizer that was a little heavier than my day cream and this works.  It goes on moist and penetrates in your skin in a few minutes. Fragance is clean. I also purchased the daily body lotion which I like also.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for people who want to dimish fine lines and wrinkles or just dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love that this is lightweight. I really feel like it improved my skins look and feel. I use ROC products as well at night, but I use this during the day. This is my second time purchasing it. I have seen comments on the smell, I really don&#x27;t have an issue with it. It is a faint scent that disappears after it is rubbed in.</li>
