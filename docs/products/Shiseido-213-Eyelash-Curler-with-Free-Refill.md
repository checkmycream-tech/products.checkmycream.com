      <li>Liked http://www.amazon.com/Tweezerman-1034-P-Classic-Lash-Curler/dp/B00065AS60 better.</li>
      <li>This was the most I have ever paid for an eyelash curler.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lot more curved.</li>
      <li>Before finding this awesome shiseido curler I had tried several others from brands like Kevyn Aucoin, Shuemura and Japonesque and Shiseido topped them all.</li>

      <li>nothing too special about it though.</li>
      <li>It is smaller than most and easy to handle!</li>
      <li>It is worth every penny for me.</li>
      <li>It curls at the right angle and shape.</li>
      <li>They were right.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of different eyelash curlers over the years and love this one.</li>
      <li>perfect for my small asian eyes</li>
      <li>The return was easy enough.</li>
      <li>This was fine, but still left a bit of residue on the corner, as well.  </li>
      <li>This is the real one.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, really, when I ordered a Shiseido Eyelash Curler.  </li>
      <li>Not as much, though.</li>
      <li>and the curler has been working very well on them.</li>
      <li>better than most curlers that i&#x27;ve used, but not perfect.</li>
      <li>but I was expecting it to be similar to the ones bought from the Shiseido counter where it was more flat than curved.</li>
      <li>i bought used-good as new and it does its purpose.</li>
      <li>No spring action at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m returning this and going back to Nordstroms to get the real thing.</li>
      <li>This one is silver, very curved, and not much different than the $5 one you can get at the drug store.  </li>
      <li>I like that it actually curls my straight short eyelashes without pinching my hooded lids.  </li>
      <li>It really works for Asian eyelash, which makes short eyelash curling well.</li>
      <li>I have very short Asian straight lashes and this curler</li>
      <li>I have very stubborn Asian eyelashes (grows straight down)</li>
      <li>The packaging is different from the one that I got when I bought this at a Sephora store in the US, but this thing curls just like my old Shiseido curler!&lt;br</li>

<li> I had bought a Shiseido eyelash curler from a Shiseido make-up counter at Nordstroms and it fits wonderfully on my flat Asian eyes.  </li>
<li> I previously had a Shiseido and this one is not like the old one at all.  </li>
<li> They grab the lashes at the base without pinching my eyelid and curl my short, straight eyelashes better than other curlers I have owned.</li>
<li> This one has the proper wide shape for a close to the lash curl.  </li>
<li> Now that I&#x27;ve purchased cheaper of multiple different curler that all seems to leave a black eyeliner to mascara residue on my corner area of the eye, I think I will fork the buck and buy it.  </li>
<li> I should of invested in this curler a long time ago!</li>
<li> Mine was black and came in a different packaging.  </li>
<li> no better and much more expensive than the drugstore version.  </li>
<li> I find all other curlers are hard to position near my eyes.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not economically feasible to return lots of things on Amazon, so I just threw it out and went to Macy&#x27;s to get one.  </li>
<li> /&gt;The one I got was silver-colored with a black pad.  </li>
<li> Less pinching.</li>
<li> I usually just pick one up at the store for about 5 dollars.  </li>
<li> Maybe from china the spring sucks on it and does not curl your eyelashes, it pulls them out.</li>
<li> Bought a less expensive shies idol eyelash curler</li>
<li> no free refill in the box...!!!</li>
<li> So Disappointed.</li>
<li> disappointed...</li>

    <li> Best eye lash curler!</li>
    <li> Works great. Fast shipping. Just as described.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, really, when I ordered a Shiseido Eyelash Curler.  I usually just pick one up at the store for about 5 dollars.  This was the most I have ever paid for an eyelash curler.  I think it works well.  But, not 3 times better!  So, I will give it 4 stars. Thank you.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST EYELASH CURLER EVER.  ARRIVED SOONER THAN ANTICIPATED.  VERY PLEASED. IT ALSO CAME WITH A FREE REFILL.</li>
    <li> This is the real one. Bought a less expensive shies idol eyelash curler and it must have been a knock off. This one has the proper wide shape for a close to the lash curl.  The best eyelash curler out there. Will never be with out it.</li>
    <li> Returned, this is not an original Shiseido eyelash curler, very cheaply made.  Maybe from china the spring sucks on it and does not curl your eyelashes, it pulls them out.</li>
    <li> Works well with my Asian lashes.  I find all other curlers are hard to position near my eyes.  Once I found a curler that faced the opposite direction of most, and this worked the best.  But I could never find it again.</li>
    <li> I think it is important to consider your eyeshape before buying an eyelash curler. Before finding this awesome shiseido curler I had tried several others from brands like Kevyn Aucoin, Shuemura and Japonesque and Shiseido topped them all. I have quite flat eyes who are slightly hooded, so similiar to an Asian Eye, and if we share the same eyeshape, I would highly recommend to buy the Shiseido Lash Curler.</li>
    <li> Liked http://www.amazon.com/Tweezerman-1034-P-Classic-Lash-Curler/dp/B00065AS60 better. Less pinching. Wider almond shaped eye.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my fiancee, and she likes it a lot. It does a good job curling, doesn&#x27;t break eyelashes, and feels good in the hand.</li>
    <li> This eye lash curler is the best. It is smaller than most and easy to handle!</li>
    <li> Basic lash curler. Gets all the way to roots.</li>
    <li> I was worried that I would get a knock-off eyelash curler, but that was not the case.  The packaging is different from the one that I got when I bought this at a Sephora store in the US, but this thing curls just like my old Shiseido curler!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one I got was silver-colored with a black pad.  (I had an all black-colored one before from the store.)</li>
    <li> I had bought a Shiseido eyelash curler from a Shiseido make-up counter at Nordstroms and it fits wonderfully on my flat Asian eyes.  I got this one for a friend and it is NOT anything like the one I bought at Nordstroms.  Mine was black and came in a different packaging.  This one is silver, very curved, and not much different than the $5 one you can get at the drug store.  I&#x27;m returning this and going back to Nordstroms to get the real thing.</li>
    <li> My new favorite eyelash curler! I have very stubborn Asian eyelashes (grows straight down) and the curler has been working very well on them. I should of invested in this curler a long time ago!</li>
    <li> Not a fan.  Bought this instead of having to go out to the Department Store to get one and it was too rigid and felt like it would rip my eyelashes off.  It&#x27;s not economically feasible to return lots of things on Amazon, so I just threw it out and went to Macy&#x27;s to get one.  So Disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is the best curler I have ever owned. They grab the lashes at the base without pinching my eyelid and curl my short, straight eyelashes better than other curlers I have owned.</li>
    <li> Quite flimsy.  Didn&#x27;t curly my lashes well at all. Feels almost as if the mechanism isn&#x27;t working.  No spring action at all. I previously had a Shiseido and this one is not like the old one at all.  Quite disappointed.</li>
    <li> better than most curlers that i&#x27;ve used, but not perfect.</li>
    <li> It really works for Asian eyelash, which makes short eyelash curling well.</li>
    <li> Much better than the revlon curler I was using! Glad I splurged a bit!</li>
    <li> It is a nice eyelash curler. Nice.</li>
    <li> I have very short Asian straight lashes and this curler seems to do the job.  It curls at the right angle and shape.</li>
    <li> no free refill in the box...!!! is this used one or what ??? disappointed...</li>
    <li> It fits the curve of my eyelid well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different eyelash curlers over the years and love this one. My two daughters were always using mine so they each had one in their stockings!</li>
    <li> perfect for my small asian eyes</li>
    <li> its good! i bought used-good as new and it does its purpose. nothing too special about it though.</li>
    <li> I like that it actually curls my straight short eyelashes without pinching my hooded lids.  Works best heated slightly with my hair dryer,  after application of mascara.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have short lashes and a friend told me that this product would work well.  They were right.  I would recommend this curler for anyone who has short lashes.</li>
    <li> Best eyelash curler that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I kept hearing about Shu Umera(?) brand for eyelash curler since everyone raved about it.  Yet, when I saw the price, I couldn&#x27;t get myself to buy one.  Now that I&#x27;ve purchased cheaper of multiple different curler that all seems to leave a black eyeliner to mascara residue on my corner area of the eye, I think I will fork the buck and buy it.  This was fine, but still left a bit of residue on the corner, as well.  Not as much, though.</li>
    <li> One of the best curlers I&#x27;ve used and my lashes stay curled . Liked it so much I ordered another .</li>
    <li> It is not the same as the one you get from a Shiseido counter at Macy&#x27;s. It&#x27;s a lot more curved. It works fine for my lashes but I was expecting it to be similar to the ones bought from the Shiseido counter where it was more flat than curved.</li>
    <li> this is so good!!! love it so much!!!</li>
    <li> Great curler! I don&#x27;t wear mascara and this curler makes my eyes pop. I like that it comes with a refill. It is worth every penny for me.</li>
    <li> no better and much more expensive than the drugstore version.  The return was easy enough.</li>
