<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product and hope I can find it again when I&#x27;m out. It&#x27;s so much easier to order it from Amazon than to try and find a store that carries it.</li>
    <li> The service was prompt, and the product smells good and leaves your skin delightfully smooth!  It is wonderful - it reminded me of a sea salt scrub I had used in a German sauna.</li>
    <li> Works just as it says it will. Lightly scented with an ocean fragrance. Not fruity or flowery, just a nice clean clean aroma.</li>
    <li> This is the first product of this kind I have ever used so I lack basis for comparison. During transit the oil separates from the salt and after opening the product I used a spoon to stir it up. I bathed first and then used this product. The salt abrasion is nice and helps rejuvenate tired skin, but I was initially alarmed at how oily I felt. The scent is very mild and pleasant, much like I remember the ocean being. After toweling off, the oily feeling went away and all evening my skin felt hydrated and very soft. Usually with just about any soap my skin becomes very dry after I bathe and I have to use lotion often. With this product my skin never felt dry and all the next day I felt more comfortable and scent does not linger. I would say that for people who dislike feeling greasy but want the salt scrub, use this product first and then bathe regularly to remove the oil. Lastly, be careful when using this product in the shower because if you do the bottoms of your feet the residual oil may cause the stall to become very slippery. I did not fall myself and would try to spare others injury. Overall though I like this scrub and plan to use it weekly.</li>
    <li> I was sold this scrub by an incredibly pushy, but persuasive salesman at a mall. After I walked away I felt I had been swindled, but the only swindling was that I paid about $60 for a product that I could have bought on the internet for $18. This product is amazing. I have had years and years of problems with eczema and have used steroid creams for many years to maintain my skin at a barely acceptable level and now after using this scrub along with their lotion my skin is smooth and my eczema is gone. I know this sounds hard to believe, but it is really true. I have been using the scrub for about a month.</li>
    <li> LOL..just like one of the review , i was at the mall when the saleslady grabbed my hand and had me try the scrub. I really didnt want to buy the product but since i told her i was a student at a school next to the mall and had just came back from vacation and that i am a little bit broke she offered me a 10$ discount, for 39.99 plus tax 42.and change i got the scrub ( in kiwi ) the shea butter cream and the nail filling thing ( idk what its called , but its the one that has 4 steps and at the end makes your nails shiny ) so over all 3 for that much that was a great deal. she forced me so bad that i said ok.. I ll take it but im sure its going to be another thing that will not work and just sit in my bathroom. so i decided that i would give it away as a gift instead.. But yesterday, i had a little date with a special someone ( lol blushing ) and decided to , hey why not.. soooo i took a shower and scrub my whole body , used the cream after boy my body was so soft...and when my special person was feeling my legs , he said wow ur legs are soft...and now i am at work , i just touched my arm, my stomach wow  still soft, so im guessing i will be doing this once or twice a week, im in love....hopefully when i ran out of the scrub i will still find this great deal , if not i ll just get it here at Amazon,</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. They sell something similar in the mall but this stuff is just as good if not better.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t care for the smell it is too strong it has a flower fragrance but it seems to work fine.</li>
    <li> the smell is just an added and very delightful bonus... the real thrill comes from the smooth and supple feeling this scrub gives my old tired and very dry skin!</li>
    <li> Like everyone else here I got grabbed by a sales guy at the mall and the dude knew what he was doing. I nearly walked away but he threw in some free stuff which made the deal better then what I could get here on Amazon. I usually say no to this type of thing but lets just say I was in a mood where I didn&#x27;t care and wanted to pamper myself. Still, I walked away cringing at the high price tag even though my bag was heavy with products. I went home and tried and O.M.G. this stuff is beyond description. I always made my own scrubs but this took it to a whole other level. Your skin is crazy soft when done. We&#x27;re talking baby&#x27;s bottom soft here. The best part is the today, the next day, and I&#x27;m still petting my skin marveling over how soft it still feels. I&#x27;ve never had that before with my own scrubs. I also got the moisturizer with the scrub and for as little as you use, it&#x27;s a great deal. I&#x27;m hoping i&#x27;ll be able to stick with this because of how I feel right now which is gorgeous and soft and everything a woman wants to feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great by the way. I suffer from migraines and strong scents will get one started every time. This one is light but fragrant and it stays with you. No headaches which means its a keeper. It is expensive, no doubt about it, but the quality and results is undeniable.</li>
    <li> Like a lot or reviewers I got stopped while in the mall.  I was blown away how soft my skin was after the demonstration and decided to spend the money and buy the combo (the scrub and butter).  It is very pricey, so make sure to pay attention to the price, because that is the last thing they tell you.&lt;br /&gt;I used the scrub at home and it leaves my skin smooth and soft, the water just pearls of my skin in the shower and I like the smell.  I then follow up with the butter and it keeps my skin soft from the beginning of the day until the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every once in a while my sisters and I will get together and have a spa day.  I always liked how soft and smooth my skin was after the massage and treatment I choose.  Now I can have the same at home after I get out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much I went back to the mall and bought the combo as a gift for my sisters.</li>
    <li> Better than Proactive or any acne medication, Obey Your Body Dead Sea Mineral Scrub is positively the best thing I&#x27;ve ever applied to heal my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The product, overall, is great!  My advice to everyone is NOT to buy this from a dealer at the mall.  I was approached by a dealer and he wanted to give me a special deal of $49.99 instead of the original price of $69.99. Because I deal with salespeople on a daily basis per my job, I knew his tactics and was able to get him to give me a &amp;#34;Managers Discount&amp;#34; of $30.00.  If you don&#x27;t know how to deal with the mall salesmen, don&#x27;t attempt to haggle with them.  You&#x27;d be better off buying online.&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, I love this product, it leaves my skin very smooth and soft.  You don&#x27;t need to use much to get the benefits, so I estimate this jar could last up to 6 months (if used sparingly). If you can spare the cost, and want something that&#x27;ll cleanse your skin and make it super soft, give this a go.</li>
    <li> I started looking for a salt scrub product when i had learned that salt scrubs help with post pregnancy skin. I had my first child, and my stomach although i lost the weight i still felt my stomach looked a little saggy. I learned that salt scrubs worked to help with this and so i started the hunt. i got this product about a week ago and have only used it about 4 times, and all i have to say is... wow! it is amazing and does help so much with the appearance of your stomach. and i use it all over as well and my skin has never felt softer, and i am a lotion addict. but all the lotions dont compare. MUST have for all women.</li>
    <li> Do yourself a real favor (man or woman) and try this product.  Not only am I hooked but both of my daughter-in-laws and one of my sons are now devoted fans as well.  As well as a wonderful cleanser it leaves yours skin silky smooth (not oily).  I prefer the Ocean Fragrance.  Very light.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin smooth and soft. I love the fragrance too.</li>
    <li> Product delivered fairly quick, I like this product, it helped my skin look better, I wish it were a little less expensive.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff and was cheaper than buying it in the mall</li>
    <li> I use this twice weekly for baby soft even toned skin. Rarely do I find a product that is a must and makes such a drastic noticeable difference. It really does do what they say it does. It exfoliates your skin and moisturizes. I find it unessesary to use moisturizer after I use it. It also got rid of my &amp;#34;sun fungus&amp;#34; on my arms. I had dry patches of skin on my arms from sun exposure and it totally healed it and never came back. Now I have beautiful even toned skin. This will make your akin feel silky soft and even out skin tone. I even use it on my face which is not recommended but have found that it brightens my complexion and makes my skin glow like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its on my CANT LIVE WITHOUT LIST&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful product. The kiwi scent is my favorite.</li>
    <li> At work I was talking to the manager of the Obey Your Body booth and was offered a sample of the Scrub. After rubbing it all over my hands I instantly felt my skin feel softer and hydrated. Working in retail, my hands get very dry and my hands stayed soft and moist for over 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I was told by the manager not to rub it on my face, but it works everywhere else on my body. I tried my feet and it feels like I&#x27;m walking on silk. I do recommend atleast trying out the product because you will feel a difference, makes a great gift too.</li>
    <li> I always buy Obey when I can- It always makes you feel great! Fabulous salt scrub! I Love, Love, Love it!</li>
    <li> A must-have for anyone who wants to improve the health of their skin.  I use it an average of twice per week.  For best results, I apply it/scrub it into my skin in the shower BEFORE I turn the water on - this insures that you&#x27;re getting maximum exfoliation and results (remember it&#x27;s made with dead sea salt/minerals, which will melt and rinse away in warm water).  Use it sparingly - the jar will last quite a while. The salt scrub also has emollients in it so when you rinse off, you&#x27;ll feel the oils on your skin, and that&#x27;s intentional.  I follow up with the Ocean scent body butter from the same brand.  This is really the best I&#x27;ve tried and highly recommend it for yourself or as a gift.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin. I also have eczema on the palm of my left hand. NOTHING has helped until I put OBEY YOUR BODY body butter on it.</li>
    <li> Product is perfect honestly get rid of all the dead akin and feels great leaves skin a little read but after the shower u can come out with soft skin love it thank u will buy again</li>
    <li> I got this to help with some unsightly stretch marks. After a month the marks definitely appear softer. This stuff smells good and it leaves your skin feeling great.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!!! And thank the good Lord above for Amazon! Buying this through a vendor would cost you a fortune. Price on Amazon is a fraction of the cost and money well spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t rave enough about the Obey Your Body products. They have been amazing for my skin! Use them in combo with Vivo products for my face and you can definitely notice the improvement in my complexion and clarity of my skin. I also have two pre-teen kids who use these products and their skin has drastically improved. No more acne! Thank you to the makers of this line of products!!</li>
    <li> YES IT IS SO FUNNY I TOO WAS AT THE MALL AND THE SALES LADY WANTED ME TO PAY 140 USDFOR THE BUTTER AND SCRUB....THEN I AGREED TO PAY 70 FOR BOTH....WE GOT PLAYED ..LOL...SHE TOLD ME TO DRAIN THE LIQUID OF FRO THE SCRUB JAR BUT THE LIQUID IS SO RICH AND MOIST.....I CAN&#x27;T DO IT</li>
    <li> I was laughing in reading some of the other reviews when I was shopping for this product. I had a very similar experience with a pushy saleswoman in the mall. She even lowered the price to get me to buy it. (Still way more that what I paid for it on Amazon.) But after the product sat on my shelf for maybe close to year, I said the the hell with it. I own it, I may as well try it. And it&#x27;s amazing! I&#x27;m a little OCD &amp; I wash my hands a lot, so they get pretty dry in the winter. And this stuff works wonders! I also recommend getting the body butter to accompany the salt scrub, it makes your skin even softer.</li>
    <li> Caution to all Migrainers...  For those sensitive to fragrance, I would not recommend this product.  Regardless of the attributes, it gave me a headache within minutes of using it.  I tried in vain to scrub it off, but was not successful.   If I am going to suffer through a headache, I will enjoy a delicious chocolate ganache, not a body scrub.  I dare say if this were the scent of the ocean, there would be little sea life.</li>
    <li> Haha! I did have a good giggle reading some reviews about how some people got acquained with this product! I too was approached by a sales person who was persistent in me trying out this exfoliator..well I had a little time to spare so why not! I suffer from dry skin on my hands as I work in the hospital that requires me to wash them constantly, and further more - alcohol wipe them which strips all essential moisturising oils from the epidermis. Left with flaky skin, I have a hard time hydrating and getting rid of dead skin cells, and by which they look unsightly.  I must admit, when I tried this product the results were amazing! Never have I felt my hands so soft, and literally 97% of the dead skin was removed! I told the sales person I#ll go away and think about it, but he bought the price down from £35 to £25, then to £20 as he used his manager&#x27;s discretion. So...I bought it! Funny, I only wanted to buy a pair of shoes, and I left with a beauty product instead...but I think it&#x27;s worth the investment!</li>
    <li> I think at this point, this I am on my 3rd jar.  Makes you skins so soft and feels wonderful.  I once tried a different brand that was on sale in a local store, not the same, went back on Amazon and ordered my 2nd jar, and knew to stick with what was the best.</li>
    <li> My wife and sisters rave about how soft and clean their skin feels after using this scrub. It also smells beautiful and feminine. There simply is no other product that does what this can. It&#x27;s truly invigorating and the way it boosts her self-esteem is worth it alone.&lt;br /&gt;I also can&#x27;t say enough good things about Brand Warehouse. There was an unfortunate shipping error (it happens) and they resolved it with a rush delivery I received in 2 days. Then by no fault of theirs, the product was damaged and leaked through the box. I simply sent an email and Brand Warehouse had a replacement in the mail for me. They were courteous, professional and prompt. Just what I hope for when I use Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the product as well as the supplier. Great service.</li>
    <li> Scent is strong at first but disipates quickly, leaves skin silky and refreshed, once a week treatment is all you need, a definant must-have</li>
    <li> This product has a nice scent.  However, it does leave a sticky feel to your skin after use.  Not as good of a scrub as I have used in the past.  You will need to use a soap or body wash afterwards.</li>
    <li> Thank You.  this is the best cleanser I have ever used.  I love the way it makes my body feel, it leaves my skin feeling so clean, and soft. and it has a clean smell not a heavy perfume. I will continue to purchase as long as it is being sold</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the vendor this one is coming from, but it&#x27;s waaaay too oily &amp; makes me itch afterwards. When I opened the package the jar was covered in oil. Nothing like the one in the mall at all. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> We went to a local mall and we all know wht happens when you make eye contact with one of kiosks well they convinced us to buy and then later we were looking at Amazon and realized the exact same product was hugely cheaper from Amazon it works great making y hand smooth I work in health care and between hand washing and the alcohol gel my hands get so dried and itchy from dry skin this stuff at bed time just makes my hands feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My greatest advice is when you see a great product pull out the smart phone and find out if you are really getting a good deal.</li>
    <li> I love this scrub.  The smell is very pleasant but not overwhelming.  It has made my skin soft and supple.  I will ordering this body scrub again once I run out.</li>
    <li> The best body scrub ever hands down. My dad got stopped by a salesperson in the mall and gave me the purchase. My skin is baby soft after using it once! I use on my legs after shaving bc I like the oils to stay on my skin. I suppose you could use it before and after you shave for better exfoliation but I get no shave bumps or razor burn. I have pretty sensitive skin and this has been a miracle product! Smells so fresh as well great buy</li>
    <li> Recomended AAAA +++++++</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before. Love the scent, only thing is, be very careful in shower as it get very slippery!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for the body. Avoid using it on face. I could see dirt drip from my hands after I washed with this product. I would recommend alternate day use as too much of scrubbing is bad for the skin I guess.</li>
    <li> I love the Dead Sea products they make you look younger and you know how lotions feel wet these products make you skin so soft and you see some results the first time you use it. My feet and finger nails usually are sore and cracking after you use it starts healing.</li>
    <li> A little to thin. Not a real manly product. Feels greasy after application. I wish it were a little thicker.</li>
    <li> This scrub works wonders.  It removes the dead skin and leaves your hand silky smooth.  It works better if you let your hand air dry after rinsing.  Of course it won&#x27;t last all day but it definitely improves your skin with daily use.</li>
    <li> This product smells wonderful and makes your skin feel great!&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my hands the most often.  I have used it on my feet elbows and legs as well.</li>
    <li> Was a great scrub and amazing smell! Left my skin smooth and dead skin free. The smell on this is nothing like the lotion.</li>
    <li> This is just what I wanted and I am pleased with the product and would order again as I am a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Works great,smells nice</li>
    <li> Smell great. Feel like silky after using it.</li>
    <li> I love YourBody products.  The scrub leaves your skin feeling baby smooth.</li>
    <li> Its a good body scrub but the oils in the dead sea companies dead sea scrub are more nourishing and longer lasting but like always price was decent and shipment was fast</li>
    <li> My sister and I have tried several Obey Your Body products and really love them as they do make your skin feel really good. However, do not be fooled by kiosk salespeople, as they will tell you anything to get you to buy their over-priced products on the spot. You can purchase all these wonderful products from Amazon at a fraction of the kiosk price.</li>
    <li> I use this especially in the winter. It keeps my skin so soft and my heals don&#x27;t crack and i&#x27;m 60 yrs old. It smells great as well. I would recommend this product to all who want to keep there skin soft.</li>
    <li> Great price, arrived on time, well packed. This product is consistently well made. They must have strict production guidelines. Bravo!</li>
    <li> I love the product and the sent that this product has.  Have recommended it to family and friends.  Glad I was able to find this product on line.</li>
