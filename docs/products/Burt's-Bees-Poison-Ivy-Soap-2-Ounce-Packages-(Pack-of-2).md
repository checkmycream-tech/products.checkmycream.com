      <li>We are glad to now have it on hand because it is critical that you start use ASAP....</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve ordered this many times because this is the only thing that works.</li>

      <li>I live in an area where poison oak spreads everywhere.</li>
      <li>It stinks but works great</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t had any issues so far this year.  </li>
      <li>and it really surprised me.</li>
      <li>Like i said, its not a miracle and makes the itch completely go away everywhere.</li>
      <li>If I wash using this soap right away I usually get no infection.</li>
      <li>I had two days of heavy weeding to prep my large garden area and rinsed off every 30 minutes with this soap.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My job has me walking around in fields a lot.  Last year I got poison ivy quite a lot.  Friend tipped me off to this stuff and I use it now after every day I&#x27;m out there.  Haven&#x27;t had any issues so far this year.  Not the cheapest but seems to work and hold to it&#x27;s promise.  Not a pleasant scent but not bad either.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re planning to buy this to keep on hand \\&quot;just in case\\&quot;, then I suggest that you store it in two layers of freezer bags. It&#x27;s not a terrible smell. It kind of reminds me of a campfire. But... it will stink up everything that you keep in the cabinet with it. That said, it&#x27;s totally worth it to have it on hand when you need it. I&#x27;ve been a hero to two people so far by being able to produce this stuff immediately when the itching started.</li>
    <li> Many a time while working outside I&#x27;ve been accidentally exposed to Poison Ivy. If I wash using this soap right away I usually get no infection. If I do it&#x27;s very minimal. If you work outside in the garden you need to keep a bar of this soap on hand.</li>
    <li> First of all, this two pack was a great deal and delivered quickly. Couldn&#x27;t find it in a couple stores that carry Burt&#x27;s Bees products so my wife was two days into the outbreak before first use of the soap. We are glad to now have it on hand because it is critical that you start use ASAP....start using it if you even think you&#x27;ve been in poison ivy or oak to prevent the oils from being absorbed or spreading. Gave temporary relief, perhaps helped prevent spread, but the existing outbreak pretty much ran it&#x27;s course.</li>
    <li> Seemed to work great and didnt stink to high heavn like so many others.  This is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Works great - after any work in yard, I use this soap and it prevents alot of discomfort on arms and legs...I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> Great shipping, great price, good service  had poison ivy, help make it feel better and go away  will use now if I think I have come in contact with poison ivy</li>
    <li> It stinks but works great</li>
    <li> I bought this to see if it worked as well as other products and it really surprised me. Natural is good!</li>
    <li> This soap is good for a variety of skin conditions - not just poison ivy.  It is a mild yet healing soap.</li>
    <li> My mom and sister love this stuff, I&#x27;ve ordered this many times because this is the only thing that works.</li>
    <li> Being that this stuff is fairly cheap, as compared to medicinal remedies than can cost up to $40. On the packaging it says nothing about how to use it. But on burts bees website it tells you. Just make sure you wash all over with it once, then rinse off like normal. Then lather up again and don&#x27;t rinse. Just let it dry on you. I didn&#x27;t do that the first time and it didn&#x27;t help much at all. The 2nd time i saw how to actually use it and it works Much better. Like i said, its not a miracle and makes the itch completely go away everywhere. But i am covered head to toe in poison ivy right now and for some reason only in between my fingers are itchy. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I recommend this to all gardeners.....I wash with it during and after working in the yard as well as on any outbreaks of poison ivy when I forget to wash soon enough or am away from home (though I try to keep a box in the car when traveling).</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees for poison ivy soap is a life send to keep the irritation from spreading until the infection has fully cleared. I would search everywhere just to find this product during poison ivy season. I love it and can&#x27;t live happily without it.</li>
    <li> Local Source dried up, Amazon came through, great product.  Works every time when others fail. Great to know a future source exists.</li>
    <li> My property is wooded and is loaded with Poison Ivy.  Last year as careful as I tried I continued to get afflicted.  I heard about Burt&#x27;s Bees soap and purchased seven bars online (seven bars because it was cheaper that way).&lt;br /&gt;I showered as normal with my normal soap then drip dried a bit while doing a few stretches.  I&#x27;d would then lather up the Bert&#x27;s Bees Soap and  cover my entire body with a thin film and let it dry.  Last year, I did this almost every day during the summer and fall since I walk my property every day. I never got Poison Ivy again.&lt;br /&gt;This year as spring came and the Poison Ivy began to grow I noticed that I no longer needed Burt&#x27;s Bees soap.  Now I walk right through the poison ivy without using Burt&#x27;s bees soap with no reaction whatsoever.  I have six bars left that I no longer need!!!&lt;br /&gt;BTW, it also works great after you&#x27;ve gotten Poison Ivy (better than anything else I tried).  But why get it at all?  Soap up BEFORE going out into areas where poison ivy may be.</li>
    <li> It works!  I dries the rash up and helps to keep the itchiness down and cuts the run time.  The two bars package was a pretty good deal!</li>
    <li> Good service, great product. Being surrounded by poison ivy &amp; having a dog who likes to track it in, I use this throughout the day &amp; it really helps. Have been a fan for a number of years.</li>
    <li> Good product. Poison Ivy disappeared after applying for a few days.</li>
    <li> one of the best soaps to deter that nasty poison.  I started using it last year and absolutely no poison.  Works great!</li>
    <li> I live in an area where poison oak spreads everywhere. While I try to contain as much as possible, I bought this soap after reading many positive reviews. I had two days of heavy weeding to prep my large garden area and rinsed off every 30 minutes with this soap. Long story short: poison oak spread so bad that I needed a 2-week pack of steroids.  The doctor thinks that by washing/rinsing with this soap all day that it actually helped to spread it.  I will try a different brand next time. Very disappointed because this company has a good reputation.</li>
    <li> I found this and had to have my husband try it since he gets poison ivy so bad every year. The smell isn&#x27;t the best. It hasn&#x27;t stopped him from getting it but does help in not getting it as bad</li>
    <li> I hear great things about this product, now I almost want the kids to get poison ivy to try it our....ALMOST!!</li>
    <li> Always have this bar of soap on hand to use after weed eating or working around wooded areas.  It really does work.</li>
    <li> My whole family uses this when we go out on the wild parts of our land.I am really allergic to posion oak. I can get a rash just by touching their clothes that may have their oils on it. I have tried other lotions and soaps, but this is what helps me the most._t dries it out for me and keeps it from getting bad.because we all use it, I like buying in bulk, I like this company&#x27;s service and price.</li>
    <li> Burts Bees Poison Ivy Soap has saved me from going to the DR with Poison Ivy several times.</li>
    <li> We LOVE this product to relieve poison ivy rash itching.  It dries out the blisters and really makes you feel a little better.  I also use really really hot water and that seems to help as well.  I carry it with me and use throughout the day to relieve itching if I have it on my arms/hands.  I prefer doing this to using a cream... less messy.  I don&#x27;t believe it says it can deter poison ivy or poison ivy rash.  I would recommend a TechNu wash for that.</li>
