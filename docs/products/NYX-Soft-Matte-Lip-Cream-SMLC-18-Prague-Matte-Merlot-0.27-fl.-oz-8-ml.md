      <li>Pleased to say I will be buying from you from now on.</li>
      <li>I love everything about it.</li>
      <li>I actually enjoy it more than my Lime Crime lip stick (which isn&#x27;t cheap!)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful, deep rosy mauve color that looks stunning in the matte finish.</li>

      <li>The best part is that it&#x27;s long lasting AND not drying (not common for a matte, ladies!)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Prettiest shade! This lippy is bright but not overbearing, perf for fall and summer!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite lippies. This color is to die for, I now own them all. Most definitely recommend this NYX lippie. In any shade ;)</li>
    <li> This lip cream is amazing!!</li>
    <li> Best thing ever made by NYX I recomend this to anyone how likes matte look I used it for work and it last for 10 hours without adding another layer!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color ,creamy  dark purple mauve . Loved it</li>
    <li> Nice coverage.  Beautiful color.</li>
    <li> Color is perfect on my fair skin. It goes on glossy and creamy and then dries matte. And it stays on all night and even while you eat. I will buy more colors</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with lipstick and lip gloss where it constantly rubs off or collects on my bottom lip into a weird paste and I have to reapply it like 5 times throughout the day. I decided to try this because the reviews were really good. It was easy to apply and I was so impressed with the color. It looks exactly like the tube. Most lipsticks don&#x27;t match the color of the tube at all and it&#x27;s really disappointing. I was also really surprised that I only had to reapply once, and it was after I ate. It didn&#x27;t even really come off after eating, either, I just touched it up a little. I really recommend this to anyone who has had issues with finding a good lipstick in the past.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s matte, heavily pigmented and so pretty! This would be great for so many skin tones too! I have a medium/warm tone and this looks so flowery and pretty.</li>
    <li> Slimy &amp; not long lasting</li>
    <li> Love this. Stays on all day unless you eat or something, then you would need to reapply. Its not drying like the NYX tokyo matte lip cream is. You dont need any lip gloss or anything over it. Its a deep burgundy-purple.</li>
    <li> prettiest lip color on me, i usually go for darker reds and saw this and thought how pretty. It really softens up my look, and its pretty easy to apply</li>
    <li> love this lipstick. a girls best friend 👄💋</li>
    <li> I love NYX Matte Cream line. I love how it&#x27;s creamy but still maintains the matte effect. It&#x27;s not quite on the same level as a lip stain, but it definitely has a good lasting power and stains your lips to a certain degree. I had Copenhagen and Athens before I bought this (very dark and very light) and this is nice medium. It&#x27;s bold, but I do not feel crazy wearing it to work. It bleeds, so make sure to wear lip liner and check your teeth before and after each application.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s my favorite cream lipstick, it has a matte finish but it&#x27;s smooth, not too dry and very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Last long doesnt rub off once set</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this color, and hope that NYX keeps making it. It&#x27;s a beautiful, deep rosy mauve color that looks stunning in the matte finish. It looks so velvety and rich. In my experience, all matte lip colors are a little drying - some more than others. This one is slightly drying, but really not much. I put a light layer of EOS lip balm on before applying the matte lip cream, and did not have a problem with drying, cracking lips. I will definitely be buying this shade again...it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Great long lasting matted product!  The color is more on the fuchsia side than berry.... but is still quite pretty.</li>
    <li> Love these so so much!</li>
    <li> Nice colour, doesn&#x27;t last very long but I didn&#x27;t expect it to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this almost everyday!! I loveee it !!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Great color and the application is like velvet!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing the color is great. It stay on&lt;br /&gt;All day and you need to get some.</li>
    <li> GREAT PIGMENTATION AND SMELLS DELICIOUS!</li>
    <li> Love love love these. So pretty I am one happy girl :)</li>
    <li> its a nice color and goes on smooth</li>
    <li> Looks great. Feels great. Smells great. Would buy again</li>
    <li> If you are considering getting this then it&#x27;s a must! I actually enjoy it more than my Lime Crime lip stick (which isn&#x27;t cheap!) It&#x27;s very wearable, I received so many compliments on it. The best part is that it&#x27;s long lasting AND not drying (not common for a matte, ladies!)</li>
    <li> Get your favorite chapstick, Burts Bees, whatever... On my lips it was a little drying. I probably annoyed the heck outta my co-workers, because it didn&#x27;t FEEL like anything was there. (Aside from the dry lip feeling.) I work graveyard. I wake up around midnight, makeup applied around 12:30 or so. From then until I got off at 10am, and then passed out from exhaustion as soon as I got home, violating the cardinal &amp;#34;don&#x27;t fall asleep with makeup on&amp;#34; rule. I woke up yo raccoon eyes, crusty lashes, and perfect lips at one in the afternoon. I ate with this stuff, chugged energy drinks with this stuff, talked all night with this stuff, and at one in the afternoon, the color wasn&#x27;t as pigmented, but it was STILL there. Beat THAT, over-priced cosmetic companies!</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t own this you need to! It is the perfect bright maroon color! Pigment is crazy and its smell is like fresh vanilla and cookies! Will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> I absolutely Love it !!</li>
    <li> I have wanted to try this out forever and finally broke down and bought it. I am soooo glad that I did. I love everything about it. I found it super easy to apply with the doe tip applicator. I thought it would smear and be messy but it really didn&#x27;t. I got it on perfectly even in one try. The color is also gorgeous. It looks a little brighter and more pink on my lips than I though it would be but still nice. It is like a bright magenta. The formula is so much more creamy than I thought it would be too.  It does not feel drying, or sticky on my lips at all. The only downside is that it will wipe./kiss off your lips. I thought it would dry to a more colorsafe finish like a stain. Really that&#x27;s not a big deal to me just thought it was worth mentioning. Overall, I love this product and I will definitely be buying tons more colors.</li>
    <li> Love this shade &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> My favorite! My favoriteeeee I love this lip cream. It does take a few minutes to turn completely matte but when it does become matte it&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous. You should buy</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these NYX lip cremes. It was a little lighter than I thought it would be, but it&#x27;s still gorgeous. The cremes stay a long time, but are a bit drying. (What can you expect out of a matte lip product anyway) I would definitely make this purchase again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! The color is so vivid and flattering on practically any complexion! It stays on too; I ate an apple while wearing it and it looked just as good as it did when I put it on! It is slightly drying but not as much as most mattes. Now I kind of want to try out the other colors in the collection.</li>
    <li> Great product. Was sealed when delivered but there seem to be less product in the bottle than normal.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful color, not as dark as I expected though which was kind of disappointing but it&#x27;s still really pretty. Don&#x27;t buy this color if you are expecting a deep dark red/purple/pink.</li>
    <li> Works well nice creamy Matt finish. At this price it is worth trying</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with the way this color looks, it&#x27;s a bright red, but it isn&#x27;t too crazy. And the soft matte just makes it even better.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this lip cream, love the wand it comes with makes for a nice even application, the color is beautiful although it&#x27;s a bright fuchsia color, if it&#x27;s too bright for you that is an easy fix, take a black eyeliner (not waterproof) and line your lips with it then with your finger or lip brush fade it in towards your mouth then put the lip cream over it, blending where you need to, then you have a gorgeous rich wine color. When it dries it looks like pure velvet over your lips my husband finds it very sexy. Oh and here is the best part IT DOES NOT COME OFF!! Which my husband also loves, I can put it on in the morning and eat and drink all day and I still have it on when I go to wash my face before bed, if it does fade a little it will be in the middle of your bottom lip and your top lip but it&#x27;s completely ok because with a little bit of fading in those places it makes your lips look sexier and fuller. Love love love this product, I will be ordering this in every color they offer in the soft matte lip.</li>
    <li> Nice matte finish and stays on well. Perfect for nights out on the town</li>
    <li> awsome color, perfect for day or night. smell really good.</li>
    <li> This color is gorgeous!</li>
    <li> Exactly what i wanted!!  Cant wait to wear it this fall!</li>
    <li> LOVE the product and color. NYX Cosmetics you are my number 1. I have tried other items of your products and I am amazed. Pleased to say I will be buying from you from now on.</li>
    <li> This color is so beautiful! And it really lasts.</li>
    <li> I love this color , and I have purchased nyx lip creams before . Love them! But when I got this one in the mail it was basically empty! Not happy.</li>
    <li> BEAUTIFUL PURPLE COLOR, I WEAR THIS WITH NYX FUSHIA 816 LIP LINER, MATCHES PERFECTLY.</li>
    <li> Goes on great, just make sure your lips are moisturized!</li>
    <li> Not as dark as I thought it&#x27;d be,but still a lovely color. love how it starts out as a liquid,then dries into matte look.</li>
    <li> Love the formula of these, and they smell soo good! I&#x27;m planning on getting more of these for sure</li>
