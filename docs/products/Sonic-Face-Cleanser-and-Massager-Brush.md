      <li>Amazing product.</li>
      <li>: I received a discounted price for this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
      <li>, I realized my skin looks brighter and kind of firmer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>received this product for my honest and unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Happy with my solo, took the foreo back and very happy with my savings.</li>
      <li>Super happy.  </li>
      <li>Works wonderfully and makes my face feel so soft,  </li>
      <li>dont use it for cleaning my face, I use it for my face and eye cream, so my skin absorbs it much more better, and by that products that I use are more effective on my skin</li>
      <li>It is very good at clensing and it leaves my face really soft when i use it; to me it substitutes exfoliation.</li>
      <li>The smoothness is most noticeable when I am toning my skin after washing, the pad just glides over my skin.</li>
      <li>Make sure you have a USB plug adapter though.</li>
      <li>Combined with the pulsations, it makes face washing one of the most relaxing experiences of my day.  </li>
      <li>When it is discharged I realize I like this thing more than I thought I would.</li>
      <li>I love the Solo Mio.  </li>
      <li>#34;sink in&amp;#34; more and my face is glowing and firm.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall, very happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>a greater surface area of &amp;#34;scrubbers&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;*Has</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>Now I have many unused Clarisonic brushes to sell!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love how hygienic it is.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>symmetrical shape is more appealing (in my opinion at least)&lt;br /&gt;*Has</li>
      <li>My skin feels better after using this than it did with the Clarisonic Mia.</li>
      <li>I like it more so than my clarisonic.</li>
      <li>LOVE the product and the seller</li>
      <li>While researching, I found this one and compared to the Foreo (way overpriced), this is much better.  </li>
      <li>Perfect to use with your favorite facial wash.</li>
      <li>Thinking of buying 2 more as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has a nice weight and feels comfortable in my hand.  </li>
      <li>love it - so feminine</li>
      <li>I like it more than my clarisonic</li>
      <li>/&gt;Had done some research and found this has more speeds.  </li>
      <li>More over this is rechargeable</li>
      <li>I will keep you posted :)</li>
      <li>I love brush.</li>
      <li>I had one of those bristle type brushes but this one seems to clean even better than that!</li>
      <li>The bristles clean really nicely</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it and look forward to traveling with it because it&#x27;s much more compact than the Clarisonic and won&#x27;t need recharging for a long time.  </li>
      <li>I really liked the concept of using vibrating silicone bristles to clean my face.  </li>
      <li>And I compared this kind of exfoliator to the oscillating brush type, and this is much more gentle and yet still quite effective.  </li>
      <li>Easy to keep clean and nice</li>
      <li>Easy to used pretty good</li>
      <li>Solo Mio would be a great gift for women, but also for teens and young adults that struggle with oily skin and acne.  </li>
      <li>Works well and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>The SOLO Mio is easy to grip and move around the face to reach all areas.  </li>
      <li>The vibrating setting is nice and you can switch to gentle or more aggressive.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
      <li>This leaves my skin so clean and soft - it works great.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m gay</li>
      <li>and it seems super healthy seeing as you can just rinse it off in water.  </li>
      <li>The buttons for increasing and decreasing vibration respond with a flashing light and the unit is charged, but there is no way to turn it on.</li>
      <li>I thought how FABULOUS, you don&#x27;t have to replace a brush head</li>
      <li>If you want to exfoliate or just get the feeling of the smooth polished skin - this won&#x27;t let give it to you.</li>
      <li>I have acne prone skin, so I always have to watch out what products I use, but this product is just so gentle and effective.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Because it&#x27;s not as scratchy as brushes, thought it might be too gentle for oily skin but very pleased so far. Holds charge, easy to keep clean.</li>
    <li> I do like this product.  The different speed are nice the way it cleans my face I like. But I haven&#x27;t notice any difference. Also when I use the side where the on and off button is It always accidentally turns off. It has been about 3 weeks since I&#x27;ve been using this product I&#x27;m hoping that it&#x27;s still to early to notice any change.</li>
    <li> Great for the price.  It does a good job in helping cleaning the skin and massaging the face.</li>
    <li> When purchasing consider:&lt;br /&gt;The side of the device is smaller than you can expect - not bigger than a palm, thus the cleaning surface is very small too. It has backside for deep cleansing, however:&lt;br /&gt;After receiving the item I discovered it&#x27;s meant for normal to sensitive skin - and backside for oily. However, the cleaning features of any sides is very poor. If you want to exfoliate or just get the feeling of the smooth polished skin - this won&#x27;t let give it to you. Overall:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Useful for aging skin for massage (against wrinkles, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;Has backside for oily skin&lt;br /&gt;It DOES say about cleaning around eyes - you can do it with the front surface&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Many amazon reviews of this item are vague - the instruction of the device directly says about eye area, while I asked the customers before byuing - all said, that I&#x27;m not supposed to do it as said by producer, but they did. I suppose only a person who has never seen the device and its instruction can say it, and that makes me suspicious about who writes these reviewes, if any1 really purchased it, or at least ever seen it (even if delivered for free)&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t clean my combination skin - water and foam dry out, while you&#x27;re just moving the device over your face.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t exfoliate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the discounted price it&#x27;s ok, but not more. I&#x27;ll still be purchasing an exfoliating brush</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully and makes my face feel so soft,  I like it more than my clarisonic, it is more simple to use and very easy to clean. It has a nice weight and feels comfortable in my hand.  Good price and the best part is&lt;br /&gt; 2years warranty.</li>
    <li> I just tried my new Solo Mio skincare device and I love it!  Not only is the device is compact, light, and easy-to-use, but it is also very effective in cleaning and massaging your face and neck.  Solo Mio has just the right number of curves and angles to reach all parts of your face, and the device is soft and gentle on your skin.  I really like all the different speeds to clean and/or massage forehead vs. cheek vs. neck vs. under eyes.  I have chronic sinus problems and I found the facial massage very soothing.  Solo Mio would be a great gift for women, but also for teens and young adults that struggle with oily skin and acne.  It makes facial cleaning seem less of a chore!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Love this and so much cheaper than the Forea or Clarisonic! My skin feels very soft after I use this.</li>
    <li> Easy to used pretty good</li>
    <li> Works amazing!  My skin has never been better and it holds a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use it just for cleansing my face, so I don&#x27;t know if it helps with any of the other things the seller claims do. It is very good at clensing and it leaves my face really soft when i use it; to me it substitutes exfoliation. When it is discharged I realize I like this thing more than I thought I would.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know about brightening skin but feels great. Charge lasts forever. Have only charged it once since I got it. Easy to keep clean and nice that I can take it in the shower and not worry about it. As all in all very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is a cute little guy and if you&#x27;re not up for spending the money on the Foreo this is a solid product. It won&#x27;t give you the same deep massage though, even on its highest setting.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:8257431eaf009929d01af8800db80521]] I was very intrigued by this product. Its a perfectly made product for your skin&#x27;s needs. Its got thousands of soft silicone microfingers. It relaxes the muscles and exfoliates at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;Its very soft hence completely safe for your skin. Its water proof too.&lt;br /&gt;A little pink object kept on my toilet cabinet raises many enthusiastic questions. All my friends wanted it for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a very cute transparent box. More over this is rechargeable so you never have to worry about changing batteries. Its got 14 different speed controls so you can adjust it as per your requirement.&lt;br /&gt;Its totally transformed my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Do check out the video to see the product demo.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for my honest and unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed by- Shazia</li>
    <li> I RETURNED IT, JUST WASN&#x27;T DOING THE SAME THING AS THE BRUSH VERSION.</li>
    <li> So... I decided to get this facial cleaning tool instead of dishing out the $150+ for one at Sephora, and boy let me tell you I&#x27;m glad I did!! For a small device as this, it is amazing and cleans extremely well! I had one of those bristle type brushes but this one seems to clean even better than that! Plus, it&#x27;s silicone so it did not irritate or cause any redness when cleaning my face (sometimes the bristle brushes do that to my skin). Overall this is an amazing device... Well worth the price as the quality is on point!&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received a discounted price for this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I love this device! My face feels so clean after using it, and the surface of my skin is getting smoother. The smoothness is most noticeable when I am toning my skin after washing, the pad just glides over my skin. I have also noticed that my moisturizers absorb faster, I am hopeful that over time my complexion will even out. Also, the customer service from this company is AMAZING! Try it!</li>
    <li> I bought this and the FOREO Luna Mini ($140) to compare and I actually like the Mio better, despite costing $100 less!&lt;br /&gt;First off, they are both amazing and they have transformed my skin!  I have never in my life had such well-exfoliated skin.  And I compared this kind of exfoliator to the oscillating brush type, and this is much more gentle and yet still quite effective.  Plus you never have to buy replacement heads for it, and the silicone supposedly discourages bacteria growth.  I highly recommend purchasing a silicone exfoliator, and I don&#x27;t think that the FOREO Luna Mini is worth $100 more than the SOLO Mio.  They both basically do the same thing.  Here&#x27;s are some pro&#x27;s for each:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s of the SOLO Mio ($40)&lt;br /&gt;*Has more speeds (at least 4) than the Luna Mini (only 2) (CORRECTION: the MIO has 14 speeds, not 4)&lt;br /&gt;*Has a greater surface area of &amp;#34;scrubbers&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;*Has as a sharper angle to it to help reach narrow places like the sides of the nose.&lt;br /&gt;*Has a silicone stopper that covers up the charging port when not in use while the Luna Mini does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s of the FOREO Luna Mini ($140)&lt;br /&gt;*Is slightly more quiet and vibrates less in the hand (this is still very minor)&lt;br /&gt;*Is made of a more opaque silicone that looks a little more high-end (the SOLO Mio is a little transparent)&lt;br /&gt;*The symmetrical shape is more appealing (in my opinion at least)&lt;br /&gt;*Has a 2-year warranty like the SOLO Mio, but also offers 50% off a replacement product for 10 years after the end of the warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for me, I think the folks that made the SOLO Mio actually improved upon the FOREO Luna Mini in several ways.  Even if they were the same price, I will still buy the SOLO Mio.  For me the larger surface area makes the difference.  My mom tried mine and loves it, so now she&#x27;s buying one too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note: for some reason when I uploaded my pics they look very neon pink on here. The color of both the Luna and the Mio are pretty accurate in the pictures that the companies put out for the products.io are pretty accurate in the pictures that the companies put out for the products.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! This is the brand you turn to for a sonic facial cleansing tool! It is better than the overpriced version demonstrated to me at Sephora (don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love Sephora, but come on. $199??? No.) in a couple ways.&lt;br /&gt;1. The price. It&#x27;s worth every penny. And it&#x27;s a lot less pennies than its sister versions.&lt;br /&gt;2. It pulses all the way to the top, more expensive models do not.&lt;br /&gt;3. 14 speeds.&lt;br /&gt;4. Works fantastic for massaging serums and night creams in. Decadent.&lt;br /&gt;I use this three days a week with my Boscia cleanser. The rest of the week I use a konjac sponge with cleanser. I have a slew of other products I use, but since purchasing the Solo Mio, my skin is brighter, and since its gently exfoliates, the size of my pores are appearing smaller.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I really love this device, it leaves my skin so clean and soft. I used to have those little back heads on my nose and once I started using the SOLO Mio my nose clear up. It removed them. Over all my skin hasn&#x27;t been this nice in a long time.</li>
    <li> The solo mio is my go to bathroom item when it comes to washing my face. It helps exfoliate and brighten up my skin. Perfect to use with your favorite facial wash. It has different vibration modes to meet your exact needs. I&#x27;ve used this for about 3 months and it&#x27;s still going strong. One downside is it only comes with the cord. So you&#x27;ll need to plug the usb into a separate charger (I use my iphone charger plug ^^)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. When I started using it, my face broke out. I thought because it&#x27;s a new product I&#x27;m adding to my regimen, that it was going to happen. However, after continuous use, I noticed that my breakouts weren&#x27;t clearing up and they got worse. I used the same face wash as before. Nothing else changed, but this. I even tried using all the settings but still the same results.</li>
    <li> First of all I dont have any other more expensive version of this product, and I havent got a chance to use any one of them, so I cant really compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my experience with Solo Mio is great. works perfectly, charge lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont use it for cleaning my face, I use it for my face and eye cream, so my skin absorbs it much more better, and by that products that I use are more effective on my skin, I realized my skin looks brighter and kind of firmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if I am making this up, but serioulsy when I look at mirror, I am like : I look better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically, I put my cream on my face, disturb it with my hand and massage with Solo Mio to my skin to absorb it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review in a month, and share my experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, also great customer service and packaging.</li>
    <li> After 3 days I am in love!!  My skin is glowing and feels so soft.  Beats the clarisonic and costs the price of the replacement heads.  I will update after continued use</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product. Great condition</li>
    <li> I love the Solo Mio.  I was very surprise how good it was with a very affordable price compare to the very expensive brands.  The charge last a long time.  I been using the Solo Mio for a month 1/2 and still did not charge it.  I use it twice a daily.  I wear make up every day.  And after I clean my face  with the Solo Mio I could defiantly feel the difference.  My face feels so clean.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. My face was so smooth after I used this device. No need to buy the super expensive one. this one does all the work.</li>
    <li> This is a silly purchase. Does nothing</li>
    <li> No better than than a washcloth.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. I have been using clarisonic for years but I came across this item, read the reviews and decided to try it.  So far so good, I like it, my skin is super soft. I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 because I&#x27;ve only used it a few days.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have used it about 20 times now....I wanted to make sure I was able to write a proper review!  Not only has my complection cleared significantly, my skin is also super soft!  I use it with a mild acne face wash;). The best perks: It is 100% waterproof &amp; 100% re-chargable!  I&#x27;m actually surprised at how long it can hold a charge!!!!  Very decent price compared to other similar products on amazon. The seller also made sure to send along proper instructions as well as a helpline number just in case!!!  Buy it now, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for several months now and I&#x27;m amazed at how much different my skin looks now. This really cleanses your skin and prepares it for your skincare routine. Super gentle and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation. I usually use the side with the smaller bristles, but occassionally I will use the side with the larger bristles for a super deep cleanse. Since using the SOLO Mio, I haven&#x27;t used any nose pore strips because this takes care my blackheads. As a facial massager, it&#x27;s just OK. I tried it once and b/c each side has bristles, I preffered using it as a facial brush cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This charges in less than an hour and a single charge lasts for approximately 2 months. This only comes with the USB charger, so you&#x27;ll need to either use your computer or a USB power plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is obviously a generic version of the more expensive Foreo Luna and, though there are some differences, the Mio is just as effective. The silicone in both the Foreo and Mio are both smooth and non-irritating, but the Mio seems &amp;#34;thinner&amp;#34;, The Mio does feel a lot better in my hand and costs a LOT less than the Foreo. The Mio advertises more speed, but unless you go to the extremes (really fast or really slow), the speed change increments are not that noticeable.</li>
    <li> I have a clarisonic mia and bought this b/c I thought (according to the description and reviews) it was a replacement for the clarisonic mia.  I thought how FABULOUS, you don&#x27;t have to replace a brush head and it seems super healthy seeing as you can just rinse it off in water.  SOLO MIO IS NOT A MAKE-UP REMOVAL SYSTEM.  It wasn&#x27;t until I spoke to the company that I realized that.  They said you should wash your face first...making sure all your make-up is removed prior to usage.  You then use the solo mio as a massager type device.  It is a massagers and will supposedly remove the excess dirt...what you may have left over after washing your face.  The company says you are supposed to see some sort of difference in your face after a month of usage.  I have decided to continue usage it to see if I see a difference in my face.  I will update later to let you know.  I just wanted you to know that this IS NOT a replacement for any sort of make-up removal product...PLEASE do not toss your clarisonic.  I am currently using them both.  Yes, this adds to my morning and evening beauty routine - UGH!  But, hey...I will try and see if it really does do anything different for my face.  I will keep you posted :)</li>
    <li> Really 14 speeds??!! I can not feel the difference at all!</li>
    <li> I used nutra sonic brush and my skin feel super clean.  However, it need to recharge at least 1 a week for a whole day and hence gradually stop using it. This sonic facial brush seems to hold battery for a long time, so I took a try.  It almost 3 months since I bought it, it didn&#x27;t disappoint me.  I only charged it once when I received it and still operating. IMHO, the nutra sonic brush cleaned my face better but it just useless if it always out of battery.</li>
    <li> Received today.  Super happy.  Saw the Luna Foreo at my dermatologists office, but seemed way over priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had done some research and found this has more speeds.  Works well and easy to use.  It feels just like the Foreo to me, but a fraction of the price w a two year warranty and a very nice email from seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed.  Thinking of buying 2 more as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy so my only complaint is my only color choice was pink.  I&#x27;m gay so pink is fine, but suppose it depends on the buyer😃. Works well and is super gentle unlike my Neutrogena exfoliating thing which is more like a mini belt sander.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This I can use EVERYDAY.  LOVE the product and the seller</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just been using it a week and so far I really feel the extra clean feeling after washing and I just use a gentle cleanser. I would definitely recommend it to friends and family, so much better than the buff puff I used as a teenager and the regular spin brush kind doesn&#x27;t make my face feel as clean. I am really happy with the price over other brands !</li>
    <li> This is great, the charge lasts a long time, and I&#x27;ve been breaking out much less. Also, uh. This is essentially a small, water proof, quiet small vibrating motor... so. You could multitask. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend exfoliating the downstairs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for one week (I received it on a Sunday - the day after I ordered it!).  I&#x27;d planned to buy the $140 sonic brush that is similar but when I searched Amazon and found this one - I was sold. Great price, 2 year warranty, great reviews. There are also cheaper sonic brushes but I decided to pay a little more and get much better quality. Another deciding factor was the cover for the charging port. Great addition to avoid charging issues later on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I activate it, I just leave it on the preset setting but you can increase or decrease the vibration.  My skin feels better after using this than it did with the Clarisonic Mia. I&#x27;m very happy with it and look forward to traveling with it because it&#x27;s much more compact than the Clarisonic and won&#x27;t need recharging for a long time.  The best part is there are no no replacement parts to buy. Now I have many unused Clarisonic brushes to sell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 11/23/16 - I still use this everyday and still love it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this because I was looking at the Clarisonic brushes. I LOVE this item!! I use it twice daily and I actually notice that my pores are barely visible and my skin looks and feels better!!</li>
    <li> Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I think this is already helping my skin, and I have only used it a few times. You can really work it hard and clear out blackheads without causing damage to the skin. It doesn&#x27;t feel like a deep massage but it is relaxing and I think it s important that it is gentle. Finally I have a tool that does a thorough job without scraping my skin. This is my first electronic cleansing brush and I like knowing that I am covering my entire face, not missing any spots...that is hard to do with a washcloth, etc.</li>
    <li> I love brush. Gives a good massage n I think makes face look beta. No cleanin it .it perfect face brush:)</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results yet, but will keep using</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week, and the Clarisonic is going in the garbage!  This leaves my skin so clean and soft - it works great.  I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it!</li>
    <li> I liked how this functioned and really noticed a difference in how my moisturizer was drawn into my skin after using this. However, within two months of purchasing it, the power button seems to have fallen into the device behind the silicone and it doesn&#x27;t function anymore - there is no resistance behind the silicone to turn the device on or off. The buttons for increasing and decreasing vibration respond with a flashing light and the unit is charged, but there is no way to turn it on.</li>
    <li> this is exactly like the luna so save some money and get this</li>
    <li> The Solo Mio worked exactly as stated.&lt;br /&gt;Only wish there was a video I could watch to see if I am using it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;Love how it cleans though.</li>
    <li> I love this beauty tool!  My skin feels so soft after each use.</li>
    <li> Returned, due to not what I expected. The rubber knobs ( I guess that&#x27;s what they are called) were not raised enough to do any deep cleaning. Seemed to just glide over the surface of my face...not like other ones I have used in the past. This item was mediocre at BEST!!! Not worth the time, money, or effort.</li>
    <li> Love this device! The best at cleaning and smoothing your skin. You do have to use as directed. I love how hygienic it is. No brushes to replace over and over.</li>
    <li> Saw the same product at Sephora for $159.00. Only difference is where the power plug is located.</li>
    <li> My best friend has the Foreo Luna- I literally put hers to one side of my face and my SOLO Mio on the other, felt almost exactly the same! The only difference is the SOLO Mio&#x27;s little brush things are not quite as firm as the fore, but I am still extremely satisfied with this product. Would absolutely buy again.</li>
    <li> My face is so soft and smooth, I have tried it on the razor bumps on the backs of my legs and it is smoothing those out too! Powerful for such a little thing.  Have used it for several weeks now, though not daily, and the battery is still going strong.  Haven&#x27;t had to recharge yet.  Make sure you have a USB plug adapter though. It&#x27;s not a standard plug for recharged, it&#x27;s a USB cable and it doesn&#x27;t come with a two prong adapter.</li>
    <li> The Solo Mio is amazing! I have been on a search for sonic cleansers that were gentle and yet effective on my  36yr old skin and this one bypassed the Clarisonic Mia in that array.  When I used the Clarisonic, my face would be left dry and irritated because it was just too much scrubbing on my Retin-a face.  So, after trying a sephora cleansing pad, I fell in love with Silicone but wanted more oomph behind the cleansing.  While researching, I found this one and compared to the Foreo (way overpriced), this is much better.  The shape is so much easier to hold and maneuver around the face &amp; nose area.  Combined with the pulsations, it makes face washing one of the most relaxing experiences of my day.  Also, I noticed that my serums and creams seem to &amp;#34;sink in&amp;#34; more and my face is glowing and firm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I highly recommend this device especially for the retin-a users.</li>
    <li> love it - so feminine</li>
    <li> Its cute little things. I like it more so than my clarisonic.</li>
    <li> I a still on the fence.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the solo mio for about 3 and a half weeks now and so far I&#x27;m satisfied with it. I don&#x27;t use it everyday even though it says it can be used twice a day. I use it about 2-3 times/week and when I do my skin feels super soft and smooth. I don&#x27;t feel it has decreased breakouts or had any effect on them really. Although when I first received it I was using it everyday and I got a couple of cystic bumps (I hadn&#x27;t gotten any in quite a while) but after giving it a couple days of not using the solo mio, they healed quick and were gone. After that experience I&#x27;ve decided to just use this product 2-3 times a week and have not had any breakout issues since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, its a good product. Very gentle, adjustable, and a great value!</li>
    <li> I ordered this after seeing a similar but more expensive product at Sephora.  I really liked the concept of using vibrating silicone bristles to clean my face.  I have been using Clarisonic for years, with the extra sensitive brush head.  I was looking to switch because even the sensitive brush head leave my skin a bit sore, so I can&#x27;t use it everyday.  I&#x27;ve used the SOLO Mio now 2x a day for a week straight and I love it.  It is really non abrasive.  My face feels super clean and the skin doesn&#x27;t feel &#x27;abused&#x27;.  The bristles clean really nicely and I don&#x27;t have to worry about replacement.  The vibrating setting is nice and you can switch to gentle or more aggressive.  I can also use this with a massage cream, which I couldn&#x27;t with my Clarisonic.  Overall, very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Solo Mio for about 2 months now and I really do love it! After using a Clarisonic for so long, this machine took a little while getting used to. It does not &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; your face like the Clarisonic, so I wasn&#x27;t really sure I was getting a deep cleaning. So I switched to a white washcloth (usually use Black!) and all my makeup was really gone. Here&#x27;s why I like it:&lt;br /&gt;1. So Small and Cordless, takes up so much less room on my counter&lt;br /&gt;2. Feels super hygienic - no brushes to go bad or replace, just rinse it off and it dries almost immediately&lt;br /&gt;3. The charge LASTS FOREVER! Still haven&#x27;t had to recharge....great for vacays&lt;br /&gt;4. Small amount of soap required. I wash face first, then put a small amount of cleaner on dry unit. The water left on my face&lt;br /&gt;is enough to really get a good lather going.&lt;br /&gt;5. Price! Such a great deal and high quality&lt;br /&gt;About my face: I have what I could consider Normal/Dry skin, so this works for me and this type. I use Retinol products and this does help get rid of the &amp;#34;flakies&amp;#34; that these types of treatments sometimes cause. I would not say it gets rid of blackheads, but does help prevent them.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helped!</li>
    <li> I use this product daily and have noticed a big change in the appearance of my skin. I have acne prone skin, so I always have to watch out what products I use, but this product is just so gentle and effective. I highly recommend the Solo Mio!</li>
    <li> Wonderful!  My face is very soft and fresh looking after only 2 weeks of using the product.  The SOLO Mio is easy to grip and move around the face to reach all areas.  The silicone is very soft and gentle to the skin, and I really like that that there are multiple speeds of vibration (good for different areas of the face). It is a great massage! Another nice thing is that the product is compact and can charge through a USB cable, perfect for the traveler.  I highly recommend this product in a daily cleaning routine of the face.</li>
    <li> I just bought this skin cleansing device for my wife as a gift, and she has now used it for a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;She really loves this product! The Solo Mio fits in her hand just right and is super easy to use. She reported that immediately after using it the first time, her skin felt soft and tingling, and retained a healthy glow for a long time. She also likes the portability of the Solo Mio and the ease to recharge it (great idea using a USB cable!). She feels it is well designed and truly delivers a mini facial in the comfort of her own home.&lt;br /&gt;She plans to use it every day as part of her cleansing routine and has already recommended it to her best friend.</li>
    <li> I love my solo mio!! I had a clarisonic but I gave it away. So I purchased the mio and saw results instantly. The texture of my skin is much smoother. I only break out during my cycle but it&#x27;s not as bad. I have normal to oily skin and this has helped my daily skin care routine tremendously!!!!</li>
    <li> Happy with my solo, took the foreo back and very happy with my savings.</li>
