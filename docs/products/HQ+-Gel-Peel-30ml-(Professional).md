      <li>I&#x27;d rather be embarrassed for trying tohelp someone than because I have a huge zit any day!!    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad my children won&#x27;t have acne like I did!    </li>
      <li>so pleased after over a year of trial and error to have found this product!</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>I wish you all good SKIN :)</li>
      <li>Be created use your own oils and aroma with&lt;br /&gt;the clay.</li>
      <li>Cetaphil gentle cleanser works great for me!  </li>
      <li>I think this is quite effective.</li>
      <li>Kind of how people with browner complexions tan quicker.  </li>
      <li>, apply immediately for that warm aroma.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So on day 12 I did the HQ+ peel and the blemishes are already healing quite nicely the day after.  </li>
      <li>I really liked it.       </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have any ice pick-type acne scarring, so I can&#x27;t testify if this peel is effective on that type of scarring or not.</li>
      <li>Then I had my own kids (which is when I got melasma )</li>
      <li>and I got over my own guilt.</li>
      <li>But it seems effective.</li>
      <li>Wonderful product so far!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;While this peel isn&#x27;t as strong as the Jessner peel I&#x27;ve had done in the Salon, it is a good peel.</li>
      <li>I have used this peel 4 times now, in tandem with a mild skin bleaching cream (and a ton of moisturizer and SPF of course), and I have had great results.</li>
      <li>Pretty good product!</li>
      <li>(OLAY makes a good inexpensive anti-aging serum that is fragrance free).  </li>
      <li>I have tried ALL the home peels - this is by far the best!</li>
      <li>Its perfect for once in a blue moon peeling, mostly in winter!</li>
      <li>I had great results after the first use.</li>
      <li>Sunscreen is very important.  </li>
      <li>Although those also worked well, my skin has changed over the years and now this HQ peel is definitely the one that is working best for me at this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Yes, I smoke and have for more years</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>I love Skin Laboratory and have been using their products for over 7yrs.</li>
      <li>more so if you have oily skin it will take care of that.</li>
      <li>I am glad that I read all warnings and cautions before I used it.  </li>
      <li>I ALMOST feel comfortable in my own skin just as,it was meant to be.</li>
      <li>to all this Skin Laboratory does not test on animals :)</li>
      <li>but everything&#x27;s looking way better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect combination!</li>
      <li>this stuff is magic.</li>
      <li>but it was much more bearable and has been ever since.</li>
      <li>MAKE SURE you buy the one that will work better for your skin type.</li>
      <li>I have tried the oil of olay regenerist microdermabrasion and peel system and have gotten better results for a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more when this one runs out.</li>
      <li>it was okay,..</li>
      <li>Lactic acid peels work so much better at clearing up my acne</li>
      <li>My skin seems to drink up moisturizer better now instead of it just sitting on top of my skin.</li>
      <li>I must say my skin is looking better.</li>
      <li>many... peels at the dermatologist office.</li>
      <li>one more thing - leave on for 4 mins, it didn&#x27;t hurt one bit</li>
      <li>many...</li>
      <li>Well, I&#x27;m so glad I found this product</li>
      <li>The redness has mostly subsided, but I&#x27;m still peeling in areas.  </li>
      <li>I use this along with the 30% glycolic acid gel peel from SkinLaboratory and love it.  </li>
      <li>I will get even more off.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been doing the peel on Sunday nights, and by the next Friday I look great!</li>
      <li>The redness has mostly subsided, but I&#x27;m still peeling in areas.  </li>
      <li>Surely it would heal by that interview.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 3</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Doing these at home is a cost saver, but make sure you follow the instructions and use a moisturizer afterwards.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried acutane 2x&#x27;s, many chemical peels for which I&#x27;ve paid $135.00 PER peeling,</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s a peel. Read the instructions and know your skin before you try it. Some people have different reactions to peels. Doing these at home is a cost saver, but make sure you follow the instructions and use a moisturizer afterwards. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> This product did not accomplish what I expected it to. I used it as directed with little change. Would not reorder</li>
    <li> This worked great on my skin. I had brown spots that peeled off. Very good alternative to going to a salon for this treatment.</li>
    <li> I too ordered the HQ+ Gel Peel, Level 3, and received a HQ+ Peel, Level 4. I am 45, with acne and severe melsama on my cheeks and forearms. The first peel stung, just like the in-office dermatologist peels, and frosted, as a previous reviewer noted. From the moment I washed it off, I could see a significant reduction of the melsama darkness, and an overall smother, brighter complexion.   Judging from the effectiveness of the product I quickly reordered two, with hopes that I would receive the Level 4 peel (which I did).  My second peel did not frost, but I was able to leave it on for 5 minutes. I can hardly wait for the day when I feel good about my sink, and this product has given me HOPE!!!</li>
    <li> First of all, I want to mention how very strong this peel is. Not only does it have a rather strong chemical odor, but it really stings when applied. The instructions say to leave it on for 30 seconds for the first application and build up to several minutes on subsequent applications. However, the first time I used this product, I could only stand leaving it on for about 10 seconds. It stung rather intensely, and the chemical fumes made my eyes water so that I could barely keep them open. I had to rinse my skin off for a good 5 minutes to makes the burning stop, but after that, my skin was hardly red and it didn&#x27;t burn at all anymore. Each time I use this, I&#x27;ve only been able to keep it on for about 10-15 seconds longer than the previous time before I had to rinse it off. Also, the instructions say to apply only once every 10-14 days, but I&#x27;ve been using it every 7 days since I rinse it off so quickly.     Even though I haven&#x27;t been able to keep it on for more than 30 seconds tops, I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in my skin. I have pretty bad skin: acne-prone, lots of old indented scars, and hyperpigmentation like no other. But I just did my third application, and my skin is a lot smoother and old acne spots are very noticeably fading. My pores practically disappeared overnight, and my face is sooo much less oily during the day. In just one day, I could already see results, and they just get better with each application.     I&#x27;ve used this company&#x27;s glycolic peel before, which made me break out after each use and left my skin red for a week afterwards. However, I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t had any breakouts with this peel, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face red at all (but that might be because I leave it on for only a short amount of time).     Overall, I would really recommend this product (use it carefully!), and I can&#x27;t wait to see the full results in a few more weeks!    UPDATE: So I&#x27;m on my second round of treatment (6 weeks at a time), and I&#x27;m still loving this product. Now thatI&#x27;ve been able to keep it on for 3-4 mins though, it does make my skin slightly red. But it&#x27;s nothing terrible, and it starts to fade in a few days. I am still seeing improvement in the texture and complexion of my skin. After my first 6-week treatment, I took a break for 4 weeks, and I noticed that my skin continually looked better and better every week. Now that I&#x27;m back on the peel, it does look a little worse, but once I&#x27;m done again, it will probably start getting better. So in my experience, it takes several weeks after treatment to get the full effect of this amazing peel.    Also, as a disclaimer, be warned of the chemicals in the ingredients, particularly hydroquinone. You can search up some information on it and use at your own discretion! I felt that the potential benefits were worth the risks (just my opinion), but I discontinued use after one bottle.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;ll start off by saying that this product definitely works as seen by all the five star reviews.     Second, about the HQ+ peel itself: The first time I used the product the stinging was intense and nearly unbearable. I couldn&#x27;t wash it off fast enough after barely 30 seconds. The second time, however, I expected a similar experience but it was much more bearable and has been ever since. I now keep it on for 3 minutes and do experience peeling a day or two later (not sheets of skin like a professional spa peel, but enough to be quite noticeable especially if using makeup).     Third and last of all, my only concern is regarding the long-term effects of using this product. I have used the product 5 times now, only two of those times have I made it up to leaving it on for the full 3 minutes. Of those two longest times, however, I have also noticed that afterward I seem to get a headache and just don&#x27;t really feel well. Is this the product? I have absolutely no idea, but after experiencing what appear to be the same side effects immediately after using this peel -twice now- I find myself concerned enough to wonder about long-term effects/health risks I am exposing myself to.     Sadly, as much as this product does seem to appear to work, I can&#x27;t justify the possible health risks it may pose whether they be real or merely a coincidence on my part. If this is not a concern you share or this product has, in fact, been deemed safe then by all means give it a try because otherwise it really does seem to be effective.</li>
    <li> I placed my order September 2010 and did not receive the item as photographed.  I received HQ + Peel LEVEL 4 instead of the BHA + HQ Peel Level 3.  Title on this item does not match the photograph provided by company.  Careful ordering this since the description does not match the photograph...    I use this along with the 30% glycolic acid gel peel from SkinLaboratory and love it.  Acne breakouts are smaller and don&#x27;t last as long.  Stings like crazy, but its a good sensation for me because I know it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in desperation. I&#x27;m 26 with olive/medium tone complexion, and mixed combination skin. A year ago I was put on a slue of antibiotics for an illness which left every pimple I got with a dark red scar. All scars are located on my cheeks. I am getting married in June so I have a strict deadline to lighten/get rid of my scars. I have done the microderm abrasion route along with professional chemical peels, and tried a decent amount of creams that contain retinal. I came across this product and despite the mixed reviews (regarding possible negative health reactions) I tried to give it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Physical Aspects:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for a couple of months now. Upon first applying it there was some slight burning but I was able to keep it on for the full five minutes. I had NO peeling until after maybe the first month of treatment. The only areas that did peel were my chin and the creases of my nose. To this day I can apply the peel without any burning sensation. I have also started to &#x27;spot treat&#x27; my bad areas instead of doing my full face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frequency: I use this once a week, I feel it works better after a shower or waiting for your shower to heat up. The warmth/steam helps open your pores and allows the peel to penetrate better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outcome: As far as my scars go, I have noticed a slight improvement. They are not as red and have become easier to cover with foundation ( I find that bare minerals powder works best) If you are looking for an overnight response this is not the product. It&#x27;s going to take time. Whether or not it will rid my scars completely I don&#x27;t know but I am hopeful because of the small improvement. Anyone dealing with acne scars knows any little thing is a miracle! Regarding my skins overall appearance, I have had less breakouts and it definitely does make your skin feel smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***the product I received however is NOT the one shown in the picture. I received a level 4 HQ only peel, as I have noticed others have as well.ave as well.</li>
    <li> I have used this peel 4 times now, in tandem with a mild skin bleaching cream (and a ton of moisturizer and SPF of course), and I have had great results. I have had acne for over 10 years, and some changes in hormones over the past year has left me with a TON of scars to deal with, and this peel has been great for treating those scars, as well as drying up some of my acne.     That said, you should be very careful with this peel. It is very harsh, and even if you feel like your skin can take it, you really shouldn&#x27;t use it any more often than every 10-14 days. Also, hydroquinone is a controversial ingredient, and has been linked to skin cancer in concentrations higher than 4%. I&#x27;m considering switching to lactic acid peels instead.    Just thought I&#x27;d share my concern. It&#x27;s probably fine if you follow the directions and do not use it too often.</li>
    <li> The skin certainly look a lot better after using.  The skin will tighten and than flake off gently.  There is very little harshness to this and zero hiding from your co-workers the next few days.  Of course this means you have to use it a few times to get nice results... and boy... are they nice results!</li>
    <li> I ordered HQ+ Gel Peel, 30ml (Professional). Did not receive a gel, but instead a watery,  smelly liquid which I&#x27;ve used two weeks in a row with no effect. Maybe there&#x27;s a quality control issue, but I feel I received a placebo.[[ASIN:B002GJND8O HQ+ Gel Peel, 30ml (Professional)]]</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews, I was convinced this would help with my acne scars and residual acne. First of all, this peel is intense. I actually frosted the two or three times that I tried it. Frosting is a white residue that forms on the skin and is a sign that the product is penetrating deeply, below the epidermis to the dermis (making it a medium grade peel). This is actually something good if you want to get rid of complexion problems or acne scars. The problem is that I was still breaking out around my chin and thought that this product would help clear up my acne. It did, but left tiny indents where the pimples healed. It happened once after my first peel, but I decided to give the peel another try since I thought maybe it was a fluke. Second time I used the peel, the same thing happened. I ended up with an even larger dent around my chin.     If you are prone to acne scarring, STAY AWAY from this peel unless your acne has cleared up. I&#x27;m hesitant to use it on healthy skin because it&#x27;s a little too strong and hasn&#x27;t really worked to my benefit. Lactic acid peels work so much better at clearing up my acne (pimples dry up within an hour or two after application, it&#x27;s amazing).    Just be careful.</li>
    <li> I had to wait a few weeks to try this product out thoroughly before I did a review. I had a quarter sized, medium brown pigmentation mark on my cheek that developed a year ago as well as a small brown dot on my nose. I had an IPL done, and though the dot on my nose was gone, it left four larger dark brown spots on my nose! The cheek mark was still the same. I looked pretty awful and decided to cut my losses. I eventually found my way to looking at Skin Laboratory peel reviews and purchased the HQ+gel. It was certainly cheaper than three IPL treatments, so what was there to lose?    This is an incredible peel! After the first treatment, there was significant improvement on the pigmentation spots, and after my fifth treatment, the marks are completely gone! I really didn&#x27;t think it would work this well. Look no further because it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and I&#x27;m really happy with the results.     About the process.......Work your way up by starting with 1-2 minutes and lengthen the time successively. The spots where you will apply this product will darken and look a bit bruised for a couple days after, so don&#x27;t plan any special social events until after it begins to peel. You could minimize the appearance of it with some makeup cover. Be patient, as it will take about a month and a half of treatments before the process is complete. I actually got a good peel the last time by rubbing my nose LIGHTLY with a slight abrasive before applying the gel, but be careful with this method. Believe in this amazing product because I can say it works! Thanks a lot Skin Laboratory.</li>
    <li> I am new to chemical peels, but I like this one a lot.  I am in my 30s and have always had acne prone skin, and as a result have large pores and mild rolling acne scars.  I started with the 50% lactic peel made by this company.  It brought a lot of pimples to the surface and after a few peels my skin was definitely clearer, but I didn&#x27;t notice a lot of difference in the scars, and the lactic acid tended to leave my skin oily.  (I&#x27;ve read that AHA&#x27;s like lactic acid don&#x27;t cut through oil in the way that BHA&#x27;s like salicylic acid can.)  So I decided to try the HQ+ instead, because it has both lactic and salicylic acid.  I did the first peel last night, and compared to the lactic, it has a very chemical odor--like nail polish remover--but it did cut through the oil and had a more dramatic effect on the scars.  I think my skin is definitely smoother today, so I look forward to the results after a few more peels!  I haven&#x27;t noticed any sloughing, maybe in a couple days that will happen.  With the lactic, a little loufa in the shower after a few days of healing removed the little bit of dead skin fast.  Anyway, great product!</li>
    <li> I thought the product would come 4 days afer I ordered it, like other products I ordered online. But it arrived Right Away.One and half day after I ordered it. Wow. Super! I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it on. It&#x27;s mild. I left it on for 3 minutes for the first time use. A little redness after I washed it off and it&#x27;s gone in 10 minutes. I hope there will be some good change on my face after several uses. I think The Products from Skin Laboratory is mild and safe. It&#x27;s worh to try.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! i&#x27;ve used them all- glycolic, lactic, tca, jessner with not so great results. Either it did nothing or I burned my face and created the dark areas that I was trying to get rid of in the first place. I am 48 with asian blood which means Im prone to hyperpigmentation. I would get a little white head that would never come to surface and I of course would worry it and pick it. The result would be an ugly brown spot. This product has cleared my skin so I no longer have bumps/white heads. So it gets to the source of the problem. It also through only two uses have noticeably diminished my dark spots and cleared my skin. It looks so much better Im so pleased after over a year of trial and error to have found this product! My only caution would be not to get too overzealous. Apply a maximum of 2 layers and leave on no longer than 2 minutes. Adjust to your skin. I applied a little too much in one area and created a hot spot (frosting) its peeling and theres no damage but it is a STRONG peel. It would be more effective to apply more frequently with a lighter hand and for a shorter time. The cumulative effect will pay off.</li>
    <li> I have \\&quot;bad skin\\&quot; and this is great for that problem. I have yet to head back to the doctor for pills for my acne (which made me gain weight) and awful injections. I recommend this product. Also this company is one of the best to order product froms. Many times they send me extra samples of other peels and I always receive my product early.</li>
    <li> I wanted a peel that would help get rid of my hyperpigmentation from acne scars, lessen the appearance of my pores/acne scars, and help me control my mild-moderate acne breakouts.    The first time I used this product I made sure to read the directions, tested a spot on my inner elbow, avoided heavy sun exposure prior, stopped using topicals for 48 hours before etc.    The day after using the peel my face felt very calm. It felt like my face was finally \\&quot;normal\\&quot;, it felt very smooth and soft. And over the next few days I noticed no new acne appearing.    Its very important that you don&#x27;t expose your face to direct/continuous sunlight for at least a day after doing the peel.    Also, you should wear a spf 30 suncreen whenever you go out, even if its cloudy outside. If you don&#x27;t you will have wasted your time because your skin will just get even more damaged.</li>
    <li> Im a 22 year old female who has combination skin and pimple scars.I recently bought this peel and it works great, within the first treatment ( left on for a minute) my pores appeared smaller. I have never suffered too much when it comes to black heads but I have always had visable pores around my nose that could easily turn into a clogged pore. The burning sensation isnt unbearable, at first i didnt even feel any discomfort after the third treatment i decided i wanted something more drastic so i brushed the chemical on my face as opposed to using the cotton ball. I left it on for two minutes. This time I experienced a bit more burning, although my face stayed a slight pink, after two days my pores were practicly invisable, my slight pimple scars were gone, my face looked amazing, my skin appeared flawless. BE SURE TO MOISTURIZE AFTER EACH TREATMENT. The intructions say if possible to withdraw away from wearing makeup for a couple of hours after,to avoid harsh sunlight, and not to wax 48 hours before or after. My boyfriend couldnt stop staring. Over all i love this product, my skin looks so refreshed and flawless.</li>
    <li> I just want to say that I will never again pay someone else to do my chem peels! This product is amazing. It does what it says it will and it is way cheaper than going to a salon, and on top of that you don&#x27;t have to make an appointment :D    I want to reiterate that it does what it says it will. Don&#x27;t be stupid. The instructions say leave the product on for 1-4 minutes. [10 minutes is the absolute maximum time any trained professional is legally allowed to leave a peel on] If you leave it on longer than the instructions say, you WILL BURN YOUR SKIN. Bottom line.    [I write that in rebuttal to all of the negative reviews written by people who left the product on for 30 minutes and don&#x27;t understand why they suffered skin burns]    All in all, I would definitely recommend this peel to anyone with acne or acne scaring.</li>
    <li> Got this because of good reviews. Pretty much just rubbing alcohol,did nothing other than a menthol smell...don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Just be careful of how long it is on your face, get a personal fan to cool it down, but it does work. Try it once a month for the first 2 just to make sure u can get use to it.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says. It helps even the worst cases of acne, scaring, wrinkles, and skin texture. After using the product my face looked much more vibrant and younger. You also can visibly notice the difference in the size of your pores.     With all that said it is important to understand that it takes about 4-7 days after use to start to see the results. In the immediate days following application your face will flake, peel, and discolor to the point where you may regret having used the peel! Just make sure you use PLENTY of facial lotion that contains spf and you will be fine. Again, this is not a peel to use if you have someone you want to impress in the next couple of days, but if your schedule looks pretty clear for a week then go for it, the results will be great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had adult acne for several years, treating topically with both over-the-counter and prescription products. None of them cleared my acne, and as a result I have many hyperpigmented spots from old blemishes. My skin is very oily, and nothing I have tried in the past has been able to control my oiliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initial application of the peel is a little painful - it stings more than any product I&#x27;ve put on my face. This peel is potentially damaging if you don&#x27;t follow the instructions, so definitely be careful when using it. With that said, I&#x27;ve noticed such an improvement in my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finished my second application of the peel a few days ago and my face is so much clearer! Two days after the first application it seemed to bring several blemishes to the surface, but since those initial ones have healed I haven&#x27;t had a single new blemish. I can already notice the hyperpigmented spots are beginning to fade, as well. I don&#x27;t have any ice pick-type acne scarring, so I can&#x27;t testify if this peel is effective on that type of scarring or not. I will continue to use this product, and highly recommend to anyone with oily, acne-ridden skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice now. I fortunately do not have a current acne problem but did years ago. I have a lot of scars from them just red spots on my face. I have used twice and my face is so smooth and pours are a lot smaller, but the spots hace faded but not like I expected. Does anyone know how long it takes to actually fade the acne scars? from experience.? all in all no regrets i love the product. I am not just waiting to get to use again! I&#x27;ll update on the progress.</li>
    <li> I am an RN and used to work for a plastic surgeon who had a medi spa. We would get chemical peels when we wanted. I feel that this product was better than what I used in the office. I had great results after the first use. My skin was so smooth and my acne much better. I experienced minimal peeling and no redness. The product did sting like the office products but because I am used to the peels, I was able to leave it on for 4 minutes. I will definitely order more.</li>
    <li> It came on time and is the HQ+ peel unlike the HQ that some of u got. I have blemishes from old acne no active acne. I have applied it twice with a week&#x27;s interval. I am an Indian guy in the late 20s with oily skin and medium brown complexion.I use UltraClerasil face wash twice a day which has stopped new outbreaks.    I can see some change. But the caveat is:  Don&#x27;t keep it for more than 4-5 min. More time doesn&#x27;t equal more recovery. It&#x27;s okay but u will feel the burn. The area around the skin will be red (may be even for 2 days). Caution for ppl with white skin, the redness may be significant. Wash with large amt of water and apply (I use Cetaphil (noncomedogenic)) moisturizer.    Not sure if its the resorcinol, but u&#x27;ll feel some vapor from the application. I recommend protecting ur eyes during application.     You will see visible peeling which u can pull off using tweezers. You will see this significantly on the 3-4th day. So, if u work u may wanna apply it on Wed and by Sun u r through with peeling.    Yes, its a bit irritating. But it seems effective. I am gonna continue using it and will post more later.   Good luck guys..!!!</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this one I felt like I have to. I previously bought a glycolic peel and glyco-lac peel but didn&#x27;t see much result with them.So I decide to switch to this and see how well it turns out and I definitely see some improvement this is my 2nd application. Definitely see my pores getting smaller and face smoother and softer. Both of my cheeks have like somewhat call icepick scars and lots of red marks as well with hyperpigmentation. The chemical smell of this is pretty intense and it was like really strong comparing to the others.  So I couldn&#x27;t leave it on for over 2 minutes. I&#x27;m not sure what people are using to put it on their face but I spread it with a cotton and it seem to be okay.  When I put foundation on my face to covers the flaws it doesn&#x27;t even show any flaws at all and it usually does with the bumpy skin and large pores. So all the scars are lighten up and improving much better and all the blemish are going away. My acne are under control I don&#x27;t break out anymore after using this peel so that&#x27;s a plus. Anyways I will update more when I&#x27;m on my 6th application. And I&#x27;m hoping to see more dramatic result. Everyone have different skin when it comes to chemical peels and sometimes it works and vice versa. Well Good luck to everyone who try this!</li>
    <li> I felt a burning sensation when I first applied it on my face. The first 30 seconds was almost unbearable but I tolerated through for 5 minutes. Very fine scabs started appearing on the third day. The results only starts to show on the sixth day when I felt a softer and smoother skin and also pigmented spots became lighter. I am on my third round now and I hope to see more better results appearing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this HQ+ gel peel.  A bit of background on my skin:  I&#x27;m 30, no sun damage, non smoker, no wrinkles that I&#x27;ve noticed, but I&#x27;ve had persistent mild to moderate acne since my early teens.  I have large pores, and blackheads on my nose and chin.  I use a 2% salicylic acid liquid on my face daily but I realized I needed something with more \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; to deal with acne and my pores.  Before using this peel, if I tried to \\&quot;express\\&quot; the blackheads on my chin, it was difficult to do and it would backfire on me and become huge inflamed blemishes.  I am also fair skinned, and acne would leave a red \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; of itself for a few weeks after the blemish itself had disappeared.  I also had a fair bit of redness around my nose... I do blow my nose a lot as I have allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my search for a peel with more \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; than my regular skin care routine, I first tried both the salicylic 20% and the glycolic 35% by Skin Laboratory, and didn&#x27;t really get any \\&quot;Wow, my skin looks great!\\&quot; results.  I&#x27;d done 3 peels of each of those two peels, fyi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered a bottle of the HQ+ peel.  In terms of my skin recovering from the HQ+ peel, my skin is red the first day (I do the peel in the morning), but the next day it&#x27;s glowing and the redness is gone.  Sometimes the skin around my nose will start sloughing/peeling 2-3 days after I do the peel (probably because that&#x27;s where my skin is most sensitive).  I may get some dryness around my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the bottle says \\&quot;gel peel\\&quot; but it isn&#x27;t a gel, it&#x27;s a liquid (doesn&#x27;t surprise me, there&#x27;s salicylic acid in this and it usually comes in the form of a liquid).  I wouldn&#x27;t really call it \\&quot;smelly\\&quot;, I&#x27;d say it just has quite a bit of fumes.  I can&#x27;t hold the cotton makeup pad I apply the peel with near my face for long because the fumes seem to take my breath away, so I apply the peel quickly as I can.  Keep this in mind if you are sensitive to smells or fumes.  Also, my skin is sensitive so this peel really feels like it&#x27;s burning, especially around my nose where the skin is thinnest.... to be able to tolerate the peel longer before I have to wash it off, I&#x27;ll sit in front of a fan or I&#x27;ll turn my hairdryer setting to \\&quot;Cool\\&quot; and blast cool air on my face.  That really helps the burning feeling subside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, now on to the results of the peel:  I&#x27;ve just finished my 6th peel (one peel per week, so it&#x27;s been 6 weeks), each one done for 3-5 minutes, but I&#x27;ll tell you I saw a difference after the first peel.  Two days after the first peel, I noticed that my skin had a lovely glow... not shiny, mind you, but just... glowing.  It wasn&#x27;t its usual blah self, normally I have to use a skin brightener with my makeup to get that effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My pores seem smaller and that glow lasts all week until the next peel.  It&#x27;s improved the red marks my acne leaves behind, and there&#x27;s a general more even tone to my skin.  Also, when I try and express blackheads on my chin (yes, I do still have them after doing this peel) they express easily and they don&#x27;t turn into huge blemish monsters!  I&#x27;ve also had no big blemishes since doing these peels, and only two or three tiny tiny blemishes that quickly go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased as punch with this peel.  No, it&#x27;s not laser resurfacing or a heavy duty peel, but the HQ+ peel is affordable and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin look like hamburger where I&#x27;d have to hide from people for weeks until I&#x27;d recovered.  And I&#x27;m young enough that I don&#x27;t need the \\&quot;big gun\\&quot; peels yet anyway.  For my poorly behaved pores, this stuff is doing the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2 weeks later: Something to note, I have to continue using this peel once a week to get the benefits of keeping my pores clear and blemish-free.  I tried to go 2 weeks before doing my 7th peel, and around day 11 into the 2 weeks, my pores were starting to misbehave and clog up again into a couple pimples, one on my chin and another on my forehead.  So on day 12 I did the HQ+ peel and the blemishes are already healing quite nicely the day after.  So, I&#x27;ll be planning to do this once a week.  Easy to do seeing as the redness fades quickly on me (even with my sensitive skin) and the bottle does a lot of peels, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve made much of a dent in this bottle even with 7 peels.icely the day after.  So, I&#x27;ll be planning to do this once a week.

    <li> Works great. My first time I did between 1-2 minutes with minimal peeling and great results. Second time I did a full 5 minutes, the next day my face was irritated around my mouth and close to my eyes.  These areas peeled, BUT the results were still great.  If you use the product for the full 5 minutes expect a few days of recovery.  Im sure the reaction is different for each person, but over all I am very satisfied with the results, reduced the appearance of fine lines and improved my overall skin tone reducing sun damage.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I plan to purchase it again as soon as possible. I have old scars left over from when i was a teenager, this was the first product i used that was gentle enough  and also worked great peeling the skin after using it on a regular basis..Thank you!! I can now where clothes without sleeves!!</li>
    <li> My skin really responded well to this.  I have only done it once, only left it one about 10 seconds, had some dryness after for about 10 days, a few breakouts, but now my does look and feel nice. For me it seemed to make my skin a bit oilier.  I will do it again soon and report my continued results..</li>
    <li> I used this product every week or so for about 8 months in an attempt to fade acne scars.  It definitely helped make progress.  Aveeno moisturizer helped make redness and irritation practically a non-issue, although there was definitely increased flakiness the next couple of days, especially noticeable when wearing make-up.  I agree with other reviewers that the smell is strong and the sensation is not pleasant, but nothing that I considered a problem as long as it was doing its job.    All of this would have been fine if there were not another alternative on the market- but I have now upgraded and am not turning back!  [[ASIN:B000F63TW0 Olay Regenerist MicroDermabrasion and Peel Kit]] is a miracle product by comparison.  It does a similar job of fading scars, but instead of making skin flaky, dull, and irritated, reveals a healthy, radiant glow!  I thought the most I could hope for was to fade my hyperpigmentation, but now I see my face is capable of so much better!  What&#x27;s more, it is also affordable and quick, but without that nasty smell.  Whatever your skin issues, check it out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old with oily, acne-prone skin. I have some sun damage, large pores, and mild scaring from acne. I&#x27;ve been going to a salon to get peels 2-3 times a year for the last few years. Lately I&#x27;ve cut back on the expense, but have been missing how great they made my skin look. I used to especially like getting the Jessner peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this peel isn&#x27;t as strong as the Jessner peel I&#x27;ve had done in the Salon, it is a good peel. I&#x27;ve used it once a week for 4 weeks. Each time I get some flaking on day 3 that lasts for a few days. I&#x27;ve been doing the peel on Sunday nights, and by the next Friday I look great! I&#x27;ve noticed slight improvements after each week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing that it takes 6 weeks for skin cells to completely turn-over, I&#x27;m excited to see how my skin improves over the next few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this product, but only if you&#x27;re not new to chemical peels. Otherwise, it can be quite scary. My boyfriend was watching me while I did it one night, and I said \\&quot;want to try?\\&quot; I brushed a bit on his face, and after about 10 seconds he was complaining about how strong it burned and wanted to rinse it off. He made some comment about how women are crazy to do that, yet he&#x27;s been complimenting me on my skin. go figure..</li>
    <li> I had developed melasma on my face, on my cheeks, forehead and my upper lip in the last few years. My doctor recommended five rounds of IPL laser treatments which would cost about $1,000. As I was saving up for the treatments, I started gathering information online about how to treat melasma at home. One of the recommendations was to get chemical peels. I started with peel level 1 from this brand, and it didn&#x27;t do much for my melasma although it helped my overall appearance of skin. Then I went straight to level 4 and after using it only once I saw results. I applied the liquid only on the parts where I have the darkening of the skin with a cotton pad, and I leave it for about 10-20 seconds. Then I rinsed it off with plenty of water. My skin was more red the first time I used it so I am assuming that my skin is getting adjusted. Hopefully next time I can leave it even longer. I use this peel in combination with skin lightening creams and my melasma is at least 50% gone. With creams alone I saw very little improvement. I highly recommend this peel not only for the treatment of melasma but my skin looks MUCH younger and brighter. I spend at least $8,000/year on beauty products and treatments and I have tried hundreds of different products ( I have many reviews even on amazon alone ), and nothing has made such a huge difference on my skin as much as using this peel did for me. The redness went away after 1 minute and I had almost no recovery time. Note - I did not experience \\&quot;peeling\\&quot; of the skin. I am not sure if the skin is supposed to regenerate through actual peeling of some kind, and maybe you would need to leave it on longer for that effect. I am getting the results that I want and more with only leaving it for 10-20 seconds on weekly basis. Since I only used it twice and got 50% reduction of the pigmentation, I am pretty sure that if I keep using it I will get even more off. But even as it is right now I am a million times happier about my face.</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews and the instructions I think I must have received a bottle with no chemicals in it at all.  It didn&#x27;t do a single thing.  In fact, I put it on and LEFT IT ON Overnight (against the instructions because of it&#x27;s irritants) and it still did nothing.  No redness, nada!</li>
    <li> Does not work.  I have used peels before and with this peel you don&#x27;t see peeling even after several uses.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical when I ordered this product... I&#x27;m 27 years old and have battled acne for about 15 years. I&#x27;ve been on everything from accutane (which worked but was harsh) to various face washes, benzoyl peroxides, etc.... I&#x27;ve tried it all. I scar very easily and have had moderate red scars, large pores and indentations from my past breakouts. I still break out occasionally but purchased this primarily for scars. I actually bought 2 products from this company, the glyco-lac 60 along with this HQ+ peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine:&lt;br /&gt;1st day: Left glyco-lac 60 on for 1 min. Moisturized with Cerave lotion (I prefer the one in the tub)&lt;br /&gt;4 days later: Left glyco-lac 60 on for 2 mins. Moisturized with Cerave lotion.&lt;br /&gt;After this, I already noticed a difference in my skin. My makeup was going on smoother and I could see my marks weren&#x27;t as noticable.&lt;br /&gt;4 days later: Used HQ+ peel. Left on for 1 minute. This peel was much stronger and burned more than the glyco-lac peel. Make sure you use lotion with SPF, and try not to wear makeup the next day to allow your skin to heal. I will wait 7 days to use the glyco-lac again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a reduction in my pore size, overall smoother skin and can see my scars beginning to fade. The pimples I had are slowly fading. I even noticed the wrinkles on my forehead are not as obvious. I am going to stick with this routine but would recommend this to anyone with acne/scars.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know whether to laugh or cry! I have been battling moderate acne for 25 years. When I was on the pill for a few years, it went away, but I have hypothyroidism now and the estrogen makes my synthroid not work, so I can&#x27;t take it. TMI, I know.    Before I started using it, the term \\&quot;acid\\&quot; sounded painful to me, so I was too scared to have a peel done, much less do it myself. Well, I&#x27;m so glad I changed my mind!! This stuff is a Godsend! I&#x27;m actually kind of upset that I didn&#x27;t know about it sooner, because it would have saved me so much stress, seclusion and scars! Ugh!! Why oh why????    Anyway, I have not had a zit since I started using this stuff. Seriously! I don&#x27;t know how well it works for wrinkles because I don&#x27;t really have many, but if you have acne, you MUST purchase this stuff. My scars are definitely smoother! (Follow the directions, of course.)    I use it once a week, although the directions say to use it less often. I thought I had sensitive skin, but I don&#x27;t find this to be that irritating at all. That said, when I first starting using it, I made sure that my skin was dry and hadn&#x27;t been washed recently, so my skin wasn&#x27;t too soft. I did the peel once a week for a few weeks and didn&#x27;t have any irritation or even redness or peeling. I have since started doing it after I get out of the shower when my face is moist. It tingles a little more now but it&#x27;s fine. Little bit of peeling. No redness. I use a soft make-up brush to apply it. I wait a few minutes, then wash it off. Definitely apply a moisturizer after. I use Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisturizer for Sensitive Skin. Hope I didn&#x27;t leave anything out. I am just so thankful that I found this. I&#x27;m so glad my children won&#x27;t have acne like I did!    It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you have acne, just make sure you&#x27;re very careful. I&#x27;m so tempted to tell strangers with acne to try this stuff, but am not sure how to approach. I&#x27;ll figure it out because it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;d rather be embarrassed for trying tohelp someone than because I have a huge zit any day!!    I&#x27;ve used this peel up and am about to get another bottle!!! Try it!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product so far!!! I applied the HQ peel 4 days ago, and each morning I see my skin better and better, I really like the results. It is a good product for people with hormonal acne like me.     Make sure you read all the instructions before your first application, because there are certain products like retin A, that you should not apply 2 days before applying the peeling.</li>
    <li> Two peels and I must say my skin is looking better. Just a nice soft glow to my skin that wasn&#x27;t there before. My skin seems to drink up moisturizer better now instead of it just sitting on top of my skin. Pores look smaller and discolorations just a tad lighter, if any. I&#x27;ve used it 7 days apart, and it does frost a little on my skin. It really doesn&#x27;t burn that much. I&#x27;ve left it on for 2 and 4 minutes. I must say it seems to be doing something.</li>
    <li> WARNING, DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM \\&quot;Skin Laboratory\\&quot; !!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been meaning to write this review for a while. I was sent this bottle with probably nothing but rubbing alcohol in it.&lt;br /&gt;I left it on for an hour and it did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT ALL!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Judging from other customer reviews, this company has a habit of sending people placebo peels that are nothing but alcohol every so often, maybe when they run out and are too lazy and careless.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t take a chance!</li>
    <li> I have oily complexion, that&#x27;s probably why it doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin. Worked real good at getting rid of spots and scars. Was strong odor and sometimes burned.</li>
    <li> Great results for severe melasma after only 6 weeks of use! I will be ordering more when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> Why pay a doctor for one treatment what you can get a bottle which will last you several dozen treatments. This stuff works. It&#x27;s strong, so use it with caution and only leave it on for a very short time the first couple of times you use it (as per directions).</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, but as mentioned with any chemical/ acid peels, if you are of African American or Black descendants be very careful using this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I am a 29 year old female and I had acne until my early 20s. I was left with acne scars and hyperpigmentation, which is why i bought this product about 4 months ago. I was a little apprehensive because of the Hydroquinone it contains but decided to give it a try anyways. I followed the instructions carefully, I used it every 10 days and would leave the product on the maximum amount of time which is 4 minutes. I experienced VERY little frosting. It does sting, but it is mild. My skin got red for a few minutes but there was almost no flaking. The skin feels very clean and tight, the pores feel smaller. The skin looks vibrant for like a week but that&#x27;s about it. I havent noticed ANY difference on my acne scars or any improvement on my complexion. According to the makers of this product \\&quot;The HQ+ peel is formulated specifically with pigmentation in mind because it has added ingredients which help to fade pigmentation differences and even skin tone. If you suffer form old acne marks, age spots, or melasma, this peel will be the most effective in helping you.\\&quot; I was not expecting a miracle or anything but I would expect to see at least some improvement, if not with my scars, at least for it to even out my skin tone. Overall I am disappointed with this product. I have tried the oil of olay regenerist microdermabrasion and peel system and have gotten better results for a fraction of the price. I will not be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> This peel did not hurt me at all,but I am used to 20% salicylic acid. I have melasma and have no luck with pretty much anything. I was on here to reorder salicylic acid because its the only solution that cleanses INSIDE your pores and I have struggled with breakouts my whole life. Then I read more info on all the different solutions offered by this company and I thought id take a chance on it. I have to admit I&#x27;m a lil OCD so applying it everyday, even after breakouts my skin was (where I applied on breakouts) was SO DRY and scaly it hurt. I couldn&#x27;t put enough of any moisturizing product on it to fix my mistake. It took about 4 or 5 days. But after that I was relieved I didn&#x27;t make it worse, and I noticed significant improvement in my melasma (ALWAYS USE SUNSCREEN after, or any treatment for melasma is pointless!) I then read a great review on hylauronic acid (with a dropper). I bought that too. In the review it said to use derma e glycolic.......... Cleanser follow up with a couple drops of this in your moisturizer, then apply a spritz of rosé water. I have to admit I thought this chic was getting paid for this crazy review, but I bought it! Why, not because I have the money to buy all this stuff, but because for some stupid reason I always hold out hope, just to be EXTREMELY disappointed. My parents have also bought me stuff looking for the miracle acne treatment to no avail. I used to feel bad like I failed them when I couldn&#x27;t fix it. Then I had my own kids (which is when I got melasma ) and I got over my own guilt. However now my kids are at that brutally honest age, and I&#x27;ve come to realize my journey to fix my skin isn&#x27;t really just about me. If my daughter has the same struggles that I do, I need to find a solution so she doesn&#x27;t have to  go through what I have.i think for me I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect combination! It&#x27;s been a mth but everything&#x27;s looking way better. I ALMOST feel comfortable in my own skin just as,it was meant to be.</li>
    <li> I have used the glycolic peel and the glycolic/lactic acid peel from this company and love both of them and have gotten wonderful results using them. But I got this peel hoping that it would be a stronger peel that would do as it said and fade the light pigmented spots I have from the sun. I&#x27;ve used it several times now and the only thing I can say is it really, really stinks and doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything. It smells like gasoline and takes my breath away when I put it on. It doesn&#x27;t burn or turn my skin pink at all, not like the other two peels I have used. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel soft and tighter or softer as when I used the their other peels. It does seem to dry my skin more so if you have oily skin it will take care of that. I have dryer skin so maybe this is not the product for me. But now what to do about my sun spots??</li>
    <li> This peel is pretty strong, it does a terrific job of getting rid of dark spots and acne spots.  Using this with a micordermabrasion machine really causes your skin to glow and with regular use the difference in your skin is amazing.  Love this product, 2nd purchase!</li>
    <li> 1/2 teaspoon of HQ peel to an eight bowl, enough for the whole body.&lt;br /&gt;I mixed this with Indian healing clay couple of drops of vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;and tea tree oil. I mixed oils and hot water and add the clay mix&lt;br /&gt;a little at a time with a tint or relaxer brush to chop down until&lt;br /&gt;smooth, apply immediately for that warm aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a woman of color with very thin skin due to aging(50+).&lt;br /&gt;I read a lot of women said it burned their skin me too did not last&lt;br /&gt;a minute before I felt the burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did my skin remove it&#x27;s dull skin the tightness was fastastic. I have adult acne and ezema the mud and the oil protected&lt;br /&gt;my skin. I was in a warm shower for 20 minutes removing my old skin&lt;br /&gt;use your hands not a towel or sponge rub softly and you will feel the&lt;br /&gt;dead skin rubbing off. Be created use your own oils and aroma with&lt;br /&gt;the clay. ENJOY your personal spa.</li>
    <li> I had more than expected darkening of my skin after pulsed laser skin rejuvenation (on Asian skin). Also had accidentally rubbed off some skin during the first few days of healing process. So after letting my skin heal for almost three weeks I began using HQ+ with their instructions and post application regimen. But only once every two weeks, the first time for 2 minutes the second for 3 minutes. No excessive redness nor irritation resulted.. (I&#x27;ve only done two peels in the 6 weeks after my laser procedure or two within the 4 weeks I&#x27;ve used the product). I am very pleased with HQ+. I don&#x27;t feel I need to peel deeply so I will probably continue but with 2 minutes of application. It seems to be very effective and after the flaking, the skin underneath doesn&#x27;t seem as red (as with 3 mins) but heals very nicely with even tone for my Asian skin.</li>
    <li> I think this is quite effective. I have not seen any significant help with pigmentation or sun spots yet, but it def keeps my skin clearer, brighter and healthier. FYI, this has 2% Hydroquinone which is considered safe. I have used the glycolic peel by this company, and I think this is a little stronger. But I saw no frosting or excessive redness. The difference is that some mild peeling happens immediately (resist the temptation and don&#x27;t pull).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some drawbacks:&lt;br /&gt;-It stinks terribly. It contains benzene or something like that. I can feel my lungs burn when I inhale the fumes. Not good! Manufacturer PLEASE use a healthier base, or I will never purchase this again!&lt;br /&gt;-It dries the skin at first (esp around the mouth).</li>
    <li> Pretty good product! I have a lot of sun damage (brown spots) on my face and it has lightened them considerably. I still have a ways to go. This is a rather gentle product for home use.</li>
    <li> I think that it depends on your skin type and whether or not you have had professional peels. I did not notice a difference after using this product other than my face was a little red  and dry afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the process my eyes felt dry and irritated. Every body has a different skin type and will respond different. I have combination skin and have had several professional peels.</li>
    <li> I have been using this peel for about 4 months now and am impressed with my results.  I didn&#x27;t want to review this product until I have used it for a significant amount of time, so that I can give others a true and accurate review of this product.     I would have to say that it took about a month before I really started to see results. I have hereditary acne and have used a lot of OTC and prescription medications. This peel has worked better at keeping my acne under control than most of the medications I have used over the years.    I haven&#x27;t really broken out since using this peel and the hydroquinone in it has really helped with most of the dark scars I had from previous breakouts.  It does dry out your skin, so you will definitely need to use a good oil free moisturizer and sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I have used this product just two times, applying it every 8 days.The first time i used it I felt the tingly on my face that everybody has experimented, but it didn&#x27;t feel hard to handle, so I left it for 5 minutes, washed my face and applied cetaphil facial moisturizer, I really did not see any difference in my skin, but when i used it the second time 8 days later I felt more burning even though I kept it 5 minutes, and the other day I have realized that some of the scars that I have from acne were dissapearing, I am talking about \\&quot;hole type\\&quot; scars and the pores on my nose looked more tiny, I didn&#x27;t see any difference on the queloid scars. So i am waiting to use this product again and see the final results.</li>
    <li> This product has cleared up a lot of my uneven skin tone and gave my skin a nice smooth look. It is not for those with sensitive skin so you must follow the instructions or listen to your skin if it begins to feel uncomfortable (wash it off). You will peel, so I would recommend using it on a Thurs or Friday night. I used it around my mouth and elbows to lighten them, since I am of darker complexion (cappucino color). My chin area was more sensitive to it, but it worked. I used Eucerin Healing Ointment the day after to keep those areas moisturized and to help the peeling look and feel less irritating.</li>
    <li> Im 24 yrs old ive had acne since i was 13 ive tried otc products, prescribed, peels and lasers, so i after reading some reviews on this product i decided to purchase it, it is a strong peel, it really stings when applied, the next day my face looked better, and when my family and friends saw my face they all said my face looked better, the 2nd time i used it there was a difference the next day, so far i have used it twice, its very easy to use, i highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Hello I am 17 years old and have mild/moderate acne and have oily skin. At first I had bought the smaller version of the Hq+ peel and wrote a review about it on this website. But after using the product more, I now have a lot of mixed feelings about this product.  Pro&#x27;s:   -The only over-the-counter product that has faded my post-acne marks(little red dots)  -Gets rid of some active pimples  _________________________________________________________________________________  Con&#x27;s:  -Broke my skin out with a lot of red pimples.  - The smell of the product gives me a very intense headache during and after applying it to my skin.  -Dries my skin out so badly that it causes my skin to produce more oil.  _________________________________________________________________________________  It breaks my skin out with a lot of red pimples: When I first started using this peel, I did not break out from it. I started breaking out the 6th or 7th time of use. I thought that the break-outs came from the peel just getting all the \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; out of my pores, which is suppose to happen the first couple of uses. Well I kept using the peel once every 10 days and following the directions exactly. I did not put any new skin products on my skin at the time or do anything different with my skin routine. But I still broke out will pimples the day after each peel. I didn&#x27;t understand why my skin would still be breaking out after using the peel as many times as I have. Now I know how some of you must be thinking \\&quot;She doesn&#x27;t know for sure that it is the products fault for her skin breaking out\\&quot;. But when I break-out only when I use this product and only breaking out in the ONLY places(I don&#x27;t apply to entire face, just certain little spots) I apply the peel, then yes I have to say the peel is at fault.</li>
    <li> okay, so i bought this peel about 2 months ago, waiting for a long weekend to try it, in case i peeled alot.  Read all the review 5 times and was really hesitant to try it.  I have an olive complexion and some age dark spots and dark circles and many lines under my eyes.  I am 44 and a smoker but i have good skin and no acne problems.  I applied it sparingly and it stung just a little around my nose.  Could have left it on for 5 minutes but only left it on for 30 seconds as recommended for the first time.  After washing it off my face felt tighter and smoother.  I didnt peel at all, though my skin was visibly better, smaller pores and fine lines improved.  8 weeks later, I did it a second time, left it on for about 3 minutes and used more so my face was pretty wet with the stuff, it stung like crazy, but i wanted better results. After about a minute with the peel on, my face turned a ghostly white.  I had to rinse for a good 3 minutes to get the burning to stop.  Next day, skin looks amazing...waiting for the peel..will update again.</li>
    <li> This product is really strong. I am warning to those people out there who thinks you guys have developed tolerance against peeling. Man, honestly speaking i&#x27;ve experienced alot of peels from doctors and myself(loreal peel) and this thing aint like things that you&#x27;ve probably seen. You apply this on a cotton(roughly about 2drops of it) and it will PEEL YOUR SKIN after a few days. my first day was ok but the second day, my skin started peeling like crazy, and third day the place where i applied too much chemical had a crack and bled a bit). i have had acne since 6th grade and im over 20 now and this thing... I think its the strongest chemical peel i&#x27;ve ever experienced after 10 years of different peels. I dont know how good this thing works but after 3 days im starting to see better contour and texture after the skin peeled. the product has a warning to USE IT EVERY 10 DAYS OR MORE and apply moisturizer lotion after the peel.</li>
    <li> Lets just say, level 4 is the real deal and its great and all, but not for inexperience people because it&#x27;s so strong. and dont use it two days in a row&#x3D;bad</li>
    <li> Great product. They need to sell a bigger bottle. My skin is very sensitive, but it did not hurt my skin. I bought this with the glycolic acid, and can use each of them once a week on separate days. It does everything it says it will do. I would like to buy a bottle larger than 30 ml.</li>
    <li> I have used another peel (beta hydroxy) from Skin Laboratory, and I am so impressed with their products. I showed the other to my dermatologist, and she commented that it&#x27;s just a weaker version of what she uses; she basically gave it her stamp of approval. So I was excited to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As background, I&#x27;m in my mid-40s and have some weird brown patches. They occurred months after I went through chemotherapy at 39. Last summer I wasn&#x27;t as fastidious as I should have been in reapplying SPF in the pool, so those patches sudden became much darker and very noticeable. So I started using this peel with hopes it would fade the brown patches. It worked very well and basically got them back to the pre-summer darkness level (not sure how else to explain it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spring I&#x27;ve been really determined to eradicate those patches altogether without having to spend money for a doctor&#x27;s office chemical peel. This is how I use the product: I start off by exfoliating my skin. I would not recommend this first if you haven&#x27;t already tried the product. Exfoliating first will cause a more dramatic result (i.e., more burning). I then pour the peel liquid into a small glass bowl. I pour just enough so that I can add more if necessary but will not waste any of the product. I use a fan brush to apply it. I avoid the corners of my nose and mouth, because the skin there is too sensitive and will crack and peel terribly (I believe there&#x27;s even a warning to avoid these areas). I do my whole face and then rinse after a few minutes. There is little to no frosting (if you&#x27;re not sure what this is, do some googling about frosting with chemical peels). On occasion, I will go back after I&#x27;ve rinsed my entire face and reapply to just those stubborn areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MORE is not better. I do not do this more often than the bottle recommends because skin needs time to heal and turn over. I follow the peel up with copious amounts of cool water. Then I do use a light moisturizer. I have problem skin (even went on a round of Accutane in my mid-30s for cystic acne) that is oily, especially in the T-zone, so I keep the moisturizer pretty light. I also use a tinted moisturizer for days after the peel since my skin is dry and has some minimal flaking/peeling. I also use a dark spot lightener from Paula&#x27;s Choice; I do that once or twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference with following this routine has been marked. My spots have faded to where they can be covered with a good full-coverage foundation. I expect they will be eradicated entirely if I keep to this routine. It IS the long route compared to a heavy duty peel you might get at a dermatologist&#x27;s office, but it&#x27;s oodles cheaper and doesn&#x27;t result in downtime and missed days from work. I highly recommend this if you&#x27;re patient and willing to do the rest -- regularly use products that will help fade brown spots, use a good exfoliant (chemical or manual), and use sun protection religiously.have problem skin (even went on a round of Accutane in my mid-30s for cystic acne) that is oily, especially in the T-zone, so I keep the moisturizer pretty light.

    <li> This product has truly improved my skin.  My issues WERE ingrown hairs and shaving bumps which both resulted in hyper-pigmentation of my skin.  This product has significantly faded my hyper-pigmentation and, because of the exfoliation ingredients, stopped my ingrown hairs and shaving bumps from occurring.  I use it every 5 days and use noxzema facial wash and salicylic acid pads daily. I&#x27;m hoping all the years of hyper-pigmentation have faded by the summer and I can switch to using it once a month to maintain the results.  I&#x27;ve used every skin lightener for hyer-pigmentation and shaving bump product for the last 14 years and none have gotten the results that hq+ peel has in only 1 month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 4 months and wanted to wait a while before I wrote any reviews.  I have VERY oily skin and had pretty bad acne growing up, I do have some acne scarring.  I decided to try this to see if anything, maybe would help decrease some of the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of the other reviews I&#x27;ve read talk about a burning when applied, it was more of a sting for me.  After the first time I used it I noticed my skin cleared up within a few days.  Over the course of the months, it has helped clear up the excessive oil on my face.  I do still have breakouts, but I&#x27;d say this really did help my skin look overall clearer and more radiant.  I was hoping I would see a difference in my scarring but not much has changed there.  I will probably continue using this.</li>
    <li> I am half asian, half white male with a lot of old acne scars, but no active acne.  My skin has a lot of indents with hyper pigmentation.  This is my first time using any sort of peel.  Here is my experience with the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treatment 1:&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: I received LEVEL 4, just like many other users have noted.  I ignored the warning of not to shave 24 hours before.  I applied the product in the recommended fashion, first my forehead working down my left cheek, then up my right cheek, and some on my nose.  Immediately after applying it began to sting, but I toughed it out and left it on for 3 minutes before dunking my head into a sink of cool water and then gently splashed more water on my face.  My cheeks had frosted, but after some more rinsing started to regain their normal color.  My skin felt alright, and my face was a little red, but not much different than normal.  I applied moisturizer and some sun screen, not that I get much sun anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2: I woke up the next day and my face felt funny like the skin was tight.  I looked in the mirror and my face was completely red, especially my cheeks.  It was obvious that my skin was really tight because I could hardly physically force a smile in a mirror, much less any other emotion.  Luckily I knew for a fact that other than a job interview in a five days, I didn&#x27;t need to be anywhere.  Surely it would heal by that interview.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 3: My face feels like leather and the redness has become darker.  My cheeks are starting to peel, but I&#x27;m not going to force it.  Remaining calm, still have four days until job interview.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 3 1/2: I couldn&#x27;t help it.  I felt trapped in my house, I had to take a bath and soak my face.  It loosened a lot of the tight skin and I could see skin flakes coming off as I gently massaged my face with my finger tips.  Yeah, I know I should have let it come off naturally.  After the bath the skin under the areas that had peeled off looked noticeably smoother, and my face as a whole look like I had a bad sun burn(but not made out of leather as previously).  After drying off and applying moisturizer/sunscreen my face appeared at least presentable.  I was still flaking.  After this I made a promise to myself that I would only do 2 minutes for my next treatment and work my way up from there(cutting the time I leave it on the skin by 1/3 for those that are bad at math).  I would also wait until Day 10 before beginning treatment 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 4: After taking a shower I looked in the mirror, my acne scars were much shallower.  The redness has mostly subsided, but I&#x27;m still peeling in areas.  At this point I&#x27;m reasonably happy with the result and will definitely try further treatments.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the full results after a full 6 treatments.had a bad sun burn(but not made out of leather as previously).

    <li> I have tried ALL the home peels - this is by far the best! It is also less harsh. I cannot rate this peel enough. As with all peels you will look worse before better but the downtime is way less than the others.I applied NIA24 skin strengthening complex straight after which is what (good) dermatologists give you after professional peels.  FYI I ALWAYS PREP the day before with salicylic acid to get the best and more effective peel.... one more thing - leave on for 4 mins, it didn&#x27;t hurt one bit and I frosted straight away!</li>
    <li> I was always out of door without any sunscreen to protect my bare face. I learnt my lesson well. At the age of 46, l am seeing uninvited guests of freckles, dark spots visiting and staying on my cheeck. I went on Amazon to search for a lightening agent and l came across this peel. Most reviews are positive ones so l decided to give it a try. I felt nothing except tingling, burning sensation the 1st time l applied. But the 2nd time l applied was 4 days after my laser treatment (so you can see how desperate l am). This time in addition to the tingling, burning sensation, my skin peels. 3 flakes of dead old skin came off like scales. My face looks a lot brighter. I was happy and didnt mind the scale like peeling. I had my 3rd application last week, the peel continues for a few days though not in scales. My dark spots are still there but not as dark. I dont know if it is due to the peeler or the laser or the skin whitener l am use or the combination of all 3. Thats the reason l gave this product only 4 stars. I should not forget to mention this peel is also light enough not to cause reddening like lobster shell that would embarres you to go anywhere the very next day. Nevertheless my entire skin is whiter, lighter, brighter, fresher and younger...</li>
    <li> So I got the product 5 days ago, kind of scrd, but I tried it on my nose, it stinged bad, but washed it off it was okay,.. I have some discloation oin my lip around my mouth, im indian I have olivey skin so it very noticeable, 2 days ago I took a q-tip and started to apply it on my lip, around my mouth within secound it started to frost :( and burned and boy it it burn :( and i washed and washed and washed for about 10 mins, and a day later I looked like soemone burned me waxing, and today 2nd day I Look like my skin is peeling .. not sure, I was picking at it :( I dont know, people say it gets worse, before it gets better, I would tell anyone who hasnt use this, to use allot of aloe vera after very recomended, I see a little peeling on my nose, I have allot of black heads, really scrd for my lip.. I also have a skin condition where I have black velvety patches under my arm pits and back of my neck and back, so I tried some hq on the back of my neck, and the patches dried up and flaked off so that was a plus!!!, I will post a update, for now this product is a 2 !!! if you try this product make sure you take a week off, you do not want to go in public like this!!!</li>
    <li> my skin just burned with this and the salic acid by the company.  it will work well with not so sensitive skin. just be careful you don&#x27;t burn your skin!</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping for a more intense chemical peel than my home remedies... but I had been using a 50/50 mix of vinegar and witch hazel as a toner, and honestly, this stuff is not much stronger! I couldn&#x27;t feel a burn at all and even though the instructions say to rinse it off after 4 minutes, I found I could leave it on a lot longer without any redness or discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I will say, I was not using this on my face so maybe that&#x27;s why it seems so much weaker than expected. I was instead applying it to my chest and shoulders to try to reduce sun damage and freckles there. Maybe it&#x27;s intense enough for the face, but I say it&#x27;s probably a waste of money!</li>
    <li> Keep in mind when buying this product not to expect it to be as strong as a doctor office prescribed chemical peel. It is a good product to purchase for occasional home use. They sent this product pretty quick to me. It made my face burn just slightly, but my face felt tighter. I really liked it.       I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Was not very strong. If your skin is suppose to peel my skin failed to do so. It didn&#x27;t even tingle after leaving it on for almost an hour.</li>
    <li> this stuff is magic.If your starting to get a zit,just put the HQ on it and by morning,no more zit.I have brown spots from the sun and they are almost gone.You cant go nuts with it,your face drys out and will peel.I will never be without it.</li>
    <li> I am a 31 y/o black female with medium tone skin. My skin tends to be oily in the summer but normal during the winter. I purchased this product to help with some acne scaring on my forehead and cheek. I also have large pores around my nose that I was hoping this would help reduce the appearance of. I have been using the product for about one month (in combination with the Neutrogena home derm kit). The acne scaring on my forehead has lightened slightly (about 25%) but has not gone away. The acne scarring on my cheek in now 50% lighter and some spots have even disappeared. I am very happy that it has helped reduce the appearance of the pores around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this with a Q-tip on dark spots and use an SPF75 or greater if I have to leave the house after using. Overall I am happy with the product, for the number of uses the price is reasonable. I am reluctant to go to a higher dosage for faster results because I think it would do more harm than good, so I have started MSM and silica supplements to help the process along. This product can be somewhat drying so I usually apply some type of sun screen (I now use as a moisturizer) after even if I am not leaving the house.</li>
    <li> I used this the other day and really didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  It does exactly as described.  I will continue to use it as directed.  This is not for the teenage girl trying to fix her complexion as she could seriously hurt herself.  I am glad that I read all warnings and cautions before I used it.  I am getting exactly what I needed out of this product.</li>
    <li> I have previously used the Salicylic Acid peel and I must say HQ+ is a much stronger peel. Make sure you follow the instructions to avoid any unnecessary damage to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 1 - First Application: I first washed my face and used witch hazel to clean my skin thoroughly. I applied the peel w/ a cotton swab all over my face avoiding eye and lips area. Since this was my first time using the HQ+ peel, washed it off with lots of water after 1 and a half minutes. My cheeks were red like they were sun burnt. I applied Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizer. All the redness was gone by morning and the only difference I noticed was that my skin was tighter.  It&#x27;s been 2 days since I applied the peel and I have seen very little peeling. I am going to increase the contact time to 2-2.5 minutes next time. I will update my review every week to see if I notice any significant improvements.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for the latest and greatest potions and lotions to keep my 40-something pores and wrinkles at bay. I&#x27;ve been using this consistently - each week for the last two months or so. I LOVE IT. It has removed small skin tags, lightened my melasma, reduced my pores on nose and in t-zone, plus a 75% reduction in the fine lines and wrinkles in the crows feet area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the skin labs products off an on for about 5 years including the glycolic and salicylic peels. Although those also worked well, my skin has changed over the years and now this HQ peel is definitely the one that is working best for me at this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my method: I do a salicylic scrub on my face first (I use the proactive body bar with a scrubby pad) as sort of a &#x27;prep&#x27; before my peel. I suspect I could probably use my skin labs salicylic peel, too. Pat dry. Once dry, I apply the HQ+ peel with a makeup brush... I tend to make two passes in order to get a nice layer that isn&#x27;t too thin. I leave on for four minutes, then rinse for 2 minutes with lukewarm water. Again, I pat dry. I then apply major amounts of moisturizer (I&#x27;ve found an Hyaluronic Acid that I add to my moisturizer to give my skin an extra boost of hydration!). I moisturize probably every 2-4 hours in the first 24 hours post-peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not experienced any peeling or discoloration using the above method. I have had small peeling around my nostrils, but is was not noticeable. Enjoy and good luck! This stuff is worth every penny and I wish I had started using it ten years ago.</li>
    <li> Though a little skeptical at first, I had nothing to lose. My first application of this product I was unsure as to its affects, with little redness and no noticeably peeling. All I had in mind was that I had just applied water and alcohol to my face. With a few days passing I noticed my face had a  slightly better look to the acne scars i wished to rid of (applying with a q-tip) but nothing spectacular at first. After two weeks passing and three or four applications ( was more aggressive due to only spot treatment) I see a very considerable difference to my appearance as well as the deminishing of the old scars that i had so long fought against for years! This product not only helped with my face but it also saved me most likely $1000 or more if I had gone to the dermatologist. Im not the type to go and write reviews for anything but i&#x27;ve had such great result I felt like I had at least had to share this awesome treasure. Though this product has great wonders, I still would recommend precaution to anyone new to this, for different people have different skin, so everyones skin reacts different. So I would say to first apply somewhere that isn&#x27;t very visible</li>
    <li> Having suffered from the effects of acne and subsequent scarring as result of a neurotic tendency to rub and pop and scratch at the byproducts of hormonal teenage acne, I found myself depressed and lacking all confidence in my appearance.  Before I found this product on Amazon, I made the unfortunate mistake of paying $500+ for a professional facial peel, which is no different than applying this stuff once every week or once every other week.  Do pay attention to the strength of the peel -- although this particular product does seem to come at one strength -- other peels such as lactic acid and glycolic acid peels come in various concentrations, implying the strength of the overall acid in the bottle which has much to do with how deep into the skin you are attempting renew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a male of biracial origin with black and white parents and for my skin I can use a 60% peel, though I would not recommend starting at this concentration.  Even I began at 30% concentration before finding my way to this particular peel after using a 30% lactic acid peel and then 60% glycolac peel (30% lactic acid, 30% glycolic acid).  These peels will burn at some point during the application, and this product in particular -- in addition to the burning -- will cause a white frothing of the skin with some minor bubbles that may form if allowed to set for too long.  These products only suggest leaving the solution on for no more than 30 seconds, which is a very good starting point, however you will find as your skin becomes more tolerant and less sensitive to the peel, that a longer application time may be necessary to achieve similar results found in the earliest applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to expect following an application:  1-2 days will show minor improvement in the complexion of the skin.  2-5 days will appear as if you&#x27;ve taken one step forward and two steps back.  Your skin won&#x27;t look as fleshy and full as it will in the coming days.  DO NOT be alarmed.  Things will get better.  Sometimes things need to get worse before they can get better.  5-7 days your complexion will begin to clear and you will again find a youthful ruddy glow to the skin you might have once thought impossible to regain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caring for your face following an application:  Wash with a very mild cleanser, morning and night.  Cetaphil gentle cleanser works great for me!  DO NOT use and exfoliating cleanser!  These are rough and could damage the skin instead of improve it.  Also, only use a facial moisturizer for the week following an application.  Put this on morning and night following a wash.  DO NOT expose your face to direct sunlight following an application.  If you are going to be in the sun, make sure to use an spf 50 or above sunscreen on top of your moisturizer.  I am not joking about this last point.  Sunscreen is very important.  The sun is the most harmful thing to your skin when attempting to improve it; it will make dark blemished darker -- faster!  Kind of how people with browner complexions tan quicker.  Same principle, only those blemishers you are looking to lessen will become more pronounced.  Finally, following the week of cleansing and moisturizing, introduce a serum of some sort into your regimen (OLAY makes a good inexpensive anti-aging serum that is fragrance free).  I suggest OLAY.  The serum helps to nourish the skin and will further enhance the affects of peel without having to use the peel any more frequently than once every other week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you use 70% alcohol to remove oils from the skin before each application as well as after each application.  Splash water on to your face after the alcohol to ensure all of the peel is removed; this will prevent unwanted chemical burns, which are possible if all directions are not followed properly.  And these, I&#x27;m afraid are much more difficult to correct.  This peel is a fantastic way to correct skin imperfections when used properly.  Please use it properly or don&#x27;t use it atall.  You will only be even more discouraged if you don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I decided to do a peel at home.  I was a bit nervous, but thought &amp;#34;how hard can it be?&amp;#34;  I must say that I am not a newbie to peels.  I have done a few at the medspa, but tired of paying so much.  I also use Retin A freqently, so my skin is used to being roughed up a bit.  I was able to use it for the full 4 minutes on the first use, with only mild stinging.  I have used it once every 10 days for the last month, and my skin looks brighter and smoother.  I got mild peeling (kind of a milky look that scrubbed off) but I did not expect a whole lot as I exfoliate regularly and have had a peel in the past 2 months.  I will definetly continue to use this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing w/acne since I&#x27;d my son 13yrs ago. I&#x27;ve tried acutane 2x&#x27;s, many chemical peels for which I&#x27;ve paid $135.00 PER peeling, ouch...it hurts to know that I&#x27;ve waisted so much money on peels. I saw my dermatologist use a plastic cup that looked like the ones that come w/the otc cold medicines.She uses just a bit and charges $135.00&gt;&gt;&gt;she&#x27;s making good money! Well, I&#x27;m so glad I found this product,I started using it about 2wks ago, and I really have noticed a big difference in the way my skin looks, because I&#x27;ve scars from acne is going to take a few more uses for my facial skin to look better. I&#x27;ve to say, that I&#x27;ve only used it as spot treatment. I&#x27;ve not use it like the instructions says, because I&#x27;ve a busy schedule and I don&#x27;t want to peel like a snake since I&#x27;m around people; but I love the idea that I&#x27;ve control of how much I peel, because I know how my skin is, due to having many...many...many... peels at the dermatologist office. I can tell you that this bottle WILL last me for a good 3 to 6 months or may be even more! If you&#x27;re sick and tired of having to wear heavy make-up to cover up your skin imperfections, give this peel a try&gt;&gt;&gt;my facial skin is oily, so this one seems to work great for me. MAKE SURE you buy the one that will work better for your skin type. I wish you all good SKIN :)</li>
    <li> I love Skin Laboratory and have been using their products for over 7yrs. I&#x27;ll be 47 next month and still get carded for cigarettes. Yes, I smoke and have for more years then I&#x27;d care to admit, but I have absolutely NO wrinkles around my mouth, eyes....well, anywhere. At 40yrs of age, I had crows feet, and fine lines all the way around my mouth. My \\&quot;laugh\\&quot; lines were pretty obvious too. At first, I used the gel peel every 7 days. I&#x27;ve added a few of their other products and alternate back and forth. My other current favorite is the Lactic/70. At this point I&#x27;m only using one or the other every 3 to 4 weeks. Takes just a few minutes and I&#x27;m out the door. If you&#x27;re new at this, please start with the 20 or 30 and build your way up and only do the treatment at night so the redness will go away by morning. I&#x27;ve used it so long, I can use the 70 and leave for work within minutes. I&#x27;ve tried professionals. They could not do better than this, but please be patient and go slowly. It&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever found a product that does exactly what promised, like this product does.  When I got into my 40s, adult acne surfaced with a vengeance, and this keeps it under control.</li>
    <li> The product does not lighten dark spots as it was meant to do , just burns the skin and smells like chemical</li>
    <li> work perfect i see the change inmediatly my skin have couple sun spots but in few days complety dessapear&lt;br /&gt;excelent product , come on time</li>
    <li> This is a very strong peel its really stings and burn the face a lot but is safe for my skin, it help me with the oil, my acne and has brighten my skin, still got some hyperpigmentation around my chin hopefully its gonna fade soon, I have been using this peel for about 4 weeks now, I have notice a lot clear face. I use it at night every week, then I moisture my face and in the mornings a lot of sun block. I was using this peel with a cotton ball which I regret know is way better if you use a fan brush, with the fan brush I experience the white frosting and with the cotton ball didnt. I hope that in the next 4 weeks I could see my face blemish free.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t all too sure about this item but I had to take a risk.  I have hyperpigmentation scars on my leg.  I&#x27;ve had them on and off for a couple years.  It&#x27;s like a scaly, bumpy scar that rises above the surface.  I&#x27;ve had a lot of trouble removing this and It has been a challenge as well as embarassing. The first week I applied it, I felt like it burned a tiny bit but it was definitely tolerable.  It was so tolerable that I ended up leaving it for an entire day! WRONG! Don&#x27;t try this....my skin completely peeled and had to regenerate new skin in the process.  So, while it doesn&#x27;t feel or look like its working, it actually does, very slowly but surely.  It seems to even out skin as it peels away the darker areas surrounding it.  I havent achieved what I initally wanted to achieve which is, removal of the complete scar; that&#x27;s a huge challenge seeing as though I&#x27;ve had this hyperpigmentation for years.  So with that said, this is why I rated this item 3 out of 5.  It works slowly, but it&#x27;s not certain whether it will actually, completely do the trick, but it is definitely worth trying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, today is November 28th and I have been using this product on and off since the time I wrote the above review.  It has drastically reduced the pigmentation on my leg.  There is still a brownish hue left and my skin seems to continuously shed off dead skin and reveal new, healthy skin.  I have seem a lot of progress and I am surprised.  At some point, I didn&#x27;t think it could work so much.  Then, I decided to leave it for longer periods of time, eventually, my skin was tolerating it for the entire day without any reaction.  Next summer, I really think I will be able to show off my leg...without feeling shy by the pigmentation.  I was really self conscious of it, but now I feel so confident even walking around the house in shorts! I will definitely come back and update you some more.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Naturally it dries my skin out for a day or two after treatment but after those days.. (Not even bad drying) my skin glows. After I turned thirty being the sun worshipper/now sleep deprived mama of two.. It gives me the youthfulness that I desire. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Its perfect for once in a blue moon peeling, mostly in winter! NEVER EVER go in the sunlight after using this. I like the light peeling without roughing out skin.</li>
    <li> Works great! Except it really depends if you can tolerate the burning on your face. As long as you wash your face right after!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I didn&#x27;t have much irritation when I left it on for 2 minutes the first time I used it. My skin felt nice and tight immediately after I rinsed it off. I use it with a Hydroquinone cream and have seen the best results out of all the products I have tried for dark spots/melasma. It does burn but not to the point that it is unbearable and it&#x27;s worth it for the results I get. I had giving up hope on ever totally fading my dark spots but now I have confidence that this product will give me the results I have wanted for so many years. I have tried the Spa chemical peels, laser fading (several times), and numerous creams (prescribed and OTC) which none have given me the results that this \\&quot;little miracle in a bottle\\&quot; has given me. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to shrink pores, tighten skin, and/or fade dark spots. It works!!!</li>
    <li> II tried this product and it&#x27;s Ok. I need something a little different for my skin, so I gave this product to my daughter and she likes it. It gets the job done for her skin type</li>
    <li> This peel made me break out in painful pimples, causing even more hyper-pigmentation that I already had!  At first I followed the instructions, keeping it on for the minimum allotted time but no change occurred.  I then was able to leave it on for more time only to have no other effect take place.  The only difference is more pimples on my face. As soon as I stopped using the peel(within a few days) the pimples went away.</li>
    <li> I love this peel. I have used it 3 times so far and I have seen results already. I find this peel to burn and I cannot keep it on much longer than 2 minutes. I have been  doing peels for a couple of years now, salicylic and glycloic but the HQ seems to be better for my skin than both those other peels were. I do not actually ever &#x27;peel&#x27; but I am a bit red the next day.&lt;br /&gt;This peel is great for acne scars and acne prone skin. I have not had a break out since I started using it and I have noticed a lot of lightening on my stubborn acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;Add to all this Skin Laboratory does not test on animals :)</li>
    <li> This peel is strong and stings much like a TCA peel.  It works very well for me, but I can&#x27;t leave it on for more than 30 - 40 seconds (if that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it weekly for about a month and my skin is very luminous.  I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
</ol>
