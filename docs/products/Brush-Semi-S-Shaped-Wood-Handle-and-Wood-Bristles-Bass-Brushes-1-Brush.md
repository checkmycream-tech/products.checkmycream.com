      <li>Easy to clean.</li>
      <li>I have long curly hair, this would be best suited for naturally straight hair.</li>
      <li>I saw this Bass Brush on Amazon that has very good reviews and decided to try it.</li>

      <li>I was so excited about this brush.  </li>

      <li>I am of mixed ethnicity and I have battled my hair for many years.</li>
      <li>A girlfriend of mine who wears her beautiful African American hair natural recommended this brush to me, and I will never buy another brand brush ever again.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It went through my wet hair very easily, without breaking hair and untangled them.</li>
      <li>It is good for taking your scalp&#x27;s natural oil and pulling it down the length of your hair.  </li>
      <li>Somehow my locks are coarse and kinky yet fine and prone to split ends.</li>
      <li>I notice it really does help to not strip the oils out of my hair.</li>
      <li>I have searched my whole life for this brush.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s how much I like this brush and don&#x27;t want to be caught without it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A bit pricey for a brush. But, what a brush this is! Massages my head while styling it nicely as well.</li>
    <li> Beautiful brush, but you need a lot of hair to enjoy it.</li>
    <li> This is a good detangleing brush , but after a short period of time the cusion sunk in and I was not able to detangle . I have thick hair I would not buy this product again .</li>
    <li> The wood bristles feels a bit &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; even though it&#x27;s really not...just need to use it more to round them out more cuz I like to brush close to the scalp or when blow drying my hair I brush from the scalp.  I love this design &amp; concept.</li>
    <li> Love the feeling of this brush on my hair.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing for super tight thick curly hair.  My daughter screams when she gets her hair detanged.  Now she&#x27;ll sit and watch a movie.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality for an amazing price.  Beautifully crafted.</li>
    <li> I love this brush great for detangling especially when it is wet.</li>
    <li> I have three of these brushes. One in each of my homes and one that stays in my suitcase for trips.  That&#x27;s how much I like this brush and don&#x27;t want to be caught without it.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly suprised. The shape of the handle is good for griping. Brush bristles are not sharp and glide through my waist length hair completely. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I have it less than a week</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting to the point where I&#x27;m giving them as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Even as a southpaw this is comfortable in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;2. It doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;3. Most paddle brushes have a seam where the handle and brush are glued together. This is one solid piece, no seam to snag hair in.&lt;br /&gt;3. No bristles dipped in plastic. Well-sanded and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;4. The bristles are mounted solid, no little spots for hair to snag in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap brushes cause damage to your hair. Plastic will snag and actually cause breakage and cutting of the hair shaft. Saw cut and hand sanded combs and Bass wooden brushes are the best gift you can give your hair.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;Light but strong.  seems very durable.&lt;br /&gt;fits my left hand well.&lt;br /&gt;Goes through my older hair well.&lt;br /&gt;No pulling.&lt;br /&gt;It is a wonderful brush!</li>
    <li> This is a hard to find brush but the quality is superb. You won&#x27;t regret buying it. I am happy with mine and got another for my wife.</li>
    <li> MY wife loves these brushes and sayd the ywork great</li>
    <li> I love that this brush doesn&#x27;t have those little plastic heads on the ends of the bristles that break off all over the place. This is now my favorite brush!</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy a brush with wood bristles but wasn&#x27;t sure how it will feel and which is the best brush. I saw this Bass Brush on Amazon that has very good reviews and decided to try it. I got the semi S shaped one. It is quite big in size and looks very sturdy. One piece from head to handle. All the bristles  are very soft and looks embedded in the base very strongly. I started using it as soon as I got it. It feels so soft on my head, doesn&#x27;t feel like wood at all. It doesn&#x27;t tag or pull on my hair. I even tried it on my wet hair. I normally don&#x27;t brush wet hair, but wanted to see. It went through my wet hair very easily, without breaking hair and untangled them. My hair feel so soft after brushing and looks shiny too. I am glad I decided to give Bass brush a try. I now brush my hair more and that also a good thing and will help in growing my hair strong and healthy.</li>
    <li> Great brush to keep your hair looking great. This product arrived better than advertised. I love the way the handle fits my hand-- so comfortable!</li>
    <li> One of the brisels broken as soon as I got it and there is nothing difference between brushing your hair with a normal brush or a wooden brush</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this brush.  Not so much now, as it broke after only a few uses.  The rubber part and bristles popped off the wooden handle and even though I could pop that part back in, it never stayed, so the brush wasn&#x27;t usable.  Very sad about it considering it felt great on my scalp.  Maybe mine was just faulty, but either way, I had to throw it away.  Not happy.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased three wood combs and they are the best combs I have ever used.  I am a hair dresser and had never before used wood combs.  I will NEVER waste money on other types of combs again...and I do expect that these will outlive me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my wood bristle brush...amazing!  Well constructed and feels wonderful on your scalp.  I have gray, thinning hair and a fair amount of fallout so this brush is a God send.  As a result of using this brush, I have considerably less loss of hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this Bass brush!  I am about to purchase a smaller version of this brush for my hubby and another one for my purse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a few weeks now and am very happy with it.  It is very well made and sturdy and is comfortable to grip and use.</li>
    <li> Great all natural wood hair brush!&lt;br /&gt;Some plasic/cheap hair brushes can actually irritate skin,&lt;br /&gt;I bought this after I had discovered my cheapo plastic hair brush&lt;br /&gt;actually hair grease under the rubber cover of the handle (gross right?).&lt;br /&gt;I will only ever buy natural wood brushes again, I even got my girlfriend one!</li>
    <li> I originally liked this brush, but it didn&#x27;t last long. I had gotten it in 2014 and it lasted only two years, for the price 2 years isn&#x27;t enough. The bristles are mostly gone and its hard to clean. I have long curly hair, this would be best suited for naturally straight hair.</li>
    <li> I loved it, the perfect size, all wood, I recommend it, i algo give one to my sister. thats why i gave five stars.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves this brush! Works well on all hair types. Great for scalp.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing!! And amazons prompt delivery let me enjoy it sooner!!</li>
    <li> This is a great brush. It (the paddle) is a bit on the big side, I am fine with that even though my hair is thin. It would work well for someone with thick hair as the size would grab more hair. I have wash &amp; dried this brush and it is holding up just fine. Feels really good in hand &amp; on head. No hesitation on recommending this brush.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and this brush reaches my scalp. I recently started practicing a new method &amp;#34;Water only hair wash&amp;#34;. I want to stimulate my scalp better and it feels wonderful on my scalp. It doesn&#x27;t pull out my hair or cause static. I purchased an Olivia Garden wooden bristle brush and it pulled some of my hair out. I noticed the OG brush also caused static. I make sure to section/ detangle and use my Bass on slightly damp hair. This really is a nice brush so don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase it. To my natural ladies/all lovely chicas if you decide to practice the WOHW this brush is an excellent choice. To learn about the method more lookup Wateronlywash on YT. She is a joy to watch and is an extremely helpful/ encouraging person.</li>
    <li> The bristles reach my scalp - other brushes don&#x27;t go as deep</li>
    <li> Love this.  Very smooth bristles, do not tangle or drag in my natural type 4 hair. Handle style really surprising.... it fit perfectly as I was blowing my hair dry!  I purchased 2.  Very impressed.  For me this is more beautiful and much better performer than the Denman brush.</li>
    <li> Works really well.  Told a friend about it right away. I have long hair &amp; it went through it well.</li>
    <li> Great at massaging the scalp and working out tangles without damaging hair. Very attractive wood design. And is much easier on my thick wavy hair then a plastic brush. Seems to be better quality then a plastic brush also. I have become a believer in the wooden hair brush, and will never go back.</li>
    <li> Favorite brush of all time!!!!!!!! Love this brush. I will never go back to anything else. Can brush my hair when its wet to and no problem at all. And Ihave very course hair and it amazing.</li>
    <li> I have a boar bristle brush that I really love, but it always disappears so I bought this as a back up.  It works really well for thick, wavy hair.  It is good for taking your scalp&#x27;s natural oil and pulling it down the length of your hair.  It makes my hair soft and smooth but not flat and staticky like BBB&#x27;s can.  It feels great on your scalp too.  Also very easy to clean since the bristles are farther apart than a BBB.  If you&#x27;re no poo or low poo and a vegan this is a great option.  I&#x27;m not a vegan and I still really like it!  Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> I really love this brush and I think there is less breakage in my hair since I started using this brush. It&lt;br /&gt;also hurts less to get the tangles out than when I use a plastic comb. It feels great on the scalp.</li>
    <li> Its my 2nd bass brush, I used my first one for long time.. Its still working and looks like new but too small, so I got this one because its larger, also price is good. I dont like plastic or metal brush and wood brush is perfect for my long hair.</li>
    <li> Love the brush. Love the bristles. Easy to clean. Feels great on the scalp. Works great for thick hair, much better than the boar bristle brushes which struggle to reach my scalp.</li>
    <li> Great Brush. I notice it really does help to not strip the oils out of my hair. I have thick hair and it goes everywhere if it dries out. THis brush helps with that and massages my scalp at the same time.</li>
    <li> I have very long, fine hair that tangles easily. Since switching to this brush I no longer have to worry about my hair breaking while brushing, even when wet. And the wooden bristles feel amazing on my scalp!</li>
    <li> My favorite brush!!! I get tiny tangles and this gets them out without damaging my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks better than when I was using boar.&lt;br /&gt;This is wooden bristles. Great for stimulating the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I have the travel size for my purse &amp; use this one at home.&lt;br /&gt;Love the S shape! I do not like paddle brushes. They are big and clunky. This one is perfect for my long hair. Works great with blow drying too.</li>
    <li> Feels great. Much better than any comb I&#x27;ve ever tried before. My hair gets tangled, this combs through like a breeze. Feels like a little massage too. It&#x27;s also green! Bonus</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the beautiful wood and authenticity of the brush. It works well, massages my scalp. However, after the first brushing one pin came out and I was afraid what that might mean, but since then its been quite durable.</li>
    <li> Wow!!! At the risk of engaging in hyperbole, I cannot believe how amazing this hairbrush is!!! This is truly the greatest hairbrush I have ever used in my 50 years of life. The bamboo bristles are very smooth and well spaced, making it easy to brush through my long curls. It feels like a relaxing massage on my scalp. I will literally never use another hairbrush. If you are a curly girl do yourself a favor and get this brush! I imagine it would be fantastic on straight hair as well.</li>
    <li> I have searched my whole life for this brush. I am of mixed ethnicity and I have battled my hair for many years. Somehow my locks are coarse and kinky yet fine and prone to split ends. Ugh. A girlfriend of mine who wears her beautiful African American hair natural recommended this brush to me, and I will never buy another brand brush ever again.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is more manageable, no tangles for the first time! I don&#x27;t even flat iron my hair anymore, its so soft and silky I haven&#x27;t needed to.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this high quality brush to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very nice brush. 100% bamboo. Because of the bamboo, less static is produced on my super-static-prone hair. I feel good using more natural products on my hair. The hard, cone-like bristles do not get caught in my hair. Love this brush.</li>
