<ol>
    <li> Styies and helps hot flashes</li>
    <li> I cannot get it to shape to my head. Just looks too clumsy.</li>
    <li> I love it. I like the fabric. I think i paid a good price for it and it looks like the pic. I used it as &amp;#34;head cover&amp;#34; at church for the worship and it is wide enought to work as head covering. Just in case you are christian and looking for something like that.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, and for a great price! But I didn&#x27;t like that it was only in the package sent. Looks new but no tags or plastic to show if its new.</li>
    <li> Does what I bought it for.  Arrived ahead of date promised.  Fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable! And it looks really nice.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh.&lt;br /&gt;I just bought an 18 dollar bandana in grey off Etsy.&lt;br /&gt;wore yesterday. These fit so much better: look so much better: and are 3.99 plus free shipping? I just now ordered all for myself: 12 more.&lt;br /&gt;and think I already have 7.&lt;br /&gt;these are incredible.&lt;br /&gt;pretty and well made.</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Too small. Keeps sliding off.</li>
    <li> Merchandise is great all of it is what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Super comfortable and looks great!</li>
    <li> ordering more right now. just needed an easy soft headband, this is perfect.</li>

    <li> It was for a Gift, no tag as on the item, so it could have been used for all we knew. very long ship time!</li>
    <li> the material is too thin and it shows the scalp underneath. it is comfortable and it fits well.</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would stay a little poufy on top but its wearable and I like the lace</li>
    <li> When you want to leave your hair down or just don&#x27;t feel like doing it this is a very pretty hair band for that purpose.</li>
    <li> This is great.  Love it and will order other colors if I can find them.</li>
    <li> LOVED IT.  ITEM JUST AS DESCRIBED. GREAT PRICE, WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> I love these! I have approximately 14 of them in various colors.  They are cute, fit well, and can be worn a few different ways.  Super fast shipping and nicely packaged!</li>
    <li> I really have no feeling about it but I will say if I saw it in a store I would not have purchased.</li>
    <li> This headband, when stretched completely offers full coverage, which is exactly what I was looking for!  It&#x27;s not tight at all, and feels more like cotton than acrylic.  I can wear this to church or to my son&#x27;s sport events... very cute!</li>
    <li> Love the fit and wear it often.</li>
    <li> Looks great with gray hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Nothing special about it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for the price and it&#x27;s just as pictured</li>
    <li> Get compliments on it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Takes a while to get because they ship from China</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Very nice, great quality. Deleted one star because it runs small. However, I&#x27;ll be using it while performing skincare routine, not for long-time wear. One star due to delivery time. I guess I didn&#x27;t think it really would take three weeks (plus a day), but it shipped directly from Malaysia.</li>
    <li> Good buy. Took awhile for deliver</li>
