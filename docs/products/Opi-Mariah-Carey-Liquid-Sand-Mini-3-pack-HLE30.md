      <li>But still loved the colors on this pack</li>
      <li>GOOD</li>
      <li>I saw swatches that made it seem really attractive but my experience was that it comes across as more of a gray with glitter.  </li>
      <li>I love glitter!</li>
      <li>Its great for my 4yo because it doesn&#x27;t flake off easily.</li>
      <li>The glitter is just amazing</li>
      <li>Perfect all-around polish.&lt;br /&gt;Baby</li>
      <li>I liked the matte look.</li>
      <li>This is a good way to get these colors without paying an arm and a leg for a full sized bottle.</li>
      <li>It was magical.</li>
      <li>But I did not use a top coat bc</li>
      <li>Which the bronze is more like a coral color which I absolutely love.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I ran out of my favorite color that is in this package.</li>
      <li>Love this &amp;#34;sand like&amp;#34; texture-</li>
      <li>Love this polish and the colors.</li>

      <li>What a great way to get to try new</li>
      <li>These mini bottles are great and allows you to try the color without paying the higher price for a full size bottle that may gum up if you don&#x27;t use it all the time.</li>
      <li>Love the neutral glitter colors and the effect, So pretty!!</li>
      <li>They hide ridges in nail surface, are very forgiving of imperfect application, great for a quick mani.  </li>
      <li>Waited forever on shipping, but it was worth it!</li>
      <li>These colors are fantastic neutrals while having the fun sand and glitter texture.</li>
      <li>The seller also shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>The little bottles were great bc</li>
      <li>Especially the exfoliating kind, it really helps.</li>
      <li>Thanks OPI!</li>
      <li>but it looks really pretty also.</li>
      <li>, I REALLY wanted to like this polish.  </li>
      <li>I just took the gold off and it went much quicker then with a cotton ball/tissue.</li>
      <li>it sparkles so much.</li>
      <li>We both love the liquid sand line and invested in large bottles in other colors now.</li>
      <li>I love OPI nail polish and have used other Liquid Sand polishes before.</li>
      <li>I got this set because so many of this collection looked like possible gotta-haves that I wanted to try them in smaller sizes first.&lt;br /&gt;Silent</li>
      <li>I love OPI products, the only one thing that I have noticed lately special with the liquid sand is that they don´t last as long as they use to too and chip.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I like the mini sets because I rarely go though an entire bottle of nail polish (I&#x27;m an addict).</li>
      <li>Colors are classy and sassy, match with any mood/season/outfit.</li>
      <li>Texture is a bit weird but it looks terrific and lasts a long time - easy to take off as well unlike most glitter polishes</li>

<li> Texture is a bit weird but it looks terrific and lasts a long time - easy to take off as well unlike most glitter polishes</li>
<li> It is alittle thick at first.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m constantly typing on a keyboard and doing other things that involve using my hands (like washing dishes).</li>
<li> it lasts for a very long time without chipping (4-7 days)</li>
<li> My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t find this same pink colored one in a larger version!</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t like the brush, makes application too difficult as it cakes up quickly.</li>
<li> It is the only nail polish that has lasted on my nails for longer than a few days.</li>
<li> Go By, but just too pink to be a flexible as SSGB.</li>
<li> Too pink for me.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s the only one that will stay on my nails without chipping for at least three days.</li>
<li> I was a little sad that they only sell these in packages and don&#x27;t sell them in the big bottles anymore unless you buy then for $30.00</li>
<li> you can try a little of everything!</li>
<li> Cheaper than Shellac colors, holds just as well if not better when applied with shellac kit.</li>
<li> but it is small.</li>
<li> This polish goes on thick and textured.</li>
<li> Very hard colors to find.</li>
<li> Like all glitter nail polish it is terrible to take off, but use one of those face wipes, and it helps so much.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Opi Polish.  </li>
<li> so I was a bit disappointed when they arrived.</li>

    <li> Great product and seller! The polish colors are beautiful and neutral. Very hard colors to find. This is a good way to get these colors without paying an arm and a leg for a full sized bottle.</li>
    <li> I love OPI nail polish and have used other Liquid Sand polishes before. Haven&#x27;t tried these yet but I assume they will be of comparable quality. I misread the item description and thought these were full-sized bottles so I was a bit disappointed when they arrived. It was 100% my fault though so I did not complain to seller.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the brush, makes application too difficult as it cakes up quickly. This is not the OPI brush that you get in the regular size bottles.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this nail polish. It&#x27;s the only one that will stay on my nails without chipping for at least three days. Not only that, but it looks really pretty also. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> bought for a friends and she loves them</li>
    <li> I love OPI products, the only one thing that I have noticed lately special with the liquid sand is that they don´t last as long as they use to too and chip. But still loved the colors on this pack</li>
    <li> Love texture polishes.  They hide ridges in nail surface, are very forgiving of imperfect application, great for a quick mani.  I got this set because so many of this collection looked like possible gotta-haves that I wanted to try them in smaller sizes first.&lt;br /&gt;Silent Stars Go By:  LOVE IT.  Would wear it every day.  Almost qualifies as a &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34;  You could wear it in office, or to a glitzy party.  Perfect all-around polish.&lt;br /&gt;Baby Please Come Home:  as a lover of all things purple, I REALLY wanted to like this polish.  I saw swatches that made it seem really attractive but my experience was that it comes across as more of a gray with glitter.  Sort of drab &amp; dreary.&lt;br /&gt;Make Him Mine:  meh.  Too pink for me.  Very similar to Silent Starts Go By, but just too pink to be a flexible as SSGB.</li>
    <li> Love this &amp;#34;sand like&amp;#34; texture- it lasts for a very long time without chipping (4-7 days) and I&#x27;m constantly typing on a keyboard and doing other things that involve using my hands (like washing dishes). My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t find this same pink colored one in a larger version!</li>
    <li> GOOD but it is small.</li>
    <li> Awesome colors! Texture is a bit weird but it looks terrific and lasts a long time - easy to take off as well unlike most glitter polishes</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful polish and I love the colors in this set.  It stays on well and has great color.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with Opi Polish.  They have a muppet set out too that is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I love glitter! I don&#x27;t know why these were on sale and more people didn&#x27;t buy them. The colors are great! You get gold, silver, and bronze glitter. Which the bronze is more like a coral color which I absolutely love. The glitter is just amazing it sparkles so much. Like all glitter nail polish it is terrible to take off, but use one of those face wipes, and it helps so much. Especially the exfoliating kind, it really helps. I just took the gold off and it went much quicker then with a cotton ball/tissue.</li>
    <li> I really love this set. What a great way to get to try new colors- now I just wish they were bigger.</li>
    <li> This polish goes on thick and textured. Its great for my 4yo because it doesn&#x27;t flake off easily. We both love the liquid sand line and invested in large bottles in other colors now.</li>
    <li> These mini bottles are great and allows you to try the color without paying the higher price for a full size bottle that may gum up if you don&#x27;t use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Love this polish and the colors.</li>
    <li> I like the mini sets because I rarely go though an entire bottle of nail polish (I&#x27;m an addict). These colors are fantastic neutrals while having the fun sand and glitter texture. My only complaint is that OPI doesn&#x27;t label their mini polishes - not a huge deal for most but it does bother me. The seller also shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I ran out of my favorite color that is in this package. I was a little sad that they only sell these in packages and don&#x27;t sell them in the big bottles anymore unless you buy then for $30.00</li>
    <li> Love the neutral glitter colors and the effect, So pretty!! Only left off a star because it chipped the next day. But I did not use a top coat bc I liked the matte look. The little bottles were great bc you can try a little of everything!</li>
    <li> It is the only nail polish that has lasted on my nails for longer than a few days. It is alittle thick at first. I love the colors.</li>
    <li> I bought these and when I opened the package, Mariah herself appeared to paint my nails while singing her greatest hits in a hula girl grass skirt. It was magical. Thanks OPI!</li>
    <li> super sparkly - there is no substitute for glitter !!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Cheaper than Shellac colors, holds just as well if not better when applied with shellac kit. Colors are classy and sassy, match with any mood/season/outfit. Waited forever on shipping, but it was worth it!</li>
