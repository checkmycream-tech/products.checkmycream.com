### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Stick to Spin Pins which are the best things ever!</li>
      <li>And it worked beautifully.</li>
      <li>LOL  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fairly experienced with putting my waist length hair up in a bun.</li>
      <li>What I would like to know is HOW they got the nice bun that is pictured on the box using this tool?!</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re welcome to make your own decision about it.creative for it to work.</li>
      <li>wouldn&#x27;t that look good.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;re welcome to make your own decision about it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I can use it but not as great as I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>I love mine!</li>
      <li>Those are awesome and SO much easier to work with.</li>
      <li>What kind of hair was this made for?</li>
      <li>Most of the time I can&#x27;t get the spiral to catch the hair under my braided bun.</li>
      <li>it provides a nice secure bun that stays put, even if the ends of my layers stick out.</li>
      <li>I might could do the top part of my hair in a bun -</li>
      <li>I noticed that the tutorial on youtube shows the model with the bun on top of her head, probably to defy gravity.  </li>
      <li>If there was a couple more coils on it this could work out.</li>
      <li>I had to get creative for it to work.</li>
      <li>Make sure the ends dig into the hair that&#x27;s tied before the pony tail and isn&#x27;t in the bun, or this won&#x27;t stay.</li>
      <li>I love the spin pins, so I tried this based on my love for them.</li>
      <li>I could not get this to stay in my hair at all, I tried around my bun, twisting it from the end didn&#x27;t work either, it just wouldn&#x27;t stay for more than a minute.</li>
      <li>I have bought several items that are supposed to make the perfect bun</li>
      <li>However if it doesn&#x27;t catch the hair on the top or sides of the bun</li>
      <li>It would be awesome if they made a smaller version-</li>
      <li>Hold is pretty good, but I still prefer the spin pins.  </li>
      <li>What a surprise right!!</li>
      <li>no, this is not all that easy to use.</li>
      <li>Average at best.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s so fine and &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It, fortunately, doesn&#x27;t pull or break the hair.</li>
      <li>I love the spin pins and was pretty excited to see this product</li>
      <li>If Goody made another version about 1 1/2 to twice the diameter of the original, I think I&#x27;d be all set.</li>
      <li>it wasn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
      <li>is the best word I can come up with at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this for light colored hair after I was told that my hair was simply too long for work and pony</li>
      <li>personally can&#x27;t say if this is worth it or not, all I can do is detail my own experiences with it.</li>
      <li>personally can&#x27;t say if this is worth it or not, all I can do is detail my own experiences with it.</li>
      <li>sometimes I didn&#x27;t tuck in the end right</li>
      <li>but that does not matter - simply set it on the top of the bun, start twisting and end up with a great messy bun that will stay all day.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t imagine this working unless you had very fine short hair, in which case I don&#x27;t know why you would even need this product...</li>
      <li>I had an interesting looking knot on the back of my head that caught attention and had others asking how I did it.</li>
      <li>I got the idea to braid my hair first then wrap it up into a bun shape before I screwed the bun spiral in.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not terrible but it obviously doesn&#x27;t work how it was intended.</li>
      <li>I shouldn&#x27;t have had to apply a braid to my hair for it to catch and hold as that was never put into the directions in the first</li>
      <li>I shouldn&#x27;t have had to apply a braid to my hair for it to catch and hold as that was never put into the directions in the first</li>
      <li>first three days I couldn&#x27;t get it to work at all.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not terrible but it obviously doesn&#x27;t work how it was intended.</li>
      <li>Goody&#x27;s Spin Pins are a much easier to use, more versatile product and you can get the same results.</li>
      <li>I can make a bun with some of my hair, and it&#x27;s really very stable, and pretty neat looking, too, but not all of it at once.  </li>
      <li>The only way I got this to keep the bun in is to make a ponytail on the top of my head (even though the directions tell you to make a low ponytail) and secure the ponytail with a ponytail holder.</li>
      <li>My hair is of medium thickness and about 6 inches past shoulder length and this works fairly well in it.</li>
      <li>Also if I put the spiral in at an angle it wouldn&#x27;t reach my scalp in certain locations.</li>
      <li>First off my hair is long and fine.</li>
      <li>I was ready to give up on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was really torn on the star rating of this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very hit or miss if it will hold in my hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I was really torn on the star rating of this.</li>
      <li>Did not work for my long, fine hair.</li>
      <li>It can make some pretty interesting messy buns that hold well, I found the youtube videos helpful.    </li>
      <li>, you have to start by twisting the red ends in at the top and twisting them through the entire bun.</li>
      <li>Overall I would recommend the spin pins over this product, but if you have medium hair, average thickness, I think you could make some nice updos with this bun spiral.</li>
      <li>You have to do a really high bun for it to actually work, but that&#x27;s exactly what I bought it for.  </li>
      <li>The ONLY reason I ordered online is due to the fact that walmart had over 10 in stock that were removed from shelves and magically disappeared overnight.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t easily make a messy bun without being visible.</li>
      <li>The bun seems to have more staying power and is less likely to slip out if you start with damp hair.</li>
      <li>A clip that big really would look like I&#x27;d been attacked by an octopus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A clip that big really would look like I&#x27;d been attacked by an octopus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That was a complete disaster.</li>
      <li>It is way too small to fit over a bun.  </li>
      <li>Worth the little I pain, but this is, thus far, probably my least favorite of the Goody Simple Styles gadgets.  </li>
      <li>This thing is so clever, but I just wish they made it in different sizes for different types of hair.  </li>
      <li>It stayed in good for the hair that could be locked in, for me anyway, but it couldn&#x27;t contain all my hair which is down to my waist and very thick.  </li>
      <li>So I twisted it up into a nice neat chignon, then spiraled this into place.</li>
      <li>I have ridiculously thick hair (about shoulder length), and it just won&#x27;t all fit inside the coil.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little challenging to get it fully hidden (and I have quite a lot of hair).  </li>
      <li>My hair is too fine and not long enough to create a big enough bun to nest tightly in the ring.  </li>
      <li>the whole thing flops around and falls either to one side or rolls down my neck.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have long, to my waist, fairly thick hair.  I love the spin pins and was pretty excited to see this product so I bought it without any research.  It&#x27;s very hit or miss if it will hold in my hair.  Some days, the bun stays in place with no problems, other days I find myself redoing the bun again and again.  It can make some pretty interesting messy buns that hold well, I found the youtube videos helpful.    Overall I would recommend the spin pins over this product, but if you have medium hair, average thickness, I think you could make some nice updos with this bun spiral.</li>
    <li> I played with it for 2 hours trying to get it to stay in...ponytail holder, no ponytail holder, tight twisted bun, loosely twisted bun...It will not stay in. I have medium length hair and medium thickness and my hair will not fit through the bun spiral. Also the spiral is too short. I can&#x27;t get it to reach my scalp. If there was a couple more coils on it this could work out. The only way I got this to keep the bun in is to make a ponytail on the top of my head (even though the directions tell you to make a low ponytail) and secure the ponytail with a ponytail holder. Then twist my hair into a bun and twist the spiral in, but even then the ends still stick out...What I would like to know is HOW they got the nice bun that is pictured on the box using this tool?! I don&#x27;t recommend this product. Although, I would recommend the spin pins. Those are awesome and SO much easier to work with.</li>
    <li> Save yourselves time,money and frustration.the goody bun spiral is practically useless and falls out seconds after you use it.  I can&#x27;t believe how anyone can use one of these and keep it in.  DO  NOT  BUY   ONE!!</li>
    <li> I found this bun spiral pretty worthless for my sleek, medium thickness hair.  It would fall out no matter how I twisted it in.  I tried with and without a ponytail holder, tight bun, messy bun, and even a teased bun.  I noticed that the tutorial on youtube shows the model with the bun on top of her head, probably to defy gravity.  That may work, as long as she doesn&#x27;t look down.</li>
    <li> If you have medium, long and/or thick hair do not waste your time with this product.  It is way too small to fit over a bun.  I can&#x27;t imagine this working unless you had very fine short hair, in which case I don&#x27;t know why you would even need this product...</li>
    <li> I am surprised to read all the negative reviews on this product. I love mine! I have very thick hair and the spiral does not fit over a bun but that does not matter - simply set it on the top of the bun, start twisting and end up with a great messy bun that will stay all day. One thing I have found that helps is to start with wet hair (towel-dried). The bun seems to have more staying power and is less likely to slip out if you start with damp hair.</li>
    <li> Well I bought it, and I&#x27;m returning it.  Contrary to the spin pins, this bun spiral didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  My hair is too fine and not long enough to create a big enough bun to nest tightly in the ring.  My hair is blond and just beyond shoulder length, with layers, and the bun I created was too small to be hugged by the spiral bun ring.  I think it would work if I longer and thicker hair.  It would be awesome if they made a smaller version- I&#x27;d give that a try.</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair I could not get this to stay in my hair at all, I tried around my bun, twisting it from the end didn&#x27;t work either, it just wouldn&#x27;t stay for more than a minute.</li>
    <li> This did NOT work with my thick hair.  And it did not fit in my mother&#x27;s thin hair.  I do not recommend this product</li>

    <li> First off my hair is long and fine. It comes down to just above the seat of my pants. I have a lot of it but it&#x27;s so fine and &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; is the best word I can come up with at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this for light colored hair after I was told that my hair was simply too long for work and pony tailing it wasn&#x27;t good enough. Well I didn&#x27;t want to cut it and I had never had any luck with buns so I tried this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first three days I couldn&#x27;t get it to work at all. I spent nearly thirty minutes each morning trying to get my long, fine hair to stay in the blasted thing. It kept slipping out through the middle in a noose like loop. I tried with a ponytail holder and without to no avail. I had others try to roll my hair into a tight bun (one person was brutal with how tight she pulled) and it still fell out the center or my ends would fan out like a halo around the base of it. I was ready to give up on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got the idea to braid my hair first then wrap it up into a bun shape before I screwed the bun spiral in. And it worked beautifully. I had an interesting looking knot on the back of my head that caught attention and had others asking how I did it. The down side to that was sometimes I didn&#x27;t tuck in the end right and it would pop out and try to unravel. Also if I put the spiral in at an angle it wouldn&#x27;t reach my scalp in certain locations. Most of the time I can&#x27;t get the spiral to catch the hair under my braided bun. On those days the bun will stay in place, it just bounces a bit. However if it doesn&#x27;t catch the hair on the top or sides of the bun the whole thing flops around and falls either to one side or rolls down my neck. Oh yes, and if you make it work even at an angle there is always the chance one of the rounded ends will try to dig into your scalp all day. Sometimes I don&#x27;t realize that until I&#x27;m a few hours into work and it really begins to smart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So no, this is not all that easy to use. I had to get creative for it to work. It didn&#x27;t work how it was intended so that&#x27;s really a sour note. In the end I made it work but it&#x27;s not perfect. I have my days where I just can&#x27;t get the damned thing to cooperate with me and I give up. This is all I could find though that kept my very long hair tamed without adding a monster sized octopus clip to the back of my head. A clip that big really would look like I&#x27;d been attacked by an octopus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really torn on the star rating of this. It&#x27;s not terrible but it obviously doesn&#x27;t work how it was intended. I shouldn&#x27;t have had to apply a braid to my hair for it to catch and hold as that was never put into the directions in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally can&#x27;t say if this is worth it or not, all I can do is detail my own experiences with it.

    <li> Worth the little I pain, but this is, thus far, probably my least favorite of the Goody Simple Styles gadgets.  It&#x27;s a little challenging to get it fully hidden (and I have quite a lot of hair).  Hold is pretty good, but I still prefer the spin pins.  It, fortunately, doesn&#x27;t pull or break the hair.</li>
    <li> So not worth it.  The bun was unstable and fell out every time.  Luckily, I only paid $5.99 at CVS.  Still, a waste of $6.</li>
    <li> This never fits my bun.  I have long thick hair and it does NOT WORK! Don&#x27;t waste your money.    It might work for someone with thin and shoulder length hair, but not if your hair is sleek and thick.    LAME!</li>
    <li> My hair is of medium thickness and about 6 inches past shoulder length and this works fairly well in it. It always tend to be a messy bun, but this is because Of my layers and even with bobby pins I can&#x27;t stick those ends down.   It did take me a few tries to get this to stay in, but once I got the knack it provides a nice secure bun that stays put, even if the ends of my layers stick out. You can&#x27;t just put this on over the bun so it&#x27;s against your head and then twist, you have to start by twisting the red ends in at the top and twisting them through the entire bun. Make sure the ends dig into the hair that&#x27;s tied before the pony tail and isn&#x27;t in the bun, or this won&#x27;t stay.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Target when I had long hair (5 inches below my shoulders).  I have medium thickness asian hair and could not figure out how to get it to stay.  The small 2 pins (same brand/concept) worked for me.</li>
    <li> Stick to Spin Pins which are the best things ever! This never works for me, I have thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t grip or hold at all.</li>
    <li> A hair tie is definitely necessary when I use this and I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the way it feels against my head, but it does work if used properly.</li>
    <li> Did not work for my long, fine hair. Goody&#x27;s Spin Pins are a much easier to use, more versatile product and you can get the same results.</li>
    <li> If my hair weren&#x27;t so thick, I believe it would have worked.  It stayed in good for the hair that could be locked in, for me anyway, but it couldn&#x27;t contain all my hair which is down to my waist and very thick.  I might could do the top part of my hair in a bun - wouldn&#x27;t that look good.  LOL  I&#x27;ve never found one of these bun makers which would contain long thick hair but still looking.</li>
    <li> I love the spin pins, so I tried this based on my love for them. I&#x27;m fairly experienced with putting my waist length hair up in a bun. So I twisted it up into a nice neat chignon, then spiraled this into place. It held for about 10 minutes, then started slipping out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I thought \\&quot;Maybe my hair is too straight\\&quot; and tried it in my daughter&#x27;s curls. That was a complete disaster. It seemed like it was holding her hair, but it turned out it did slip, and tangled in her hair. Removing it took a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice concept, but poorly executed. It&#x27;s too small for very thick or very long hair, too big for thin hair or hair that is too short. In the end, it was simply unusable. Stick to spin pins, 2 of the regular sized ones will hold my hair in a bun all day long.</li>
    <li> You have to do a really high bun for it to actually work, but that&#x27;s exactly what I bought it for.  If you&#x27;re looking to wear a bun similar to what is pictured on the box though, don&#x27;t bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH! And you WILL go off if you wear it through a metal detector!</li>
    <li> I cant wait to get mine! I have very thick heavy hair so I hope it will stay in place. My only issue is that the item RETAIL @ Walmart is $5.99 NOT $19.99 so you ARE NOT SAVING 14.99 and even with my prime account I had to pay 4.59 shipping on an item costing 1.46 my total 5.99 my savings 0. This would also lead me to believe the 3pk @ 33.00 is massively overpriced considering 3x5&#x3D;15! I thought amazon was for saving money not just convenience! The ONLY reason I ordered online is due to the fact that walmart had over 10 in stock that were removed from shelves and magically disappeared overnight. I went back the next morning to buy one and they cannot find them! What a surprise right!! Now all the reviews say not to buy, Ima be pissed if this item sucks!!!</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair and wear it a bun all the time.  I have bought several items that are supposed to make the perfect bun and I have yet to find one that works-this product is no different.  What kind of hair was this made for? I threw it away.</li>
