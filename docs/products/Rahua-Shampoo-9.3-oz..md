      <li>I use the conditioner as well and just love it.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why so many shampoos and care products have so many chemicals in them</li>
      <li>I sure hope this review helps you in your decision.</li>
      <li>I love the product.</li>
      <li>Anyways it was the longest lasting, best smelling shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I would love to continue using it</li>
      <li>--I get better results.</li>
      <li>It has an interesting smell that I like but others may not.  </li>
      <li>$32 a bottle, I&#x27;m rather peeved and won&#x27;t be risking ordering any more Rahua.</li>
      <li>My hair feels and looks better than ever, and my scalp couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Love it&lt;br /&gt;Camdace</li>
      <li>The price was great and shipping was fast.  </li>
      <li>But I have finally found the perfect combination.</li>
      <li>It smelled amazing at first, I loved smelling it in my hair and knowing my hair was clean but after a month or two you get used to the smell</li>
      <li>I am a 50 year old woman and I am extremely happy with the results.</li>
      <li>I use to have beautiful, luxurious and healthy hair, and I wanted it back.</li>
      <li>I have been a happy Biolage shampoo and conditioner user for years but wanted to switch to natural hair products without chemical additives.</li>
      <li>but it does really leave your hair in a good</li>
      <li>I have extremely fine hair and Rahua</li>
      <li>I am a HUGE review reader and did a ton of research.</li>
      <li>I think the product is great, but the servise of shipping the product to my house was not stable; the product was totally falling out.</li>
      <li>Not the cheap fuzzy stuffed animal looking hair</li>
      <li>Will definately purchase from this seller again if the Rahua conditioner and shampoo are available.</li>
      <li>It receives the most compliments right after shampooing and benefits from volumizing products (my weapon of choice: Sachajuan beach mist).</li>
      <li>For a sulfate-free shampoo it produces a decent amount of lather and smells nice.</li>
      <li>Honestly, all I can say is WOW!!</li>
      <li>and my hair did not feel clean.  </li>
      <li>As a vegan, knowing that it&#x27;s animal testing free and has quality organic ingredients is worth the price tag.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep looking for a more reasonably priced shampoo and conditioner without chemicals because these are WAY overpriced.</li>
      <li>I really, really wanted to love Rahua.</li>
      <li>perfect for my thin, fine hair  not harsh, but super effective...</li>
      <li>I love that this is a natural shampoo and that it is sulfate and paraben free...</li>
      <li>works great as a sensitive scalp shampoo and on sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>They are great products and when you think of all the money you spend on the other stuff that doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>I use a quarters worth on my scalp once a week.</li>
      <li>It was worth a try, but I probably won&#x27;t be repurchasing again.</li>
      <li>But if you get it thru Rahua, it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>By the way, the shampoo does not have extreme lather, which is good.</li>
      <li>The ladies there told me to get the regular kind rather than the voluminous as the regular is more moisturizing.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;ve been flake free for up to 6 days after 2 uses (2 weeks worth).</li>
      <li>/&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clean so violently as normal (SLS) shampoo</li>
      <li>You do not need much too which is economical.</li>
      <li>the two most recent were Loreal expert serums).</li>
      <li>the only con was my dandruff which is the thing I needed help with the most.</li>
      <li>I have tried COUNTLESS serums as well (too many to name but</li>
      <li>Rahua did the first month:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>hot curler sets.</li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a very good shampoo, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the lavish price tag.</li>
      <li>I have since switched to good old drugstore shampoo, and my hair is back to normal again.</li>
      <li>this is a great shampoo for dandruff, it worked amazingly for my dandruff the first time but after that my dandruff got horribly worse to the point where you can see the dry skin peeling off my scalp and dandruff everywhere.</li>
      <li>I have to wash daily and this shampoo is even more gentle than the baby shampoo I was using before.</li>
      <li>I use a Hot Tools (large barrel) spring curling iron (purple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use nothing but natural, organic products but this stuff is just nothing special.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a 10 leave in conditioner and Loreal Smooth Intense Xtreme Straight Creme in my damp hair, I use the Olivia Garden 2 3/4 round brush, I use the DryBar Lemondrop Blow dryer (LOVE), I still use my Hot Tools large barrel purple spring curling iron.</li>
      <li>This conditioner smells OK (not really much scent at all, kind of an oily smell), and I like the fact that it&#x27;s natural but don&#x27;t expect any improvement in your hair over a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; commercial conditioner and</li>
      <li>Small quantity that smells great and leaves your hair soft and &amp;#34;comb-able.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>And I drink a glass of pure Acai juice every night with a Biotin tablet.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why people say it doesn&#x27;t lather much.</li>
      <li>As for it working wonders, I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
      <li>Since I used it so infrequently, it lasted a whole year (if that somehow helps justify the price).</li>
      <li>really didn&#x27;t like this shampoo.</li>
      <li>gives my hair so much body and fullness...</li>
      <li>I really hope I can find the correct shampoo for that.</li>
      <li>It smelled rancid and not at all like the real thing, so I returned it.</li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing, I will admit to that.</li>
      <li>Hair feels so much healthier after using this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is now my favorite shampoo! I just wish I could buy a larger bottle. I have very fine oily hair I have to wash daily and this shampoo is even more gentle than the baby shampoo I was using before. It is expensive but I finally have nice looking hair!</li>
    <li> Since my hairstylist friend began educating me on all-natural, chemical-free products, I&#x27;ve been searching for one that I like.  I&#x27;ve tried several from various web sites and must say, I really liked this shampoo.  It took me half a bottle before I noticed a difference though.  I would have given it five stars, but $30+ for this little bottle is ridiculously high.</li>
    <li> The shampoo, conditioner and leave in styling aid are CRAZY expensive - and it WORKS! I have color treated, thick semi curly hair and these products tame the frizz and leave my hair looking fabulous. I do add a little Aveda styling crème as a final step to my damp hair - mostly because I like the definition and smell it gives to my hair. I sure hope this review helps you in your decision. They are great products and when you think of all the money you spend on the other stuff that doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I just read the reviews below and I couldn&#x27;t help myself thinking how ignorant americans are when it comes to environmental issues. I think this shampoo works wonders, however whether you like it or not, in this day and age 100% petrochemical-free natural/organic shampoos are made of highly expensive natural ingredients. Those toxic petrochemical molecules are up to 2000 times cheaper than natural substances. In 2011 an all natural organic shampoo at the price of a regular conventional drugstore shampoo is total nonsense!</li>
    <li> I wanted a shampoo that was made with natural ingredients, no sulfites or paraben (linked to cancer) and other harmful ingredients.  I was delighted to find this one.  I don&#x27;t know why so many shampoos and care products have so many chemicals in them, it just isn&#x27;t good, for the body or environment.  So I decided to try this after hesitating a day because of the price (it&#x27;s not a big bottle) but decided my hair was worth it.  Unfortunately there is nothing so great about this shampoo, actually, I think it sucks!  My hair seems to fall out more then usual when I wash with this product.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the shampoo or conditioner since I bought the set but I feel like it&#x27;s money down the drain.  It does leave my hair soft (that&#x27;s for the 2 star).   I&#x27;ve also tried Original Sprout (which I got for my boys but is great for my hair too.  Also Alaffia is wonderful.  It has an interesting smell that I like but others may not.  Either way, it doesn&#x27;t linger on your hair.      Rahua is fancy (I first saw the product on Anthropology website) but not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s treat this review like a math proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given: Since hair types respond differently to products, it&#x27;s important to establish my quaff--fine, straight and survives multiple color treatments. It receives the most compliments right after shampooing and benefits from volumizing products (my weapon of choice: Sachajuan beach mist). In NY, it suffers from static fly-aways. In LA, it&#x27;s gravity and a heavy-handed, straightening iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that we&#x27;ve established hair type, assess whether yours is similar and proceed accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with the RA-RA, &#x27;miraculous&#x27; things Rahua did the first month:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I could go 3 days without washing my hair. All that pent-up hair envy I had of French girls subsided as I was inducted into the &#x27;my-hair-looks-better-dirty&#x27; club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It felt thicker and judging by the width of my ponytail, it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It was slightly less tangled fresh out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After awhile (washing every other day),&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I needed two dollops. Any less and it wouldn&#x27;t sud up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Hair felt heavy as if residual, original oils were building up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proof: If I used this twice a week along with a more \\&quot;clarifying\\&quot; shampoo, then that lovely, thicker texture I experienced in the first month was maintainable. Therefore, I would not advise using it as a go-to, daily shampoo. Since I used it so infrequently, it lasted a whole year (if that somehow helps justify the price).</li>
    <li> this product is great, but not from Amazon! It smelled rancid and not at all like the real thing, so I returned it. But if you get it thru Rahua, it&#x27;s totally worth it. Pricey, but this is a natural product that finally works as well as chemically-derived products. As a vegan, knowing that it&#x27;s animal testing free and has quality organic ingredients is worth the price tag. Get it, you won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
    <li> My wife &amp; I found out about this shampoo thru ewg.org, which has a massive (65,000+) database of health &amp; beauty products with science-based ratings of every single ingredient in the product, and it rates them numerically.  The vast majority of shampoos --- all beauty products really --- have chemicals in them that are shockingly bad for humans... endocrine/hormone disrupters, known carcinogens, skin allergens &amp; irritants, bioaccumulators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, lots of shampoos rate well on ewg.org, but good luck finding one that doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel limp, weighted, dull, frizzy.  This one rocks, it&#x27;s superior to any shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used (Phytology, Furterer, Klorane etc.), and has eliminated the need for any conditioners.  My hair feels and looks better than ever, and my scalp couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I think the product is great, but the servise of shipping the product to my house was not stable; the product was totally falling out. Please fix it!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best working natural shampoos around, and I tried many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the mysterious Rahua nut but it does really leave your hair in a good shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clean so violently as normal (SLS) shampoo so if your water is really hard (contains a lot of mineral) it might not work for you, because you could get buildup in your hair. Luckily this can be easily fixed with a little rinse of organic apple acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this to my mom, who&#x27;s not easy and stubborn as hell, and it actually made her switch from her much beloved \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; L&#x27;óreal shampoo.... something she said she&#x27;d never do.</li>
    <li> My hair looks and feels great. First natural shampoo that actually delivers. Took one star off for the price. But definitely try.</li>
    <li> This product has little lather but works well for my hair which is thick, coarse, and colored. Recommended by the California hair salon I visit when in town.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo. I have silver hair and it makes it shine and seems to take the &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; out. You do not need much too which is economical.</li>
    <li> works great as a sensitive scalp shampoo and on sensitive skin.  All natural ingredients are very hard to find in a shampoo.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a more natural, less chemical shampoo. I don&#x27;t really like how it makes my hair feel, but it&#x27;s not the worst.</li>
    <li> Loved the shampoo. I&#x27;m not sure why people say it doesn&#x27;t lather. It lathers up way more than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used. Also it&#x27;s a small bottle but it lasted me 5 months taking a shower every other day. It smelled amazing at first, I loved smelling it in my hair and knowing my hair was clean but after a month or two you get used to the smell and you don&#x27;t smell it anymore. I would love to continue using it but however it did not help at all with my dandruff and dry scalp issues, which was the reason I got this. I read on a site this is a great shampoo for dandruff, it worked amazingly for my dandruff the first time but after that my dandruff got horribly worse to the point where you can see the dry skin peeling off my scalp and dandruff everywhere. I really hope I can find the correct shampoo for that. Anyways it was the longest lasting, best smelling shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. So many great things about it and the only con was my dandruff which is the thing I needed help with the most. Also I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the shampoo but my hair has been thinning and falling out a lot more over the last few months. I&#x27;m only 19 so it must be the shampoo.</li>
    <li> without chemincals like papra bend or sulphates, the shamposs was great for my very fine straight hair.  It gave it body and made it so wasy for the curl to last.  Love it&lt;br /&gt;Camdace</li>
    <li> I got this to cure my dandruff &amp; it worked. I have curly hair &amp; it gets dried out &amp; frizzy easily. This product does cause it to be a little drier than before, but it&#x27;s not a problem as I just use more conditioner. The conditioner that goes with this shampoo isn&#x27;t conditioning enough. I don&#x27;t know why people say it doesn&#x27;t lather much. To me, it lathers the same as the paraben/sulfite shampoos.</li>
    <li> I have been a happy Biolage shampoo and conditioner user for years but wanted to switch to natural hair products without chemical additives. This product got good reviews, so I bought both the Rahua Shampoo and Conditioner even though they are expensive. I&#x27;ve been using both products for a week. This conditioner smells OK (not really much scent at all, kind of an oily smell), and I like the fact that it&#x27;s natural but don&#x27;t expect any improvement in your hair over a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; commercial conditioner and it is WAY overpriced for such a small bottle. The shampoo lathers nice but you have to use a lot. I&#x27;ll keep looking for a more reasonably priced shampoo and conditioner without chemicals because these are WAY overpriced.</li>
    <li> Small quantity that smells great and leaves your hair soft and &amp;#34;comb-able.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Hair feels so much healthier after using this product.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this is actually a very good sulfate-free, paraben-free all natural shampoo. I have shoulder length colored treated, wavy, dry hair and this shampoo really does help to treat all those things. My hair drinks it in. For a sulfate-free shampoo it produces a decent amount of lather and smells nice. Unfortunately, at this price the amount of shampoo that you get is borderline absurd...$30+ for 9.3 oz. YIKES! Only time will tell if I&#x27;ll ever decide to spend that MUCH on shampoo again, but still it&#x27;s good to know it&#x27;s out there if all else fails. Overall it&#x27;s a very good shampoo, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the lavish price tag.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever!  Worth every penny.  For brittle, dry or curly hair, this shampoo creates a softness that lasts for days.  I use the conditioner as well and just love it.  My color lasts longer too.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo ever...i love it!!</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly, color-treated, frizzy hair. I have tried as many products as I could think of. Those would be: tigi hair styling products, Loreal Expert Professional styling products, Loreal EverClear shampoo/conditioner; Redkin Ever Soft shampoo/conditioner. I have tried COUNTLESS serums as well (too many to name but the two most recent were Loreal expert serums). I have used a Hot Tools blow dryer for a couple of years and a Revlon round wire brush (for the blowout look). I bought 4 (yes 4!) hot curler sets. I use a Hot Tools (large barrel) spring curling iron (purple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after all of that... here is what actually WORKS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Rahua Shampoo and Conditioner, I use the It&#x27;s a 10 leave in conditioner and Loreal Smooth Intense Xtreme Straight Creme in my damp hair, I use the Olivia Garden 2 3/4 round brush, I use the DryBar Lemondrop Blow dryer (LOVE), I still use my Hot Tools large barrel purple spring curling iron. Then I finish it off with SEDU Antifrizz Polishing Treatment with Argan Oil.. then I add a bit of hairspray to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe what makes the difference is this shampoo/conditioner - the DryBar blowdryer - and the SEDU Antifrizz Polishing Treatment with Argan Oil. The Blow dryer is the absolute BEST!! After blowing my hair dry with this dryer, my hair is so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps... I am a HUGE review reader and did a ton of research. I bought a bunch of stuff on impulse but this is what works for me!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for many years and after very bad damage and irritation using the L&#x27;Oreal INOA system, I tried everything (Kerastase, etc) to help my damaged and brittle hair.  This shampoo (and matching conditioner) is the first one that really left my hair silky.  I prefer to use this shampoo in combination with their conditioner--I get better results. As long as it keeps working for me, I&#x27;ll keep buying it.  I suspect if you have oily hair, this shampoo and conditioner might be too heavy for you.  For my hair, it&#x27;s a God send!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  My hair was soft and shiny after the first use.  The price was great and shipping was fast.  Will definately purchase from this seller again if the Rahua conditioner and shampoo are available. Smells great</li>
    <li> I use nothing but natural, organic products but this stuff is just nothing special. It smells good, suds poorly, seems diluted and leaves my ends very dry. And it&#x27;s on the pricey side for a smallish bottle that you have to use quite a lot of for shoulder length hair. Their conditioning products are particularly bad. Not at all impressed and have had better results with my son&#x27;s Burt&#x27;s Bees Baby Shampoo. Seriously.</li>
    <li> perfect for my thin, fine hair  not harsh, but super effective...I love the product.</li>
    <li> This is shampoo, not a professional-grade gas grill for your outdoor kitchen. These folks need a new photographer. Like now.</li>
    <li> Love it...it&#x27;s the best shampoo ever and believe me I have tried several shampoos.  I have extremely fine hair and Rahua gives my hair so much body and fullness...Love It!</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading it on a few beauty blogs. To me, this stuff smells like black licorice and the smell tends to linger in your hair even after it dries. As for it working wonders, I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference. It is very moisturizing, I will admit to that. It was worth a try, but I probably won&#x27;t be repurchasing again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product exclusively for approx 1.5 years.  It has done wonders for my hair and I thought I&#x27;d never use anything else.  But the last bottle that I received was very diluted/the consistency had changed.  I had to use about 5 times more shampoo than usual, a serious amount!  And it still would not suds up like the product did before and my hair did not feel clean.  The shampoo was runny, whereas with all of my previous bottles, the product was so thick it would only slowly exit the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $32 a bottle, I&#x27;m rather peeved and won&#x27;t be risking ordering any more Rahua.</li>
    <li> really didn&#x27;t like this shampoo.</li>
    <li> left my hair greasy and unclean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not at all a good product esp for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;forest essentials is a much better organic ingredient shampoo</li>
    <li> I bought this based on a blogger review for getting rid of dandruff. It does not have sulfates/parabens that irritate the scalp. This also means it does not lather, so if you can&#x27;t get passed that like some other reviewers, it&#x27;s not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use a quarters worth on my scalp once a week. I&#x27;ve coupled this with a natural conditioner: vinegar, which I pour on my scalp to kill the overgrowth of yeast causing dandruff. So far I&#x27;ve been flake free for up to 6 days after 2 uses (2 weeks worth). My hair is shiny and healthy and like a different consistency entirely. Oh and my scalp is no longer itchy. Priceless.</li>
    <li> I really, really wanted to love Rahua. I purchased the travel size shampoo and conditioner in late November from a Stella Nova store. The ladies there told me to get the regular kind rather than the voluminous as the regular is more moisturizing. In the beginning, I saw some positive results--I washed my hair every other day as usual. The shampoo didn&#x27;t foam up but it seemed to be working. For a while even thought I was washing my hair less, I felt like it looked better. However, after about a month and a half my hair has never looked worse. It looked greasy and unwashed all the time. It looked nothing like my normal hair! I have since switched to good old drugstore shampoo, and my hair is back to normal again. What a mystery! I love that this is a natural shampoo and that it is sulfate and paraben free... but I think I would rather have nice hair! As a tip: definitely try the travel size first to see if it works for you!!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a shampoo and conditioner that would help repair my hair. I color my hair regularly for years as well as use straightening irons, hot curlers, blow dryers, etc. I use to have beautiful, luxurious and healthy hair, and I wanted it back. Not the cheap fuzzy stuffed animal looking hair I managed to create. Expensive shampoos, cheap shampoos, I tried them all. But I have finally found the perfect combination. I purchased Rahua shampoo and conditioner based on the reviews on Amazon. I started shampooing my hair every 3 days instead of every day. And I drink a glass of pure Acai juice every night with a Biotin tablet. I have been doing this ritual for 3 months and I cannot believe the difference in my hair -- not to mention my skin. I am a 50 year old woman and I am extremely happy with the results. I have been faithful to this new ritual, not missing a day on the juice and Biotin and using only the Rahua. Honestly, all I can say is WOW!! And I am not the only one who has noticed. People have asked me what I am doing or if I had any work done. Give it a try. It is relatively inexpensive and the shampoo and conditioner lasts a lot longer when you are only using them every 3 days. By the way, the shampoo does not have extreme lather, which is good. I read somewhere that when shampoos produce a lot of lather it means that there is a lot of detergent in the shampoo which strips your hair. So don&#x27;t worry about the lack of lather. You will get some, just not as much as when you use regular shampoos.</li>
    <li> Completely in love with this product, has transformed my hair!</li>
