      <li>The second time it happened I was more careful with the peel away.  </li>
      <li>So far 100% of the patches are still on although we&#x27;ve not sent anything through the washer yet.</li>

    <li> Amazing product.  I had a really hard time ironing on my daughter&#x27;s girl scout patches and this solved all my problems.  I have recommended it to our whole troop who also love it. Super easy to use and cut to fit any patch that you may have.</li>
    <li> Great shortcut to constantly sewing on Girl Scout patches. Drawback is that they don&#x27;t look as great as sewn on ones.  Still good product. I use all the time for Girls scout patches on vests.</li>
    <li> Easiest fastest way to apply badges and ships fast!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!&lt;br /&gt;Forget ironing or sewing...&lt;br /&gt;Magic Badge is the way to go!!</li>

    <li> This product is great for girl scout badges and fun patches. So easy and they stay on!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t sew...not at all. My Grandmother would be supremely ashamed, but with a daughter in Girl Scouts, I was desperate. These were perfect to attach her (many, many) patches to her uniform.  It held up during washes and the abuse of being worn by an energetic Girl Scout.  Save your fingers from holes, this product will work for you! All you need is a pair of scissors, a pencil and a kindergarten education. Put the patch on the paper, trace it, cut it out, then peel and stick. The best product ever invented if you ask me!</li>
    <li> This stuff works. My daughter is always bringing home fun patches from GS and I don&#x27;t have a sewing machine. This could not be simpler. Washed the vest twice, worn it at least 10 times, and everything is still holding up great.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I was so tired of having to sew on badges that were falling off my daughters Girl Scout vest. Very easy to use and the badges stay on.</li>
    <li> The only trouble I had was peeling off the front of my cut shape.  The sticky part that is suppose to stay on the bottom wouldn&#x27;t release from the top.  The second time it happened I was more careful with the peel away.  The shirt looked really nice.  I would order this product again.</li>
    <li> Love it, works great and easy to use!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for my grandson&#x27;s karate patches.  It it a wonderful alternative to sewing.  He will begin Cub Scouts in September and after having sewn Scout patches on for two sons, I&#x27;ve decided that Badge Magic will be my new choice for Scout patches as well.</li>
    <li> A little pricey but it works and it&#x27;s much faster\easier than sewing.  We&#x27;re using it for girl scout badges on the traditional sash and Indian princess badges on denim vests.  So far 100% of the patches are still on although we&#x27;ve not sent anything through the washer yet.</li>
    <li> Only thing that worked to secure Girl Scout badges!</li>
    <li> Great product, worked perfectly</li>
    <li> This kit is great - saves so much time and really does work. It is much easier to use this rather than having dealing with ironing them. I&#x27;m not sure how these will last through the wash, but for now it is serving its purpose.</li>
    <li> Works great for Girl Scout badges, as I do not sew and too lazy to learn.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I used to sew badges on - never again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic alternative to ironing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and they&#x27;ve left me disappointed. Even lost some badges. But Badge Magic works like it should and makes my life a lot easier...badges, hems, patching...all finished in no time because of this product.</li>
