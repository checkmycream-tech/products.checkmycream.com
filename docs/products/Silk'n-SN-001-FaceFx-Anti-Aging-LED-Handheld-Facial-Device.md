      <li>They do not have good customer service.</li>
      <li>I can confirm that the treatments feel good and there is subjectively some improvement to be gained.</li>
      <li>It is a good product and it helps with the skin care</li>

      <li>AMAZING, AMAZING DEVICE!</li>
      <li>However she is very pleased with this item.  </li>
      <li>so I was happy to be able to try this</li>

      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep using and update if the lines start to magically disappear!</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I don&#x27;t see amazing results yet.</li>
      <li>nice thing is that you can use this on your face and neck as well, not just your face, which I like.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I can honestly say I don&#x27;t see ant noteworthy improvements..</li>
      <li>(My face does get warm after use, as described, but nothing like a burn, and nothing that causes concern at all.)&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also kept going after having read it increased hair production on your face, and never saw anything of that kind happen either.</li>
      <li>The treatments feel so nice.</li>
      <li>I think I would&#x27;ve liked the results if I could have.  </li>
      <li>It is like a spa treatment and kind of relaxing.</li>
      <li>What have you done to your face look how nice your skin abd</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
      <li>Its a nice device</li>
      <li>This does warm up quite a bit, not curling iron warm, but much more than I</li>
      <li>I think the laser at dermatogist is stronger and more effective than this handheld one.</li>
      <li>The light intensity is strong and it does get very warm.</li>
      <li>Very good heat level - feels very warm, like a heating pad - extremely soothing</li>
      <li>My favorite thing about it, like all things beauty, is that you don&#x27;t have to DO anything.</li>
      <li>People think I am in my 40&#x27;s many times.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m trying to use more skin care products</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really glad I took a chance on this</li>
      <li>love the cream and oil</li>
      <li>okay, but stopped working, won&#x27;t charge anymore.</li>
      <li>Late-night infomercials have captured many into the world of skin cremes and anti-aging devices.</li>
      <li>I DON&#x27;T KNOW IF IT WORKS, NEED MORE TIME TO SEE THE RESULT.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sincerely Kendra Phoenix</li>
      <li>But for DIY, this device is okay.</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure if I put any pressure on it at all</li>
      <li>but I SURE hope so because I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>love what face FX has done to my face</li>
      <li>i went against my better judgement and ordered it.  </li>
      <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to use it EVERY day now that my eyelid is lifted</li>
      <li>I should have known better to return it then.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why so many reviewers are blown away by these types of machines because they don&#x27;t realize what&#x27;s going on and think its this \\&quot;miracle</li>
      <li>Okay, I&#x27;m a guy</li>
      <li>My face skin has better tone and my neck wrinkles are shrinking and the skin under my chin is tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My experience is that you will get more results from nutrition, hydration, exercise, moisturizing and micro-needling.</li>
      <li>As for expectations, it warmed and reddened the skin which I&#x27;m sure</li>
      <li>i looked better, but i wasn&#x27;t sure if i was imagining it.</li>
      <li>feel better after this</li>
      <li>wasn&#x27;t sure about this LED product.</li>
      <li>to the device, I love what it has done to my face, diminished wrinkles,</li>
      <li>Hoping the corded unit is more reliable.  </li>
      <li>I think the heat on the device would have to be greater to make the cream a necessity.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I decided to get it anyway.  </li>
      <li>If you value your time, you might find it more cost efficient to head for the doctors office and be done with it.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT...</li>
      <li>So, in addition to the time that&#x27;s one more product I have to buy and use.</li>
      <li>We really love it.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not sure if this product works. I really don&#x27;t see a change in my skin. Luckily my is in really good condition. I will continue to use it mainly for prevention of wrinkles. After a few months, this product stopped working...it does not hold a charge anymore. Save your money...it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about two years ago and used for about a year when it would no longer hold a charge.  I was able to return it and get a new battery for another $75 after paying $200 for the original.  In less than six months this one will no longer hold a charge either.  There are clearly issues here and the manufacturer (who is very mysterious) is doing nothing to upgrade the batteries or redesign the whole unit.  It may help a bit with a bit of rejuvenation, but not if you need a new battery every six months.</li>
    <li> I have had this for about 10 months, It works.  I am almost 66 years old.  Decreases the size of pores, which was my biggest concern. It also decreases the fine lines and helps with the loose skin on my neck, which I love.  I hate chicken neck.  I love this and would recommend it, as long as you use it, it works!  I use it for about 30 minutes at least three times a week, and enjoy using prior to bed as the heat is very soothing!</li>
    <li> I loved this device until the battery stopes keeping a charge after 2 months. Very bummed. Any ideas on how to fix it?</li>
    <li> I have been impressed at the results I have seen with FaceFX.  There is no other product that produces the caliber of results that FaceFX delivers.  Facefx is by far the leading product in it&#x27;s market.</li>
    <li> After a few weeks, just not seeing much to get excited about.  I will probably keep trying but had higher hopes based on reviews.  Certainly nothing compared to NuBrilliance microdermabrasion which was worth the extra cost.  That makes a huge difference around my eyes and mouth.</li>
    <li> Is&#x27;t okay, but stopped working, won&#x27;t charge anymore. Not THAT old to wear out this fast.</li>
    <li> My wife and I purchased this product recently and we&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by the results. After consistent use we are noticing our wrinkles and imperfections. My wife who has dry skin also purchased the FaceFx serum which was helped her skin feel more comfortable during use. We are still new users, but have been very happy so far.</li>
    <li> I am reviewing the Silk’n FaceFX Anti-Aging Device, but it is really my wife who is using it.  The device is a fairly cool looking item and it emits red light (645 NM wavelength) to ‘diminish the appearance of find lines and wrinkles, improve skin tone, color and appearance.’  The notion is to force cells to produce collagen, which seems to be a legitimate therapy (from what I gleaned from a couple of minutes googling the concept).  Do it work?  Maybe.&lt;br /&gt;My wife has been using it for two weeks, which is less than the recommended 3-7 weeks when results ‘should’ be noticeable.  But she is not interested in using the product anymore. While she said her skin felt a little tighter, it was difficult to keep the button compressed while moving it around her face in the recommended circular motions.  She said the low level of heat was relaxing, that the light didn’t seem to do much, but the need to keep the button depressed was uncomfortable in her hand.  She remarked that it’s possible her arthritis might make her ineligible for the device, but not for wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;My wife’s face was a little red (ruddy) after use and it looked fine, but it always looks fine to me.  After two week, she’s said that she’s done using it, whether its working or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the long and short if that it might work in the long term, but getting there might be a challenge, one that my wife chose not to beat. Her decision to stop using the device was not out of laziness...it simply was designed well to fit in her hand comfortably for usage.  I will offer the device to my sister (who is younger) and see if she would like to add any comments in coming days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 34, and have never done any type of &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; treatment besides normal upkeep with cleanser, exfoliator, toner and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I use a face mask. Once, I had a facial. My skin is basically fine. I live in Chicago, so we don&#x27;t really get sun damage here. Anyway, my moisturizer has SPF adequate for where I live.&lt;br /&gt;This product is total crap. It sucks to use, and is a really stupid gimmick. Don&#x27;t be lured in.&lt;br /&gt;Do you really want to spend 30 min every morning and evening rubbing this lame thing all over your face? For results that at best you need a microscope to see? Well, then you&#x27;re not me.&lt;br /&gt;You want to rejuvenate your skin, and encourage collagen formation? Want a free idea? Elizabeth Taylor used to rub her face with an ice cube every morning and evening in order to do the same thing that this product promises to do. Try that before buying this. She looked great, I&#x27;ll bet it works at least as good as this product.</li>
    <li> I asked for an extension in reviewing this item.  I no longer need the time, as it is clear to me what I am reviewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fist of all, there seemed to be either confusion among customers, or a quality-control problem.  I am not interested in a case to rest this item on.  It only works (light turns green), and gets warm on skin while plugged in.  It doesn&#x27;t appear to hold a charge.  Perhaps this is how it is supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is important to me is, &amp;#34;Does this unit do anything for my complexion&amp;#34;.  Perception is not good enough.  If it works it either does or doesn&#x27;t.  It appeared to work for a time, and I didn&#x27;t use it for a day, and realized my face looks no better.  I gave it a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now extremely self-conscious from looking at my frown and lip lines. I don&#x27;t get the impression that the company who makes this is answering queries.  Maybe I am wrong.  The &amp;#34;confusion&amp;#34; triggers my natural skepticism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I am too old and wrinkled to see results.  Perhaps this is my problem with this unit.  I appreciate having it, and will continue to update this if there is any change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.  I cannot draw any conclusions from this trial, and time will tell if I do.</li>
    <li> Silk&#x27;n SN-001 FaceFx Anti-Aging&lt;br /&gt;have used for several months and have seen NO RESULTS.&lt;br /&gt;SAVE YOUR MONEY. If I could I would return it, but they don.t give you enough time to see if it really works.&lt;br /&gt;You need 90 days to really see if this will work like they say. It does not.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> I followed all of the directions to the letter.  I was able to use it once.  After the one use, I wasn&#x27;t able to get it to turn on again, even though the device was fully charged.  I liked using it when I was able to, but was very disappointed and frustrated that I wasn&#x27;t able to continue.  I think I would&#x27;ve liked the results if I could have.  I had to send it back and get a refund.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still waiting...&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles. My main objective with the Silk&#x27;n was to tone or tighten chin and eye areas. I haven&#x27;t yet seen any big results, but I understand the tightening can take much longer than wrinkles. I will update this review if I see any improvement in the future.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it&#x27;s very time consuming. I&#x27;m not into beauty routines and I&#x27;d never go have any treatments done, so spending so much time on my face or looks is a little uncomfortable for me. Maybe I&#x27;m a little impatient?</li>
    <li> I asked my wonderful girlfriend for her opinion on this one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silk&#x27;n SN-001 FaceFx Anti-Aging LED Handheld Facial Device&lt;br /&gt;by Silk&#x27;n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read up on LED light therapy for skin and it seems to be a legit procedure that can have beneficial results for some people. I was interested to give this hand-held home device a try, just to see what it might do for me. At 50, I have very little wrinkling, but I do have some annoying lines starting to form on my forehead and I can see some faint smile lines coming on. My biggest concern is the area just below my jaw where the skin seems a little saggy. These areas will be my main focus as I continue to test this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial impression is that if this is indeed an effective derma treatment, then this little thing has got to be doing something. The light intensity is strong and it does get very warm. I can hear the sound of the cooling fan when I take it away from my skin. This is what keeps it from getting too hot. While using the Silk&#x27;n FaceFx, I can feel the warmth, but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable at all. The device makes a very faint buzzing sound, but does not vibrate in any way. I found that trying to run it over my clean skin was too draggy, so I put some very light primer on my skin, and that helped tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it&#x27;s too soon to tell if this is going to benefit my particular situation. I would really like to see what the long-term results are, and in order to do that, I&#x27;ll need to use it for longer than I really want to stand in the bathroom with it. I figure I can plug it in by my computer or by my bed and use it while I read rather than just staring at myself in the bathroom mirror. The time commitment is definitely the one drawback to a system like this, so I figure if I can multi-task with it, I&#x27;ll be more likely to continue using it to see if I get really noticeable results.</li>
    <li> I received the Silk&#x27;n Handheld Facial Device for review through the courtesy of the amazon vine program.  I sometimes wish there was no such thing as genetics. I wish that if I took good care of my body and my skin I would be rewarded by looking good as I aged without resorting to any kind of &amp;#34;treatments&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;gadgets&amp;#34; to help me. Least of all do I want to rely on lasers, peels or surgery. Although I have done my best to slow the clock, there is always that &amp;#34;genetic thing&amp;#34; that gets me. It pains me to say it, but my great-grandmother had a neck like a bullfrog. A male bullfrog. In mating mode. My grandmother had one, too, although slightly less so than her mom. And so on down to me, and I don&#x27;t want one. I have tried facial exercises - has anyone ever had success with those? - and creams called &amp;#34;facelift in a can&amp;#34; and so forth. Yeah, no.  So that&#x27;s my big reason for wanting to try an at-home LED device. I&#x27;m certain if it promotes the development of collagen and firms your skin, it will help me to at least slow down the inevitable ravages of time. Your needs may be different and you may have a different outcome than I, but after using the Silk&#x27;n FaceFx for three weeks, I have to say my results are negligible. I used it on my neck and jawline area for thirty minutes per day four days a week for three weeks. The manufacturer says it may take seven weeks to see real results so I am not ready to stop the treatments yet. I will keep going to give it a fair trial.  I haven&#x27;t needed any cream or oil to facilitate the movement of the device over my skin. I think the heat on the device would have to be greater to make the cream a necessity. You really do want to keep it moving, though, despite it not exceeding 41C, which is 105.8F. In using a heat/light device I was worried about creating dark spots on my face (after all these years of babying my skin!) but nothing like that happened. I also kept going after having read it increased hair production on your face, and never saw anything of that kind happen either. Whether I can end up reporting any positive results instead of just a lack of negative results remains to be seen.  I have read that the reason professional LED devices are effective is that the heat works to modify the collagen bundles deep inside your skin. It makes the collagen contract, and react as if it is undergoing trauma by stimulating the growth of new collagen. The process is called denaturation and does not take place at temperatures below 41C. This sounds good, and as long as the Silk&#x27;n device reaches and maintains the 41C needed to make the process take place it should work in the long run. But they only claim 41C is the Maximum Temperature you will get with their device.  The product manufacturer&#x27;s description of the benefits of the Silk&#x27;n FaceFx includes terms like Home Fractional technology, which brings to mind fractional laser resurfacing but is not the same thing at all. And I think terms such as &amp;#34;dermal levels&amp;#34; are just phrases coined by the manufacturer with no special significance. So cutting through the hype and looking at my personal experience so far with the Silk&#x27;n FaceFx, I would say the only reportable benefit I have seen as yet is a slight shrinking of the appearance of the pores in the areas I have used the device. This is nice, and might end up being enough of a benefit for me to keep using it for a mere 30 minutes a week after the initial seven week trial.  I will update after another couple of weeks and let you know if I see any progress. We&#x27;re all in this aging thing together, ribbit? I mean right?</li>
    <li> Judging the usability of this product is extremely hard to do - the results are not known for weeks of use, and the technology behind the product is mostly based on theoretical results. All studies on these products use terms like &amp;#34;are believed&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;the actual results will vary by skintype&amp;#34;. In other words - this may or may not work for you. That said, the technology isn&#x27;t entirely bogus (like magnetic bracelets), so it isn&#x27;t fair to give the product a poor rating based off on individuals results. In my case, I used it daily for three weeks, and didn&#x27;t see any difference - but then again, I also didn&#x27;t see my skin get worse (and it is summer), so it wouldn&#x27;t be right to produce a bad rating, as there are clearly enough people who DO see good results. I&#x27;ll leave it with this piece of scientific explaining about what goes on when you use the wand:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red light LEDs are also believed to target the skin’s oil glands to reduce cytokines, a class of pro-inflammatory substances believed to play a role in chronic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have acne (at the moment), so perhaps NOT breaking out is thanks to this device. I&#x27;ll never know...</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Meets expectations.  Been trying it for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really used it on a consistent basis, so can&#x27;t form a definitive opinion.</li>
    <li> Granted, I have only had this for a few days. I see a HUGE difference. I am 51. I am thinking I started using it at the right age. I have used it where I have seen aging. 1. Eyes they are now more lifted at the brow, and tighter at the corners. 2. Smile lines a much less defined. 3. Neck and throat area, tightened and lines are diminishing. 4. Sternum, skin is definitely less wrinkled. 5. My hands look rejuvenated, and to me look 10 years younger. My complexion is sensitive, instead of using their Dead Sea cream or serum they sent, I do my normal routine. I almost didn&#x27;t buy this because some people&#x27;s reviews on here were less than positive. I am hoping to remember to come back and report later the benefits of this. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for the info commercials and have been fooled into buying into &#x27;cream schemes&#x27;, with doctors and melons and stuff, that rob your bank account on a monthly basis and don&#x27;t work. After watching this on TV for a while and going through the reviews, I decided to give it a go. It was a 30 day trial, so I had nothing to lose. If it didn&#x27;t work or I had any problems, I&#x27;d just send it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 weeks now and I&#x27;m loving it. Noticeable differences: the skin around my eyes feels smooth and lines are disappearing. After one session, my neck is smooth. I&#x27;m still tackling the smile lines, but definitely seeing a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got it, I was using it every night, but now it&#x27;s 2 or maybe 3 nights a week. I spend about 30 mins in total, while I&#x27;m watching TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problems that I&#x27;m noticing from other reviewers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s not holding a charge. I&#x27;ve never had this happen to me and if it did, I would just send it back. I&#x27;m a terrible one for not reading instruction manuals, and just noticing that you&#x27;re not supposed to put it back into the unit while it&#x27;s still hot, not leave it charging while not in use, etc. I had been dong all of the above and leaving it charging for days on end, so have stopped doing that and just switching it on whenever I&#x27;m going to use it to prolong the battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The results are only temporary: aren&#x27;t all results just temporary, including Botox? If I can achieve these temporary results with this, then it&#x27;s well worth sitting for 30 mins a few times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s just helping to keep the face toned. It&#x27;s like every other area of our body, we keep on exercising to stay toned. I wouldn&#x27;t call it exercising right enough, but determined to keep it up because the results have been well worth it!</li>
    <li> Bought this at Costco and used this about a year, 3 times a week.  I am an older man in my 60s and it does work very temporarily.  Meaning it flattens out the wrinkles for about an hour, then they come right back.  Then I made an astonishing discovery, you can push any flat object against your face wrinkles and get the SAME results.  That&#x27;s why so many reviewers are blown away by these types of machines because they don&#x27;t realize what&#x27;s going on and think its this \\&quot;miracle machine\\&quot; that&#x27;s doing it. I am very sure the manufacturers are quite aware of this.  Anyhow, due to Costco&#x27;s return policy I was able to get my money back... verdict...waste of money</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t turn on for more than 2 sec after charging all night.  The way it sits in the charger makes it easy  to knock over.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! After just a few uses I saw a great improvement in the lines around my eyes and on my forehead. It even made my skin glow in a dewy way that no other product or treatment at the spa has. After two months of using I have virtually no lines around my eyes anymore. Would recommend this over an expensive treatment at spa or botox any day!</li>
    <li> Facial rejuvenation with no surgery or pain - is Silk&#x27;n FaceFX the answer to how to keep your face looking younger?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Temporary improvements in appearance along with pore reduction are what is promised in the instruction manual. Time required for the first month (4 weeks) is 15-20 minutes (5-7 minutes each treatment zone) a minimum of 3x/week. The maintenance schedule thereafter is once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this type of time commitment, I expected good results. Unfortunately, the time commitment didn&#x27;t pay off, even temporarily. To me, it is a lot of effort for no real results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silk&#x27;n FaceFX is hand-held, but need to plug in and stay plugged in to operate. The cord is long enough for me to plug in by my sofa to watch TV while the machine does its magic (or not).  The device is an LED device and the light emitted stimulates deep skin tissue. My sensitive self It has side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I&#x27;m not a fan of this product I really wanted to like it, but my results ere ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silk&#x27;n FaceFX</li>
    <li> The fountain of youth is something most of us are guilty of seeking out. Late-night infomercials have captured many into the world of skin cremes and anti-aging devices. When given the opportunity to try out this product from Silk&#x27;n, my ever-increasing wrinkles implored me to give it a shot. I was initially surprised to see a product like this offered on Amazon, as I immediately wondered about the medical implications and side effects of using such a product. I was even more surprised to find out that there are for the most part no side effects to using this product (but there are some disclaimers about who should not be using the product which I will detail in my conclusion). With this knowledge in hand, I decided to begin the experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this product is extremely easy, I&#x27;d liken it to using a rotary motorized razor, except without the loud sounds and pesky razor bumps. The instruction manual suggests using a moisturizer before applying the device, so I have been doing that and it really does seem to be helpful. The device has a warming sensation that feels great on the skin when applying. I&#x27;ve been focusing on the wrinkles forming around my eyes and have found that using the device daily for the past week has started to make some slight improvements, but not as much as other reviewers have reported. It may be a case of needing more time with the product, so I will update my review accordingly in the future if the results start to kick into 5 star territory, but so far, I&#x27;ve been rather pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scientific research shows that the fractional red lights emitted by the device can stimulate production of collagen and elastin and inhibit enzymes that break these substances down, leading to a much more youthful appearance, so there is a scientific claim to go on here that this product can indeed have a positive impact on your wrinkles. My final point of emphasis is to make everyone aware that there are several cases where people should not be using this product. Per the manual, if you have dark spots, moles, warts, psoriasis, birthmarks, eczema, or cold sores, you should not be using the product on the impacted area. Also, if you’ve had Retin-A recently, Accutane within the last 6 months, AHAs, BHAs, steroids, or a herpes outbreak, you should avoid using this product.le should not be using this product.

    <li> great product! i don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles but it worked great for my skin tone...very even it looks like when i wear my makeup now but i&#x27;m completely &#x27;naked&#x27;! Love it</li>
    <li> It is a good product and it helps with the skin care</li>
    <li> This machine really works see improvement on my face stomash and buttocks i use it everywhere easy to use</li>
    <li> I found the reviews of this product were bipolar: either they love it or the product is not properly working after first use.  I was hoping my purchase to fall into the former, but unfortunately, it did the latter.  I am returning this product.  Too bad.</li>
    <li> Who wouldn&#x27;t love the idea of spending a few minutes pulsing a little light on your face, and getting better skin as a result? That&#x27;s what this product promises, and although I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to know for sure, there do seem to be signs that it&#x27;s working (barely).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device itself is well made and seems like it will hold up to frequent use. This is a good thing as my chief complaint is how long it takes to use. If you value your time, you might find it more cost efficient to head for the doctors office and be done with it. On the other hand, if you don&#x27;t mind committing an hour or two per week, the Silk&#x27;n might be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It needs to be plugged in to work properly. Not a huge inconvenience as the cord is long enough to reach without problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the results, I&#x27;d say after a month, there are some very, very subtle changes. I took a few close-up photos before starting...fine wrinkles seem a little more fine, and pores seem maybe a little tighter overall. Very subtle overall, but I&#x27;m only a month into it. I intend to give it several more months, and that will help me decide whether it&#x27;s truly worthwhile or just a scam.</li>
    <li> The Silk&#x27;n Device stopped working after two months. I tried contacting the company, as the device is still under warranty. I was told to send to an address in California for repair. I sent in immediately and never heard from them again.  Home Skinovations said my return was accepted and to send it in with the receipt, which was done just as explained to me.  Home Skinovations has never answered any further e mails from me. The result is that I do not have any device and my $208.00 appears is gone. No product.</li>
    <li> I used this maybe 10 times then had to put it away for awhile due to having thyroid problems and not being able to tolerate the heat from the device. It was quirky when from the very beginning...I should have known better to return it then. When i took it out and charged it again after sitting for about 6 mos, I charged it repeatedly...it kept dying immediately.  Now, I paid about $250 for this at one of the home shopping networks.  I didn&#x27;t listen to the reviews saying the same thing. I should have.  It&#x27;s simply shameful to sell such a defective product.  In addition, when you are selling something rather expensive that is chargeable, you better put in a rechargeable batter that is replaceable! This is the same issue I have with iPad. No replaceable battery. When it dies, you&#x27;re SOL unless you are still under warranty.  I see this has come down in price to $99, but still buyer be warned.  You may end up with a dead product.  Personally, I got the impression that it was the serum that improved skin more than the actual device, as I have used it alone.</li>
    <li> horrible product!!  Burnt the area near my eyes and made my vision blurry for days!  still in pain and hard to be in bright lights.  Don&#x27;t buy this product!!!!</li>
    <li> The off-on switch needs to be easier read to know if it is off or on. Pushing the button leaves one wondering which mode is which.  After two uses can&#x27;t get it to work...even after following instructions to the T.  Am very disappointed as I did have higher expectations.  Not overly expensive, but had hopes of getting to use it long enough to see results. :-(</li>
    <li> I had been using this product for about 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any positive results.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s time consuming, and in the long run, I have worries that I may be doing more harm than good.  Possibly incorrectly stretching the skin the wrong way, and that may cause worse problems in the future.&lt;br /&gt;If I decide to look for that miracle fix, it&#x27;ll be done by a professional, as it should be.</li>
    <li> I am cautious in using the product but do believe it is helping with my complexion and fine lines</li>
    <li> While it is not one of the headline benefits that are claimed by this product, I was personally excited to give it a shot for its claims about pore reduction. I was also hoping that it might help smooth out the tone of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being that I have rather large pores, if a product is working towards their reduction, it is relatively easy to tell if it&#x27;s getting the job done. For example I used [[ASIN:B00GJ7TNX8 bliss Micro Magic Microdermabrasion Treatment, 3 fl. oz.]] for a while, and, before I stopped using it because it was getting too costly, I could easily discern that my pores were shrinking. In contrast, even after several weeks of using the Face FX, I did not notice even the slightest bit of improvement. The same was true of my skin tone; although I really wasn&#x27;t expecting results in that arena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife was more concerned with the fine lines around her eyes and mouth. She did feel as if, after repeated uses, there were temporary improvements in the appearance of fine lines, but that any improvement quickly faded. She compared it to the reduction of fine lines - due to mild swelling - that might result if one were to pinch themselves, which would ultimately diminish as the swelling subsided. Even though the results, in her mind, are far from permanent, she believed that she might have continued to utilize the product on a regular basis if it were not for the nonexistent battery life. I certainly agree on this point, the battery life is ludicrously limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the very best, if this product is working as claimed, the positive effects appear to be brief. I just don&#x27;t feel as if the very limited results are worth the time, energy, and money.</li>
    <li> I saw this device one time when I visit my in-law&#x27;s place.  I was curious and din&#x27;t know what it was until I saw it on TV.  I was so eager to try this device but at age 38, my skin is still well toned.  So, looking for a way to use it, I tested it on the only body part that is wrinkled for me.. that thing somewhere between my legs!  The first treatment didn&#x27;t show significant change, so I have to visit my in-law&#x27;s place often to sneak out in the bathroom and use this device.  After 3 treatments, lo and behold!, that wrinkled thing between my legs is now smoother than before!  I was so amazed that I have to show it to my wife and she was so happy with it!  My wife said that the thing between my legs is now like a baby&#x27;s skin! I was so proud of it that I started bragging about it.  That was my big mistake, my mother in-law discovered where I was using this and she has not spoken to me ever since.  I couldn&#x27;t visit their place anymore either, so I decided that I have to buy one for myself too.</li>
    <li> Does not hold charge, but after talking to the company - you have to let it discharge completely before putting it back on the charger. Somewhat like a cell phone battery. They DO NOT TELL you anywhere about that little tidbit. Otherwise, it works rather well.&lt;br /&gt;Because I couldn&#x27;t find the invoice, I have to buy a new one. Keep your invoice!! They will replace it.</li>
    <li> Not sure this does much of anything....I have had this unit for 5 months now and used it faithfully 3-5 days a week for 5 months and I can honestly say I don&#x27;t see ant noteworthy improvements..I took BEFORE and AFTER photo to compare and still look the same. No one noticed ANY changes to my skin tone or complexion. Save your money for actual fillers or skin tightening procedure at dermatologist office as this is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have been reading so many reviews on the Silk&#x27;n FaceFX Anti-Aging LED Handheld device and all of them are mixed.  Here is what I can tell you.&lt;br /&gt;The handheld device is really easy to use. You will plug it in and see and orange light, press the on switch and you will see a blinking green light. Once the light is green you can proceed. We all know green means go! Put the FaceFX to your skin and the lights will turn on. You will feel a little heat coming off it. Now just work the device slowly around your face. Each session should last about 10-15 minutes. I slowly worked up to that time from 5 minutes because I like to test things slowly when using them on my face. I now do about 3 sessions a week for 10 minutes each. Working my whole face. After I am done I use a wash cloth with cold water to close the open pores from the heat. I then apply a light moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light therapy isn&#x27;t as strong as one you would go to a skin specialist at a salon but that isn&#x27;t a negative because the cost of that treatment can range $80-$200 a visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light therapy is used to produce collagen in the skin. Basically called red light that can improve your skin’s ability to heal and generate new collagen after its production has slowed due to age or damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heat from the device reaches about 40 degrees and you will hear a fan inside the hand held device go off to keep the unit from getting too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t see amazing results yet. I do think that the fine lines around my eyes have definitely been reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue use and will update this review periodically.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m starting to get to the age where I&#x27;m more concerned about signs of aging on my face, neck and chest.  I&#x27;m trying to use more skin care products so I was happy to be able to try this device.&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of trying it out, I would say that it does improve the appearance of my skin but it takes some work to follow the instructions exactly and to use it often enough.  I keep a very busy schedule and it sometimes slips my mind to use it as often as I should.  If you are willing to use this regularly and keep using it regularly you will likely notice at least a small improvement in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;One nice thing is that you can use this on your face and neck as well, not just your face, which I like.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself was easy enough to use without any trouble.  I would recommend this product to those who want to try an LED product on their skin, but only if you are willing to use it regularly to maintain your results.</li>
    <li> Love it. I had the original one for almost a year. The battery lost its charge. The newer one with the plug in is wonderful. No need to worry about the battery.</li>
    <li> I used this product 4-5 times each week for nearly a month, but saw absolutely no difference in the appearance of my skin.  It was a big time commitment - almost half an hour each time I used it - so I expected to at least see some small change, but there&#x27;s no visual difference.  Perhaps if I had more defined lines and wrinkles, there&#x27;d be something to see, but as of right now I&#x27;m inclined to think the product is a scam (or else my unit is defective).</li>
    <li> I have been using this machine now for a couple of years and IT DOES WORK! it is better than any other lighting device for anti-aging.  I have had no problems with the machine breaking down and the fine lines are totally gone around the eyes, mouth area no lines and I am approaching 60.  I will use this device for the rest of my life. You do have to use it faithfully and at least the minimum time they recommend and for the rest of your life.  AMAZING, AMAZING DEVICE! It is best to start as young as you can because there is no miracle product or device that can totally lift you up if you are at a point where you are heavily sagging or have very deep etched in lines.</li>
    <li> The two stars is mainly for the battery charge not holding up much at all.  I noticed the charge didn&#x27;t last after the first use but stopped charging completely after several months.  If it wasn&#x27;t for that then I would give it 3.5 stars since I sid notice a slight difference of softer skin, smaller pores and somewhat less fine lines.  The heat feels really great!</li>
    <li> Did not work after the first day.  I had read reviews and saw a few people mention that it would not hold a charge after a day.  i went against my better judgement and ordered it.  First day worked, second day would not start.  I just would save yourself the hassle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THE PRODUCT RELIGIOUSLY FOR ABOUT A MONTH NOW...&lt;br /&gt;THE TEXTURE OF MY SKIN IS GREAT...STILL SEE SOME CREASING AND WRINKLES UNDER THE EYE AREA, BUT I&#x27;M HOPEFUL THAT IN ANOTHER MONTH THAT WILL DIMINISH AS WELL...LOVE IT...</li>
    <li> I am disappointed with this device . In other words it does not meet my expectations. First of all when I use the device it creates age spots and then I need to buy creams to get rid of the age spots. The age spots do not seem to disappear with usage of the device. The Siruis device has a different head for getting rid of age spots , rejuvenating the skin and another head for getting rid of small wrinkles. I think this device would be more efficient. Secondly, it is difficult to obtain the lubricant to use with the device and so it is sometimes difficult to get the device to glide across the skin. The machine does not work well at the side of the face where there are crows feet. The results seem to be effective but by the next day it seems that we are back at square one. Overall I do not recommend this device.</li>
    <li> This is a good product suffering from a bad user manual and confusing product marketing.  The unit I got is not rechargeable.  It does not have a charging base, just a cord and if the cord is not plugged in it doesn&#x27;t work.  The question of &amp;quot;rechargeable or not&amp;quot; seems to be creating a lot of confusion in the reviews and in the questions and this is entirely the manufacturer&#x27;s fault: every photo of this product in use shows it being used cordlessly.  In the video on this page the product is shown in a recharging base.  In addition, if you read the questions on this page just above the reviews several questions address this issue and the answers indicate that some people receive a rechargeable unit with a base and some do not.  I would suggest if you are interested in this product you should expect that it will not be rechargeable and if you get a rechargeable one you should consider it a bonus.  Kind of crazy, eh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I was really surprised when mine wasn&#x27;t rechargeable but after I got over it I found I really like the device.  It feels great when I use it - it warms my skin and leaves it feeling just slightly tingly.  I&#x27;m at that age where I&#x27;m starting to see more lines on my face than I&#x27;d prefer so I&#x27;d love it if I could slow down that process even a little (is reversing it a bit too much to hope for?  We&#x27;ll see.)  I haven&#x27;t used it for long, but I&#x27;m planning on using it religiously and I&#x27;ll update this review with the results.  I&#x27;ll even take some before and after photos to share.  I&#x27;m crossing my fingers and hoping for a little magic!</li>
    <li> I am  impressed. This thing mostly shoves the water around and absorbs hardly anything. Also even after my standard couple of washes before use it feels harsh to my hand and I&#x27;m sure if I put any pressure on it at all it would micro mar the paint. My old &amp;#34;cheapie&amp;#34; 320GSM towels are softer, safer and better at absorbing water.</li>
    <li> I have to say that after a week in strict accordance with the manual as to proper usage I notice no difference whatsoever rather than a slight redness after use that goes away after a while. The item itself does seem to be well built and the manual is clear and very detailed. The directions do say that it takes 3 or more weeks to get the full desired effect so maybe it&#x27;s too soon to tell. But it does seem that there should be some reaction after 8 days. I will continue to use as directed &amp; update this review after the prescribed time or upon receiving any noticeable benefits from using this. If it doesn&#x27;t work at least it seems to be harmless. The jury is still out on this.</li>
    <li> Five to seven WHAT? I have the attention span of a gnat, so it was really difficult for me to use this by moving it around on one part of my face for five to seven minutes. I passed the time for a couple of minutes by opening my mouth and looking at the funny patterns I could make on the inside of my cheeks. But I am one of those people who have a hard time brushing for two minutes and if my toothbrush didn’t have a timer, I would cheat on it every time. However, the warmth on my face felt really relaxing, which make it much more likely to be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just starting the smallest amount of research, I am seeing a lot of amazing things that red light therapy can do for skin.  It is impossible to know what the dermatologist can do that his machine will or can&#x27;t do. I assumed it was a new kind of snake oil and didn’t really think that it would work. Some of the pictures are obviously touched up and some of the before and after pictures are clearly of people with and without tans… Tans, if you think about it, correct a lot of issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red light therapy needs to heat the skin enough to stimulate collagen and elastin. This does warm up quite a bit, not curling iron warm, but much more than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit that I was a serious skeptic when I first heard of these red light devices but there seems to be some science that supports that the Photothermolysis is temporary. If you are willing to do this consistently, then it is more likely to give results.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work...........I would give anything to return it.......... Don&#x27;t buy this it&#x27;s a rip off !!!! The money isn&#x27;t worth it......</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;m a guy and I decided to try this appliance for my face. I have some sun spots and my complexion is not perfect. There are some wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;First, I used some vitamin C serum on my face after cleaning and toning.  Then plugged in the Silk&#x27;n FaceFx.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the wall wart that plugs in is upside down (in my opinion).  The larger portion of the converter is facing up so it will block the other outlet unless it&#x27;s plugged into the top slots on your outlet. (Okay enough ranting about the power supply)&lt;br /&gt;The unit has an on-off button and some LEDs on the switch which tell you it&#x27;s powered on.  Applied to the face for 5-7 minutes in sections for about 20 minutes total.  Do this 3 times a week for the 1st month. After that once a week for 15-20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The surface get warm to hot as it lights up the red LEDs.  After treatment I applied some moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;So, my results after about 3 weeks of use is I can&#x27;t tell much difference.  I will continue to use is for the prescribed 4 weeks and see if anything has improved.</li>
    <li> feel better after this</li>
    <li> UPDATE: The manufacturer contacted me (see comments) after seeing my initial review, and offered to send a replacement corded unit for $75. They also emailed me directly about it. 8 months ago, I emailed them back and tried calling the toll-free number to pay the $75 to get the replacement and sat on hold for about 5 minutes before it told me no one was available. I left a message with my phone number, and never received a call back. I also emailed them several times after that inquiring and leaving several numbers they could call. I finally just gave up and bought another one elsewhere for $25 more than they were going to charge me to replace the defective unit. Not impressed with the product quality of the cordless unit, nor with the customer service or how the company stands behind their product. Did like it well enough to re-order but feel like I have been ripped off. Hoping the corded unit is more reliable.  ORIGINAL REVIEW I had read reviews on this product that seemed generally favorable as far as the results it delivers and the use of it being enjoyable. But there were also a number of reviews complaining how it would not hold a charge or would quit working altogether after a certain amount of time. There was a groupon for it about a year and half ago, so I decided to take the plunge. I can confirm that the treatments feel good and there is subjectively some improvement to be gained. However, just as many others had indicated, as time went on the battery seemed less and less reliable about charging until finally several months ago the light would stay on only intermittently, and the unit would just shut off shortly after beginning a session, even on what was supposed to be a full charge. Now I cannot get it to stay on for more than a few seconds most times, and when it does stay on the light keeps flickering on and off or just goes off, leaving only the heat and fan running. For as much as these things cost, you should not have to buy a new one every 13 to 18 months (conveniently just after the warranty runs out.)</li>
    <li> Silk&#x27;n FX does nothing to improve the face. It also will not hold a charge after only 2 months of use. The seller will not return my phone or email messages. I am owed a refund..</li>
    <li> Preface: 44 years old, fair skinned. Minimal wrinkles, light sagging. Was hoping to alleviate one problem area around the jaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this 3x a week for the past few weeks and have seen no noticeable change. The treatments are time consuming and hard to work into my schedule. I don&#x27;t like having to block out fairly large amounts of time for upkeep. It must be used with some kind of oil or else it is highly uncomfortable to run over skin. So, in addition to the time that&#x27;s one more product I have to buy and use. Some concern about whether it will end up causing future skin/health problems.  I will be going back to my normal cleansing and moisturizing routine which has served me pretty well so far.</li>
    <li> After charging this unit for over 24 hours, until the light became green, I turned it on, and ... No effect. I plugged it in again... After going through this cycle several times, I have come to conclusion that this is not going to get better. The unit would turn on the red light while still on the power cord, but only after being plugged in for some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky that a lady I know agreed to take the unit and let me know her impressions after using it for some time. After using it for about 10 days, she said that, while using the unit with the cord is very uncomfortable, she liked the tightness she felt on the facial skin after using the unit. Nevertheless, I have not noticed any changes on her face after close observation.</li>
    <li> I am nearly 60 and religiously use a retinol product every night, and basically love to take care of my skin.  I saw this little device and saw the infomercial, and thought I would try it.  I absolutely love it.  I use it every other day, with the squalane solution that came with it used fairly liberally over my face so the product glides easily over the skin.  I find it very, very, relaxing, and my skin is looking even better.  People think I am in my 40&#x27;s many times.  I love hearing this!  Of course, smokers and sunworshippers may not experience the same results or it may take longer.  I have not had a problem with the batteries not holding a charge.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> When I read the reviews on this product ,that it had trouble holding its charge, and some had even experienced it had stopped working after the first use, I thought-- &amp;#34;what&#x27;s the likelihood of this happening to me?&amp;#34;  So I took a chance and purchased it.  On first use, it charged as it was supposed to and was ready for use once the green fully charge indicator was illuminated.  Like some reviewers said, it was very pleasant to use because of the warm light emitted by the facial head&#x27;s LED light on the skin.  After I used it, I did not charge it again, thinking that since I&#x27;d charged it overnight , it would be fine to use again without charging.  That was not the case, so I charged it again overnight.  Once, the indicator went from orange to green, I thought I in fact had the &amp;#34;green light&amp;#34; to again use the devise.  This time when I tried turning it on, the devise wouldn&#x27;t turn on, and the green light would just sort of surge up when I held the power button,  but once I released the button, the green light seemed dim.  When I tried to put the device back on the charger, the indicator light vacillated between orange and green but the device never turned on again!  I think this phallic-shaped device is just poorly designed -- particularly the charger , which does not seem to approprately cradle the device for a good strong charge.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this one.  This product needs to be recalled!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for 3 weeks now and have not seen much difference as yet.</li>
    <li> I DON&#x27;T KNOW IF IT WORKS, NEED MORE TIME TO SEE THE RESULT.&lt;br /&gt;IT SAID NEED 5 WEEKS TO SHOW THE DIFFERENCE.</li>
    <li> I love my FaceFX especially when I combined it with essential oils! I have noticed an immediate difference since using the FaceFX red light therapy. About 3 weeks ago I started using essential oils (sparingly) in combination with the FaceFX serum and the results are super-charged. My face has cleared and the wrinkles are noticeably reduced. The essential oils absorb better with the warming effect of FaceFX.....unbelieveable combo. You have to make sure the essential oils are pure with no additives, though, to get the expected results. Frankincense is one of the essential oils that encourages new cell growth. The anti-aging oil blend &amp;#34;Immortelle&amp;#34; is what I have been using. It&#x27;s a little pricey because it has Frankincense, Sandalwood, Lavender, Myrrh, Helichrysum and Rose, but it&#x27;s the real deal. If you are interested in checking it out.....the link is.....mydoterra/ej.....I just started using both of these products (FaceFX and doTerra) and I can&#x27;t believe that no one has thought of using them together. WOW is all I can say.</li>
    <li> i order Silk&#x27;n SN-001 FaceFx Anti-Aging LED Handheld Facial Device .first order missing cream and replacement send me same as missing cream</li>
    <li> I just did fx face this morning. I did it on one side so I could compare it. I saw IMMEDIATE results. I did 7 minute&#x27;s on 3 part&#x27;s of my face. I rubbed argon oil to make is slide easier. It died when I tried using it 2 day&#x27;s later, hasn&#x27;t worke since!!!</li>
    <li> So far so good.  No problems of a technical nature. Proverbial time will tell - pun intended .  Amazon is a pleasure to deal with . Sincerely Kendra Phoenix</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to know if it&#x27;s working or not.  You don&#x27;t see any immediate results and I&#x27;m not very motivated to keep using it, so who knows?  It&#x27;s a very subjective thing and that&#x27;s why I just gave it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I bought the Face FX and used it faithfully for a year believing all of the hype about it.  I saw no difference from its use. However, I continued using it until it just stopped working completely.  It wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge after being in its charger all night. I finally just threw it away.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> This worked for about 6 months and then broke and iShopHappy is NOT covered under Silk&#x27;n&#x27;s 1-year guarantee. Don&#x27;t buy from them. A complete waste of  money. I went through the whole ordeal with Silkn trying to get a replacement but they don&#x27;t cover this seller. Have to throw it out now. :(</li>
    <li> Best decision I&#x27;ve made. Needed to tighten the lines next to eyes, but couldn&#x27;t/didn&#x27;t want to pay  thousands for face lift. But when came across various ways to rid lines, this was one of fast, instant, most affordable way. So..I took the chance, purchased it, and saw an instant difference. It even help rid of dark spots, lines, and rejuvenate from sun damage. Used it on my mom, husband (sun damage), daughter. They look years younger. Now, can&#x27;t live w/o my Silk&#x27;n Facefx. Highly recommend one!! Get a face lift right at the palm of your hand.</li>
    <li> I read the mixed reviews about this product. I thought I would try it thinking maybe the bad reviews were a little too critical. The unit was charged after I received it. It seemed to work as described. The battery would not fully charge after initial charge to a full charge. I tried to use it several times and all efforts were failures. The concept is good, but poor performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon for such good customer service as the item was returned with no problems.</li>
    <li> I bought the FaceFX after seeing the amazing results my best friend got with hers - she couldn&#x27;t stop talking about it!  And once I started using mine I couldn&#x27;t stop talking about it either.  The treatments are so easy it&#x27;s not a hassle to keep it up, which has been my issue with other products in the past.  The best perk is that I can use it in my own home, whenever it&#x27;s convenient for me!  So great.</li>
    <li> I find that this makes a difference, but there are some cautions, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some relevant info: I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s with pale skin and have an oily complexion and &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34;... there are a number of skincare products that are too harsh for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Does actually improve skin tone and diminish wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;2. I have a skin type that sunburns easily and reacts to some beauty products; I don&#x27;t have any bad reactions to using this device. (My face does get warm after use, as described, but nothing like a burn, and nothing that causes concern at all.)&lt;br /&gt;3. I am leery of using this near my eyes, so I avoid my crow&#x27;s feet. But it&#x27;s helped on the &amp;#34;necklace&amp;#34; of wrinkles I have on my neck, around the mouth area, and between my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. There is some controversy/disagreement about the long-term health implications of using red LED therapy, and whether it might be associated with cancers. However, I can&#x27;t find a study on pubmed, so it might all be hearsay / internet gossip.&lt;br /&gt;2. Please be especially careful near your eyes, which of course are especially delicate. I suggest that you close your eyes while working anywhere near your eyes, so that you&#x27;re not shining the LED directly onto your eyeball. Even with eyes closed, I still think it&#x27;s questionable to work on the eyelid, for example... you&#x27;re still deliberately heating up your eyeball.&lt;br /&gt;3. The LEDs are set back from the edges of the device, which means it&#x27;s hard to shine the LEDs on your crow&#x27;s feet without getting what I consider to be too close to my eyeballs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously:&lt;br /&gt;1. This is not going to entirely make wrinkles go away. It diminishes them. The video seems to me to set reasonable expectations&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this four stars because it does what it says; decremented one star because of the safety concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FWIW, mine has a cord, not a battery and charging station.</li>
    <li> Fun to use. I do see results.</li>
    <li> I bought this item through groupon. It was the device and the serum (which is also on amazon and very pricey) for $149+ tax, not sure why groupon started charging me tax recently but it&#x27;s a little annoying maybe they opened an office in Nevada. Like another reviewer mentioned I almost changed my mind once I read the suspicious reviews. I&#x27;m so glad I decided to get it anyway.  The treatments feel so nice. I&#x27;ve only had it for a week and used it twice so far. My skin looks so smooth after and I think I see results all ready. I was planning to get botox but since now I feel I can avoid it or at least put it off this has saved me money. The serum is oil based which worried me because even though I&#x27;m in my thirties I&#x27;m still prone to breakouts but no problems so far plus I&#x27;ll just wash my face after if it becomes an issue. Once the serum runs out I&#x27;m going to try it with my argan oil. Im excited to see how my skin looks in a month. I&#x27;ll try to remember to update my review. I&#x27;ll be using it three times a week for twenty minutes while watching tv lol.</li>
    <li> So I am on Week 6 of using this product.  I&#x27;ve been taking pictures  - one set at the beginning and then one set starting at 3 weeks.  I am looking for improvement in my lines -- particularly around the mouth and cheeks.  My husband says he can see a difference but I am not so sure.  Also, if you do it, be prepared for the shock of taking a close up picture of yourself with no makeup!</li>
    <li> I love it! great product</li>
    <li> Nerdy pricey and no results seen.</li>
    <li> I used it 3 times and now the green light won&#x27;t stay on.  It&#x27;s fully charged but will not come on.  I&#x27;m sending it back so I won&#x27;t know if it does any good.</li>
    <li> Worked fine at first, but after a few weeks, the device needs to be charged after every use. Sometime it runs out before the session is over. Instructions were not in English and it shipped from Israel.</li>
    <li> I bought this to basically take care of sagging eyelids &amp; an aging face.  No, it hasn&#x27;t stopped me from aging; however, I am seeing some improvements in the look &amp; feel of my skin!!!  My eyelids no longer cover my eyes.  No, they don&#x27;t look like they did when I was 20...then again, 20 was a long time ago!!!  To be honest, I haven&#x27;t had this product long enough to experience its full effect &amp; I will be back with an update after using it for a bit longer.  I&#x27;m feeling encouraged with the progress I&#x27;m seeing o far &amp; have high hopes for more improvements with a little more time!!!</li>
    <li> I like to follow new trends in beauty, and about a year ago, I picked up Illumask, a red light anti-aging device that looks like the mask Jason wore in Friday the 13th. It cost about $30 ($20 on sale) and it works for 30 uses (you can apparently restart it with instructions on Youtube, but I never tried.) I was very pleasantly surprised by the change in the texture of my skin with it. My favorite thing about it, like all things beauty, is that you don&#x27;t have to DO anything. You put it on your face, lean back, and relax for the 15 minutes it takes for a treatment. Neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silk&#x27;n&#x27;s FaceFx is promising. I had no problem at all using it, cause I totally get the &#x27;red light&#x27; thing which works on my skin. The problem, and one of the good things, is that this requires work. The head of the device isn&#x27;t large, so how long should you be holding it in one area? You never know how long 15 minutes can feel until you&#x27;ve held something up to your face and waited. And waited. With your eye on the clock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fear, though, because of the effort involved in simply holding this thing, I&#x27;m not going to use it as much as a Jason mask that requires I close my eyes and do nothing. What I do like Silk&#x27;n for is use on the neck and chest; that makes sense (I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d want to see the mask they&#x27;d need to cover that part of your anatomy; it&#x27;d look like a suit of white plastic armor.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;d recommend Silk&#x27;n for those body parts that need some anti-aging love and aren&#x27;t treatable with a mask. But for the beauty slug in us all, I&#x27;m sticking with Illumask. Sitting still and closing my eyes for 15 minutes? Yeah, that I can do.</li>
    <li> scammy, does exactly NOTHING</li>
    <li> I wish I could say I had the opportunity to see if this device would produce any real results, unfortunately it stopped functioning after only 6 days - the charging base said it was fully charged, but the machine would not turn on. While it was actually functioning, I thought the unit was heavy and clunky, and that the shape made it awkward to get around the eye area which is where I primarily wanted to use it. Would definitely not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Ok I like this device and this is my third. It has the absolute worst electrical engineering design. The past 2 just stopped holding charge. This one you cannot unplug at all. Waiting for it to break. Cmon. Fix this. Its a nice device</li>
    <li> not sure this help my face .would take long cler my face ?</li>
    <li> I used it one time and got really excited about it.  It felt like it was really working.  The next day it would not even take a charge.</li>
    <li> If I had known this product was made in Israel I never would have hesitated as long as I did to finally purchase it.  This product has worked as described at reducing laugh lines and other lines in my face due to aging.  It does take a few minutes to use on each area you want to work on but after a few weeks you will see that the lines have dramatically been reduced and some are totally gone!!</li>
    <li> I saw the wonderful reviews from June 2012 and purchased the product through Amazon from psychcultulture. I paid $266.00 and waited for it to be shipped from Israel. The device wouldn&#x27;t even take a charge. That was when I checked the reviews from November 2012 and saw the negative reviews about its manufacturing flaws. I returned it, but couldn&#x27;t afford the $150.00 Fed Ex shipping and had to send it with no insurance through USPS. Will it get there and will I be refunded my money? I don&#x27;t know. Make sure you buy it through an American distributor so you can be assured of insurance coverage and a signature on arrival. I plan to purchase it again through an American distributor after the reviews show positive results.</li>
    <li> A great device. We really love it.</li>
    <li> First, I need to state that I did not buy this item from Amazon.  I do use red light therapy at Planet Beach spa.  I bought this gadget for spot treatments.  The device worked about a year and a half and I did NOT use it consistently.  The first unit arrived and only worked for a few days.  My vendor replaced it upon the return of the original unit.  Regarding the second unit, I probably used it consistently off and on but definitely not for the entire year and a half that I owned it.  In the beginning I could use the device for about 40-45 minutes at a time.  Then slowly, minute by minute, the device started subtracting time.  By the time it finally gave out, I could only get a charge of about 5 minutes.  Eventually it would not charge at all.  As far as it working, I have no idea.  I could never really tell.  However, I do a lot of things for my face.  I completely stay out of the sun, always wear sun block, use good products, eat well, gym rat, and take supplements.  So, who knows.  This unit is now trash to me.</li>
    <li> Lasted only for a year with not every day use. No battery replacement. Unless you are experienced do-it-yourselfer and can takes this thing apart, order batteries from China, connect it back to micro-schema and hope it will work again - do not buy it.</li>
    <li> The warming affect feels so great! It is like a spa treatment and kind of relaxing. I have gotten into the habit of using it before bed. Loving it!</li>
    <li> Judging by the ratings I thought I would give it a try but it was just a huge waste of money. :-(</li>
    <li> Bought one in 2013 and the battery will not charge, rendering it as a nice-looking brick. Unfortunately, this issue seems to be one that comes up quite a bit when reading the reviews and therefore I will not recommend it. As for expectations, it warmed and reddened the skin which I&#x27;m sure had a beneficial effect but there wasn&#x27;t a noticeable change regarding smoothing or wrinkle repair. My experience is that you will get more results from nutrition, hydration, exercise, moisturizing and micro-needling. In fact, in my quest for eternal youthfulness, I would say the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made was a $40.00 micro-roller. Stay away from products that make incredible claims, or even believing reviews. That said: micro-needling.</li>
    <li> My wife was a little apprehensive about purchasing this based on some of the reviews.  However she is very pleased with this item.  It is easy to use, just follow the directions.</li>
    <li> I bought it because of the positive reviews. I know everyone&#x27;s skin responds differently, but my skin did not respond. It  was relaxing on my face but I saw no improvement. Used for 3 months daily with no improvement. On to the next search.</li>
    <li> i was unhappy with the product, it did not glide easily across my skin and it would not keep a charge</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work...don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I have been using this device for almost 2 months. Plus also Peelife microdermabrasion for 2 years and Retin-A for over 13 years. I&#x27;m not sure if there is more reduction in wrinkles and pores since using this device. I&#x27;m 44 years old but look like in the mid 30s as I was told. I think the laser at dermatogist is stronger and more effective than this handheld one. But for DIY, this device is okay. The others reviewers stated it is fantastic, I&#x27;m not sure if they are right since they psychologically believe it works. I&#x27;m in the health field and I don&#x27;t think it is effective, but it may slow down the skin aging process a bit.</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s still too early to know if this is going to have any tangible, lasting benefit, the LED device does at least give the face a nice warm massage. The science behind the product says that it stimulates an increase in collagen. While this holds true for very expensive professional treatments, this handheld device skirts the lower limits of what might be considered ineffective. Time will tell, but I&#x27;m not going to down-rate a product based on an unknown. What the device does do for certain is make your face feel good. The shape of the unit allows for a comfortable grip that is easy to control while using. If I would complain about any one thing, it would be the power cord could stand to be a little longer.</li>
    <li> This device offers consumers a way to take advantage of LED (light-emitting diode) phototherapy. Phototherapy has grown out of NASA&#x27;s (National Aeronautic and Space Administration) discovery that LED technology could deliver light deep into human body tissues to promote tissue growth and wound healing. In my efforts to research this I ran into two basic kinds of information, one highly specialized, professional, and technical, and the other consisting of what I would characterize as hype by people with a vested interest in marketing their consumer grade LED therapy products to consumers. I ignored the hype and did my best to understand the technical abstracts of papers published in professional journals, etc. And my conclusion is that a consumer grade LED therapy device such as the Silk&#x27;n does indeed have the potential to yield positive, desirable results, but only if used regularly for at least six months or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LED interact with molecules in plant and animal cells, and can stimulate tissue growth and regeneration. But this takes time and is not a miracle cure. The instruction manual that comes with this product recommends using it for 15-20 minutes a minimum of three times a week for the first month, and once a week after that. Some literature I&#x27;ve seen suggests that it may be necessary to use an LED therapy device more frequently than that in order to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handheld Silk&#x27;n unit is powered by electricity from a wall-wart, which means that it&#x27;s plugged in when you use it. I initially used it when standing in a bathroom, but then started using it when watching TV. The only drawback to using it when watching TV is dealing with the electric cord (e.g., I have to use an extension cord, and when using the device on areas of my forehead the cord falls in front of my eyes and I have to hold it out of the way). LED therapy is not a miracle cure and it would be unreasonable to expect to see results in less than a few months. Of course marketers will offer testimonials and retouched or photoshopped before and after photos to persuade prospective buyers that using this device for a few weeks will make them look ten or more years younger, etc., but that&#x27;s not empirical evidence, that&#x27;s hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend that anyone considering buying one of these consult with a dermatologist. If you have no reason to see a dermatologist, maybe you have a friend or relative who visits one and who would be willing to ask their dermatologist if he or she recommends the use of handheld, consumer grade LED therapy devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also need to consider if red light therapy or blue light therapy is best for you. Blue light therapy is said to be better for treatment of acne, while red light therapy is said to help skin maintain elasticity and firmness and may also help treat rosacea and eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device is easy to use. Use of a light oil based serum is recommended to help the surface of the device glide over the skin. I haven&#x27;t had too much trouble gliding over my skin without use of such a serum, though I see how using such a serum could help.monials and retouched or photoshopped before and after photos to persuade prospective buyers that using this device for a few weeks will make them look ten or more years younger, etc., but that&#x27;s not empirical evidence, that&#x27;s hype.

    <li> [[VIDEOID:3ed5cbdfac3c8c914f16d1374e43e44f]] Highlights of my Video Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Red Light Therapy can actually be used all over your body for all sorts of healing functions.  I found this unit to be extremely helpful in helping with issues in my face, as well as helping other things heals like a torn ligament in my wrist.  You can do more research on it, but basically, the light penetrates about 100 mm into your skin and stimulates healing for all sorts of issues.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Corded&lt;br /&gt;3.  Very powerful&lt;br /&gt;4.  Very good heat level - feels very warm, like a heating pad - extremely soothing&lt;br /&gt;5.  Use for 5-7 minutes in each area - I end up spending about 1/2 hour on my face - but I made it my evening routine. At the end of the day, after face is washed and prepped, sit down and watch some TV or read a book while running this across my face.  Really relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;6.  Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;7.  No limit to how much use you can get out of this light, unlike other similar products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - excellent product.  Especially useful since it can be used for therapy on other problems, not just on your face.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product, the battery dies and no replacement available wasted a ton of money and never was able to see if it even worked</li>
    <li> I am 36 years old and have done laser tightening in a doctors office before, so i know that there are technologies out there that work. i just don&#x27;t want to pay $2000 for them. So when i saw a groupon for this product, i went ahead and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the purchase i read some mixed reviews on the internet, so i didn&#x27;t have my hopes up. however after just one application i could tell a difference in my face, and after two, i really know if works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me say, though, that i am 36 (almost 37) with a lot of sun damage from my 20s (which i&#x27;m trying to repair!) and have a very stressful life. i could see the stress in my face, with my skin losing tone and my neck becoming slightly loose and crepe-y upon careful inspection. i knew that with lasers to activate the under-layer of my skin that it would look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure about this LED product. And while i was using it, it didn&#x27;t get too hot, so i was not hopeful. I looked in the mirror the next morning and \\&quot;thought\\&quot; i looked better, but i wasn&#x27;t sure if i was imagining it. But two days later i went to get my hair done and the hairdresser said, \\&quot;have you lost weight?\\&quot; i said no, and she said \\&quot;your face looks thinner\\&quot;. And then i knew the prouct was working. My face skin has better tone and my neck wrinkles are shrinking and the skin under my chin is tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this for 30 minutes on my face, 7-8 minutes per area (forehead/brow, left side, right side, chin/neck) and have used it for two sessions, one week apart. I feel like it took 5 years off of my face, and I won&#x27;t be running back for botox anytime soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to caution, though, that if your face is already pretty firm, or you aren&#x27;t over 33 or so, you probably won&#x27;t see results with this. I think this is made for slightly un-toned skin, which is what i have. On me, i feel the results have been dramatic, and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; update 7/12/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided that this product is a little more trouble than it&#x27;s worth. it&#x27;s hard to keep up with the treatments because they are time consuming, and the results only last a couple of days.ed that this product is a little more trouble than it&#x27;s worth. it&#x27;s hard to keep up with the treatments because they are time consuming, and the results only last a couple of days.</li>
    <li> I used this only a week or so and then it would no longer take a charge, so it is difficult to comment on whether it delivers as advertised as an anti-aging device. I returned it to the Israel seller 2 weeks ago and have not heard anything. Perhaps seller has not yet received it, but I am nervous about getting a refund as it was expensive! Also postage for the return was $20, and who knows if I will be reimbursed for that?</li>
    <li> I have used the product for just over 3 weeks now and cannot tell any difference with my pores, wrinkles or fine lines at all. It also takes a considerable amount of time to use and has to be done frequently. The manufacturer says it can take up to 8 weeks of consistent use to see a difference, and I will continue to use it to see if this is true.  I will update my review if anything changes with the results.</li>
    <li> Great Product, would recommend to all.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at Costco.  was very excited about the possibilities since i had read about red light therapy.  I used it 4 times and it felt wonderful and did look lie it had some effect. On the 5th time, the red lights did not go on only the heating element.  I figured it was a charge needed and put it on the charger overnight.  The next morning, it still didn&#x27;t work.  I called the company and left a message.  Waited nearly a week for a return call, left message again.  A week later I returned it.  The one thing that was good about this was my discovery of squalane!  what and incredible moisturizing oil! it gets one star because i wasn&#x27;t able to judge the effect AND the company response was non existent.</li>
    <li> need to buy another one after i told my friend that it also works great on my aching feet. light therapy really works. not only for wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I had this device for eleven months and it would not hold a charge.  It was still under warranty. I got in touch with customer service and was sent a new one in about two weeks.  I had this one for about eight  month and it also wouldn&#x27;t  hold a charge.  Once again customer service in Euclid Ca.. The very nice rep explained that to prevent the problem was to fully discharge FaceFx device, use it discharge fully, use it, discharge.  Coincidentally UPS man delivered new FaceFx today.  Did not even wait two weeks this time.  The rep said to call her (can&#x27;t remember her name) with the tracking number when I got it and this way the process would be expediated.&lt;br /&gt;As to the device, I love what it has done to my face, diminished wrinkles, smooth skin, clear and bright result.  I highly recommend buying a Clairisonic for really great results.</li>
    <li> Like others, I followed what to do so the device would not lose a charge. NO LUCK! USELESS ITEM! DON&amp;#34;T BUY!</li>
    <li> igot my package  with  empty space  im missing something I don&#x27;t know what is it</li>
    <li> company does not stand for their product. I have this face fx replacement after the first and again it did not last long time; charger and or hand piece were faulty. Again this one does not work anymore ; light will only last few seconds and goes out. They offer me to buy another face fx since this second one quit for half price but they won&#x27;t give me a full year warranty ; they are only willing to give me 30 days warranty which shows they do not stand by their product. They do not have good customer service. I was willing to buy extended warranty but customer service rep on phone says they are not offered!!! I hate that kind of customer service; I advise you not to  buy ;product does not hold up long enough to see results!</li>
    <li> I had originally written a very positive review a year ago (it&#x27;s now December 24, 2013) and said I would report back later. Well, I am now 50 years old and am still looking for that Fountain of Youth, because it&#x27;s not this product.[[ASIN:B0077R67CE Silk&#x27;n SN-001 FaceFx Anti-Aging LED Handheld Facial Device]] What I have found is that for awhile after using it, my face actually looks worse and I have to really moisturize for it to look okay. This product did not get rid of my wrinkles, nor did it help my sagging skin. After a few months of frustration, I went to my dermatologist and started getting e-matrix treatments, which do help, although I still have wrinkles. Maybe there is no Fountain of Youth outside of a facelift, which I refuse to get. When I look at pictures from a year ago, there is improvement, but it&#x27;s the e-matrix, not this product. Maybe if you get started with it younger than I did it would help, but it really did nothing for me, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about 2 weeks, so hardly have been using it &amp;#34;long term.&amp;#34;  That said, I haven&#x27;t seen any reduction in fine lines.  The only reason I&#x27;m rating it 3 stars is that I have noticed an improvement in the texture of my skin.  It wasn&#x27;t bad before, but it&#x27;s baby smooth now.  I&#x27;ll keep using and update if the lines start to magically disappear!</li>
    <li> I live my Face FX! Within 2 weeks my 35 year old daughter said &amp;#34;what have you done? Did you do something to your hair? No it&#x27;s your face mom! What have you done to your face look how nice your skin abd your pores, they&#x27;re so tight and they&#x27;re smaller than mine!&lt;br /&gt;I love what face FX has done to my face I love the feeling of doing my routine now at least once a day sometimes twice if I have time in the evening. it has reduced the wrinkles on my face tightened my pores I feel younger when I look in the mirror now I&#x27;m 58 and I&#x27;m really happy and will keep on using this product love the cream and oil also that go with it&lt;br /&gt;Cathy, Midland Ontario</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference with this product. I also use it on my husband and the loves it because the line he had on his forehead and nose has disappear. I will recommend and I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical but after using it a few times I can clearly see the improvements.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I bought this, but decided it was worth a try.  I have been using it for several weeks, about every other night while watching TV.  I have seen wrinkles decrease in depth and saggy jowls get tighter.  I&#x27;m really glad I took a chance on this, I&#x27;m a believer now.</li>
    <li> I would give this a 5 but I did not personally use it. My mom said she loves it and definitely sees a difference with the line on her forehead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m SO glad I broke down and purchased this device! I was reluctant to buy it because I already have 2 devices that make the same claims! I have seen REAL improvements using FaceFx. I used it more than 3 times a week though. I used it almost every day for a month and my upper eyelid DID lift and NOTICEABLY so! After close to 2 months of use now my forehead wrinkles are not nearly as deep and my skin seems to be tightening too. People who haven&#x27;t seem me in a few months told me I look good, that they could tell a difference and asked me what I was doing! I love that I don&#x27;t have to use it EVERY day now that my eyelid is lifted I really only seem to need to use it every 2 days and I have to admit I also have the Facemaster and the Dermawand and neither of those products lift my upper eyelid for more than an hour or two, frustrating! I use the Facemaster for the hollow under the eye (have the best results with it for the hollowing) and the Dermawand on my parentheses lines that are starting around my mouth, the DW on my age spots and the DW on my pores. I am the most thrilled with the FaceFx though as keeping my upper eyelid lifted really is important to me and the sagging that starts around the jaw is also an area that is top priority for me. I have read reviews where people say the FaceFx dies after a couple of months &#x3D;/ I&#x27;ve been making sure the device is cooled down before I charge it and I try to only leave it on the charge station until its charged, then I unplug the charge station (I don&#x27;t keep the charge station plugged into the wall). I don&#x27;t know if that will help extend the life of the product or not but I SURE hope so because I LOVE it.</li>
    <li> It works! And my face is glowing! So far it&#x27;s been working well and I can see the decrease in my wrinkles. It&#x27;s also painless and easy to use. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using this unit for two months, and I do not see any difference on my face. Actually the loose skin in my neck seems to be a little worse. I used it on my hands too and there is no difference also.</li>
    <li> This really works. Look 10 + years younger.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> Foi um presente solicitado porque recomendado por esteticista para minha esposa. Est&amp;aacute; muito satisfeita com os resultados. Produto chegou em perfeitas condições antes do prazo marcado. Excelente.</li>
