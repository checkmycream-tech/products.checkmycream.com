      <li>But very good hair product</li>
      <li>Before buying this product I had used a lot of the Sleek Look line and LOVED IT!  </li>

      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>This stuff USED to be amazing.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast, product arrived in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was so thrilled to find this product again.</li>
      <li>I refuse to take that kind of chance with my hair again.</li>
      <li>This arrived really fast, and it&#x27;s a great product.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>It was not at my hair salon any more.</li>
      <li>Great product  works very good on my thick hair .</li>
      <li>Nice, smooth, straight hair each and every time!  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!!!!</li>
      <li>Also, the price is right on amazon!</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great product especially for use in hot humid weather.  </li>
      <li>It seemed good when I applied it to damp hair and proceeded to blow dry my hair.</li>
      <li>Once I&#x27;ve parted my hair when wet, I put a fair amount of this into my hands, rub together, and then scrunch/curl.  </li>
      <li>Works great for helping to tame the curls in my hair.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair beautiful and does not leave it feeling brittle or hard.  </li>
      <li>I never understand why these companies will hit upon a line that really works, then do away with it just to bring out something &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>What is nice about these products is you don&#x27;t have to use much which makes it last a long time.</li>
      <li>OK, so unlike a lot of recent reviews, this does not dry out my hair.</li>
      <li>Alternatively, I will rub it through my hair (just a light amount), blow dry it, and then straighten it.  </li>
      <li>The main way I use it is to make my hair curly.  </li>
      <li>Does well in my hair make it real soft.</li>
      <li>It helps to manage some of the frizz and wave just fine, though not as well as other products I have tried.</li>
      <li>It works so well on my hair and makes it so soft.  </li>
      <li>My hair is still natural.  </li>
      <li>I believe that it how it was meant to be used, but I have discovered away to enhance my natural curls</li>
      <li>I enjoyed it at first, but eventually my hair became dry and looked dull.</li>
      <li>I used to swear by this stuff - it used to make my hair so soft and shiny after using my blow dryer and flat iron (on naturally curly hair, mind you) -</li>
      <li>However, apparently when Matrix changed the packaging, they also changed the formula.</li>
      <li>I use it before I blow dry and flat iron my hair, and it leaves my hair really soft!</li>

<li> Hair ended up all dry and shineless.</li>
<li> but now it just makes it dry and brittle.</li>
<li> But a half hour later my skull became very itchy and uncomfortable.  </li>
<li> Product has become hard to find in recent years.</li>
<li> At first I thought my hair was going to crap for other reasons, but then realized it was due to the blow down lotion.</li>
<li> Not only is it awful, but it is a unique kind of awful that is hard to describe.</li>
<li> Hopefully Matrix won&#x27;t go changing a bunch of other products, I&#x27;d hate to swear off the whole brand.</li>
<li> If you have thick, wavy hair would &#x27;t recomend.</li>
<li> If you go to Matrix&#x27;s company website, you&#x27;ll see several complaints registered there, too, for the bad change in formula.</li>
<li> Unfortunately this product did not work for me.</li>
<li> Was running out of the product and unable to find in the stores.  </li>
<li> Tried 3 times but results were awful.  </li>

    <li> A wonderful line of hair products.  I never understand why these companies will hit upon a line that really works, then do away with it just to bring out something &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34;.  Makes no sense.</li>
    <li> Product has become hard to find in recent years. But very good hair product</li>
    <li> Great price. Great product!</li>
    <li> I used this product after Garnier Fructis anti-Humidity styling gel was discontinued. It seemed good when I applied it to damp hair and proceeded to blow dry my hair. But a half hour later my skull became very itchy and uncomfortable.  Unfortunately this product did not work for me.</li>
    <li> OK, so unlike a lot of recent reviews, this does not dry out my hair. It helps to manage some of the frizz and wave just fine, though not as well as other products I have tried. Which is why I have given it two stars, instead of one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What bothers me is the smell. Not only is it awful, but it is a unique kind of awful that is hard to describe. It will make your head smell like it is made of burning plastic. Truly revolting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip this one, ladies. Just..skip it.</li>
    <li> This arrived really fast, and it&#x27;s a great product.  I use it before I blow dry and flat iron my hair, and it leaves my hair really soft!</li>
    <li> This stuff USED to be amazing. However, apparently when Matrix changed the packaging, they also changed the formula. At first I thought my hair was going to crap for other reasons, but then realized it was due to the blow down lotion. If you go to Matrix&#x27;s company website, you&#x27;ll see several complaints registered there, too, for the bad change in formula. I used to swear by this stuff - it used to make my hair so soft and shiny after using my blow dryer and flat iron (on naturally curly hair, mind you) - but now it just makes it dry and brittle. I wish I&#x27;d realized it was this product doing the damage to my hair before I&#x27;d thrown out the receipt, but I&#x27;m brand-loyal and didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d have any issues. However, I will not be buying this stuff again EVER. I refuse to take that kind of chance with my hair again. Hopefully Matrix won&#x27;t go changing a bunch of other products, I&#x27;d hate to swear off the whole brand.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I use it one of two ways.  The main way I use it is to make my hair curly.  Once I&#x27;ve parted my hair when wet, I put a fair amount of this into my hands, rub together, and then scrunch/curl.  It makes my hair beautiful and does not leave it feeling brittle or hard.  My hair is still natural.  Alternatively, I will rub it through my hair (just a light amount), blow dry it, and then straighten it.  I believe that it how it was meant to be used, but I have discovered away to enhance my natural curls and I love it!</li>
    <li> Used it!~ and its nice!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  It works so well on my hair and makes it so soft.  Also, the price is right on amazon!</li>
    <li> Great product  works very good on my thick hair .</li>
    <li> I was so thrilled to find this product again. It was not at my hair salon any more. I love this product.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, product arrived in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product especially for use in hot humid weather.  It also works well in damp weather.  Nice, smooth, straight hair each and every time!  I highly recommend the Matrix Sleek Look Blow Down Extreme Creme and the Matrix shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Best perfect for curly hair , even beats Florida&#x27;s humidity !!</li>
    <li> Does well in my hair make it real soft.</li>
    <li> Hair ended up all dry and shineless. Tried 3 times but results were awful.  If you have thick, wavy hair would &#x27;t recomend.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Matrix line since March and I must say these products are amazing! I put it on my hair after I shower and before styling it. My hair is the healthiest it has ever been. In addtion to this I would recomend their shampoo and conditioner as well. What is nice about these products is you don&#x27;t have to use much which makes it last a long time. This bottle lasted me over four months.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed it at first, but eventually my hair became dry and looked dull. I do not recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> Was running out of the product and unable to find in the stores.  Very happy to have it again....... It works wnderfully for controlling my frizzy curls and helps when flat ironing too!</li>
    <li> Before buying this product I had used a lot of the Sleek Look line and LOVED IT!  This creme definately works as well as the rest of the product line!  Highly recommended!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great for helping to tame the curls in my hair.</li>
