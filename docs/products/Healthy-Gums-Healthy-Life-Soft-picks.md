<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you have not tried these you should.  My whole family likes them.  My dentist first gave me a few.  They are much better that a wood toothpic.</li>
    <li> I love these guys.  I do a lot of grinding and have sharp spots on my teeth that cut floss, so flossing takes forever,  These I use twice a day, no problem.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t leave the house without these.  The travel cases make having them with you effortless.</li>
    <li> Better than toothpicks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the picks, and this one is the best for my money. This seller had the best price I found.</li>
    <li> A great, gentle and easy way to keep gums &amp; teeth clean.&lt;br /&gt;Especially good to use them if you don&#x27;t floss often; they work almost as well.&lt;br /&gt;I always have some in my purse with me.</li>
    <li> They were too flimsy.  One fell apart from only moderate flossing.</li>
    <li> These little guys are addicting!  From someone who does not like to floss, these are a perfect replacement on the go, or whenever!</li>
    <li> I use these in addition to flossing. These picks are soft &amp; cushy and flexible to reach just where you need them too. They are great for getting behind bridges and easier to use than floss threaders. They also help with any areas of gum recession to get further up near the root than floss alone can go.</li>
    <li> These soft-picks have come into their own as a useful way to get those stubborn items between the teeth and to help maintain dental hygiene. This order provided a 1-2 year supply for me. I do not advise using each pick for more than one cleaning.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing and stumbled on these.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what my hygenist (sp) has to say in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep these in the car and much easier to use since you don&#x27;t have to use both hands like with floss.  I&#x27;m sure my fellow road warrriors appreciate it since I now don&#x27;t have to steer with my knees.</li>
    <li> I have tried all the types out there and this one works best for me, the soft bristles enable a thorough cleaning without tearing the tissue.  My teeth are very close together and I can still manipulate this pick. Best one on the market on my opinion.</li>
    <li> It really massage my gum. Love it.</li>
    <li> These are great.  I love the soft feel of them and they are so effective.  Perfect for anyone, even if someone has very sensitive gums.</li>
    <li> My husband and I use them everyday.  I have had gum disease and these have been helpful to keep me healthy.</li>
    <li> i like how they work.  They do a fine job.</li>
    <li> I wish more fit in the little case, but otherwise these are a great product. They clean out stuff dental floss leaves behind.</li>
    <li> The green ones (Pictured) are great. New ones are Pink, and are far more flimsy. I can&#x27;t find the green ones anywhere.</li>
    <li> Great for everyday use and also great for travel.  Soft and Comfortable and washable/reusable.  Great value.</li>
    <li> These things are great! You can honestly reuse each one a few times, so they go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars, but the product I got wasn&#x27;t exactly as pictured: mine was plastered with Susan B. Komen marketing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not happy that I was tricked into financially aiding that grasping, covetous slag. Not cool.</li>
    <li> fabulous! simply fabulous!!</li>
    <li> works great. gets between teeth easily. soft gentle way to get food from between teeth. down side is they&#x27;re kind of expensive.</li>
    <li> If you were fortunate enough to get a PERMANENT retainer after needing braces (Permanent as in indefinite. As in you will die with that retainer), you&#x27;re quality of life can finally someone increase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more earfuls from the dentist about how your front teeth are going to rot out of your face in five years because you don&#x27;t want to sew plaque out of your gums. These are much more efficient and convenient to use. Too bad at the end of the day, you still have a retainer.</li>
    <li> Love this ...with to go cases.perfect&lt;br /&gt;Works great with braces</li>
    <li> If the manufacturer had put some thought into keeping these clean/sterile, I would rate the picks themselves as 5 stars.  Unfortunately, the packaging is the worst imaginable - once you open the package, there is no way of keeping all of the soft-picks clean/sterile - as they are not in any kind of container.  I temporarily resolved this, by placing them in a plastic zippable bag.  The &amp;#34;travel cases&amp;#34; are so small, that they only have room for a few of the picks.  The picks work great and the product recommended by my dentist - but the packaging is almost the worst imaginable.</li>
    <li> i use them all the time</li>
    <li> Best thing for people liked me that to really take care of my teeth. It especially great for hard to get to places. I had a deep pocket at the back of one of my front tooth and the dentist was really concerned about. After using this product for a few months, I had a cleaning and the hygienist did not believe how much better it was. After another few months, she said it has gotten to such a level that I did not have to use the soft picks there any more. I am not using it on another problem area that is really hard to get to and I can feel that it is getting better. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I used GUM soft picks once when my dentist gave them to me as a sample. I really liked them! Recently I had a dental problem and couldn&#x27;t really floss between my teeth. I use a different GUM product (Which Is Very Good) but, I recalled these soft GUM Picks. Saw them on Amazon and got them. If you haven&#x27;t tried them before, you&#x27;ll find out they are better then regular flossing.</li>
    <li> Good price! However, they bend easily.</li>
    <li> These are a must if yu want to get in between your teeth and around your gums.  Most economical, too.</li>
    <li> I use these picks multiple times on a daily basis. These are by far the best ones out there for wider gaps in the teeth.</li>
    <li> If you have tight teeth and difficult to floss, this is the only product that has worked for me.</li>
    <li> These are great. I also use flossers and listerine. If I had to go with just one, it would be the soft picks. They&#x27;re so convenient and easier, less of a pain than flossing. But using all three last time got me in good my my dental hygienist. I just use it once a day in the morning as part of my AM regime after brushing. I usually just floss in the evening but not as regularly as I should. I don&#x27;t eat junk food and few sweets. It all works together. Good teeth are part of good health and appearance and easier on your pocketbook. Also lost teeth make your face sag.</li>
    <li> Great product and good price!</li>
    <li> USE THESE BRUSHES EVERY DAY..</li>
    <li> I bought these elsewhere, will order here in the future.  They are the best thing ever, amazing. They get in between any teeth, under bridge work, and they feel good on your gums and never make them bleed.  I am addicted to them.  I use in addition to brushing and flossing and feel squeeky clean.  They are a must  have!!</li>
    <li> This item was recommended by the Hygenist in my dentist&#x27;s office.  The 240 pick pack is a good value compared to the smaller packs sold in most stores.  It comes with 3 handy plastic packs that can be carried with you or easily packed while traveling.</li>
    <li> My dentist gave me a sample of these soft-picks and now, I use them all the time.  They fit between bridges, they don&#x27;t hurt gums and they do a great job.</li>
    <li> I never even knew these existed, but my teeth are very tightly spaced and I can shred almost any type of floss trying to clean my teeth.  These fit down by the gum line.  I still use floss at night, but I use these in the morning instead.  You keep threading them in and out until you hear the rubber squeak, then you know any film is off your teeth!</li>
    <li> I find flossing uncomfortable but I know it&#x27;s necessary. I tried the floss on the plastic loop handle, but I like Soft-picks more. They&#x27;re easy to use and really get between your teeth at the gum line. An excellent product.</li>
    <li> I already reviewed this product and said that it&#x27;s an amazing value for the price and the product itself is great quality-price combination. If you use soft-picks, you should get this set, as it&#x27;s the best price for the amount you are getting. I even think I will buy more, even though I am set for at least few months. I love it!</li>
    <li> My husband and I like these because they are softer than hard plastic toothpicks.  It&#x27;s more economical to purchase a larger quantity from Amazon than from the drug store.</li>
    <li> these things are just OK.  The shaft is too flexible to allow the pick to be easily pushed between my teeth and are not that effective at removing food.  My waterpik, floss, and a stainless steel pick work a lot better.</li>
    <li> Since I started with these, my hygienist always remarks about how much healthier my gums are. Use these in addition to floss and you&#x27;ll notice quite a difference. These get what floss doesn&#x27;t and vice versa, and they massage your gums.</li>
    <li> They do not pick as much as wanted.</li>
    <li> These are so much easier to use than dental floss, and so much easier on the gums than those plastic brush picks. My dentist recommended these and I love them!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist office.  Does a super good job at cleaning if you use them from the front and back of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There ARE 240 picks, 3 packs of 80.  Costco is selling the identical package for $9.99</li>
    <li> Soft but very good at removing food from between teeth.  Does not, however, clean where teeth are actually touching.  Still need floss for areas where teeth touch.  I really like them as the first thing I use when cleaning my teeth.  Very comfortable.  :-Donna</li>
    <li> i have been using these for years.  they do not replace floss but they do toothpicks.  i had them sent to my grandmother and she is not hocked on them as well.</li>
    <li> I had braces as a kid.  My dentist recommended I use these on occasion because regular floss is too small for the spaces between the teeth left by braces.</li>
    <li> Love these little gems!!</li>
    <li> came fast, mom loves it</li>
    <li> Soft picks are the only way next to flossing to clean between teeth.  Much safer than wooden toothpicks</li>
    <li> A friend gave me these to try and said she likes them better than floss. I totally agree! Got this for me and my husband.  This will replace his threader floss.  Great to put in my purse for touch ups after lunch at work. MUCH neater than floss.</li>
    <li> I love these, they work very good and are soft. I have braces so they get in between the wires nicely.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommend these picks. They have made a big difference in just a few days with my gums. I have arthritis and flossing is a bit difficult but with these picks it so much easier. They are suppose to be soft and you are not suppose to use a lot of pressure. For teeth that are very tight, don&#x27;t force the pick on those teeth use your dental floss.  They will keep the plaque from building up on your teeth and they keep the gums healthy by massaging them.</li>
    <li> Great picks-great price</li>
    <li> These are essential for good dental hygiene.  The product does bend easily which sometimes requires one use several per operation.</li>
    <li> Love these, best price around!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy the small packs at Target or Walmart!&lt;br /&gt;I love the extra storage cases they give you as well.&lt;br /&gt;I keep cases around the house, in my purse and car.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best I have ever found for the purpose. Soft but firm enough to clean between teeth. It feels like you brush the gaps with a nice, soft toothbrush. Easy to carry around in tiny cases. Dollar stores sell them in individual packs and cheaper if you don&#x27;t want to buy a bunch on Amazon. I gave a huge pack to my brother and he loves it too.</li>
    <li> I am not sure who likes to floss...it is awkward and sometimes hard to get to the right places. With the soft-picks after a few miss-fires it is really easy to get the job done and keep your gums clean even if your teeth are all crooked.</li>
    <li> Excellent price,  greattach massage to gums</li>
    <li> I love these things.  I carry them in my purse so i can use them after every meal and times inbetween if I eat something</li>
    <li> ... seventy years from now.  These soft-picks are so addictive.  I don&#x27;t feel right unless and until I use one after meals.</li>
    <li> Not pleased - would not buy again.  Too flexible/flimsy.  Cannot even complete one teeth cleaning per pick.</li>
    <li> Green picks were pictured which were the type I used previously. Received the pink. They are not as good.</li>
    <li> This is a great item for those who have braces or a permanent bottom retainer. Thanks to these babies you will not have to feel guilty when you get your teeth cleaned at the dentist.</li>
    <li> My dentist loves the results.</li>
    <li> I think they are great.  Actually purchased them for a home that our church adopted.  They needed the picks, tooth brushes, soap, combs, etc., etc.  They were well received when the church delivered the items they needed.</li>
    <li> as described - a lot more flimsythan the bigger size ones - I will only be getting the larger ones from now on - Gum Soft-picks With Wider Spaces Size: 80</li>
    <li> Mom uses them all the time - good for going on 90</li>
    <li> Great, especially when case is provided for your purse.  Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> My new dentist recommended these and I really like them. They are the next to last step in my dental regimen now, right before the final Listerinō.</li>
    <li> great for your oral health</li>
    <li> Love these they work great!</li>
    <li> I have been using these G-U-M Soft Picks for about 6 months now. They feel really good against the gums, not as abrasive and hurtful as some other picks out there. I&#x27;ve tried many others including Stim-U-Dent and the ever popular Doctor&#x27;s Brush Picks which are also available on Amazon. I found those to be very stiff and hard against my gums and they felt like you could literally do some damage if used incorrectly. These by comparison feel better, but also seem to do the job better as well. I have both small tight gaps as well as larger gaps between my teeth. These work well in all of them. I particularly like the way they work in-between the back molars. I sometimes will floss and then use the soft pick and am still able to get out other small particles of food. I find that you will need two of them to finish the job in the mouth. One for the upper teeth and one for the lower teeth. What happens is that sometimes when you are using them in the back molars, the tip will bend and once that happens it is hard to use it anymore, so I always start with the front teeth and then move towards the back. I&#x27;ve noticed that because these actually have tiny little rubber brushes on them, that my gums feel squeaky clean after using them, much cleaner than if I&#x27;d just used floss. As they say, the proof is in the pudding: My last visit to the hygienist was the best I&#x27;ve ever had. She wanted to know what I had been doing as the deep pockets in my gums had significantly improved. About 5 years ago I had to go through the painful process of a deep cleaning where they have to numb a quarter of your mouth at a time so that they can clean below the gum line in an attempt to help improve the size of the pockets in the gums surrounding the teeth. This is a laborious process that took four visits to the dentist. Trust me, it&#x27;s better to not have to get to the point where this is needed! The improvement from the deep cleaning was good, but not nearly as good and as easy as the improvement that was quickly achieved through my using these Soft Picks.</li>
    <li> Buying these little fellas in large quantity makes using them easy, as I don&#x27;t find myself running out.  A lot easier than flossing, and less messy.  I think it does a better job, too.</li>
    <li> Other than needing reading glasses, the worst thing about aging is the need for toothpicks!  These are perfect in every way.  They are so soft they get easily into any crevice and the little &amp;#34;feathers&amp;#34; pull/push the food right out.  I have tried almost every product on the market and these are so far superior to anything else.  I carry them everywhere and have give them as gifts to friends/family who are so grateful to have been introduced to such a great product.  Happy smiling with clean teeth!</li>
    <li> I am so glad to have found this product. My dental hygienist recommended them to me.  I have had a problem with food between my teeth and the soft picks have become part of my nightly routine.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing, and after some research and frustration from my dentist, I purchased these. I have been using them every day for six months, and my gums have never felt better. It takes about three-to-five picks (depending how rushed you are), as they bend with the right amount of force, but I love them.</li>
    <li> Better than toothpicks!  As a former dental assistant I live off these things.  They are great for people with food traps and &amp;#34;gaps&amp;#34; between teeth.  They stimulate gums and reduce inflammation, while reducing plaque around teeth.  I have them in their little plastic container in my purse and the car.  They hold about 15-20 at a time!</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s dentist gave him some samples of these to try.  He thinks they work really well so I purchased these for him.  Very pleased with the delivery time, also.</li>
    <li> I am American and raised on wood tooth picks. I will say that these are far superior than wood picks. My dentist agrees, and with Amazon pricing and service I don&#x27;t think twice about using anything else.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended using the GUM brand picks to help keep my gums healthy.  I know the dentist wants me to floss every day, but I only seem to manage a couple of times a week.  I keep these pick handy so I find that I&#x27;m using them several times a day.  They are easy to use between the teeth.  I dispose of them after each use so the cost of buying them in a 240 pack is a pretty inexpensive way of keeping your gums and teeth healthy.</li>
    <li> The soft-picks can be difficult to find in my drug store, so I placed this order that I&#x27;m sure will keep me stocked for a long time. I like the fact that they are enclosed in the small plastic travel cases which hold the soft-picks secure yet are not awkward to open. If the spaces to clean between the teeth can easily use dental floss, you should not have problem using them.</li>
    <li> This product replaces a toothpick.  The pick end is pointed and gets larger closer to the &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; with little projections along the sides.  This is the soft part you pick your teeth with so it can really get between teeth.  The handle end is flat for a good grip but the whole device is small you can fit lots of them in a thin, clear carrying case that easily fits in your pocket.  We keep these all over the house and in the car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A standard wooden tooth pick is much larger and harder.  Those individual dental floss gadgets break too easily and are bulky to use discretely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only disadvantage is that sometimes the tip bends and then can&#x27;t be used efficiently.</li>
    <li> Best deal compared to large retail stores. These work so well, I use after I floss and get a lot more debris out. I will only buy from amazon, bottom line the savings are worth it!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without these!</li>
    <li> Great product, wrong value. You may want to look around. Let&#x27;s see if Amazon censors catch me this time.</li>
    <li> great replacement for toothpicks and stim-u-dents. Much more comfortable to use than floss and more effective.</li>
    <li> GUM Soft-Picks re the best dental care picks I have ever used.  I use them with mouthwash every night before I go to bed and my mouth is cleaner and my breath is fresher than it has ever been. I found a great price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Use these a lot. Nice to have a supply on hand.</li>
    <li> Soooo much easier to use than toothpicks!!!!  Even works well with tightly crowded teeth, bridges, etc!</li>
    <li> too soft.  Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s and I have never been able to get into a habit of flossing. These aren&#x27;t as effective as flossing but they&#x27;re the next best thing and I find myself using them at least twice a day. The only negative I have to offer is the price. After I ordered I found them at my local Costco for significantly cheaper.</li>
    <li> These little picks are terrific. I started using these things about five years ago and now my entire family uses them. They do a very nice job of massaging the gums as well as cleaning between the teeth.</li>
    <li> Could be a little stiffer</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner and was what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I recently invested a great deal of money into dental work, including an implant and a couple of crowns. My dentist recommended using these between at home cleaning to be sure food particles aren&#x27;t allowed to lodge in space between teeth at gum line.</li>
    <li> love these picks. they are soft and gets the food out of teeth at the same time helps the gums</li>
    <li> We use soft picks and the brush picks several times a day to keep the dentist away.  This is a good value pack.</li>
    <li> For many years I always got cavities between my teeth. I flossed often, but not enough. These little guys made it easier though. I keep them in my makeup bag so I can use one at any time. They work like a charm!</li>
    <li> Great product! Great Seller!</li>
    <li> I love these picks!  Use them every night.  I use them in addition to floss, to help get any extra chunks out from between my teeth as well as massage the gums.  The value pack is worth it.</li>
    <li> like these the best of all picks that I have tried and my dentist recommended them. the little travel cases are nice too.</li>
    <li> These are perfect. A little stronger, perhaps, than the pink-tipped soft-picks that have more of the gum massaging rubber, but these green-tipped picks do the job just as well and are possibly the better choice for people with tightly packed teeth or bridges, as the hard plastic tips that the green rubber is wrapped around is a slightly thicker and stronger, so the tips don&#x27;t bend as easily as the pink-tipped picks which have a thinner plastic base to accommodate more of the gum-massaging rubber ridges. I liked the pink ones for gum massaging under my bridges, but I prefer the green ones more for their durability, and ability to reach more places while still providing enough soft rubber ridges to keep my gums from getting irritated.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist.  Love it!  Great product, service and price.  Love Amazon!</li>
    <li> Received as described</li>
    <li> I use these brush picks in place of flossing. I do like these brush picks, but they bend quickly so you end up having to use several picks to get the job done. I think I will try another brand next time.</li>
    <li> Good value. They do what they&#x27;re supposed to do. The bristle portion that goes between your teeth is not completely rigid, so it doesn&#x27;t hurt and won&#x27;t damage your gums if used properly. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely addicted to my soft picks.  The travel cases make them accessible anywhere. Using these as an addition to dental floss has made a huge difference in my dental checkups.  I highly recommend them to everyone.</li>
    <li> These are perfect - clear all the spaces between the teeth - use &amp; throw away, no germs laying around - Good to use picks before brushing</li>
    <li> Very good product by GUM - I bought this for my wife. I can tell my wife is is very happy with the product as well. GUM products are of the highest quality always. Highly recommended. Cheers!</li>
    <li> CAN GO DEEP LIKE WHAT I EXPECT , LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Use them every day and my hygienist says my home care is great. The travel cases are useful too.</li>
    <li> These are great to have and be able to carry around in the pocket</li>
    <li> Like these, easy to use any neat little carriers for purse.</li>
    <li> Wish I discovered this 2 years ago when I first had my braces on.  Easy way to floss.</li>
    <li> So, unlike my wife (who has perfectly aligned teeth), I have the occasional spot where my teeth are wider apart and where floss felt loose.  These rubbery little picks are great for those spots, plus they get both teeth at the same time.  This can&#x27;t replace floss because it is too big to go between the sides of the teeth, only the joint at the gumline.  They have improved my gum health as evidenced by tightening gums over my dental exams.</li>
    <li> I try to take good care of my teeth, but as I age they are tending to decay more than I would like them to.  I was getting cavities at an alarming rate, and one was so deep that my dentist considered pulling the tooth.  He expressed concern that I was getting too much tooth decay.  Even though I brushed and flossed every day, my teeth were degenerating.  Then, I found these Soft-Picks about a year ago and have been using them faithfully to clean between my teeth and massage my gums to keep them healthy and strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I missed my last teeth cleaning appointment and so when I went to have my teeth cleaned last week, it had been a year since I have seen my dentist.  The dental hygenist commented on how clean my teeth were and exclaimed that there wasn&#x27;t much for her to do.  The X-Rays showed no cavities, and when my dentist came in to examine my teeth he said that I had successfully stopped the degeneration of my teeth!  Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these little picks are a major part of the reason my dental health has improved.  I wish I had these all my life!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Not much to say about the product itself other than my dentist recommended them and they work.  Much better than wooden tooth picks and easier to carry in these cases.  The important thing is this is an excellent deal and the seller was quick shipping it.</li>
    <li> Love these!!  To me, it&#x27;s easier than flossing.  But my husband prefers flossing over using these as he says it is difficult to get them between his teeth.</li>
    <li> works great and easy to carry along</li>
    <li> These are great!  I have hated using floss since time immemorial so, of course, I don&#x27;t.  However, my oral hygienist has convinced me that I really need to and, after looking at the visual evidence, I now concur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She gave me a small package of these things and, as is the intent of these sample packages, I found I loved using them and bought the larger packages.  This one is pretty much the best deal I&#x27;ve found and I like having the extra travel case (for the Dopp Kit, at work, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like flossing you might like these.  I look forward to using them as they make my mouth feel quite clean.  Plus I like playing the find-the-food game each time as I poke these picks in between my teeth and see if there are any surprises awaiting me...</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> For those who like to use the proxy brush you will love these.  They are not harsh on your gums and do not have anything pointy or prickly that will scratch your gums or cause trauma.  They glide in between teeth easy and pain free.  I love them.</li>
    <li> Just had dentist visit - they said my gums are much better than they used to be (been going there for years).  They asked me if I was doing anything differently.  I said I&#x27;ve been using these soft picks for a few months.  They agreed - people who are using these have healthier gums.  Great product!</li>
    <li> recommended by hygeniest for &#x27;not the most consistent flossers out there&amp;#34; and yup, these will get you flossin&#x27; more.  easy to use, especially if you have really tight spaces between teeth.  and this is really good price, even cheaper than super discounter in my town.  carry case really handy for no-excuse on-the-go uses</li>
    <li> these are great to keep in my purse or for those busy mornings when i dont have time to floss very well.</li>
    <li> Great product. Clean very well.</li>
    <li> I use these every day.</li>
    <li> I have been using these soft tooth picks for several years.  My dental hygienist has also recommended them.  I hate flossing and these soft picks work very well, and I don&#x27;t want to be without them.  I have recommended these to family and friends.</li>
    <li> My teeth are very close together. Regular dental floss just shreds when I try to use it. The Kevlar kind does better but these things are the best. Admittedly they don&#x27;t cover the area where each tooth touches its neighbor, so I do still floss occasionally. These items, I keep everywhere - at home, at work, in the car. I recently asked my dentist about them and he loves them too.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Much better than floss.</li>
    <li> I just love these picks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad the dentist office recommended them to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are the greatest thing since slice wheat bread.  Smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know how I lived this long without out them.  Great for partials, massaging the gums and flossing hard to reach area.  Better than a water pik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and these were received on time and as advertised in presentation and in good condition.</li>
    <li> I really like the concept of these little tiny brush like toothpicks. However, they get soft to0 quickly. Could be better!</li>
    <li> These are so much easier than floss for me.  At least I use them.</li>
    <li> Been using these in the morning after brushing my teeth, in place of flossing. Only issue is that sometimes one will be hard to get between teeth, and if it bends, then it becomes hard to continue using it. Not sure how well these are cleaning compared to floss. I go to my dentist at the end of the month, so we&#x27;ll see what she says.</li>
    <li> Great for home and travel. Does the job.</li>
    <li> These are great for cleaning between your teeth.  The rubberized tip makes it very easy and pain free.  Try them, you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
    <li> my dentist swears by these things.  I like them too but sometimes they bend into an unusable shape.  Overall, a great product.</li>
    <li> Soft picks are soft picks, Prompt shipping.</li>
    <li> They are GREAT at cleaning between teeth at the gum line. Not sure if they can develop one that also can be pulled through your teeth down or upward to get the whole space between teeth. But the important part of cleaning is at the gum line.</li>
    <li> I like them so much that I introduced them to my daughter. Now, she loves them. I&#x27;ll share these with her as I just bought some, recently.</li>
    <li> These are not what I expected, maybe I bought the wrong ones? The dental hygienist told me to buy the green ones. The ones I bought in the store were sturdier than these. These bend too easily.</li>
    <li> These picks work really well for getting under a permanent retainer after having braces. The only downside is that they can break pretty easily, but since they are only used once it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
    <li> Very good product. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I wish the post was a tad stronger for pushing out food spec t&#x27;s between my molars.</li>
    <li> Soft-picks are wonderful for people like me who have many crowns &amp; implants. It&#x27;s difficult to get floss through the tight space between crowns. The Soft-pick enables me to clean between my teeth and at the gum itself without having to mess with floss threaders each time I brush my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s almost impossible to find Soft-picks on the shelf so the find at Amazon was a real find. I recommend Soft-picks to everyone, but particularly to those who have crowns and/or implants.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tolerate anything between my teeth. However, you can&#x27;t get away from the inevitable; especially when you love popcorn. These gum picks are WONDERFUL. They are leagues above regular toothpicks. A great addition to my dental hygiene regimen. They don&#x27;t replace flossing. I have some in my car, at home, in my carry bag and in my uniform at all times. I like offering them to other people and watching their amazement. I would recommend these to EVERYONE.</li>
    <li> Gets between the teeth well!  I have a built in retainer so I can floss normally, these are great for that.</li>
    <li> I use these regularly every day since I hate to floss.  Along with brushing twice a day, these make my dental cleaning visits much better.  The hygienist remarked how pink and healthy my gums were.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Cheaper at Costco though.</li>
    <li> I have  issues with food sticking between my teeth and wanted something strong enough to work like a tooth pick but soft enough to not irritate my gums.  these are perfect!  I&#x27;ll buy them again.</li>
    <li> Great easy solution that is much easier than flossing. I don&#x27;t think something like this can replace flossing. It is easy to bring these with you in the included small travel case, and using these quickly after meals is better than toothpicks and easier than flossing after every meal.</li>
    <li> These are great at getting everything between teeth. I have a bonded retainer (wire cemented to the back of my teeth) that makes it impossible to do traditional flossing - and a pain to use floss threaders.  I&#x27;ve it in over almost 15 year and worried about my gum health.  These work perfectly.  Gentle but effective.</li>
    <li> Undeniably great; nothing new to add except perhaps ... the notion of multiple uses?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If utilized with care, you pick can easily last you a week, saving you cash and more.</li>
    <li> I can do this  more easily than with floss string. My teeth are tight and difficult to pass floss down between them and I have to unroll one finger to pull it out. This makes a big difference for between my teeth cleaning.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted. My dentist recommended these and they work very well. I will reorder this product again.</li>
    <li> I like that this product is soft but it is too soft that it won&#x27;t get the food that is stuck in between my teeth.</li>
    <li> My dentist told me to use these and I was scared at first but after using them a couple times they made my gums feel great. I think that it is a great deal for how much you get.</li>
    <li> Dentist said to use it and wow does it work.  It does take some practice to not snap it while trying to get it in between the molars.  Works so well, it is alarming what can come out.  Helps clean the actual tooth too.  This is a good product but not a total floss replacement in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I think that everyone could benefit from using these soft-picks.  I was introduced to this brand by my dentist.  I have tried other dental pics (for gum health), but those other picks had twisted metal for the pick with a brush at the end.  I found them too thick for between some of my teeth &amp; the metal sometimes poked my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These instead are thinner &amp; more flexible.  They are also tapered at the tip, so they can get in between the teeth well, but the brushes are wider as you push them between your teeth. And I think impossible to poke yourself with as they are made from plastic that bends.  They do a good job cleaning any food particles from between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course you still need to floss (I learned that the hard way when I got a cavity between two teeth).  But these do an excellent job keeping the gums healthy.  And I think that they get food particles out better than floss.  So I brush first, then use the dental picks, then floss &amp; rinse with Listerine.  And that routine has really helped improve my dental health &amp; my gums are in great shape (no bleeding or gingivitis).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh -- one more thing -- the travel cases are very convenient!</li>
    <li> Like these picks?  Well, get a whole mess of them here and you will save a good amount.  Buying them in the supermarket is a rip off compared to this.  I love these things.  Every time I use them after I floss I feel I did such a crappy job flossy because I pull chunks from between my teeth. These things work.</li>
    <li> These are great.  As a dentist it is difficult to get people to floss.  But people love these.  I understand they also now come in a slightly wider size now but have not tried those yet.</li>
    <li> These are the BEST!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My teeth are very close together... this doesn&#x27;t do well if you have tight spaces to reach.</li>
    <li> Works great! I keep these at work for after lunch and getting out those embarrassing pieces of spinach or broccoli from between your teeth!  The bristles are soft enough so do not irritate my gums but I did find they start bending when I try to clean my back molars. Sometimes will still have to use floss on those back teeth. But overall I am very happy with this purchase and love the 3 travel cases that come with it. I gave my husband his own case of soft picks to take to work!</li>
    <li> Flexible, soft toothpicks to go. The travel cases make it nice to drop in your bag, glove box, etc. Cheaper than Walmart.</li>
    <li> I buy brand name, because no other product works as well.  I got compliments from my hygienist that my gums were in really good shape.  I do not bleed at cleanings.  I still use dental floss about once/week.</li>
    <li> I thought I was purchasing the New Soft picks, but this one arrived.&lt;br /&gt;They bend after the first tooth, not in the same class as the New Soft Picks</li>
    <li> My teeth are close together and certain areas are really hard to get floss into. My dentist recommended these and offered me a sample. I use them all the time now; and got tired of looking for them at local retailers. This pack comes with little carry case&#x27;s that make it easy to have with you all the time.  I am giving a 4 because they are a little fragile and bend a bit too easy. It would be nice if they were a little more durable.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE these pics....my dentist recommended that I use these, safer and more thorough than wood toothpicks...definety would buy these again....</li>
    <li> great day to day process to add to your regular brushing and flossing.  My dentist has complimented me on the improved health of my gums</li>
    <li> I use these with a proxie brush While the proxie brush takes care of the wider gaps in my teeth, and it does a good job with the deeper areas on the gum line, proxie brush cannot get into the smaller areas that the soft-picks handle well.  Also, i feel more comfortable using the disposable soft-picks after eating away from home.</li>
    <li> My holistic dentist recommended these to me, but I had already bought and was using them. They work and feel good, because they&#x27;re not too fat and fit in the smallest of spaces in and around my teeth.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended this since flossing alone wasn&#x27;t doing the job.  I use these after each meal and then floss at night. They are a bit flimsy and sometimes I need to use two.</li>
    <li> They work great for me but no one else in my family can get them between they&#x27;re teeth.</li>
    <li> Product works great, just like all of GUM&#x27;s oral care items!  Will buy them again when I need them!</li>
    <li> These soft picks are awesome. They are so much easier to use than floss and do a much better job. They have improved my dental checks ups and I will continue to use and buy them.</li>
    <li> I use these everyday, and the travel cases are very handy for car, pocket, night stand etc. I would recommend to all</li>
    <li> I was introduced to these over a year ago by a friend.  Beats the heck out of wooden toothpicks, they&#x27;re soft and easily get between your teeth to get the junk out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, not great, dental floss is better.</li>
    <li> I buy these in the volume pack for my wife, a great value and much better than buying the retail pack from grocery stores.  My wife loves them!  What more to say??</li>
    <li> I bought these because I had a new bridge installed and I thought I could use these instead of fishing floss under it.  but they were to stiff to go under the bridge.  Great tooth pick though for cleaning between your teeth.</li>
    <li> These soft tooth picks massage the gums, increase blood flow, clean out plaque and tarter, and are so easy to use. Much better than flossing and easier too!</li>
    <li> Soft and goes through tight teeth easily.</li>
    <li> The product sells to me and ן used it well</li>
    <li> These soft-picks work very well. A good way to keep your teeth very clean.  They stand up to use well.</li>
    <li> These are good.  I used to use wooden toothpicks as my floss, until my new dentist recommended these, because the wood picks are too thick to get in between some teeth and can cause damage.  I, in fact, did cause some damage with the old wooden picks and had to get some fillings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that these things are kind of fragile and often bend/break while I use them.  My other gripe is they are inconvenient to carry.  The little plastic container provided in some packages is a nice thought, but practically speaking, it is too small and too much of a pain to open and close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often use toothpicks in the car and can&#x27;t fumble around with these little plastic containers, which are not only too small, but then tearing off the individual toothpick is a clumsy ordeal too.  I actually thought it would be great if the company invented something along the lines of a Pez dispenser for these things that was more convenient to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have found that using an old Altoids tin works pretty well.</li>
    <li> I use these daily before I go to bed to do my flossing.  Because I have a little more space between my teeth than my wife these are much more effective for me to use rather than floss.</li>
    <li> An outstanding product.</li>
    <li> These are easy to use and gentle on my teeth.</li>
    <li> Really like it. Does a better job than regular floss.</li>
    <li> Soft-picks were recommended by my dental hygienist and work well to removed food particles lodged between teeth.  The travel packs are very convenient to keep in my purse.</li>
    <li> I have tried other brands of flossers and these are my absolute fave. It&#x27;s amazing, and disgusting, how much junk can be stuck between your teeth even after brushing. I will never buy another brand.</li>
    <li> I like these picks but I wish they would come in larger sizes. They work well for tight spaces and do feel great. But if you have slight gaps. They are too small. I really like that they come with the carrying case. Thats a bonus. Much better than carrying around a bag in your purse that most of these type picks come in.</li>
    <li> what dentist told  me to use</li>
    <li> I brought one to show my friend ....she already knew about these.  I can&#x27;t live without &#x27;em.  One of the places bad breath gets caught in between your teeth and this is a super easy way to get right in there. I think it feels extra clean...or not it doesn&#x27;t feel clean until I use one of these.  I rinse them and use &#x27;em a few times before throwing it away.</li>
    <li> I had a hard time getting these through my teeth at first, but after a couple of days it became much easier.  They are so much quicker and easier than using floss that you don&#x27;t have to be over the sink to use them.  They really help you in taking better care of your teeth, very convenient.  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> These GUM picks are the best on the market.  They hold up well during use and the carry case is handy for use during the day.</li>
    <li> The work and do fit my teeth okay.  I do prefer the others type I ordered which are the twisted wire with filament cleaner as they hold shape for me better.</li>
    <li> Great buy for your money.  I have tooth separation so this is perfect for me.  Also I love the extra traveling cases that comes with the product!</li>
    <li> The picks are tapered and have fine bristles that clean between teeth and massage gums. They feel very comfortable. While they don&#x27;t entirely replace floss, my gums are looking and feeling healthier.</li>
    <li> I have a confession, it&#x27;s weird, I know, but I love to floss. That&#x27;s right, I&#x27;m a closet flosser, and I floss after every meal. Even if we eat out I go to the bathroom after eating, go into a stall, and floss. Last week I went to the dentist. We discussed flossing and brushing (I passed) but then he suggested the Soft picks to not only floss but to massage my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmmm.. .massaging is nice. I went home with a sample pack of the soft picks and fell in love! The little brushes are gentle but oh they feel so good. They remove all the gunk down at the gum line and my gums feel stimulated. My son was saying his teeth were close together and these wouldn&#x27;t work, so I gave him one of my samples, Hah! He was sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are soft and bendy and I do have trouble in the very back teeth. I have tried holding my cheek out with one hand, going in from behind, but between my last molar and a wisdom tooth I just cannot get the soft pick in without bending it first. However, I can still floss that one area, and everywhere else these work wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Not much to say. Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> good product, and I love Amazon, but Costco sells them for a lot less</li>
    <li> A member of my wife&#x27;s family raved about this picks. I gave a try and boy things are different for good now. I haven&#x27;t see a dentist for about 9 months, using this soft pick after a meal or two, my dentist said that my gums are healthier then before, no cavities, and I&#x27;m on cloud 9.&lt;br /&gt;Saving money, energy, time and teeth!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!!!!! But hey, buy it and figure out for yourself.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these!  So much better than the ones that are made with wire.  These are soft and comfy. I have problems with plaque build up and flossing isn&#x27;t enough. These help where flossing fails.</li>
    <li> Great product; I would definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> How many dental care products make you want to do a thorough job? These do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, they don&#x27;t replace flossing but supplement that step. But they are a viable substitute when you can&#x27;t floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that I floss nightly, but use soft picks after every meal.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy these again,  just seemed like a glorified tooth pick&lt;br /&gt;but for the money they work ok</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this picks, but thought for the amount received at the price, plus the travel cases, it made sense to try them.  I was very pleased.  These work very well and are a little bit smaller than your normal pick.  However, the way they are designed with the &amp;#34;white handle&amp;#34; does not make this a problem even for someone with short, stubby hands.  Control is fine and the picks do the job.</li>
    <li> They get between the teeth to clean debris out and massage your gums.&lt;br /&gt;Just move the pick back and fourth between your teeth until you hear the squeak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft-Pick has Problem:&lt;br /&gt;The Soft-Pick &amp;#34;TIP&amp;#34; tens to break off,&lt;br /&gt;Be careful when using, not to stab your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes: This product cleans between your teeth better then Wooden Toothpicks.</li>
    <li> Great product to use in place of standard toothpicks. They are especially useful for cleaning under and around bridgework. They are soft and easy to get into tight spaces.</li>
    <li> My dentist insists! No more tender, bleeding areas deep between my rear molars. And, in case you&#x27;re wondering, I always take great care of my dental health. This was just one more improvement on my already good hygiene routine.</li>
    <li> Use them after every meal.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan if these. You have to use three to complete your whole mouth. They are not durable enough to last. The tips break off in your teeth spaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a good product.. I would no buy again.</li>
    <li> great product better than toothpicks. hard to find in stores around here.</li>
    <li> These work great - a good way to keep the teeth and gums clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best,&lt;br /&gt;Rob</li>
    <li> I used to hate to floss.  I tried the picks with the floss on the end, regular floss, etc,etc.  Nothing worked well, therefore, I didn&#x27;t floss.  Then my dentist recommended these.  They are wonderful.  Almost like using a toothpick, so it doesn&#x27;t need to go down and back up between the teeth (and get stuck between the tight fitting teeth!).  You simply use it at the base of the teeth-once in and out per space.  Easy and quick.  Now I &#x27;floss&#x27; every day and almost enjoy it!  Once in a while they break, which can be a pain, but if you are careful, they work well (the reason for 4 stars).  You need to go straight in.  But, overall I would definitely purchase them again.  Has me flossing.  And, this pack comes with three small hard plastic travel cases that will fit easily in my pocket or purse if I want to take some with me-holds approx. 20 picks. each.  Great price for a great product in my opinion!</li>
    <li> Nothing else comes close to doing what these little soft picks do!  They gently massage between your teeth, removing debris even below the gum line. My only complaint about them is for some reason there is a small area on the pick where there are no little rubbery pieces (about halfway up) and it can bend there, making the pick useless. BUT if you use the pick while standing in front of a mirror and use it slowly, you wont bend it in half and one single pick will do your whole mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drugstore knockoffs are hard and abrasive. I haven&#x27;t found anything else that feels as good as these do or that does as good a job.</li>
    <li> My family&#x27;s dentist, Kim, used to be our next door neighbor and our families have stayed friends for all these years even after they moved away.  A few years ago we were having dinner at their house and I got a bit of a taco shell stuck in my teeth.  I tried to discreetly snoop around their kitchen to find a toothpick.  I was trying to avoid announcing to her husband that \\&quot;I have a taco shell fragment lodged behind that big honker five-cusp molar that your wife is always teasing me about\\&quot;, so I kept casually looking through their pantry, spice cupboard, and drawers.  Finally I had to just come out and ask her husband, \\&quot;where do you guys keep your toothpicks?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;d think I&#x27;d asked him where they keep their crack pipes and dirty movies.  He looked stunned.  Then he told me \\&quot;we&#x27;re not allowed to use toothpicks in our family\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okie doke.  Faux pas committed.  I decided to live with the discomfort and not prod any further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So imagine my surprise at my last checkup.  You know how they send you home with those goodies, like a gift bag from the worlds worst birthday party?  A new toothbrush, floss that I hate to use, and some chapstick...for little ol&#x27; me?  I&#x27;m such a lucky boy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this last time I noticed my hygienist also loading something else in the bag.  They looked like cute little pipe cleaners, except I don&#x27;t smoke a pipe.  I asked her what they are.  She said that they&#x27;re \\&quot;floss picks, for people like you who hate to floss\\&quot;.  Busted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sample pack that the dentist gave me were kind of weird.  They actually were very much like pipe cleaners, even with a wire core.  I guess they were supposed to go into some kind of handle that you have to buy separately.  They seemed a little dangerous to me...kind of a choking hazard, but I trust myself not swallow the thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is way better than those samples though.  These have a flat plastic end for gripping, and the inner core of the brush is plastic too.  These things fit great in between my teeth.  Even though I&#x27;ve actually been flossing a lot more since my last cleaning, these soft-picks make my teeth feel cleaner than they do after flossing.  My teeth actually feel just like they do after a dentist visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pack seems like a good value too.  You get three packs of 80 picks.  Each of the three packs has a little \\&quot;travel case\\&quot; that fits about 20 picks.  That&#x27;s nice, because I&#x27;d like to keep some of these in my desk at work.  I also do travel quite a bit, so the little cases help out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For once the little gift bag from the dentist really did pay off.  I&#x27;m glad to finally be able to use a toothpick variant that&#x27;s sanctioned by my pal the dentist.  I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to sneak toothpicks when we dine at their home anymore.ic too.  These things fit great in between my teeth.

    <li> The little bristles get everything out of the tiny little spaces.  I had braces when I was a child, so I don&#x27;t have a lot of little spaces but my husband does and they work well for him too.  We both love these things.</li>
    <li> The quality rubber is best feature of this product.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt my gum ever, and cleanse it thoroughly in every corner of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The daunting number of 240 is another beautiful attribute of this beaut.&lt;br /&gt;I will always use this thing as long as I live. So so great</li>
    <li> Flossing has been a total hassle for me since getting braces.  I didn&#x27;t know that a product like this existed (other than those rigid flossing toothpicks that are too large) and so was amazed after my dentist gave me a trial pack.  The tips are not only small/thin enough to fit between the teeth near the gums but they are coated with a thin layer of what seems to be latex - which gives it a rubbery texture to grab onto whatever needs to be removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that if you don&#x27;t try inserting the tip at just the right angle then the tip will bend (at least in my case where tight fits are everwhere).  Nevertheless, the quality and value here has me very happy.  I would gladly buy these again...</li>
    <li> We love these and are very pleased with the bulk pricing. Very convenient to carry in flat case provided. Comfortable. Easier to use than flossing!</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to trying these, but when I actually needed them they just bent. The soft bristles are a good idea, but the pick it self is too soft to work the bristles in between teeth. It&#x27;s like using a soggy noodle as a tooth brush.</li>
    <li> Wish they were a little bit firmer. They bend easily and then you can&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT, WORKS VERY WELL.</li>
    <li> Received in a reasonable time. They&#x27;re exactly what I ordered and they work fine.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I ordered and needed.</li>
    <li> very good product thank you very much</li>
    <li> Works very well when they hold up. Older ones from last year used to be better as these bend and break easier now. The coating that actually cleans between your teeth comes apart easily in some batches so I marked down a star.</li>
    <li> It may seem strange to see a rave review about what is essentially a fancy toothpick, but having used several types of picks over the years I can say from experience that this is an outstanding product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive gums, and the tiny plastic prongs on this pick are so soft that I hardly feel them when in use (much softer than the kind with little bristle brushes or the solid plastic picks). These are small, and even though they are attached to each other in groups of 5 picks, be sure to use the plastic container to hold 10-15 of them for travel--otherwise they will tend to get lost in your toiletries case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know, these are much more expensive than wood toothpicks, but I found it convenient and less expensive to buy these in bulk--three containers of 80 each. The price is the only downside I can think of, but it is not enough to keep me from giving these a 5-star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no business or personal relationship with the manufacturer of this product and I have paid for the product myself.</li>
    <li> These were not quite what I expected.  I expected little brushes but instead they have little rubberized nubs.  They are still useful, just not what I expected.</li>
    <li> We use the soft-picks daily and our dental hygienist is happy that we do so!  Very little work for them at our 6 month checkups.</li>
    <li> Great price for this multi pack.  My dentist told me to get and use soft picks, and so I looked on Amazon, since at the time I had no idea what a soft pick was, and here they were.  I checked the store after I had ordered these and they were much more expensive in the store than on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;They work as intended and are not too hard on my gums.</li>
    <li> Ok, but too soft and bendy.</li>
    <li> So convenient at any time.  I love to floss and these are very useful.</li>
    <li> My dentist introduced me to these several years ago, and they are just about as good as a product gets, for teeth-cleaning between brushes.  I&#x27;ve offered them to several people over the years, following meals in restaurants, and every single one of them have said, OH BABY, where have you been all of my life!  This is a perfect size, which includes 3 handy pocket carry cases.</li>
    <li> This product cleans between your teeth without causing any pain. They are a pliable plastic that bends as they go thru a small space to clean. It gets to the spots much better than a tooth brush.</li>
    <li> I have big spaces between several teeth that constantly cause me trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had kept a bottle brush type cleaner in my desk but it never felt sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are soft, easy to use, and obviously much more hygienic.</li>
    <li> Great item. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> The Hygenist insisted I try these and I really like them, they also are far more pleasurable than floss. Utilizing the scheduled shipping options makes for another win win.</li>
    <li> No cavities since using. These are easy to use&amp; carry in pockets.</li>
    <li> We are addicted to these.  They are so comfortable to use!  Can&#x27;t be without these.  I like the little carry cases.</li>
    <li> Fair price. Service was good.</li>
    <li> way too expensive and does not clean well.</li>
    <li> great to use on the road, keep in my purse all the time</li>
    <li> Works extremely well for the dental work I had recently that allows me to floss easily my bottom front teeth. The price is right and the results are excellent.</li>
    <li> I love these.  They are so much easier to use then dental floss.  Even my dental appointments have been a lot better.  I can&#x27;t believe&lt;br /&gt;what a difference they&#x27;ve made.  I wish I would have known about these a lot sooner.</li>
    <li> They make my teeth feel cleaner than when I floss.  Small cases (included in package) make the soft-picks convenient to carry with me.</li>
    <li> Mom requested.  She used to use wired brush on a adapter handle, but these are more convenient.  This review is even before I actually got the items.</li>
    <li> I have all caps plus six implants. Teeth very close. Can&#x27;t live without these soft picks. Next best thing to flossing</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended these picks instead of regular floss. He said one pick can last up to a month if it doesn&#x27;t get bent at all, but I always seem to bend them so I got this jumbo pack. It should still last me at least a year with everyday use. It&#x27;s three separate packs of 80, which each come with a small plastic travel case that easily fits 20 picks. So 3 cases and 240 picks total. Great deal for $15 and 2 day shipping.</li>
    <li> Love these little things! Better than a toothpick and because I&#x27;m going from side to side instead of up and down I can use them without fear of pulling a crown off!  I like the little travel kit, it&#x27;s easy to keep them in my purse without losing them or getting dirt or lint on them.</li>
    <li> Got two kids with braces and getting them to brush and floss requires daily reminders.  The special string floss designed for braces is such a hassle and very difficult for my kids to use.  I ended up having to floss their teeth for them several times a day until I found these floss picks.  These picks are so easy to use, soft and effective.  An absolute must have if your kids have braces!</li>
    <li> Great price for daily use</li>
    <li> A 100% more efficient than traditional flossing.</li>
    <li> I especially liked the little carrying case included.</li>
    <li> I have been using these a few months and it does make my teeth feel much cleaner.  I like that they are not too tough on my gums, but defiantly are subbing them clean.</li>
    <li> Timely delivery, and was as expected.</li>
    <li> These make flossing a lot easier then it was before, I have braces and I save a lot of time with these. I also tried the other ones that look like a needle and these are much better.</li>
    <li> excellent product they do not scratch or hurt your gums and they clean out the food</li>
    <li> I really like these.  I&#x27;ve always been a regular floss person but switched to these at the suggestion of my hygienist and now much prefer them to floss.</li>
    <li> My dentist gave me a sample package - I used them every day, my next check-up for cleaning - the dental assistant said &amp;#34;you have virtually no plaque on your teeth and your gums were excellent&amp;#34;.  Heretofore, this has not been the case.  The rubber picks are not painful and very easily fit into tight spots -  The best check-up results I have had in years.  A great product...</li>
    <li> Excellent product; poor packaging.</li>
    <li> Arrived very Fast and convenient too.</li>
    <li> extremely convenient way to floss</li>
    <li> Too large to fit into my tightly packed teeth.  And I imagine it would hurt my gums also.</li>
    <li> Great to have in the office after lunch to ensure nothing is in between teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dental professional.  This is the best between the teeth product ever made (in my opinion).  Evidence shows it as effective as flossing... but I&#x27;d choose to use this and floss picks (both) every day.</li>
    <li> I like these in addition to regular floss.  I just don&#x27;t like them as a substitute as I had planned on using them.  They are fairly easy to use and get between your teeth with out much effort.  I have difficulty in reaching the very back of my mouth.  The travel case is nice and convenient to have.  I don&#x27;t think I can recommend these overall though.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Easy to use and the check ups will tell the tale.  I am very hopeful that gum health will be improved.</li>
    <li> Better than tooth pick, better that dents stix - gets into the grooves of teeth and are very comfortable to use</li>
    <li> soft tips slide between teeth instead of stabbing gums like wire based products</li>
    <li> These work great, and this travel case is a great value too.  These are much easier to use than floss, they are easy to use, do a great job, and were recommended by our dentist.  Teeth cleaning appointments have been a breeze since using them.</li>
    <li> much better deal than buying in stores&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a couple other pics and as far as disposable type, I like these the best</li>
    <li> These are indispensible.</li>
    <li> I was using dr&#x27;s tooth brushes to go between my teeth. But occassionly would hurt my lip or gum line with the hard plastic. Now I got this - so soft and pliable with long soft rubber tips.  I give this a 5 star rating. I will be a life time customer.</li>
    <li> These are super little cleaning devices, and easier to handle than floss. They come with a tiny plastic carry device so I always have them with me. My only comment, I was sent pink Breast Cancer Awareness Soft-picks, and while I totally support the cause, I even do the annual Walk for the Cure in my community, I would have preferred green. My dentist recommended these to me and gave me a sample, and I am totally sold on the product.</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t wide enough to do a great job cleaning large spaces, like around my son&#x27;s braces.  They are great for getting food out of your teeth but do not replace flossing b/c you can&#x27;t bring them all the way up to clean between the surface of the teeth; they just push in through the bottom near the gum line, and then you pull them out again.  Won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended these since I have some areas in my mouth that are hard to floss.  These work great and I can actually use them to massage the gums.  I keep a supply at home, purse and office.  Much better than those toothpick holders.</li>
    <li> Love these picks and wasn&#x27;t able to find them in any store except in small expensive packs.  Like these more than the wooden picks out there.  Great for getting food from between tight teeth.</li>
    <li> I am a terrible flossier and these are so much less annoying to use. I can sit and watch TV and clean between my teeth. They are like a fancy toothpick and I can throw some in my purse in the travel case when I go out to eat.</li>
    <li> Just not enough in the pack for the money.  I love these, but when everyone else started to use them, I ran out within a few days.  I wish there were more in the pack.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended me to use these picks for hard to reach areas. It does help clear out food stuck in the back where floss is hard to reach. I did notice if I try too hard it can break. Good price for a 3 pack.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product.  I love the little carrying cases.  I noticed that this item is now carried at Costco!  The picks will fit between teeth where there is a significant gap, the type where food particles are most likely to lodge.  The picks will not fit between tightly adjacent teeth.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It will not fit inbetween all of your teeth, and it will not replace other floss products, but it will be an excellent one-two punch  if you combine it with regular floss string or floss picks.  Personally, I get a little soft plaque inbetween the lower four teeth at the front of my mouth, the four lower incisors. I can remove it with my floss picks, but it is tedious and time consuming.  However, this thing works perfectly to stick inbetween those incisors and scrub the hard to reach tooth walls, on both sides!  I will never have any plaque inbetween the incisors again due to this product.  I love it.  But again, as I said, you won&#x27;t be able to just use this to replace your other floss products, because it won&#x27;t fit inbetween most of your other teeth.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended these. I have used them for years. Love them and they are cheaper from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Ggod price&lt;br /&gt;Essential in every home &amp; wallet</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to these things. I use them several times a day, after every meal. They feel so good on my gums and help me clean food from between my teeth. I&#x27;m grateful for the multipack since I use so many of them.</li>
    <li> Love these things...much better for your gums that wood toothpicks!</li>
    <li> These are GREAT -- my dental checkups are so much less painful since I put these brush picks into my nightly routine.  I have a lot of trouble using dental floss due to rheumatoid arthritis, and my dentist was unhappy with the state of my gums.  But now he&#x27;s happy and my gums are much, much healthier.  So much easier to use than floss, and much more portable too.</li>
    <li> I use these all the time and have a hard time finding them in the stores and they are pricey.  It was great to be able to order them and get a good stockpile on hand so I don&#x27;t always have to keep searching for them only to find the store is out or they only have 1 package available to buy.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2ILD88ZVZQJO]]You will love the Soft Picks!</li>
    <li> I bought these picks this week and I love them.  I usually use wood toothpicks every day, but these are way better.  Comparison below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush Picks&lt;br /&gt;These are a little spendy, but they are worth it.  I have used about 2-3 per day over the last week (I need something to do while I sit in my cube) and I can&#x27;t get over how much I like them.  If you have a permanent retainer, there isn&#x27;t anything better than these pics.  My dentist always recommends that I use glide floss to get under the retainer, but I, like everyone else, am too lazy to floss with not only regular floss, but glide floss as well (the glide floss is never strong enough to make it through all of your teeth, so you have to use regular floss for most of your teeth, then the glide for your teeth with the retainer).  I am too lazy to do both, so I skip the glide.  Now, my lower gums are actually healthy!!! They are always clean and for the first time, the swelling has gone down.  Note: I have extremely clean, white teeth, but my bottom gums are always a little swollen because I am too lazy to floss under my bottom retainer.  But, not any more!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wood Toothpicks&lt;br /&gt;My work has these toothpicks in our cafeteria.  Like pretty much wood picks everywhere, they are free.  But this doesn&#x27;t mean they are good.  Every time I use them my gums bleed.  I split them the long way to get between my teeth, but they just don&#x27;t work very well.  I end up just tasting blood all day while I sit in my cube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for anyone.</li>
    <li> These are the best picks out there.  They feel so good on your gums.  They fit in tight spots.  They really are soft as the name implies.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping.  Nice product.  Would order from this vendor again.  Good price.</li>
    <li> This pick works great for my tooth spacing, and is a good suplement to flossing. Good packaging. Good value. M</li>
    <li> Like the picks but the travel cases are really not effective or sturdy.  Would not order again for that reason alone.</li>
    <li> Being plastic they sometimes get bent enough to be useless and I might have to use more than one to get the job done. I can&#x27;t stand the ones with metal wire holding the bristles, my teeth are way too sensitive for that, so it&#x27;s a very small price to pay. Since I use a few a day, a large pack like this is nice to have. They have helped contribute to very noticeable improvements in my gums. Last time to the hygienist was the best report ever.</li>
    <li> It is so useful, and kids love them! The baby floss has limitations, the adult string type floss scares kids, so this one adds value to let them learn and get use to floss.</li>
    <li> arrived very fast  and very good product.  Recomendable.</li>
    <li> These soft-picks stimulate your gums and clears out the particles of food that try to hide. My hygienist said she could tell I was doing something different. No change in gum density.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how often you find something that&#x27;s truly innovative in things you use daily, but this is one in my book.  These soft rubbery picks with soft teeth like easily get between teeth and gums with comfort.  I don&#x27;t have the problem of floss digging into my gums and causing bleeding.  These little picks are not just more comfortable, I find them more effective than floss and because of the comfort, I always use these every day if not multiple times a day.  Is it any I first found these because my dentist gave me a sample.  Just a guess, but I&#x27;d bet because of their comfort, ease of use and effectiveness, utilization goes way up.  It definitely did in my case.  If there&#x27;s a knock to give these picks, it&#x27;s their durability.  If you hit a tooth or a gum straight on, you can bend the pick, rendering it pretty useless so you have to get another. I can usually clean my teeth with just two per cleaning.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use these instead of toothpicks. Toothpicks can be a little hard on the gums, but these are nice and soft and flexible. I received a sample from my dentist and loved them, so decided to order them. We use them every day.</li>
    <li> My dentist gave me a sample to use on my dental implants since they are made of soft synthetic material that won&#x27;t damage the implant where plaque can gather and damage your gums. I liked them so much I bought the large pack. They are soft and bend and break if you&#x27;re not careful or have tight fitting teeth. I have only one area where it&#x27;s tight so I&#x27;m careful when I get to that tooth since that&#x27;s where I usually bend the pick. I also do that tooth last so I know I&#x27;ll get full use of the each pick. Each one lasts me 3 or 4 uses if I&#x27;m careful and I&#x27;m good with that. It takes less than a minute to get every tooth and I always get particles, even after flossing. Sometimes several particles, so it&#x27;s worth the time and money. It cost about $16 for 240, multiplied by 3 uses each, equaling 720 or about 2 years worth for me. A small price to pay for better dental hygiene. it also comes with little carrying cases that are convenient for storage.</li>
    <li> I use a rotary electric tooth brush which cleans really well below the gumline. I am amazed at the amount of residual food and placque these picks push out from between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hygienist recommended these, and most of my 4mm pockets had returned to 3mm or less at the next checkup.</li>
    <li> I think these interdental brushes are the best available ones, yet they are not perfect. they fit between most teeth but not all. it depends on the contact between the teeth.</li>
    <li> I read about these online and read the glowing Amazon reviews. I felt compelled to order them. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of flossing and these appear somewhat portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, they are just thin flexible plastic toothpicks. They are fine for cleaning food from your teeth after a meal, but they are a poor substitute for floss. They don&#x27;t fit into tight spaces between teeth for daily removal of plaque. They are small enough to get into any spaces where food particles may become lodged, but that&#x27;s it. They work well for cleaning the few tooth-gaps in my mouth that they fit into. They aren&#x27;t small enough to replace floss when cleaning plaque (biofilms) from tightly-spaced teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are fairly-gentle and I didn&#x27;t have any bleeding or sore gums (but I don&#x27;t with floss either).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package includes small plastic carrying cases, so you can keep them in your pocket, purse, or glove box. That&#x27;s great, but floss is portable too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend that you just stick to floss if seeking a portable oral hygiene solution.</li>
    <li> If you hate flossing as I do but want to do the right thing, you&#x27;ll love Softpicks. They do it all with one hand.</li>
    <li> I bought these first from Costco.  When I went back, they didn&#x27;t have any more.  I love these for cleaning between your teeth.</li>
    <li> Several years ago I made a resolution to take better care of my teeth.  Other family members had suffered through dental surgery for gum disease and I didn&#x27;t want that to happen to me.  I struggled with using dental floss because it was hard and messy and where my teeth cross or are too close together, I was constantly getting the floss stuck or tearing it.  A dental assistant shared a tip with me that using toothpicks regularly could work almost as well.  Apparently, they did because I started getting good reviews on my dental visits but even better are these soft-picks.  They are more comfortable and safer than hard picks and they even work with my bridge.  There are harder plastic versions available that work the same and hold up better but they are also tougher on gum tissue.  I would recommend these to a friend.</li>
    <li> My fault,but I thought the travel case held all 1/3 of the picks, the picture is deceiving . I would not have bought them if I realized the cases were just small</li>
    <li> These arrived exactly as promised and expected.  It was packaged as pictured with a large carboard piece with three separate containers holding 80 picks and each set had its own case.  I like this because you can open only one of the blister packs at a time which is nice way to keep them organized.  Overall, I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> My dentist gave me a sample of these soft picks and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get some more.  I use them after every meal and they really clean well between my teeth.  I can even reach the back, hard to reach teeth.</li>
    <li> Great product, just like described, very good seller . Thank you</li>
    <li> This should last me for the next couple of years. Buying in bulk cut the cost in half saving me $</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this tooth picks to me.  I love it very much!  Efficient, secure and comfortable! My husband and myself use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Great item and even better price-we love using these to clean our teeth after flossing</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff. Why didn&#x27;t I discover these sooner? These are toothpicks on steroids. These can go between your teeth and pick out all sorts of gunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, my wife couldn&#x27;t use them because her teeth were too close together. I would get a sample pack, if possible, and see if you can use these.</li>
    <li> Very flimsy, I can&#x27;t seem to be able to get them to work right</li>
    <li> I have had a permanent fixed retainer for the past 20 years or so. It is attached to every tooth along its length. This makes flossing very time consuming as I have to thread the floss under the retainers. I thought these picks were the answer.&lt;br /&gt;I have just had an extension deep tooth cleaning with my dental hygienist, and hoped these picks would enable faster cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the picks are too wide to fit between several of my teeth, and once they bend they will no longer hold their shape. They taper out a lot, which makes getting them far enough between teeth to allow proper cleaning difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not a replacement to dental floss. They do a great job between teeth with a fairly wide gap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they were a little thinner and a little more resistant to bending then they would be perfect. Obviously everyones teeth are different, but if like me your teeth are close together you may find these are too wide to fit.</li>
    <li> Picks were good to use but cheaper at Costco</li>
    <li> I use these regularly at the recommendation of my dentist and they have helped improve the results I get a dental visits!</li>
    <li> I have a tendency to cut my gums when I floss, which leaves me with inflammation.  I&#x27;ve been using Soft picks for a week now and I can brush my teeth without any bleeding.  I am a convert!</li>
    <li> Good, but nothing replaces flossing. I usually use floss at night time and these in the morning when I&#x27;m rushing around getting ready for work.</li>
    <li> Soft, slender, fits gently in between my teeth where even floss is difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a bunch of these and put the handy little boxes EVERYWHERE - - travel kit, auto glove-box, garage workshop, office desk drawer. Wouldn&#x27;t ever be without them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first dental checkup after starting to use these showed a marked improvement: shallower gum pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> These soft picks are wonderful for getting in between your teeth and getting to all of those inconvenient spots.  My dental hygienist introduced them to me and I really use them daily.</li>
    <li> These things go everywhere I do because they&#x27;re great at getting anything left behind out of my braces. They were recommended to my by my orthodontist&#x27;s office. They&#x27;re very flexible so they won&#x27;t damage any hardware and for those without braces, they comfortably fit between small gaps without causing gum irritation.</li>
    <li> I had braces growing up and my teeth are very aligned and close together, which makes these soft picks really too big to fit in between most of my teeth.  Too bad because I do like their softness, but it causes bleeding for me because I can hardly get them through.  Because they are so flexible, it is hard to reach between your back teeth.  I wanted to like these, but they do not really work that well for me.</li>
    <li> These soft picks are my first choice over the wooden picks. I&#x27;ve used these for the past few years and order them through amazon for price purposes.</li>
    <li> these work great at massaging the gums between the teeth, its also a great value pack. My dentist recommended them so I looked around amazon had the best price and they work wonderfully.</li>
    <li> These are favourite picks to use after eating. They are soft and very efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: Buy them @ Costco. I picked up the 240ct for 9.99.</li>
    <li> I am a retired orthodontist, &amp; my wife a retired general dentist. In short, these soft-tipped interdental cleaning picks are wonderful!!!&lt;br /&gt;They are gentle and very easy to use. I keep a supply neatly stored in its own small travel case in my vehicle&#x27;s glove compartment, my wife does the same, as well as in my backpack, &amp; medicine cabinet.  For really optimal home care, to maintain good oral health, get a prescription from your dentist for a pint of Chlorhexidine Glucanate, 0.12% Oral Rinse...half fill the bottle cap, dip the green tip of the pick into this before you proceed to place it between each of your teeth to deposit a little anti-micrbial fluid while simultaneously providing hygiene to the areas between your teeth, &amp; adjacent soft tissue.  Especially ideal for people with &amp;#34;braces&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;fixed bridges&amp;#34;, since it is more difficult &amp; time consuming to clean under these dental appliances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reservation that people should be aware of is that some individuals will not have a large enough triangular space below the contacts between two adjacent teeth to allow passage of the pick completely through the space between some of their teeth.  No charge!!!</li>
    <li> Most important these work great on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But amazingly, the packaging is perfect. I didn&#x27;t have to rip it apart with my teeth or a box-cutter.</li>
    <li> These are so good.  They are soft so they don&#x27;t irritate the gums but they have a brush on the end to get between the teeth.  They come with small plastic cases that will hold 5.  I keep one in my purse.</li>
    <li> i just don&#x27;t like floss... this does the job and my hygienist doesn&#x27;t suspect I do this instead...</li>
    <li> Great value and work great.</li>
    <li> An efficient way to buy these items, if not necessarily cost effective.  Saves making trips to the drug store when you run out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not really fair to say the product is great, because I already knew that from prior use.  But this is the first time I ordered them online.  They are exactly what I wanted at a terrific price.  I ordered over the weekend and got them on the following Wednesday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But back to the product.  I use these every day and floss when I can.  My dentist has been proud of me.  LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for listening.</li>
    <li> I am an adult, and wearing my braces again since my teeth have shifted. I am telling you, by far, these are the most amazing things to pick your teeth, massage your gum and clean your gaps with. These are tiny but mighty, they are pretty strong actually. They clean out the teeth well and keep them from getting infected. I use one for the upper and one for the lower after each meal before i brush my teeth. I mean while at work, it is not feasible to floss, these are the best alternative. I started to use them even before my braces....</li>
    <li> this product is perfect!  Helps clean my teeth, doesn&#x27;t cut or scrape my gums and still gets the job done.  And in this packaging (with the carry case) it is perfect for traveling and never being without a tooth pick!!</li>
    <li> My teeth are very tight, so it&#x27;s almost impossible for me to use floss, at times my husband has had to cut the floss with small scissors so I could remove it. I&#x27;ve tried the sticks with a small brush and found them irritating.  These soft-picks for tight teeth have been a God-send.  My last dental appointment showed no more bleeding gums, or tartar around my gum line.  They take a little practice because they are supple and bend easily, but it you grasp them just below the tab they are easier to insert.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been flossing for a long time but there are some areas that floss just doesn&#x27;t get to, including the space between the tooth and the gum on a bridge (a false tooth that is glued between two natural teeth).  At my last checkup, my dentist showed me these cool little plastic tabs with rubber &#x27;Christmas tree-shaped&#x27; tips that slide in between teeth (and between the top of that tooth and the gum, in the case of my bridge).  They do a really good job, and the price here is great.  There are three separate packages with this order, and each of the 3 packages has its own little mini-carrying case that fits easily in pocket or purse. or ashtray. You could even slide a few into your phone case, or stash a couple in your hair. You never know when you&#x27;re gonna want a corned beef sandwich, and we all know where that leads.</li>
    <li> These things are great, they really get into those hard to reach spaces in your teeth.  These work better than toothpicks and I do not think that floss is even  necessary if these are being used,</li>
    <li> I really do not care for flossing. These do a great job and my dental hygienist remarked about the reduction of plaque from my last visit. I use them daily.</li>
    <li> Try these he said and sure enough I did with some reluctance but that was short-lived.  I bought a smaller pack and then these only to find that this is a better deal and I can keep one pack in each bathroom in the ready position for any picking necessary.  They fit between teeth with ease and perform more satisfactorily than other picks of wood or stiff plastic.  They are small but do a major job of removing \\&quot;stuff.\\&quot; I do not believe they will replace floss; however, they are a perfect addition to significant oral health and they work fantastically.  Thanks, Doc and here&#x27;s one for you.</li>
    <li> MY DENTIST GAVE ME A SAMPLE PACK. I TRIED THEM FOR ABOUT A WEEK. I LOVE THEM .....I WILL CONTINUE TO USE SOFT-PICKS.</li>
    <li> I love this thing, it is great to keep your theet clean not hurting your gums. This is an Inexpensive great solution.</li>
    <li> Outstanding price, product, and delivery.</li>
    <li> the dentist is very please with my check ups since i have started to use go betweens</li>
    <li> I purchased these because my dentist recommended them and they work great, I love them, and will continue to use. Costco has them a bit cheaper than amazon, so the next time I got them I did purchase them from there but Costco often has something for awhile and then not, so I&#x27;ll for sure get them from amazon. :)</li>
    <li> Nice to have these little things in the car and everywhere else I need them but dont otherwise have a way to carry around</li>
    <li> Our dentist gave us a couple of packs of these.  We were so impressed that we bought a bunch of them.  I carry a case (they are little and don&#x27;t take up much room) in my purse.  A man could easily carry a case in a pocket.  They are very gentle on your gums but do a great job.  They even, to a point, remove light plaque.</li>
    <li> dentist suggested...much better than floss</li>
    <li> Great for cleaning between teeth.</li>
    <li> These are great for getting food out from between your teeth. They do a better job than using floss.</li>
    <li> Good bye, but we stopped likeing these after several weeks.....Still like our wooden ones....sorry!  Just be gentler on your gums and go easy...wood is really better...</li>
    <li> Buying in bulk is the way to go on these...</li>
    <li> I have arthritis in my jaw and it is difficult to floss properly.  My dentist&#x27;s hygienist suggested using these about two years ago.  My gums never get irritated or bleed during cleanings at the dentist&#x27;s office now which is a big change.  I carry them with me wherever I go so food removal is quick and easy.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and does a great job to clean your teeth. The handy carry case is also great.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I only received a quantity of 76 as mentioned in the fine print!  Buyer beware!&lt;br /&gt;The product itself works well though.</li>
    <li> I use these daily on my teeth.  The pick and brush work amazing as I have periodontal problems and they have helped to rel eave this.  Easy to carry, price is great, and are recyclable.</li>
    <li> Love this product. They are soft. Feels so good. Smooth and massaging. No poking or roughness. I can hear it squeaking against my teeth so I know it is working. I am also able to bend the stick without it breaking to get an angle on it for reaching the back teeth easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are definitely a plus for anyone who has a dental implant who needs to take special care to keep the area clean of food getting stuck between the tooth and gum. No metal on these so it is safe to use.</li>
    <li> The 240 soft pick purchase was exactly what I wanted. The cost was almost 75% less than I had been paying.&lt;br /&gt;It was an unexpected bonus when they arrived within 4 days of ordering. I will use this vendor again whenever possible.</li>
    <li> My husband uses these instead of toothpicks. I like them because if one finds its way on the floor I don&#x27;t have to worry about it sticking in my foot like the toothpicks. This item is expensive in the stores &amp; my husband way glad to find them at AMAZON at a better price &amp; larger quanity.</li>
    <li> Works well if you have tight teeth (unlike most of other products that shred). Would buy it again although a bit pricey...</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended these soft-picks and even gave me a few sample ones.  Only time will tell if these will actually help me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very interesting thing here is that there are many different package sizes and some have travel cases and some do not.  The price I paid for 240 with the 3 travel cases was significantly less then some of the other smaller packages without the travel cases.  I went to the manufacturers web site to very that these were legitimate (it was that much less expensive) At first the manufacturer stated that they do not make a 240 pack and that concerned me BUT then the manufacturer went to Amazon to see what I was talking about and when she saw this she informed me that these are legitimate and that this was a special package created for Costco.  I ended up ordering several packages of these</li>
    <li> These are far superior to the ones that are really miniature nylon bristles with metal center.  It is dangerous to use anything with metal part to use as dental picks.  These ones will not cause any inadvertent abrasion.  I feel clean after using these.  It is possible to rinse these clean and use the same pick for several days before tossing it out.</li>
    <li> I use these daily.  This is s good price if you use them often. Works great and don&#x27;t hurt your gums.</li>
    <li> These are the ONLY picks I will use.  The soft rubbery feel glides between my teeth without any excess pushing or any pain.  Some picks these days are made out of a plastic type brush, I will never ever use that type again.  I would pay triple the amount asked for these due to the quality and comfort of the rubbery brush.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;Soft-Picks&amp;#34; are good and do a good job , but in my opinion, there are better ones available. The &amp;#34;Soft -Picks&amp;#34; are soft and work between most teeth but  don&#x27;t do well when the teeth are very close together. So I prefer the &amp;#34;interdental toothpicks&amp;#34; available at &amp;#34;RITE AID&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;interdental toothpicks&amp;#34;  are stiffer and have two ends , one for smaller spaces  and one for the larger spaces between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;interdental toothpicks&amp;#34; are also less expensive.</li>
    <li> Stay with the regular ones.. Green is better than the blue... bend easy until you learn how to use then ......</li>
    <li> Works very well for tooth implants.</li>
    <li> My sister got me on to these picks and I love them.</li>
    <li> I like these picks and use them often.  They perform well.  However, I can&#x27;t help but wish they were a little sturdier as some bend too easily and once they bend they&#x27;re useless.</li>
    <li> Great product for cleaning teeth without hurting gums. You must try it to see what I&#x27;m talking about. Also excellent for stimulating gum line with no pain.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this product over dental floss since I have larger spaces between some of my teeth.  I like these.</li>
    <li> These are pretty great floss substitutes. They are *far* easier to use than dental floss, which is such a pain that I rarely used it.</li>
    <li> It is so handy to have these in great supply.</li>
    <li> keeps my teeth healthy and clean free of tarter</li>
    <li> I recently got braces at age 43, and am addicted to these. I still use a flower, but these are great after meals. The pack I got has a nice travel case which fits discreetly into your purse. Excuse yourself after your meal, clean your teeth, and smile confidently!</li>
    <li> Easy to carry while traveling with little carrying cases. I use them every day. Fits between my tight teeth.</li>
    <li> I love these things. They are my new favorite oral care accessory. My teeth feel so CLEAN after using them!</li>
    <li> very good for between teeth cleaning -- only problem is that the picks tend to bend and become unusable and they are quite expensive -- I also use the wooden triangular picks which do not bend.</li>
    <li> +++++  Exactly what I wanted and at a very good price and &amp;#34;fast&amp;#34; - THANK YOU, gene</li>
    <li> The theory of these is good.  The reality is not so good.  They collapsed when inserted between teeth that really needed help.</li>
    <li> I ripped apart the \\&quot;Doctor&#x27;s Brand BrushPicks Toothpicks\\&quot; a minute ago, so I suppose it would behoove me to recommend the reason why I rated those so low--namely, GUM SoftPicks.  Without hesitation, I have to say the GUM SoftPicks are the best thing to happen in oral hygiene since chewing bark was replaced with toothbrushes and baking soda.  The soft ribbed rubber tips are pliable w/o being useless, firm w/o ripping apart your gums.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend abandoning flossing altogether, but if you care enough to try these, you probably don&#x27;t need that advice anyways. :-)  Good luck, enjoy, and I hope your experience is as good as mine has been.  (I actually originally got these as a 5-piece sample from my dentist, and by the time I was using the 2nd one, I realized I&#x27;d better find some of these quick, before I ran out...hence my purchasing the 240-pak.  I&#x27;ve shared them with several dozen friends and family members, some of whom were using the aforementioned \\&quot;Doctor&#x27;s BrushPicks\\&quot;, all of whom have since begun using, or switched to using the softpicks instead.  I hate being wasteful, so if anyone is interested, I have all but 2 of the BrushPicks that I won&#x27;t be using.  I&#x27;ll ship them to you free--I certainly won&#x27;t be using them!)</li>
    <li> Love these I keep them in my car,  brief case, desk and use them all the time.  They were recommended by my dentist</li>
    <li> I love these things and use them several times a day. Best picks I have found yet and I have tried many. Delighted to find this large economic size. Target just added an 80 count finally, but this is the best deal and convenient large number of picks</li>
    <li> Essential and not easy to find but when you do, you will pay more.  The travel cases became more important then I thought.</li>
    <li> Had a cavity and my dentist suggested these. They work great and my gums are now a 10! Works great.</li>
    <li> I use these everyday just to keep the dentist&#x27;s drill away.  They are an extraordinary tool to keep my mouth, teeth and gums&lt;br /&gt;healthy!</li>
    <li> Somehow regular use of dental floss was more than I could do.  Such a pain in the butt.  Always slipping off my fingers or cutting into them.  These picks do at least as well and are so convenient.  Only issue may be that they will not go(are not intended to go into very tight spaces.  That is, teeth that have essentially no space between them, at any height.  That doesn;t bother me, I figure the food can&#x27;t get in there any easier than the pick!</li>
    <li> These picks are easy to use and can be carried around in their little plastic carry case. Recommended by dentists and worth buying if you have teeth that are close together and hard to clean between. These picks are very effective in taking food particles out from between teeth and do a great job.</li>
    <li> Introduced to these by my dental hygienist.  They are pretty fabulous.  I even keep some in my purse</li>
    <li> A good product, handy and works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these soft-pics for almost a year. I was shocked when my dentist told me that I have good oral hygiene. I&#x27;ve had problems with bleeding gums, but no longer. I gently massage the gums in between the teeth. They not only remove food particles, but seem to strengthen the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little travel case is handy to keep in my purse. I keep a pack of these picks in the car, in my desk and at home.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, great product!</li>
    <li> These picks are really good for avoiding the bleeding and roughness that comes with flossing. My favorite part is that they can go through the hole from one side to the other, so you can make sure there&#x27;s nothing left between your teeth. I also really like the bristles on the end that give your teeth a clean feeling. My major complaint is that one is never enough. It takes between two to three to finish your whole mouth, so this lowers the value proposition for me because I find them a slight bit too expensive given that I have to use two or three each time. I really wish they had more rigidity, not only because then they would not break, but also to make reaching the back teeth way easier. When angling in the back of your mouth, it&#x27;s very hard to use these because they don&#x27;t have enough rigidity to go through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Soft, easy to use, and effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Wish they were more rigid/strong&lt;br /&gt;Slightly pricy</li>
    <li> These previously were great and only bent or broke occasionally. I could usually use one pick a night. Recently they got a little thinner and now break or bend constantly, usually now requiring two picks a night. This is equal to doubling the price of the product.</li>
    <li> Soft-picks have been part of our dental health for over three years.  We had run out of our original supply and were looking for more when we found them on Amazon.  Excellent and better than hard to use floss!</li>
    <li> Wonderful dental aid that comes with a nice plastic travel case to put in purse or luggage. i&#x27;m a repeat offender for this item.</li>
    <li> These are a great on the go alternative to flossing or if feeling too lazy to floss. I currently have braces, so they have become essential to my dental maintenance following meals. That said, they aren&#x27;t that sturdy. I often bend the plastic when using them if I&#x27;m not too careful about the angles i press it into my teeth with. The inability to press it to my teeth sometimes makes me worry about how effective these are compared to floss. Guess I&#x27;ll find out during my next dental appointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel cases are also pretty cheap. They don&#x27;t really stay closed well and there is a gap that a single pick can start to fall through, which can cause the case to open easier when in a bag. I have had to recollect my picks on multiple occasions from the side pocket of my gym bag. I&#x27;ve repurposed one of my cases for dental wax to replace these cases.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even use floss anymore now that I have these picks. I like the travel case for my purse.  I break some of them easily before they make it into my mouth, but that is because I am probably too rough.  They don&#x27;t break when I&#x27;m using them.</li>
    <li> My hygienist says it&#x27;s ok to floss with these.  So much easier than dentifrice!!!  AND their help with food caught between the molars is a Godsend!!!</li>
    <li> These are very good and I use them daily</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these soft-picks! They are far superior to all the other products I&#x27;ve used to reach between teeth.</li>
    <li> These are great but break too easily.</li>
    <li> These work well and are packaged conviently.  The larger outer blister pack hold three individual &amp;#34;resale size&amp;#34; packs.  The picks are quite comfortable. You can fit about 8 picks in each of the travel cases.</li>
    <li> These slide easily between molars and are especially great for cleaning the gum line next to crowned teeth.  Although the little post can bend unexpectedly at times, I find the overall flexibility to be more of a positive than a negative.</li>
    <li> These are great.  They feel good to use and they are easy to use.  They were recommended to me when I got my teeth cleaned at the dentist.  They say you can reuse them a couple times but I feel that the tip starts to bend when you do this.  Plus I don&#x27;t want to set a used one around to use later, that is not sanitary.  I thought that this package of soft picks came with all three packages of picks INSIDE OF a convenient travel case with ALL of the picks fitting in the it.  That is not the case here.  Each package of picks comes with a TINY travel case that holds only about 5 or 10 of the picks.  I do not like the packaging of the picks because the picks don&#x27;t store well in a torn package that you can&#x27;t close up.  They get scattered around easy.  Now I have to buy a container to hold the picks since the package does not work well for this.  I also thought that these were very expensive.  I wish they did not cost so much.  I think they are expensive everywhere though.</li>
    <li> Gets down in the gaps at the bottom between teeth. No need to worry about getting splinters from regular toothpicks.</li>
    <li> I love soft-picks.....</li>
    <li> The brush picks I was using before were larger and had harder bristles which hurt my gums.  These are small enough to reach into all the spaces I need to reach.  They are made of soft enough material that I don&#x27;t feel like I am hurting my gums.  They still have bristles, though.  One reviewer wrote that they are too soft to be durable, but I only use them once, so I don&#x27;t know if they could last longer.  However, I don&#x27;t think that would be very sanitary.  I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> For one who has &amp;#34;gum&amp;#34; disease, these picks are well designed to clean between the teeth and thee gum line.</li>
    <li> I am a registered dental hygienist, and I personally use these Soft-Picks, as well as recommend to my patients on a daily basis.  My only criticism is that they bend/break easily and are difficult to use from the lingual direction.  However, these are one of my favorite products.  They are somewhat pricey compared to other aids, but worth the investment.  People, please clean in between your teeth!  Becky Gray</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered. I thought the travel cases held the whole pack, but they are really small. Not too small, just smaller than I thought. These were recommended by my dentist though, and they definitely whip your gums into shape!</li>
    <li> Very convenient on the road.</li>
    <li> A truly unique product takes a little practice. Wait until you see what you can do. Add this to your routine!</li>
    <li> I will buy soft picks again. They clean between your teeth without tearing up your gums. They do not last as long as the brush type, but the gentle rubbery surface makes them very comfortable.</li>
    <li> I can carry them with me because of the size.  These picks do a wonderful job of flossing and they also help to stimulate the gums.  Love them.</li>
    <li> Somewhat disappointed in the ability of these picks to clean between teeth without bending, that hinders or prohibits these picks to clean properly. Previous, ones that I&#x27;ve purchased did not have this problem, appears that the quality is no longer up to previous standards.</li>
    <li> these get bent very easly and don&#x27;t last very long</li>
    <li> My dentist recommends these and after trying a few samples I was looking for a regular supply. Amazon had a nice selection of various sizes and softness levels, so made the shopping much more convenient than going to various retail stores. This pack contains 3 separate storage cases that will hold the picks, so I can keep one pack in my purse, one at home, and one in the office. Doesn&#x27;t get easier than that. And the price was right. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I like these better then the other brand I have been using. They still will bend if trying to force between teeth to close together but not any worse then others. Floss will get stuck and shred between tight spaces but not these. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Picks don,t seem as sturdy as in the past.  Often have to use 2 instead of one due to flimsiness</li>
    <li> I would love the product if the base didn&#x27;t bend, making me use 3 or 4 to do 1 cleaning.</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended these instead of toothpicks.</li>
    <li> This a great product for cleaning your teeth at home and on the go. It really beats using traditional floss because it so easy to use and not time consuming. And the best thing is is that there are 240 picks, which will last you a while. I plan on buying another as soon as my current set finishes.</li>
    <li> Suggested by my dentist to use between meals.  I use regular floss in the AM and in the PM before bed, I use these.</li>
    <li> We have used these picks for years.  We keep them at the dining room table and I carry a pack in my purse.  They are easy on your gums and get the stuck food out from between your teeth.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable to use and I use it darily. It has replaced the floss for my life. But it is not very durable and sometimes it is broken. But anyway, I would still recommend it.</li>
    <li> It can get between teeth that are close together. The brushes clean effectively. The price is competitive compared to other picks.</li>
    <li> Works better then any other pick. After several scary episodes when picks with wire broke off in between my teeth I tried these. You can&#x27;t always find them in the store but Amazon always has them.</li>
    <li> Since my brother brought me these from Japan several years ago, I became a convert from flossing to picking! Try it.</li>
    <li> For years my dentist gave me poor gum scores because I wasn&#x27;t flossing every day. Well my teeth are pretty tightly packed and if I can get floss between my teeth at all the resulting snap is painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these do the job much more quickly and easily. My gum scores have now been excellent for the past couple years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus, each container of 80 includes a small snap-shut travel pack. You can use it to throw a few soft-picks in your suitcase, but it is also very handy to keep from losing other tiny items like, say, those SD memory cards for your camera, or a few pins, or anything else small and loose.</li>
    <li> Not that it matters too much, but I did not receive a &amp;#34;240 pack.&amp;#34; Rather, I received three separate 80 packs and thus, not all on the same packaging as advertised. The product is terrific though, and I am so glad that I discovered Gum soft picks!</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended these. I love them. Super convenient and they are good at getting into those hard to reach places!</li>
    <li> I love this product, and I use it after every meal. It is an excellent way to promote dental health. I love that there is no metal at the tip, as sometimes with the metal ones, I have injured my gum. These are absolutely PERFECT. However, if they stop making them in GERMANY, I will not buy them anymore!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended these to add to my daily dental care. They are easy to use, really scrub between the teeth and hold up well for each use. I am 65 and have kept my gums in good shape according to my hygienist.</li>
    <li> Soft-picks work great, and in this package there are lots of them (it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re perishable, so why not stock if the price is good).</li>
    <li> i use these every day, have for years....i am 68 and take good care of my teeth, trying to make them last.  these are soft and comfortable.  love them.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I always keep them with me.</li>
    <li> I don’t use tooth picks of any kind, but after a bad trip to the dentist, I thought I would give these a try. These are little plastic picks with rubber nubs surrounding its tip. The rubber nubs don’t scratch so they are comfortable to use. To be thorough, I use them on both the inside and outside of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: At first I was having trouble using the Softpick on the inside of my mouth - the pick was to long. Then I had an epiphany - I bent the neck of the tip to a 90 degree angel so most of it was pointing out of my mouth. I had no trouble fitting the remaining horizontally inside of my mouth. I try to be careful, and so far the joint hasn’t broken off. Disclaimer - be careful if you do this - chocking hazard!</li>
    <li> I love the fact that my purchase included the cases.  I use the soft-picks daily; they are soft and cannot hurt you.  It does a very good job cleaning between teeth with larger spaces in between.  It is a welcome addition to my teeth cleaning ritual.  You still have to use floss, as I have noticed it does not clean as well as floss, therefore 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Great product. Keeps my dentist happy and me away from my dentist :) Flossing was too hard, the thread breaking between teeth etc.. With this it is very easy. The only thing I wish is that there would be a bulk box without the little plastic travel packets. I have so many of them now and it&#x27;s such a waste...</li>
    <li> Perfect for someone who wears braces.  Does excellent job cleaning between teeth.</li>
    <li> I bought two packages of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great to use and easy to slide in between the gum and teeth. It provides a nice massage to the gums while removing sediment between the teeth. My wife and I both are fans of this product and will continue to re-order once supply runs low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Ease of use, the ribbed stem to slide in between the teeth&lt;br /&gt;CONS: I gave it four stars because the product needs to be a tad more firm. The stem will break easily if not done properly.</li>
    <li> I love to put these in my mouth. Then they break and I put them on the floor of my car. Sometimes I pick them up and throw them in the trash. They mostly come out at night... mostly.</li>
    <li> The amples I got from my dentist were green &amp; worked fine (I&#x27;d have givem 5 stars for those) the ones I received were pink and bent quite easily - not as good as the green tips. What&#x27;s with the pink tips, and how can I get the green tips ?  OKAY I see they are affiliated ith breast cancer - Good for \\&quot;GUM\\&quot; I&#x27;d still rtather have had the green ones (the illustration was for  the Green  tips. I&#x27;ll keep the Pink tips for my wife and try to find the green ones other than on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was pleased until I found out that Costco was selling the identical item for 1/3 less.</li>
    <li> Great product at a reasonable price and delivered to my door ; what more can one ask for?  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> My dental assistant suggested i use these since i have permanent retainer on upper and lower teeth.  I never floss because I hate using the threader.  She gave me samples of these and I&#x27;ve never been without them.&lt;br /&gt;They are perfect for getting between your teeth and under the retainer.</li>
    <li> I love these. I recently got braces. These little tools are perfect for keeping my braces clear and getting between teeth. Useful tool for the braces crowd. Like the small travel case included, too</li>
    <li> Keep these in my Wallet</li>
    <li> The product itself works very well to clean around my bridgework plus the price per item is the lowest I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist said on my last visit that these were her newest favorite dental aid.  She gave me a little packet and I liked them.  Easy to use, gentle on the gums.  Plus you can rinse them off and reuse them - my hygienist suggested that, so it must be okay, right?</li>
    <li> I use these every day, and it makes a big difference when I see my dentist</li>
    <li> I like them a lot. They work well. If I reuse them too many times they get flimsy but that&#x27;s not a problem because I should use a new one anyway.</li>
    <li> This particular style breaks off easily?  They are pink tipped rather than the green which might be why?</li>
    <li> Good price. Haven&#x27;t found 80 count cases anywhere else for this price.</li>
    <li> I used a number of harder plastic picks from time to time - and felt like I was &amp;#34;scratching&amp;#34; my gums.  These are soft rubber with bristles.  I am never going back</li>
    <li> too soft, it keeps breaking, it did not &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; anything off .</li>
    <li> Once I tried these soft-pix, I was ready to throw away all the tiny brushes, plastic tooth picks, and other things I was using to try to keep my mouth healthy.  I have lots of gaps where food gets impacted, and these soft-pix are absolutely the best for my needs.  They don&#x27;t hurt at all, yet they are very effective.  I am able to use one of these at least a few times if I&#x27;m careful, so I was trying to make my case of 40 last a while.  When I saw this package of 240 picks for such a good price, I couldn&#x27;t resist.  I use my picks as vigorously as I please now that I have almost an 8-month supply.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Excellent for after meals to keep teeth clean.  Makes a huge difference at check up time.  Better than flossing ribbons.</li>
    <li> love them  so much easier to use than floss!</li>
    <li> My dentist turned me on to these - so much better than a tooth pick.</li>
    <li> if you are buying this product for a baby these might work for you, this product is not made for adult teeth they are way to small to work effectively. I can&#x27;t recommend this product for adult use.</li>
    <li> They work great. Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> My teeth are very close together and when I floss, the dental tape catches and tears, leaving behind small shreds, which are hard to remove! These, on the other hand, are awesome to use. My teeth feel so much better after using these, and they leave nothing behind except a clean mouth. I&#x27;d rate these 6 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> Now I don&#x27;t mind &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; !</li>
    <li> I have always used the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; type of plastic tooth picks, but these are much better on my gums and clean much better.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and they come with three small cases.</li>
    <li> On the advice of my dentist I started using this along with daily flossing.  Have had a significant reduction of gum swelling.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s to say about glorified toothpicks?  They work well.  I like the product.  They appeared in the mail as espected.  Nuff said.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have too much to say about this product.  It is what it is, but since I don&#x27;t have any complaints, I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> These are the best picks I have ever tried! Great quality and a great price. Cannot go wrong with these!</li>
    <li> Good product, but didn&#x27;t compare prices, like what Costco sells them at.</li>
    <li> Great product ! My wife is a Dental Hygienist and recommends these to her patients. Allows you to discreetly remove food without grossing everyone out.</li>
    <li> These &amp;#34;Soft-Picks&amp;#34; are great to use and carry with you in the provided travel cases.  The picks are soft yet effective as if you were using floss.  If you have crowns this helps as well.  I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Great product, great value. While most dentists would not recommend this as an alternative to flossing, I&#x27;ve found it to work quite well for this purpose. This method is easier to use and provides good results for me.</li>
    <li> These have actually saved my dental health. Started using them a year or so ago. Did not tell the dentist I was using them until he noticed a major improvement in my dental health. Here&#x27;s the scoop for me. I get told all the time to floss, floss brush brush. The real problem is that how the heck do I do that then I am eating out a lot or just simply busy. Even when I try to floss well it is messy.  I buy these, make sure to fill the enclosed plastic case and put them in the car, wallet and around the house. I know they work well because when I use the water pik there isn&#x27;t much left to clean. Highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> These are so useful and really effective. Now make an organic, compostable version and I&#x27;ll give you 5 stars!</li>
    <li> My dentist gave me a sampler of these that were great.  They had green colored prongs.  These ones are not green - they are pink and they bend and break a lot more easily.  I wish I would have received the same product my dentist gave me.</li>
    <li> Great for home or on the go.</li>
    <li> I began using these nearly two years ago. My whole life I have had two or more cavities each year. I started using these as dental floss never worked for me. I also try other products but these work the best for me. So now I use the soft picks as well as rinsing in the morning and evening with the Crest Pro Health and it has been over two years since I have had a cavity. Maybe some are happy with the floss but it never worked for me, it only got caught in my teeth and cut my gums. Thank you for this great product !</li>
    <li> very easy way to keep my daughter flossing regularly</li>
    <li> These things are awesome. My dentist thinks I am flossing daily because these are doing a great job even if only 2-3 times a week. Carry them in my purse in the tiny plastic container easily.</li>
    <li> Better than wooden tooth pics!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the soft toothpicks rather than the wooden ones.  These really work well so I purchase by the dozens when I get a good price.  They don&#x27;t last more than two uses but that is okay as they don&#x27;t damage your gums.</li>
    <li> Good price at the time.  I like the product.</li>
    <li> Works well but prefer the Wider Spaces</li>
    <li> Product came on time and was the best price around. If you use this product, this is the best deal around.</li>
    <li> my dentist recommended these</li>
    <li> Great bang for your buck. These are a necessary part of a good dental hygiene regime. Brushing, flossing, rinsing, water pick, and routine cleanings are not all you need, especially if you have tight teeth or are prone to between teeth cavities. You can&#x27;t find this quantity, and if you do the price will be much more.</li>
    <li> My dentist introduced me to these gum picks and I now I use them every day. My mouth feels cleaner afterward.</li>
    <li> These are great to use. I found these by accident and now I will not use anything else.Easy to use.</li>
    <li> These are the greatest picks, and they come with a case which is convenient.  My dentist recommended them.  Good price.</li>
    <li> Love these!  My dentist recommended them since I don&#x27;t like to floss that much.  Love them and use them all the time.  My mouth feels so clean.</li>
