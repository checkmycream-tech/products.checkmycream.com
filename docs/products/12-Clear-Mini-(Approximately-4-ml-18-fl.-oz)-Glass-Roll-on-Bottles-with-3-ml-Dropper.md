      <li>I love that the rollerballs don&#x27;t get stuck like some others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Great Product, fast shipment</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Bottles are okay, but not the easy / clean application I was expecting.</li>
      <li>Got here quickly!</li>
      <li>Got here really quick!</li>
      <li>Great for using with FCO and essential oils.</li>

      <li>Just an incredible little item!</li>
      <li>These little bottles are great for making your own essential oil blends.</li>
      <li>but I had to have them right away</li>
      <li>These are a great size for small rollers.  </li>
      <li>perfect for little essential oil blends!</li>
      <li>These roll-on lids aren&#x27;t as consistent in the amount they dispense as the larger ones, but I still think they&#x27;re great for custom blend essential oils to put in your purse.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Received exactly like advertised</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even know these magic little bottles existed but wow, so glad that I know now.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described and fast shipping</li>
      <li>I have ordered 10ml rollerballs in the past from Amazon and have been delighted.</li>
      <li>The little bottles are great to use but the rollerball constantly falls out and I end up spilling oil when they do.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>You really should make them with the metal or glass roller balls.</li>
      <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
      <li>Most important, not having to replace wasted oils !!</li>
      <li>I was excited to order this size bottle because it is smaller and lighter to carry.  </li>
      <li>If there are other caps that would fit these bottles, it would be greatly appreciated if they could be sent my way....</li>
      <li>Just right for making essential oil roller balls.</li>
      <li>All of mine came new with no residue like they were used.</li>
      <li>The rollers are too tight and do not rotate easily in their sockets.</li>
      <li>It appears there must have been a hairline crack in the bottle which I then filled with oil and coconut oil and when putting it together it cracked in half.</li>
      <li>The roller balls are a little tight and do not roll very easily</li>
      <li>but that may be due to them being brand new.</li>

<li> The roller balls are a little tight and do not roll very easily</li>
<li> but that may be due to them being brand new.</li>
<li> Unfortunately didn&#x27;t figure this out until I had filled a number of the bottles.</li>
<li> Kinda short and fat little bottles.</li>
<li> One of them was cracked, but I only need a few anyway.</li>
<li> Even so, the amount of liquid they dispense is minimal.  </li>
<li> and I can make a small amount and not feel like I am wasting the oils, especially when making them for my teenagers who lose their blends.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m hoping you will send me the other 3 for my other bottles.  </li>
<li> so instead I have to remove the top and use my finger to apply.  :(</li>
<li> Small enough for a handbag or slip in your pocket.</li>
<li> Other than that, I like your product.</li>
<li> A little disappointing because the caps don&#x27;t fit the bottles.</li>
<li> I also like to hand out blends to friends and this keeps down costs.</li>
<li> Not too big, not too small!  </li>
<li> Rollers didn&#x27;t work on half the bottles.</li>
<li> Although I feel like these bottle are large enough to fit enough essential oil blends, I was very disappointed that the roller ball was very difficult to roll!</li>
<li> These roller balls are not a good option for essential oils.</li>
<li> The roller balls fall out don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
<li> One of the bottles bottom was broken and rough.</li>
<li> Disappointed in the roller-balls, I had to try several before I could find 3 that would actually roll.  </li>
<li> ; If you are looking to try out essential oil rollers or are tired of wasting oil give this size a go!  </li>
<li> The rollerball has literally &amp;#34;fallen&amp;#34; out of 3 of the 5 bottles that I have used so far and the liquid contents destroyed one garment and my briefcase :(.</li>
<li> makes it very difficult, and even actually hurt!</li>
<li> Not good at all.  </li>
<li> The plastic balls would not roll and it&#x27;s frustrating.</li>
<li> Disappointed.</li>
<li> Very unhappy.</li>
<li> Horrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The bottles are great!</li>
    <li> these are nice rollers and cheaper then what you find else where. but it does seem the the roller ball tends to stick a bit sometimes.</li>
    <li> These are a great buy for the money. The roller balls are a little tight and do not roll very easily but that may be due to them being brand new.</li>
    <li> I bought the larger size bottles as well.  These roll-on lids aren&#x27;t as consistent in the amount they dispense as the larger ones, but I still think they&#x27;re great for custom blend essential oils to put in your purse.</li>
    <li> love using them for oils</li>
    <li> One of the bottles bottom was broken and rough. Otherwise, a good bottle!</li>
    <li> Although I feel like these bottle are large enough to fit enough essential oil blends, I was very disappointed that the roller ball was very difficult to roll! I use the roller ball bottles to run essential oils on my neck and forehead when I get headaches and having to use these roller ball bottles makes it very difficult, and even actually hurt!</li>
    <li> Received exactly like advertised</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like these work - the rollers don&#x27;t actually roll so instead I have to remove the top and use my finger to apply.  :(</li>
    <li> Horrible. I sent them back</li>
    <li> These are what I needed but I only received 9 roller balls.  I&#x27;m hoping you will send me the other 3 for my other bottles.  also shorted on the 24 bottles I purchased</li>
    <li> Great Product, fast shipment</li>
    <li> more than 1/2 of the rollers don&#x27;t work.  Very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for my essential oil mixes. I love that the rollerballs don&#x27;t get stuck like some others I&#x27;ve tried. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Nice size, good quality and easy to use.  Vivaplex is a great company and I enjoy their products. Great for using with FCO and essential oils. I would recommend these to anyone using essential oils.</li>
    <li> Disappointed in the roller-balls, I had to try several before I could find 3 that would actually roll.  Even so, the amount of liquid they dispense is minimal.  Several I could not get to move at all, others only move with lots of effort.  Does not work at all for my purpose of applying diluted essential oils.  Bottles are okay, but not the easy / clean application I was expecting.</li>
    <li> love the bottles for my oil give aways.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price. Got here quickly!</li>
    <li> These are a great size for small rollers.  I am so happy that I found them</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and fast shipping</li>
    <li> I have ordered 10ml rollerballs in the past from Amazon and have been delighted. I was excited to order this size bottle because it is smaller and lighter to carry.  The downside is that the ball in this rollerball seems to be a glass ball in a plastic casing. The rollerball has literally &amp;#34;fallen&amp;#34; out of 3 of the 5 bottles that I have used so far and the liquid contents destroyed one garment and my briefcase :(.</li>
    <li> They will do the job!</li>
    <li> Perfect for dispensing my oil without losing any.</li>
    <li> Not good at all.  The balls don&#x27;t roll. One already broke. Very unhappy.And now all the balls have fallen out. I want my money back.</li>
    <li> Just right for making essential oil roller balls.</li>
    <li> You really should make them with the metal or glass roller balls. The plastic balls would not roll and it&#x27;s frustrating. Ijust had to order replacement roller balls. Other than that, I like your product.</li>
    <li> Love these rollerball bottles! All of mine came new with no residue like they were used. All of the ones I have used have no issue with the roller ball attachments. They all work wonderfully! I would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> The balls don&#x27;t move too freely. You have to use some effort apply product.</li>
    <li> The roller balls did not work at all!!!!</li>
    <li> The little bottles are great to use but the rollerball constantly falls out and I end up spilling oil when they do.&lt;br /&gt;I have to make sure to hold the bottle right side up when applying with the rollerball.</li>
    <li> These are nice. I thought they&#x27;d be a bit skinnier  though. Kinda short and fat little bottles. One of them was cracked, but I only need a few anyway. Got here really quick!</li>
    <li> A great quality product for the price!  Love this!</li>
    <li> These little bottles are great for making your own essential oil blends. Small enough for a handbag or slip in your pocket. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> perfect for little essential oil blends!</li>
    <li> I use these to put my cologne in from bigger bottles  to take with me in my purse. I just spray some in there and good to go.</li>
    <li> Perfect for mixing essential oils together and take with you while traveling.</li>
    <li> My costly essential oils leaked out of the bottles. Not just one bottle, all of them. I lost more money on the replacing of my oils, than these bottles cost.  If I need a glass bottle with a roller ball for dispensing, I  now buy a 3 -5 ml amber with the metal roller ball.  They are more costly, but we&#x27;ll worth the price difference.  Most important, not having to replace wasted oils !!</li>
    <li> These roller balls are not a good option for essential oils. They don&#x27;t roll and apply well at all. Of course I can&#x27;t return them because I&#x27;ve used one. I definitely won&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> Does just what its suppose to. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great quality and they work great. Great Customer Service!!!</li>
    <li> The roller balls fall out don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> These are my new favorite roller bottle size!!! Not too big, not too small!  Like Goldilocks&#x27; said &amp;#34;Just right!&amp;#34; If you are looking to try out essential oil rollers or are tired of wasting oil give this size a go!  I like them because they travel well and I can make a small amount and not feel like I am wasting the oils, especially when making them for my teenagers who lose their blends.  I also like to hand out blends to friends and this keeps down costs.</li>
    <li> The rollers are too tight and do not rotate easily in their sockets. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even know these magic little bottles existed but wow, so glad that I know now. These are going to be my &amp;#34;go to gifts&amp;#34; for everyone. I&#x27;ve mixed lotions in them and they smell heavenly ... I&#x27;ve mixed essential oils in them. Just an incredible little item!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> they are truelly mini.</li>
    <li> Rollers didn&#x27;t work on half the bottles. I would&#x27;ve sent them back but I had to have them right away</li>
    <li> A little disappointing because the caps don&#x27;t fit the bottles. Unfortunately didn&#x27;t figure this out until I had filled a number of the bottles. If there are other caps that would fit these bottles, it would be greatly appreciated if they could be sent my way....</li>
    <li> the roller balls don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> I had one bottle break in my hand and cut my thumb while twisting the cap on.  It appears there must have been a hairline crack in the bottle which I then filled with oil and coconut oil and when putting it together it cracked in half.</li>
    <li> Bottles are nice. But the rollers don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Great product!!  Works well for oils.</li>
