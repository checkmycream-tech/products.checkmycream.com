      <li>does not have a nice smell at all.  </li>
      <li>Although Bumble &amp; Bumble has a good name, I am not at all pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>A Good treatment for a healthy hair, the smells its nice too.</li>
      <li>First off, the conditioner doesn&#x27;t smell very good.  </li>
      <li>In fact, the more I use it, the more I despise the smell!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very important to have a quality conditioner</li>
      <li>It does a fine job of moisturizing, and it smells nice .</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I usually love bumble and bumble</li>
      <li>and I am always pleased with the results</li>
      <li>Like I say it&#x27;s ok, but</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
      <li>Using this conditioner I am able to put a brush through it.  </li>
      <li>This is not an authentic B&amp;B product...</li>
      <li>- I love how this product smells.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t detest it like Creme de Coco, nor love it like the Color Support or Pureology&#x27;s Nanoworks.</li>
      <li>So many you have to use almost 1/2 the bottle to get it on all the hairs, but this 1 you put it on, leave it on for @</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very rich and creamy.</li>
      <li>Pretty good.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing and has really good detangling elements to it.</li>
      <li>The Super Rich makes his hair \\&quot;nice and soft\\&quot; now.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lastly, it rinses easily w/o residue.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend this product to any and everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is amazing, and my hair gets so clean and fresh after using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But, in my opinion this is ideal for people that have very-very dry hair.  </li>
      <li>She told me she knew people who use the Super Rich and love it.</li>
      <li>I moved to Indiana where none was available.  </li>
      <li>worth the price for sure.</li>
      <li>It smells nice but leaves my hair very tangled and stringy.</li>
      <li>After one time using it my hair feels fabulous.  </li>
      <li>The Bumble &amp; Bumble Gentle Shampoo/Super Rich Conditioner is the best thing that&#x27;s happened to my hair in a long time.</li>
      <li>, that is pretty healthy despite all those things.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Bumble &amp; Bumble super rich conditioner for years.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Bb Super Rich conditioner for years</li>
      <li>What I received is NOT Bumble and Bumble Super Rich Conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Bumble and Bumble Super Rich Conditioner for over 10 years.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the super rich conditioner.</li>
      <li>Nothing could compare to Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s Gentle Shampoo and Super Rich Conditioner!  </li>
      <li>I am suprised how quick</li>
      <li>I am a PROUD Black Women who needs products that are not drying to my hair.  </li>
      <li>Exactly, luxury for my hair!</li>
      <li>You might watch out though if you skip a day between washes because the conditioner is really rich and can make your hair look a little greasy/slept in style(which works well with wavy hair) but probably not too good with straight fine hair.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;re returning it and have since ordered directly from Bumble &amp; Bumble to ensure authentic product.  </li>
      <li>sometimes i add product, but it&#x27;s for fun, not because i have to.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love Bumble and Bumble extra rich conditioners.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t look right or smell right.</li>
      <li>a really gentle (perhaps even non-sulfate) shampoo - there&#x27;s nothing special about the shampoo they pair with this.</li>
      <li>It simply doesn&#x27;t have that B &amp; B smell nor does it do the same great things for my hair.  </li>
      <li>(when you&#x27;re actually getting the true contents) is a fine product - 5* in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I have tried many big name, expensive shampoos and conditioners, and this is THE BEST.</li>
      <li>I will get through this bottle, and most likely not repurchase.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this product in California.  </li>
      <li>I have been using b and b for years, this conditioner is worth every penny, and you don&#x27;t have to use as much or as often as the store bought conditioners.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many \\&quot;moisturing\\&quot; shampoos and conditioners but was always still left with frizz.</li>
      <li>Love this deep conditioner.</li>
      <li>I have never received this many compliments on my hair on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
      <li>My hair is soft and smooth after rinse.</li>
      <li>This is my second bottle of Super Rich Conditioner.</li>
      <li>I have a very sensitive scalp and allergic to many different things in hair products.</li>
      <li>Another great fact it lasts forever as you only need a little bit.</li>
      <li>I have highlights and lowlights, and most shampoos and conditioners leave my hair looking dry and frizzy, or too flat and heavy, but this B and B is great.</li>
      <li>I really feel like I am not wasting my money and that I am getting a well thought out, and manufactured</li>
      <li>I pair the conditioner with [[ASIN:B000BIXP3A Bumble and Bumble Gentle Shampoo, 8-Ounce Bottle]].  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ready to style immediately.</li>
      <li>but it was the real stuff- and not expired.</li>
      <li>So, I decided to not be cheap and just spend the extra money and try it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product for every day use. Makes my hair shiny. Another great fact it lasts forever as you only need a little bit. Would recommend for people with colored hair.</li>
    <li> does not have a nice smell at all.  In fact, the more I use it, the more I despise the smell!</li>
    <li> I am a devout Amazon.com customer as well as Bumble &amp; Bumble customer so I was greatly disappointed by this Super Rich conditioner product.  It simply doesn&#x27;t have that B &amp; B smell nor does it do the same great things for my hair.  It really seems to be a different product in a B &amp; B container...</li>
    <li> just like the shampoo, this is the best conditioner i&#x27;ve ever used.  it is perfect for my hair type and lasts a long time, as i only need to use such a small amount.  worth the price for sure.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo and conditioner from my salon. It smells nice but leaves my hair very tangled and stringy. I used it all to get my money&#x27;s worth but have been anxious to get my old pureology back. I would not recommend this product.  It takes twice as long to brush my hair out after using and it&#x27;s just awful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of conditioners, but this 1 is by far the best!&lt;br /&gt;First, you only need about size of quarter for long hair; my hair is about 2\\&quot; past shoulders in length.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it works. So many you have to use almost 1/2 the bottle to get it on all the hairs, but this 1 you put it on, leave it on for @ a minute&#x3D;shave legs, or bathe rest body.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, it rinses easily w/o residue. I just try not to OVER rinse it so I still have some working in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;5* all the way.&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; Miracle Leave in Product. Need @ 4 sprays, does wonders!&lt;br /&gt;Both of these products you can get for amazing $ going through Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have curly dry, course hair.  Using this conditioner I am able to put a brush through it.  My hair in  shiney, and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Most conditioners leave my hair dry.  Unless your hair is very dry this product might leave your hair  over conditioned.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product in California.  I moved to Indiana where none was available.  I tried switching to other brands...  Nothing could compare to Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s Gentle Shampoo and Super Rich Conditioner!  I had to order it directly from the company for three years until a solon nearby finally discovered the product and is selling it to their customers.</li>
    <li> This was NOT authentic product.I have used it for years,it has a terrible smell and the lid seemed to be glued on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay conditioner, but for me not fabulous. It does a fine job of moisturizing, and it smells nice . I like the texture, and all, but it just doesn&#x27;t quite do IT for me, not enough to spend the money on this product. I don&#x27;t detest it like Creme de Coco, nor love it like the Color Support or Pureology&#x27;s Nanoworks. I will get through this bottle, and most likely not repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t quite hydrating enough, and it doesn&#x27;t give my hair as much shine and movement as I like. Like I say it&#x27;s ok, but not my HG.It does no harm.... I have highlighted, long, wavy hair, that is pretty healthy despite all those things.</li>
    <li> I purchased a case of bumble and bumble products through Amazon. Not only was it shipped in shoddy newspaper, but the contents of the Bumble &amp; Bumble Gentle Shampoo and Conditioner smell and feel NOTHING like that which I buy from Bumble and Bumble in NY.  It makes me wonder if someone in the middle isn&#x27;t messing with the contents.  I tried contacting Amazon to complain, with no luck.  I recommend buying from a salon that you know and trust as the product (when you&#x27;re actually getting the true contents) is a fine product - 5* in my opinion.</li>
    <li> this is the best product that bumble and bumble makes. before i started using this conditioner i felt depressed whenever i had my hair down, it was frizzy on the ends and ended up in a triangle shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this conditioner is very heavy. but with curly long hair, it is necessary - it weighs down the curls, while making them silky and soft. i hate post-shower products that change the texture of your hair, so it&#x27;s great that this is pretty much all i need to tame my hair. sometimes i add product, but it&#x27;s for fun, not because i have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;use a really gentle (perhaps even non-sulfate) shampoo - there&#x27;s nothing special about the shampoo they pair with this. also consider going without shampoo entirely, at least occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note: this conditioner is not for your roots. it is for the ends of your hair only.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bumble and Bumble for about 8 yrs. Lately I&#x27;ve been mixing some condition with the shampoo &amp; I like the results. A quality product with a great scent.</li>
    <li> Previous to this brand, I was using Pantene because it was cheap and worked better than other under $10 brands. However, I have longer, semi-coarse thick hair and it ALWAYS felt really dry and brittle. I had tons of split ends. I decided to ask a friend of mine with beautiful, glossy hair what she used. Which, oddly enough, isn&#x27;t this conditioner, but she does use Bumble products. This one is just too heavy for her fine hair. She told me she knew people who use the Super Rich and love it. So, I decided to not be cheap and just spend the extra money and try it. I love it! I&#x27;m NEVER going back to Pantene again! My hair no longer feels dry and brittle, I haven&#x27;t noticed any split ends and it smells good. Also, my boyfriend who never conditioned his hair because it made it \\&quot;too greasy\\&quot; loves this. The Super Rich makes his hair \\&quot;nice and soft\\&quot; now. This stuff is the best!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Super Rich Conditioner. It has managed to edge out all my other rinse-out conditioners, now its the only one I use. I have curly, dry, frizzy hair, and this conditioner actually helps without leaving my hair feeling waxy and heavy.</li>
    <li> I love Bumble and Bumble extra rich conditioners. With hair like mine it&#x27;s very important to have a quality conditioner and I am always pleased with the results</li>
    <li> I purchased the super rich conditioner. It didn&#x27;t look right or smell right. I had a little left in my old bottle and compared the products (old bottle was purchased from B&amp;B site) and they were NOT the same. I was ripped off!</li>
    <li> I usually love bumble and bumble but this product is not worth the money! Makes my hair look&lt;br /&gt;Greasy! Save your money and go with another bumble and bumble product. Coco creme is great!</li>
    <li> I pair the conditioner with [[ASIN:B000BIXP3A Bumble and Bumble Gentle Shampoo, 8-Ounce Bottle]].  Taken as a pair, I have three things to say:&lt;br /&gt; - I love how this product smells.  It invigorates me.&lt;br /&gt; - I have never received this many compliments on my hair on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt; - It has saved my very processed hair--instead of dry and breaking, my hair is soft and silky!</li>
    <li> My wife love this shampoo and that is saying something!</li>
    <li> I have rather wavy hair that is inherently dry for no reason. I&#x27;ve tried many \\&quot;moisturing\\&quot; shampoos and conditioners but was always still left with frizz. The Bumble &amp; Bumble Gentle Shampoo/Super Rich Conditioner is the best thing that&#x27;s happened to my hair in a long time. I&#x27;ve tried other B&amp;B combos and this is my favorite. It cleans and moisturizes so that I can even let my hair air dry and it still looks great. You might watch out though if you skip a day between washes because the conditioner is really rich and can make your hair look a little greasy/slept in style(which works well with wavy hair) but probably not too good with straight fine hair.</li>
    <li> I have highlights and lowlights, and most shampoos and conditioners leave my hair looking dry and frizzy, or too flat and heavy, but this B and B is great. I have tried many big name, expensive shampoos and conditioners, and this is THE BEST. The shampoo is just as good as the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have been using b and b for years, this conditioner is worth every penny, and you don&#x27;t have to use as much or as often as the store bought conditioners.  I just ran out and bought a store brand, and my hair is tangly and frizzy.  I am suprised how quick I forget how great this stuff is until I stop using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Bumble and Bumble Super Rich Conditioner for over 10 years.  I purchased a bottle from &amp;#34;Winebrook Products&amp;#34; on September 10, 2013.  What I received is NOT Bumble and Bumble Super Rich Conditioner.  It is a fraudulent product packaged to appear to the buyer as shown in the picture. Please heed this review and BEWARE.</li>
    <li> The conditioner is also a moisture based product which is AWESOME for curly or kinky hair.  I am a PROUD Black Women who needs products that are not drying to my hair.  I strongly recommend this product to any and everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Bumble and Bumble</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner. Completely conditions hair leaving it soft without weighing it down, this is my new HG conditioner!!!!!!</li>
    <li> A little pricey, but well worth the money. A little goes a long way. I swim everyday during the summer and probably 3-4 times a week in the winter. This conditioner works great for swimmers&#x27; hair.</li>
    <li> This is not an authentic B&amp;B product...the consistency and smell was completely off. I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing!</li>
    <li> This little bottle goes a long way. It&#x27;s good quality too. It&#x27;s not great but still can be purchased at this price</li>
    <li> LOVE bumble &amp; bumble products!</li>
    <li> Smelled bad,did nothing but damage my hair.I have been using Bumble and Bumble for years. I knew instantly it was&#x27;t what it was represented to be.Very disappointing</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and has really good detangling elements to it.I have a very sensitive scalp and allergic to many different things in hair products.This conditioner has been a life saver ( well it has kept me from having a red,itchy scalp)!</li>
    <li> Product was so-so; not worth the price.  Didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference in the war on frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> ...and SUPER EXPENSIVE, in a smaller bottle!  However, I don&#x27;t use as much because it is concentrated.  I just don&#x27;t believe I can afford it too often, or justify the amount I have to spend to have it.</li>
    <li> This was not real Bumble and Bumble ! I had my hair colorist check it out and she was shocked Amazon let&#x27;s this product be sold on their website! The smell and texture were not the same as the bottle she showed me that she bought at license only beauty supply.  I should have read the reviews before I ordered it, Don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
    <li> Although Bumble &amp; Bumble has a good name, I am not at all pleased with this product.  It leaves a yellow cast to my usually shiny gray and silver hair, which is impossible to remove!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly never purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> Exactly, luxury for my hair! Smells great and feels amazing on my hair. Really expensive tho, so I use it for special occasions</li>
    <li> Love this deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bumble &amp; Bumble super rich conditioner for years.  This is not it.  I am so angry.  Both the texture and smell are different, and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel the same at all. I can&#x27;t believe I spent money on this. Don&#x27;t spend yours.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s expensive, yes, but worth the money.  I really feel like I am not wasting my money and that I am getting a well thought out, and manufactured product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is amazing, and my hair gets so clean and fresh after using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Bumble &amp; Bumble but I was a bit disappointed with this conditioner.  First off, the conditioner doesn&#x27;t smell very good.  Yes, the texture is thick and rich and even after rinsing makes your hair feel smooth.  But, in my opinion this is ideal for people that have very-very dry hair.  If your hair is not super dry, this product may moisturize too much.  My hair feels great after I blow-dry it but I notice by the end of the day, my hair is almost oily.  If you do use this product, use a very small amount and work it in prior to rinsing.</li>
    <li> Being a guy, I never really thought about hair products at all. After I let my hair get a bit long, I realized I had to take care of it, lest I look like a pathetic, future-less bum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner does the trick, period. Never in my life did I even imagine a that there exists a product that can make my hair look and feel this awesome. Seriously. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> Always a little wary of buying this kind of product online but it was the real stuff- and not expired.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair. My color processed and bleached hair is so revived with this deep conditioner. Its the only conditioner I use. Once a week I condition with out rising and cover with a plastic cap. I blow dry over the cap for 10 minutes. My hair is soft and smooth after rinse. Wonderful treatment!!</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used to deal with my curly, frizzy hair. It&#x27;s very rich and creamy. When I get out of the shower, I can run my wide tooth comb right through my hair with no tangles. I&#x27;m ready to style immediately.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because the slaon I went to used it and I liked the way my hair felt.</li>
    <li> Great product. Cannot purchase locally.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair smelling amazing!</li>
    <li> I just won this from my health club. It is so amazing.  After one time using it my hair feels fabulous.  It is like a new head of baby softy hair!  I&#x27;m in love.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. I have dry hair (Asian, straight) and I&#x27;m always looking for a good nourishing conditioner that at the same time does not weigh down my hair. This one does the nourishing, but is a little too heavy for the summer months (it weighs down hair) but is great for the winter months.</li>
    <li> Love B &amp; B!  This is a wonderful Product!</li>
    <li> A Good treatment for a healthy hair, the smells its nice too. Its my second purchase of this product. I trully recommend</li>
    <li> I have used Bumble and Bumble Super Rich Conditioner in the past, and the product I received from Amazon was NOT it. When compared side by side to the actual Bumble and Bumble conditioner, the conditioner I received was soupy and smelled totally different (like Herbal Essences).  If you are going to spend the money on this product, I would suggest ordering it from the manufacturer&#x27;s website and not from Amazon. This was a scam.</li>
    <li> I knew something was off when I started using this product. I have been using Bb Super Rich conditioner for years and I was surprised by the contents of this bottle. I thought maybe they had reformulated their product. I finally finished the bottle and replaced it with one purchased from a salon. It was immediately obvious that there had been no reformulation and the product I purchased from Amazon was a fake. BEWARE.</li>
    <li> this is a great product. used every day with great results. i am a repeat customer and will continue to buy it</li>
    <li> This Bumble &amp; Bumble conditioner is great.  My wife loves it and I use it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We previously bought it from a Bumble &amp; Bumble member salon, and when it was almost gone, ordered a new bottle on Amazon from \\&quot;TodaysValues\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the bottle we received was a counterfeit product, not authentic.  It smelled different, was thinner, felt different, and the printing on the bottle was clearly inferior to an authentic bottle.  We&#x27;re returning it and have since ordered directly from Bumble &amp; Bumble to ensure authentic product.  Very disappointed in the seller (or they were duped), but Amazon&#x27;s return process is great, and the authentic product is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll stick to buying from Bumble &amp; Bumble from now on rather than take our chances.</li>
