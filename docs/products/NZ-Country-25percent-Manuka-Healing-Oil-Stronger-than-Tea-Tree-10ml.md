      <li>/&gt;75% Cosmetic Grade Sweet Almond Oil - Similar to Olive Oil</li>
      <li>In my opinion, this shouldn&#x27;t be advertised as Manuka oil at all, seeing as it is actually &amp;#34;75% cosmetic grade SWEET ALMOND OIL&amp;#34;.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m astonished at how well this stuff works. Need to order more.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I get the pure Manuka Oil from the same Vendor, but for massage oil this is amazing. I love Lemon Myrtle Oil and Sweet Almond Oil so this couldn&#x27;t be better for me.</li>
    <li> This oil is great to use with other essential oils on problem areas. Great for dry skin patches, or to be used in a massage. Has a very strong smell, and absorbs very fast.</li>
    <li> I am from New Zealand so that strong plant smell reminds me of New Zealand and the bush smells. But beside that , This mix of Manuka oil , Sweet Almond Oil, Lemon Myrtle and Lavender oil is less pungent than the 100% manuka and is nice where less strength is needed. I put it in raw shea butter and it is lovely.</li>
    <li> Manuka is New Zealand&#x27;s most abundant shrub or small tree. It is a bushy plant with small spiky leaves that bears white or pink flowers. It is fast growing and has leaves rich in oil. The essential oil is found in little pockets inside the leaves, which are broken to release the aroma. The leaves are wild harvested from naturally regenerating stands of Manuka and the oil is then slowly extracted through steam distillation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;22% Pure Undiluted Manuka Essential Oil - Studies have shown that Manuka Oil may help in the treatment of a broad spectrum of health conditions. It has anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral, anti-septic and anti-inflammatory properties. The main components of this oil are caryophyllene, geraniol, pinene, humulene, linalol and leptospermone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1% Lemon Myrtle Oil - Lemon myrtle has a powerful lemon scent. It&#x27;s even stronger than lemon essential oil. The fresh aroma is calming and uplifting, which may help clear the mind to enhance concentration or promote a peaceful night&#x27;s sleep. When diffused, the oil purifies the air and combats micro-organisms including bacteria and viruses. Lemon Myrtle Oil is the most antiseptic, antiviral, antifungal of the Australian essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1% Lavender Oil - Lavender Oil has a calming effect which may aid in relaxation and the reduction of anxiety and stress. It can also be used as an antiseptic and pain reliever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1% Tea Tree Oil - Tea Tree Oil is an excellent natural remedy for hundreds of bacterial and fungal skin conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;75% Cosmetic Grade Sweet Almond Oil - Similar to Olive Oil, Sweet Almond Oil improves the spreadability of creams, lotions and other oils. It&#x27;s a great moisturizing oil and enhances the skin, leaving it smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price to test in exchange for my honest review. This product has so many uses, it makes it hard to pass up. It&#x27;s a really great product to keep on hand. I would definitely recommend this!y recommend this!</li>
    <li> The product is only 22% pure Manuka oil. This constitutes false advertising. Although in the description it says it is 22% Manuka and 3% other essential oils, the title of the product is false and misleading. Also, it smells a bit off, I think due to the 75% almond oil. In my opinion $9-10 is a rip off for this product which contains very little actual Manuka oil.</li>
    <li> So far so good, using for a couple of toenails.  We shall see..thanks ;-)</li>
    <li> Okay, used daily but I didn&#x27;t notice a change in anything</li>
    <li> Oil arrived as expected. This was the first time I had ordered Manuka oil and I have been very pleased with this oil. For the price and the fact that the description stated it was only 25%  I was not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised.  I have used it so far in 2 healing salves, one for veterinary purposes and one for a skin infection that occurred after poison sumac. Both salves were effective in healing. I would certainly order this oil again.</li>
    <li> Oustanding oil...works great for all kinds of skin issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been into young living essential oils, and thieves oil is my go-to for infection/sickness/bacteria. Somehow I got a small area of staph infection on my thigh, and I applied this manuka oil, and lemongrass essential oil, and in 1 week it was dried up and almost gone, and did not spread anywhere else. I never like taking traditional antibiotics because they have an adverse affect on our bodies. This manuka oil really does help with infections on skin! If you&#x27;re looking for staph infection cure that&#x27;s natural, this is definitely it.</li>
    <li> Poweful stuff, needed to cut  with carrier oil due to strengh.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I got this to help with some toenail fungus. I clipped my nails way down and have used this for a few weeks and it looks like this stubborn problem may be finally under control.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I thought this was pure Manuka oil. I now see it says &#x27;25% Manuka oil&#x27;- although the actual bottle says its &amp;#34;22%&amp;#34;. In my opinion, this shouldn&#x27;t be advertised as Manuka oil at all, seeing as it is actually &amp;#34;75% cosmetic grade SWEET ALMOND OIL&amp;#34;. The other ingredients are Lemon Myrtle Oil (1%), Tea Tree Oil (1%) and Lavender Oil (1%) - in case you were wondering.&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27; t understand why it says Organic, going from the ingredients list on the bottle NOTHING ABOUT THIS IS ORGANIC. I don&#x27;t like leaving bad reviews, but I am extremely disappointed with this purchase. I hope I can return it or exchange it for actual MANUKA oil as opposed to a tiny bottle of sweet almond oil.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price, works well &amp; isnt super strong scented. Its very similar to Tea Tree Oil. Depending on what you plan to use this oil for makes the difference in whether you should purchase this product or go with a stronger antibacterial/antifungal type oil. Reasonable price. Item arrived quickly, packaged well, &amp; was in perfect condition upon opening package. Sometimes these oils can open slightly during shipping&amp; end up leaking out but not this one. I would recommend this product to friends&amp; I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely astonishing how well it works. I bought it to help with some stubborn blemishes. I used it at night, and in the morning, voila! blemishes much improved. I also put it on a bad burn on my knuckle and it has healed it almost completely when neosporin didn&#x27;t.  Much gentler than 100% tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> It did start to get rid of the fungal infection quite quickly. However, I can&#x27;t stand the smell of it.  Every time I used it I would start dry heaving.  If the fungal infection was on my feet I probably wouldn&#x27;t have been so affected but the infection is on my neck and so I had to smell this stuff constantly.  Used two days and stopped because of the smell.</li>
    <li> Cleared up a spot  on the foot that was not healing within 1 week of using this! Is also helping psoriasis areas!</li>
    <li> works fast,,my nails are nice and clearer.</li>
    <li> For centuries, the Maori people of New Zealand have been relying on a particular tree for therapeutic purposes. It is called the Manuka tree and its oil is useful in treating a wide variety of illnesses – from fevers to skin disorders. Manuka oil is extracted from the leaves, seeds, and branches of this medicinal tree. Even before being extracted, this essential oil is able to manifest its potency, protecting the tree from natural enemies such as insects, fungi, and bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a massage oil, Manuka oil benefits the mind and body through the promotion of relaxation and calmness. It can ease anxiety, stress, anger, nervous afflictions, and emotional disturbances.

    <li> I bought this to aid in the healing of a deep cut on my finger which had nine stitches. Once the stitches were removed, I started using it to keep the skin soft so that it heals quicker. It&#x27;s working great and also helps relieve the intense itching from the healing process. A nice discovery along the way is that it&#x27;s doing wonderful things for my cuticles!  Anxious to see what else it will work for!</li>
    <li> I did not see to much different in my face I prefer to use tea tree oil with water more effective in my skin.</li>
    <li> Did not help for eczema at all.  Maybe made it worse.</li>
    <li> Love this oil and use it as a cuticle oil. It arrived quickly and well packaged. Would order again.</li>
    <li> It works pretty good as a topical antibiotic but the smell is loud and not so pleasant. I had to use it at bedtime. I intended to get 100% manuka but accidentally selected this one, but it works.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for healing minor skin irritations naturally</li>
    <li> same thing,dont work as people claim</li>
    <li> For the last several summers I have been too ashamed of my feet to wear open toe sandles and as you know summer outfit are not complete unless your wearing an open toe shoe.  I had wasted too many dollars on over the counter anti fungal products and I just gave up on improving the appearance of my feet. But then, quite by accident, I ran across this, I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. In fact I ordered several anti fungal products fiquiring that I would give it my best shot. Well this came in the mail first and I put one drop on all my toes even though the fungus was really only bad on the first two. I did this every night and in as little as two days I thought I could see a difference but didn&#x27;t want to believe it . I have been using this every night now for two weeks and OMG, I wish I had taken before and after photos because  you would have too see it to believe it. The fungus is almost gone and in fact some of the other products arrived but I don&#x27;t want to interupt my progress so I&#x27;m sticking to this. Oh and by the way I also purchased the manicure set and I highly recommend that you do too because you will need those instuments to remove all the funus as it lossens up.  Watch out summer.</li>
