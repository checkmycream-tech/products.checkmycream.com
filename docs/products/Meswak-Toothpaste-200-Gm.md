      <li>love the licorice  taste and</li>
      <li>It is supposed to be made with multiple Ayurvedic herbs which are very good for the teeth.</li>

      <li>The flavor is fine.</li>
      <li>Some of the herbal toothpastes are fine, others are too abrasive but this seems fine</li>

      <li>Overall its a great toothpaste good for teeth natural product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definately worth the cost!</li>
      <li>Although I will more than likely be finished with this tube before the date, it  would have been nice to have received a fresher product from the vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
      <li>the clean feeling it gives my mouth .</li>
      <li>certainly felt better than they had for some time.</li>
      <li>My whole family have been using Dabur&#x27;s Meswak toothpaste for quite number of year, and we absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Just a nice foamy toothpaste with a nice licorice taste very mild and not very minty at all, if you have sensitivity this is supposed to be great for that, I personally use all types of dental products to get relief from over sensitive gums, and I have used similar types of toothpaste before.</li>

      <li>I rate the not being able to leave the headline or comment blank feature 1 star.</li>
      <li>I cannot say for sure that it will be better for gums than a typical sensitive teeth toothpaste, which may be useful.</li>
      <li>The Meswak tastes like cinnamon to me which is quite pleasant in contrasts to another natural product, Neem leaf powder, which tastes bitter like tobacco.</li>
      <li>Works really well.</li>
      <li>But I would add this may seem like an unusual flavor, if you&#x27;re used to mint.</li>
      <li>I will absolutely buy it again.</li>
      <li>It is an important precursor to many other chemical compounds, especially for polymers.</li>
      <li>/&gt;In view of its widespread use, toxicity and volatility, exposure to formaldehyde is a significant consideration for human health.[4]</li>
      <li>We first tried this toothpaste while travelling in India and found that it left our teeth feeling extremely clean and shiny, far more so than the usual brands.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Meswak, non-fluoridated toothpaste to anyone concerned about the dangers of fluoride.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Meswak is very medicinal if you suffer from sensitive or bleeding gums.</li>
      <li>I purchased it here on Amazon from this vendor, and after using it for about a week, I like it so far.</li>
      <li>I think some of these overseas products still contain some natural ingredients that promote healing of gums.</li>
      <li>I found  this Meswak toothpaste in a grocery store in Calgary that serves mainly the South Asian community.</li>
      <li>I will return this  product for a refund in the near future.</li>
      <li>Why worry about small ingredient in a toothpaste when we have global warming, uv rays and all other harmful stuff around us that give more harm than this.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I like to try products such as toothpaste, soap shaving preparations and shampoo that I find in stores in countries I visit on business. I found  this Meswak toothpaste in a grocery store in Calgary that serves mainly the South Asian community. It is an excellent toothpaste, tastes great (anise flavour)and you will find that your mouth is refreshed and gums feel better mine certainly felt better than they had for some time. I think some of these overseas products still contain some natural ingredients that promote healing of gums. I will absolutely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I read about this toothpaste being so great for teeth and gums, but never could find it in stores....and I&#x27;m in Los Angeles!&lt;br /&gt;I love the licorice  taste and the clean feeling it gives my mouth .</li>
    <li> As if anything from that country should ever be placed in your mouth to begin with. This garbage has caused me all kinds of dental issues. I&#x27;ve had several root canals performed each on the same 5 back teeth. This garbage has formaldehyde in it and a number of other deadly toxic poisons which should never be placed in a human mouth. Read the other reviews on this page and don&#x27;t ever use any health product from India. It is a 4&#x27;th world country plagued with famine where ancient diseases such as leprosy are still common.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calcium Carbonate, Sorbitol, Water, Silica, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate,Flavor, Miswak Extract,Cellulose Gum, Carrageenan, Sodium Silicate,Sodium Saccharin, Formaldehyde. All known toxins, very bad for your health, cancer causing, deadly.</li>
    <li> When I squeezed the tube toothpaste came out.  Honestly i just wanted to rate this 4 stars and go.  I rate the not being able to leave the headline or comment blank feature 1 star.</li>
    <li> My daughter brought a tube of Meswak toothpaste home from India as a joke for her younger brother who is a reluctant toothbrusher. He loved it!    It&#x27;s expensive to buy this way but he is brushing daily. It&#x27;s definately worth the cost! (And cheaper than round trip air to Hydrabad!)</li>
    <li> I did not like the ingredients printed on the tube.  I will return this  product for a refund in the near future.</li>
    <li> It is by far the  best Vegan toothpaste that I have used so far. I use toms of Maine mouthwash with it. It is supposed to be made with multiple Ayurvedic herbs which are very good for the teeth. Once I get used to it, I do not want to use anything else. I strongly feel the quality of this toothpaste is much  better than the average paste on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One can also buy this toothpaste in most Indian Grocery stores.</li>
    <li> Overall its a great toothpaste good for teeth natural product. Me and my family have been using this for years . I don&#x27;t understand why some people are too much skeptical about Formaldehyde as an ingredient in it (which is a minor ingredient even if it is present).When it comes to me, I don&#x27;t care even if it contains small amounts of formaldehyde considering the fact that the same ingredient is also used in manufacturing lipsticks, shampoo,deodorants, nail polish, e.t.c as a bonding agent.

    <li> We first tried this toothpaste while travelling in India and found that it left our teeth feeling extremely clean and shiny, far more so than the usual brands. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> My whole family have been using Dabur&#x27;s Meswak toothpaste for quite number of year, and we absolutely love it. Until last week I did not read all the ingredients of the toothpaste and was horrified to read &amp;#34;Formaldehyde&amp;#34; in the list. You probably know that this chemical had been deemed carcinogenic and even J&amp;J pulled it out of their soaps and shampoos. Dabur must remove formaldehyde from it&#x27;s Meswak toothpaste and win me and my friends back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why complicate everyday products like toothpastes, soaps and shampoos with deadly chemicals?</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a convenient and healthy alternative to fluoride toothpaste. A friend mentioned Meswak. I purchased it here on Amazon from this vendor, and after using it for about a week, I like it so far. The Meswak tastes like cinnamon to me which is quite pleasant in contrasts to another natural product, Neem leaf powder, which tastes bitter like tobacco. It leaves my teeth feeling clean and my breath smelling refreshing. I&#x27;ve only used it for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is this - the product gives you 30 months from the stamped date for usage. My product was stamped 07/12 which gives me only a few months of usage. Although I will more than likely be finished with this tube before the date, it  would have been nice to have received a fresher product from the vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I will more than likely repurchase this product.</li>
    <li> This product should not be sold in the U.S.  I will be requesting a refund.&lt;br /&gt;From Wikipedia:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In view of its widespread use, toxicity and volatility, exposure to formaldehyde is a significant consideration for human health.[4] On 10 June 2011, the US National Toxicology Program described formaldehyde as \\&quot;known to be a human carcinogen\\&quot;.[5][6][7]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gas at room temperature, formaldehyde is colorless and has a characteristic pungent, irritating odor. It is an important precursor to many other chemical compounds, especially for polymers. In 2005, annual world production of formaldehyde was estimated to be 23 million tonnes (50 billion pounds).[3] Commercial solutions of formaldehyde in water, commonly called formalin, were formerly used as disinfectants and for preservation of biological specimens.

    <li> I bought this because I was looking for a toothpaste without fluoride.  Both this and Tom&#x27;s of Main give me cotton mouth, but this one is the worst.  I can&#x27;t even get anything spit out without it sticking to my lips and tongue.  Also the skin in my mouth begins to peel away every time I use the stuff.</li>
    <li> Just a nice foamy toothpaste with a nice licorice taste very mild and not very minty at all, if you have sensitivity this is supposed to be great for that, I personally use all types of dental products to get relief from over sensitive gums, and I have used similar types of toothpaste before. I cannot say for sure that it will be better for gums than a typical sensitive teeth toothpaste, which may be useful. But I have used it without any problems. Some of the herbal toothpastes are fine, others are too abrasive but this seems fine so I don&#x27;t have any complaints. The flavor is fine. But I would add this may seem like an unusual flavor, if you&#x27;re used to mint. I would give it a try.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for a year and can say for sure that the paste keeps teeth and gums healthy. plus got it really fast and for the really cheap price.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has formaldehyde which is dangerous to health. I would not buy it again and threw away my purchase</li>
    <li> This product is great, taste very good and the bottle is huge for the price I paid! After using it just after the first time, the tooth pain I was buying this for really helped!! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Meswak is very medicinal if you suffer from sensitive or bleeding gums. The taste is sort of like black licorice. The best tasting toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. I highly recommend Meswak, non-fluoridated toothpaste to anyone concerned about the dangers of fluoride.</li>
    <li> returned immediately after doing research about this product and its ingredients. So gross and dangerous. BE CAREFUL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD FOR YOU</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste. It keeps my mouth nice and clean with a pleasant scent. I would not only recommend this to a Muslim but anybody.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Makes my mouth feel happy.</li>
