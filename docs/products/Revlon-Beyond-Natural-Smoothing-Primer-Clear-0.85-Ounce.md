### Positive Reviews

      <li>This is a great product...</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>and I think it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>I do not wear make up on my face, but I found this product great for holding in moisture and giving my face a \\&quot;finished\\&quot; look.  </li>
      <li>My skin looked and felt great...</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this primer for about three months now and let me tell you it is absolutely AMAZING!</li>
      <li>I read most of the reviews, which were impressive and decided to give it a shot.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and blends in with my foundation perfectly.  </li>
      <li>My advice, invest in a good set of make-up brushes and learn how to use them correctly.</li>
      <li>But it smells amazing and for me, it seems to do a good job of filling in pores so that my foundation doesn&#x27;t have to.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already recommended it to most of my friends!</li>
      <li>LOVE this primer!</li>
      <li>Nice primer.</li>
      <li>Once this is done you will have an absolute FLAWLESS Photo finish look!</li>
      <li>I used it lightly under my BB cream and it was amazing!</li>
      <li>By far, the best product in making your makeup stay where you put it!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very smooth n lite  </li>
      <li>Leaves it very smooth with or without makeup.</li>
      <li>I applied this product after moisturizer and it went on very smoothly.</li>
      <li>I love it and will buy it on line until I can&#x27;t find it there any more.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t buy Revlon much, except for the PhotoReady primers which work great on my skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It made my pores more visible, my makeup ran more and it gave my skin a horrid, oily appearance.</li>
      <li>I am a very happy camper with this primer and would definitely buy it again!!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>rewind primer SO much better.</li>
      <li>As a senior citizen, I found that by usinkg it under my makeup my skin looked better.  </li>
      <li>But honestly this isn&#x27;t oil free or hypoallergenic or anything</li>
      <li>like it was more even.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t make my skin look any better, didn&#x27;t reduce pores, it didn&#x27;t make my foundation look any better or stay on any longer.</li>
      <li>The wrapping &amp;#34;appears&amp;#34; to be ok</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad that I can get this product through Amazon.</li>
      <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>I love using this before foundation.</li>
      <li>If anything, my makeup looked more flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was worried about my makeup appearing caked because I felt like I was just adding one more layer of gunk to my face</li>
      <li>I think I should stick to more matte primers.</li>
      <li>Next I apply my liquid foundation with a foundation brush (gives a flawless, airbrushed look when applied with a foundation brush).</li>
      <li>This product was just simply magical.</li>
      <li>The complete difference it makes is incredible.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t find this in stores any more.  </li>
      <li>On a day when I want to look my best, I definitely use this.</li>
      <li>This primer is perfect, it smooths my face creating super soft skin.</li>
      <li>I love how easy it glides on and makes my foundation stick glide on like butter.</li>
      <li>This primer is clear and silky smooth and has a very light but pleasant</li>
      <li>It minimized the appearance of fine lines in my eye area, along with minimizing pore appearance.  </li>
      <li>It still works fine,</li>
      <li>I received this product ridiculously quickly!  </li>
      <li>But makes a huge difference under make up or no make up.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s greasy and doesn&#x27;t completely smooth out the skin</li>
      <li>Primers fill in your pores, smooth over acne imperfections, and \\&quot;seal\\&quot; your skin to prevent oil from seeping though and mixing with your foundation...</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy more!!</li>
      <li>For best results, I recommend that you exfoliate (I use a basic apricot scrub in my morning shower), then apply a light layer of your favorite moisturizer, then apply the primer, and finally, your foundation.  </li>
      <li>was so excited to use it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>but I did not notice any significant difference.</li>
      <li>It is great for long nights at work, and prevents my makeup from melting!</li>
      <li>I have used several primers before and this is by FAR the best!</li>
      <li>primer is clear and goes on nice and smooth after applying your moisturizer, and before applying your liquid foundation.  </li>
      <li>I liked the fact that this is clear!  </li>
      <li>Best primer on the market or at least that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
      <li>I was hoping this would be great like the other reviews said, but it didn&#x27;t happen for me.</li>
      <li>So many primers just feel like I&#x27;m smoothing silicone on my skin, and even after drying I find foundation just seems to slide around on top of the primer without properly setting.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND EVERYONE TO TRY THIS PRODUCT:)</li>
      <li>it goes on smooth and evenly and sets pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>I put this on first and immediately put on my foundation, and it spreads so smoothly, evenly and quickly.</li>
      <li>People will just volunteer that I look very pretty today, etc.</li>
      <li>An important tip to remember whenever applying make-up is to always moisturize first.</li>
      <li>I have tried other primers but find Revlon Beyond Natural Smoothing Primer to be the best for me.</li>
      <li>Also it&#x27;s very light weight and does not clog pores and looks very natural ...</li>
      <li>I use good old classic ponds skin cream before I do anything.</li>
      <li>This primer is amazing, My hubby said that I can finally buy a face primer</li>
      <li>tip to avoid the caked look too, is to blot your liquid foundation lightly with tissue before applying your powder and always blow on your powder puff to avoid applying too much powder foundation.  </li>
      <li>It would not be cost effective to send the &amp;#34;pink nail polish primer&amp;#34; back for an exchange.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I also have old acne scars that I&#x27;m still working on fading and this stuff helps me to have better coverage with my foundation to conceal those.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>It is worth the money.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t leave that classic smooth feel after applied, it felt slippery</li>
      <li>My skin feels very silky smooth and my pores do look a little smaller, but not as flawless as I had wished for.</li>
      <li>Very pleasant scent, silky smooth application, and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>Then I lightly dust and set my face with loose powder using a kabuki brush being sure to remove any excess powder.</li>
      <li>Does absolutely nothing as far as I can tell for diminishing pore size or making foundation look better or wear longer, which is why I bought it in the first place.</li>
      <li>particular primer is excellent and works every bit as well as the more expensive primers out there, so save yourself some money!  </li>
      <li>This was my first time trying a primer</li>
      <li>Primer is exactly that.</li>
      <li>I love it the only primer I can use that doesn&#x27;t break my face out.</li>
      <li>is my first ever primer,&lt;br /&gt;it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best primer on the market or at least that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> Revlon Beyond Natural Smoothing Primer leaves my face soft and smoother. I use it everyday and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face (I have combination skin). It is great for long nights at work, and prevents my makeup from melting!</li>
    <li> It smells very nice when you put it on and has a somewhat oily though tolerable consistancy. Does absolutely nothing as far as I can tell for diminishing pore size or making foundation look better or wear longer, which is why I bought it in the first place. Also, it makes me break out somewhat.</li>
    <li> Provides a smoother base for foundation and concealer, which lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this primer! I used it lightly under my BB cream and it was amazing! It made my face feel very airy like I had no makeup on, way better then with just bb cream on cause that always made me feel a little sticky. My mom said it made me look like porcelain flawless!!</li>
    <li> I love using this before foundation. I have very dry skin and even though I use creamy foundation, I still have a hard time spreading the foundation on my skin. I put this on first and immediately put on my foundation, and it spreads so smoothly, evenly and quickly.</li>
    <li> CONS It smells like nail polish remover, it&#x27;s greasy and doesn&#x27;t completely smooth out the skin&lt;br /&gt;PROS The primer is soft&lt;br /&gt;~ My nose is the only area of my face where I have pores and the primer failed at covering them up at least a little</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t buy Revlon much, except for the PhotoReady primers which work great on my skin. This is NOTHING like them...&lt;br /&gt;It made my pores more visible, my makeup ran more and it gave my skin a horrid, oily appearance. Maybe for someone with dry skin?&lt;br /&gt;Also, the tube is small and there is a bad chemical smell to it, like most Revlon products.</li>
    <li> I had read about this primer in a magazine and I have been using it for 4 years.  It gives me a nice base for my foundation and helps with the wrinkles. It is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have always used this product and find it helps when I put on my foundation. I have tried other primers but find Revlon Beyond Natural Smoothing Primer to be the best for me. My makeup goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t look dry or caked. I am so glad that I can get this product through Amazon. I cannot find it in the stores anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;Judith</li>
    <li> First, let me say that this is my first experience with using a primer so I don&#x27;t know how this compares to other products. However, I have been wearing makeup for over 20 years so I have plenty of experience with different products.   At first, I was a little disappointed at the small size of the tube and wondered how long this would last. However, I quickly realized that you only need to use a very small amount. Using it every day, I would guess that this little tube will probably last a few months.  I applied this product after moisturizer and it went on very smoothly. It is clear and does have a silky feel to it. I then use a cover up stick for any blemishes followed by foundation and powder.  Overall, the product is okay but I did not notice any significant difference. The only thing I did notice was that the cover up seemed to work a little better as far as coverage and possibly my skin looked a little more even in color. But this was not significant. Maybe I was expecting too much but I was a little disapointed since other reviews claim they saw \\&quot;magical\\&quot; results.   The results also may depend on your skin type and what other products you use. I use a very thick moisturizer and Smart Cover foundation, which is also a very thick full coverage foundation. These products may work so well that a primer is not necessary for me.</li>
    <li> I would never think that something clear can make a tone of you skin so even and smooth. And you need very little of it each time. Definitely worth the money. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I got this today,&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to use it.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first ever primer,&lt;br /&gt;it makes my face feel soft and smooth,&lt;br /&gt;it makes my pores look less abrupt,&lt;br /&gt;and it isn&#x27;t thick or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is a dream.</li>
    <li> By far, the best product in making your makeup stay where you put it! Very pleasant scent, silky smooth application, and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this anymore in my local CVS.  It makes such a difference under my Bare Minerals base foundation.</li>
    <li> This is a hard to find item that my wife likes a lot and she was very happy to get some of it.</li>
    <li> First of all, in case you&#x27;re wondering why all the fuss about primers...a primer is essential if you want a matte, smooth overall look that lasts all day. Primers fill in your pores, smooth over acne imperfections, and \\&quot;seal\\&quot; your skin to prevent oil from seeping though and mixing with your foundation...which is what makes you shiny halfway through the day (or even sooner, for some of us).  And if you&#x27;re concerned that it may clog your pores and increase skin problems, I have personally never experienced any such issues.  But I do take fastidious care of my skin and always wash my face thoroughly each night before bed.  For best results, I recommend that you exfoliate (I use a basic apricot scrub in my morning shower), then apply a light layer of your favorite moisturizer, then apply the primer, and finally, your foundation.  This primer is clear and silky smooth and has a very light but pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular primer is excellent and works every bit as well as the more expensive primers out there, so save yourself some money!  Yes, the tube is small, but a very little bit goes a long way, so it should last you at least a couple of months.</li>
    <li> I used this product years ago and it worked great and had a very pleasant fragrance.  I finally ran out of the product so found this on Amazon (it must be discontinued because no stores carry it).  It still works fine, but oh my, does it smell.  A very awful chemical smell - I cannot use it and its going in the trash.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s totally a clear liquid so there&#x27;s no change in color on the face like so many other face primers. Also it&#x27;s very light weight and does not clog pores and looks very natural ... in fact it feels like nothing is on the face after applying. But makes a huge difference under make up or no make up.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t find this in stores any more.  I love it and will buy it on line until I can&#x27;t find it there any more.</li>
    <li> I purchase this because I needed a lightweight primer.I am african american and wear light makeup. This reminded me of smashbox clear primer, but a lot cheaper. I will re-purchase.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this primer was a waste of money. It didn&#x27;t make my skin look any better, didn&#x27;t reduce pores, it didn&#x27;t make my foundation look any better or stay on any longer. I have an oily t-zone and this made me shiny, and I looked greasy by the end of the day. I think I should stick to more matte primers. Also, it caused me to breakout. I was hoping this would be great like the other reviews said, but it didn&#x27;t happen for me.</li>
    <li> It arrived very quickly no problem at all it&#x27;s very smooth n lite  when putting it on your face don&#x27;t even notice it</li>
    <li> It arrived slightly late, only by like a day or so but I revived it within in a week of purchasing. The smell was a little bi harsh at first but eventual I started getting used to it. It goes on smoothly and once you give it time to dry I guess it does the job. It&#x27;s not really good at helping my pores it just helped my makeup last slightly longer. TIP: once it dries apply your makeup quickly and evenly because it&#x27;s kinda tacky and cause your makeup to dry quicker. But it last all day.</li>
    <li> I have not used the primer I received yet from this merchant.  However, I am using this product now and still have a little left.  The problem is that one of the &amp;#34;primers&amp;#34; had something akin to pink nail polish spilled on the outside.  The wrapping &amp;#34;appears&amp;#34; to be ok or I really can&#x27;t tell if it was repackaged.  The other &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34; (I purchased two) appears packaged fine.  It would not be cost effective to send the &amp;#34;pink nail polish primer&amp;#34; back for an exchange.  Overall it is the exact product that I am using now.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I apply it after I apply the moisturiser, and the result is a flawless -looking skin but not a mask</li>
    <li> I was hoping to find a less expensive primer than the Bare Escentuals &amp;#34;Prime Time&amp;#34;  I usually use (at $23+ I feel the purchase). This product has some similarities, but doesn&#x27;t go on as cleanly (feels a bit &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;) and does have a fairly strong scent, though not too unpleasant.</li>
    <li> Nice primer. Works as well as Smashbox!</li>
    <li> Only place I can find this product now. I love it the only primer I can use that doesn&#x27;t break my face out. Leaves it very smooth with or without makeup.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the greatest primer I&#x27;ve ever used, but it works well.  It doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out which I appreciate.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used primer, it&#x27;s definitely strange at first! But it smells amazing and for me, it seems to do a good job of filling in pores so that my foundation doesn&#x27;t have to. Also, this stuff smells like an expensive shampoo, very nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this primer for about three months now and let me tell you it is absolutely AMAZING! The complete difference it makes is incredible. I am very particular in the make-up I use and tend to have sensitive skin. This product was just simply magical. An important tip to remember whenever applying make-up is to always moisturize first. I use good old classic ponds skin cream before I do anything. And just a little bit goes a long way. Then I apply the Beyond Natural Primer and let it set for a minute or two. Next I apply my liquid foundation with a foundation brush (gives a flawless, airbrushed look when applied with a foundation brush). Then I use a fan brush and lightly buff my entire face. This will evenly distribute the foundation and buff it into your skin giving your fact that photo finish look. Then I lightly dust and set my face with loose powder using a kabuki brush being sure to remove any excess powder. Again I use a fan brush to buff my face, holding it on an angle so it is almost flush with my face. Once this is done you will have an absolute FLAWLESS Photo finish look! This primer has made ALL of the difference! Your pores are INSTANTLY minimized and your skin feels like silk. I have used several primers before and this is by FAR the best! But I&#x27;d like to remind people that in order to achieve the intended results with make up, make up must be applied correctly and the tool you use to apply make ALL of the difference. If you are suing your fingers and q-tips and the applicators that come with the make-up, don&#x27;t expect professional looking results. My advice, invest in a good set of make-up brushes and learn how to use them correctly. You tube has great video clips on make-up tips. Primer is exactly that. It primes your face. What you do after that is on you.</li>
    <li> I bought this the other day at Target and I am pleasantly surprised.  I have tried a few other primers but they all have a thicker consistency, which can feel a little heavy on.  I liked the fact that this is clear!  It goes on smoothly and blends in with my foundation perfectly.  My skin feels very silky smooth and my pores do look a little smaller, but not as flawless as I had wished for.</li>
    <li> This is a great product... it goes on smooth and evenly and sets pretty quickly. It creates an even palette for makeup and smells wonderful and is affordable on any budget.</li>
    <li> I bought this so it would prevent my pores from getting bigger given that I wear foundation. But honestly this isn&#x27;t oil free or hypoallergenic or anything and it just clogs your pores extra. In fact, they actually looked bigger when I had this on. Plus it&#x27;s hard to remove. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> As a senior citizen, I found that by usinkg it under my makeup my skin looked better.  No, it didn&#x27;t get rid of all of the wrinkles, but it does make the little ones look better.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it too much, left my skin dry!! Made it hard to blend my makeup. I like Maybelline age rewind primer SO much better. I think if you have oily skin this might work for you.</li>
    <li> Good  Stuff! It makes your face sooo soft! Ànd your make-up goes on much smoother too.</li>
    <li> makes my face greasy, doesn&#x27;t make my make up last longer or keep it in place. don&#x27;t waste money, buy something a bit high end that will work.</li>
    <li> I have very senstive skin, and my skin and this product did not get along.</li>
    <li> Without fail, every time I wear this under my foundation, I get compliments.  Always. People will just volunteer that I look very pretty today, etc. I can&#x27;t say that I see a huge difference myself when I look in the mirror, but I know that the only difference on those \\&quot;compliment\\&quot; days is that I&#x27;m wearing this product. On a day when I want to look my best, I definitely use this.</li>
    <li> I love how easy it glides on and makes my foundation stick glide on like butter. Amazing product! I&#x27;ve already recommended it to most of my friends!</li>
    <li> This is the best for under makeup.  So happy to find it online.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful under foundation.  It gives the skin a smooth appearance that last all day.  I recommend this product to women of all ages.</li>
    <li> Revlon&#x27;s Beyond Natural Smoothing Primer (Clear) was the first primer I used.  I do not wear make up on my face, but I found this product great for holding in moisture and giving my face a \\&quot;finished\\&quot; look.  I love it.  There is no other product like it on the market and I was sad to find out that Revlon no longer makes it.  Other primers do not give my face the clean finished look that the Revlon Beyond Natural does!</li>
    <li> So many primers just feel like I&#x27;m smoothing silicone on my skin, and even after drying I find foundation just seems to slide around on top of the primer without properly setting. This primer was a bit different, it left my skin smooth and helped make pores look smoother, and I had no problem applying matte foundation over it. It is a small bottle, but the price is great and you really don&#x27;t need to use that much, a bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I received this product ridiculously quickly!  The first thing I did was put some on my face...no make-up.  My skin looked and felt great...like it was more even. The next day I used it under my make up.  It was crazy!  my make up didn&#x27;t run or smear off.  Usually i look a bit like a raccoon after church, but I applied the primer under my eyes and on my eyelids as well. My makeup looked the same after church as it did before!  I even put it thru the ultimate test...I didn&#x27;t use WATERPROOF mascara.  everything somehow stayed in place.  I will definitely buy more!!</li>
    <li> Was a lot smaller than I expected, but it seems to work well. I&#x27;ve never used and other kind of primer because it was my first time ever using it but it seemed to do the job.</li>
    <li> I used this product under my makeup and it works great..my make up lasted the whole night no issue..but my skin broke out the next day. I wouldnt reccomend this to people who have sensative skin!</li>
    <li> Okay, I was slightly skeptical because of the low price, which was ridiculous because it was marked down and it&#x27;s Revlon.  I read most of the reviews, which were impressive and decided to give it a shot.  This was my first time trying a primer, I&#x27;ve been dying to try one and I&#x27;m so glad I chose this one to try first, because not only does it do what it&#x27;s supposed to, but it&#x27;s reasonably priced!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primer is clear and goes on nice and smooth after applying your moisturizer, and before applying your liquid foundation.  A little bit goes a long way.  It looks tiny and like you don&#x27;t get much, then I realized why, because like I said, a little bit goes a long way!  I was worried about my makeup appearing caked because I felt like I was just adding one more layer of gunk to my face but that was not the case.  If anything, my makeup looked more flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip to avoid the caked look too, is to blot your liquid foundation lightly with tissue before applying your powder and always blow on your powder puff to avoid applying too much powder foundation.  So here is what this little primer did for me.  It minimized the appearance of fine lines in my eye area, along with minimizing pore appearance.  My pores aren&#x27;t bad but that&#x27;s still a plus to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have old acne scars that I&#x27;m still working on fading and this stuff helps me to have better coverage with my foundation to conceal those.  One last perk is that I have very faint bluish veins on my eyelids.  Not bulging veins, but like a couple of faint blue lines.  The primer helped me to conceal those too once I added my foundation.  I am a very happy camper with this primer and would definitely buy it again!!</li>
    <li> I  expected better given a lot of good reviews, but I was disappointed in this.  This primer  really did nothing like what I am used to a primer doing.  It didn&#x27;t leave that classic smooth feel after applied, it felt slippery but  I could achieve that smearing any silicone lubricant to my face. It has an off smell as well, very chemical smelling. I will be going back to old brand.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying this, the product shipped on time. I like how it makes my skin feel initially. I have oily skin and this works well for me. I used too much and it had the opposite effect, but I like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim and I think it&#x27;s great. It helps build a foundation for my make-up and keeps everything in place for quite some time. Once my make-up is on I like to set it with a finishing spray and voila! My make-up is set for the day!</li>
    <li> i prefer urban decay primer potion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.... . . . . . . . . . . . .c. .</li>
    <li> Great product. I wanted a primer that would make my makeup look smooth and not show the wriggles that are starting to come.  Does the job.</li>
    <li> This primer is amazing, My hubby said that I can finally buy a face primer so I looked around amazon and found this product. I have sensitive dry skin, so I have to be very careful with the products I put on my face. Products that are too oily clogs my pores and products that have no moisture at all dries my skin out and causes red rashes and hives all over my face. This primer is perfect, it smooths my face creating super soft skin. It does wonders on making my make-up last all day and it smells divine. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND EVERYONE TO TRY THIS PRODUCT:)</li>
