      <li>I love my Dreamskin pillowcase!</li>
      <li>All the people I sent them to have been thrilled with the way they feel.</li>
      <li>But if you get any makeup like lipstick or rouge on it, it does not wash out very easily.  </li>
      <li>The texture of this is very smooth and comforting.</li>
      <li>just ok.</li>
      <li>Love this pillowcase.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so refreshing to find a product that does what it claims, and the fabric used in this pillow case truly impresses me.</li>
      <li>Its ok.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s helped with wrinkles yet, but it sure helped with sleep lines in the morning.</li>
      <li>I thought this pillow case was gonna have a more silky or smooth texture</li>
      <li>but it is an extremely soft pillowcase which is great.</li>
      <li>It has a silky smooth feel to it</li>
      <li>My skin definitely feels good in the morning and the pillowcase is well made with a quality zipper on one end.</li>
      <li>you money and buy a silk pillow case, if you&#x27;re looking for something easier on your hair, and don&#x27;t buy into the \\&quot;Makes you look younger\\&quot; spiel, use the extra bucks for some good skin cream if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this, it&#x27;s SO SOFT.</li>
      <li>She liked it well enough but didn&#x27;t notice anything about her hair being softer.</li>
      <li>It is somewhat useful in protecting against wrinkles.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a nice pillowcase - soft and gentle against the skin.  </li>
      <li>Yes, I would recommend this product, very soft!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a high quality fabric, nothing like silk or satin, very cushiony and comfortable on my face.  </li>
      <li>Somewhat ironic that an &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; pillowcase caused wrinkles!</li>
      <li>It is so soft and comfortable.</li>
      <li>I find the pillowcase soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Not sure about it reducing wrinkles from aging, but it does stop the creases which over time I&#x27;m sure would end up becoming wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I expected a better quality.</li>
      <li>Ha ha, didn&#x27;t really expect that to work did</li>
      <li>Not one to care much about wrinkles</li>
      <li>; it has few redeeming qualities to justify the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been sleeping on my DreamSkin Beauty Pillowcase for a few months and I wake up without sleep lines and my face is smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>The pillow case is definitely soft.</li>
      <li>, I like soft fabric pillow cases</li>
      <li>It is so soft, softer than anything</li>
      <li>The main thing is that it doesn&#x27;t bunch up and create wrinkles like a regular pillowcase does for me since I&#x27;m a side sleeper.</li>
      <li>I bought 2 of these pillowcases and used them for several months until I noticed brand new, deep wrinkles on the side of my face.</li>
      <li>It needs gentle washing and then you hang it to dry, so you can&#x27;t put it back on the pillow for another day.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this pillowcase! I&#x27;ve given a couple of them to family and friends and they went on and on about it, so I tried it myself. Not one to care much about wrinkles, I like soft fabric pillow cases so I figured it would serve that purpose well, and it does. What I&#x27;ve found is that I wake up and my face feels like I just washed it. For me, the result is like using a quality facial cleanser, that&#x27;s how well the fabric works on the skin. Who knew? It&#x27;s so refreshing to find a product that does what it claims, and the fabric used in this pillow case truly impresses me. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I thought this pillow case was gonna have a more silky or smooth texture but it doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s supposed to make you look younger, but after a few months of use, no younger.  Ha ha, didn&#x27;t really expect that to work did ya.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a minimum, I was hoping that it would be kinder to my hair in the morning but I wake up with the same old mess, every morning, as I do with any other pillow case I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save you money and buy a silk pillow case, if you&#x27;re looking for something easier on your hair, and don&#x27;t buy into the \\&quot;Makes you look younger\\&quot; spiel, use the extra bucks for some good skin cream if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like to rate things low, but I find it very hard to find anything to rate this case any higher than 1 star; it has few redeeming qualities to justify the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been sleeping on my DreamSkin Beauty Pillowcase for a few months and I wake up without sleep lines and my face is smooth and soft. It&#x27;s a high quality fabric, nothing like silk or satin, very cushiony and comfortable on my face.  I would recommend this product and buy it again.</li>
    <li> I expected a better quality. It&#x27;s  just ok. Not what I was hoping for, hair still gets messy on this case.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these pillowcases and used them for several months until I noticed brand new, deep wrinkles on the side of my face. I have never had anything like this before. I stopped using them and returned to a regular pillowcase. Somewhat ironic that an &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; pillowcase caused wrinkles!</li>
    <li> I have only started using it but it is an extremely soft pillowcase which is great. It has a silky smooth feel to it but your skin doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;stick\\&quot; to the pillowcase. My skin definitely feels good in the morning and the pillowcase is well made with a quality zipper on one end. See my full review at: [...]</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004YWQN1K DreamSkin Anti-Aging Beauty Pillowcase - Silky Soft]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice pillowcase - soft and gentle against the skin.  But if you get any makeup like lipstick or rouge on it, it does not wash out very easily.  It&#x27;s hard to get the stains out of it...which is annoying.  It needs gentle washing and then you hang it to dry, so you can&#x27;t put it back on the pillow for another day.  Best to have 2 of them and make sure you remove all your makeup before sleeping on it.</li>
    <li> I had no illusions of this curing my wrinkles. The main thing is that it doesn&#x27;t bunch up and create wrinkles like a regular pillowcase does for me since I&#x27;m a side sleeper. I had previously tried silk/satin pillowcases and those didn&#x27;t work for me. The texture of this is very smooth and comforting.</li>
    <li> All the people I sent them to have been thrilled with the way they feel. Everyone loves them and will continue using them.</li>
    <li> I bought this specifically for trying to reduce creases/lines in my face caused by my pillowcase. It works - I bought it two years ago and am purchasing a new one as it&#x27;s a little tired after two years. It definitely works! I am a side sleeper and had been noticing lines/creases on my face in the mornings caused from sleeping on a regular pillowcase. This pillowcase definitely has worked - in the two years I&#x27;ve used this, I maybe two or three times have had this happen - that&#x27;s it. Before, it was two or three times per week. I even travel with it. I find the pillowcase soft and smooth. Not sure about it reducing wrinkles from aging, but it does stop the creases which over time I&#x27;m sure would end up becoming wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Its ok. I don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
    <li> The pillow case is definitely soft. It is somewhat useful in protecting against wrinkles. It fits just about any pillow.</li>
    <li> I sleep on my side, and had hoped this pillow would lessen the wrinkles on the left side of my face.  Perhaps they are slightly less noticeable, but not much.  After 6 weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell yet whether it did what it was supposed to.</li>
    <li> Love this pillowcase. It is so soft and comfortable. I used to wake up with &amp;#34;pillow wrinkles&amp;#34; on my face!  Now I don&#x27;t, so I can rave about this pillowcase!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s helped with wrinkles yet, but it sure helped with sleep lines in the morning. Yes, I would recommend this product, very soft!!!</li>
    <li> Love this, it&#x27;s SO SOFT. I have no idea if it&#x27;s going to help with wrinkles or anything, but it&#x27;s WAY softer and nicer than my regular pillow case!</li>
    <li> Got it for my mom on mother&#x27;s day. She liked it well enough but didn&#x27;t notice anything about her hair being softer. She uses a towel rolled under her neck b/c of her c-curve issue. She used it w/ that and said the one day she slept with her face on the pillowcase she got marks on her face. She likes the pillowcase, maybe she&#x27;ll start seeing a difference in her hair moisture levels soon.</li>
    <li> I love my Dreamskin pillowcase! It is so soft, softer than anything and I believe it helps with wrinkles and hair. Nothing compares to its softness!</li>
