      <li>Would prefer more shimmer, especially since the color is so muted.</li>
      <li>The color is whiter than depicted but it is a pretty shade.</li>
      <li>I got it when Amazon was offering $1 or $2 (can&#x27;t really remember exactly) coupon and</li>
      <li>It takes some doing to build up color on the eyelid, but once on, I have to say with added dark liner, it is a nice effect.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Yes, the day I bought this, Amazon had a coupon clip for the same value as that of the product and shipping free.</li>
      <li>It has a little bit of shimmer to the shadow and its just a nice soft ivory color</li>
      <li>but I love CoverGirl Eye Enhancers and wanted to try something new - works well blended with other colors</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I personally enjoy the natural look, sometimes even using to cover over my under eye dark circles!</li>
      <li>, I feel it really helps to open up my eyes.</li>
      <li>Arrived completely smashed like powder.</li>
      <li>Very neutral color that tends to blend in with my skin color, not really any shimmer to it.</li>
      <li>love this shadow but it came broken into a hundred pieces.</li>

<li> Good eye shadow, works well for base coat.</li>
<li> The shadow holds fairly well when I used a foundation base.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores where I live so thank you, amazon!</li>
<li> The formula doesn&#x27;t dry out or wear off or settle in the creases of the eye lid.</li>
<li> Nice brow bone highlight cold!</li>
<li> Does that mean it&#x27;s old?</li>
<li> Was packed loosely in a box with other things...was not worth returning.</li>
<li> However, the consistency is weird, very chalky, crumbly, and dry.</li>
<li> Came in a powdery mess  All loose and damaged.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately my eye shadow arrived all broken up, I thing due to packing (was just loosely banging around inside a HUGE box during shipping)</li>
<li> My friends told me my eyes look shimmer and little</li>
<li> It&#x27;s getting very hard to find at any store, as I understand CG is going to round pots of shadow instead of the square (per CVS employee).</li>
<li> Product came as broken piece inside.</li>
<li> The powder was broken</li>
<li> It arrived broken and never got a replacement.</li>
<li> Gave it 3 stars because it arrived broken.  </li>
<li> With comments about product getting crumbled on arrival, I was very skeptical as to how it would be.&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
<li> but I didn&#x27;t want that to reflect badly on the product.</li>
<li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
<li> Horrible..</li>

    <li> Have used this before and this was a great price</li>
    <li> Great product and color.  Had one before and needed to order more.  Great transaction and arrived quickly and as promised.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> I had ordered this for my wife and she loves it</li>
    <li> Gave it 3 stars because it arrived broken.  Was packed loosely in a box with other things...was not worth returning.</li>
    <li> Arrived completely smashed like powder.</li>
    <li> Very neutral color that tends to blend in with my skin color, not really any shimmer to it. Would prefer more shimmer, especially since the color is so muted. Blends well and applies easily though.</li>

    <li> Good covergirl shadow.</li>
    <li> It is a light color but I love CoverGirl Eye Enhancers and wanted to try something new - works well blended with other colors</li>
    <li> I like the pan size to be big enough that I&#x27;m not struggling to get the shadow onto the brush, I feel that this size is just right. I also like that when I find a color I like I have a lot of it.  It has a little bit of shimmer to the shadow and its just a nice soft ivory color, I feel it really helps to open up my eyes. The shadow holds fairly well when I used a foundation base. Does not crease and last all day.</li>
    <li> Came in a powdery mess  All loose and damaged.  Must have been ancient and expired product to be that damaged on arrival.</li>
    <li> It arrived broken and never got a replacement. But the color was nice and applies smoothly.</li>
    <li> This is a great light color for everyday use, or you can use it in combination with a darker color for an evening look. CoverGirl never dissapoints me. I will definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeshadow! It&#x27;s a great base with no creasing at all. And the price is right! It&#x27;s hard to find in stores where I live so thank you, amazon!</li>
    <li> This has been my go-to eye lighter for years. It&#x27;s getting very hard to find at any store, as I understand CG is going to round pots of shadow instead of the square (per CVS employee). I absolutely LOVE this color!</li>

    <li> love this shadow but it came broken into a hundred pieces.</li>
    <li> Horrible..Product came as broken piece inside. Since I bought it in $0.09, I did not bother to return instead of throwing it in trash can.</li>
    <li> I mainly go with more neutral colors when purchasing eye shadow. This color has worked out great</li>
    <li> Very fair, nude color. I personally enjoy the natural look, sometimes even using to cover over my under eye dark circles!

    <li> With comments about product getting crumbled on arrival, I was very skeptical as to how it would be.&lt;br /&gt;Mine arrived in great condition today. Fastest delivery. Beautiful color and I can carry this around in my work bag. Its very soft and the applicator brush is good enough to apply well.&lt;br /&gt;Must I say, I got this free??

    <li> Love this eye shadow.  I got it when Amazon was offering $1 or $2 (can&#x27;t really remember exactly) coupon and this eye shadow ended up costing me $0.50 and with &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; the shipping was free.
