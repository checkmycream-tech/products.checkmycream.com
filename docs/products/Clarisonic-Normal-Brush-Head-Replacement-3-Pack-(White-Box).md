      <li>The brush heads don&#x27;t fit on my Clarisonic</li>
      <li>They will make a fabulous stocking stuffer.  </li>
      <li>Kinda like just when you get your teeth clean at the dentist.</li>
      <li>I just want more bank for your bucks of the real thing, NOT replicas.</li>
      <li>I mean it&#x27;s awesome recommend to everyone</li>
      <li>Take your time the first time you clean your face with it.  </li>
      <li>It is rare that I every get pimples, now.  </li>

      <li>I am very disappointed but learned a good lesson, if the price is too good it might just be too good to be true.</li>

      <li>It is kind of hard to find a set of 3 of these for my Clairsonic at such a great price as these.  </li>
      <li>Wife enjoys this very much.  </li>
      <li>The Mia cleanses my face more deeply &amp; thoroughly than a wash cloth.</li>

      <li>It doesnt fit my clarisonic and it makes loud noises.</li>
      <li>I wanted to think that amazon is better than ebay, but Amazon is starting to be like ebay for me.  </li>
      <li>They came in unmarked boxes and even though the brush heads attached to the Clarisonic just fine with no weird noises during operation, it felt really strange on my face.  </li>
      <li>Considering how much the device is, I think Clarisonic is ripping you off on the replacement heads --</li>
      <li>The brushes are gentle but do the job without being too abrasive on my skin.</li>
      <li>I have been very dedicated to cleansing my face twice a day since I was 20 (now 40).  </li>
      <li>right and makes an additional loud noise when in use</li>
      <li>They look like normal Clairsonic brushes, but when attached to my unit they make a funny clacking sound, and it seems like the unit is working a bit harder than normal.  </li>
      <li>Will definitely be shopping for more of these in the future.</li>
      <li>this is a great priced on these expensive &amp;#34;refills.&amp;#34;  I stocked up and won&#x27;t need to buy again for a while.</li>
      <li>and they are so much cheaper than going through the company directly.</li>
      <li>I use the normal brushes.  </li>
      <li>They are exactly what I expected.  </li>
      <li>I mean, they&#x27;re pretty much just plastic.</li>
      <li>With the intense cleansing of the pores, I rarely to never have unsightly breakouts.</li>

    <li> I have been using Claisonic Mia for 4 years and it still works effectively.  I use the normal brushes.  The Mia cleanses my face more deeply &amp; thoroughly than a wash cloth. With the intense cleansing of the pores, I rarely to never have unsightly breakouts. It is a preventative measure to avoid pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Thankfully, Amazon.com has great customer service and they are refunding my purchase.  Unfortunately, I had to use one of the brush heads to know that it was a counterfeit Clarisonic product.  They came in unmarked boxes and even though the brush heads attached to the Clarisonic just fine with no weird noises during operation, it felt really strange on my face.  The bristles were very rough and it didn&#x27;t spread the cleanser on my face, it all collected at the base of the bristles.  I had no idea that fake brush heads existed!  I am very disappointed but learned a good lesson, if the price is too good it might just be too good to be true.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my clairsonic 1-2 yrs. I love it, my face always feels clean after I use it. Brushes are easy to replace every 3 months.</li>
    <li> Very bad. Ver bad. Very bad. Very bad. I hope they dont sell these items again on Amazon.  They are making all kind of noise.</li>
    <li> These Clarisonic brushes are wonderful on the skin.  They are exactly what I expected.  However, they are on the expensive side.  This is why I did not give this product five stars.</li>
    <li> They got here on time and they work amazing will defiantly buy it again I mean it&#x27;s awesome recommend to everyone</li>
    <li> Go to the Department stores and price out this item yourself! You will see just how valuable it is to shop on-line. The savings are enormous!</li>
    <li> You were great to do business with. Everything was expedited smoothly and promply with clear return instructions inside. Thank you</li>
    <li> use these with my mia -- they seem a little rougher than the ones that came with it, which were also normal. This is quite a bargain -- usually find just a two pack for $40</li>
    <li> These work great and they are so much cheaper than going through the company directly. Considering how much the device is, I think Clarisonic is ripping you off on the replacement heads -- I mean, they&#x27;re pretty much just plastic. Definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> Take your time the first time you clean your face with it.  It really is a big difference from &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; face washing.  It is really nice.  Kinda like just when you get your teeth clean at the dentist.</li>
    <li> The price is incredible!!  They will make a fabulous stocking stuffer.  I will definitely  be ordering this product  again. 😄</li>
    <li> I like the brush...it works great...it serves it&#x27;s purpose...to clean your face and feel nice and fresh. and I&#x27;m out of words.</li>
    <li> I thought I would order these on Amazon because they were such a deal compared to buying them in the store.  BEWARE...you get what you pay for!  The brush heads don&#x27;t fit on my Clarisonic right and makes an additional loud noise when in use and you have a very hard time getting them on and off.  I tried this numerous times hoping it would go away or fit better, but it doesn&#x27;t.  My guess they are factory rejects and that&#x27;s why they are selling them at a lower price.  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> It is kind of hard to find a set of 3 of these for my Clairsonic at such a great price as these.  Will definitely be shopping for more of these in the future.</li>
    <li> this is a great priced on these expensive &amp;#34;refills.&amp;#34;  I stocked up and won&#x27;t need to buy again for a while.</li>
    <li> I have used a clarisonic brush on my face for years and it really keeps the pores clean and exfoliates so I&#x27;m less wrinkly.  Plus, products soak in better after cleaning.</li>
    <li> great price, super service, am very happy with the overall experience. The nearest store that carries this product is a lot pricier.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the savings from purchasing these replacement heads.  They were equivalent to the ones I received when I purchased the unit and I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily to cleanse my face.  I have been very dedicated to cleansing my face twice a day since I was 20 (now 40).  I was prone to occassional breakout in the t-zone area.  This gets my face cleaner than I thought possible.  It is rare that I every get pimples, now.  Very happy!</li>
    <li> THESE BRUSHES DID NOT FIT MY CLARISONIC. I DID NOT NOTICE IT UNTIL ABOUT THREE MONTHS LATER, THEREFORE IT WAS TOO LATE TO RETURN THEM.</li>
    <li> I wanted to think that amazon is better than ebay, but Amazon is starting to be like ebay for me.  Having sellers sell fake product pretending to be the real thing. I know what you are thinking, then go pay for the real thing at a B&amp;M store, but I want a good deal that is why i shop Amazon. That doesnt mean i want to sacrifice quality. I just want more bank for your bucks of the real thing, NOT replicas. If its a replica, please indicate so, but dont mislead the consumers. These brushes were terrible. It doesnt fit my clarisonic and it makes loud noises. It doesnt even seem like the bristles are even rotating.</li>
    <li> Wife enjoys this very much.  She uses the product on a regular basis and will be purchasing it again soon.</li>
    <li> I love The Clarisonic Mia.. The brushes are gentle but do the job without being too abrasive on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have three Clarisonics so this was a good deal for me. Planning on getting more of these head sets.</li>
    <li> They look like normal Clairsonic brushes, but when attached to my unit they make a funny clacking sound, and it seems like the unit is working a bit harder than normal.  I won&#x27;t order from this vendor again -- I&#x27;m guess they are some kind of knock-off though advertised as Clairsonic.</li>
