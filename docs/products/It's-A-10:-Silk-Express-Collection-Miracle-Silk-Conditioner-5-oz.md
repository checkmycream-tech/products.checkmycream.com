      <li>and I fell in love with it....</li>
      <li>I received this package very quickly too.</li>
      <li>But what the hell right!</li>
      <li>anyone has straight hair and still straightens their hair for that shiny, more just &amp;#34;Out of the salon&amp;#34; look, this is the product.</li>
      <li>We use it everyday and it makes  your hair easy to manage and feels great.</li>
      <li>The plan was to wash my hair with shampoo once a week, then follow each day with a warm rinse, then a tiny bit of the silk conditioner.  </li>

    <li> So I searched for these products of &#x27; It&#x27;s a 10 &amp;#34; sorry to say no big difference from my other conditioner ! It&#x27;s expensive &amp; not worth it! sorry to say.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT!  I have very thick and very course hair and nothing makes it soft and silky but I used this product just once and I fell in love with it....i used the silky shampoo &amp; conditioner as well as the leave in oil.  I am ordering a stockpile.</li>
    <li> This conditioner really does the trick. I use this along with the &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; shampoo, and combined they&#x27;re miraculous. I have coarse and over processed hair from highlighting and flat ironing. I have tried many different conditioning products, but no other brand has tamed and softened my hair like the &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; line. Pricey, but you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it at once. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a ten is the best conditioner I have ever used. My hair feels so soft.</li>
    <li> Love the way this makes hair feel so silky. Not too weighty but is pretty smoothing. Smells nice too! I like the matching shampoo also. The Keratin formula of both is better though.</li>
    <li> The best conditioner I.ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves it too. She told my daughter about it and she order it for her self.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; have the best products I&#x27;ve eber used.</li>
    <li> I have long straight hair, (past my waist) and usually use a handful of conditioner to make sure it gets all the way through to the ends. I don&#x27;t like getting it in my roots so much, anyway as I do this I usually get a comb and run a big comb through it slowly. Then I use the It&#x27;s a 10 Leave in Spray Conditioner. Well, when I received this it was a little bit small and I was not very happy. But what the hell right! I could tell right off when I started putting this in my hands I only needed very little, believe it or not a little more than a DIME size. It was very creamy. So I rubbed my hands together and it did work through ALL of my hair. ALL OF IT. I was so shocked. But, I still had to blow dry and see results......&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has straight hair and still straightens their hair for that shiny, more just &amp;#34;Out of the salon&amp;#34; look, this is the product. I will not go back to Pantene. This is the one product I have been looking for, well over 30 years!!! Even more than 40. My hair feels lighter and softer and is shinier. OH and I didn&#x27;t use my leave in conditioner. My hair was combing out perfectly without it, so I skipped it altogether. I hope this helps anyone who is looking for a perfect conditioner. My hair is highlighted and Old, it needs extra help. ;-)</li>
    <li> I have been using it for month and it is great! I love the smell too get compliments all the time!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t believe how good this is for your hair! We use it everyday and it makes  your hair easy to manage and feels great.</li>
    <li> Very few products do a good job on my thick, curly, frizzy hair.  10 Silk Express Miracle Silk Conditioner  helps  me untangle&lt;br /&gt;my hair after washing and softens the smooths the hair</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d love this conditioner, but it&#x27;s just okay. It&#x27;s not worth the exorbitantly high price, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I Love this conditioner.  I have very fine hair that has frizzies and this conditioner plus the shampoo really helps to tame my hair.  I received this package very quickly too.</li>
    <li> This is the best product. I will use nothing else but this conditioner in my hair. It has made a huge difference, especially since my hair is very course and dry, due to medications I am taking. This conditioner has help me regain moisture and softness.</li>
    <li> It is a great value for the price and the product is wonderful.  Nothing tames my hair the way this does.</li>
    <li> Great product! I definitely recommend it:-)</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve bought. I have dry hair damaged hair from coloring my hair, and this shampoo makes my hair smooth and silky. It also smells soo good. It&#x27;s expensive but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Love the look and the hold forum curly hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I always buy this type of product. Just wish it was sold in a bigger bottle though.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product  I have blonde curly hair that gets very dry and frizzy.  This stuff is amazing.  A little pricey but well wprth the money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of leave-in conditioners in the last 8 years or so.  All of them were OK.  However, since moving to another state and growing out my hair to its natural platinum white and experiencing very low winter time humidity for the first time, my new stylist told me my hair and scalp were screaming out for this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair just soaks up the conditioner and looks especially great after applying a spray &amp;#34;piecey&amp;#34; product.  Of uttmost importance to me this past winter was my itchy scalp, which was driving me bonkers: I&#x27;ve never lived in a clime with such weather.  My stylist indicated that my scalp would benefit from this leave-in conditioner every day, after rinsing my hair with warm water.  The plan was to wash my hair with shampoo once a week, then follow each day with a warm rinse, then a tiny bit of the silk conditioner.  This not only stopped my winter scalp itch, but also fortified my hair shaft.</li>
    <li> This is top of line product. Im a product junky and i gota say...I BOUGHT EXTRA SO I ALWAYS HAVE THIS ON HAND FOR USE</li>
    <li> This conditioner made by Its a Ten Silk is the very best product...its great for your hair and leaves your hair feeling full and amazing...gives this consideration its worth it !</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. I just purchased my third bottle. This makes my hair feel amazing! My hair is finally growing and I think it&#x27;s partly because of this shampoo (and the blonde it&#x27;s a 10 leave in conditioner). Will continue to buy this and will not look at other conditioners.</li>
