      <li>Love the scent and how smooth this goes on.  </li>
      <li>Smells great, keeps me from sweating, goes on clearly, and leaves my skin smooth and comfortable!</li>
      <li>I wish the stick were of a firmer consistency so that it were easier to apply more lightly.</li>
      <li>and I am never fearful of being smelly.  </li>
      <li>good product at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>but it keeps me smelling good the whole day.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so good, my underarms don&#x27;t really sweat anymore.  </li>
      <li>Easy glide on, no residue on my shirts.  </li>
      <li>This deodorant goes on smooth and clear and provides great protection without drying out my underarm skin.</li>
      <li>I have an aversion to strong smells and often get headaches.</li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t strong, which some people like.</li>
      <li>On the first day, I got just a bit of itching, so I applied more of this Dove, and then I was okay.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is wonderful evening for this old lady who can still remember when she was a young girl using this</li>
      <li>This product goes on as smooth as silk.</li>
      <li>or if it actually bleached my pits but either way I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>Smells great, lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t stain white clothes in the under arm area.</li>
      <li>This product does smooth your underarms</li>
      <li>This is good for those with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Plus the price is right!</li>
      <li>Having \\&quot;soothing chamomile\\&quot; sounds like a good idea, but there isn&#x27;t actually any chamomile in it.  </li>
      <li>nice, soft scent...not overpowering at all.</li>
      <li>adequate item - does the job it&#x27;s meant to.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been brand loyal when it comes to deodorant, but I am now.</li>
      <li>This scent is great, it&#x27;s not obvious or overpowering, which I really like.</li>
      <li>I like Dove antiperspirant because it is mild</li>
      <li>Smells good, keeps my under arms dry, does what it is supposed to.</li>
      <li>Smells good and keeps me dry</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and most deodorants give me a rash, but this one took all my rashes away and none have returned.  </li>
      <li>They make my armpits so smooth and are really moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It works well for the deodorant part, and it really does keep the skin smooth.  </li>
      <li>only gripe with this product is that it&#x27;s kind of gloppy.  </li>
      <li>it has an old lady smell for sure.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice finding smells that aren&#x27;t old-lady-esque that I can actually use.</li>
      <li>It smells pleasant, is light but also long lasting.</li>
      <li>This one is gentle with a mild smell.</li>
      <li>Easy on sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It can be a little oily feeling, but it&#x27;s a good anti-perspirant.  </li>
      <li>I guess this is because my skin has gotten more sensitive as I&#x27;ve gotten older.  </li>
      <li>making my skin smooth is a lot tougher than when I was young.  </li>
      <li>Not a fan of the scent; much too flowery!</li>
      <li>My favorite it&#x27;s the only one I use, the smell isnt over powering</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find this scent in the store, and I really like it!</li>
      <li>I work-out  by running and participating in hot yoga</li>
      <li>Love it works well and has definitely improved the appearance of my underarms.  </li>
      <li>Then I shaved again, and I figured that shaving twice within a couple of days would really do me in, but no, still no bumps!  </li>
      <li>only issue is the sweat protection isn&#x27;t as strong as I&#x27;m used to - hence the 4/5 stars.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have not had this product since I was a teenager and a Brought back a lot of good memories and it works great. The fragrance is wonderful evening for this old lady who can still remember when she was a young girl using this</li>
    <li> I always use dove deodorant for my under arms just wanted to try a different scent and i recommend. Smells great -like flowers</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B00ACUG05M Dry Idea]] for probably over 20 years, and it&#x27;s so good, my underarms don&#x27;t really sweat anymore.  In fact, I got where I would only apply it occasionally, just to maintain my skin&#x27;s build-up of the active ingredient.  But in the last couple of years, shaving my underarms began to irritate them, and now I ALWAYS gets lots of red, itchy bumps.  I guess this is because my skin has gotten more sensitive as I&#x27;ve gotten older.  I tried putting on my Dry Idea after shaving, but that didn&#x27;t help.  I tried exfoliating the next day (because I know the cause of the bumps is ingrown hair), but that made it worse.  I tried hydrocortisone cream.  That helped a bit, and at least made it where I wasn&#x27;t scratching at my underarms all night, but it didn&#x27;t fix the problem.  I tried coconut oil (anti-inflammatory and slightly antibacterial), and that helped a bit, but not enough.  I tried all sorts of things, but I had just about given up on shaving my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove has been advertising for years how their antiperspirants moisturize your underarms, but I always thought that was kind of silly.  I mean, it&#x27;s not like my underarms have dry skin.  But I did try another variety of Dove, and it didn&#x27;t do anything for the bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw Dove&#x27;s \\&quot;Go Sleeveless\\&quot; campaign, and I decided to try it.  I was extremely skeptical because their regular Dove hadn&#x27;t helped, and there is not much difference in the ingredient list.  But what do you know...no red bumps!  On the first day, I got just a bit of itching, so I applied more of this Dove, and then I was okay.  I waited a couple of days, and still no bumps!  And yeah, I really could go sleeveless, something that would have been impossible before.  Then I shaved again, and I figured that shaving twice within a couple of days would really do me in, but no, still no bumps!  So I&#x27;m REALLY impressed.  I don&#x27;t know what ingredient is responsible, but it really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use unscented deodorant, but I did not see the Go Sleeveless Dove in anything but scented varieties, so I choose this bottle, um, just because it was pretty.  Having \\&quot;soothing chamomile\\&quot; sounds like a good idea, but there isn&#x27;t actually any chamomile in it.  However, the scent is very, very light, I so I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe with this product is that it&#x27;s kind of gloppy.  I wish the stick were of a firmer consistency so that it were easier to apply more lightly. But if I&#x27;m careful in how much I apply, my skin does eventually dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Never thought I would write a review about a deodorant, but this one is a keeper.  It works well for the deodorant part, and it really does keep the skin smooth.  I am pretty old now, so making my skin smooth is a lot tougher than when I was young.  It goes on dry and stays that way.  Very subtle scent.  Would prefer no scent at all, but until something better comes along, I will keep using this brand and item.</li>
    <li> My favorite of all the Dove Anti-Perspirant Deodorants and a good price here too!</li>
    <li> Love it works well and has definitely improved the appearance of my underarms.  I have very sensitive skin and most deodorants give me a rash, but this one took all my rashes away and none have returned.  Will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This product goes on as smooth as silk. I do observe that it leaves some residue on my clothes (underarms). However I do like its subtle scent--it&#x27;s not overpowering. Though I don&#x27;t like it that much, there&#x27;s no doubt it will work for others. If I should purchase again, it will be for a family member who has no issues with it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get over the smell of this one to even use it. it has an old lady smell for sure.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell &amp; I&#x27;m very picky about scents. It does make the skin of my underarms look and feel nicer.</li>
    <li> It does the job....however kind of smears and hard to remove.  Would not purchase again</li>
    <li> As my wife is very happy with this item, that means this is an even better deal. Glad I found it, and so is she; doesn&#x27;t have to worry at work or at home!</li>
    <li> This product does smooth your underarms it&#x27;s amazing. The scent lasts the whole day. I definitely would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The smell of his item is great and it really helps with under arm shaving irritation. I prefer deodorant over the added antiperspirant but the price was right for sure!</li>
    <li> Love this product smells great!</li>
    <li> Favorite for scent, protection, and feel</li>
    <li> Wife likes it. all that matters</li>
    <li> Smells good, keeps my under arms dry, does what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and how smooth this goes on.  It feels like photo finish foundation primer (if you&#x27;ve ever used it -- you know it feels like liquid silk as you roll it on your skin.)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite deodorant!  I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate, nor dry out my skin.  It&#x27;s likely scented and wonderfully feminine.  A great body care must-have!</li>
    <li> I was largely skeptical about this product in terms of it clearing irritation and bumps, but I am happy to say that it really does work in just a few days. It smells pleasant, is light but also long lasting. True to its word, if you have irritations from hair removal, this product heals them in less than a week. Will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> good product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> love it. I even like the scent! I have a VERY discerning nose and I don&#x27;t like MOST scents of anti-perspirant  Deoderant but this does smell nice and it works. Plus the price is right!</li>
    <li> This deodorant smelled good at first but as the day went by it turned very musky smelling. This and unfraganced turn very musky which is a musky body smell..which is a turn off! Back to my Dove invisible solid fresh deodorant.  It may not have the sleeveless beauty care benefits but it keeps me smelling good the whole day.</li>
    <li> I like Dove antiperspirant because it is mild and I tend to have sensitive skin.  The &amp;#34;go sleeveless&amp;#34; version does give a nicer appearance to your underarms, which I expected to just be a gimmick.  I was surprised to see smoother, softer skin, and it evened out the skin tone as well.  I also do not have a problem with this making white marks on my clothing the way some products do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been brand loyal when it comes to deodorant, but I am now. This stops my sweat, doesn&#x27;t show up on my clothes, and even the scented ones are very subtle. Keeps my skin soft and costs a few bucks. I&#x27;d be foolish to look for something different!</li>
    <li> This is a smooth &amp; nice smelling deodorant. It also works well for not irritating sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Works and smells great. The perfume in this is soft and not over powering. I rarely find this scent in the local store so I have this on reorder. Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant.  Smells good and keeps me dry</li>
    <li> I love Dove deodorant and have for years. This one seems less effective than the other kinds/scents though. I went back to any other Dove.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the scent; much too flowery!</li>
    <li> i found this to be a good deodorant it has a nice scent and i have this on my subscribe list also,</li>
    <li> This is good for those with sensitive skin.  It is not too fragrant, like some other brands that have you smelling like flowers or baby powder.  Has a light scent which is not over powering at all, it is hardly noticeable.</li>
    <li> Great price without having to go to the store.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Does not get all over your clothes.  No skin irritation. I will purchase this again...thanks for putting it on auto order.</li>
    <li> Of all the scents and brands and years of trial and error, this is my fav!</li>
    <li> This deodorant goes on smooth and clear and provides great protection without drying out my underarm skin. Smells nice as well.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite!  I have never had a deodorant work so well. I used to have to rotate deodorants every week or so bc they would stop working.  With Dove, I have been using it for a year or so and it has never quit working!  I love love love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love the scent.  Works like the others as far as preventing sweat.  The scent is what makes me buy it again.  Not too perfumy.  But I find the chamomile to be calming.</li>
    <li> Dove always makes good products. This one is gentle with a mild smell.</li>
    <li> Absolute best, hands-down.  Soft but works.</li>
    <li> adequate item - does the job it&#x27;s meant to.  nice, light scent</li>
    <li> The smell gives me a headache!! I usually love all you scents but this one is horrible. I will cancel my monthyl subscription.</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant. Smells great, keeps me from sweating, goes on clearly, and leaves my skin smooth and comfortable! Yay!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this scent in the store, and I really like it! Dove is my favorite antiperspirant and this doesn&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say keeps me dry. Or stop the perspiration. It&#x27;s okay</li>
    <li> Again, love all the dove products.  It&#x27;s an outstanding brand that lives up to it&#x27;s name.  How wonderful, nice nice nice.</li>
    <li> My favorite it&#x27;s the only one I use, the smell isnt over powering and I feel it works well. It&#x27;s the only brand and scent I use.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, packaged appropriately. Worked even when not expected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had dark skin under my arms for twenty years due to a skin condition and doctors said, oh, well.  Then I saw an ad on TV saying something like  &amp;#34;use this for 5 days and go sleeveless&amp;#34;  I used it and... WOW. Just WOW.  I plan to tell my doc for her other patients like me. I wish they had invented it sooner!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dove man. Smells fantastic, all the ladies love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always has darker underarms that made it look like I hadnt shaved even if I had that day and then I used this. It doesn&#x27;t look like that anymore! Idk if it made my hair more fine or if it actually bleached my pits but either way I&#x27;m happy. The only downside is it makes your underarms a bit itchy once the hair starts to grow. But I love it! I&#x27;m on my second stick</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched a long time to find an AntiPerpirant deodorant that has staying power and this works for me.  Subtle fragrance and keeps me dry through my work day.</li>
    <li> I have an aversion to strong smells and often get headaches. This has an excellent fragrance that&#x27;s not too strong or overpowering. Who wants to go around smelling like deodorant anyway? Works great, as do all the Dove products.</li>
    <li> Dove is an excellent deodorant.  Highly recommend. Goes on smooth and the smell is nice and subtle- not overwhelming at all!</li>
    <li> This actually WORKS! I&#x27;ve tried lots of different deodorants and antiperspirants with varying degrees of failure. I finally found one that actually keeps me reasonably dry and most importantly keeps me odor-free!</li>
    <li> This deodorant is so moisturizing. Don&#x27;t have to worry about any dark marks on my armpit now, because after a month or so of using this product, my skin seems to be much more nourished. I also really like the smell of this one in particular.</li>
    <li> Will I purchase again? Not sure. The smell isn&#x27;t strong, which some people like.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product.  Easy on sensitive skin but actually works all day and the scent is fabulous but subtle.  I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> Easy glide on, no residue on my shirts.  I have not seen much yellowing in the pits of my shirts from the anti-perspirant.  I work-out  by running and participating in hot yoga and this product does the job.  I also play around the house with my daughter,who is a toddler, then sometimes I will go to work  and I am never fearful of being smelly.  It is not an overpowering scent, which I like because I don&#x27;t want to have people notice any smells coming from my pits.</li>
    <li> I bought this deodorant because it was the best price per ounce. I didn&#x27;t think I needed help &amp;#34;going sleeveless,&amp;#34; but after a week or two I noticed that my armpits looked better than they have since I started shaving them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is the sweat protection isn&#x27;t as strong as I&#x27;m used to - hence the 4/5 stars.  If I&#x27;m in a hotter than normal situation I notice that my armpits are damp.</li>
    <li> I always like Dove anti-perspirant deodorants. They make my armpits so smooth and are really moisturizing. This scent is great, it&#x27;s not obvious or overpowering, which I really like. It&#x27;s hard for me to find antiperspirants that work well enough for me, so I usually use this in the morning and a clinical strength deodorant at night. Works perfect for me :)</li>
    <li> It can be a little oily feeling, but it&#x27;s a good anti-perspirant.  Smells great.</li>
    <li> works as well as other brands that claim they are &#x27;stronger&#x27;</li>
    <li> Arrived on time....nice scent...works well.</li>
    <li> This deodorant has a nice subtle scent. Usually deodorant scents irritate my allergies (I can&#x27;t wear perfumes at all), but this is a scent that isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; or &#x27;fresh&amp;#34; and still doesn&#x27;t bother me. It&#x27;s nice finding smells that aren&#x27;t old-lady-esque that I can actually use.</li>
    <li> nice, soft scent...not overpowering at all.</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells great, lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t stain white clothes in the under arm area.</li>
