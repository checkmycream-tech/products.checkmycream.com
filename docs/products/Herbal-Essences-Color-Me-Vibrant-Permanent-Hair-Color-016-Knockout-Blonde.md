    <li> Used it to dye my previously bleached hair and a friend&#x27;s white hair. Worked well for both. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and didn&#x27;t stain my shower.</li>
    <li> REALLY LOVE IT! I always do my own hair, whether it is dying, styling, cutting, I do it all. Last month I decided to go to the salon and have my hair dyed a fun bright blue. The ONE time I go to a salon in a long time, they messed up somewhere. The color came out beautifully  and lasted a while. BUT, when it started to fade out it went bad. The color went into a grrenish/silverish color, instead of going back to the previous color. So I had decided to get this color and mix it up with another black to get that really super black, with a shine that I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This black color was simply amazing! I used it and my hair felt very nice and was super soft and shiny afterward. The best black I have ever used, and will get it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It covered the ugly color so wonderfully, I couldn&#x27;t believe it!</li>
    <li> I love using Herbal Essences &amp;#34;Color Me Vibrant&amp;#34; when I dye my hair for a few simple reasons. I have had salon quality dye jobs that were more disappointing than this stuff. I highly recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a nice, long lasting color without paying a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The color is amazing and shiny, but not overly so. Everyone thinks it&#x27;s natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The stay is longer than I have experienced with most (if not all) other dye products. I.E. 8-12 months before I even start to notice fade.&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;m sure this varies with hair types. Mine soaks up this dye like spring water to a camel.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. No ammonia smell! This dye actually smells rather pleasant. At least, from my experience.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair a very vibrant , shiny, and healthy look</li>
    <li> Great all over coverage, like the color and the seemingly natural vibrancy my hair had after. I used this to color from red (which is surprisingly difficult to cover) and it did the job well. Would definitely use it again.</li>
    <li> Deep black color at a cheap price, and the conditioner is very moisturizing! I&#x27;ve stocked up on this stuff!</li>
    <li> black is black and covers well - works good looks good thank you!!!!!!!!!!! will shop again - fast shipping! Item is just as described / Pictured -- thank you</li>
    <li> faded within 3 washes...</li>
    <li> I wish this had more blue undertones but unfortunately it was just a normal black.</li>
    <li> Came really fast, was packed great, and the color is nice too.  It&#x27;s a true jet black, with a lot of healthy shine to it. It didn&#x27;t stain my skin and it also isn&#x27;t bleeding after two washes. My hair was dark brown when I began, so I don&#x27;t know what it would look like on lighter hair. But on me it came out exactly like the box showed.</li>
    <li> Fantastic color! Just what I wanted after a L&#x27;Oréal fail!</li>
    <li> Wife loves this product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s black. It&#x27;s permanent. It is relatively non-damaging for box dye.</li>
    <li> The price is  great for the results.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and it didn&#x27;t look bland or one-dimensional. I used it to cover up a botched purple dye job, and it did the trick nicely, although it did start to fade a little after about a week and a half.</li>
    <li> Very dark, no blue tint or anything.</li>
    <li> Not only did the color look great, this product left my hair feeling AMAZING. It was actually my first time using this brand of anything, being that im black, i use products specially for black hair. But i was on a budget and this was cheap.... This is it best color ive ever used, my hair has never felt this soft. And for any black person reading this, i am part italian and part native american so my hair is a little on the finer side....but still has a lot of the african texture.</li>
    <li> The only hair color potent enough that could override the offsets of bleaching my hair!</li>
