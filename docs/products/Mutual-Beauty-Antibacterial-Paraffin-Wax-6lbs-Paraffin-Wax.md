      <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience using paraffin, but this stuff smells great and seems to have an extra low melting point.  </li>
      <li>and we like it very much</li>
      <li>Does the job however this didn&#x27;t smell any better than the generic wax they sent with my paraffin dip.</li>
      <li>using in a hot wax unit for treating arthritic joints and also for moisturizing purposes.</li>
      <li>The only thing I&#x27;m not overly happy with is that it is extremely oily.</li>
      <li>Hands have to be washed vigorously after a treatment as the hands are very greasy.</li>
      <li>Came with liquids swimming in it and VERY greasy.</li>
      <li>Did not remove easily like other paraffin wax I have used.</li>
      <li>I ordered the peach and was a little hesitant as to what it may smell like, but it wasn&#x27;t too strong at all.  </li>
      <li>but I wanted to try a different scent other than the traditional lavender or vanilla (which both smell very good as well and not overwhelming).  </li>
      <li>I was surprised at the gooyness of it.  </li>
      <li>Leaves skin well lubricated, soft &amp; supple.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m about ready to empty it out and start over with a different brand.</li>

    <li> Does the job however this didn&#x27;t smell any better than the generic wax they sent with my paraffin dip.</li>
    <li> It worked as expected</li>
    <li> Does not have ANY scent of lavender. more like body odor. Did not remove easily like other paraffin wax I have used.</li>
    <li> My wife uses it primarily for her hands and me for my foot and we like it very much and it works well for both of us.</li>
    <li> Best wax I&#x27;ve ever used. Leaves skin well lubricated, soft &amp; supple.</li>
    <li> Great paraffin! It removes from skin very easy and leaves skin soft. The fragance is delicious.</li>
    <li> love the lavender smell. did not realize how oily it would be. make sure you set up over a protective mat to make clean up easier. this will last me a very long time as is reusable. using in a hot wax unit for treating arthritic joints and also for moisturizing purposes.</li>
    <li> I expected the wax to have a lavender smell, but it was lavender color only.</li>

    <li> This is true Paraffin Wax, it melts smoothly and has the right amount of liquid to make using an easy process.  A true paraffin wax is a bit on the oilier side, that&#x27;s what makes it so unique.  If you dont like this, then dont order the Paraffin.  I ordered the peach and was a little hesitant as to what it may smell like, but it wasn&#x27;t too strong at all.  In fact, it was really pleasant.  Im normally not that big of a peach scent fan, but I wanted to try a different scent other than the traditional lavender or vanilla (which both smell very good as well and not overwhelming).  I was very pleased with this peach wax.  It was very easy to remove and the residue left over is supposed to be massaged into the skin.  I notice a huge difference when I use Paraffin wax.  The packaging was one pound in each separate bag so you don&#x27;t have to use all 6 pounds at once.  Very nice and you cant really beat the free shipping for 6 pounds of product if you are a prime member!</li>
    <li> One bar had split and melted over the other five leaving a mess in the package.</li>
    <li> Great quality and price!</li>

    <li> Great product, good price!</li>
    <li> Terrible product!!  Came with liquids swimming in it and VERY greasy. Does not work like regular paraffin wax. Does not set and get hard like regular wax, so does NOT hold the heat in.  Hands have to be washed vigorously after a treatment as the hands are very greasy. Want my money back!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this for my hands and feet- Wonderful Scent</li>
    <li> Very greasy and unpleasant feeling on my skin. I didn&#x27;t realize the entire block of wax was purple; I thought it was just the wrapper. I&#x27;m about ready to empty it out and start over with a different brand. It was a big waste of money.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that I would receive 6lbs of wax, however I only received 1lb. It was meant as a gift for my mom so I have not used it, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that I paid 35 bucks for I PC!!</li>
    <li> I did not received 6 pounds, I only received a one pound package.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience using paraffin, but this stuff smells great and seems to have an extra low melting point.  I was surprised at the gooyness of it.  It practically slides right off, but I learned that this makes it easy to clean up.</li>
    <li> Horrible, took forever to melt also smells bad. Won&#x27;t order again</li>
    <li> I received the wax but it was all melted.  What a mess!! Wax was everywhere!</li>
    <li> Works well and smells nice. No complaints</li>
    <li> Thank you, you were right on time&lt;br /&gt; I love the product .</li>
    <li> I enjoy parrifin wax on both my hands and feet, it really helps relieve arthritis pain.  I would order tis product again</li>
    <li> it is just what i was looking for 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I do like the scent, this was however purchased as a gift and I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use it myself??</li>
    <li> Awesome! Smells great</li>
    <li> Great product, grear seller.</li>
    <li> Melts easily, feels great and the as it heats up it makes your whole house smell wonderful. The only thing I&#x27;m not overly happy with is that it is extremely oily. But other than that. It is great.</li>
    <li> Gift for my wife.  She says, &amp;#34;Great product.  I use it to not only moisturize, but also to sooth arthritic pain in hands.  Love the mild lavender scent.&amp;#34;</li>
