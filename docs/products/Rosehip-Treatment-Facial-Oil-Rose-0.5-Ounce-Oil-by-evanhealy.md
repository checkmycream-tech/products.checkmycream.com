<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be backed off by the fact that this is oil.  I have combination skin and this oil, combined with the Rose Geranium spray, has really done wonders for my skin!  I use the oil sparingly...as in one pump combined with 5-7 sprays of the spray.  I rub it together in my hands and pat it over my face and neck.  I use a drop of oil under my eyes full strength.  Pat it under the eye with your ring finger.&lt;br /&gt;The 2 products combined, have the effect of a decongestant on your skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased a trial kit at my local health food store that contained this item. I am extremely happy with all of the evan healy items. I spend a lot on skin care (always have) and it has been years since I have actually got excited about my skin care regime. I have sensitive skin with an oily t-zone. This has calmed both problems down in a few short days. This is an all natural product-nothing funky or hard to pronounce on the list of ingredients. Since I started using this, I have not had to exfoliate. My skin is so smooth from it and I notice a pronounced clarity. At night I cleanse with the rose cleanser, follow with this oil, (5 micro drops does my whole face) and spray on the toner. In the day I cleanse and follow with the moisturizer. They used the word \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; in the title. I totally agree. BTW-I can&#x27;t even imagine how long this bottle will last. My tiny sample vial will last me at least a month, I would imagine this would last from 6-10 months.</li>
    <li> This is some great skin oil.  I am recent to the skin oil and it has changed how I view skincare.  I bought it at the local Whole Foods.  The scent is earthy but very pleasant and it really makes the skin look great.  I have very fair skin and I have some issues with the sun--some photo-discoloration and a history of skin cancer.  The carrot seed oil in it is great for natural sunscreen (apparently has an spf ranging from 20-35), and the rosehip seed oil is a great emollient and helps fade scars and photo-discoloration.  I can tell that it works well as sunscreen since my mark does not darken much despite it being late spring with a strong Texas sun.  My pores have never looked so good, and my sister mentioned that I have a very consistent color in my face.  I am so thrilled with how my skin looks--I just wish it was less expensive so I could use it all over!</li>
    <li> smooth and evens color with a light oil</li>
    <li> At age 58, I finally found a moisturizer that did not break out my skin.  This stuff makes my skin look great and it feels soft and no breakouts or redness.  Use it with the cleanser and facial tonic for great skin that breaths!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference with my blotches.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  I have used many, many brands of skin care - this one is by far my favorite.  It is made well and performs well, and is far less expensive than many I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
    <li> Creates a healthy glow to my skin when I wearing it.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a worker in a small grocer in New Hampshire... This is the most amazing face product I have used in a long time! After about three days of use, my eczema was gone, my skin was softer, and blemish free. I truly believe my skin is more balanced now and I don&#x27;t feel the need for any makeup. Thank you Evan Heeley and thanks to the lady for recommending this product.</li>
    <li> Evan Healy is a great line of skincare. The Rosehip Treatment oil is used after spraying with one of the atomizers to help it blend into the skin evenly. I have combination skin that is sensitive and find this product very soothing and moisturizing without making me greasy or clogging my pores. Very pleasant to use and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have oily/acne prone skin and acne scars. Nothing has ever kept my skin blemish free. I&#x27;ve always had something going on. I decided to give this product a try. I have NOT had one breakout OR blemish in 3months!!!!! I use it AM/PM, it absorbs quickly(make sure to apply to damp skin) and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my makeup during the day. I am amazed at how well this cleared my skin up.(and I work for a prestige skin care line!) absolutely recommend this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that can break out and get dry easily. I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now almost daily. I love it. No break puts and my face looks younger and brighter!</li>
    <li> I recently had a bad chemical allergic reaction to Urban Decay and I think also the Bare Minerals I was using.  My eyes became swollen and angry and the rest of my face broke out in tiny pustules and bumps.  I had been wearing the same products for years but I read abotu gradual progression of chemical allergies.  So i threw everything out including the brushes, i didnt want to take any chances.&lt;br /&gt;I just discovered Evan Healy at my Whole Foods.  I needed something to calm my irritated skin down so I bought the Blue Kit to give it a try.  After 1 night and 1 morning of use there has been a visual improvement in my skin as it calmed the inflammation down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;I found Evan Healy&#x27;s videos on youtube.  Mixing this serum with the Hydrosol together (oil &amp; water) and putting on the face is extremely luxurious!  It being winter now, my lips have also been chapped no matter what i put on them.&lt;br /&gt;Yes i have even been using the very expensive Dr. Perricone Moisture cream for a few weeksand I put that on my lips... still chapped!  My skin also is not that well moisturized from it.&lt;br /&gt;Well i love putting serums on and this rosehip oil serum is healing the skin around my eyes better than Dr. Perricone eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my lips too and immediately my chapped lips are GONE!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the chemical reaction is a blessing in disguise.  It is forcing me over to natural products and I&#x27;m happy to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im going to continue to use my Blue Kit and nothing else on my face to see how the progression goes.&lt;br /&gt;This is restoring my faith in ALL NATURAL aromatherapeutic products free of harsh chemicals and cancer-causing agents.  I am now wondering about the lies from mainstream conventional skin care about oils on the skin making oily and clogged pores.  Perhaps it is the fact that all those chemicals suppress, force and stop the skin from doing its natural thing and when you add natural oils it gets clogged?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you have irritated and chapped skin, give this serum a try.  you&#x27;ll love the aromatherapy as well.  its worth it!have irritated and chapped skin, give this serum a try.  you&#x27;ll love the aromatherapy as well.  its worth it!</li>
    <li> U guys should  be careful .I bought rose hip oli .look so different from what I bought at whole food</li>
    <li> The palms of my hands have been itching and I&#x27;ve been scratching in response for years. And for years I&#x27;ve tried everything from Shea butter to castor oil to emu oil to virgin cream of coconut to Yu-Be to Neosporin Eczema cream to cocoa butter with no real relief. The only product mildly successful was a dreadfully strong-scented lavender hand cream from Burt&#x27;s Bees that no longer seems available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a little vial of Evan Healy Rosehip Treatment Facial Oil, bought in a travel kit, for several months before it dawned on me to try the oil on my hands. And am I ever glad I did! Not only did the oil help relieve my cracked hands but I haven&#x27;t had any bleeding cracks lately. It&#x27;s also nice on my face. Since this is so pricy I&#x27;m now trying Rosehip carrier oil with a few drops of geranium for my hands and will use the rest of the Evan Healy on my face. Seriously, I am impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> Goog produt but nothing special.</li>
    <li> This is the best natural skin care I&#x27;ve ever come across!! I use these products exclusively now!!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product. I love the ingredients but the oil does not absorb well into my skin. It has not had any negative results but it has not improved my skin either. More than likely, I will use this up on other parts of my body. Would not recommend or repurchase.</li>
    <li> Extremely moisturizing without a stick oily feeling.  I LOVE the smell and this little bottles lasts a long time with only a couple of drops needed per application.</li>
    <li> This review is not about Evanhealy product but about the seller - Smallflower. The description of the product is very confusing and doesn&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s a Blue or Rose serum. It says that it&#x27;s rose only on the photo of the package, which I didn&#x27;t even look at, since I know Evanhealy products very well and use them for few years already. So I received the rose one, when I was sure that I bought the blue. I asked for the replacement and company sent me completely different product first and now they don&#x27;t agree to replace it, since they said that it&#x27;s my fault and I made a mistake. It&#x27;s wasted time and money, I&#x27;m very disappointed and will never order from Smallflower again!!! Read the label on the photo before ordering this product.</li>
