      <li>Great wig, not too shiny, hair is soft.</li>
      <li>:) I bought the curly black one, and it looks great!</li>
      <li>I have  wigs with real hair and they don&#x27;t look as nice as this one plus it cost me a lot more.</li>
      <li>and it was comfortable</li>
      <li>It looks really great, especially for the price</li>
      <li>I thought it would make a good, professional wig for when I have to see clients.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very nice, especially for the money.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just so smooth and clean cut.  </li>
      <li>Pretty lovely wig</li>
      <li>Ugh, if only my hair was this nice!  </li>
      <li>great product works as expected and was shipped on time.</li>
      <li>I hav got to say taht of the two I brands I purchased, MelodySusie&#x27;s wigs feel &amp; act more lifelike, more natural.  </li>
      <li>Most think it&#x27;s my real hair.</li>
      <li>I ordered this one and it came in quickly</li>
      <li>Pretty great for 20 dollars, but not what I expected at all.</li>
      <li>MelodySusie&#x27;s wigs come in a very nice box that states what wig is in the box and has complete care instructions on the back.  </li>
      <li>def needs to be styled out of the box the bangs go to the right side of your face</li>
      <li>I love how soft it is and the color is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>&#x27;do&#x27;s&#x27; &amp; she much prefered the ones from MelodySusie too!</li>
      <li>The wig feels like real hair and it&#x27;s not itchy!  </li>
      <li>This was my first time buying a wig</li>
      <li>The fibers feel more natural than most of my other wigs.</li>
      <li>Looks super natural I get compliments on it all the time !</li>
      <li>I wear this wig pretty much everywhere.</li>
      <li>Product as described, fast shipping</li>
      <li>The style of the hair stay in the same shape and don&#x27;t even have to do anything with it except comb it lightly.</li>
      <li>It came fast.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend both product and seller!  </li>
      <li>so I guess I can say it looks like real hair.</li>
      <li>It came with special comb and net.</li>
      <li>The hair is soft and the haircut is modern!  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>but it was easy to have them go the other way like I&#x27;m used to.</li>
      <li>The other company delivered their wigs inside outward, wrapped with a cheap, large holed hair cap all stuffed in a clear plastic zip bag with no instructions about careing for them.  </li>
      <li>from being adorable, it has a stiff mesh underneath it</li>
      <li>My only real complaint is what comes with all wigs, and that&#x27;s that it will get tangled if you don&#x27;t take good care of it!</li>
      <li>My daughter was tickled to death with her new</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have to check out their other wigs for future cosplays :)</li>
      <li>Looks really natural.</li>
      <li>he was completely fooled</li>
      <li>It really just needs styled now because the bangs are really long.</li>
      <li>It barely stayed on, so I ended up throwing it away.</li>
      <li>It is easy to style and tuck behind your ears or whatever.  </li>

    <li> love this looks so natural.will be shopping alot in future.</li>
    <li> Product as described, fast shipping</li>
    <li> My daughter at 34 is loosing her hair because of thyroid problems, so I thought I would give her a few wigs for xmas.  I hav got to say taht of the two I brands I purchased, MelodySusie&#x27;s wigs feel &amp; act more lifelike, more natural.  I watched a video from another buyer &amp; it sold me on these wigs, I just wish I had seen it before I ordered from the other company.  The other company delivered their wigs inside outward, wrapped with a cheap, large holed hair cap all stuffed in a clear plastic zip bag with no instructions about careing for them.  MelodySusie&#x27;s wigs come in a very nice box that states what wig is in the box and has complete care instructions on the back.  Besides the wig, every box includes a wig comb &amp; a very nice packaged wig cap.  My daughter was tickled to death with her new &#x27;do&#x27;s&#x27; &amp; she much prefered the ones from MelodySusie too!</li>
    <li> Very cute, nice quality, easy to style.</li>
    <li> My wig came in today and i havw to say i love it!!! The only problem is that the wig hair is coming out while i comb it but that doesn&#x27;t matter the wig is so beautiful and i might keep ordering more from the company!</li>
    <li> When I lost my hair to chemo, I decided to get a bunch of wigs. I ordered this one and it came in quickly and it&#x27;s very nice, especially for the money. But it&#x27;s too dark and too young for me, I think. I gave it to a young client with alopecia and it looks great on her.</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig, very comfortable to wear and isn&#x27;t shinny enough that I feel like I have to wear a hat to pull it off. The coloring is really really pretty, wonderful wig if you aren&#x27;t looking to fuss over it while you wear.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and great product</li>
    <li> Looks super natural I get compliments on it all the time !</li>
    <li> I bought this because I cut my hair short and dyed it purple. I thought it would make a good, professional wig for when I have to see clients. But because I had to make it smaller (it&#x27;s adjustable) it ended up bunching on the top and looked really fake and awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had other wigs before that I did not have this problem with.</li>
    <li> I love this wig.  It is the short dark brown with the angled bangs. I have a big head, even for a crossdresser and it fits well. It is easy to style and tuck behind your ears or whatever.  It looks really great, especially for the price and it photographs well. I just wish they made more variety in the shorter wigs.</li>
    <li> The wig feels like real hair and it&#x27;s not itchy!  It came fast.  Having the wig cap come with it was awesome but including the wig brush was just incredible.  Outstanding for the price!</li>
    <li> Great quality but much shorter than pictured</li>
    <li> Pretty great for 20 dollars, but not what I expected at all. It barely stayed on, so I ended up throwing it away. You&#x27;re better off investing another 15 and getting a better quality wig.</li>
    <li> Looks good at first then starts to tangle and shed a lot. It&#x27;s an alright wig got the price</li>
    <li> great product works as expected and was shipped on time.</li>
    <li> This was my first time buying a wig and I am very satisfied with the product! I&#x27;ve worn it twice and haven&#x27;t experienced any fallen hairs yet and it hasnt tangled, probably because its short. I got it for a cosplay (korra) and will warn you though that the wig&#x27;s dark brown color has a reddish tint to it. Either way it worked for me</li>
    <li> Pretty lovely wig :) I bought the curly black one, and it looks great! My only real complaint is what comes with all wigs, and that&#x27;s that it will get tangled if you don&#x27;t take good care of it! But that is of course a given. I had thought about cutting it a little shorter when I bought it, but as soon as I put it on, that idea went right out the window. I wear this wig pretty much everywhere. Most think it&#x27;s my real hair. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Great wig, not too shiny, hair is soft. Only problem is there are some places where it feels like the hair is matted like in front by where the bangs split. I wore it around for 8 hours and it was comfortable I recommend getting wig clips so it will stay on your head and not move. My roommate (a guy) thought I went to have my hair done he was completely fooled so I guess I can say it looks like real hair. I got this so I don&#x27;t have to dye my real hair back to a boring color in order to get a job. The color is really beautiful, its more of a warm brown and it has dimension to it def needs to be styled out of the box the bangs go to the right side of your face but it was easy to have them go the other way like I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> Fabulous wig! I wore it out and everyone thought it was my actual hair. The only complaint I have is there were a few short prickly sections of hair around the front of the cap but nothing too inconvenient.</li>
    <li> I love this wig.  The hair is soft and the haircut is modern!  It comes beautifully packaged.  Very happy!  Highly recommend both product and seller!  A++++++</li>
    <li> It is very full and the color was perfect for my cosplay. The fibers feel more natural than most of my other wigs. It really just needs styled now because the bangs are really long.</li>
    <li> Absolutely lovely wig.  I love how soft it is and the color is exactly what I wanted.  Ugh, if only my hair was this nice!  I did such a sloppy job trying it on and it still looked perfect.  It&#x27;s just so smooth and clean cut.  I almost feel bad shaping it (I&#x27;m using this for my Korra Book 4 cosplay).  Depending on how this wig is received in the public (when I go to the con), I might just have to wear this outside of conventions.  It&#x27;s just downright adorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from being adorable, it has a stiff mesh underneath it so it looks like it&#x27;ll last for quite some time.  The brush provided is perfect for combing this wig which I must add is extremely easy to do.  This wig doesn&#x27;t appear to be the type to knot and get all tangled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy.  And for the price I paid?  Er, let&#x27;s just say I couldn&#x27;t do better!  Highly recommend.  I&#x27;ll have to check out their other wigs for future cosplays :)</li>
    <li> I have to say this is a very good product for your money! Very light and comfortable to wear, feel like it is my own hair. It came with special comb and net. The style of the hair stay in the same shape and don&#x27;t even have to do anything with it except comb it lightly. Looks really natural. I have  wigs with real hair and they don&#x27;t look as nice as this one plus it cost me a lot more. So this is a good deal.</li>
