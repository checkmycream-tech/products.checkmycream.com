<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We love this lotion and I can only get it on amazon.</li>
    <li> Feels great on my very dry skin!  I wish the little take along sizes could be refilled with this great product.</li>
    <li> EOS is the very best lotion I have ever found. It soaks right into the skin without being greasy. I have purchased several of the EOS lotions for family and friends as gifts. They were as satisfied as I am with the lotion. EOS is now their only lotion they will use.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed by this product. I have used the EOS shaving cream and love it and figured I would also enjoy the rest of the line. This lotion was a huge let down for one specific reason. As the previous reviewer mentioned there are some questionable ingredients. My problem is only with the \\&quot;DMDM Hydantoin\\&quot;, not the others in this product. I read up about it from various sources across the web and discovered that it is a preservative that releases formaldehyde to create an unfavorable environment for bacterial growth. In some individuals there can be burning, itching, and a scaly skin reaction. I am unfortunately one who experienced a very uncomfortable burning sensation almost immediately after applying it. I do not consider myself to have sensitive skin and was very troubled by this since this advertises being 97% natural. I understand the need for preservatives in products but I am sure they could have chosen something else that doesn&#x27;t release formaldehyde to get the job done. That aside I liked the scent, it was fresh and clean and I preferred it to the other lotion fragrance which was more on the cucumber side. It had a really nice feel, very much like a gel lotion but closer to the lotion than the gel if that makes sense. My skin was soft prior to feeling like they were burning up. If you have any skin sensitivity issues I suggest passing on this product. Those with normal skin would in all likely-hood be just fine with this lotion. I wanted to love it but don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion for my hands and body I will definitely purchase again and recommend to my friends.</li>

    <li> I had gotten one of the small egg shaped examples of this lotion from a local super store.  Loved the cucumber version, by the way.  Product feels thin, but makes my skin very soft and smooth.  Lasts all day, so far as I have noticed.  Has a nice fragrance as well.  Will certainly purchase again-soon!</li>
    <li> I have used this for years because it is the perfect product for daytime. It&#x27;s not too heavy, the fragrance is light and my skin feels great. I am 53 and I am told often that I look years younger and I am sure part of it is due to being faithful using EOS. My daughter who is in her 20&#x27;s started early and loves it too!</li>
    <li> wife used it all need more</li>
    <li> I started with the shave gel and moved to the lip balm and now to the lotion.  I love all of them!!  I did not have any skin irritation at all.  This lotion leaves my skin feeling smooth and it&#x27;s not greasy.  I LOVE IT!  :)</li>
    <li> We love this lotion-it is not greasy.  The packaging is perfect, great value for price and it was delivered just as promised.  The price is very fair.</li>

    <li> I love EOS products and was so looking forward to this lotion I was even willing to pay more as it was 2.00 overprice.  Instead I was very disappointed as the smell was horrid. It smelled rancid and after looking into it the lotion indeed was expired. As evidenced by the stamp under the lotion. I would not buy again from this company, however they were willing to reimburse me right away.</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly and smells nice.</li>
    <li> This lotion seems to really pamper my skin.  since taking Plavix a few years ago, the skin on my arms felt like leather.  now that I am using EOS products, my skin is noticeably softer.  I am really impressed.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Also love the Nourish lotion from EOS.  Make my s kin feel great without leaving a sticky or smell residue.  I usually order two or three bottles at a time.  My granddaughter usually gets one of them.  Her favorite is the Nourish because it has a light scent.</li>

Great all-natural product and not too pricey and it works!!!  Try it....you will love it as well......</li>
    <li> order all the time, great stuff!  smells good too!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife.  Her hands frequently dry out and crack because she&#x27;s in the medical field and constantly washes her hands.  She likes this lotion.  It works and smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She isn&#x27;t crazy about the scent and it doesn&#x27;t provide real long lasting relief for extremely dry hands (which is probably because this lotion isn&#x27;t super thick), which is why I did not give the rating 5 stars.  However, for someone like me with semi-dry hands I believe this would be a great lotion.  It&#x27;s just not quite manly enough for me...</li>
