<li> THIS PRODUCT KEEPS MY HAIR FROM BEING FLAT ON MY HEAD..</li>

<li> Too bad.</li>
<li> WRONG!!!  </li>
<li> Besides not working the smell is AWFUL!!!  </li>
<li> PROMISE YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED!!</li>

    <li> Love this stuff. Works great. Just a little spray at the root of your hair after sectioning off dry as usual. It will give you the lift you need and it will last.  Has a nice smell that is not overwhelming, does not leave your hair sticky. Use it all the time</li>

    <li> I bought this after seeing it either on QVC or HSN.  It looked like it would perform miracles with limp hair.  WRONG!!!  I have seen it several time on the show and it does not do any of the things it says it would.  Besides not working the smell is AWFUL!!!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on it!</li>

    <li> This product works ok, however the smell is so awful it makes me want to get back in the shower and remove it. It smells like a mix of infant vomit and nail polish remover. I can&#x27;t finish the bottle, it&#x27;s THAT bad</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. I have thin hair and it really helps!  I really like this product!  I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
