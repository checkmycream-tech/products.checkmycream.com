      <li>The air leaks are gone and it is much more comfy.</li>
      <li>so it is a much better deal for me to pay this then the exorbitant price from the Dr. Office.</li>
      <li>fast delivery, great price.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll be getting more.....</li>
      <li>just great new mask makes world of diffrence.</li>
      <li>Top quality and easy to install</li>
      <li>Much better then the over priced insurance equivalent came very quickly and have been using it since</li>
      <li>It was the same as the item it was replacing so it fit perfectly on the mask.</li>
      <li>I am quite satisfied with this product as I have been using one for a time and like the fact it disassembles for easy cleaning and along with the liners makes a nice comfortable fit on my face.</li>
      <li>Right fit and good price</li>
      <li>very good and cheaper than medical store</li>
      <li>It is the most comfortable one I have ever used.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best price I could find and did the job,</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as described and shipping was extremely fast</li>
    <li> Good mask but tends to wear out less than 30 days. I will keep buying them anyway. Now I can Breathe.</li>
    <li> I was really happy to see that I could purchase this to replace my one without a prescription and the extra cost associated with that.  Additionally, it is a good way to refresh my mask without replacing the entire mask at a much higher cost.  I plan to purchase a couple more for my older mask making it a good spare now and one extra to have on hand.  Thanks for offering this product!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe the doctor&#x27;s office charged more than 6 times the price. You wander why the insurance rate are so sky high, it&#x27;s because of the rip off doctors. Right fit and good price</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t seem to last vey long...always need to replace too soon.  The mask breaks down within 48 hours of use...then it leaks😁</li>
    <li> Just as I expected and nice to have a spare.</li>
    <li> So much cheaper than getting it through insurance and seems softer and a better fit. Great delivery time too! I think this is a super product worth the money.</li>
    <li> new in packaging and correct match for ResMed Mirage Quattro mask (size medium)</li>
    <li> I love this mask!! It is the most comfortable one I have ever used. I will use it until they stop making it.</li>
    <li> Product was just as advertised</li>
    <li> Great Cushion it perfectly seals the mask, no leaks ever but after a few months of use it starts getting softer and yellow.</li>
    <li> Item is as posted, shipping fast and communications great A++++</li>
    <li> Its original equipment and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: The official guide says to replace it quite often.  That is very expensive if insurance is not paying.  Because it is made out of silicone the mask can be washed in the dishwasher when required and can also be patched with silicon from a tube that is readily available at most grocery stores, hardware stores or Kmart/Walmart.  This has exstended my masks life by years without any noticeable problems.</li>
    <li> Comfort. The mask fits well and seals pretty good over a beard (nothing is perfect with a beard). Air released by the make is fairly loud but not enough to affect sleep. In fact, it is sort of a white noise that kind of masks out ambient sounds and maybe makes sleeping easier.</li>
    <li> Good Produce. My husband doesn&#x27;t have any compliants.Purchashing from other companies have costed us more. In this day and time it is hard to fine these supplies at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> It fits my mask, delivery was fast, item was new, and price was right.</li>
    <li> The quality is good but the mask seems to be a bit bigger than the last medium we purchased.  It works fine though.</li>
    <li> Item purchased, arrived in new condition in original packaging. Price was a great value compared to the local medical supply. Shipping was quick as well.</li>
    <li> was just like the original and worked great</li>
    <li> As far as the quality, it&#x27;s the exact same thing you get no matter where you order it.... so price is the key. For 40 bucks, it was $15 less than other purchases I have made for the same mask. Prompt delivery!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use it. It cuts my face. The inner seal is quite a bit harder than any others I have owned and used. The cost on it was a really good savings, but in this case, I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Design of ResMed Mirage Quattro Full mask replacement is perfect and really should be replaced more often.  You know how we CPAP Bears are.  Don&#x27;t hesitate but search for best price and dealer as they change often.  Seller was fast and efficient.</li>
    <li> Works and fits great!  Just like the original.</li>
    <li> Sleep is sometimes under rated.  This type of CPAP mask seal helps me sleep well an has for years.  The plastic on this one seems a little thinner than the original but still works and forms a good seal.</li>
    <li> This was a great replacement for my CPAP mask. The mask was an exact fit into the mask that I have had for several years. I would recommend purchasing this vs. purchasing an entire new mask.</li>
    <li> It is perfect and it met my needs. It arrived quickly and it was so easy after trying to find it a locally unsuccessfully.</li>
    <li> This works as promised and I received it on time. By purchasing this from Amazon, I save a lot of money by only purchasing the face mask instead of the entire head gear.</li>
    <li> YES WAS PERFECT FOR MY SON EQUIPMENT</li>
    <li> We had the product for a week and the seal ripped and no longer works. Please fix this or help me.</li>
    <li> I love the item I would do bus\inrss again with resmed in the future again I tell others to trust resmed.</li>
    <li> The true best is ResMed. I have tried other no name brands and when you are thinking comfort and long lasting use, go with this. I like too that you can throw it in the washer to start fresh and clean. don&#x27;t dry it though</li>
    <li> Was a great replacement when my last Quattro ripped and became unusable. Clean with a baby shampoo or easy soap and this will last you a long time. Great mask to help you sleep with some peace of mind.</li>
    <li> Had air leaks so ordered new seal.  Still have air leaks.</li>
    <li> it fit good on my mask.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed, no need to replace the entire face mask every time, this is the part that touches your face, where the seal needs to be air-tight.  I highly recommend this piece, and this seller to all CPAP users.</li>
    <li> Fits well just like it is described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face seal is actually great to have as a backup for my original face seal has lasted over 2 years with cleaning.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit way less money than the company that maintains machine.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I need.  This is what my insurance pays for and the supplier charges 4-5 times more for it and I do not have to pay deductibles or co-pays here for it.</li>
    <li> I have two different masks. One reason. When travelling and if something goes wrong with one mask you have a back up. This Quattro is my main mask. Works well for me. Doesnt leak. Does the job day in and day out. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn a CPAP for about 10 years and am not good about replacing parts of my system on a timely basis.  Recently my wife told me that my mask was whistling and that it was waking her up.  Looking closely at the face seal I could see that it had lost some of its flexibility and probably wasn&#x27;t adhering properly to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered this as a replacement instead of getting a whole new mask--and saved a considerable amount of money. It was extremely easy to take out the old seal and replace it with this unit.  Works perfectly and no more complaints from the wife (at least about this issue).</li>
    <li> Just like the ones I had been buying from the high priced CPAP supply companies. It came in the ResMed packaging and fits like the others. My only complaint, which I did not deduct from the product rating, is that many of the health items are not coded properly to use an HSA or FSA card for payment. Between this and the headgear I purchased, I saved over 20 bucks.</li>
    <li> This is all I needed to replace to make the mask perform like new. I am very pleased with the quality and shipping and would order again.</li>
    <li> Exactly the same product that you get from your insurance paid supplier.  However, my insurance is only covering one of these every three months.  I have found I have to switch the cushion every 45 days to maintain a good seal because I have very oily skin.  So buying this from Amazon was the way to pay for what I need myself.</li>
    <li> That seal is always the first thing to go. We are poor folk and cannot afford a whole lot of frivolities, but I think my husband deserves good nights sleep! We were told by the store in our town that you have to have a prescription and charged way more than you all and for that, we appreciate you and will be coming to you for all of our CPAP supplies in the future.</li>
    <li> I am using this product now and it&#x27;s working fine. The thickness seems to be just fine.  It was made in Australia.</li>
    <li> the face seal works as described and is much cheaper on Amazon that on a medical website. This is the way to go</li>
    <li> the replacement parts fit my original mask beautifully. Works great. Wish I could have just purchased the face seal without the clip</li>
    <li> exactly the part that I needed.</li>
    <li> works beautifully for my boyfriends machine. Nice to know we can order replacement parts like this</li>
    <li> Excellent product, outstanding service!!</li>
    <li> Great to be able to order this replacement part for my mask on-line. It seems to &amp;#34;wear out&amp;#34; after awhile. The seal just is not as good, and the seal itself takes on a cloudy appearance. It is easy to swap this part out on the masks, and then I am good to go.</li>
    <li> My mask fits me much better than my old torn one and my wife can get a better nights sleep with me in the room. Thanks for a better nights rest.</li>
    <li> The only thing wrong is that it is not as heavy rubber we will see if it lasts as long as the other ones</li>
    <li> It fits as advertised and seals just like it should.  Will buy again, as it is cheaper this route.  Word</li>
    <li> Not happy! I&#x27;ve ordered this before but from another seller and it was great. I didnt need a new one for a year. But this one was made of a different material it seems more plastic instead of silicone. Have to have it real tight on my face so it doesn&#x27;t leak air when I move. Not happy need find anther one.</li>
    <li> fast delivery, great price.</li>
    <li> Same thing as ResMed full face mask my local CPAP supplier sells and much cheaper, even when insurance is taken into consideration this is a much less expensive option.</li>
    <li> Exactly what was expected.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered at the best price. And a fast delivery to boot. Very happy customer.</li>
    <li> Since It is new and the actual brand, vs. a &#x27;knock-off&#x27;, it was exactly what I needed and is perfect.  And the price was definitely right!</li>
    <li> I have sleep apnea, this works.</li>
    <li> IT IS WHAT IT IS A GOOD SEAL, DOES IT&#x27;S JOB</li>
    <li> Awesome, feels like a brand new mask!!!</li>
    <li> I was overjoyed to find this sleep apnia product for such a great price on Amazon.com and I ordered needing the replacement parts for my ResMed mask.  The seller was quick to send me an email that indicated that the product was ready to ship, but I noticed that I never did get a shipping confirmation.  Turns out that there is a difference between a seller letting the shipping company know that they WILL get an order to ship and actually shipping.  After the deadline for delivery had passed ( I waited an entire extra week) I finally contacted the seller, who after several days responded to my email and indicated that they were sorry, but they were out of stock on my item when I purchased it.  It would have been better had they let me know that right away instead of making me wait for the product.  I had to initiate the conversation to discover this fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is the bad...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the good...  The seller asked me if I wished to streceiveieve my order.  I said yes, as the price was quite attractive for these supplies.  The seller said that they would DOUBLE MY ORDER if I continued.  Of course, I said yes,  They doubled the order and it arrived in a very timely fashion.  The parts were just what I needed and factory original, sealed, etc., as one would expect.  I was PLEASED at the response of the seller and they did all that they could to make good with the sale.  I will try them again when I need replacement parts.</li>
    <li> Sure beat the price locally!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase.  It&#x27;s exactly what I expected and will be sure to purchase this again.</li>
    <li> good quality fast shipping</li>
    <li> Perfect fit and good customer service</li>
    <li> This was just the replacement part for my CPAP mask.  It works just fine.  I had no problem replacing it on the mask.</li>
    <li> Top quality and easy to install</li>
    <li> We had to change insurance carriers and were happy to find these on Amazon for a little better price and a lot faster shipment than from the old medical supplier.  Thanks Amazon.  My husband uses the Mirage Quattro Full facemask.  He is fairly satisfied, but I did not like this style - too bulky and confining and just didn&#x27;t fit my face so it leaked horribly.  I was happy to find another mask.</li>
    <li> Fit was perfect, worked well with my mask. Def would recommend. If you have the need to replace your this one works</li>
    <li> My CPAP supplier would only replace the full mask...Complete masks do not need to be replace, but just the Full Face Seal...&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I purchased it from Amazon...THANK YOU</li>
    <li> This was a gift and the person said it is perfect.</li>
    <li> I was worried that ordering this from someone other than my normal insurance provider that this would be some sort of a knockoff mask cushions,  but these masks  were the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> Good idea, but doesn&#x27;t work well in practice. Hard to get a good seal, fabric covers eyes, hole is too large and difficult to locate relative to mask. Difficult to hold fabric in place and place mask on face while attaching clips on retainer.</li>
    <li> horrible gasket. it got ripped up in a manner of days...and that&#x27;s why I ordered a new one!</li>
    <li> This is way better than paying for the same exact face seal from the Dr. Office and paying the almost three times the price.  Even with shipping this is still so much cheaper.  Same exact item and it ships really quick.  I need my face seals replaced rather often so it is a much better deal for me to pay this then the exorbitant price from the Dr. Office.</li>
    <li> Great fit and even better price compared to the local supply company! Good shipping, would reorder!</li>
    <li> This was the a great buy.  I didn&#x27;t have the hassle of dealing with the local store and insurance nonsense.  If you itemize your taxes, this is a deductible expense.</li>
    <li> Exact fit replacement.</li>
    <li> This mask works great for me. It is exactly the same one I can get from my Sleep Doc at about 3/4 the cost. And I don&#x27;t have to have a $100 office visit to get it.</li>
    <li> My supplies were/and are costing me a fortune. My mask I can clean and sanitize reguarly, but the seal would always be the problem for me after it started to break down. My supplier would not sell the seal alone, but have to purchase the whole mask/seal/headgear in one package. Not anymore! No more will I be going to the supplier to get an exspensive mask every 3 months when I only need the seal and now have an inexspensive option! The shipping was incredibly fast as well. I am very pleased that I made this purchase!</li>
    <li> Has a true fit and seems to work just like the original.  I would recommend this to anyone needing a replacement cushion.</li>
    <li> It was exactly the one I wanted and it makes a huge difference in my sleeping at night. Keep up the good work..........Thanks.</li>
    <li> The item was as described and fit perfectly. It was the same as the item it was replacing so it fit perfectly on the mask.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great price and product!!</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced, product was exactly as advertised, my husband was very pleased with it, will order again if need another one</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Both came on time and exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> It is half of the mask.  The part that seals to your face.  Not the whole face mask and no straps.  As described but read the description carefully.</li>
    <li> it was a little to big for my face  air still get out make a sound</li>
    <li> Saving money on what you need to breathe is even better! Buying this item here saved me at least 50% over anyone elses price!</li>
    <li> The price was great for this mask. Much better then the over priced insurance equivalent came very quickly and have been using it since</li>
    <li> great price nice Quality</li>
    <li> received on time. item fits mask perfectly</li>
    <li> this was one of the fastest order I have ever got. mask is  great and I&#x27;ll be getting more..... thanks a lot</li>
    <li> Received within a few days and saved me a lot of money and was the name brand I use,great transaction.</li>
    <li> Excellent prduct. Fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly and so much cheaper than the full mask.  I just wish it came in a kit with the headgear.</li>
    <li> It was a good product at a good price... it does what i need it to do. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Something in the fit of nose bridge area has changed wore a blister first night. This area is different than old seal.</li>
    <li> exactly as described.</li>
    <li> These masks don&#x27;t seem to last as long as other masks that I have had. I&#x27;ve had a hard time getting them to seal. After having a full face mask for years, I finally bought one that just goes in the nose and I love it.</li>
    <li> Just like the ones you get at the local medical supply store for $100.</li>
    <li> the product was just what i ordered giving me some much needed rest. and it came on time. fit perfect</li>
    <li> Happy I could find the individual parts without having to purchase an entire unit each time. Now able to afford to keep unit fresh. Fast service,  free shipping,  and best price. Will purchase from this seller again in future and recommend to others as well.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife&#x27;s CPAP machine. The price was good and she was excited to replace her older and dirtier mask with this new one. Nice to know where we can go to get replacements without any trouble. She is very happy, so you know what that means for me.....but that&#x27;s another story.</li>
    <li> exactly what was needed.</li>
    <li> as described very happy</li>
    <li> A good replacement device for your mask.  Installation is a breeze and it works like a new mask.  Good product!</li>
    <li> Delivered on time worked great</li>
    <li> Excellent full face mask.  I&#x27;m a woman with a long face and this is comfortable and provides a good seal.</li>
    <li> Big savings. This is the second one I&#x27;ve ordered and will keep ordering it my insurance doesn&#x27;t cover them and they need to be replaced ever 2 month. Kind of wish the seal would last longer.very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is a good value, and a cost savings for me.</li>
    <li> After trying several other masks, I&#x27;ve found the one that suits me most.  I fall asleep and stay asleep as long as I properly clean my skin and keep the mask clean per instructions.  Whisper quiet...</li>
    <li> this was shipped very fast but it arrived in a soft mailer and the clip was broken but I just used my old one.</li>
    <li> The face seal with clip works perfectly and this way of ordering must much more efficient and cheaper than using a local home medical device provider.  I was able to order in bulk which was great!</li>
    <li> Worked well for a while but now it doesn&#x27;t seem to fit correctly. Leaks like crazy :( had to go back to the old seal. It does have less material on the cushion so maybe that&#x27;s why?</li>
    <li> This is exactly the same item my CPAP supplier charges my insurance company $189.42 for. My insurance company then discounts the item by $119.42, leaving me to have to pay $70.00 for it. My insurance company is then happy to tell me they have saved me 63% for it. Yep. I&#x27;m definitly happy to buy 2 for less then the one my supplier &amp; insurance company are providing</li>
    <li> The rubber piece feels a bit thin and does not seem to withstand the same amount of pressure as the original mask</li>
    <li> Rubber face area collapsed within a month. Almost like it was used.</li>
    <li> seal is not quite as good as the factory seal that came with my machine</li>
    <li> Nice product very slow shipping</li>
    <li> CPAP supplies are very expensive. This cushion goes for $51. Thankfully, this seller sells it for only $35.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that they should be replaced every month.&lt;br /&gt;I generally am able to milk about 3 months out of them.&lt;br /&gt;What a huge difference a new cushion makes. The air leaks are gone and it is much more comfy.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping new product</li>
    <li> Is a resmed oem part...perfect!</li>
    <li> great product received it quickly</li>
    <li> As expected and half the price of my local store. I&#x27;ll be ordering another one as soon as this one wears out.</li>
    <li> Replacement mask seals work as expected</li>
    <li> This model is exactly what I used to get through my company insurance. With the recent changes in coverage, this beats the B.S. required by our new Insurance carrier and their partners. Medical Insurance in bed with profit oriented Physicians is organized crime.</li>
    <li> As described, great value. good shipping.</li>
    <li> Order was delivered as told and product was great way to save money on something my husband depends on daily</li>
    <li> The Clip Fitts great works wonderfull dont know what i would do with out it everyone should have a extra one on hand just incase</li>
    <li> works great it comes with the green piece to i had to end up going to a small masked instead but this works great</li>
    <li> CHEAP MATERIALS AND TOO EXPENSIVE FOR A  WORTHY PRODUCT. GET SMART, AMAZON, YOU ARE BEING TAKEN!!!! joe n</li>
    <li> I am quite satisfied with this product as I have been using one for a time and like the fact it disassembles for easy cleaning and along with the liners makes a nice comfortable fit on my face.</li>
    <li> Just as promised - fast shipping as well.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the real deal and I am sleeping much better</li>
    <li> Needed this bad and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Good product! Very competitive price...</li>
    <li> very good and cheaper than medical store</li>
    <li> Great fit product arrived promptly, and now I can sleep well.</li>
    <li> Mask seems a bit small if coming from a F&amp;P, but it comfortable.</li>
    <li> just great new mask makes world of diffrence. The noise and leaks are gone. I would by this from here again.</li>
