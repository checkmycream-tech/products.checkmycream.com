      <li>it was a great price and came on time&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It does do a great job pulling the muscles together and help my diastasis recti heal.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this is a good way of dealing with the clients.  </li>
      <li>I bought both and loved them.</li>
      <li>the wrap didn&#x27;t even hold good and made everything look lop sided.</li>
      <li>This is a good product.  </li>
      <li>If you are able to get the appropriate size it works wonderful.</li>
      <li>the top otherwise great item and</li>
      <li>my daughter is really enjoying  great price too will recommend it a lot to our friends and family</li>
      <li>I got a cheaper one at Walmart and it worked better than this!</li>
      <li>I am one happy customer, exactly as described, and delivered on time!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s breathable and very comfortable.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s excellent; but, I have to wear a sports ab binder first, right below my breasts, and then I put this on, lower, at my tummy&#x27;s level.</li>
      <li>I love the Velcro straps for adjusting tightness.</li>
      <li>Product was ok.</li>
      <li>Works better than work out bands.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>really wanted to love this product and in the beginning it was great.</li>
      <li>I love it....</li>
      <li>, it slims and shapes your waist, but the &amp;#34;meat&amp;#34; moves horribly above it.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, great!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not uncomfortable for a corset either and gives you a good posture.</li>
      <li>It has been about 4 hours and so far it is great.</li>
      <li>It was very useful.l loved it.</li>
      <li>Straps make it easy to adjust pressure in featured areas.</li>
      <li>otherwise it feels comfortable and breathable like it says.</li>
      <li>, I was a size 3 before my pregnancy and although it would have fit me</li>
      <li>However, the additional ancillary strips on the belt help tighten it in just the right spots and make it more comfortable.  </li>
      <li>because if I don&#x27;t wear the sports one higher, I look like a &amp;#34;hamburger&amp;#34; with all the meat rolls sticking out at the top of this postpartum belt.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
      <li>i was excited to get this in the mail.</li>
      <li>I was excited to get this slimming belt.</li>
      <li>The ItaMed for the first 4 weeks because it offers the most compression and the Alphabrace for after the first 4 weeks because it&#x27;s more comfortable and more flexible so you can wear it under clothes when you leave the house.</li>
      <li>very god for exersize comfortable 5 star....</li>
      <li>Is it worth it?...??  </li>
      <li>well worth the money</li>
      <li>Got the belt today and put it on right away.</li>
      <li>so while yes, it cinches things up, it also squishes everything out the bottom and top, giving whole new meaning to the phrase &amp;#34;hour-glass figure.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also thinner than most back braces so does slenderize under clothes.  </li>
      <li>I have to try to find different spots to attach the velcro that haven&#x27;t been used so much yet, but then it doesn&#x27;t fit right.</li>
      <li>So if you are large you need a large</li>
      <li>For me, I can wrap the main piece around comfortably and am able to fasten the extra straps just in the middle of my tummy.</li>
      <li>All of those girdles slide up somewhat because that&#x27;s just the nature of our body shape, so I didn&#x27;t expect much there.</li>
      <li>Since I am an XS, I went ahead and ordered it, but I would say if you are anything bigger than a S, it won&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t cover much skin.</li>
      <li>it really doesn&#x27;t wrap is</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
      <li>In fact, when wearing over a cami, it really doesn&#x27;t slide up more than any other item I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Due to the bending, it now also slides up more.</li>
      <li>and it fit a little snug, but the purpose is not for it to fit loose or that comfortable.</li>
      <li>OK, shortly after I had the response  from the seller who suggested to just give the binder/belt to someone as a gift (!)</li>
      <li>Very comfortable and does not roll down!</li>
      <li>i love how tight it can get.</li>
      <li>Also, the velcro of the straps has pulled off so many fibers of the middle panel, that the velcro barely holds anymore and constantly opens.</li>
      <li>This was labeled as \\&quot;New\\&quot; but there is no way that this was new.</li>
      <li>I found item marked size M which appeared to be rather size S than</li>
      <li>and I really needed it for my physical therapy sessions.</li>
      <li>It sucks you in, but then the fat pushes up to the upper abs.feels good to my back also</li>
      <li>and it had tiny hairs near the velcro!</li>
      <li>so when I wore it I could barely breathe</li>
      <li>However, the velcro closures barely meet on me.</li>

<li> However, the velcro closures barely meet on me.</li>
<li> Thick u will get hot...</li>
<li> just is like a wide belt with a very short over lap velcro tab.  </li>
<li> This item is almost certainly a grey market item, since is not labeled for sale in the US.  </li>
<li> it barely goes around my waste and i am a petite person.</li>
<li> was not what I expected</li>
<li> There is absolutely no way to get the strapping to come anywhere close to even my belly button, let alone to wrap around my abdomen as shown.</li>
<li> I usually saran wrap my waist and then wear it for an extra sweat.</li>
<li> Not worth it if you get abused by a product that supposed to help you.</li>
<li> The only complaint I have is that it rolls a little n</li>
<li> Now the big front panel is bending to a valley in the middle and has uncomfortable creases.</li>
<li> but it came too small when it says one size fits all it only means if your a size small</li>
<li> but didn&#x27;t have a size chart, didn&#x27;t fit me :(</li>
<li> is just a waste of money.</li>
<li> The velcro on this degraded after a few weeks</li>
<li> this is wasted money if you&#x27;re anything over a size 3</li>
<li> /&gt;un-useable now, waste of money</li>
<li> I realized that is not easy to return the item now</li>
<li> It&#x27;s snug a maybe a little on the small side.  </li>
<li> As all other reviewers mention, the sizing of this is very small.</li>
<li> Runs small.</li>
<li> ordered correct size and put on according to picture instructions but the two velcro outer straps failed after the 3rd day of wear.  </li>
<li> It was too small</li>
<li> I usually wear it when I work out.</li>
<li> I doubt anyone othet than a Small could use</li>
<li> It also feels like its stabbing you in the back.</li>
<li> The metal rods in the back were painful because they kept stabbing me in the back and one broke through the fabric and came our of the wrap.</li>
<li> It made my hips look bigger, like all my belly fat was pushed towards my hips and whatever wasn&#x27;t underneath the wrap stuck out so badly.</li>
<li> The quality is very poor.</li>
<li> Upon opening the belly binder I was shocked to see it was dirty</li>
<li> This item was horrible.</li>
<li> It rides up, very uncomfortable!!!</li>
<li> Disgusting!</li>
<li> /&gt;The sizing is also terrible.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Thick u will get hot... Is it worth it?...??  Up to u. Me wore it once.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this slimming belt. Appeared to be well constructed and probably breathable however unwearable by me. Instead size L I found item marked size M which appeared to be rather size S than M. Well, I wanted to return this item, but my request, via Amazon,  was pending for approval from the sender. I realized that is not easy to return the item now since I thought that I had to wait for the mailing slip.  OK, shortly after I had the response  from the seller who suggested to just give the binder/belt to someone as a gift (!) instead of sending it back for exchange, considering the cost of mailing it back to China. I don&#x27;t think this is a good way of dealing with the clients.  No, I will not recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> Disgusting! This was labeled as \\&quot;New\\&quot; but there is no way that this was new. Upon opening the belly binder I was shocked to see it was dirty and it had tiny hairs near the velcro! I wish we could upload photos of the items we buy.&lt;br /&gt;Also I have to say, I was a size 3 before my pregnancy and although it would have fit me okay (if I wasn&#x27;t grossed out I might have used it) I doubt anyone othet than a Small could use it.&lt;br /&gt;Go with the ItaMed or the Alphabrace! I bought both and loved them. The ItaMed for the first 4 weeks because it offers the most compression and the Alphabrace for after the first 4 weeks because it&#x27;s more comfortable and more flexible so you can wear it under clothes when you leave the house.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  Based on the sizing chart I went one size smaller then I thought I would be.  It&#x27;s snug a maybe a little on the small side.  However, the additional ancillary strips on the belt help tighten it in just the right spots and make it more comfortable.  I have worn it out to dinner after giving birth without being self-conscious.</li>
    <li> very good item my daughter is really enjoying  great price too will recommend it a lot to our friends and family</li>
    <li> it barely goes around my waste and i am a petite person. not at all what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> Product was ok. but didn&#x27;t have a size chart, didn&#x27;t fit me :(</li>
    <li> It couldn&#x27;t be perfect, I guess. It&#x27;s excellent; but, I have to wear a sports ab binder first, right below my breasts, and then I put this on, lower, at my tummy&#x27;s level. Why? because if I don&#x27;t wear the sports one higher, I look like a &amp;#34;hamburger&amp;#34; with all the meat rolls sticking out at the top of this postpartum belt.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it slims and shapes your waist, but the &amp;#34;meat&amp;#34; moves horribly above it.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, great!</li>
    <li> It was very useful.l loved it. After my pregnancy my belly was fat ,after using this I am back to my pre pregnancy shape.now I can wear any attire..I love it....</li>
    <li> It rides up, very uncomfortable!!! It also feels like its stabbing you in the back. Makes you not want to wear it! Waist of money!</li>
    <li> it was a great price and came on time&lt;br /&gt;I ordered correct size and put on according to picture instructions but the two velcro outer straps failed after the 3rd day of wear.  I only stayed home, I did not do strenuous or any overactive movements to strain the straps.  the side seams have also started to fray and unravel badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;un-useable now, waste of money</li>
    <li> I have back issues. This is perfect. It&#x27;s breathable and very comfortable.  It&#x27;s also thinner than most back braces so does slenderize under clothes.  It&#x27;s been a great help.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I wanted the wrap didn&#x27;t even hold good and made everything look lop sided. Don&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> This band worked perfectly! I love the Velcro straps for adjusting tightness. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone post pregnancy recovery</li>
    <li> Metel rods (corset) hurts and digs into my back so im looking for all spandex if your use to corsets then this is for you</li>
    <li> This item is almost certainly a grey market item, since is not labeled for sale in the US.  The tags were not in English.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sizing is also terrible.  I&#x27;m a size 12, so was expecting it to be somewhat on the tighter side.  However, the velcro closures barely meet on me. There is absolutely no way to get the strapping to come anywhere close to even my belly button, let alone to wrap around my abdomen as shown.</li>
    <li> very god for exersize comfortable 5 star....</li>
    <li> Runs small. It sucks you in, but then the fat pushes up to the upper abs.feels good to my back also</li>
    <li> This item was horrible. There was no size indicated. It was too small so when I wore it I could barely breathe and it didn&#x27;t really work. I got a cheaper one at Walmart and it worked better than this!</li>
    <li> The only complaint I have is that it rolls a little n the top otherwise great item and well worth the money</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and does not roll down! beats the belly bandit. Straps make it easy to adjust pressure in featured areas.</li>
    <li> It seems that all the complaints for this item seems to be on the size. I have about a 38 inch waist and it fit a little snug, but the purpose is not for it to fit loose or that comfortable. I would definitely check with the buyer prior to purchasing this item for a different size if you need it, because it is not an all size fits all. If you are able to get the appropriate size it works wonderful. I usually wear it when I work out. I usually saran wrap my waist and then wear it for an extra sweat. Works better than work out bands.</li>
    <li> Got the belt today and put it on right away. It has been about 4 hours and so far it is great. I got it to help fix my diastasis recti. Buying the product I could not find what size it was but got it anyway. I am a size 6 and it fits well.</li>
    <li> As all other reviewers mention, the sizing of this is very small. Since I am an XS, I went ahead and ordered it, but I would say if you are anything bigger than a S, it won&#x27;t fit. For me, I can wrap the main piece around comfortably and am able to fasten the extra straps just in the middle of my tummy. The way that the product picture shows it with the straps wrapped around the entire front, the model must be a size XXXS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to love this product and in the beginning it was great. It does do a great job pulling the muscles together and help my diastasis recti heal. It&#x27;s not uncomfortable for a corset either and gives you a good posture. All of those girdles slide up somewhat because that&#x27;s just the nature of our body shape, so I didn&#x27;t expect much there. In fact, when wearing over a cami, it really doesn&#x27;t slide up more than any other item I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after wearing it 12 hours daily for a month, the product is deteriorating. Now the big front panel is bending to a valley in the middle and has uncomfortable creases. Due to the bending, it now also slides up more. Also, the velcro of the straps has pulled off so many fibers of the middle panel, that the velcro barely holds anymore and constantly opens. I have to try to find different spots to attach the velcro that haven&#x27;t been used so much yet, but then it doesn&#x27;t fit right. I&#x27;m gonna try to upload some picture to show those issues.</li>
    <li> It made my hips look bigger, like all my belly fat was pushed towards my hips and whatever wasn&#x27;t underneath the wrap stuck out so badly. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anybody.</li>
    <li> worked only for 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;This is just a waste of money. The quality is very poor.</li>
    <li> this is the most uncomfortable thing i&#x27;ve ever worn. and it doesn&#x27;t cover much skin. so while yes, it cinches things up, it also squishes everything out the bottom and top, giving whole new meaning to the phrase &amp;#34;hour-glass figure.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I do like the material but it came too small when it says one size fits all it only means if your a size small otherwise it feels comfortable and breathable like it says.</li>
    <li> This was something that you have to be small enough to get around you in the first place.  it really doesn&#x27;t wrap is just is like a wide belt with a very short over lap velcro tab.  So if you are large you need a large then it doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> the biggest size i ordered is sized way smaller than what the package claims. this is wasted money if you&#x27;re anything over a size 3</li>
    <li> i was excited to get this in the mail. i wanted to get my shape back since i had a baby. i love how tight it can get. The metal rods in the back were painful because they kept stabbing me in the back and one broke through the fabric and came our of the wrap. I would look into a different wrap if i were you</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the way the wires come out and jug you in the side.  Not worth it if you get abused by a product that supposed to help you.</li>
    <li> The velcro on this degraded after a few weeks and I really needed it for my physical therapy sessions. I would not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I am one happy customer, exactly as described, and delivered on time!</li>
    <li> was not what I expected</li>
</ol>
