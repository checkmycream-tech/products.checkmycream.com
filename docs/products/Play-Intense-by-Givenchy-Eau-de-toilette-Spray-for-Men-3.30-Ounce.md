### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great fragrance!</li>
      <li>Great price!</li>
      <li>This is one of the best smelling colognes I have ever had!</li>
      <li>Top-notch customer service on their end!</li>
      <li>Excellent delivered, but the smell is not what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>Very good smelling cologne</li>
      <li>I ordered this based on the great price</li>
      <li>Great stuff.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this cologne before and was very pleased.</li>
      <li>Many colognes are really not that great on me, but this one is EXCELLENT for my scent type.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know if they rebranded Play or if I was getting the cologne I used to have (which I liked better because it wasn&#x27;t as overpowering.  </li>
      <li>Super fast shipping and an excellent purchase!</li>
      <li>It has caribean wood in it which is an elegant scent.</li>
      <li>love the fragrance, just question the quality of the bottle I got from Amazon.</li>
      <li>AND I CHANGE MY REVIEW. :-)</li>
      <li>Love this cologne.</li>
      <li>it is my favorite.</li>
      <li>You will love it too.  </li>
      <li>The clearest giveaway that it isn&#x27;t the authentic product is a knock-off is that authentic product has Givenchy imprinted in the bottom of the housing for the spray.</li>
      <li>Very distinct scent.</li>
      <li>I have tons of great scents, but this one is unique and is nothing like my other favorite&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>Always make sure to buy a cologne, that suits your personal scent/ body type/ smell.</li>
      <li>This can confuse many people, and when comparing to the original Play, the bottle looks the same, but the products are slightly different (stronger intense smell)</li>
      <li>I have tried over 50 different types, and I am still coming back for more!</li>
      <li>Givenchy Play Intense.</li>
      <li>but we were really surprised when it arrived as it was part of a gift set which was such a lovely surprise</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this fragrance a few times and the scent is great, the juice is fresh and current, the scent last 8 plus hours on my skin and days on my clothes if I dont wash them.</li>
      <li>Also, in terms of packaging, the interior of your box should be all black, contain an imprinted logo inside the box top, and the bar-code on your box should be part of the packaging and NEVER a peel and stick label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Intense vs. the original has a little hint of vanilla at first... but fades as it slowly wears off.  </li>

<li> My husband has had Givenchy Play Intense in his fragrance lineup for quite some time, and the product we received was definitely NOT authentic.</li>
<li> They were likely unaware they had partnered with a shady seller...</li>
<li> I had read a few reviews before purchasing this product from Amazon that some people felt like the smell didn&#x27;t last as long as it would if you had purchased from a department store.  </li>
<li> This product picture is not accurate and needs to be changed .. the box is correct, but the bottle in the picture is not the same as what comes in the box.</li>
<li> The dark horse of all dark horses.</li>
<li> but when I received the last one the smell didn&#x27;t last as long and seemed to be slightly off but not in a bad way.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s usual potency.  </li>
<li> Lasts a long time, so you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>

    <li> Great fragrance! Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> You will love it too.  My lady melted once she smelled it and became glued to my neck for the rest of the night.  Nuff said. I have tons of great scents, but this one is unique and is nothing like my other favorite&#x27;s.  Lasts a long time, so you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this cologne before and was very pleased. It is not overpowering and I receive compliments when I wear it. It has a scent that can be used at work or for a night out on the town. The scent lasts all day. I would rate it a 5 but when I received the last one the smell didn&#x27;t last as long and seemed to be slightly off but not in a bad way. It has caribean wood in it which is an elegant scent.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Constantly getting compliments when I wear it. Very distinct scent. The Intense vs. the original has a little hint of vanilla at first... but fades as it slowly wears off.  Lasts all day too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this fragrance a few times and the scent is great, the juice is fresh and current, the scent last 8 plus hours on my skin and days on my clothes if I dont wash them.</li>
    <li> The dark horse of all dark horses. The effect of wearing this scent is like being made of chocolate and leaving a trail of money wherever you walk. Wear with caution.</li>
    <li> JUST LIKE I USED TO BUY AT THE DEPARTMENT STORE</li>
    <li> Excellent delivered, but the smell is not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> My husband has had Givenchy Play Intense in his fragrance lineup for quite some time, and the product we received was definitely NOT authentic. The clearest giveaway that it isn&#x27;t the authentic product is a knock-off is that authentic product has Givenchy imprinted in the bottom of the housing for the spray. If it is lacking that imprint, it&#x27;s a scam. Also, in terms of packaging, the interior of your box should be all black, contain an imprinted logo inside the box top, and the bar-code on your box should be part of the packaging and NEVER a peel and stick label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to Amazon for their immediate refund to my account though! Top-notch customer service on their end! They were likely unaware they had partnered with a shady seller...</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on the great price but we were really surprised when it arrived as it was part of a gift set which was such a lovely surprise</li>
    <li> I have bought this product before, from Yonkers. It is about $20 to $30 cheaper on amazon! Very good smelling cologne it is my favorite.</li>
    <li> This product picture is not accurate and needs to be changed .. the box is correct, but the bottle in the picture is not the same as what comes in the box. This can confuse many people, and when comparing to the original Play, the bottle looks the same, but the products are slightly different (stronger intense smell) I didn&#x27;t know if they rebranded Play or if I was getting the cologne I used to have (which I liked better because it wasn&#x27;t as overpowering.  CORRECT THE PICTURE AND I CHANGE MY REVIEW. :-)</li>
    <li> This is one of the best smelling colognes I have ever had! I have tried over 50 different types, and I am still coming back for more! This is my 4th bottle of this stuff. I refuse to leave the house without smelling like Givenchy Play Intense. I get constantly asked on what type of cologne it is. Yes, even men ask me!</li>
    <li> I had read a few reviews before purchasing this product from Amazon that some people felt like the smell didn&#x27;t last as long as it would if you had purchased from a department store.  Now I don&#x27;t know if that was just stuck in the back of my mind or what, but I too felt like the fragrance didn&#x27;t have it&#x27;s usual potency.  I have used the cologne before and it is definitely one that will have the ladies all over you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fragrance, just question the quality of the bottle I got from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne. Great price!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and an excellent purchase!</li>
    <li> Always make sure to buy a cologne, that suits your personal scent/ body type/ smell. Many colognes are really not that great on me, but this one is EXCELLENT for my scent type.</li>
