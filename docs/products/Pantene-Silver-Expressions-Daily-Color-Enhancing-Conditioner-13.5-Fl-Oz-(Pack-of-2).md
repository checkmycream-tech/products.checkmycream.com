<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this stuff - makes my &amp;#34;wash away&amp;#34; color last longer and look better.</li>
    <li> Conditioner holds color, helps to cover gray and keeps hair shiney.&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo is just as good or better.  My favorite hair products.</li>
    <li> I ordered both the shampoo and the conditioner from Amazon. Wall mart does not carry this product all the time. It does not burn your scalp, like most others do. The MAIN reason I buy this product is that it darkens light brown hair, to a dark brown. If my hair is sun-damaged, this conditioner will darken it. It does nothing for grey hair, this product only darkens your brown hair. This product is just a temporary coloring, and will wash out using other shampoos. The more I use it, the darker my hair becomes, which is what I like. I also use the Pantene Pro-V Brunette shampoo. [[ASIN:B001F51V9S Pantene Pro-V Brunette Expressions Daily Color Enhancing Shampoo with Liquid Crystals, 13-Ounce (Pack of 3)]]</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t suit my hair - leaves my wavy/curly hair frizzy and quickly leaves build-up. You get what you pay for here.</li>
    <li> Smells great and a very nice conditioner!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It conditions without leaving a residue. It&#x27;s gentle on color treated hair. Used with the shampoo and my color treated hair is in excellent condition, shiny and manageable. My hair is natural curly so has a tendency to get dry and frizzy. Don&#x27;t have that problem using this conditioner daily.</li>
    <li> Love the smell on my wife.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for years. It works great on my extremely long hair and it smells absolutely amazing. I will continue to buy this! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a good product it keeps my hair color lasting longer.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! It is very inexpensive, yet it conditions and keeps my hair color from fading between my appointments. I wash my hair, put on the conditioner, then shower. By that time, it&#x27;s been on my hair long enough to do it&#x27;s work.</li>
    <li> My favorie shampoo.  Helps with my red hair not making it brassie. Hate you can never find it in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice conditioner, good quality, and extends the life of my hair coloring.  I don&#x27;t want to beat my hair too much and color any more often than needed.  This conditioner definitely makes a difference and stretches out the time in between.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner and sometimes its hard to find in the stores. I got this as a 3 pack deal and I am very satisfied with the value.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased to find this. It has become extremely hard to find this particular Pantene product anymore! It&#x27;s the best! If you wan&#x27;t silk smooth hair that is healthy ALWAYS this is the real deal. Hairdressers are amazed when I tell them what product I use. Now, my daughter will not use ANYTHING else. I have to ship it to her at College every few months!</li>
    <li> work&#x27;s very good on brunette hair in between hair color if used along with Pantene Brunette Daily color enhancing shampoo</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay,  It does keep my hair soft and smells good. I recommend it for burnettes to buy it for their hair.</li>
    <li> Works great with shampoo.  I use it every day and I swear it makes my gray hairs blends in and look browner.</li>
    <li> Pantene Brunettes is the only shampoo and hair conditioner I buy.  I love it.</li>
    <li> love this product. Only place I could find it seems to be out of production. Hope they have enough in stock before I need to stop using it because I turn grey.</li>
    <li> It does everything it promises. Leaves the hair feeling beautiful. Will buy it again. It makes my color last longer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product twice and it has totally transformed my hair. So silky, soft and smooth and very shiny. My color is the same so far, not richer or deeper as they claim but I don&#x27;t care. This is the best my hair has ever felt or looked!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product. I couldn&#x27;t find it in other stores. Very good product</li>
    <li> Great for getting out tangles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pantene products for 25+ years.  They work great for my hair, and I &amp;#60;LOVE&amp;#62; the Brunette Expressions line.  I hate that the stores don&#x27;t carry these any longer, but am grateful that Amazon &amp; its sellers still have it so I can continue using this product.</li>
