<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Received the White safe sticks in great condition. They look and smell amazing. Very pleased with the product and plan to order more!!</li>
    <li> Wife bought it. Don&#x27;t know what it does or is.  She apparently likes it.</li>
    <li> will re buy again great quality.</li>
    <li> The white sage packs I received were perfect. The fragrant aroma even before I took the out of the packaging was so soothing to me. I used it as soon as I got them. The burn very well.</li>
    <li> I was delightfully surprised that the size of each bundle was about twice what I was expecting! My Reiki students were also delighted by the quality and size of this product.</li>
    <li> Lasts a LONG time. Very clean and pure, great for purifying the area. Definately will buy more when I finally do run out- even after giving one to my grandparents.</li>
    <li> No Complaints, perfect, I do recommend buying a bowl, only because a piece of the sage fell &amp; burnt a small hole in my carpet. Wonderful product. Very fresh.</li>
    <li> We just got our smudge sticks or as our 4 year old likes to call them, bad dream smoke, yesterday.  They are wonderful and work well as bad dream preventors!</li>
    <li> I have to edit my previous review because what I just received is not even close to what I have received before. The odor of my new order doesn&#x27;t smell like your typical white sage, which has a sweeter sage smell (I still have some from my last order that smells great) but has a very rotten and ammonia smell to it. I&#x27;m pretty much just throwing these in the trash because I can&#x27;t have my house smelling that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve re-ordered this sage many times. It burns great, produces a lot of smoke and smells like white sage should. Anyone complaining about the strong smell, this is how white sage should smell. For a less odorous sage I would suggest a nice desert sage. If your needs are to produce maximum smoke for ceremony or ritualistic reasons I would recommend this white sage. Store in a cool,dry place because white sage will hold moisture and not burn as well. The quality of the sage is always great, they are packaged in bubble wrap and arrive intact.</li>
    <li> Burns easy and smells great! Once it&#x27;s lit, look out! It&#x27;ll keep cooking away until you snub it out. Much better than some of the hard to start sage I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
    <li> I use this product to cleanse my house. I like the size and the fact that I have two. You don&#x27;t have to worry when you are using one because you have another in the hole. That way when you burn the first one you can place an order that will be there before the second one burns out.</li>
    <li> These smudge sticks are much, much larger than they seem here.The sage smolders nicely and is a good quality product.Will be purchasing these again! They arrived nicely packed and in good time.</li>
    <li> This white sage burns beautifully, and lasts a very long time! The smells is amazing and lingers just a little. Great for smudge ceremonies! I am very satisfied with this product! :]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m part hippy(small part). So I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time in the woods gathering white sage. White sage is not always easy to find. So to buy such a generous amount for such a low price, is great. This is will last me over a year! Thanks!</li>
    <li> You not only get both of the sticks (which were thicker than I thought they&#x27;d be), but you also get a complementary mini sage stick.  I&#x27;ve used the mini one so far so I&#x27;m going to assume it will be similar to the larger ones.  Had a little bit of trouble with lighting it the first time, but once it&#x27;s lit, the smell is wonderful and there is QUITE a bit of smoke with the general lighting before it lessens some.  So, warning, don&#x27;t stand to close to it when you initially light it or you will get a face full of smoke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, lasts a long time (not even half way done with the mini stick and I&#x27;ve done quite a few rituals already as well as room cleansings), wonderful smell!  I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for white sage smudge sticks!</li>
    <li> nice size, great buy !</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the packaging. The smudge sticks were carefully wrapped in bubble wrap and then put into another bubble wrap envelope. They were in perfect condition and then there was a BONUS &#x27;thank you&#x27; smudge stick that was smaller. I would call it \\&quot;travel sized.\\&quot; I gave it to a friend so she could use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and would definitley recommend this seller. The price (for what you get) is unbeatable in my opinion!!</li>
    <li> Used these to cleanse my house and they smelt so good and burnt really well. Didn&#x27;t even use a whole stick to cleanse my 2600 sq ft home.</li>
    <li> All the sage I get here is very good quality and huge sticks not the little minis.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Nice large sticks.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the size of these sticks.  I know they will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I use it to purify the space.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell a lot !&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy the product again.</li>
    <li> smolders nice, excellent value.  i bought the 5\\&quot;/6\\&quot; ones too and they are much smaller for just a few dollars less.  i HIGHLY recommend these. great for purifying the mind and body, as well as the house.</li>
    <li> I really like ordering from Tom&#x27;s Incense. I get the highest quality products and the service is excellent. Highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Two Large bundles of Sage they well last quite awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bye, Bye those negative forces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells like someone smoked in my Apt. However.</li>
    <li> Huge sticks with a wonderful smell...</li>
    <li> it is a little to big for what i wanted but thats my falt  it burns good and keeps going on Good  job from toms incense</li>
    <li> Had no trouble at all keeping these lit. But best of all, they smoldered perfectly throughout the ritual. The whole house filled up this beautiful heavy scented white smoke (which is what I wanted)cause I didnt have to guess if I was getting all the areas in my house. Truly happy with this purchase!!</li>
    <li> I find these take a little while to start, but once they are started, the sticks burn slowly, provide the smudgy smoke I needed, and not a messy cleanup with the ashes being firm and ready to use for compost. I will buy these again if I need them.</li>
    <li> Didnt realize it would smell something like a camp fire, but i noticed ive been sleeping slightly better since i saged my room.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this product. It has a great scent. I just wish i didn&#x27;t have to keep lighting it up to keep it burning. It burns out within in five minutes.</li>
    <li> The smudge sticks arrived very fast.  The size was larger than I expected but I was delighted with that.  The fragrance and quality of the sticks was excellent.  I highly reccommend this seller. I would do business with them again</li>
    <li> Well packed. Large bundles.. dried and in great shape. burns good and smell is great. I felt great spritual energy with these</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used these yet--we moved shortly after I purchased them and they&#x27;re still buried in a box somewhere.... Although I haven&#x27;t used them, they smell very fresh and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be wonderful. The purchase price, speed and shipping were all excellent.</li>
    <li> these r great smelling good sized sticks that came very quickly. they last a while and burn quite nice. however. i forgotten i had already bought 6 from a native American Trading Post here so i used it anyway. still it was work it for two.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping ! Would buy again !</li>
    <li> ...the sage I got was dry and it burns fast. It is larger in size than most sage bundles, so it is a good price, value for money. It came on-time, with good packaging and had no excess marks on it. If you are sharp you can re-bundle it and make it a size for you, but it came put together well.  THX</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very familiar with White Sage smudging having used it for years and years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased these and stored them in the closet through the summer until I used up some white sage from a health food store that I was already using (I break it up to burn it - it lasts longer that way)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone says how this item here smells so good... which makes me think I must have had a bad batch or something. Kinda odd if true. I&#x27;ve never smelt white sage such as this, it&#x27;s awful. Smelt like cooking a chestnut that had gone bad. Gave everyone in the home horrible headaches. Will have to keep these for outside/yard cleansing only to use it up. Afraid I can&#x27;t recommend this myself. It&#x27;s a shame as the price is really great. :(</li>
    <li> First time using SAGE and I would order it again. I smudge my home with it as well as place in my burn pot. Sometimes hard to stay lit but its not a huge issue. Very nice size. I may try to grown my own.</li>
    <li> Great value. Two large white sage smudge sticks that last for several months. The value beats going to any metaphysical store, as they charge $5-8 a stick.</li>
    <li> This sage came to me literally fresh from the field...like it wasnt even dried yet.  WHen I opened the package I was in awe of the quality of the sage.  I could tell it had been very carefully handled for me and delivered to me right after harvest, which I very greatly appreciated.  I dried the sage for a couple of days and then used it, and it was definately the cleanest burning best smelling sage I have ever used.  ANd as a shaman I have used all kinds of different smudges from all over, but I am definately getting all of my sage from Toms Incense from now on, and you should too!</li>
    <li> I actually really like these wands.  I didn&#x27;t have to continuously keep relighting them, they burned well, smelled absolutely fantastic and completed the job without falling apart on me.  I will order these again.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t let the low price fool you, this stuff is great!  just like everyone has been saying on here, you get two extra large bundles of sage that will last you a LONG Time... enjoy!</li>
    <li> This was an excellent product. The quality and quantity is awesome. I love smudging my house with these sticks and also being able to share with friends. The price is right. I hope the deal and quality last!</li>
    <li> Seriously the best sage and a good amount for a good price. Highly recommend. The pictures were true to the product and not misleading.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT......WE ENERGETICALLY USE IT TO &amp;#34; CLEAN&amp;#34; OUR NEW HOME.....GREAT SMELL, GREAT FEELING WITH IT!!!!  PERFECTLY WRAPPED AND CONTAINED</li>
    <li> bought it for my mom that clears energy in her house with these...smells amazing and she loves it...now even sister wants it!!!haha</li>
    <li> These exceeded my expectations, very high quality, and a great price.They will last a long time, but when I need more, I will use this company.</li>
    <li> Probably should have read the whole 9&#x27;&#x27; thing before buying. I was under the (mistaken) impression that these were your standard smudge sticks of about 4-5 inches, not giant burrito-sized bundles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I&#x27;m even MORE impressed at the great price given the size, and I have no doubt this will end up lasting me much longer than I had originally thought. Happy accident. :)</li>
    <li> Nice huge bundles, burns evenly- a great product, thank you. Will purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost out. I sage ever time I feel bad energy. I have to keep lighting it. I come from a long ancestry of shaman. I have to have good energy near me at all times . I stress easy so I light this. Being empathic isn&#x27;t all that some times.</li>
    <li> These sage smudge sticks are a lot larger then they seem! Great amount for the price. They burn well and I will be buying again! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I ordered this sage Friday night and received Monday morning.I don&#x27;t know how this is possible but I am not complaining.The sage sticks are huge and smell so good. This was my first time smudging and I plan on doing it for the rest of my life. I am also going to buy for everyone I love. LOVE MY SAGE!</li>
    <li> Nice large bundles, smell great, can get multiple uses out of each stick. Good value for money. Will definitely buy again if needed.</li>
    <li> This is a wonder product, very calming scent. I am  so glad I tried it ! Everyone that comes to my house is checking it out..I&#x27;m sending your way Amazon.</li>
    <li> Got the sage very quickly. It&#x27;s nice and bushy, and they gave me an extra little gift. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Just bought more......White Sage Smudge Stick Two Pack, 9\\&quot;...works great super fast free shipping with a great price...burns great...and I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I received my sage much sooner than I anticipated.  I have used them several times and they were exactly looking for.  If you are looking for sage to smudge your home these are just the thing you need. Great Service and great product.</li>
    <li> They arrived promptly as described. They were packaged well so that they would not be damaged. I will order again if I need more.</li>
    <li> They arrived very quickly and a good affordableproduct which I find hard to find in Hawaii.</li>
    <li> Cant say much except this sage was easy to light, smokes the room really well. And leaves a rather pleasant aroma, unlike some other sticks i have encountered. I will buy more from this seller when we run out.</li>
    <li> Clearly I don&#x27;t get it because all this did was stink of smoke and fire and let off a lot of smoke. If I hadn&#x27;t have taken this outside it would have stank my whole house out of smoke which is clearly not ideal with twin babies in the house. It also would have most likely set our smoke detectors off. There was no pleasant herbal aroma, just smelt like I was burning wood/leaves. Very disappointed. Did my own energy cleanse with gorgeous smelling incense - it is after all the intention that matters...</li>
    <li> Larger than I expected......Beautiful, Exceptional quality, smells great, and I must say that these were more than I thought I was getting!!</li>
    <li> This was the first time ordering the sage from this site and all i can say is i was very please. It burn real smoth and it work real good.  I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased these twice now and both times the sticks I received were HUGE, fat, and smelled great.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re large enough to SLOWLY (and I do mean slowly, with lots of intention) cleanse a 1600-foot home at least ten times.&lt;br /&gt;The *only* problem is that they&#x27;re so fat it&#x27;s tricky to put them out when you&#x27;re finished. :)</li>
    <li> These particular smudge sticks have an oily coating to preserve them, and do not burn consistently. They require repeated lighting to keep them burning unless there is a breeze to keep the embers lit. It is best to take the protective plastic wrap off and let them dry for several weeks before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once lit, they emit a wonderful sage aroma, one that you will enjoy.</li>
    <li> I use to have trouble sleeping at night.  I&#x27;m a firm believer in the Spiritual Realm.  For years, I fet like some negative force or energy was trying to attack me in my sleep .  I didn&#x27;t know what to do, so I&#x27;d pray and read scriptures in the bible until I finally went to sleep.  I wanted to go higher in my spiritual relationship with the Creator, so I started seeking things that would draw me closer to him.  I can&#x27;t remember how I came upon the information about using SAGE.  I guess you can say the info found me.  To make a long story short, I&#x27;ve been using SAGE for about a month now.  And I can honestly say that I&#x27;ve had no problems sleeping.  Since I&#x27;ve been smudging, in the name of Jesus Christ, I&#x27;ve had NO problems sleeping!! WOW.  My goal was to find a more positive way to worship GOD, both in spirit and in truth.  But the negative forces were continually trying to block this.  But not lately!!  I&#x27;m so happy I found this product, and I will continue to use it faithfully!  This is very good and powerful stuff here.  Used in faith, mixed with God&#x27;s word... and you&#x27;ll surely see a difference. And the cost is close to nothing!!  Only the Creator himself could make such a product that is produced from the EARTH to bring such peace and tranquility.  Five STARS for the Creator.  And also for this company.  The product came on time and in very good and smelling condition!!  I&#x27;ll be ordering more from this company in the future.</li>
    <li> for 2 large sticks.  Nicely bound and slow burning.  Just want I wanted.  Will buy this again with no hesitation.</li>
    <li> Super great deal. Quality sage. Lasts a really long time. Bought multiples after the first time.</li>
    <li> Amazing! The sage is very fresh and is a great value. I frequently use sage throughout my home and these bundles will last a long time and smell great.</li>
    <li> These smudge sticks are excellent.  With my order I received the two 9&#x27; pieces + an additional smaller one as a nice surprise.  The sticks are HUGE &amp; I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to buy more for months if not longer.  I like to burn one small leaf daily &amp; then seasonally I&#x27;ll light the whole thing for a more thorough smudge.  For those complaining about it being hard to light - I haven&#x27;t had that problem.  It will burn out tho if you don&#x27;t keep it moving, but I think that is to be expected.  Overall, this is a great product at a great price.  5/5</li>
    <li> I was afraid when I ordered them that to make up for being 9&amp;#34; at such a good price that they&#x27;d be skinny. These are fat! I know I will get many hours of room cleary out of them. I&#x27;m so happy I got them.</li>
    <li> Wow! I know the description says 9\\&quot; long, but they just seem so much bigger! Great product. Smells wonderful. Packaged perfectly. Definitely buying more when I run out!</li>
    <li> Such a good product!! Burns very nicely. Very fresh product. Verry pleased. Also got a free sample in the pack, thought that was very nice.</li>
    <li> The quality and potency of these smudge sticks are outstanding. They are soft, fresh, and fragrant. Burn beautifully and make the house smell gorgeous. Will purchase again and again.</li>
    <li> What can I say I love the smudge sticks. I will deifinately, re-order them as needed and will recommend the to my friends. Thank you</li>
    <li> These smudge sticks are much, much larger than they seem here - the sage smolders nicely and is overall a good quality product. This is also one of the best buys for these I have seen. A store in my neighborhood sells larger ones individually for about 9.99, So naturally I chose this option instead. Will be purchasing these again! UNLESS you are looking for small, one or two-use smudgers, I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> This are great because they burn nicely and consistent. These I will buy again and I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Until I ordered this two-pack, I had always bought my smudge bundles from a metaphysical store. I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I bought these, but wow! They&#x27;re much larger than any I&#x27;ve purchased from a brick and mortar store and the price was unbelievable! I got both of these 9\\&quot; smudge sticks for less than I would have paid for one smaller stick somewhere else. I highly recommend this product and I will be ordering more of these in the future, so long as they&#x27;re available.</li>
    <li> I smudges my home &amp; myself. I liked it, the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the smell. To anyone that uses it, its really smoky so open all of your windows &amp; doors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Idk how often people should smudge their home but i wanna do it all the time now :)</li>
    <li> I bought these smudge sticks based on the glowing reviews here. The sage is so nice and such a good quality that they&#x27;ll last you a looong time. I&#x27;m only about 1/2 the way through one and I&#x27;ve smudged the house thoroughly 6 or 7 times. I&#x27;ll be buying from this seller again, every time.</li>
    <li> wonderful size and smell. worked very well, great value&lt;br /&gt;it did seem to take a day or two before it was shipped, but nothing out of line</li>
    <li> mostly a few leaves wrapped around a core of stems which doesn&#x27;t burn even after drying it out in full sun for a week. only the very outer layer burned which went fast after a few lightings.,</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my personal use.  I would recommend careful reading about smudging before trying on your own, however, these sticks were well made.</li>
    <li> I love using smudge sticks to clear my mind and heart and get into a more prayerful attitude.</li>
    <li> ...great and I will be using this to keep bugs away when I&#x27;m out and don&#x27;t want to be using bug spray.</li>
    <li> I smudge everything, especially when I feel negative vibes around me.......and that&#x27;s daily. Although sometimes I tell myself I should bring it down a notch my neighbors might think I&#x27;m smoking Mary Jane. Will be reordering from this company. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> This was my first time buying a smudge stick and this was a really great deal. Arrived quickly, nicely packaged and came with a little gift as well. One thing to be aware of is how much smoke is released. It has a very smokey smell, so make sure if you are doing this inside to open all your windows and turn on your fans and such. My hands and hair smelled like sage, which was expected. I did however enjoy the smell AFTER the smoke cleared. And I suffer from migraines and the smoke bothered a bit but afterward the house felt calm and my mood definitely improved.</li>
    <li> Living in the midwest, the only way I&#x27;ve ever seen sage bundles like these are in \\&quot;new-age\\&quot; stores that charge an arm and a leg for one stick half the size of these. Firstly, the sage sticks from Tom&#x27;s Incense arrived super fast. They appear to be approximately 9 inches long and at least 3 inches in diameter. I used one last night for my house prayer and the sage burns well and nicely fragrant. When I am finished using the sage smudge, I invert the stick in an incense burner filled with beach sand. This stops the sage burning and keeps it safe to use again and again.</li>
    <li> This smudge stick smells foul, nothing like the sage sticks I&#x27;ve used in the past.  It left my apartment smelling like there&#x27;d been a fire.  It also did not feel like it &amp;#34;cleared the air&amp;#34; like it was supposed to.  There&#x27;s better quality sage out there.</li>
    <li> The safe was wonderful everything was for trade perfectly and send to me exactly when said was done it was wonderful love the work excellent job sage people</li>
    <li> the smudging sticks at my local wiccan supply store are easily 1/3 of the size of these sticks for around the same price. The only con with this is they are not soft at all. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ve just spoiled by the small ones but normally sage has the texture of fur almost, very soft and fuzzy and this sticks do not have that. I haven&#x27;t tried burning them yet so we will see if that impacts the burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are worth the purchase, they are huge and the price is great.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for myself and for my stepdaughter and we haven&#x27;t used them yet, so I can&#x27;t speak for the actual quality yet.  But the product was very reasonably priced and it shipped quickly.  They feel quite dense as well.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  Will order again.  Makes my house smell strangely comforting. Its mystical.  Will keep some on hand always!</li>
    <li> I find this product to be very effective in cleansing and clearing the air in my home.  It burns very slowly but is very powerful, this product should last a long time.  I took me a couple of uses to adjust to the smell though it is quite strong, but once I got use to it I am no longer bothered by it.</li>
    <li> A great item and works perfectly. I have smudged my home and I feel so much more relaxed now. Thanks.</li>
    <li> These sage sticks are so much better and larger than pictured! They are as round as a silver dollar and 9\\&quot;. They also burn well like a cigar. Smudged the whole house only lighting twice from basement to second floor, used only about 1/2\\&quot; of stick. I had brought dead relatives furniture into the house and started having a few odd occurrences happen! I said oh no you don&#x27;t and smudged the house. Seemed to work well but my son and his friends now think I&#x27;m crazy. LOL Were all sleeping better now though.&lt;br /&gt;I now have enough left if anything happens again,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crazy in Sinking Spring</li>
    <li> I love these and great price.  I ordered three sets and holder they come in handy.  Sage when the feeling comes to me.</li>
    <li> Quite possibly the highest quality smudge stick I have ever used. I was impressed right out of the bag with the way it won&#x27;t crumble and fall apart before you even light it. Large leaves were used, and very neatly wrapped into a stick with extra care. Thick heavy smoke that won&#x27;t quit. I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I bought these to use as a safer mosquito repellent around the fire. We would get the end lit, and then walk around the yard to let it smoke a little. We do this every hour or so during a bbq and have no issues with mosquitos or other biting insects. They smell great and work well.&lt;br /&gt;If this review was helpful to you, please vote below!</li>
    <li> Great price great smell thanx alot I will br purchesing more as soon as I run ou!! Thanx again!! B</li>
    <li> have always used smaller sticks. thought i would try the larger ones, and they work well- but very active for small areas. mostly use outside around my property.</li>
    <li> These are big white sage sticks that are perfect for smudging. I like how it lasts a long time and the smell is just lovely.</li>
    <li> Nice size bundles but they are not nearly dry enough to burn I have had to try and dry them in the oven and microwave</li>
    <li> Great product....I had a reading and was reminded to &amp;#34; clean my house&amp;#34;&#x27; I have used it twice now. I smells nice and I will get many uses out of it. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product.  The smell is lovely and it is bundled just right.  It was exactly what I wanted.  The seller was prompt and I will order from them again!</li>
    <li> Love this, I use it all the time. This smudge stick does the job it stays on perfect, love the smell, Great quality for great price! Thank you.</li>
    <li> These white sage sticks were a bit bigger than I anticipated yet they worked beautifully.  I would continue getting them again but possibly the shorter ones.  These do work well shedding off some of the sage into a bowl to burn.</li>
    <li> These burn nice and evenly and are not hard to light.  Very fresh smelling.  I can&#x27;t prove they reduced negativity in my house, but I believe so</li>
    <li> This product does smoke alot -as I stated in my last review, but I do like the smell and I do love the product.</li>
    <li> I have bought a lot of sage through my years. This is the best quality and best value around. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> If you need some sage for a cleansing or whatever, this is the BEST place to buy it.  The item was well packaged and shipped fast.  The sage is held together by some easy to remove string.  Our household is lifted after using this sage.  Our monthly cleansing continues, we haven&#x27;t even used all the sage yet.  It lasts for a long time.  Thanks Tom&#x27;s Incense!</li>
    <li> Not sure what happened, last time the sage was excellent but this time it is not quite as good.</li>
    <li> The sage is great.  The sweetgrass braids are skimpy and old.  I had been hoping for fresh braids. better luck next time.</li>
    <li> Burns really well. Fantastic smudge. Just make sure you completely put it out when you  are done with it. It&#x27;s very thick and light easily. Lots of nice smell good smoke. It&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> i love these! really really love them! they are the best sage sticks i have ever used, great quality and last for a long time. would definitely buy again and again!</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the size and price for 2 usually this price is for 1 stick. The sent is nice and burns nicely. I have purchased twice. The free shipping is a plus!</li>
    <li> Wonderful smudge sticks and smell great, I cleanse my home every month or so, these sticks get the job done just right!</li>
    <li> It burns very well. I used to buy one of these from the local metaphysical shop for $10 and here is 2 for $7</li>
    <li> The sage is very good quality and it&#x27;s a great price.  It&#x27;s likely double the price if bought retail, and probably less quality.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t burn easily and the smell is not that strong. Too bad I ripped them apart or I would have returned.</li>
    <li> omg!!! they really ARE huge! i read the reviews before i bought these smudge sticks and thought maybe they needed to get out more often; but these smudge sticks really are big, fat, and long. this sage is fragrant and fine. i don&#x27;t understand why some people say they &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34;...i used to grow lots of it, and it smells just the way it should. i&#x27;m so happy with them and i won&#x27;t have to buy very often...which might be bad for the seller, but is great for me!</li>
    <li> These arrived in a timely manner and looked exactly as depicted in the image. Get them over a fire flame for a little bit and they will continue to smoke as long as you wish! Great smelling, soothing sage! Perfect for getting rid of negative vibes and bringing in positive ones!</li>
    <li> Amazing scent, great value for quantity!</li>
    <li> Smells nice gift for my mother uses it to cleanse the house of anything o she uses it all the time i will buy again</li>
    <li> Fun fact: I generally dislike the smell of sage. However, these don&#x27;t bother me at all. Of course it smells herbal and woodsy but it doesn&#x27;t smell like cheap/bad sage which can smell like Mary Jane -- and I absolutely detest that smell to the point where it gives me headaches and anxiety. Not these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think of how your kitchen smells when you cook fresh sausage and you can smell the sage. That&#x27;s what you get with these sticks, minus the smell of the actual sausage, obviously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It burns well, it smokes nicely, oh and did I mention they&#x27;re MASSIVE? I read the reviews and expected them to be quite large but they&#x27;re literally the size of my forearm, maybe an inch or two shorter. I&#x27;ll try to add a customer image later. If you need a lot of quality sage at an inexpensive price, get this! They usually are around ten bucks which is a steal considering most metaphysical shops charge you 7-8 bucks for one 5 inch bad-smelling bundle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are wrapped tightly enough so that they stay together (there was very little shedding in the package and what was lost was easily scooped into a bag for separate use), but not so tight they don&#x27;t want to burn. The only thing that&#x27;s odd to me is one is wrapped in white and the other in red string. It&#x27;s not a big deal though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was worried they might give me a headache since other reviewers claimed that happened and I had a pretty serious headache the night before these were delivered, but it hasn&#x27;t done that to me at all. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase and I will buy any and all sage I need from Tom&#x27;s Incense from now on (though I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll run out for quite a while!)</li>
    <li> absolutely wonderful, just the size it states it is, 9 inches and a nice fat size wideness too, works great and cleanses my house wonderfully. I couldn&#x27;t be happier and I plan to purchase more in the very Near future. Thank you and God BLESS. By the way, I received it so fast in the mail, my head spinned! xoxoxoooxoxxo</li>
    <li> I buy this religiously. I think it is great value for money and always fresh!</li>
    <li> Great product, I beleive in the power of sage to get rid of spirits and this works and does not make a mess.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something like this, but not this one. I only gave it 1 star because I can&#x27;t take the smell of this one. To me it smells so bad and gives me a really bad headache, but like I said it&#x27;s my own fault because I thought I was ordering the one I had before. This one is all sage. The ones I use is a mix.</li>
    <li> Sticks were good sized and cured well. Perfect aroma and burn. If you do ceremony or major smudging this is what you want. For simple smudging get the smaller ones. This size is getting difficult to find at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Excellent price for this great White Sage..Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Size is not too big and not too small. Nice smell. Turns on fast. Not sure how long it would last due to I light them for just 5 mins. each time. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> These were really nice, smell great and I believe that when burnt and spread around the house they add a wonderful aroma and of course chases all the negative spsirits away.</li>
    <li> This a first time I c smudge like this! They smelled weird and when I look inside the smudge I found dry warm! Not happy at all .... All of the three packs were like that so I just got rid of them! Didn&#x27;t have to run after a seller ......</li>
    <li> Bought these for camping and they&#x27;ll do the trick to keep the bugs and any negative vibes away!</li>
    <li> its so hard to find sage were i live , now i know i can bye it online won&#x27;t have to worry about it</li>
    <li> I love the sage from Tom&#x27;s incense. I use and buy a lot of sage and by far this is top quality. I would rather go on amazon to buy from this seller than outside at the metaphysics stores which I can get right away. When you burn a lot of sage you can tell the quality of the sage and smoke and this does not disappoint.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know what I was thinking but the next time I will purchase the smaller size ones, they will fir better into the dish and the smoke will be available a lot fater than with the large sticks</li>
    <li> Wonderful for practicing mindfulness ..</li>
    <li> What can I say about these high quality MASSIVE white sage sticks? Surprisingly, not at whole lot, and that&#x27;s a good thing! They burn well, smell great, and last for hours on the account that they are massive sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for high quality sage, look no further.</li>
    <li> Just what I hoped they would be</li>
    <li> What a great product, love the smell!</li>
    <li> Heard about cleansing your house of bad energy so I thought I would try it. I wasn&#x27;t sure about the smell it would leave. It wasn&#x27;t bad. It was more of a sage smell then smokey . Not sure if it got rid of bad energy but it didn&#x27;t hurt. My sister in law said she noticed a different in her house when she did it.</li>
    <li> I was and am very happy with my purchase and I am sure that I will do business with this seller again.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what I&#x27;d be getting with this order, however, I took a chance based on the positive review and the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I&#x27;m glad I took the chance. What I received was two large bundles of white sage tied with string (easily removed) with a roughly 2\\&quot; girth. Based on some of the negative reviews, I was worried that they wouldn&#x27;t smoulder very well, and I&#x27;m happy to say that so far, I&#x27;ve had no problems there. Lighting it the first time took a bit of effort, but after that, the bundle smouldered for over 15 minutes, and in one case, I actually had to wrap it to *stop* it from smouldering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it first arrived, it had the fragrance of another herb which I couldn&#x27;t place on it (probably from storage) and I was worried it had blended with the sage, but am glad to say it hadn&#x27;t. As soon as I lit it, the other fragrance dissipated and I was left with the familiar scent of white sage that I love so much.</li>
    <li> These sticks were huge and great. I was so used to the little small ones that when I saw this I was thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;It definitely works great and sends off a lot more smoke which I like.</li>
    <li> Amazing value, excellent quality</li>
    <li> Loved these smudge sticks, very fresh and fragrant.  I should have ordered the large feather as well I was looking at, it would have helped me distribute the strong volume of smoke more efficiently.</li>
    <li> These last a long time. I burn them to purify the air at home, especially when the house is closed up in the winter time. They were 20.00 at a local kiosk but much more reasonably priced on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It does burn out quickly but not so much that it&#x27;s a bother. I even break off a few leaves and just let them smoke.</li>
    <li> I knew what 9 inches was but looks much bigger up close. These will do great for smudging my new house.</li>
    <li> Great product for price - fast delivery.  Super packed bundles exactly as described.  Smelled great when I burned them - easy to use!  Great experience!  Thx</li>
    <li> Ok, so I love these. They are VERY large and probably over 9&#x27;&#x27;. Unfortunately, my roommate HATES the smell so I cannot use them as I would have liked. Great price for these, and they were wrapped and tied wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I bought this a while ago and I&#x27;m still on my first stick. Smells amazing and it is certainly wrapped up neatly.</li>
    <li> Sage has a very potent smell yet when used I can defiantly feel the difference in my home .Very happy with the product,Thanks.</li>
    <li> Good quality and price. Will use vendor for future sage purposes. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Once a month I smudge my house and before/after get togethers at my house. You definitely feel a difference on how light the house feels afterwards.</li>
    <li> I use Sage all the time!</li>
    <li> Yup - exactly what I was expecting.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> They were amazing. Fast shipping and they also throw in a extra one. Well diffentily buy from againg. They smell very nice when they are burned and they also dont fall apart as other smudge sticks do.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> These bundles are big and the sm. extra bundle (included with no charge) was a nice find! I will order again from this company.</li>
    <li> These are huge - 9&amp;#34;. I know the description said that but it just makes me happy to have ones this big.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve burnt maybe 100 sage sticks in my life. I always try to buy local for these type of supplies. However my local shop went under and I turned to Amazon. So glad I did! These are HUGE and very fragrant. VERY smokey. I don&#x27;t know what is special about THIS sage but it is VERY effective. Bad juju runs in abject horror</li>
    <li> This sage is high quality, a larger size, it burns slowly and smells wonderful. 100% satisfied. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> Nice smell&lt;br /&gt;Came in good wrapping or mailing condition&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again</li>
    <li> I have been burning sage for aeons and it doesn&#x27;t get any sweeter than this stuff.  Tight and wide bundles and not too dried-out.</li>
    <li> They work great clearing out negative energies and has a wonderful smell. I was amazed with the all of the smoke the smoke alarms never went off. I can&#x27;t thank you enough!</li>
    <li> 9\\&quot; wands: Delivered within estimated time, nothing was damaged, very generously proportioned, smells great, burns slowly... In a word: Perfect! Oh, and they included a thank you gift... PERFECT!!!</li>
    <li> This sage is great for smudging. It came very quickly and the sage came in nice generous bundles. and they&#x27;re HUGE. It also comes with an additional \\&quot;thank you\\&quot; little smudge stick! What a screaming deal! I will definitely come here in the future to buy more sage.</li>
    <li> Its an old Indian cleansing method to ward off evil spirits the Indians used along time ago and maybe still do use.  I use it to cleanse my home of bad spirits after a foolish mistake of playing with an Ouija board and then having strange stuff happen in my home seeing dark entities and things happening at 3:00am to my family. Yes evil spirits do exist people don&#x27;t be fooled...    The smudging does seem to help but blessed holy incense work better .</li>
    <li> I use this product as a native soul healer and a physical health suplument  Iwill be ordering more soon .</li>
    <li> I take them apart and burn only a couple of leaves at a time.  They are one of my favorite scents</li>
    <li> We like it, but I want skinnier sticks. These put off a lot of smoke for our tiny place. Hubby likes these thick ones though.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Great smell, burns slow.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Slow burning...my previous order of two lasted over a year with weekly smudging of a 3 BR townhouse.  Gets kinda &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; towards the end of the stick, but overall great sage.</li>
    <li> This sage is great. It is very high quality, I can tell when I burn it. It smells fresh and pure. They are very large and wrapped tight.</li>
    <li> I bought these for a cleansing ritual and they actually worked no nightmares or eerie feelings since I used them.</li>
    <li> The items arrived promptly and in good condition. I moved into a new house and used these items to cleanse the house. Each stick lasted a very long time &amp; was a pleasant fragrance. I would recommend this product &amp; seller.</li>
    <li> These stick were great and smelled good these willbe use more often buy me and my church and friends too</li>
    <li> Unless you&#x27;re smudging an entire hippie festival, this stuff will probably last you a while.  Good quality sage, in a generous bundle.  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good about this item and the good people behind this product. The Sage was shipped fast. It was of the highest quality and I was sent a free gift to top it off. I got a lot of white sage for the money. It was fresh and wrapped in bubble wrap to assure no damage in shipping. I have bookmarked the site and will continual to buy from then. Two thumbs up. :)</li>
    <li> When I recieved my product it was packaged very well! I could immediatley smell its freshness and recieved a lil bonus small sage that i wasent expecting. It burns great and I would definately buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> the smell reminds me of church.  suppose to bring luck and take away evil spirit or bad vibes.  still waiting!!</li>
    <li> I went to an American Indian Festival back in November.  I purchased some sage for the first time there.  I burned it in my oil burner with a 7-hour tealight candle.  My entire house smelled wonderful ... and I burned it when my dog pooped in the house and it took the bad odor right away.  I love to mix the sage with lemon oil ... what a wonderful fragrance.  The scent lasts a very long time.  I even burn this in my office at work.  Very soothing scent.</li>
    <li> The smudge sticks are large and lasts a long time. I am a repeat customer and most will likely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Firstly. These showed up at my house in just a few days after ordering. Thanks for the awesome shipping. When I opened the nix I was expecting to get 2 bags of sage each with 2 sticks. Well they were just loose in the box but not really a big deal. The first thing you notice is that these things are huge. They are at least the length they claim to be and something like 2-2.5 inches in diameter. They are nicely wound together with a bit of string. Felt very secure. Since they are so big they take a second to get going with a regular lighter but they are worth it. The smoke is excellent and they burn for quite some time. I actually put it out to use later. You can probably get 4-5 uses from each stick. Will definitely be getting more when I use them up.</li>
    <li> Good product. These are big sticks. I&#x27;m gonna need to cut them in half. So yeah I got a lot of sage now. Everything is good.</li>
    <li> Very high quality authentic white sage. Burns very smoky - this is a good thing! - with a strong clean sage odor. Recommended for space clearing.</li>
    <li> These things are huge!! Very crumbly but I take the extra that falls off and put it in an incense burner and light them up, the burn just the same!! Smells great, you can get a lot of uses out of these. Ive read people saying didn&#x27;t burn well, loosen the strings, loosen the bunch and they burn great!! Long lasting and what a deal!! I am ordering more as I am typing and the 2 I originally got will last a long time!! Stock up on these!</li>
    <li> Just as shown and arrived carefully wrapped. Thick with full leaves. I could tell these were gathered, dried and tied in bundles with care.</li>
    <li> You get a lot of sage for the price. Easy to burn. smells good. will last a while. item is exactly as pictured and described</li>
    <li> I wish I had paid attention to other reviewers about this product.  It smelled horrible and I threw it out.  waste of $$</li>
    <li> The reason why I give this 5 stars is because I had never used sage before but from what I bought it burnt well, the only thing is that it is so smokey that I had a hard time breathing after just using a quarter of it, the whole house looked like it was on fire and I did not like the smell, but for someone that uses sage i&#x27;m sure this is great stuff, but my husband will never let me use it again so in my drawer it sits till I decide to throw it away.</li>
    <li> These came in handy to cleanse my home from all the &amp;#34;bad energy.&amp;#34; They were easy to use, and packaged nicely so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about receiving a box with crumbs.</li>
    <li> Grandson had nightmares about a closet ghost and this really helped clear the air.</li>
    <li> The sage sticks were just as described.  Much larger than the mini size.  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to others.</li>
    <li> First off I felt silly buying sage in an area with sage growing wild. BUT I have witnessed that my county sprays pesticide, at night, all around my home and who knows where else. So I didn&#x27;t want to risk making a pesticide covered smudge stick. I decided to try this because it is highlyigh rated and I see why!&lt;br /&gt;The title states the size you don&#x27;t realize how big that is until it arrives. They are giant and smell divine! It was shipped with other items I ordered through Amazon and that wasn&#x27;t so great. But the smudge sticks themselves were nicely wrapped and arrived in great condition.</li>
    <li> WOW!  Great quality, huge size, can&#x27;t believe the good deal on this sage.  Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my sage smudge. It came in about three days and it was packaged very well. I ordered one for my in law and she too was pleased. It smoked very well and she saw an immediate change in her environment.</li>
    <li> Great product. I used one and it covered my entire house, which was great. Make sure to open windows to let your space air out well.</li>
    <li> These white sage smudge sticks arrived in *great* condition, exactly as described.  They are nice and thick so will definitely last an appropriate duration of time. The scent during smudging is soft and pleasant, works well for freshening and cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally for smudging the entire wand is lit, then blown out and the smoke is used for clearing out detrimental energies - have a smudge bowl available and read up before &amp;#34;trying this at home&amp;#34; or otherwise doing this for the first time to avoid burning down the building or causing harm to oneself or to the animal or creature or area being smudged.  The smoke emits negative ions, much as a waterfall or running water, to neutralize the positive ions.  I also have a small charcoal burner so I break off a few leaves to use as an incense on the charcoal.</li>
    <li> We were surprised at just how much came in the package. Got it on a whim to remove a lot of negative energy in the house. Make sure that you use it with windows open because it is powerful, and has a profound smell to it.</li>
    <li> these were great for the price</li>
    <li> This product smells awful, not what I have ever experienced with sage. A mildew smell, not worth the cost to send back. Will not buy from this seller again. On a plus note it came quickly and was well packed. I received a bonus stick, likely since no one wants this stuff!</li>
    <li> I keep ordering from Tom&#x27;s Incense as they send good quality smudge sticks without a lot of sticks, but leaves.</li>
    <li> GREAT Sage! I use it in smudging; blessing my home; in my baked birds (i.e., turkey, chicken, and duck); and as a medicinal hot tea for sore throat. I hope &amp;#34;Tom&amp;#34; can send me a link to my email.</li>
    <li> This came at a time when I really needed it! It came with two large bundles and a small bundle. I still have it, and I know it will last a long time. Fast shipping too! Again thank you!</li>
    <li> These are a total bargain! So much bigger than the one i bought (single) in my hometown. And it comes with two. All i can say is purchase these. Awesome.</li>
    <li> great smudgers! i love smudging my home with these. I just wish it was encased in better packaging. I had to throw them in a ziplock bag because the leaves started to crumple up and it just creates a mess. But i do love them!</li>
    <li> These are better than scent stick crap. They last long, burn long and they work well. Go for this one.</li>
    <li> as mentioned gave it to my daughter to bless her home and as a native american i am sure this is an excellent product thanks</li>
    <li> I have been buying this sage for a long time now.  It&#x27;s a great price and I like the aroma it has.  I usually buy four packs for me and now my sister in law is asking me to buy her too.  Great price</li>
    <li> I have to say I was rather disappointed in the smell of this sage. I LOVE white sage but this was lackluster at best. I&#x27;m not even sure I will be using this purchase at this point.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom for Christmas and she enjoys it lookin forward to buying more from this store</li>
    <li> This sage burns easily and creates a strong but nice smell that spreads all over the house (at least it did in ours).  We will likely get this again.</li>
    <li> I used one sage stick for a cleansing with a house prayer I found online...the results left the house and our family members with a good vibe...would definitely use again..</li>
    <li> Larger then I expected but nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a casual sage burner, mostly to clear energies of the day. This sage is the first I&#x27;ve purchased, but I&#x27;m very happy with it. Burns heady and strong, and the sticks are long.</li>
    <li> I usually go to the local spiritual shop to buy these.  For this size, they charge ten dollars per stick.  But I will say that these will still get the job done.  The leaves are not as tightly packed, I am not sure if it was the packaging or not though.  I will say that I prefer the quality of my spiritual shop more, but they severely over price it there and the quality is only about one step above.  There is a good discount here, and it is definitely worth waiting for to save twice the money.  If you are savvy with not wasting, use some charcoals and a burner to burn the fallen leaves to utilize the product fully.</li>
    <li> Love love love this sage!  It is so very perfect burns beautifully to do the job meant and bring all good things to my home - very happy with the product</li>
    <li> Great reviews. I agree. LOVE the aroma.</li>
    <li> It is great that Amazon offers these white sage smudge sticks to customers.  I am glad I purchased them.  These smudge sticks are a lot easier than drying the sage yourself and make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;st</li>
    <li> The sticks came smell very nice and do the job.  My only complaint is that they are bundled a bit more loosely than I like.</li>
    <li> Well wrapped and fresh. Burns nicely but not too fast due to bulk.</li>
    <li> I use this sage stick to smudge my crystals outdoor and the sage serves that purpose well. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this to smudge the inside of your house though as the smell is not very nice. I would buy a different smudge stick that has sage plus another nice smelling plant (like lavender) if you want to use it to smudge your house.</li>
    <li> I use my sage every day, price was great got alot and quite pleased. You just pull apart a branch at a time per use. Good quality. I recommend this sage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the product, they even send me a small sage package as a gift, the product is excellent, I just ordered more from them, the price is extremely affordable, in love with the product and the seller.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> we ordered the larger sage sticks so we could get more for our buck. And yes we did. these sticks are huge! It is exactly what we needed and they arrived very quickly. We have no negative comments to say about this sale. Thank you for a easy experience.</li>
    <li> I knew and expected this sage to smell alittle &amp;#34;suspicious&amp;#34; when I bought it, but wow, it made my whole house smell like I was doing something illegal. (If ya know what I mean.)  Too nervous to use it again.</li>
    <li> and I read up on it, so I opened windows, and went through every inch of my home. I had a feather earring I used to fan the smoke around and I had no problem whatsoever keeping the sage stick lit, it was really smoking!  I said the Lord&#x27;s prayer asked the Lord, St. Michael to bless and protect my home. When I was little, I used to hear my grandmother who was a ministers wife, say be careful who you let into your home people travel with spirits. Even though very few people come into my home, I still felt like it needed cleansing.  I must have done something right because it was peaceful and I slept so well I almost over slept for work this morning!  I really like this pack because they&#x27;re huge and they also give you a small one, so I started with that one!  I don&#x27;t think the scent is that bad.  But I did light an incense when I finished.  I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> The white sage smudge sticks were suggested to me to remove negative energy from my house and to use during my prayers and meditation and I really believe they have made a difference.....</li>
    <li> These sage sticks were packaged nicely and you get exactly what is pictured. Ive never used white sage before, but I recently became interested in \\&quot;smudging\\&quot; so I baught these. I think white sage smells like dirty armpit. It really has a nasty smell. But I baught these for spiritual reasons, not for incense. These smudge sticks go a long way. I just cut a small section off, put it in a bowl, and burn it, instead if actually lighting the whole stick. Just about an inch or 2 section was plenty for me to smudge my whole house. It smokes like crazy so I would recommend burning these on a windy day, so you can open the windows to suck all the smoke out.&lt;br /&gt;I liked these smudge sticks, I would order them again.</li>
    <li> Very nice and large smudge sticks but the smell is really off.  It smokes beautifully, but the smell lingers.  I really like the smell of sage, but these sticks do not smell like any sage I&#x27;ve used in the past.  The price was right though!</li>
    <li> This is the freshest, most fragrant white sage I&#x27;ve found online.  I will definitely be reordering when the time comes!</li>
    <li> This sage is exceptional.  I use it for cleansing and ceremonies and it is wonderful.  It is priced right and comes packed gently so as not to break up in shipping.</li>
    <li> This is the pure good stuff!!!! And u get 2 huge bundles! FYI: pure sage like this one does smell like marijuana! You have been warned!!</li>
    <li> These sticks burn very nicely; however, you may want to be careful when first lighting it because the flame can get fairly big.</li>
    <li> Was satisfied on what I purchased and the way it was packed. Not broken or chipped. Sage is tight and wrapped nicely.</li>
    <li> These smudge sticks are great quality, can burn for hours (smolder) and arrived super fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are doing a cleansing or clearing of energies I recommend you break part of the stick off, light it in a bowl (abalone shell for authenticity) and blow it out so it smolders because if you just walk with the stick embers fall off as you go around your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great quality product. Will buy again and recommend any day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy over 400 items a year from Amazon and always give an honest review in order to help those trying to make a purchase decision.&lt;br /&gt;This product rates 5 stars for use-ability, construction and price.</li>
    <li> Large size smudge sticks, they will last a long time, wrapped in bubble wrap and shipped very quickly, I was also pleased that they included a \\&quot;travel size\\&quot; smudge stick, very nice!  Nice to give to someone who would like to try sage! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Now I can finishing cleansing my home plus use it  to make my home smwlly better, sinse I have cats an a dog here.  I would buy rhis again.</li>
    <li> Never realized they were so big, even though the size was indicated! However they will become very handy in a larger place I am supposed to move in a few months, for a few months. Most likely I shall order more</li>
    <li> Bought this to clear all negative energy through smudging at the home I live. My shelter is not very big, just 2 rooms and I still have a bundle left to use. It smells very good and strong. I smudged several times since I purchased this and have great results still. I recommend this to anyone interested in smudging to clear negative energies within a space or human cleansing.</li>
    <li> The White Sage Smudging Sticks came sooner than expected and were much larger than expected as well.  I smudged the moment they came in and a little bit went a real long way.  I cut trimmings for smudging clients and the aroma to me was lovely.</li>
    <li> Smudges well, Smell is strong and effective for cleansing. Shipping was fast. Just be mindful when it gets down to the bottom, the sticks make a crackling sound when its burning/smudging. The pets might be a little freaked out by it, but it has not been a concern for me. I think I will stick with buying Sage from here as of this moment. Haven&#x27;t had any problems or concerns, no reason for me to look else where.</li>
    <li> The smudge sticks arrived in great shape and they are packed well so they will not fall apart.Many Thanks Blessed Be!</li>
    <li> These smudge sticks are simply wonderful!! They burn very nice and smell nice too. They are much larger than I thought they would be, a bonus for sure! I will definately purchase more from this company. The company delivered them super fast!!</li>
    <li> Grear size, about the length of a waterbottle. Smells nice! Wish they wrapped it in something better than newspaper, some of it was falling apart on one. And didn&#x27;t get my complimentary mini sage though. :( But besides that, seems like a good deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m feeling mixed. Like others said it doesn&#x27;t really smell, but it smokes a lot as soon as you light it. And when i took it out of the packaging it kept shedding like they had little pieces all tied together and held by a string that should have been a little tighter and more wrapped around it. I felt very unsteady using these especially for cleansing when i&#x27;m trying to focus on other things and because i said they have tiny pieces tied together some sparks fall much more easily than other sages. you have to be super careful and watch constantly.. I&#x27;ve used my fair share of sage but never felt super cautious in this way unless it was a short sage but still i feel much safer with those because it was more controlled. Although maybe next time i need to burn a hole in the middle to make sure it doesnt shed fire...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i dont think i would get this one again.. ill buy from someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price it&#x27;s okay.. but I&#x27;d rather feel safe and spend more for a better bound one.</li>
    <li> love this product and how long in lasts me because of the amount and size. Good amount for the price.</li>
    <li> Received these as described and they came in two nice large bundles. Gonna use them to scare away evil spirits............those spirits being Mosquitos. Wish I could scare away rude people with this. Can&#x27;t knock till you try ;)</li>
    <li> These are great, burn well, and are larger than they appear in the sellers photo.  I will buy these again.</li>
    <li> Item came quick, sage sticks are pretty good size was very happy!</li>
    <li> Use them often, great scent and cleansing for our home.</li>
    <li> The sage arrived very quickly....even before the estimated delivery time. The sage sticks were nicely packaged and were very large. They are easy to burn and smoke very well. I just did my first cleansing on a large house and only went through the tip of the stick. I recommend this!</li>
    <li> Good, basic white sage smudge stick. If you use white sage, like me, you will be satisfied.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Smudges work just as expected. Perfect sizes to not feel over whelmed. Would buy again if and when I need more</li>
    <li> Drives all the negative energy out of ones home......great item</li>
    <li> These are AWESOME!!! SO MUCH BIGGER than the picture shows! Excellent for cleansing out negative energy in your home (I speak from personal experience). You can&#x27;t beat the price! I have probably bought 5+ orders of these over the last 2 years. Excellent quality! Excellent Product!</li>
    <li> Was a gratefully accepted gift.</li>
    <li> Huge but did the job.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, I didn&#x27;t realize how large they were. Great for outside, but too large for inside which was my intention - the smoke is just too overwhelming even for medium sized rooms. Smells great, lit easily and lasted for quite a long while. Knowing these are too large for using inside I&#x27;ll have to find a smaller one, but I&#x27;ll keep these in mind for when I need to use them outside.</li>
    <li> 4 out of 5 Stars only because I received more STEMS than leaves. It&#x27;s still an awesome buy at an awesome price, so I will try it again. Maybe it was just a fluke before. We&#x27;ll see. Burns like what I pick up in Little 5 Points here in Atlanta. Good stuff. Once burned, the veil of smoke lingers for hours and sometimes even an entire day. The house smells &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; every time I sage it and my person. I even sage the garage and my vehicle. Niko G.</li>
    <li> If you need authentic and real sage that seems like it was just picked off the tree get this. If there&#x27;s any lower scores than 5 out of 5 stars ignore them!&lt;br /&gt;This cleared bad energy and it makes your house fresh with scent and good to use as you release positive energy as you walk around smudging all the bedroom and rooms!&lt;br /&gt;Your supposed to get the corners of the house which will take no more then ten minutes!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s relaxing and this product is straight up feng shui!&lt;br /&gt;(:</li>
    <li> A staple in my home. I burn sage weekly to rid my home of any negativie energy that may have been brought in from the outside. These sticks are large and last a long time. I purchase every 3-4 months.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the quality of Tom&#x27;s White Sage Smudge Sticks. They are thick, heavy sticks and wrapped perfectly so that they continue to burn as I am smudging my home. I have purchased sage from so many places. This is not only the best sage I&#x27;ve found but the best price as well. If you are a seasoned smudger I highly recommend this sage.</li>
    <li> These are so much bang for your buck. Huge bundles of what I consider quality sage.</li>
    <li> These 2 sticks, were nice - and nicely fragrant.  My only caveat is that they were very loosely bound thereby making it hard to burn lightly.</li>
    <li> These smudging sticks are a good size for the money. They smell really good and the turnaround time was fast.</li>
    <li> When it arrived it was very well put together and also a bit bigger than I thought it was going to be. It burned very evenly and lasted for quite awhile.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the order, it was&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping and arrived&lt;br /&gt;just in time. Thank you&lt;br /&gt;once again.. great product.</li>
    <li> Large bundles of dried sage. This will last me for awhile. Price is very good compared to buying it in local shop. When I run out I will be buying from here agin.</li>
    <li> Got lots of smoke but be careful. I  thought it was out and went outside and came back to a house full of smoke, which is the purpose I suppose.</li>
    <li> Nice size sage bundles.  We always use these when anyone moves into a new house.  They burned for a long time and did the trick.</li>
    <li> Should be a little thicker, I got larger sticks for the same price with another seller.</li>
    <li> Great smudge stick at a great price.  Burns evenly, great aroma, and long lasting.  What more could  a person want?</li>
    <li> These bundles are big! I love the smell and metaphysical properties of sage. Can&#x27;t go wrong with these for the price.</li>
    <li> These are HUGE smudge sticks....can last you a very long time. They smell wonderful and burn nicely. I really like them.</li>
    <li> I received the item as promised, and just absolutely love the smell of the sage.  Looking forward to using it around the house.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy for the price and size. I have been using this every day and I still have at least a couple more months of use. The scent is very clean. I love it.</li>
    <li> I got ripped off most of the leaves were dead I can&#x27;t really use this very unsatisfied the last time I order sage here it was great no problem at all but this batch I just got is unacceptable if I didn&#x27;t already tear it apart to examine it I would have returned it in a heart beat.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing cinnamon I have ever tried!</li>
    <li> I use it to clean my house and myself of any thing bad that wants to attach to my house or me.&lt;br /&gt;I will recomend it to my friends and will purchase more</li>
    <li> A lot of sage for the price. I bought this while I was waiting for my own to grow and dry out. Smells great and smokes abundantly.</li>
    <li> It came on time and in perfect condition!  I am so happy with this order I will be buying more when I need it</li>
    <li> If you enjoy a morning sage cleanse of your home as I do these smudge sticks are an ideal way of blessing your living space.</li>
    <li> you want to smudge it&#x27;s nearly twice the size. is the little one better who knows. this one is bigger.</li>
    <li> This sage arrived exactly as described. Wonderful smell, lovely quality. They even gave a teeny smudge stick for free! It arrived quickly and will last a long time. Super product!</li>
    <li> These smudge sticks are enormous!  I was able to walk the perimeter of a 1/2-acre property three times and let the sticks burn for an additional hour and they were barely burned even a third of the way through.  Being so thick, they stay lit easily and there is no need to re-light them over and over.  Plus, it makes a lot of smoke all at once.  If the thickness of smoke affects the thoroughness of the purification, I&#x27;m pretty sure that one of these sticks could exorcise the Devil out of his own body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the smoke is wonderful too.  Sometimes if we have an argument in our home, I like to burn just a leaf or two to clear the air.  It&#x27;s a relaxing, mind-clearing scent.  Even just the drawer in which I keep the smudge sticks smells absolutely heavenly upon opening it.</li>
    <li> These smudging sticks are enormous and a great value. They were perfect right out of the package, and burned very nicely. They are fragrant, perfectly dry, and burn easily. The smoke smells wonderful and is very cleansing. They are going to last for a very long time. For indoor use, I only light a small section of the wand because of my smoke detectors. However, if you were going to use it outdoors, lighting the entire end of the wand would produce an impressive amount of smoke. I couldn&#x27;t be happier! Thank you for a set of beautiful smudging sticks at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> They were delivered in good condition and fast. The sage, itself, was wrapped nice and tightly, and full. The price was great. Good buy, all the way around. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my mother so she could cleanse her house and I havnt yet given it to her. I have a couple people smell this product though and we all agree that it smells like marijuana and that was very unexpected!!! I think she will like the product unless it smells that way when it is burning too.</li>
    <li> The price is great for the 2 pieces of sage you get. You will be satisfied. Well worth it and Awesome packaging</li>
    <li> Law of attraction, you have to want to believe this works. I did mine everyday for 2 weeks now every so often I&#x27;m feeling down</li>
    <li> well i had some one cleanse my home. well i decided i would learn to do it my self since it works so well. the minute the sage arrived i felt more secure and i am so happy i bought it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found this sage. Great quality, wonderful scent and they are fresh. Also larger than expected. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend wanted this so we searched for them online. She wanted to go to a local store and buy them, but I found these. With the free shipping on Prime, these were cheaper (for 2) than she was paying for 1 locally. shipping was fast - took 2 days to get here. Will buy again when the time comes.</li>
    <li> If you believe in Feng Shui, then buy it</li>
    <li> I have purchased this twice now and each time the sage is a very good quality and I use it in my space often.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to everyone. Price. Product is just superb. HUGE bundles, well-wrapped (excluding delivery method, as they pretty well smushed my whole order)... well-wrapped individually. Was not their fault total packaging was amiss as far as protective materials, must&#x27;ve been new on tha job. Taking poor initial packing job into account, these fared one: perfect, second one: minor but annoying crumbling...  and  like I said, due to poor initial packaging from warehouse portion of the process.&lt;br /&gt;White Sage Smudge Stick Two Pack, 9&amp;#34; Tom&#x27;s Incense??? total satisfaction. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> What a surprise when I received this item! Talk about huge!! And it burns nicely. Great for cleansing the home!</li>
    <li> is ok...for me it kind of smells like marijuana...seriously. My husband even remarked the same when i smoked the house...</li>
</ol>
