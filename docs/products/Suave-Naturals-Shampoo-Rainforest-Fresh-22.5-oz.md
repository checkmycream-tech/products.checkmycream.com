      <li>This a good way to stock up on the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave</li>
      <li>the good news is that my hair doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell.  </li>
      <li>just because it makes me feel good and the scents are remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Shampoo;  good for the day to day</li>
      <li>/&gt;Otherwise, I would have to call it a darned good shampoo.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve been fighting oily hair, and Suave seems to do the best job at getting it clean, while being inexpensive.</li>
      <li>But if you like clean hair at a great price.........this is it!!</li>
      <li>Naturals Rainforest Fresh Shampoo does an excellent job of cleaning my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m enjoying using it!</li>
      <li>hey, for the price you can&#x27;t expect too much, and what you get for the price is excellent!</li>
      <li>The Rainforest fragrance is a nice scent, btw.</li>
      <li>already knew this shampoo was going to be good, as I love Suave shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I liked the smell and would buy this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I liked the addition of aloe as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells nice both in the bottle and on my hair</li>
      <li>It does have a nice \\&quot;manufactured nature\\&quot; smell of the kind associated with Yankee Candles</li>
      <li>Another nice point is the price.</li>
      <li>That just sounds nice, doesn&#x27;t it?  </li>
      <li>They also have a light scent and pleasant.</li>
      <li>If you  are looking for something that will not leave a overwhelming scent, this is nice.</li>
      <li>Suave has always been a pretty good product, and a good value for the price.</li>
      <li>Our family liked the mild but noticeable foresty smell, it lathers well, cleans well, and is everything you expect from a good shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Though, for not being a special smoothing shampoo this does leave my hair fairly managable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo and the matching conditioner [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Bathe rainforest fresh smell is nice!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not flowery or particularly fresh smelling, but a pleasant odor nonetheless.</li>
      <li>the shampoo is strong but nice smelling when you put it in your hand.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo worked well for me - went into hair smoothly and leathered up nicely.  </li>
      <li>If you like paying more for shampoo, be my guest.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>It does not smell refreshing at all.  </li>
      <li>I love the prices just not the sodium laryel or ith sulfate that I can&#x27;t even remember how to spell.</li>
      <li>I love exotic things, and I love the idea of rainforests!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>which is my favorite shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>shampoo works okay for my hair</li>
      <li>, though, I wouldn&#x27;t use it all the time as, I need more of a smoothing shampoo.</li>
      <li>My favorite is Tea Tree oil because I like the scalp tingling in the morning.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is no exception, and those who like and trust the Naturals line will be pleased.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is an outstanding value for the price.  </li>
      <li>, I love the scent of this matching conditioner and shampoo.</li>
      <li>I also don&#x27;t love the conditioner.</li>
      <li>The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming like some inexpensive shampoos.</li>
      <li>I have used Suave shampoo for many years.  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve been Suave customers for many years now.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
      <li>/&gt;We wish it had a pump top.</li>
      <li>love the Suave line of hair care products for her since they are so affordable.</li>
      <li>We buy Suave shampoos quite often - mostly because its inexpensive and seems to get the job done.</li>
      <li>it did have more body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also in the summertime when she&#x27;s swims at the pool most days, she also gets an additional shower to wash the chlorine off.</li>
      <li>I use Suave shampoo most of the time because I find it cleans my hair without leaving the residue that 2-in-1 products tend to.  </li>
      <li>the problem with many inexpensive shampoos).  </li>
      <li>They have just a nice, clean scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
      <li>My hair came out nice and clean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I would repurchase this if my favorite wasn&#x27;t available, it&#x27;s a great all-around product at an inexpensive price.</li>
      <li>Suave Naturals Rainforest Fresh Shampoo is perfect for me; the huge 22.5 ounce bottle is very inexpensive, it makes my hair feel clean, and as an added bonus I don&#x27;t smell like a girl when I&#x27;m done.</li>
      <li>They like most of the available fragrances, and none of them seem overly strong to us.</li>
      <li>(Am I the only one that alternates \\&quot;meh\\&quot; shampoos with great ones?) :)</li>
      <li>shampoo lathers well &amp; easily rinses out.  </li>
      <li>I particularly love the Rainforest Fresh Scent and am enjoying using it on my hair for a \\&quot;pick</li>
      <li>This particular shampoo is not for that --- however, it is really good.  </li>
      <li>many scents-- strawberry, coconut, rosemary mint, mango mandarin, apple, sweet pea, and others</li>
      <li>I like a shampoo that gets my hair clean in one or two rinses, works well with my conditioner (Lush Veganese) and smells great.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is just fine with me.  </li>
      <li>Soaps up fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a perfectly fine shampoo, but it&#x27;s not one I would use all the time.</li>
      <li>It is a clean, fresh scent that is not over-powering, and is suitable for everyone.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge proponent of the Naturals.</li>
      <li>The shampoo really cleans the hair nicely without leaving you feeling like it&#x27;s got a bit of a greasy feel afterward.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything with this free \\&quot;Rainforest\\&quot; scent that wouldn&#x27;t make its home on your bathroom</li>
      <li>Even without conditioner, our hair looks shiny and smooth after using this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I suppose it is just a cheap way to add to the exoticism.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The rainforest shampoo (&amp; conditioner) fragrance is a light fragrance &amp; doesn&#x27;t stick with you throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Definitely a great, inexpensive choice for daily hair care.</li>
      <li>Kudos to Suave for the light fragrance.</li>
      <li>Suave is a great company and this is a shampoo that you&#x27;ll definitely want to try.</li>
      <li>Cheap shampoo for a cheap price.  </li>
      <li>Suave \\&quot;Naturals\\&quot; line is hypoallergenic which is important if you have any sensitivities.</li>
      <li>In fact, I can often get it for free by combining sales and coupons.  </li>
      <li>But there is more, they are simply basic, good quality products.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is an okay shampoo if you have the right hair type.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have always like Suave shampoo. This smells very nice and the price is great. If you like paying more for shampoo, be my guest. But if you like clean hair at a great price.........this is it!!</li>
    <li> Cheap shampoo for a cheap price.  Does the job for a buck and a half.  Guess I shouldn&#x27;t complain as it is exactly what I knew it to be.</li>
    <li> I love the prices just not the sodium laryel or ith sulfate that I can&#x27;t even remember how to spell. An all the other unnecessary chemicals I saw one that was lower in sulfates but that was the best they could do??I think not. Johnson an Johnson has a baby shampoo that is 98 percent plant derived an 4 bucks. What can you do Suave???</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge proponent of the Naturals. This is the one exception. It doesn&#x27;t seem to clean as well. For that reason, this might be a nice, soft body wash but it won&#x27;t get all the goop out like the clarifying or strawberry. Other than that, the fragrance is pretty and it can be a hand soap, face wash, or even shaver, based on the mildness. I also don&#x27;t love the conditioner. It feels waxy, unlike the fruity ones like apple and strawberry.</li>
    <li> Shampoo;  good for the day to day ya cant beat the price i would definitely recommend it to anyone trust me.</li>
    <li> The shampoo works great but the smell is a little overpowering in the shower.  the good news is that my hair doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell.  Overall I would purchase again</li>
    <li> The shampoo has a metallic smell that disguises the rainforest essence that I anticipated at purchase. Soaps up fine. The scent is off-putting, though.</li>
    <li> This is truly hypoallergenic, gluten-free and mildly conditioning.  I like to use it during the allergy-ish seasons of the year. It&#x27;s good for washing Mountain Cedar out of your hair, without overdrying, tangling, or frizzing longer, naturally-curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From an aesthetic standpoint, this shampoo is a good choice as well.  The overall feel of the shampoo is pleasant; it&#x27;s a firm gel, and it&#x27;s not slimy, unlike many other shampoos. The scent is mild, and pleasant; if you or your significant other aren&#x27;t much into scents, this is a good choice, because it doesn&#x27;t have a lasting scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an outstanding value for the price.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair.  I like a shampoo that gets my hair clean in one or two rinses, works well with my conditioner (Lush Veganese) and smells great.  This shampoo works great but the smell is off-putting.  It does not smell refreshing at all.  It&#x27;s a little fruity, which is not what I think of when I think Rainforest.  Fortunately the scent does not last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I would have to call it a darned good shampoo.  It lathers just the right amount (I don&#x27;t like too much lather that is hard to rinse out).  My hair is soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband also tried it and felt it was just average.  I have to say, though, that his hair looked really fluffy after shampooing - it did have more body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I won&#x27;t be buying more because the scent is a deal breaker,  If you are less particular and just want a good shampoo, it could be a 5-star product for you.</li>
    <li> My wife, son, and I all thought that the scent is very pleasant. We also feel it leaves hair feeling very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We wish it had a pump top.</li>
    <li> I have been using Suave products for decades.  I love the choices and the shampoos overall.  I was intrigued by this new rainforest shampoo.  I just and to try it.  The only things I noticed is if you are hgihly sensitive to strong smells the shampoo is strong but nice smelling when you put it in your hand.  I liked the smell and would buy this shampoo.  I wonder what Suave will come out with next?</li>
    <li> This shampoo is just fine with me.  I have wash and wear hair and use this with its companion conditioner.  The scent is light and there is a good clean feel without being heavy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had great success with Suave products and I wasn&#x27;t too surprised to find that this Rainforest shampoo was no different. The shampoo smells great and it leaves my hair feeling very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost always condition after using shampoo, but I like to use a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair matted after if I don&#x27;t use it. With this shampoo, that isn&#x27;t a problem at all. I liked the addition of aloe as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is a great value for the money. Suave is a great company and this is a shampoo that you&#x27;ll definitely want to try.</li>
    <li> For reference, I have baby fine, long, naturally wavy hair with highlights and lowlights. My hair tends to get frizzy and dry-looking on the ends and I usually have to use a frizz-reducing shampoo [[ASIN:B005SPETGS Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Smoothing Shampoo, 12.6 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] which is my favorite shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo works okay for my hair, though, I wouldn&#x27;t use it all the time as, I need more of a smoothing shampoo. This is more for normal hair or someone who doesn&#x27;t need a special product for smoothing or body. Though, for not being a special smoothing shampoo this does leave my hair fairly managable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo and the matching conditioner [[ASIN:B00A0IWT9C Suave Suave Naturals Rainforest Fresh Conditioner, 22.5 Ounce]]is a great choice for those on a budget or for large families as this is a large bottle which would last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I love the scent of this matching conditioner and shampoo. They have just a nice, clean scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming. I even use this shampoo as a shower gel or to shave my legs- I like the scent that much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would repurchase this if my favorite wasn&#x27;t available, it&#x27;s a great all-around product at an inexpensive price.</li>
    <li> Suave Naturals Rainforest Fresh Shampoo is infused with aloe and bamboo extract.  It is hypoallergenic and has a long-lasting fragrance.  To use it massage through wet hair and rinse well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the Suave Naturals Rainforest Fresh Shampoo.  It is easy to use and pour - it is designed so you cannot pour out too much shampoo at one time so you don&#x27;t waste any.  The shampoo has a nice pleasing odor - it really does smell rainforest fresh.  It smells nice both in the bottle and on my hair - this makes it a pleasure to wash my hair.  At 22.5 ounces this is a nice large bottle that will last me a long time.  Another nice point is the price. it is very inexpensive and part of Amazon&#x27;s add-on program - add this to an order over $25 and you are eligible for free shipping. This a good way to stock up on the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave Naturals Rainforest Fresh Shampoo does an excellent job of cleaning my hair.</li>
    <li> Suave is dominating its niche - IMHO, its shampoos and conditioners are as good as the next price level up, but very affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave&#x27;s Rainforest Fresh shampoo is no exception.  Our family liked the mild but noticeable foresty smell, it lathers well, cleans well, and is everything you expect from a good shampoo.  My wife prefers Suave&#x27;s [[ASIN:B00A0IWRT4 Moroccan Infusion Shine Shampoo]] for extra shine and manageability, but the kids and I like this just fine, and recommend you give it a try.</li>
    <li> I basically look for two things in a shampoo: 1. Inexpensive and 2. Clean my hair. Suave Naturals Rainforest Fresh Shampoo is perfect for me; the huge 22.5 ounce bottle is very inexpensive, it makes my hair feel clean, and as an added bonus I don&#x27;t smell like a girl when I&#x27;m done. The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming like some inexpensive shampoos. Also I&#x27;m able to use a very small portion to clean my hair; I think a bottle like this will probably last my 4 months or so at the rate I&#x27;m going.</li>
    <li> This is a thick gel that lathers up nicely. It has a mild fragrance - which I like since I don&#x27;t like my beauty items full of perfumes. My hair came out nice and clean. Well -- what else can you say about a shampoo. So that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> My pre-teen daughter has very oily hair at this age (12). She has to wash her hair every day, since after just a day at school, she comes home with very greasy hair. She can leave for school at 7:30am with her hair soft and fluffy, and by the time she gets home her hair looks like she ran a marathon. So she washes it every morning before school. Also in the summertime when she&#x27;s swims at the pool most days, she also gets an additional shower to wash the chlorine off. She doesn&#x27;t color her hair, it&#x27;s not permed, she doesn&#x27;t style it and it doesn&#x27;t have any special needs. So she doesn&#x27;t need anything that helps retain color, thickening, adds body, adds shine, helps curls or anything else. Just plane shampoo and conditioner to wash out sweat, oils or chlorine from the pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Suave line of hair care products for her since they are so affordable. They clean and condition kids hair well, have good fragrances kids tend to like and are some of the least expensive hair products on the market. When your kids graduate from the tears-free versions of shampoo, but you&#x27;re not looking to buy them hair products at $8/bottle, Suave is the way to go.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t always use Suave, but when I do I can&#x27;t help but gravitate towards the Naturals line... just because it makes me feel good and the scents are remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is no exception, and those who like and trust the Naturals line will be pleased.  It&#x27;s good Suave efficacy on hair with a wonderful scent that does indeed invoke the tropics.  This is a shampoo where a little goes a long way and for the price this is a steal of a bargain.</li>
    <li> I shampoo my hair everyday even though it tends to be dry because of home coloring and other products I use. This mild shampoo is affordable and works well to just clean and freshen my hair. I love products with fragrance and really like the smell of this with its aloe and bamboo extracts. I pair it with the [[ASIN:B00A0IWT9C Suave Suave Naturals Rainforest Fresh Conditioner, 22.5 Ounce]] and my hair is not frizzy or overly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Suave \\&quot;Naturals\\&quot; line is hypoallergenic which is important if you have any sensitivities. Definitely a great, inexpensive choice for daily hair care.</li>
    <li> I have used Suave shampoo for many years.  I can&#x27;t remember exactly when I bought my first bottle, but our household became a regular user about the time that Johnson&#x27;s Baby Shampoo stopped being effective on our kids&#x27; grimy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now over time, I&#x27;ve gone through many scents-- strawberry, coconut, rosemary mint, mango mandarin, apple, sweet pea, and others I can&#x27;t recall at the moment-- and this is the first product I can remember not liking the fragrance.  To me it doesn&#x27;t smell like a Rainforest, or anything else.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it is stinky, just not appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as suds, it doesn&#x27;t work well for everyone in my family.  I tried it and thought it was not quite mild enough for colored/processed or long hair.  In fact, I told my daughter (the one with the short red-dyed hair) not to use it.  My husband also didn&#x27;t like it.  He has thick hair that tends to be oily, and he decided it wasn&#x27;t getting his hair clean enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, my 10-year old son thought it was great.  He&#x27;s been using it as a shampoo and body wash and I must admit that he&#x27;s thoroughly clean.  The shampoo leaves his Tween hair shiny and bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an okay shampoo if you have the right hair type.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for hair that needs mild treatment.  Or for hair that tends towards oiliness.  And finally, if you are going to buy a Suave shampoo is this price range, try another fragrance.</li>
    <li> I usually use Suave shampoo, and this Rainforest Fresh is comparable to other Suave shampoos I have used in this price range. This particular scent is very strong--stronger than I prefer, but others may enjoy the strong, flowery scent. In any case, it doesn&#x27;t linger too long, if you don&#x27;t care for it. My one caution would be that if you are ordering this from Amazon, check out the shipping costs of the supplier. At least one supplier is charging $17.00 shipping at this point which is absolutely ludicrous! So check out the shipping costs and make sure you are not getting \\&quot;taken\\&quot; on an otherwise decent bottle of shampoo!</li>
    <li> We buy Suave shampoos quite often - mostly because its inexpensive and seems to get the job done. I like some scents better than others, and this one isn&#x27;t my favorite, but I like it well enough. I&#x27;m not sure what the rainforest smells like, and I&#x27;m pretty sure it doesn&#x27;t smell like this, but it&#x27;s not bad at all. I have longish hair and tend to use products for manageability (I&#x27;m not sure it ends up looking manageable, but free and wild is what I&#x27;m going for). The most important thing for me is that after I&#x27;ve washed my hair I like it to feel completely free and clear of the residue of gel and other products I&#x27;ve used. This shampoo seems to do the trick. The conditioner, which I&#x27;ve also used, adds a bit of softness and depth, that I like as well.</li>
    <li> When it comes to Suave&#x27;s regular products(non-specialty), they are just \\&quot;okay\\&quot; for me. That&#x27;s the case with this shampoo. It&#x27;s a perfectly fine shampoo, but it&#x27;s not one I would use all the time. I&#x27;m a coupon girl, so I would by no means pass up a great deal on this product, but it would be the shampoo that I would use a really great shampoo after I used it up. (Am I the only one that alternates \\&quot;meh\\&quot; shampoos with great ones?) :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, though! It just doesn&#x27;t do great things for my hair. My momma has used the regular Suave shampoos in the past, and thinks they make her hair fall out more than with some other name brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a fine shampoo, but not awesome.</li>
    <li> Suave Naturals Rainforest Fresh Shampoo.  I am shampoo person.  Although I&#x27;m not as bad about it as I used to be, but I love washing my hair.  Now that I&#x27;ve gotten older, I usually use those shampoos that are especially for color-treated hair.  This particular shampoo is not for that --- however, it is really good.  Oh, I don&#x27;t always use shampoo that is for color-treated hair.  I still use shampoo for regular hair sometimes, too.  I am currently using this particular shampoo and I love it.  I have always been a big Suave shampoo user, so I know it is a well-trusted company with quality products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already knew this shampoo was going to be good, as I love Suave shampoo.  But when I saw \\&quot;rainforest\\&quot; on it, that is what made me really want it.  I love scents, and \\&quot;rainforest\\&quot; is something that just sounds so wonderful and awesome.  I love exotic things, and I love the idea of rainforests!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This shampoo worked well for me - went into hair smoothly and leathered up nicely.  Hair felt clean and ready for conditioning afterwards.  The scent is always a deal breaker for me.  This has a light &#x27;green growing&#x27; non-flowery smell that doesn&#x27;t linger but is pleasant when using.  In all, I think this is a great purchase at a great price.</li>
    <li> The biggest selling point of this \\&quot;Suave Naturals Rainforest Fresh Shampoo\\&quot; is the size--if you are on a budget this is a fantastic shampoo to wash a houseful of heads with. It&#x27;s the kind of deal I would have been thrilled with back in my college days and am still pretty excited about now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m not super picky on my shampoo. My favorite is Tea Tree oil because I like the scalp tingling in the morning.  I can be a total sucker for marketing and things like \\&quot;Rainforest Fresh\\&quot; lure me in.  That just sounds nice, doesn&#x27;t it?  According to the bottle, it&#x27;s infused with aloe and bamboo, which aren&#x27;t exactly \\&quot;rain forest\\&quot; plants but that&#x27;s OK. (I&#x27;m not sure what exactly bamboo is supposed to do for your hair anyways.  I love bamboo, but it isn&#x27;t exactly known for its cleaning properties ... I suppose it is just a cheap way to add to the exoticism.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the \\&quot;rainforest fresh\\&quot; is hard to pin down. It certainly doesn&#x27;t smell like a rainforest. I&#x27;ve been in rainforests AND bamboo forests and neither of them smell like this.  It does have a nice \\&quot;manufactured nature\\&quot; smell of the kind associated with Yankee Candles so if you like that sort of thing you will be happy with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But hey, for the price you can&#x27;t expect too much, and what you get for the price is excellent!</li>
    <li> I tried this and it left my hair feeling soft.  I used it with the corresponding conditioner [[ASIN:B00A0IWT9C Suave Suave Naturals Rainforest Fresh Conditioner, 22.5 Ounce]]. They work really well together. They also have a light scent and pleasant. If you  are looking for something that will not leave a overwhelming scent, this is nice. It is everything I have come to expect from Suave.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing special about Suave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a simple shampoo that get&#x27;s the job done.  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything with this free \\&quot;Rainforest\\&quot; scent that wouldn&#x27;t make its home on your bathroom shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistently simple, yet effective.  The Rainforest fragrance is a nice scent, btw.</li>
    <li> We buy Suave shampoo a lot at our house because it is inexpensive and works well.  Although it&#x27;s not very thick, it doesn&#x27;t feel too watered down (the problem with many inexpensive shampoos).  My hair always feels clean afterwards.  Suave Rainforest Fresh works just as well as the other Suave shampoos I&#x27;ve used; and it has a wonderful scent, different from the Suave fruit scents but just as good.  This one reminds me of fresh cut leaves.  I feel like I&#x27;m outdoors swimming in a whole pool of them.  I like it and will be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> Before I received this shampoo &amp; conditioner to review, I already had some suave shampoo &amp; conditioner in my shower.  It&#x27;s a great basic shampoo, nothing fancy, it&#x27;s affordable, lasts my husband and myself a long time. Bathe rainforest fresh smell is nice!  I&#x27;m enjoying using it!</li>
    <li> I often pick up Suave Products because of the price in the supermarket. But there is more, they are simply basic, good quality products. This particular shampoo is no exception. I particularly love the Rainforest Fresh Scent and am enjoying using it on my hair for a \\&quot;pick me up\\&quot; in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Years ago, Suave advertised that its line-up of shampoo/conditioners were \\&quot;salon quality\\&quot; at a budget price.  They were right on.  With the exception of their clarifying line, the regular Suave shampoos/conditioners have been my choice for years - and I regularly received compliments on my soft &amp; shiny hair.  The Rainforest Fresh combo is no different - it leaves my hair soft &amp; shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo lathers well &amp; easily rinses out.  The conditioner is thick &amp; is easy to massage into your scalp. It also rinses out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rainforest shampoo (&amp; conditioner) fragrance is a light fragrance &amp; doesn&#x27;t stick with you throughout the day. It is a pleasant, forgettable (in a good way) fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Rainforest Fresh scent is a nice addition to the regular Suave line-up. Kudos to Suave for the light fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have used this a few times now and have to say that Suave has come a long ways over the years.  I really like the scent as it&#x27;s light and not overpowering like some.  The shampoo really cleans the hair nicely without leaving you feeling like it&#x27;s got a bit of a greasy feel afterward.  I always shampoo twice and not always have luck with my hair not drying out quickly.  This hasn&#x27;t done that.  My hair feels wonderfully clean, fluffy and light so that&#x27;s what counts in my book.  Will have to try some of the other scents now.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been Suave customers for many years now. The price is always right, and the results are exactly what we hope for. I have 3 daughters so we go through A LOT of shampoo. They&#x27;ve been fighting oily hair, and Suave seems to do the best job at getting it clean, while being inexpensive. They like most of the available fragrances, and none of them seem overly strong to us. We&#x27;re all pretty \\&quot;scent-sensitive\\&quot; in our family, so we have to be careful of items that have a strong fragrance. Suave shampoo gets their hair clean but the scent doesn&#x27;t linger and give us headaches. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I love the subtle smell of this shampoo.  This is the aloe and bamboo version. We usually buy natural aloe vera and we are glad to find it in this shampoo. Even without conditioner, our hair looks shiny and smooth after using this shampoo. Suave are also usually very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> it s not bad but it doesnt have any smell</li>
    <li> We use lots of Suave products here.  They all have seemed to work well, and normally you can&#x27;t beat the price.  In fact, I can often get it for free by combining sales and coupons.  This shampoo cleans well, and you don&#x27;t need much of it to lather and clean well.  Every scent we have used has been pleasant, but never overwhelming.  If you don&#x27;t have any particular scalp or hair issues, this is the product to use.  Why spend more than you need to on personal care?  Try the shampoos, conditioners, body washes, deodorants, body lotions and soap products.  They never disappoint.</li>
    <li> I have to admit seeing \\&quot;Suave\\&quot; made me suspect this shampoo wouldn&#x27;t be great. After all, I am a shampoo snob about my long hair... I generally only use the nicer ones you can find at your typical \\&quot;big store\\&quot; and I also use some of the Bumble &amp; Bumbles on special occasions.  But I was VERY PLEASANTLY surprised when it actually did a great job on my long, blond and straight hair. It moisturized it while also cleaning it and it came out shiny and beautiful!  Which says a lot because I have been looking among the more expensive brands for one that would do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair type is semi-thick and mostly straight, it can get dried out and frizzy with poor shampoos/conditioners but at the same time it gets very greasy quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So a definite 5 stars for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I am also ultra allergic to soaps... the higher end shampoos don&#x27;t bother me but this one did.  I&#x27;ve been breaking out in hives every time I took a shower since I was a teen... and only through careful bodywash and whatnot have I controlled it.  So it was disappointing to change nothing but my shampoo and notice right away that I was breaking out in hives again, especially along my back where my hair was laying.  So if you are like me and are VERY sensitive, then I would avoid this one. If you are not, then GO FOR IT!!! It&#x27;s a great price and it does a great job!</li>
    <li> Suave has always been a pretty good product, and a good value for the price. Suave shampoo cleans very well, lathers up quickly and rinses completely without leaving residue in your hair. This Rainforest Fresh version is no different in performance, but offers another scent to choose from. It is a clean, fresh scent that is not over-powering, and is suitable for everyone. Of the various scents Suave offers, this isn&#x27;t my favorite, but if lavender or strawberry were not available I would certainly buy this again. It&#x27;s a matter of personal preference.</li>
    <li> I use Suave shampoo most of the time because I find it cleans my hair without leaving the residue that 2-in-1 products tend to.  It&#x27;s really inexpensive, but worth every nickel.  One of these large bottles lasts me the better part of a season, even with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell does not really evoke \\&quot;rainforest\\&quot; or \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; for me.  It&#x27;s not flowery or particularly fresh smelling, but a pleasant odor nonetheless.</li>
