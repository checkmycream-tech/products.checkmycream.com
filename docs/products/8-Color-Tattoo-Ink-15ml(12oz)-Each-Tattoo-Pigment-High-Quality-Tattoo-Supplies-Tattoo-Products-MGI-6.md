    <li> The colors are amazing. Great product</li>
    <li> These inks worked pretty well, didn&#x27;t fade as much as some of the other inks that I&#x27;ve used in the past but they are pretty good. I had to go over a tattoo a few times for the ink to stay in there good enough though but they are good for the price that you pay.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BUY, IT WAS RECALLED!!!! TATTOOED MYSELF AND IT GAVE ME AN INFECTION ON MY LEG!!!! NEEDLES FROM THIS PLACE WAS RECALLED AS WELL!!!!! DONT BUY!!! I KNOW THIS FROM DEEP RESEARCH</li>

    <li> it came in on time just as expected. the ink was all there and undamaged. the quality of the ink was lacking the colors were not vibrant as they should have been, the ink was watered down. and recently i seen a post about this brand being recalled for bacterial contamination of the ink. i recommend researching the brand of ink before you by or get a tattoo, professionally in a studio and in a house.</li>
    <li> It was a present and my son was very happy with it. It more than did the job it was for.</li>
    <li> i got them alot earlier than expected and they stick great and are very vibrant colors and do great would recomend to any beginning tattoo artist</li>
    <li> Product is what they say.</li>
    <li> This product did not arrive in a timely manner , It took 3 weeks and 4 days to get to the final destination.  With that being said the application was fairly good to the skin. The best color to use is the red and apply it with a the white is alright just dont go crazy with it. Would have given more stars but I just cant. I do NOT recommend this product use STARBRIGHT or EXTENZE</li>
    <li> Fast shipping no problems at all. I used the ink and it turned out to be great ink and showed up really good no complaints thanks for the products</li>
    <li> Smell funky, and colors take longer to heal... but white shows great after healing!!!</li>
    <li> this stuff has been recalled and banned in certain areas due to it giving bad infections from its use. Stay away from it.</li>
    <li> Great colors , they came fast and i tatted with them the first day and the show up great on the skin , just gotta see what it looks like after the healing process .</li>
    <li> Gets the job done, good value for the money.</li>

    <li> Crap ink! Low quality and not true to color.</li>

    <li> I was disappointed with this ink the black was more of a light black not a dark vivid coal black like I would have liked.
