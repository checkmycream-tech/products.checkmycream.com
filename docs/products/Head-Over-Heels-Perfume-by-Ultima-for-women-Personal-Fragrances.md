    <li> I used to wear this perfume years ago and could not find it in the stores anymore. I randomly came across it on Amazon.com and stocked up. Bought one as a gift for my sister too. I always get complements when I wear it. Great price too. I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
    <li> When I searched for a perfume I was looking for a fresh peach sent. Not sweet, just light and musky. I read the other reviews for this perfume and decided to get it.&lt;br /&gt;The perfume was not the peach I was looking for, and gave me a headache. I am sensitive to some perfumes, so I put it back in the box. I ended up giving it to my mom since she liked it. For the price I do not regret getting it, since someone in my family does like it.</li>

    <li> This was my moms perfume that I had found a few years ago. She passed away when I was younger but I remember the scent. The bottle she had, I uses as my own until there was no more. It&#x27;s my number 1 scent. Brings back my childhood memories.</li>
