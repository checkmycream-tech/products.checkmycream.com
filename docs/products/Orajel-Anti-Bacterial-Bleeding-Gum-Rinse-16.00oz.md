      <li>I think this is an effective tool to combat the development of serious periodontal problems but by no means a replacement for routine dental cleanings.  </li>
      <li>Walmart sells a Equate Alcohol Free Oral Rinse Antiseptic with the same active ingredint for half the cost for 50% more product.  </li>
      <li>Orajel Anti-Bacterial Bleeding Gum AntiPlaque Mouth rinse is specially formulated to be absorbed into the tissue along the gum-line, and kill, or, at least inhibit the harmful bacteria that cause gingivitis, and the swelling that causes toothache pain.</li>
      <li>Orajel is a old school name on oral health products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very powerful and it takes care of the bleeding gum issue within a few days of use.  </li>
      <li>Due to other health issues, I have not been able to get to the dentist on a regular basis.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been hard to find here in the midwest stores but fortunately, I found a couple vendors through Amazon.com, which I&#x27;m grateful.  </li>
      <li>hard to clean mouth with all the hardware.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Gums started to bleed. hard to clean mouth with all the hardware. This stops bleeding and bad breath. would recommend.</li>
    <li> Actually I was looking for Amasan mouth wash but the price went up 10 fold, so I said, time to shop further.&lt;br /&gt;Tried to use half strength  Hydrogen Peroxide and it worked well and was inexpensive. Read that Orajel - Anti-bacterial Bleeding Gum Rinse help bring oxygen into the involved gum areas. I did not care for the taste of the product and the dental floss and regular brushing took care of everything, so I stopped the product.  I would use it again for a bleeding gum problem but not for routine care. I do not know the long term effects of the product. I am back to using Cool Mint Listerine Mouth Wash, every 12 hours and am satisfied.</li>
    <li> Taste isn&#x27;t  the greatest but it seems to be working. I can&#x27;t find it in the stores.</li>
    <li> Brushing 3 times a day just isn&#x27;t enough anymore. Most of the ethanol alcohol-based anti-septic mouthwashes promise you the world that they fight plaque, kill germs, and restore enamel. But, they just don&#x27;t come through for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Orajel Anti-Bacterial Bleeding Gum AntiPlaque Mouth rinse is specially formulated to be absorbed into the tissue along the gum-line, and kill, or, at least inhibit the harmful bacteria that cause gingivitis, and the swelling that causes toothache pain. It contains no alcohol and has a flavor resembling toasted marshmallows. It also minimizes overnight dry mouth.</li>
    <li> Good product fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Like the first reviewer, I tried this on a whim after reading the bottle in Stop N&#x27; Shop. I am an outrageous tartar former. I decided to try the product even though I don&#x27;t have bleeding gums, because the label says it also \\&quot;helps prevent\\&quot; them as well as its having antiplaque qualities. I used it for about a month in the morning and at night and after a week I could feel tartar actually coming off as a chalky substance scrunching between my teeth. I just went to the dentist last week and he could not find tartar to scrape off!</li>
    <li> The Orajel Antibacterial Bleeding Gum Rinse... I tried it on a whim.  It has a nice taste (no heavy aftertaste) and apparently works.  My hygienist confirmed an improvement of my gums during an appointment and recommended that I continue use.  It&#x27;s been hard to find here in the midwest stores but fortunately, I found a couple vendors through Amazon.com, which I&#x27;m grateful.  I ordered 4 bottles and the shipment was fast.</li>
    <li> very good  orajel i use it all the time could be any better,</li>
    <li> This is the frist time I used this product, seems to work very well.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to everyone. Good product and company.</li>
    <li> Over the years, I have had reoccuring problems with gum disease.  Due to other health issues, I have not been able to get to the dentist on a regular basis.  As a result, I obtained this gum rinse and a water pic.  I&#x27;m amazed at how effective this is working to sooth the irritation and get me through a period of time until I can get to the dentist for a cleaning.  The taste is not strong; just a hint of mint.  It also does not taste \\&quot;like medicine.\\&quot;  After a couple of weeks of using this (I pour 10ml of Orajel in the water pic reservoir in addition to swishing it around in my mouth), the gums don&#x27;t bleed when I brush/floss and they look healthy.  I also don&#x27;t get that funky taste in my mouth  in the wee hours of the morning that is a sign of gum disease.  I think this is an effective tool to combat the development of serious periodontal problems but by no means a replacement for routine dental cleanings.  It has definitely helped improve the health of my gums.  I will buy another bottle and keep using Orajel.</li>
    <li> can get for $5.99 at drugstore.com</li>
    <li> This is a excellent product, only wish that it could be bought in stores. I would keep buying it but I cannot afford to order it again because of the shipping cost. I would highly recommend for anyone who has bleeding gums.</li>
    <li> Taste horrible and doesn&#x27;t work. The only good thing about it was the soothing feeling on the gums after spitting it out. Still searching for something better.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. I have had tender gums for a long time. This includes having gone to the dentist and had a thorough cleaning.  The tender gums are thing of the past. Not only did the Orajel stop the bleeding it also helped reduce the depth of the pocket</li>
    <li> Cant Go wrong with this Brand and price you get for the amount you get is great. Works great give it a try but remember there no miracle pill or supplement for anything. Stuff Takes time so give it some time and also remember everyone is different  what works great for someone might not work for yourself. I did also get laser gum sugery since i had very bad gum health nothing i did to cause it just happen if you have to go that route for gum health laser surgery is best it pricey but it only real way to get rid of advance bleeding gums.</li>
    <li> This may do the job (I don&#x27;t know) but I found it so distasteful that I couldn&#x27;t use it. Also, alcohol-based mouth washes may increase the risk of mouth cancer.</li>
    <li> Best defense against bleeding gums ever invented.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very powerful and it takes care of the bleeding gum issue within a few days of use.  I use it once a day but if your problem is severe, directions call for twice a day use.  Refreshing minty taste.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully in making me feel better. Really wish it wasn&#x27;t an add-on item at times because I can&#x27;t always get $35 worth of stuff on amazon.</li>
    <li> Used for one week - resulted in parotitis - HUGE Salivary Gland out to the size of my ear - continued unabated for 36 hours seen in ER, and by three MDs - all other tests normal. Took 5 days to get over.&lt;br /&gt;FDA has info that product can cause parotitis - I also files another report on similar story</li>
    <li> THIS IS A LEADING PRODUCT FOR INSURING THAT YOUR GUMS REMAIN HEALTHY - PARTICULARLY FOR SENIOR ADULTS - NOT AVAILABLWE LOCALLY - IT IS THE TOP PRODUCT FOR THIS PURPOSE - ARRIVED PROMPTLY.</li>
    <li> Walmart sells a Equate Alcohol Free Oral Rinse Antiseptic with the same active ingredint for half the cost for 50% more product.  Using that now.</li>
    <li> Orajel is a old school name on oral health products. They make good ones. It helped allot.  Does not mean avoid the dentist but this can also help before and after. Glad Amazon had it to buy.</li>
    <li> This came shipped pretty fast in good shape...I am trying a few products from you and a few others that I can not mix use so what I can say is I think this is going to be one of my choices for maintaining good oral health tyvm for every thing.</li>
    <li> Worked good enough for me to buy it again.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S A PRODUCT THAT I LOVE TO USE.</li>
