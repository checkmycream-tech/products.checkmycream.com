      <li>Nice bendable leather.</li>
      <li>Nice Strop.</li>
      <li>It is really high quality, a wonderful value, really well made and looks awesome!</li>
      <li>Great for price and quick shipping</li>
      <li>Good quality and size/ width makes for easy use.</li>
      <li>A great strop is worth its weight in gold.  </li>
      <li>Also the length is quite adequate for a good draw.</li>
      <li>the quality is outstanding.</li>
      <li>These straps look great and are made very well.</li>
      <li>Very nice, high quality strop.</li>
      <li>Excellent product, highly recommend ... hangs nicely on the back of the bathroom door.</li>
      <li>The strop I ordered made it to me in 2 days and is a functional work of art that I am sure will be a joy to put to use as soon as the second razor I&#x27;ve ordered arrives..</li>
      <li>one is cheap but will get the job done.</li>
      <li>( as cheap ones always are )</li>
      <li>I invested in a Solingen First Class razor, 1k, 6k and 12k waterstones and a &#x27;cheap&#x27; strop.</li>
      <li>Makes my mornings easy and fast.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>Since I purchased this strop I have finally been able to maintain the blade with a hanging hair edge and have been able to get increasingly closer shaves and experiment with new angles and techniques.</li>
      <li>Well my only real test is how long you have to strop your straight razor to get an excellent edge  </li>
      <li>Beautifully made strop that should last you a very long time.</li>
      <li>You could easily pay a lot more for a lot less quality.</li>
      <li>The leather is very soft and although I accidentally nicked it with a very light touch of the keen edge, a careful rub with fine grit sandpaper smoothed it right out.</li>
      <li>When I bought this, I also bought a \\&quot;DOVO Prima\\&quot; and used it for the first time w/o stropping.</li>
      <li>If you use a straight razor, get this strop!</li>
      <li>I stropped the next time and the blade was much better feeling.</li>
      <li>I doubt my husband will be able to wear it out in the next 10 year&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>the other one is a decent strop that i had a barber friend of mine order for me years ago and it gave me years of service and is still in good shape.</li>
      <li>i own 2 other strops.</li>
      <li>Being three inches wide, it is very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Very high quality strop with a leather belt and canvas belt.  </li>
      <li>Now this is a strop, very well made, soft really gets the job done!!</li>
      <li>besides I hang it in the closet so it stays straight.</li>
      <li>It has been awhile since I have shaved with a straight razor</li>
      <li>- this strop is made with good quality leather, the Black Latigo Strop is not like the cheaper brands, The Black Latigo is  wide enough to strop the whole straight razor at once, many cheap strops are so narrow and small length wise and width wise</li>
      <li>Big enough to cover the whole blade...very high quality product, I would recommend this to anyone worth the money for sure</li>
      <li>It is soft right out of the package.  </li>
      <li>I am fairly new to straight razor shaving.</li>
      <li>Overall is a great purchase if you are serious about shaving with a straight razor.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this strop.</li>
      <li>Extremely high quality product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>i was a little intimidated by the price, but i am glad i bought it.</li>
      <li>When you consider the money you are no longer shelling out for razor blades that have become obsolete and require you to purchase a new handle for newer designed blades (or vise verse)</li>
      <li>Very soft .</li>
      <li>its like comparing a 1960 old rusted up truck, to a 2013 cadillac.</li>
      <li>but I have a drawer full of razor blades I paid through the nose for and the handles for 2 different models are broken and new ones aren&#x27;t available..</li>
      <li>This strop was made to last, it&#x27;s expensive but more then worth the money!</li>
      <li>Only issues I had was the price is a bit high</li>
      <li>I opted to buy a more expensive strap and some chromium oxide instead of shell out the cash for a more expensive razor and fortunately, I got the results I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I had ordered a new razor but the company I ordered it from claimed they had sold out of the one I ordered five days later..</li>
      <li>the leather wears out quickly - which means you would have to purchase another one after a few months.</li>
      <li>Keeps my straight razors edge perfectly sharp.</li>
      <li>I typically price shop for the least expensive product with the greatest utility, but putting a sharp edge against my face and neck justifies my spending a little more for a quality product.</li>
      <li>all of the time and the effect on the environment of throwing the plastic crap in the trash, a straight razor, strop and very comfortable shave is very desireable..</li>
      <li>if your having problems getting that little extra edge on your straight razor, (like i was) buy this strop, i was amazed at the difference it made.</li>

<li> you cannot fully strop your straight razor in the correct manor and if the strop is to thin</li>
<li> Absolutely no worries or concerns ~</li>
<li> With the 3\\&quot; wide Leather and Loom, you don&#x27;t have to stop with an x pattern.</li>
<li> and although I got it very, very sharp it could never really pass a hanging hair test</li>
<li> and I could only shave down to a small stubble.</li>
<li> ps - although it came rolled in a cubed box, it is thick enough that it didn&#x27;t affect surface...</li>
<li> This product beat my expectations hands down....</li>
<li> Logo is embossed on the strop (also hard to see in the picture.)  </li>
<li> Studs have engraving/detail that is hard to see in the picture.  </li>
<li> it was so hard it felt like I was on cement.</li>
<li> and I prefer a canvas strop as a secondary instead of the webbing included with this one.</li>

    <li> Beautifully made strop that should last you a very long time. Keeps my straight razors edge perfectly sharp.</li>
    <li> Strop was as advertised...Very Good Strop.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple years now and it&#x27;s holding up like a champ, the length and width of the strop is also really great. Hardware is exceptional too.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, highly recommend ... hangs nicely on the back of the bathroom door. Good quality and size/ width makes for easy use.</li>
    <li> this strop is awesome. i own 2 other strops. one is cheap but will get the job done. the other one is a decent strop that i had a barber friend of mine order for me years ago and it gave me years of service and is still in good shape. but this one is unbelieveable. its like comparing a 1960 old rusted up truck, to a 2013 cadillac. the quality is outstanding. if your having problems getting that little extra edge on your straight razor, (like i was) buy this strop, i was amazed at the difference it made. whoever made this strop realy knows his business. i was a little intimidated by the price, but i am glad i bought it.</li>
    <li> These straps are great. I opted to buy a more expensive strap and some chromium oxide instead of shell out the cash for a more expensive razor and fortunately, I got the results I was looking for. These straps look great and are made very well.</li>
    <li> Now this is a strop, very well made, soft really gets the job done!! I bought a scalpmaster horsehide strop after reading good things, got it and was never statisfied, you get what you pay for, I was nervous stropping my Dovo on that thing it was so hard it felt like I was on cement. This 30 Degree is QUALITY, MY MIND IS AT REST!!! Want a brown now,can&#x27;t sneak it by the wife. Buy It!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent Strop! How do I know it&#x27;s excellent? Well my only real test is how long you have to strop your straight razor to get an excellent edge  - this strop is made with good quality leather, the Black Latigo Strop is not like the cheaper brands, The Black Latigo is  wide enough to strop the whole straight razor at once, many cheap strops are so narrow and small length wise and width wise you cannot fully strop your straight razor in the correct manor and if the strop is to thin ( as cheap ones always are ) the leather wears out quickly - which means you would have to purchase another one after a few months. This strop was made to last, it&#x27;s expensive but more then worth the money!</li>
    <li> This strop is of the highest quality and will last a lifetime. It has four sides to cover every sharpening need.</li>
    <li> Very good qaulity 100 percent worth it</li>
    <li> It has been awhile since I have shaved with a straight razor but I have a drawer full of razor blades I paid through the nose for and the handles for 2 different models are broken and new ones aren&#x27;t available.. I am tired of spending so much money for mediocre products and decided to get serious about shaving the traditional, correct with a top quality tools.. I had ordered a new razor but the company I ordered it from claimed they had sold out of the one I ordered five days later.. The strop I ordered made it to me in 2 days and is a functional work of art that I am sure will be a joy to put to use as soon as the second razor I&#x27;ve ordered arrives.. When you consider the money you are no longer shelling out for razor blades that have become obsolete and require you to purchase a new handle for newer designed blades (or vise verse) all of the time and the effect on the environment of throwing the plastic crap in the trash, a straight razor, strop and very comfortable shave is very desireable..</li>
    <li> This product beat my expectations hands down.... Nice quality piece of leather, and since it is 3\\&quot; it is ample enough to cover the entire blade as you strop.... Only issues I had was the price is a bit high and I prefer a canvas strop as a secondary instead of the webbing included with this one.</li>
    <li> Big enough to cover the whole blade...very high quality product, I would recommend this to anyone worth the money for sure</li>
    <li> If I could give this thing twenty stars, i would.  It is soft right out of the package.  Being three inches wide, it is very easy to use.  Even if you are a beginner, dont be scared of the price.  A great strop is worth its weight in gold.  You could easily pay a lot more for a lot less quality.</li>
    <li> I was going to get a cheaper 2\\&quot; strop, but bought this instead. I am glad I did! With the 3\\&quot; wide Leather and Loom, you don&#x27;t have to stop with an x pattern. Makes my mornings easy and fast. When I bought this, I also bought a \\&quot;DOVO Prima\\&quot; and used it for the first time w/o stropping. I stropped the next time and the blade was much better feeling. I would highly recommend this strop.</li>
    <li> Very nice, high quality strop. This thing gives that extra touch to your edge. Highly recommend it. Nice bendable leather.</li>
    <li> Solid black stain on the leather.  Nickel hardware is excellent all around.  Studs have engraving/detail that is hard to see in the picture.  Logo is embossed on the strop (also hard to see in the picture.)  Bought it as a gift and the recipient was delighted with the appearance, craftsmanship, and functionality.</li>
    <li> If you use a straight razor, get this strop!</li>
    <li> Nice Strop. Very soft .</li>
    <li> Very high quality strop with a leather belt and canvas belt.  Hardware is substantial and attractive.  Would buy again and recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Awesome strop very satisfied with it honest its so cook the Thor the the the the thethe the they the</li>
    <li> This is truly a well made strop.  I doubt my husband will be able to wear it out in the next 10 year&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Extremely high quality product. Definitely worth the price. 3\\&quot; width is the only way to go. Makes a razor just \\&quot;sing\\&quot; when popping off those whiskers...</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this strop!  It is really high quality, a wonderful value, really well made and looks awesome! I am SO happy I did my research and got this strop for him for his birthday!</li>
    <li> Great for price and quick shipping</li>
    <li> I am fairly new to straight razor shaving. I invested in a Solingen First Class razor, 1k, 6k and 12k waterstones and a &#x27;cheap&#x27; strop. I studied and practiced a lot of honing and although I got it very, very sharp it could never really pass a hanging hair test and I could only shave down to a small stubble. Since I purchased this strop I have finally been able to maintain the blade with a hanging hair edge and have been able to get increasingly closer shaves and experiment with new angles and techniques. The strop itself is beautiful construction and I am quite proud of it. I appreciate the 3&amp;#34; width, treated backside and nylon strop. Also the length is quite adequate for a good draw. The leather is very soft and although I accidentally nicked it with a very light touch of the keen edge, a careful rub with fine grit sandpaper smoothed it right out. Overall is a great purchase if you are serious about shaving with a straight razor. I typically price shop for the least expensive product with the greatest utility, but putting a sharp edge against my face and neck justifies my spending a little more for a quality product. Enjoy!!  ps - although it came rolled in a cubed box, it is thick enough that it didn&#x27;t affect surface...besides I hang it in the closet so it stays straight.</li>
    <li> 3 inch width. Great material. Great Presentation. Would definitely recommend it for beginners and professionals. Absolutely no worries or concerns ~</li>
