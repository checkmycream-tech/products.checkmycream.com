      <li>Since Procter &amp; Gamble moved production to Mexico, the product doesn&#x27;t seem to be nearly as good as it used to be.  </li>
      <li>&#x27;s sounds too good to be true,&lt;br /&gt;etc, etc</li>

      <li>though i know this product is kind of a sample;</li>
      <li>We just wanted a good hair product for thinning hair which is better for scalp than over the counter.</li>
      <li>it kind of destroys the purpose of buying a set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love how it feels on my scalp and it smells really good.  </li>
      <li>Well, kind of.  </li>
      <li>kind of reminds me of Andes&#x27; mints.</li>
      <li>It looks like already used bottles were refilled with some kind of shampoo/conditioner and were sold here.</li>
      <li>Has a nice minty smell.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;d still say it was effective.</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know if it is the shampoo...or the combination of that with the vitamins and supplements I am taking.  </li>
      <li>The product is 100% effective, no doubt.</li>
      <li>I love the shampoo and rinse, but am not convinced the vitamins do any good.  </li>
      <li>suggestions on how to know if the NIOXIN system 2 shipped to me was original will be greatly</li>
      <li>The shampoo feels nice and cooling, and the conditioner feels even better because it tingles on your scalp.  </li>
      <li>My hair is very fine and with age, it&#x27;s a bit thinner.  </li>
      <li>My old DOVE shampoo worked better than NIOXIN !!!</li>

      <li>He has been pleased with it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it worked for someone people</li>
      <li>I have thinning hair, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s hereditary.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Problem area was top front of head.</li>
      <li>so when i do use it, if i like it i will purchase more</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Did not use as one of the bottle was half full.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what the deal is, but my hair was/is noticably thinner after a month of using these products.  I am not happy.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a reaction with a chemical in my well water or if I just respond badly to it - but I am CERTAIN this has caused my hairloss.&lt;br /&gt;Before using this, my head of hair was holding steady.  I asked my hair stylist about some products to help retain/regrow hair.  At first she even said that she hadn&#x27;t noticed any hair loss and thought I didn&#x27;t need to worry about.  I pressed her further and she said her husband uses the nioxin.  So I tried it.  And after about 6 weeks of using it, I felt I was actually LOSING hair.  Upon my next visit for a haircut, my stylist said she actually noticed my hair was THINNER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, at this point I stopped using the Nioxin and I&#x27;m  *HOPING* that the hair I lost from this comes back.</li>
    <li> I DOESNT DO ANYTHING FOR ME EXCEPT MAKING A LITTLE GREASY MY HAIR AFTER A WEEK.&lt;br /&gt;IT SUPPOSED TO HELP HAIR LOSS AND IM LOOSING MORE.&lt;br /&gt;I WILL GET BACK TO USE GARLIC SHAMPOO ALSO AT AMAZON AND IS ONLY 5 DLLS</li>
    <li> This system was without blemish.  It performed exactly as it was supposed to.  No problems.  Shirley Schweser</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle cure, but it does work--much to my suprise.  My hair looks thicker and is not quite as limp.</li>
    <li> I love the volume the cleanser gives my hair and the scalp therapy is very tingly on the scalp. I have noticed less hair loss over the past 2 weeks and does not dry my hair out.</li>
    <li> My hair has been thinning on the top for several years now, but lately it has really started coming out.  I have done some research on supplements and have started taking those...so I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll be able to tell if it&#x27;s that or the shampoo or a combination.  So far...not much change, but I&#x27;ve only been using this for two weeks.  I do like the way it cleans, leaves my hair shiny and manageable, which is difficult to do with partially gray hair.  This product does not promise to regrow hair, just to make what is there SEEM thicker.  I&#x27;m not seeing that yet, but again, only two weeks in.  If my research is correct, the underlying problem is a deficiency in vitamins and minerals together with bad effects from some OTC meds.  I have stopped those, added supplements...we&#x27;ll see.  I&#x27;ll update further down the road,,,especially if I do see any improvement in the rate of hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/28 Update!  I have quite a lot of new hair coming in...it&#x27;s about 1/4 inch long mostly around my hairline.  Also, it has stopped falling out like it was.  Before, everytime I brushed my hair, I would clean a double handful out of my brush...now it takes at least 3 - 4 days to collect that much.  I honestly don&#x27;t know if it is the shampoo...or the combination of that with the vitamins and supplements I am taking.  I&#x27;m just pleased with the fact that both seem to be working.  Plus I really DO like the way it cleans, without drying out my hair.  My hair LOOKS healthier.  I will definitely keep using this product.</li>
    <li> Since there were only a few comments, I ignored them because I have used this product for many years and have always thought it did a good job of thickening my hair as well as being a good shampoo and conditioner.  While the conditioner (scalp therapy) is relatively unchanged, I find the new formula shampoo to be unusable.  I gave it a good effort for just over a week, thinking that the system would work.  As another reviewer mentions, it has a tremendous drying effect on the hair, so much so that the conditioner almost has no impact after the shampoo&#x27;s use.  The hair turns out noticeably harder, frizzy and generally unmanageable.  The shampoo hit the garbage can today.  I no nothing of where or how the manufacturing process works for the company, but all I can say is that my shampoo of choice for easily 10-15 years is now gone.</li>
    <li> My husband won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> This product did not bring the desired results.  It was recommended to me by a friend, but I don&#x27;t think I will recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Has not helped me yet.  Scalp also itching.</li>
    <li> Product works great. Ordering was quick and easy!</li>
    <li> Great product! My hair is in good shape, not falling out as much as it was</li>
    <li> This was great shipped on time and no problems.</li>
    <li> 63 years old fine thin hair that was falling out A LOT!&lt;br /&gt;in two weeks hair completely stopped falling out. My hair is growing fast and I mean FAST. And my receding hair line in filling in . My hair looks GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;I read all the reviews so happy I read even the bad ones . I don&#x27;t have any idea why it didn&#x27;t work for them but this stuff if fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Try it buy the starter kit if it don&#x27;t work for you your not out a lot of money but if it does you&#x27;ll be like me. And buy it and buy it and buy it&lt;br /&gt;My biggest fear is that they will stop making it.</li>
    <li> Waste of money and time</li>
    <li> This shampoo has made my hair look thicker.  If I use another shampoo, my hair looks much thinner.  I have had others tell me I look like I have more hair, so I will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> Thank you fast delivery! Good product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for mail pattern baldness.  It does make hair look fuller.</li>
    <li> Since Procter &amp; Gamble moved production to Mexico, the product doesn&#x27;t seem to be nearly as good as it used to be.  The Scalp Therapy used to really tingle on my scalp and now it doesn&#x27;t do anything other than just sit there.  Apparently, they closed down the U.S. manufacturing plant and started producing Nioxin in Mexico.  It appears to me they may have also changed the formula.  Either way, I don&#x27;t perceive the same thickening effect it used to have.  This is unfortunate because I used to really love this product line.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my hair.  Would not recommend or buy again.  Just another case of it&#x27;s sounds too good to be true,&lt;br /&gt;etc, etc</li>
    <li> Great Product for scalp and beard instead of soap, love this product!</li>
    <li> I have used couple other products before I started using this. I did not see any great results. My hair was thinning from almost an year and one of my friend suggested this product. I have been using this for more than a month as described and I did not see any difference in my hair line or thickening. I want to try the lastest one the nioxon system starter kit 4. I will update once I use that for couple months.</li>
    <li> I have thin fine hair and the amount I was leaving the shower drain started to worry me.  So I figured I would try the Nioxin System 2 starter kit after the reading the many reviews. The first time I used the shampoo, I really liked the tingle and followed the routine with the conditioner and scalp treatment.  After my hair dried, it was straighter than usual and it felt like there was nothing to it and looked noticeably thinner.  Mmmokay - I followed through on the second day and the amount of hair that came away with the shampoo freaked me out.  If anything, my hair looked and felt so incredibly thin I was worried about putting it in a pony tail holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually afraid of using this product again as I don&#x27;t want to lose anymore hair! I need what I have!  I&#x27;m glad it worked for someone people but this product certainly didn&#x27;t not for me.  I&#x27;m sending it back, thank you very much.</li>
    <li> My hair felt dry after washing and conditioning. I would not recommend it to any of my friends or family</li>
    <li> Very concentrated and a better buy when you super size the bottles. I loose very little hair and it makes my hair feel and behave better. I have thick fine hair. I am aware that cultivating new hair may take up to 3-4 years of continual use of this product.. Nothing else has worked as well. There are no miracle products out there anyway.</li>
    <li> The product doesn&#x27;t smell horrible and it cleans my hair.  However, I did not experience any hair thickening or improvement as I was told would happen.</li>
    <li> It was OK but I didn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really work on regrowing my hair, but I think the treatment works for thickening my hair</li>
    <li> I have just started using the Nioxin. My sister-in-law is using and is happy that hair loss seems to have stopped. I am hoping for the same results, time will tell. I do feel for the money, the bottles are small, but have noticed a small amount seems to go a long way.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a week now and i can say that i did not like the smell of it the very first time i used it because i didn&#x27;t wash my hands and i had used too much first time.. but it&#x27;s not anywhere near urine and the smell of it is hardly something to detract from it it&#x27;s neutral .. i can say i&#x27;m 25 and have thin hair and can see my scalp normally but i can say for sure i&#x27;m happy with this purchase it definitely makes my hair thicker by far and i will report back if i see growth.. i love this product though and mixed with a medication i imagine could be life changing for some people.. i&#x27;m not currently on any medications and never have been for hair growth.. i am really impressed and with it and will continue to purchase it.. i would only suggest this product for people with thin hair but not a hopeless depth into balding.. 5/5!</li>
    <li> Love the product. I have used ur for a quit awhile. I have used other products but get the most results from nioxin.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. don&#x27;t bother</li>
    <li> My husband loves this system. He immediately noticed more fullness of his hair.</li>
    <li> Shipping was super quick.... love that. Wish conditioner was a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using the Nioxin system for a couple of months now and he isn&#x27;t crazy about the (lack of) results. It may take several months to see a difference, not sure. He complains that Nioxin drys out his scalp and as a result his head is very itchy.</li>
    <li> I can feel it working.</li>
    <li> Awesome price I will always buy this here</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t survive without my Nioxin 2 shampoo/conditioner set. I often buy this smaller pack and ship it directly where Im traveling so I can have my shampoo during a vacation or trip. I wish they sold even smaller travel versions though..</li>
    <li> I started using this after losing quite a bit of my hair from starting a thyroid medicine. This product works great. The scalp treatment is VERY light and does not make my roots greasy, like other products. I have tried other products, and this is by far my favorite! All products have a minty smell, but i don&#x27;t mind it so much. It is actually pretty refreshing.</li>
    <li> Not for sure yet if I am getting any new hair--it has only been a couple of weeks since my purchase.  However, my hair is definetly fuller--more volume-- and I like that.  Also it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> We bought this for for my husband. He&#x27;s not through with the first set, but his hair looks fuller and thicker. I am very satisfied so far.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and with age, it&#x27;s a bit thinner.  This product was recommended by a dermatologist and I don&#x27;t know that I have new hair growing, but I&#x27;m sure it has given my hair and scalp a boost.  My hair looks better and feels much less fine.</li>
    <li> First off this is a small size, dont expect it to last long. I have thinning hair and did not expect it to grow hair, just make it thicker....that did not happen. I used this stuff after I had to buy some more because this starter kit did not last. I used it every day for 2 1/2 months and I did not see any difference, sometimes I think I lost hair, and that it made my scalp itch. It does smell ok and give you a sensation to the scalp as others have said....but I did not notice any thickining at all. Sorry, truth hurts!!!</li>
    <li> This product is not for every hair type. Although I utilized Nioxin&#x27;s hair evaluation tool to select my system, it proved to be NOT a good product ... at least for my hair. My shiny hair with a natural, but admittedly strong wave pattern, turned to dull, friz and fuzz. My hair texture also changed to rough and dry, in both appearance and feel. Even topical hair moisturizers did little to help. My hair did, however, appear to be fuller (but only because it was fuzzy). Also, in an effort to return the product, I was not happy with Costsell&#x27;s customer service at all! Nor what I consider to be \\&quot;dismissive\\&quot; responses, all done via email. Eventually, after being just as persistent with my replies, I was directed to contact the manufacturer for a refund; however, that in itself was a nightmare! Perservence, and multiple online searches, eventually lead me through a maze of possibilities to eventually contact the actual manufacturer. I will get my money back once the company receives proof of purchase (which I have already mailed), BUT they said it will take about 2 months; hopefully, that proves not to be the case. I will NEVER again purchase a Nioxin product OR any product from Costsell. Signed: Not a Happy Camper</li>
    <li> love it but unsure why the shampoo and conditioner are not the same size.</li>
    <li> according to my husband my hair looks fuller, darker and healthier then before. I love the way my hair looks and feels</li>
    <li> I have went thru one of these sets and fixing to start on my second set.  I&#x27;m gong to have to use it several months to see if it works (that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star). I can definitely tell that my hair is not falling out nearly as bad as it was before I started using this. Plus I do like the way that all 3 products makes my hair feel. I paid almost twice the cost on my first set (I got it at a salon)...so I&#x27;m glad I checked Amazon before I went and purchased the 2nd set. I am a WEN girl ....so I was hesitant to change shampoo ....but I have learned that I can still use them in conjunction .&lt;br /&gt;I joined &amp;#34;Amazon Prime&amp;#34; last year and I have decided that this is the only way to shop. Amazon has the best prices. The free 3 day shipping is terrific...and....if you need to contact Customer Service...the Amazon agents are terrific to work with :)</li>
    <li> The effect of this shampoo is immediate and powerful, but&lt;br /&gt;Even though i know this product is kind of a sample; however,&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t it still too small for 20 somthing dollars?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still balding but i think this is slowing it down. and I like the way it makes my hair feel</li>
    <li> Good price for a specialty hair product. Many products over charge with promise of growing more or thicker hair. We just wanted a good hair product for thinning hair which is better for scalp than over the counter.</li>
    <li> I have used it twice in last 5 days. On first use, I lost lots of hair (more than earlier shampoo I was using). But most of such products take 5-10 days to show effect, I decided to go ahead and use it 4 more times. On second use, I lost again lots of hair, may be little less compared to first time use. I can tell one thing for sure that it has made my hair coarser and appear thick. I am not liking the change in texture as I have silk smooth hair and it doesn&#x27;t feel like that anymore just after 2 uses. However, the company claims that it will make your individual hair thicker. and hence overall denser..which seems to be working well. I just hope that this hair loss stops after 3 more uses, otherwise I am giving up on this one. My intention to buy this product was to minimize and stop the hair loss. (I have Asian Indian hair, medium thick and silky, I started experiencing hair loss all of a sudden in past one month and hence wanted to try this product)</li>
    <li> The packaging of this problem was well protected from all types of weather.  I would definitely order from this company again.  The kit has been excellent for my hair.</li>
    <li> Been using for about 3-4 months. Use it all the time, but not seeing any progress at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using System 2 for approximately 2 months now, and I really like how my hair looks and feels.</li>
    <li> Nioxin system works really well on thinning hair.  It prevents the loss of hair almost immediately.  The cool feeling of the peppermint is very noticeable.</li>
    <li> Gave me dandruff and itchy scalp. I saw no benefit in 30 days</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost two months following the instructions and I don&#x27;t see any results.  I&#x27;m not sure why it gets so many positive reviews but it feels like I bought some modern day snake oil.  :)</li>
    <li> If it were not so expensive, I would never look at another hair care product again. My hairfall stopped completely, I noticed fresh growth and healthier hair, and that too within a month. (I have dry hair and I wash it twice a week). Also, I oil my hair and have to use excess shampoo to get it out, but not with Nioxin. A little went a long way. The product is 100% effective, no doubt. However, I have some (minor) issues-&lt;br /&gt;1. Expensive....though I grudgingly admit its worth the money, but still&lt;br /&gt;2. I do not like the smell. Particularly after using &amp;#34;Scalp Therapy spray&amp;#34;, the medicinal smell stays and I hope that the people around me don;t notice it.&lt;br /&gt;3. The conditioner and scalp treatment run out faster than the shampoo...it kind of destroys the purpose of buying a set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is in much better condition now, so I am thinking of buying just the shampoo to see that works for me.</li>
    <li> I like this item so far, it starts working great after the first wash! I have lost a lot of hair since surgery, and I am starting to tell that my hair is looking healthier and fuller!</li>
    <li> It made my hair like straw.  How do I return it for my money back.  Also made my scalp itch.</li>
    <li> not worth the money.  my fair actually broke more after using this product so it was returned with no issues from the vendor</li>
    <li> Did not see any results and found out that the formula was changed and this is not the Nioxin I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I went to see my stylist and she just couldn&#x27;t get over at how thin my hair was getting. She asked me if I had started any new medication and I had for Thyroid.  it was making my hair fall out with slight bald spots.  I was horrified when she showed me the thinning spots, and when I&#x27;d been using my curling iron my  hair had started to stick to the iron and burn off.  I&#x27;d used the same Marcel Iron for years and always had  it on the same setting so I couldn&#x27;t understand why all of a sudden it was burning my hair off wrapped around the Iron.&lt;br /&gt;My stylist recommended Nioxin Starter kit for my hair, but the only draw back you have to use it every day.  So I bought the Kit and tried it. I can tell the difference in only a  month.  I loved it so much that I also bought the foam which add&#x27;s a lot of volume to my hair, you leave that in the hair while it&#x27;s wet, then style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do highly recommend this product to anyone with thinning hair.  Like anything you won&#x27;t see results over night, but if you stick with it you will see a difference.  I intend to toss out all of my old shampoo&#x27;s and styling products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nioxin does have every styling product you need even hair spray.  I highly recommend it and am glad I started using it before I lost all my hair!  Give it a try and stick with it .&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Donna</li>
    <li> works great..they could make the conditioner and scalp therapy a little larger&lt;br /&gt;always have a lot of shampoo left, but that&#x27;s on Nioxin not the seller.&lt;br /&gt;shipped ultra fast..great price..very happy</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo and rinse, but am not convinced the vitamins do any good.  Would like to buy the parts separately.</li>
    <li> My son loves it. Seems to be helping him.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It doesn&#x27;t dry my scalp out and it makes it look like I have a full head of hair. It is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Was a little sceptical but I have a friend that works in a salon and she reccomened this to me.  I have been using it for about a month now and trust me it works.  My hair is fuller and looks healthier.  I would reccomend using it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I used the system 1 and it went really well, I know with the system 2 will be even better.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit at a salon back in September and have been using it ever since. It works, I&#x27;ve noticed a big improvement to the appearance of my hair, however this kit forces you to continuously buy new product. You only get half of the amount of conditioner (5oz) as you do shampoo (10oz), so you&#x27;ll inevitably run out of conditioner when you&#x27;re only halfway through the shampoo. It&#x27;s been about 3 months and I&#x27;m still on my first set of shampoo and scalp treatment, but about 8 weeks into using the kit I ran out of conditioner. I decided to buy this kit because it&#x27;s 1/2 the price that I got it for in the salon, but I&#x27;m quickly realizing that I&#x27;m going to run out of the conditioner from the 2nd kit at about the same time the shampoo and scalp treatment run out from the first kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and just buy the individual bottles. The larger sizes will probably last you 6 months to a year and you won&#x27;t be constantly ordering new product every two months or so. The product works great, but I&#x27;m only giving this kit 3 stars for the tricky sales practices.</li>
    <li> Since I first used Nioxin I have used nothing else.  It does everything and more than it says it will do.</li>
    <li> Tried it at suggestion of hairdresser.  Because I didn&#x27;t know anything about the &#x27;system&#x27;, I ordered the system of shampoo, conditioner and scalp treatment. I found the shampoo and conditioner good cleansing products but no better or worse than many other &#x27;volumizing&#x27; cleansing hair product made by other manufacturers.  BUT, the scalp treatment is a must-have in my opinion.  My hair is thinning a lot I and found the scalp treatment helpful in making my hair appear fuller.  When it&#x27;s time to reorder, I&#x27;ll just order the scalp treatment</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin hair products for about a year now. I have noticed a difference in my hairs&#x27; appearance and thickness. I will continue using these products because I think they&#x27;re a good value and quality.</li>
    <li> My hair is thinning and this product helps keep it healthy and full.  I see areas that were thinning beginning to fill out.  What a blessing.</li>
    <li> Best product on the market without voodoo ingredients.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair look and feel thicker.</li>
    <li> Just started using this as it was suggested by my barber.. little itchy when u apply the cleanser and therapy  .... and i think the volume of liquid in other two bottles are not upto proportion, so i am sure you will run out of scalp therapy and treatment thing way before the cleanser... i will update about its effect when i see any...</li>
    <li> really like this stuff have used before and it worked to regrow hair. Would use again because it works great</li>
    <li> Now why would you make the conditioner bottle smaller than the shampoo bottle?  This makes no sense.</li>
    <li> This product stopped my hair loss in its tracks and an added bonus I have seen some new growth too</li>
    <li> I used to love this stuff it used to work really well . And though it did show a little less hair loss it dried my hair to the point of where it was like straw. No conditioning treatments have tamed the frizz or damage since I used the nioxin.  I don&#x27;t know what happened to the quality of the product but I can definitely tell it&#x27;s not the same sad. I will no longer purchase this product.</li>
    <li> My son has alopecia and had lost much of the hair on his head and other parts of his body.  After a couple weeks of using the 3 steps of Nioxin treatment we started to see new growth.  We are now on our 3rd order of this and are amazed at the amount of hair that has come back.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work at all...absolutely no results after using the product as stated on bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;biotin supplements seemed to have worked much better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and yes i&#x27;m referring to hair thickness with this post, not growing new hair</li>
    <li> This combo is worth it as the shampoo is super efficient. The small bottle will last you a few months. If you use it frequently your hair gets used to it and won&#x27;t dry out or anything.</li>
    <li> For my son he loves it</li>
    <li> I actually bought the wrong system as my hair is medium coarse and the system i bought was for fine hair, but it still worked perfectly.  The system had been recommended by my hairdresser as my scalp was flaky no matter what i did.</li>
    <li> I love how it feels on my scalp and it smells really good.  I have been using it for almost a month and a half and it&#x27;s been great on my hair and scalp! #NioxinChallenge #spon</li>
    <li> Read reviews how P&amp;G changed up the formula on this and it was ineffective now. I bought this out of curiosity and suggestions from my brothers. After a couple weeks of use I had visible improvements with my scalp condition. Also noticed much less hair loss while showering. This may not be the same product as before but I&#x27;d still say it was effective.</li>
    <li> First round, minimal results.</li>
    <li> no noticeable difference with my widow&#x27;s peak. i used it just as the instructions told me. i&#x27;d like for my forehead to be a bit fuller with hair and i didn&#x27;t get that satisfaction. i gave it two stars because i did like the sensation and smell on my scalp.</li>
    <li> Let you know how it works, but the service was excellent</li>
    <li> Thanks for the shampoo. Not happy with second bottle but hoping to get a refund and be delighted with seller and deal with them again with better reveiw</li>
    <li> My hair couldn&#x27;t handle these products...left it very dry. Would still order other products from this seller</li>
    <li> It has been 2 weeks since I started using the product and the only thing it has done for my hair is fry the ends.  I had to stop using the shampoo and conditioner and only use the scalp treatment.  Not really sure if it will do anything for me.  My hairdresser promoted the product saying her other client started seeing results after 2 uses of the product.  It certainly does not work for me.  Too good to be true.</li>
    <li> 5 months after having my daughter I went to the doctor because I was losing a lot of hair. While I know this can be normal, it still concerned me. She recommended that I try this shampoo and conditioner treatment. I&#x27;m always skeptical of products like these that claim to miraculously help ailments. But so far I like it and it seems to be working. While I am still losing a lot of hair, it&#x27;s not as much as it was before. I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now and there is a difference in my hair and its thickness. It has definitely gotten thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself smells really good and works really well. Normally I have to wash my hair twice to get it clean, but with this I only have to use the shampoo once and it&#x27;s clean. The conditioner makes my hair really soft without it being oily (I have oily hair). The only downside to the conditioner is that I have to use a lot of it to use it the way it is intended. The leave-in treatment doesn&#x27;t create build up. Again, I have oily hair and so normally I can&#x27;t use leave-in products. It may be a little on the expensive side, but I&#x27;m glad I purchased it!</li>
    <li> Bio in was sold to me without the shampoo! Buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles I did receive was refreshing.</li>
    <li> Quality Shampoo and conditioner.  But for hair regrowth, don&#x27;t expect anything.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice and so far I find it a very good product. My hairdresser gave it good reviews as well</li>
    <li> I feel the product did not work for me, but in addition, caused more of my thinning hair to come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been told this product may not work for everyone, but did not know it will cause more hair loss and thinning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin for at least 10 years--not because my hair was thinning (age is doing that) but because of my scalp psoriasis. The cleanser is gentle and leaves my hair smooth and shiny, but the scalp therapy is what I cannot do without. It soothes and calms my scalp. It doesn&#x27;t smell like medicine, but clean and minty. The red, scaly, painful patches have disappeared and only creep back when I&#x27;m not using this product. I have not found another shampoo/conditioner that treats scalp psoriasis as good as Nioxin!</li>
    <li> step 3 of this treatment i don&#x27;t like because it dries in your hair like hairspray. I would recommend to use that at night before you go to bed and than wash out in morninh</li>
    <li> Very pleased with speed of delivery and cost of product!</li>
    <li> Wow, after a week of using this, it&#x27;s made a pretty big difference. My hair looks and feels more full.</li>
    <li> Returned the whole kit. Waste of money hope and time.</li>
    <li> This came in perfect condition and the price was even better!</li>
    <li> I did not like this product at all. It did not thicken my hair nor make it appear thicker. What a waste. If anything it made my hair apear thinner.  I do not recommend this product to any one.  I&#x27;m sure going to the doctor to find some vitamins or a diet would be a better way to treat your thinning hair. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because my best friend stated she has always used it on her hair. I am not sure the product really works because I did not use it exclusively. That is why I gave it three stars.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner work so well with my fine hair. When I think I should just use a less expensive brand I pay for it with split ends and limp, flat hair.</li>
    <li> I have used Nioxin for over 8 or. 9 years and it is the best product for thinning hair. Amazon also has it at the best price ever. When I first started using&lt;br /&gt;It I used to pay $50.00 or more.</li>
    <li> I have used it before to help battle hair loss after illness or childbirth. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I do however, use the conditioner at the scalp and use a diff brand in the length. I noticed a dramatic difference in the amount of hair lost within two weeks maybe less. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> As a 47 year old male who is loosing his hair this is a must have as it helps</li>
    <li> Mid 20&#x27;s male, and my hair is just starting to thin. I thought I&#x27;d give this a try, but after three weeks I didn&#x27;t really see or feel a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does feel great on my scalp and the whole process leaves my hair feeling awesome.</li>
    <li> Product was just as advertised. I&#x27;ll purchases for this supplier again for sure!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the product and am able to see a small improvement.  I am hopeful to see more improvement over time. #feeling encouraged.</li>
    <li> This product really works!  I&#x27;m not sure that my hair is any thicker - think you&#x27;d have to do a scientific analysis for that, but my hair definitely appears thicker and is much easier to style.  Another plus is that my hair is shinier and I have NO scalp flakiness (something I&#x27;ve been bothered with for years and have never been able to control before this product).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell if it will help my hair re grow but I can already tell it&#x27;s a little thicker and has more volume. Definitely glad I found this product as I&#x27;ve tried several others that left my hair oily and/or left a buildup on my scalp.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my hair stylist because of my thinning hair.  I found that my hot hair curling dryer was collecting a lot of my hair.  When I began using this product I was very happy to find that my hair stopped loving my dryer and my comb.  However, I have since been trying to remove chemicals from my life and I have found that the shampoo sold by Beautycounter (a direct marketing company) works just as well without toxic chemicals.</li>
    <li> Love it. It feels much better than stuff off the shelf.</li>
    <li> Product recommended by medical doctor.  Product does not smell like medicine.  Hair is growing after approx two weeks will order this product again</li>
    <li> It made my hair too soft and unmanageable.  I gave the products to a friend and did not keep them to use.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using this product more than 2 weeks, so I haven&#x27;t yet seen much change in thickness of hair. But my hair is more manageable and styles easily. After 24 hours it still looks good.</li>
    <li> Makes my fine hair appear fuller. Takes my bald spaces disappear .  Can&#x27;t do without it anymore.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Repurchasing for the 100th time. Love this line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 5 months now and I have noticed the start of some hair growth on the top of my forehead.  I already ordered a second kit, and hope that it continues to work.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I had tried Nioxin, it has a nice smell and I will try it again.</li>
    <li> I sent this to a friend and it was delivered according to the schedule.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product I use it myself and can see the difference&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traderbill</li>
    <li> I have very thin, fine hair and have been using these products for about 3 weeks.  There is a noticeable difference in my hair as far as fullness and body.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I am going to keep using it because part of my hair loss is Medical and  my hair does feel somewhat fuller.  I like the way it makes my hair soft.</li>
    <li> Yes, like previous comments the quality is not the same any more.</li>
    <li> Hubby uses this. Does seem to help but nothing miraculous.</li>
    <li> I received as expected on time. The package was perfectly new. I am satisfied with it and for the price its offers it is a must to buy.</li>
    <li> Been almost a month and my hair does seem to be stronger and appear thicker. Also helped with my dandruff without drying out my hair like other products. Overall its pretty good, just tough to beat male pattern baldness without a prescription or Rogaine</li>
    <li> I started using the system mid-December of 2013. It was recommended by the person cutting my hair. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but after the first month, I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  When I went back to get my hair cut last month (January), I went to a different stylist who asked what I used because she saw so much new hair.  Since then three people whom I hadn&#x27;t seen for a while asked what I had done because I looked so &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and good.  I&#x27;m sold on this stuff!</li>
    <li> my hair is still thin, but I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s the shampoo&#x27;s fault. The product works as described and doesn&#x27;t smell weird.</li>
    <li> Just been using a few weeks, so have not used long enough to see significant hair growth.  Hoping that I will soon.</li>
    <li> I love Love LOVE this system. Nioxin system #2 is perfect for my hair. Because I use a heavy clay substance to style my hair, like American Crew Fiber or Molding Clay, I need something that will deep clean my scalp and hair. This does the trick and makes my hair feel more full. I have a tad bit of thinning on my right side (sort of a birth defect I guess you can say) but with this system, my hair actually looks normal on that side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this particular set, is that you receive a larger bottle of Shampoo than you do Conditioner. 9/10 times, I always run short on Conditioner before Shampoo. I might suggest purchasing the 1 liter bottles separately.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and did not receive what was claimed. Instead, I received system 1 cleanser and conditioner. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be 28 in a couple weeks and my hair has been thinning for a couple years now.  It was pretty thick to start with so you probably couldn&#x27;t tell if you saw me in person, but it&#x27;s definitely thinning.  When I get out of the shower I can see more and more scalp all the time, and the top/back is recently noticeably thin even when it&#x27;s dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nioxin doesn&#x27;t make me grow more hair (nor does it claim to), but it definitely makes my hair look thicker after I use it.  It&#x27;s hard to explain how, but it gives it that sort of clean, rough look, as opposed to the thin, oily look.  Also, it seems to have totally cleared up my dry scalp issues (after about a year and a half of use), which is a nice bonus.  I&#x27;ll definitely keep using this stuff until I have to take more drastic measures.</li>
    <li> Have been using for 1 month and have not noticed a difference.  Still losing a lot of hair and doesn&#x27;t feel fuller.</li>
    <li> I have heard that since this is now manufactured in Mexico that the formula has changed.  I used to feel these items working on the scalp.  Now nothing, no tingling or scalp sensation.  I will look for an alternative.</li>
    <li> Cleans well smells good  not much so far with hair growth but time will tell. Next review will have more info</li>
    <li> Awesome product does thicken hair seems to help with my psoriasis</li>
    <li> Used the entire set, did nothing for me!</li>
    <li> This product was initially recommended to my after complaining of thinning hair. I am in my mid-30&#x27;s and have started to encounter thinning on the top of my head. I used this product initially about a year ago but didn&#x27;t repurchase it because of the cost. However, at some point this year I got a gentle nudge from my wife that maybe I should consider picking it back up again. And so I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say whether the shampoo and conditioner are really better than what I could pick up at a store. The real benefit from this kit comes from the scalp therapy that you put on your hair after getting out of the shower. It definitely gives my hair fullness that I can&#x27;t get from any other product. I also like that it has a clean and not-greasy feel. So my 4-star review is based on that: my hair looks better when using this kit.</li>
    <li> Used for about three weeks and don&#x27;t see what the hoopla is about.  Not much of a volumizing shampoo.  Any decent Aveda volumizing conditioner does a better job.</li>
    <li> Husband very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Good product but I think this is really a supplemental product to a medication.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> It has been 55 days since I got and started using these products. The conditioner lasted 20 days, the foam 30 days and I still have a bit of the shampoo left (wash hair every other day now but I used them everyday for the first 30 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem area was top front of head. Besides seeing more scalp than hair in that area (specially when wet) I felt it was becoming more sensitive to combing, reason why I gave Nioxin a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sensitivity has been going away and I do see more hair in the area (specially when dry). My hair also feels better than before, as if the shampoo leaves a coating that gives it a special softness. So, I am content with the results so far when compared to all other shampoo brands I used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could post pictures, which I took at day 1, day 15 and day 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this combo.</li>
    <li> I used this product religiously, the shampoo, conditioner and scalp treatment for 6 months and would continue to see hair just fall into the sink and my brush get just as full as prior to using it. Now, all I have used for a year is Baking soda with a couple drops of Lavender Castille Soap and a ACV rinse with a couple drops of Lavender a couple times a week and maybe my hair isn&#x27;t any thicker but at least I don&#x27;t see it fall into the sink every day like I once did.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 15 years. It has slowed the thinning of my hair dramatically. I am 73 yrs old and my hair is very healthy.</li>
    <li> For rid of the itchiness but still no signs of hair growth. This may be just a very expensive shampoo product.</li>
    <li> Good Price, great product</li>
    <li> Get it stop thinking about it</li>
    <li> have used this for some time and find that my hair is heathier.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel great. I really feel like it is getting thicker. Well worth the investment. Makes my scalp tingle.</li>
    <li> I had a haircut in MA when I was visiting there.  The hairstylist used the Nioxin System and told me to use it.  I was very impressed with the product and that&#x27;s why I bought it from you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Nioxin System works!!  I look and feel like I have a whole new head of hair!  If you have fine hair and it is thinning a lot,&lt;br /&gt;I think you will be surprised at how amazed I was after a few months to find the shampoo and conditioner really did it&#x27;s job!!</li>
    <li> This kit does just what it states it does. It helps thinning hair if one uses it consistently. Nice product.</li>
    <li> Everyone says it&#x27;s not the same as before. I&#x27;ve been using this for years and i am happy with it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, plain and simple. I thought I&#x27;d give it a go, but there is no measurable difference after the period suggested by the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I see no hair growth.  I do see thicker hair.  Overall, for less than 15$ it&#x27;s been worth it to me.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is okay--strong peppermint smell, I suppose because it&#x27;s meant to be astringent.  The conditioner is okay except that you can waste half a hot-water tank standing under your shower trying to squeeze it out of the bottle.  I ended up slicing the bottle in half and spooning the conditioner into a wide-mouth jar.  Neither (over the course of two months) has noticeably thickened my hair.  As for the scalp treatment: a horror.  It stiffened my hair into multiple wires that lay plastered separately against my skull.  Even brushing my hair with a hairbrush (something I do not recommend for thin hair) failed to soften it or to persuade the little wires to get back together again.  I cannot imagine that ANYONE&#x27;S hair would benefit from this treatment.</li>
    <li> Which is better for loss hair?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and regret when I run out. My hair looks better and feels thicker.</li>
    <li> This product has a minty, tingling feel, and makes my hair super clean and bouncy. It adds body and shine, and my hair feels a lot healthier than before. This group of products is a great way to go to maximize and nourish your hair if you do not wish to use monoxydil. I have been using it for 2 months now, and In combination with my hair vitamins, I am pleased with the result. I am sure the results will improve even more over the next several months.</li>
    <li> Received product in timely manner. Everything was there, purchase was accurate. Can&#x27;t elaborate much else because hair products don&#x27;t work over night. Feels like it&#x27;s working while using product, hoping for the best. Can&#x27;t give over three stars at this time because lack of results, which isn&#x27;t the sellers fault.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks, and I swear I can already feel a difference! My hair feels much thicker and much healthier! will definitely continue using!</li>
    <li> I used for 3 months but of no use</li>
    <li> I love this kit! It has helped my hair so much. I would suggest this for anyone that needs it. It has made my hair thicker and healthier. My aunt uses this too! Love it. Buy it every time!</li>
    <li> I loved this when I first started using it. I was losing hair and I saw little bits growing back but then it stopped working.</li>
    <li> I have used this product system for one year now and it has help me regain thickness to my hair. I had hair loss due to some medical issues and my Nioxen helped me to recover hair growth in thickness over the past year. I am extremely happy with the results!</li>
    <li> The Nioxin System is great.  I had breast cancer, lost my hair, found this helped in making my hair not fall out and thicker.</li>
    <li> Thanks. Received item as listed</li>
    <li> Love Nioxin! Love this product line!</li>
    <li> It worked!  Well, kind of.  It&#x27;s no miracle product but my hair is noticeably thicker. I&#x27;m a white male with fine blond hair (read: thinning) and this product did work for me.  It didn&#x27;t help replace hair, just thickened what was already there.  It also didn&#x27;t really thicken it THAT much.  I took before and after pictures and there is a noticeable difference though (after a month of consistent use, not after just two weeks).  For the price, it&#x27;s certainly worth a try.</li>
    <li> the product got here very quickly. it makes hair look fuller, but if sleep on wet hair, hair is little oily feeling if use all three steps.</li>
    <li> The Nioxin system is repairing my hair and keeping in cleaner than all previous products, I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband because he tends to lose a lot of hair under stress. It is growing back. Products also arrived quick.</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell but it seems to be working, less hair loss during shampooing and hair looks better, healthier.</li>
    <li> Shampoo seems fine, and the conditioner seem fine.  I stopped using the foam after a few weeks.  I did not notice any reduction in thinning; I think it actually made it a little worse</li>
    <li> Not the good ol&#x27; American made stuff, made in Mexico.  Doesnt seem as strong I dont get the tingly feeling I always got in the past.</li>
    <li> Nioxin 5 worked. I hope the #2 system is even better for my hair. I&#x27;m too young for thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I lost my hair during chemotherapy and was completely bald.  I wanted to do whatever I could to safely re-grow my hair as quickly as possible.  The employees at the salon where I purchased a wig recommended Nioxin.  This kit was only about $25 with shipping and is plenty of product for my needs.  It has shampoo and conditioner/scalp therapy that you use daily in the shower, and then a scalp treatment that you leave on after you dry off.  I havent experienced any unpleasant side effects, and my hair is definitely growing in!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, been using it for a year, extremely noticeable results.</li>
    <li> I read other posts about it drying out peoples hair. I use this product then also use a  leaving in conditioner, or use Panteen before being done with hair regime in shower, the product is working and i have had no issues with dryness.</li>
    <li> Goodby dandruff. Great feeling hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Nioxin System 2 Kit for a couple of weeks. It is too early to tell if it is helping with the thinness of my hair, but it has helped with my hair feeling more healthy. Not only does my hair feel more healthy, it is much more manageable. I am optimistic for this to work.</li>
    <li> Good product. The shampoo is ok. The conditioner really helps with volume. Of all the products in the package, i would recommend the conditioner. The shampoo is om but a bit overpriced.</li>
    <li> These products are expensive, so good to purchase package deal.  Appears to work well with my fine hair. Like it.</li>
    <li> The Nioxin System 2 has been workking for me. My hair getting thicker and stronger. No any side effects discovered yet...</li>
    <li> I used as directed but have not seen any difference.  I read a lot of reviews saying the formula had been changed.  too bad.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> my husband loves the product.  He has been using it for almost one year and it is helping.  He&#x27;s more confident about his hair</li>
    <li> Oh my god words can&#x27;t even describe how much I loveee this product! First time I used it I could literally feel added thickness to my hair already in the shower my hair has never looked fuller I love it! I don&#x27;t have thinning hair... just trying to get thicker hair and this product did it for me I will continue to purchase ♡</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect miracles</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product.... My hair is now starting to grow again.  yea......My hair feels clean and soft.  Thanks much for this product and making it affordable.  I have a feeling I will be using this product for a long time not just because it&#x27;s working but because how great my hair feels.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything to help me with my hair loss I do not recommend the products although service was good.</li>
    <li> My hair has improved a great deal no more thinning but had to change to system 4 due to coloring my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair looks fuller since I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin system.  There&#x27;s also less hair breakage.  I would recommend the product for anyone with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Have not seen any improvements after a month of using it</li>
    <li> Unless you are losing hair because of lack of blood to the scalp this wont do much more than extra volume shampoo.</li>
    <li> immediately. It wasn&#x27;t like a miracle happened but there was a noticeable difference after the first use. WIll continue to use it.</li>
    <li> very good, my hair is starting to grow and look thicker, shampoo smells really good. Recommend it, try it yourself and be happy</li>
    <li> Honestly no clue if you can honestly tell if this works, How could you possibly gauge the retention and loss of a hair growth pattern?</li>
    <li> meh, if you want really something that works try cedarwood essential oil</li>
    <li> First time use of the product by my wife.  She is very pleased with it after a few uses.  I will say that the shipment was damaged upon arrival and there was some confusion and miscommunication in dealing with the vendor.  However, it was ironed out and a replacement was received.  Vendor representatives were very nice and took extra effort to insure that we were satisfied!  That gets them a 5 star rating in my book!</li>
    <li> I been using it for 1 month and I can&#x27;t see any different , but hair is really thin. I plan on using until these are all done. Then I will see after that</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo.  Makes your hair feel so clean and fresh. I am not impressed with the other two products.  will continue buying the shampoo.  Did not notice a difference when using the other products.</li>
    <li> Has a nice minty smell. Can&#x27;t say the conditioner really helped. Found the foam of no use, but might buy the shampoo/conditioner combo again.</li>
    <li> made my hair frizzy and dry.  tiny amount of conditioner not enough to detangle hair.  leave in product makes MORE tangles ....so all in alll pretty sure it made my hair THINNER</li>
    <li> This is the same as I was getting at the salon for a much better price.  It is a good value.</li>
    <li> My hair looks and feels thicker.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for your hair. I have thin hair and it makes my hair thicker, super smooth, and I can go longer without washing my hair.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but after about a month I am a believer! Hair looks and feels thicker!</li>
    <li> Item not as described. I did not receive a scalp treatment, only shampoo and conditioner. This is going back.</li>
    <li> My hair is so fine and thin this product seemed to me to accelerate further breakage and hair loss. For someone with coarser hair but thinning it may work well.</li>
    <li> It does help your hair strands look thicker.. Only downfall is the conditioner doesnt help with knots in your hair. Wish is was a little thicker to help smooth it out and help with frizz. More hair falls out when you brush it because the conditioner is no help. It really is just a scalp cleansing system .. Made my scalp feel fresh and clean</li>
    <li> The shipping was super fast and I have been using Nioxin for several months because I have hereditary that makes the women in my family have thin hair, and it thins the older we get.</li>
    <li> One star because it did not work and it just made my hair fall out more, it is a waste of money</li>
    <li> This stuff made my hair appear thicker. I wanted  better results so I switched my shampoo and got some minoxidil.</li>
    <li> Nioxin system two is awesome. My neurologist prescribed a medication that caused my hair to completely fall out. My beautician recommended trying Nioxin. I began using it on May 14th, 2012 and today (July 22, 2012), I can say my hair is thicker then ever. It&#x27;s growing back really quickly and is so soft and manageable. Definately worth a try.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like the product shipped to me was genuine. It looks like already used bottles were refilled with some kind of shampoo/conditioner and were sold here. There is no kind of SEAL which protects original the contents from replacement. So decided never to buy these kinds of products from people who sell them on websites like amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any suggestions on how to know if the NIOXIN system 2 shipped to me was original will be greatly appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks in Advance!</li>
    <li> Works well so far. It has a nice scent and a cool menthol &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; feeling to the scalp. I can definitely see a thicker hair appearance.</li>
    <li> the shampoo is good. conditioner is half of the size.  keep the 3rd bottle, i will probably never use it.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work at all for me. I got along with the Nioxin Diamax and it only seemed to make it work. I gave it my all - used it for 3 months - and still did nothing.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the suggestion of my barber. I like the shampoo, and I like the conditioner. For normal use, they work well and smell good. But after two months of use, I&#x27;ve not noticed any improvement to my thinning hair, which is why I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well. At least it was an inexpensive experiment.</li>
    <li> The combo feels good, and I may be losing less hair, but my hair part is still too big.  Menopause sucks.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using these products for years.  He is still losing his hair but there is no way of knowing if this products has slowed down the process.  He has been pleased with it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s working. very slowly but surely...makes my hair pretty in the mean time at least. I wish the conditioner bottle was bigger because I run out quickly.</li>
    <li> Works good just was shorten a bottle only 3/4 way full. Hummm product works good love the tea tree hoping for a full bottle on next order</li>
    <li> I bought this item because it is Nioxin. No good. I want to return it. Just sitting in my cupboard</li>
    <li> Prior to using the system 2 kit (shampoo, conditioner &amp; treatment) whenever I washed my hair, there was a noticeable amount of hair in my hands. My pillow case would have hair that had fallen out on it as well. I noticed within a week or two that my hair stopped falling out after using this stuff. I&#x27;m about 7 months in, and my hair does appear fuller in the areas where my scalp didn&#x27;t bald through. The bald spots have not grown back in, I don&#x27;t think Nioxin makes that claim, but it has certainly stopped the hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend people get on this when they first notice hair loss in order to prevent it, but once you have a noticeably thin area, it&#x27;s not going to grow back. I&#x27;m still leaning on the fence whether to embrace my balding and just start shaving it, or keeping with this product and just keeping my hair short so it&#x27;s not as noticeable. But Nioxin system 2 did and does work for me as far as preventing further hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also note that some of the negative reviews have stated there is a smell to it; it&#x27;s not an offensive smell by any means. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume or fruit as you&#x27;d find in your average shampoo, but it&#x27;s a saloon product and as such, it smells appropriately. The smell doesn&#x27;t stay in your hair after you rinse it out.</li>
    <li> It works for me and my hair is very thin. I ran out so just bought another shampoo that claims the same thing and my hair looked thinner within 2 days. I will never buy another shampoo again</li>
    <li> Item as described - Prompt shipping</li>
    <li> find my hair is fuller</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin now for about six weeks.  I feel my hair is definitely getting thicker and it is definitely growing faster.  My husband rubs my head a lot and he is even noticing a difference!</li>
    <li> My hair got so thin I could not go out of the house.  This has helped greatly.  Thank you.  I will order more when it runs out.</li>
    <li> With the mixed review, I figured purchasing the system kit was a gamble. However worth the small investment to try it out versus being a woman with an increasingly balding head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree the shampoo does smell odd. It&#x27;s a light minty smell... kind of reminds me of Andes&#x27; mints. After almost 4 weeks of daily use, I began to notice less hair coming out when washing my hair. By week 5, my head went from \\&quot;noticeably thinning\\&quot; to thin hair. A improvement in my book! After 7 weeks I went on a week vacation and took normal Nexxus shampoo in my travel bag but brought along the leave-in foam. When I returned, my hair was heading towards noticeably thinning again but not nearly as bad as originally. I&#x27;m back on the daily regiment of using the shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in scalp treatment and my head is once again on the road to not balding. I wouldn&#x27;t say my hair looks fuller, but I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m balding anymore either... which is my main goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m curious what the earlier version of this product was like because this version is pretty decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone else mentioned in a review earlier, you don&#x27;t need to use much (about the size of a quarter) so this system lasted me well pass the month timeframe to notice a difference.</li>
    <li> I dont know if this product is truely working as a hair growth product.  IT may or may not be.  It seems like somehting you would have to use for a long time to even notice.  I have herd good things from others about it.  It smells really good and leaves your head feeling fresh.  Hoping to help thicken my hair</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I&#x27;ve used for a few years with great results.</li>
    <li> I have had chemo and my hair tends to be very weak. This really seems to be helping with the breakage because I don&#x27;t see anywhere near the amount of hair in my brush. I am going to order more right now!</li>
    <li> So after reading about all the amazing stuff this product does for your hair I bought the Kit.....  There is NO DIFFERENCE in my hair besides for the fact it drys it out !!!! Would no buy it a second time.......  My old DOVE shampoo worked better than NIOXIN !!!</li>
    <li> good for cancer patients regrowing or with thinning hair...</li>
    <li> Really helped tone down a stress induced bout of telogen effluvium. So glad I purchased this product. It worked after several other products failed-very impressed</li>
    <li> I think this was a fake product. I&#x27;ve used Nioxin before and saw results within a few days. I finished these bottles and my hair was still thinning and falling out. I ended up going to a professional salon to get the product. The salon brand worked with in a week.</li>
    <li> There was obviously a shipping error because I did not receive the set pictured above as ordered; rather, I received the liter duo set of shampoo and conditioner.  Nonetheless, I am able to give an accurate review of the shampoo and conditioner as I used both liters in their entirety.  For reference, I have shoulder length hair and the liters lasted me approximately 6 weeks.  Let me start by covering the most important thing, which is that after using both shampoo and conditioner for almost 6 weeks, I do not see any noticeable improvement in the thickness of my hair.  I am also experiencing hair shedding, and while I was not looking to this product for improvement, I was curious if it would have any positive effect on it...it didn&#x27;t, in case you were wondering the same.  The shampoo feels nice and cooling, and the conditioner feels even better because it tingles on your scalp.  For  my dry hair type, however, the conditioner was not very &amp;#34;conditioning&amp;#34; for the rest of my hair aside from my scalp, so I put the Nioxin conditioner on my scalp, and bought a drugstore conditioner to apply to the rest of my hair.  I was actually even noticing more hair loss in the beginning when I was using only the Nioxin conditioner, as my hair would be more tangly in the shower and come out when I would rinse and comb (with my fingers) the conditioner out of my hair.  Overall, the shampoo and conditioner are nice due to the tingling sensation they give, but for me personally they are not worth the money because they had no effect on my hair thickness either.  The diameter of my hair strands and overall appearance of my hair is not different than when I started.</li>
    <li> have not used it yet it is sitting on the shelf so when i do use it, if i like it i will purchase more</li>
    <li> Nioxin is far better then any product in market ,, i am using it from many years and they are just ow-some</li>
    <li> This  order was for my fiancee as she was prescribed by the salon to use this for her thinning hair. She&#x27;s liking it and I just ordered the bigger shampoo and conditioner. I will update this once she sees results which should be after one month of use onwards.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for husband and it really works for him. He has been using Nioxin system 2 for two years his hair looks much&lt;br /&gt;thinker then two years ago will continue to buy .</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t at all sure if this was a good idea or a waste of time when I purchased but my hair is definitely thicker having used this product for 3 weeks.  Can&#x27;t see any new growth yet but its still early on in the trial.  Will be buying again to continue using.  Got the best price here at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I used this and went from looking like Tellie Sevalis to looking like Lionel Richie.</li>
    <li> I cannot accurately rate this until I have used it. The 2 stars was just to permit this post. It will take time and usage before I can truthfully and accurate give it a revirew.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s placebo or not but I was starting to thin on top.  Tried this and it does seem and feel fuller.  I will continue to use it and see but hopefully this does the job.</li>
    <li> It is too soon to really rate this. I&#x27;ve just started using it. If it works, that will be great. Have to give it time.What hair I have left does seem fuller.</li>
    <li> Nice, but does it really work?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now, and I&#x27;m not noticing anything like what other people say theyve noticed.  I&#x27;m not really sure this product really works.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen noticeable change in the thinning of my hair; perhaps I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.  I will continue to use the product  with hopes of getting the results indicated.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser said I should be able to tell some change within 6 weeks and then more with time.  I haven&#x27;t been able to tell any difference at all.  Very disappointed</li>
    <li> I got this product because I&#x27;ve used Nioxin before and I loved how it left my hair feeling clean and smooth. I especially liked the mint scent that left my scalp feeling clean. Now that was with the Niosin System 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try this one to see the difference because I feel some spots of my hair are thinning a bit. I don&#x27;t know if the products vary much between systems but this one dosen&#x27;t really seem like the original. The cleanser is almost clear while in the system 1 is a very green/bluish shampoo. The scent is also very faint on this one which makes me wonder if they have changed their formula more or if perhaps this is just the system 2 formula. Anyways it does clean my hair and makes it feel clean, though I have to say it also feels a little dryer at times. I&#x27;ve only just started this so I will provide an update later on how this goes and if I notice any actual improvement in my hair.</li>
    <li> Works great! Aside from making my hair feel denser it thoroughly removes all the oily residues on my hair making it less greasy! Abstolutely recommend it! You see results almost right away!</li>
    <li> I never seem to see those hairs that fall out when I shower anymore.  Kit is as described.</li>
    <li> Do not expect immediate fast results. Each persons hair loss or thinning hair is different. With daily consistent usage my hair stylist and I have noticed gradual hair growth. I have thinning hair on the top/back of my head and it is definitely starting to fill in but you must leave the shampoo and conditioner on your hair for 4-5 minutes at each application while massaging your scalp to rejuvenate the follicles and stimulate future hair growth. Doing this you will feel the tingling sensation of the product on your scalp. You must also use the foam on your hair daily as well to reap the benefit of hair growth.</li>
    <li> This stuff had my hair looking and feeling thicker after the first use.  I started using it over a long weekend, and when I returned to work I got several compliments on how much body my hair had, and how full and good it looked.</li>
    <li> I was having really good results with this system but the last 2 purchases haven&#x27;t produced the same results in terms of appearance, fullness. Other reviewers mentioned a possible formula change so that may be it. I&#x27;m not sure. I&#x27;ve been loyal to this brand for a number of years and have been happy until recently. Maybe mother nature is just taking over no matter how great the shampoo is. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still recommend giving it a shot and see if it works for you.</li>
    <li> Because of my thinning hair I bought this product at the urging of my hairdresser.  I have only been using it a short time, but I plan on continuing to use this product because of the way it makes my  hair feel.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and I don&#x27;t see where it has hurt or helped my hair at all.</li>
    <li> I bought Nioxin # 2 for my boyfriend, haven&#x27;t see any difference, bless his heart I think he looks worst, I been searching for other alternative, for him and myself, I wouldn&#x27;t throw my money away.</li>
    <li> Maybe this helps a woman&#x27;s hair regrow, but does nothing for men.  Men&#x27;s problem as I read is one where DHA testosterone is the cause of hair loss and this doesn&#x27;t address that.</li>
    <li> Really pleased with this product.  Would definitely recommend to anyone who&#x27;s seeing more hair in their brush than they&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> Saw less hair falling out with the use of the producy, but did not experience growth...</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok I can&#x27;t tell much difference in my hair, but i don&#x27;t believe anything really works for fine hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this system twice now, and just don&#x27;t see where it is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;I have 50+ year old hair, and I just don&#x27;t see that it makes a noticeable difference&lt;br /&gt;Maybe on younger hair?</li>
    <li> I have previous used Nixoin and loved it (System 1) but my hair has been breaking and thinning so I chose System 2. I tried this product three or four times and it couldn&#x27;t be worse for my hair. My scalp is now dry and itchy and the conditioner was so weak that I had to deep condition my hair twice in a week to get a brush through it. This product does not have nearly enough moisture in it for my hair and has made my hair loss worse due to tangling. I am returning this and trying something else.</li>
    <li> It really works great</li>
    <li> Everything as advertised.  I am in the process of using it and seeing if it really works.  I will order again if it does.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it helps keep your hair color in.. It does make the hair thicker but doesn&#x27;t feel like I notice my hair getting thicker with growth.. Does grow but guess being 61 and your hair is suppose to thin out some.. This should help me.. I hope... I will keep buying it..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars for now. So far I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working. I have thinning hair, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s hereditary. I heard this product doesn&#x27;t help that, so it might not be for me.</li>
    <li> Awesome Nioxin Product</li>
    <li> It has been the only product that really does what the box says and the price is reasonable. I have never use conditioner, and the one included in the kit is great.</li>
    <li> I like system 1 better.  The smell is different and texture is thicker with this product.  Don&#x27;t see any difference in results compared to system1which I like better.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother.  She notices growth on the sides of her hair already. I have ordered a new shipment now.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nioxin for a while.  My thinning hair (due to thyroid condition) seems to be thickening up.  I would recommend it to anyone with thinning hair.  Takes a while to be able to notice the difference but my hairdresser can tell.</li>
    <li> No difference in hair growth or fullness noted</li>
    <li> My hair looks the best it has in 5 years and after 50 days is noticably thicker.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nioxin for about a month. My hair is not any thicker. However Nioxin leaves my scalp feeling very refreshed!!</li>
    <li> Exactly as I ordered thank you.</li>
