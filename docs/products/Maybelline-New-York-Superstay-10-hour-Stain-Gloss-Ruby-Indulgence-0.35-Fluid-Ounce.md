### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It tastes pleasant, too!!</li>
      <li>Great product!!</li>
      <li>this line is the best.</li>
      <li>but it looks great over my lipstick and lasts awhile!</li>
      <li>I have found the brown/corals are the best-and I am have very fair skin.</li>
      <li>The color is beautiful and its great for fall.  </li>
      <li>Great color, lasts forever.  </li>
      <li>Wears great and doesn&#x27;t smudge off.</li>
      <li>Looks great.</li>
      <li>Coverage is also great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extremely bright when I put it on, and the gloss starts out quite shiny.</li>
      <li>Love this product, so happy</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful, rich color, in the blue-red family.</li>
      <li>---there was no smearing with kissing :) and my lips still were still bright and even for pictures!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Goes on glossy then dries to a nice color.</li>
      <li>Love it and the whole ordering process and shipping time was great!  </li>
      <li>Love love love it!</li>
      <li>Since its a stain you get that great color all day and its super easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Wears very light.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lip tint, so it doesn&#x27;t transfer at all, and it fades nicely without getting on the fine lines of the lips or their edges.</li>
      <li>but I will use it for sure.</li>
      <li>each color option will be darker than the top of the tube.</li>
      <li>There are better lip stains out there.</li>
      <li>have used most of Maybelline&#x27;s &amp;#34;Super Stay&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>The color is great, and the wand to apply is really helpful.</li>
      <li>Nonetheless, I love the &amp;#34;Super Stay&amp;#34;Stain Gloss product</li>
      <li>I love this lip stain.</li>
      <li>Love the color and the way it goes on.</li>
      <li>I love this product, even though it wasn&#x27;t the color I was expecting, but I have to say it was my fault</li>
      <li>because I love the color.</li>
      <li>(If it means anything, my mom loves it, wears it always, and literally makes her look younger-not sure the etiology of this-</li>
      <li>It will be awesome if somebody could suggest me a similar formula from a cruelty free brand.</li>
      <li>this was my first of this brand of lipstick , but i do like it , it goes on well and stays on alot longer than most lipsticks !</li>
      <li>However this color is beautiful too, not as red as I wanted</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am ONLY giving this a 4* because of the pronounced color---for all the rest of the color line, I would give a 5 most assuredly!!</li>
      <li>Great color, lasts long on lips.</li>
      <li>The color is kind of scarlet pink-ish which is kind of dark</li>
      <li>The only good thing about this lip stain is the color.</li>
      <li>So quickly,</li>
      <li>My daughter love the color and ended up buying more in different colors.</li>
      <li>Additionally, if I apply it by these latter two ways, the color THEN will appear much more like the color on the top of the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANOTHER OPTION</li>
      <li>I discovered this Super Stay line, I used Revlon&#x27;s Just Bitten on my wedding day - and it worked just like you would want</li>
      <li>This color Ruby Indulgence is a very pretty fall, winter color.</li>
      <li>I have rather large lips, and it&#x27;s really easy.</li>
      <li>which is a quality rarely found when using any stain, gloss, or &amp;#34;long lasting&amp;#34; lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am wearing it right now.</li>
      <li>first off it does not stay on for 10 hours&lt;br</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>Pretty color lip stain.  </li>
      <li>dry.the only reason I don&#x27;t throw it away is that I always keep a clear gloss or balm with me.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely think there are better lip stains out there!</li>
      <li>Do not use this very often because of that.</li>
      <li>and then the whole product is unusable.</li>
      <li>, Sometimes I just go ahead and put it on &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; (per se) while I am getting ready, then give one kleenex &amp;#34;kiss&amp;#34; at the end of the &amp;#34;makeup application&amp;#34; which also works...and does make the color a bit darker.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;However-not to contradict myself-the color shown is very FUCHSIA-or ruby.</li>
      <li>Stain Gloss, Ruby Indulgence, nice color, long lasting.</li>
      <li>if the latter, I wash my hands right away as these colors are REALLY meant to stay!)...</li>
      <li>Honestly yes this does stain you lips,but after less than one hour it&#x27;ll dry out your lips making them look super stained and</li>
      <li>In &#x27;light&#x27;  :)  of this-I either put a few daps on my upper and lower lips then &amp;#34;fill in the gaps&amp;#34; with a cotton swab or w/my finger-(though</li>
      <li>(I didn&#x27;t get the reference correctly from my older one).</li>
      <li>but it does just rub off really quickly and all that&#x27;s left is the edges</li>
      <li>highly recommend this brand, deeming &amp;#34;NY Superstay Stain Gloss...as my #1 choice of all time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but for such a blissful stain gloss, its worth reapplying.</li>
      <li>Maybelline New York Superstay 10 hour</li>
      <li>I have to spread the stain-gloss quickly when applying or it will dry spottily.</li>
      <li>The color was a little darker than I expected, but overall a great product that lives up to what it promises.</li>
      <li>A really light weight gloss, not even a little sticky that lasts quite some time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I will occasionally use the Super Stay product then (up to hours later), brighten it up with the aforementioned &amp;#</li>
      <li>I tried a stain gloss before but it came with a marker like tip which made applying it much easier and less wasteful and comes with a much cleaner finish</li>
      <li>One time I bought a new tube and it seemed overfilled, so it was messy at first...</li>
      <li>I spent the two dollars or however much it was to buy this.</li>
      <li>Love it, the only downside is that is not a cruelty free product :(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love love love it! The color is beautiful and its great for fall.  Since its a stain you get that great color all day and its super easy to apply.</li>
    <li> The only good thing about this lip stain is the color. And it doesn&#x27;t even last 1 hour. The applicator brush fell off in the tube so I had to get another. it doesn&#x27;t come off on a glass but it does just rub off really quickly and all that&#x27;s left is the edges</li>
    <li> Poor won&#x27;t buy again can&#x27;t see it on to watery</li>
    <li> this was my first of this brand of lipstick , but i do like it , it goes on well and stays on alot longer than most lipsticks ! it does need to be reapplied after drinking and eating and after a couple hours .</li>
    <li> This review is for the color Ruby Indulgence. It&#x27;s a beautiful, rich color, in the blue-red family. It&#x27;s extremely bright when I put it on, and the gloss starts out quite shiny. I have to spread the stain-gloss quickly when applying or it will dry spottily. The stain-gloss tastes really bad if I accidentally lick my lips (which I evidently do a lot). My lips quickly dry out from the stain -- typical of stain products, but I had hoped the gloss component would improve my chances. Within a half-hour I have to put lip balm on because of dryness. The color is quite faded after two hours, and my lips are their usual color after three hours.</li>
    <li> Ruby is a Very deep red and I like it. Stays put. Looks great. Wears very light. What&#x27;s not to like.</li>
    <li> Way darker than I expected and doesn&#x27;t stay on very long.</li>
    <li> The color is a bit darker and its too liquidy. When you apply it with the brush you have to remove all the excess gloss on it or else you&#x27;ll have this layer of juice on your lips. It doesn&#x27;t last for 10 hours but it&#x27;s not that bad.  I tried a stain gloss before but it came with a marker like tip which made applying it much easier and less wasteful and comes with a much cleaner finish, I think you should go for one of those.</li>
    <li> Maybelline New York Superstay 10 hour Stain Gloss, Ruby Indulgence, nice color, long lasting., Bad thing is transferable. I recommend it</li>
    <li> Pretty color lip stain.  It goes on well and does have a shine.  It only lasted about an hour on me and not the 10 hours specified.  It has a slight transfer if drinking from a glass.</li>
    <li> Personally I didn&#x27;t like the product or the color</li>
    <li> It came in 2 days! So quickly, oh and it gave me updates on where it was. The color is kind of scarlet pink-ish which is kind of dark but I does seem to stay on.</li>
    <li> There are better lip stains out there. By no means does this last 10 hours though.</li>
    <li> Such a shame these are getting discontinued!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not cake or flake or dry your lips. A really light weight gloss, not even a little sticky that lasts quite some time. Definnitely not 10 hours... but for such a blissful stain gloss, its worth reapplying. It tastes pleasant, too!!</li>
    <li> This color Ruby Indulgence is a very pretty fall, winter color. It appears as a deep red. I am wearing it right now.</li>
    <li> Love this product, so happy I spent the two dollars or however much it was to buy this. I&#x27;m not that big a fan of lip gloss but it looks great over my lipstick and lasts awhile!</li>
    <li> This is DEFINITELY FUSHIA. Nonetheless, I love the &amp;#34;Super Stay&amp;#34;Stain Gloss product line!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used most of Maybelline&#x27;s &amp;#34;Super Stay&amp;#34; Glosses and have always been pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I am not technically the &amp;#34;expert&amp;#34; in lip color products--I wear lipstick every day [and have for decades ;) I have bought seemingly every brand/form/color--&amp;#62; all in hopes, &amp;#34;this or that would be the one&amp;#34;...!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPECIFICALLY related to this product line, keep in mind-each color option will be darker than the top of the tube. In &#x27;light&#x27;  :)  of this-I either put a few daps on my upper and lower lips then &amp;#34;fill in the gaps&amp;#34; with a cotton swab or w/my finger-(though if the latter, I wash my hands right away as these colors are REALLY meant to stay!)...Additionally, if I apply it by these latter two ways, the color THEN will appear much more like the color on the top of the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANOTHER OPTION, Sometimes I just go ahead and put it on &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; (per se) while I am getting ready, then give one kleenex &amp;#34;kiss&amp;#34; at the end of the &amp;#34;makeup application&amp;#34; which also works...and does make the color a bit darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other facet of this line IN GENERAL is when this does start to fade, it does so equally---which is a quality rarely found when using any stain, gloss, or &amp;#34;long lasting&amp;#34; lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this said,&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brand, deeming &amp;#34;NY Superstay Stain Gloss...as my #1 choice of all time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My SECOND choice is REVLON&#x27;s &amp;#34;JUST BITTEN&amp;#34;-a marker stain WITH a gloss attached. [Marker Stains withOUT the stick moisturizer/firm gloss {attached} will probably not provide the &amp;#34;long-lasting&amp;#34; outcome sought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will occasionally use the Super Stay product then (up to hours later), brighten it up with the aforementioned &amp;#34;Just Bitten&amp;#34;....(A tangent here----BEFORE I discovered this Super Stay line, I used Revlon&#x27;s Just Bitten on my wedding day - and it worked just like you would want---there was no smearing with kissing :) and my lips still were still bright and even for pictures!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to this product...One time I bought a new tube and it seemed overfilled, so it was messy at first...Until the overflow issue was resolved I just used a cotton swab, as I noted above-I sometimes do this anyways. BUT dont be dissuaded- this line is the best. (If it means anything, my mom loves it, wears it always, and literally makes her look younger-not sure the etiology of this-but please trust me when I say-give it a whirl)!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However-not to contradict myself-the color shown is very FUCHSIA-or ruby. I have found the brown/corals are the best-and I am have very fair skin. These latter colors seem to adapt/match whatever I am wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION-unless you want FUSHIA, make another selection---but just select another color, NOT another brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the prices through Amazon with all the SUPERSTAY glosses are 1/2 the store price...&lt;br /&gt;I am ONLY giving this a 4* because of the pronounced color---for all the rest of the color line, I would give a 5 most assuredly!!</li>
    <li> My daughter love the color and ended up buying more in different colors.</li>
    <li> When they say Superstay they mean it! I love this lip stain. Goes on glossy then dries to a nice color. I would give it 5 but the color stays on WAAAYYY longer than 10 hours. As in I have it on for six hours when I&#x27;m out, go to sleep, 8 hours later this bad boy is still on. And after 5 make up remover wipes.....my lips are still stained. Do not use this very often because of that. Unfortunetelt because I love the color.</li>
    <li> A+. Love it and the whole ordering process and shipping time was great!  Love the color and the way it goes on. It&#x27;s not sticky like a lot of stains. Wears great and doesn&#x27;t smudge off. Great product!!</li>
    <li> Great color, lasts forever.  I&#x27;m going to have to try out other colors too.</li>
    <li> Take a little longer than some to dry, and half an hour. Once dried it stays on all day. The color is great, and the wand to apply is really helpful. I could see it being difficult for someone with small lips though. I have rather large lips, and it&#x27;s really easy. Coverage is also great.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last that long and the applicator is a bit awkward and breaks off easily and then the whole product is unusable.</li>
    <li> Color doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour even less if I eat or drink anything.  :(</li>
    <li> The color was a little darker than I expected, but overall a great product that lives up to what it promises.</li>
    <li> Honestly yes this does stain you lips,but after less than one hour it&#x27;ll dry out your lips making them look super stained and dry.the only reason I don&#x27;t throw it away is that I always keep a clear gloss or balm with me.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely think there are better lip stains out there!</li>
    <li> first off it does not stay on for 10 hours&lt;br /&gt;the second you eat or drink anything its gone&lt;br /&gt;the tip to appy is terrible it is flat and make a mess when using it&lt;br /&gt;I do like the color</li>
    <li> This is a plain stain - has no advantage over any simple one dollar lipstick. It does not last and has no redeeming features.</li>
    <li> Great color, lasts long on lips.</li>
    <li> I love this product, even though it wasn&#x27;t the color I was expecting, but I have to say it was my fault (I didn&#x27;t get the reference correctly from my older one). However this color is beautiful too, not as red as I wanted but I will use it for sure. It&#x27;s a lip tint, so it doesn&#x27;t transfer at all, and it fades nicely without getting on the fine lines of the lips or their edges. It won&#x27;t last all day but I prefer a color which is going to fade gradually rather than have a permanent but uneven color. Love it, the only downside is that is not a cruelty free product :( It will be awesome if somebody could suggest me a similar formula from a cruelty free brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sad that this product is discontinued..that&#x27;s why I ordered 15 tubes of it! Love it!</li>
