    <li> My Favorite Body Cream.  Smells Good And With The VitaminC From The Orange, Grapefruit The Discoloration On My Hands I Gone.  So If You Have Age Spots This Cream Is For You.</li>
    <li> If you like citrus scents this one is just about perfect. It smells so refreshing and clean. The texture is smooth and silky without being greasy. It absorbs beautifully. I never want to live without this cream!</li>
    <li> Okay product.  Works fairly well.</li>
    <li> This is probably my favorite body butter I&#x27;ve ever tried. The price is around the $5 mark. It has a nice, thick consistency to it. It hydrates my skin &amp; softens scars I have. The smell is fantastic. I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the aroma of orange and grapefruit, originally I was looking for Orange body butter but didn&#x27;t find any , I decided to try Orange and Grapefruit and am glad I did, same creamy texture going on, same smooth and silky feel, and the added Grapefruit makes this body butter the best I&#x27;ve tried and will definitely order again when this runs out.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love the scent and texture.  Putting it on after a shower or any time is an experience in citrus pleasure.  Have used many different shea and body butters over the years but this is the number one favorite.</li>
    <li> I Love it but not the price.</li>
    <li> I discovered this body butter at WalMart the first time, but when I went back for more, I couldn&#x27;t find it any more. I was disppointed until it dawned on me to go online.  It comes in other scents but the orange and grapefruit is the best and, for me, it&#x27;s far superior to lotions. It lasts longer and the fresh scent lasts, too.</li>
    <li> Nice creamy texture but lacking in scent.  So looking forward to orange and grapefruit aroma...my favorites.  This product does not deliver.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful body moisturizer for dry skin.  Compared to many other body butters, this one absorbs quickly on your skin.  The citrus fragrance is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> For those of you who has very dry skin this product is great. After using this body butter the first time I fell in love with if. My skin is very soft and no longer dry. You must try this. Love Love Love</li>
    <li> Great, Great creme, adore the wake up smell and lifts me up so I feel much much better, ready to get busy.</li>
    <li> This body butter is very creamy and smells great. It definitely leaves your skin moisturized and soft, especially if you live in a dry area.</li>
    <li> Love this body butter. Great for dry skin and the fragrance is marvelous. Not overpowering, and very pleasant, could be used by men or women.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be as good as The Body Shop&#x27;s body butters.  The consistency isn&#x27;t nearly as smooth and moisturizing.  The fragrance isn&#x27;t strong enough for me.  I love pink grapefruit, lemon and orange fragrances.  This has that kind of citrusy smell, but it&#x27;s weak compared to The Body Shop&#x27;s version.  I was hoping to get something really similar to Body Shop body butter at a lower price, but I guess I&#x27;ll return to the pricier stuff.  I&#x27;m using it up, but don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
    <li> Love the product as it is not greasy yet keeps your skin moisturized. It arrived on time &amp; in excellent condition.  Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> Smells great smooth and creamy.  Fragrance is not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;What more can be said but it is a good product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product that makes your skin very smooth and silky.  If you are looking for a natural product that really works, this is the one for you!</li>
    <li> I work in an office where the air conditioning is on blast.  This product kept my skin from feeling tight at work.</li>
