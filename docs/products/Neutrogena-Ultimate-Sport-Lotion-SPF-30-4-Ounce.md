      <li>Outstanding product!!!!!</li>
      <li>ALL THE PRODUCTS I BOUGHT FROM NEUTROGENA ARE PERFECT FOR ME.  </li>
      <li>Good product!</li>
      <li>Great face cream.</li>
      <li>I was so happy when this arrived.</li>
      <li>Loreal makes a great UVA sunscreen but charges 3 times the money.  </li>
      <li>Not to get too rapturous over a sunscreen, but this stuff is great.  </li>
      <li>The search for a really good sun screen seems to go on without end.</li>
      <li>I have this product scheduled to be delivered once a month (which gives me a great discount) with free delivery from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a really nice non greasy sunscreen, i like it and will buy more</li>
      <li>/&gt;IT IS PROBABLY THE MOST RELIABLE BRAND ON THE MARKET.</li>
      <li>my favorite sunscreen ever</li>
      <li>Was able to \\&quot;rub in\\&quot; to my face.  </li>
      <li>Love the Neutrogena sun block products</li>
      <li>It does not have a strong smell, and once it dries you just forget it&#x27;s there.</li>
      <li>Perhaps the application in shade and absorption time is as important as they say.</li>
      <li>Item works great and lasts a very long time and is not greasy.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>I think it is just as effective, but let&#x27;s face it if you are more likely to use it that has to count for something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We did not burn but we got very tan and light burns in some cases when we wore this on the beach and in the water.</li>
      <li>This is probably the best UVA absorbing (as opposed to the physical blocking of zinc paste) sunscreen currently made.  </li>
      <li>Feels a bit greasy when first used, but the greasiness diminishes quickly.  </li>
      <li>Once a month is just about right for my level of usage (every day).</li>
      <li>This is good stuff that goes on well and sinks into your skin without much greasy feel.</li>
      <li>We like it very much.</li>
      <li>That is a major bummer because I think it is fantastic.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on oily and it seemed to stay on really well even when sweating.</li>
      <li>I enjoy this brand overall.</li>
      <li>I really like this sunscreen</li>
      <li>IT IS HIGH QUALITY COSMETIC WITH NO INGREDIENTS</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly, does not have that metallic odor, and does not feel powdery like the other Neutrogena sunscreen line.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and am prone to breakouts, but this has never caused me any problems.</li>
      <li>Even my 15 year old son is conscientious about it.</li>
      <li>It is a sport sunscreen, but it is not heavy or greasy at all.</li>
      <li>I was in the caribbean around late June, in the sun most of the day, and barely got a tan with twice-daily application!</li>
      <li>A relief based on others highly rated for protection that seem to have too much \\&quot;zinc oxide like qualities\\&quot; that raise questions during normal everyday applications of \\&quot;What is that on your face?\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I like this product because it has their highest concentration of UVA protectorant with less of the UVB protectorant (which gives it the SPF rating), which I like because I want less UVB protection (sunburn protection) and more UVA protection (cancer and skin damage).  </li>
      <li>No burns, of course reapply frequently if you&#x27;re outside for long periods of time.  </li>
      <li>I use it surfing, last time I got toasted through a thick application on my face and not that long in the ocean, but other times it seemed to prevent a sunburn better than others.  </li>

    <li> We&#x27;ve used this while golfing all summer during the bad drought/no clouds here in TX.  No burns, of course reapply frequently if you&#x27;re outside for long periods of time.  Feels a bit greasy when first used, but the greasiness diminishes quickly.  Love the Neutrogena sun block products</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a really nice non greasy sunscreen, i like it and will buy more</li>
    <li> ALL THE PRODUCTS I BOUGHT FROM NEUTROGENA ARE PERFECT FOR ME.  IT IS HIGH QUALITY COSMETIC WITH NO INGREDIENTS THAT IS BAD FOR YOUR SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS PROBABLY THE MOST RELIABLE BRAND ON THE MARKET.</li>
    <li> I believe this has been discontinued as I am having a hard time finding it these days. That is a major bummer because I think it is fantastic. It is a sport sunscreen, but it is not heavy or greasy at all. In fact, I wear it on my face every day beneath my makeup. I have tried countless sunscreens and moisturizers with SPF (including the SPF 70 face sunscreen from this same line) only to get greasy throughout the day, but not with this. It does not have a strong smell, and once it dries you just forget it&#x27;s there. I have sensitive skin and am prone to breakouts, but this has never caused me any problems. I have no idea what I&#x27;ll do when this disappears.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t give you an oily feeling. We like it very much.And I also like the smell. Good product! I think I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I really like this sunscreen but I think Neutrogena has discontinued it. It doesn&#x27;t go on oily and it seemed to stay on really well even when sweating.</li>
    <li> Great face cream. Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Thick as glue but really works to keep you protected from the sun when sweating and swimming. I was in the caribbean around late June, in the sun most of the day, and barely got a tan with twice-daily application!</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel wonderful and protected.</li>
    <li> Item works great and lasts a very long time and is not greasy. I will buy this item as long as the manufacturer makes it. Outstanding product!!!!!</li>
    <li> SPF 30 must not be enough. We did not burn but we got very tan and light burns in some cases when we wore this on the beach and in the water.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff that goes on well and sinks into your skin without much greasy feel. It doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes. It isn&#x27;t listed on the Neutrogena web site, so it appears to be terminated. Oh well. The search for a really good sun screen seems to go on without end.</li>
    <li> Was able to \\&quot;rub in\\&quot; to my face.  A relief based on others highly rated for protection that seem to have too much \\&quot;zinc oxide like qualities\\&quot; that raise questions during normal everyday applications of \\&quot;What is that on your face?\\&quot;</li>
    <li> ... perhaps it is because the expiration date has passed.  Mine just arrived, two bottles, both with an expiration date of 02/2012.  I promptly returned them both.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best UVA absorbing (as opposed to the physical blocking of zinc paste) sunscreen currently made.  Loreal makes a great UVA sunscreen but charges 3 times the money.  I like this product because it has their highest concentration of UVA protectorant with less of the UVB protectorant (which gives it the SPF rating), which I like because I want less UVB protection (sunburn protection) and more UVA protection (cancer and skin damage).  I have this product scheduled to be delivered once a month (which gives me a great discount) with free delivery from Amazon.  Once a month is just about right for my level of usage (every day).</li>
    <li> my favorite sunscreen ever</li>
    <li> I was so happy when this arrived. But when I saw that the expiration date is JUNE 2014 and I received it in APRIL. Well, what can I say? Use the whole thing in two months or it goes to waste?</li>
    <li> I enjoy this brand overall.</li>
    <li> Not to get too rapturous over a sunscreen, but this stuff is great.  It goes on smoothly, does not have that metallic odor, and does not feel powdery like the other Neutrogena sunscreen line. I think it is just as effective, but let&#x27;s face it if you are more likely to use it that has to count for something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in Arizona, sunscreen is a 365 day proposition.  Even my 15 year old son is conscientious about it.</li>
    <li> Skin burns briefly after application, before entering sun.  I use it surfing, last time I got toasted through a thick application on my face and not that long in the ocean, but other times it seemed to prevent a sunburn better than others.  Perhaps the application in shade and absorption time is as important as they say.</li>
