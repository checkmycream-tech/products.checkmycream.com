      <li>Most trimmers that you get will need to be adjusted in order to get the best cut from them.</li>
      <li>The Andis SuperLiner is a nice trimer, however, it&#x27;s not as good as the Andis Outliner II!</li>
      <li>Nice liners, lightweight and has an attractive casing.  </li>
      <li>this what i recommed for everybody that what to buy a good trimmer</li>
      <li>I loved using this trimmer the rotary motor works good to get through hair and</li>

      <li>This tool is remarkably easy to adjust, you don&#x27;t even have to remove the blade from the trimmer to do so!  </li>
      <li>I have a pair of Outliner II trimmers that I have had since 1992 and they are still going strong!</li>
      <li>so you can be very precise around your beard or neckline.</li>
      <li>this product has both pros and cons just make sure</li>
      <li>The outliner is a fantastic tool!  </li>
      <li>compared to the t - outliner which i love</li>
      <li>It is more than twice the price of the drug store models.</li>
      <li>it has a faster speed, more power</li>
      <li>This helps me get more even trims on my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the trimmer plugs into a wall outlet</li>
      <li>Any clipper can be adjusted perfectly but not every clipper can remained aligned for long periods of time because balance.</li>
      <li>i strongly reccommed people please do not buy this product it will cut your client or love one.  </li>
      <li>real light weight, lots of power, surprisingly stornger than the andis t outliner, real easy to use, its a llitle loud,the new detachable blade too soon to know if that feature is very helpful</li>
      <li>another good buy would recommend to someone who are in the market for a new trimmer.</li>
      <li>The blade has fine teeth</li>
      <li>I switched the blades and now i am super satisfied.</li>
      <li>They are light weight and thats a plus for those who cut for hours, but they feel as though they won&#x27;t have the longevity of the Outliner II by Andis.</li>
      <li>so I enjoy that feature</li>
      <li>It is a light oil with no petroleum order.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this shaver</li>
      <li>/&gt;The Sonic is great to use along side of these if you want a bald fade and such.</li>
      <li>great deal love how this smooth cutting trimmer works and it&#x27;s a great travel tool</li>
      <li>I have purchased other\\&quot;T\\&quot;outliners in the past but this one works out the best</li>
      <li>The ease of adjustment, the ability to change baldes, the extremely powerful rotary motor, and reducing my need to carry two trimmers makes my toolkit a lighter and more powerful.  </li>
      <li>bump the blades back and they are good with kids also.....</li>
      <li>This trimmer is light and is powerful.</li>
      <li>This tool is also very light compared to the classic \\&quot;T\\&quot; outliner.  </li>
      <li>Hmmmmm.[[ASIN:B0039OB0GC Andis Super Liner Trimmer]]</li>
      <li>As an added bonus, I carry two blades -- a factory set blade in addition to a \\&quot;hot\\&quot; blade so I can respond go what my client wants quickly and easily.    </li>
      <li>professionals may want something more powerful but for cutting my own hair this is great.</li>
      <li>clippers stay cool and are set right out of the box.</li>
      <li>well first i must say that andis never disappointed its buyers when it came to the sharpness of its trimmers....</li>
      <li>deff worth it</li>
      <li>Very light weight, blade stays cool, and rather quiet.</li>
      <li>so i went to my local Sally store with return policy with 60 day and bought the wahl 5 star razor it did not give me any problem no cut and a nice crisp line up</li>
      <li>The Superliners are worth the money if you are a Pro and cut for hours at a time, because they are light weight, they run cooler and they are more ergonomic than any other trimer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>It gives a very comfortable shave, especially if you want a trim close to your skin.</li>
      <li>This tool is a worthy replacement for the classic outlier.      </li>
      <li>But before i bought the trimmer i first checked out the videos about the trimmer on Google.</li>
      <li>i instantly fell in love with it and how crisp of a line it made</li>
      <li>First of all it does not posses the power of the Pro style Andis clippers.  </li>
      <li>Well I must say I had very high expectations about this product</li>
      <li>It cuts very well.</li>
      <li>The andis clippers are very well built to give you a close shaves.</li>
      <li>the design lets you get very close when doing a bald fade.</li>
      <li>And secondly, the materials appear to be cheaply manufactured.  </li>
      <li>So if there is anyone out there who has seen the andis superliner and is thinking about trying it, my advise to you is to go and get a pair because they are the REAL DEAL and perfect for all around cutting and shaving.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a high quality trimmer.</li>
      <li>would highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>After adjusting the blades, I get the closest comparible to a straight razor cut, a electric can provide so far.</li>
      <li>K Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer]] over the super liner trimmer.</li>
      <li>Most people &#x27;adjust&#x27; their outliner blades before use, so reviews that make a negative are really complaining about nothing.  </li>
      <li>Actually they are better looking than any of the other trimers by Andis.</li>
      <li>Overall, I would take another Superliner trimmer if given to me, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy another Superliner as long as the Outliners or T-Outliners are available.</li>
      <li>I started to return them, but I just loosened  the blade adjusted it to where I wanted, and now there super sharp.</li>
      <li>Also the blade&#x27;s teeth are very sharp and snag on skin when clean up the skin around the bottom of the beard.</li>
      <li>These trimmers also require some adjusting they are not sharp enough right out of the box at least not for my prefrence, they do run very cool and quite and will cut even the thickest hair with ease, as you can see</li>
      <li>Point blank the Andis Superliner is the best trimmer out, but not because of its dynamic cutting ability.</li>
      <li>The combs Amazon offers as a package deal</li>
      <li>I have used this trimmer twice so far</li>
      <li>i would definitely recommend these to any one who wants that steve harvey shape up....</li>
      <li>The drug store trimmers just can not keep up with a professional unit like this one.</li>
      <li>im a professional barber</li>
      <li>super liner is supposed to cut every single hair but doesn&#x27;t it performs just like the other 1 except without getting hot so because of this reason I give it 4 stars</li>
      <li>Hi everybody it just recently purchase this product and use it for the first or second time it cut my brother and client head</li>
      <li>He just had to tweak the razor a bit in order for it to cut like it was designed, so it didn&#x27;t work right out of the box like the Youtube and other web videos portray it.</li>
      <li>one to two passes is all it takes for a sharp crisp line.....</li>
      <li>it is very sharp right out the box.     </li>
      <li>The only problem I have with these are that they do not cut as sharp as I like right out the box.  </li>
      <li>B000RFS118 Andis Professional 04603 Outliner II Personal Trimmer]] or the [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>but it still have the same problem this razor is too sharp for anybody old or young</li>
      <li>These liners are not exactly what I expected, while the are great for regular line ups and edging they are not ideal for designs or other procedures that require pin point crispness, for that type of operation I would recommend the Andis T outliner.</li>

    <li> im a professional barber and i think the super liner is a great tool. real light weight, lots of power, surprisingly stornger than the andis t outliner, real easy to use, its a llitle loud,the new detachable blade too soon to know if that feature is very helpful but i like it.  compared to the t - outliner which i love i would say different, not better or worse. deff worth it i did not even have to adjust the blade it is very sharp right out the box.     sincerly, nas Da Barber  staten island whatup  [...]</li>
    <li> These liners are not exactly what I expected, while the are great for regular line ups and edging they are not ideal for designs or other procedures that require pin point crispness, for that type of operation I would recommend the Andis T outliner. These trimmers also require some adjusting they are not sharp enough right out of the box at least not for my prefrence, they do run very cool and quite and will cut even the thickest hair with ease, as you can see this product has both pros and cons just make sure you know what you will be using this device for before just blindly purchasing it</li>
    <li> The andis clippers are very well built to give you a close shaves. After adjusting the blades, I get the closest comparible to a straight razor cut, a electric can provide so far. The one issue I have is the rusted discoloration the blades have aquired after only a couple days of use.</li>
    <li> I loved using this trimmer the rotary motor works good to get through hair and the design lets you get very close when doing a bald fade. However, I have had some issues with the blade, including the third tooth in on the right side of the blade has broken off twice now in last 4 months. Also the blade&#x27;s teeth are very sharp and snag on skin when clean up the skin around the bottom of the beard. I would recommend the [[ASIN:B000RFS118 Andis Professional 04603 Outliner II Personal Trimmer]] or the [[ASIN:B000143C0K Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer]] over the super liner trimmer.</li>
    <li> My brother uses it a lot. My experience with it was great. It cuts very well. He just had to tweak the razor a bit in order for it to cut like it was designed, so it didn&#x27;t work right out of the box like the Youtube and other web videos portray it. I give it a 9 out of 10.</li>
    <li> The Andis SuperLiner is a nice trimer, however, it&#x27;s not as good as the Andis Outliner II! The look and feel of the Superliners are really nice. Actually they are better looking than any of the other trimers by Andis. They are light weight and thats a plus for those who cut for hours, but they feel as though they won&#x27;t have the longevity of the Outliner II by Andis. I have a pair of Outliner II trimmers that I have had since 1992 and they are still going strong! I would go with the Outliner II over the Superliners! The blades of the Superliner&#x27;s are sharp and cut well! I do like the way they cut. Overall, I would take another Superliner trimmer if given to me, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy another Superliner as long as the Outliners or T-Outliners are available. The Superliners are worth the money if you are a Pro and cut for hours at a time, because they are light weight, they run cooler and they are more ergonomic than any other trimer I&#x27;ve used. There are Pros and Cons to this and all products. It&#x27;s all a matter of opinion and preference. these trimmers do get the job done well! BTW!!! Amazon will help you get the best price!</li>
    <li> Nice liners, lightweight and has an attractive casing.  The only problem I have with these are that they do not cut as sharp as I like right out the box.  I switched the blades and now i am super satisfied. I recommend these liners for anyone looking for a lightweight all around trimmer for hair.  Tried using as a shaver, but it didn&#x27;t really do the job for me, but as liners they are excellent.</li>
    <li> Hi everybody it just recently purchase this product and use it for the first or second time it cut my brother and client head i did trying to adjust the blade but it still have the same problem this razor is too sharp for anybody old or young you will get cut it a terrible razor that i ever bought. i&#x27;m never going to use this razor ever again.  i strongly reccommed people please do not buy this product it will cut your client or love one.  I need a trimmer so i went to my local Sally store with return policy with 60 day and bought the wahl 5 star razor it did not give me any problem no cut and a nice crisp line up this what i recommed for everybody that what to buy a good trimmer</li>
    <li> These clippers are great once you get them adjusted. When you take them out the box they are not as sharp as I like them. I started to return them, but I just loosened  the blade adjusted it to where I wanted, and now there super sharp. Most trimmers that you get will need to be adjusted in order to get the best cut from them. So it&#x27;s not exclusive to these trimmers.     Now that I have these adjusted they are wonderful. Very light weight, blade stays cool, and rather quiet. Great addition to any trimmer line up.</li>
    <li> well first i must say that andis never disappointed its buyers when it came to the sharpness of its trimmers....the name says it all...these liner are crazy sharp....one to two passes is all it takes for a sharp crisp line.....i would definitely recommend these to any one who wants that steve harvey shape up....bump the blades back and they are good with kids also.....</li>
    <li> Point blank the Andis Superliner is the best trimmer out, but not because of its dynamic cutting ability. Any clipper can be adjusted perfectly but not every clipper can remained aligned for long periods of time because balance. With clippers like the T outliner the blade will sometimes waver up and down because of the fact that the screws holding the cutting blade in place are directly in the center as oppose to haveing a crew on both the left and right side of the blade which doesn&#x27;t allow any movement. With the T outliner and the wahl detailer the slightest thing such as improper packing or a drop can cause the blade to lose allignment but it doesn&#x27;t matter how you handle the Superliner. YOu won&#x27;t have to re adjust it the next day after. I rate this clipper a 4 out of 5 because of how difficult it is to allign. BUt when alligned perfectly this clipper is a dream tool for barbers. THis is a must buy.</li>
    <li> I have sworn by Andis clippers for a long time and will continue to however I was greatly disappointed in the Superliner.  First of all it does not posses the power of the Pro style Andis clippers.  And secondly, the materials appear to be cheaply manufactured.  I was disappointed however Andis has many other products that I live by and would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> This is a great unit, I shave my head about twice a week with this. I oil the blades and wipe it down before each use, I use a tooth brush to remove extra hair that accumulates during my shave. I really enjoy this shaver</li>
    <li> I had trouble justifying the price of this trimmer. It is more than twice the price of the drug store models. But the last three trimmers I bought died just after the warranty expired. As soon as I took the trimmer out of the box, I noticed the substantial heft and quality feel. It gives a very comfortable shave, especially if you want a trim close to your skin. The blade has fine teeth so you can be very precise around your beard or neckline. It does not pinch or pull your skin into the cutters. The blade is a little wider than consumer models. This helps me get more even trims on my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the trimmer plugs into a wall outlet it has a faster speed, more power and it does not run down while you are using it. The drug store trimmers just can not keep up with a professional unit like this one. I purchased the trimmer oil to prolong the blade life. It is a light oil with no petroleum order. FAIR WARNING: The combs Amazon offers as a package deal do not fit this trimmer. The seller knows this and will not accept returns.</li>
    <li> The outliner is a fantastic tool!  Most people &#x27;adjust&#x27; their outliner blades before use, so reviews that make a negative are really complaining about nothing.  Out of the box this tool is equivelent to every other liner I&#x27;ve used as they came out of their box.    This tool is remarkably easy to adjust, you don&#x27;t even have to remove the blade from the trimmer to do so!  As an added bonus, I carry two blades -- a factory set blade in addition to a \\&quot;hot\\&quot; blade so I can respond go what my client wants quickly and easily.    This tool is also very light compared to the classic \\&quot;T\\&quot; outliner.  The ease of adjustment, the ability to change baldes, the extremely powerful rotary motor, and reducing my need to carry two trimmers makes my toolkit a lighter and more powerful.  This tool is a worthy replacement for the classic outlier.      I just hope that Andis comes out with a \\&quot;tattoo\\&quot; and a square headed blade!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the andis superliner about three days ago because i was introduced by a friend of mine who owns a barber and beauty supply store. But before i bought the trimmer i first checked out the videos about the trimmer on Google. OMG!!!...i instantly fell in love with it and how crisp of a line it made and so i went out and bought it. Let me say that this trimmer is by far \\&quot;THE BEST TRIMMER\\&quot; ON THE MARKET TODAY\\&quot;...i don&#x27;t know have andis did it but this trimmer is so well built it dosen&#x27;t get hot at all and the blade attachment is sharp enough to make i line that is out of this world but dosen&#x27;t feel sharp to the patron, and shaving is effortless it just slides thru the beard like a razor...oh, i&#x27;m a barber by the way. So if there is anyone out there who has seen the andis superliner and is thinking about trying it, my advise to you is to go and get a pair because they are the REAL DEAL and perfect for all around cutting and shaving. My only question about the trimmer is will they make outliner 2 blade for this trimmer also...that way u can use 2 different blades for the same trimmer...Hmmmmm.[[ASIN:B0039OB0GC Andis Super Liner Trimmer]]</li>
    <li> I have used this trimmer twice so far and I wish it would&#x27;ve been 1st on my list before I bought the Andis Sonic.&lt;br /&gt;The Sonic is great to use along side of these if you want a bald fade and such. I&#x27;m using these as balders for my head and also to shave with w/o getting the ingrowns.&lt;br /&gt;These clippers stay cool and are set right out of the box.</li>
    <li> The clipper &#x27;s blade very bad, I don&#x27;t like at all. it wast my money.</li>
    <li> These clippers do this best by far... I have purchased other\\&quot;T\\&quot;outliners in the past but this one works out the best</li>
    <li> Well I must say I had very high expectations about this product so here&#x27;s my review .The super liner is supposed to cut every single hair but doesn&#x27;t it performs just like the other 1 except without getting hot so because of this reason I give it 4 stars I mean it means the world not to have your hand burning so I enjoy that feature but it&#x27;s okay ,just ok!!</li>
    <li> great deal love how this smooth cutting trimmer works and it&#x27;s a great travel tool another good buy would recommend to someone who are in the market for a new trimmer.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is light and is powerful. I had reservations after reading some of the reviews but i am very satisfied. professionals may want something more powerful but for cutting my own hair this is great. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a top of the line trimmer!  I purchased this with the Oster 76.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a high quality trimmer.</li>
