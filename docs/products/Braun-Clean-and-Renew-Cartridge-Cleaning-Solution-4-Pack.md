<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product. Helps keep your shaver clean.</li>
    <li> Everything looked OK with the cartridges and they worked just fine, but the labeling is in Chinese so I am not confident that these are actually Braun-approved cartridges.</li>
    <li> The Clean &amp; Renew Refills are very good it clean the Braun Shaver very well.</li>
    <li> If you have a Pulsonic razor these cleaning units are a must.  Much cheaper that going to a drug store to buy replacements and they work great.</li>
    <li> I use these things and they do  not last very long leaving them in the machine to evaporate. I learn to use them only when I need to clean the razor and close the refill up when done. I only clean the razor twice a week and it works fine.</li>
    <li> Only way to buy these affordable, six at a time. My stand/cleaner almost died, but it recovered after cleaning it thoroughly.</li>
    <li> Original exact product. Be careful who you buy from, there is plenty of false advertisement on these. There used to be 9 in a box. Haven&#x27;t found that anymore. These are also getting a little pricey.</li>
    <li> This was a good deal. I usually have to buy these all the time, but now I have enough for 6 months if not more.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price! Been using this type cleaner for my Braun Shaver for five years with no issues.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time, in fine condition and at the low price.  What else could you ask for?</li>
    <li> This is the third time I have purchased these refills from Amazon, and I have not found a better price any where. The Braun quality is good as always.</li>
    <li> These are great, except I wish that they didn&#x27;t have the lemon scent mixed in with the solution.  Lemon has citric acid, which can be corrosive over time (although only slightly).  Due to this, the original foil cover for my razor eventually started to corrode...although I had it (as well as the original cutter blade) on my razor for roughly 7 years, and the directions for the shaver say to replace them every 18 months...so I obviously can&#x27;t complain too much given how long they lasted regardless.  I did notice a significant difference once I replaced them, but that was to be expected.  Overall I have been pleased with these cleaning packs.</li>
    <li> My Braun 85xx has over 3300 uses. Bought the 6-pack bc I was tired of buying the 2-pack every few months. I assume the German-made shaver will still be working when I&#x27;m out of cleaner</li>
    <li> I love the automatic cleaning of the Braun shavers.  The only reason I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 was that the 6 pack came with one of the refills empty and the contents leaked all over the box.  Amazon was great and refunded me for 1/6th of the cost.</li>
    <li> Does the job, that I don&#x27;t do!  Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Best price and deal available</li>
    <li> This product extends the life of your shaver foil and shaver blades well beyond the recommended life. If you have trouble dishing out 40-50 bucks every six months for new foils and new blades then by all means buy the Clean and renew refills. Logically, I know I need a new foil and new set of blades. However, the foil and blades on the shaver are 2 plus years old going on 3. One of the major reasons they have lasted so long is the clean and renew refills.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun series five since they came out and before that, whatever Braun preceded it. The cleaning machine works very well if not perfectly. The cleaning solution itself works quite well, cleaning and lightly lubricating the foil and blades.</li>
    <li> Way cheaper than buying at target or BBB. works flawlessly.</li>
    <li> I clean my Braun electric razor every time I shave. Whether it needs it or not. Great product because arthritis limits my ability to clean an electric razor by hand.</li>
    <li> This product works fine. Many complain of the cost, but why complain when you purchased the shaver knowing you had to maintain it with a cleaning solution. We  are also trapped with buying low cost or free cell phones then get hit with high usage charges every month. It is part of the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; world of consumer entrapment. I have had the Braun razor for 7 years and it works great with using this cleaning solution.</li>
    <li> Product must have been ok, otherwise I would have given it 1 star. Great product, I think??Gave it a 5 anyways.</li>
    <li> Braun clean &amp; renew system really works ... I thought I would use it only every few days to save expense, but I surely do love how it makes my shaver feel new everytime ... it really makes a difference!</li>
    <li> OEM replacement. Good price for an item hard to find locally.</li>
    <li> These refills keep my shaver clean and lubricated. I could really tell the difference when I ran out of fluid and was waiting for the refills (you have to pay attention to the fluid level).</li>
    <li> Kindle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes time for me to learn how to fully use the Kindle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A support group in my Vancouver WA would be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also can I adjust letter size from what I chose at set up?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Donner</li>
    <li> good price/ quanity. I usually buy that aclean &amp; Renew packs at Drug Store, in a 3 pack. It is a better buy to buy in the 6 Pack.</li>
    <li> Genuine, perfect, fast shipping! A+</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a reasonable price for my shaver. I would recommend and will continue to purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> Great deal for Braun refills.</li>
    <li> Does a great job cleaning my Braun Razor. Can&#x27;t find any better. Its also easy to use, just slips in the cleaner. No problem</li>
    <li> Braun Syncro Shaver Clean &amp; Renew Does a Wonderful Job.  The shaver is always clean and ready for the next use thanks to this product.</li>
    <li> These work well but are pretty much a rip-off by Braun in the same way that printer ink is a rip-off.  It is 50 cents worth of rubbing alcohol and a lubricant in a plastic container with a cheap filter.  Less than a dollar to manufacture.  And it costs you $6 each.  Then they color it blue so you can&#x27;t refill it yourself with clear alcohol because they have some sort of sensor in the chargin/cleaning unit.  However, I discovered that, if you put some blue food coloring in rubbing alcohol, you can top the unit off when it gets low (primarily through evaporation).  You could completely replace the fluid after rinsing out the filter if you could get the right lubricant to mix with the alcohol.  Anyway, that&#x27;s a lot of trouble so I buy replacements from Amazon--but not as often as I would have to if I didn&#x27;t have a bottle of alcohol handy with some food coloring in it.</li>
    <li> This product achieves all that one could desire in a cleaning liquid.&lt;br /&gt;It accomplishes what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Never fails me, I have tried other products and time and time again have come back to this tried and true way to clean my shaver.  Don&#x27;t waist your time or money on other products this is by far the best on the market for this shaver.</li>
    <li> Nothing to write, just works and cleans my shaver.  Been buying these refills and will do so in the future.</li>
    <li> I rinse the razor in hot water first so as not to dirty the solution sooner. Lubricant makes the razor glide over my skin.</li>
    <li> Buying these cleaner refills always annoys me. At least now I only have to be annoyed once every 6 months.</li>
    <li> I use these, about 4 a year, as I use my electric razor to augment my straight razor shaving.  This fluid and the cleaner/charger work well.</li>
    <li> This is a very good price for the cleaner cartridges. Also, it was nice to get them quickly as I was out. I&#x27;ve been using a Braun &amp; these cartridges for about 10 years &amp; for me, it&#x27;s the best system I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> These refills worked great in my Braun shaver and the fit was perfect They came well packed and on time. Works great and would buy again once I need more refills.</li>
    <li> I have ordered these refills numerous times. Great buy and quality. I will recommend this product for the Braun Shaver.</li>
    <li> Great price for these refills. I purchase them often to keep my shaver like new. Better prices online, even with the shipping, than purchasing in the store.</li>
    <li> Both my son and I have Braun shavers so buying in bulk was a good choice.  Best price I could find.</li>
    <li> Works to auto clean Braun Razor!</li>
    <li> The least expensive way to buy these for my self-cleaning Braun shaver system.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be very useful for my razor.  It does as it&#x27;s supposed to, cleans the razor and lubricates it.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> thank you great prices,</li>
    <li> I needed these for the Braun razor system I recently purchased.&lt;br /&gt;I like the cleaning results and it is less expensive to buy the six pack.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the continuing cost. There should be a way to make up a jug of the fluid but I haven&#x27;t taken the time to do that...yet.</li>
    <li> I love having a fresh and clean shaver each morning. These days I&#x27;m using a standard razor more than my electric but it&#x27;s nice to have that fresh fruit-loop smelling electric shaver every time I need it.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun for  years and found it to be an excellent product. Would recommend it  to all.&lt;br /&gt;Murray</li>
    <li> If you have a Braun Shaver that cleans itself then these are for you.  They do a great job highly recommend  them.</li>
    <li> Hate spending money on something that evaporates so quickly.</li>
    <li> Product does a great job keeping razor clean and fresh. Product was shipped and delivered as promised.  At first purchase of razor I thought I could refill them myself.  After replacing the first cartridge and seeing all of the dirt and razor stubble in the bottom of the reservoir.. I knew that would not be a good (clean) idea.  So happy I am staying with the original cleaner.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. There are cheaper imitations available out there but are filled with drawbacks. Stick with the original replacement and you will have no problems.</li>
    <li> Not a must have but a real nice way to clean. Makes the shave glide and leaves a nice scent aswell.</li>
    <li> Quick and Correct from Amazon. Good source for these shaver cleaning refills.  I have been using these for a couple of years.</li>
    <li> The product is as advertised and as far as I can tell are the original manufactures product.  They work great.</li>
    <li> My husband uses these in his shaver. Good product, price is right, and delivery is fast.</li>
    <li> Great for my shaver, if you have the shaver you have to have these to clean the blades</li>
    <li> Our shaver store disappeared so where else, look on Amazon and sure enough there we found our much needed cleaner kits.. so we are pleased to have a good supply on hand and will return to Amazon for the next batch too.</li>
    <li> brand new and exactly what it said it would be. We love Amazon and love ordering from them as we are always confident in what we are getting</li>
    <li> Great value. I purchased this for a fraction of the cost at my local store and saved me a trip</li>
    <li> Not really an option.  But it seems to work the way it is supposed to. I&#x27;ll keep buying it out of necessity.</li>
    <li> Always pleased with this product and service.</li>
    <li> When you want the best... you go to Braun.</li>
    <li> Received in 3 days. Good price.</li>
    <li> cheap and cleans my razor.</li>
    <li> I received the Clean &amp; Renew refills 6-pack on time, but they were just a bunch of unpacked singles thrown into a cardboard box.  They must have run out of a true 6-pack and substituted the singles.  They work.  That is what matters.</li>
    <li> What ever is in this product it sure does a good job cleaning the shaver.  The liquid makes this shaver better, in my eyes.</li>
    <li> The refills were Ok but the way how the ship it was not so good, on eof them appeared broken.</li>
    <li> Braun Syncro Shaver Clean &amp; Renew Refills 6 Pack super fast shipment nice packaging product came as described highly recommended</li>
    <li> Good price for this quantity</li>
    <li> Standard product, much cheaper than elsewhere</li>
    <li> We ordered these before and the quality of this product is always excellent.  The packaging has always been intact and will keep my shaver in good working condition.</li>
    <li> product works as advertised, good fit and needed to keep heads clean.  Razor works really well and gives clean shave</li>
    <li> Curiously, this product is hard to write a review for. It&#x27;s a one-trick pony; one opens the refill, pops it in the shaver charger-cleaner, closes it and it cleans the shaver head. It&#x27;s simple, it works.</li>
    <li> Keeps my shaver running like new!</li>
    <li> A must for the clean and charge.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and was happ to find it at a great price. Thank you...</li>
    <li> Use all the time. Hard to find locally and if do very pricey!  Great value buying this way. will last for awhile.</li>
    <li> Good value, and for the right price! And these last quite a while too...I would purchase them again!  Thank you</li>
    <li> I usually try and clean my shaver every 5-7 days. Helps for a closer cleaner shave. Don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s necessary to clean every day or so.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy and cheaper to stock up as these things get used up in less that 2 months with daily use.</li>
    <li> They are a bit expensive to use but it leaves your Braun always feeling clean and fresh for its next use.</li>
    <li> keep it clean keep it sharp</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, and product as advertised.</li>
    <li> These refills are important for your Braun shaver. I changed mine at the prescribed time as was amazed at the condition of the fluid in the old cartridge. These cartridges are factory original and you need them to preserve your shaver.</li>
    <li> Good price, keeps my braun shaver as new</li>
    <li> Excellant!&lt;br /&gt;Good product perates as advertised.Delivery good.&lt;br /&gt;Humidifier has been running for 1 month, and has kept&lt;br /&gt;humiity level as requested</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Seller is AA</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m thrilled to have found received it. It was on time, cost effective and easy to replace the old one with.</li>
    <li> An item like this should have an &#x27;automatic order&#x27; option because its something you just don&#x27;t think about but needs to be changed frequently with daily use.</li>
    <li> I have tried to use several other ideas to clean my razor, but  I always have to come back to this braun cleaner to keep my razor cutting smooth, and operating correctly.</li>
    <li> The Braun shaver with the cleaner option works very well.  You just have to remember an electric shaver will not shave as close as a razor.</li>
    <li> Great product....too expensive!  The ease of installing and removing these refills is appreciated, and the solution keeps my shaver head clean.  My only complaint is that the refills are overly expensive , and these are the only refill products available for the Braun Series 7 shaver.  Alas, this is not unusual for high end products.</li>
    <li> My satrisfaction has been 100%</li>
    <li> the six pack works very well and have used it before on old shave that had the same type of cleaning</li>
    <li> easy to use...last longer than I expected...good deal</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price!!!</li>
    <li> I buy them for my son as a gift if not he won&#x27;t buy them and the razor he has was his Grandfathers who is no longer with us and the razor is like have a small part of him around he loved new gadgets and was really proud of this one</li>
    <li> simply a good price for a product I use</li>
    <li> This product is the one to use to routinely clean your Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and price was right</li>
    <li> The convenience of ordering this product online makes having the shaver. Just open the box, remove the used cartridge and insert the new one.</li>
    <li> CLEANS GREAT SAME STUFF AS WHEN I BOUGHT IT NEW  IT DOES A GREAT JOB CLEANING BRAUN 7000 ELECTRIC RAZOR</li>
    <li> This system for keeping your razor clean is the best.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a Braun with this system for about 7 years</li>
    <li> Exactly as described!!!! As you read the product info, you always wonder if products like this are what they describe them as.  This one is.</li>
    <li> As expected and a good price</li>
    <li> works well, just that the liquid evaporates faster than you can use it.  I&#x27;m trying to keep the cap and recapping after every use.</li>
    <li> This the same product that I used to purchase in stores but I found that I can save money and get a much better value by buying six or more on Amazon. I have been buying all my refills here for the past three years.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT MY HUSBAND  A NEW SHAVER WHICH HE LOVES AND ORDERED THESE SO HE WOULDN&#x27;T RUN OUT.  THEY ARE SO SIMPLE TO INSTALL AND CAME WELL PACKAGED</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always tried different electric shavers before and always fell back to the razor. This is the first system that does almost as good of a job, reliably.</li>
    <li> The razor is the best electric shaver I have ever used over more than 40 years of trying different brands. I it is a smooth and complete shave. The only problem is how frequently i need to replace the cleaning solution. However, that is easy to do.</li>
    <li> The cleaning solution is the same as what you can buy in Walmart or Walgeens. The difference is the price! The 6 cleaning refills were about $6.oo each through Amazon and in the past I was paying about $12.00 each at Walmart and Walgreens. What a deal. They were free shipping as well.</li>
    <li> These refills are very affordable and come in multi packs to save me time.  You can find them at some pharmacies but in smaller quantities and not as good a price.  They only appear to make one kind of refill so you are not going to have to worry about getting exactly the right one like for the shaver parts.</li>
    <li> Great for the money, I am very pleased with this product and will continue to by more of them.</li>
    <li> I hate picking up these things in tiny packages of two when I know I&#x27;ll need to replace them roughly once a month. This package of 6 was the idea solution...I ordered two packages, and now I won&#x27;t have to reorder for a year.</li>
