      <li>Don&#x27;t expect miracles overnight, but if you are consistent you will see results.</li>
      <li>I would imagine that using it on regular older scars would reduce them even more, and perhaps with newer scars they may even become &amp;#34;invisible.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I found that this product made it easier to massage my scars from my recent surgery, and it came recommended to me by more than one person, so have high hopes for its use.  </li>

      <li>It can be used on old or new sacrs (as long as new scar is properly healed); you must use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> so far so good after 4 wks scars are lighter</li>
    <li> I am using this product to heal a wound left from a knife cut.  It works slowly but surely.  Don&#x27;t expect miracles overnight, but if you are consistent you will see results.</li>
    <li> Great price! Recommended by my surgeon and it really works!</li>
    <li> Everything was fine,  Thank you.</li>
    <li> a great product , I will order again</li>
    <li> Great product, great price</li>
    <li> I tripped when I was younger and had a huge cut on my forehead, totally noticeable. I used Mederma and the scar basically disappeared. The Mederma I used was for kids, but I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s the same ingredients, the kid&#x27;s one was just purple and smelled like grape. This is definitely a good product as long as you use it correctly. My doctor told me 2 times daily, and I figure it can&#x27;t hurt so I&#x27;ll try it 2 times a day this time.</li>
    <li> It has helped me to fade some of my scars.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about 3 weeks on an surgical scar that is a little over a year old. I only have to use this formula once a day. When I dry off after my shower dead skin cells roll off the scar and it is getting softer and lighter. I expect Mederma will make a big difference after continued use.</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful product. I am already seeing a difference , the surgical scar is getting lighter every day !!</li>
    <li> I have used this product on two occasions both with very dissapointing results. I even spoke to my doctor about it who said that the product is a waste of money.  She recommended ScarAway Silicone Sheaths which I have been using in combination with ScarAway Gel and this has definitely made a difference.  ScarAway is a lot cheaper too, in addition to being 100% more effective. It can be used on old or new sacrs (as long as new scar is properly healed); you must use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that I am a brown skinned person of colour and to be fair maybe this product wasn&#x27;t created for my skin type. It was a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> have yet to see any results</li>
    <li> The product seam to be working properly,but take more to disappear the scar as stated in the directions.</li>
    <li> I recommend it. It works  good for your scar.</li>
    <li> This is a product which continues to work for my husband who did surgery 2 years ago and is still dealing with some scarring. He&#x27;ll continue using.</li>
    <li> This is the best.  Don&#x27;t use other version.  Original version is the best.</li>
    <li> Amazing, I&#x27;d like to receive an offer on more than one pack to buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this gel on my raised scars for several years and parts of my scars have flattened.  I would imagine that using it on regular older scars would reduce them even more, and perhaps with newer scars they may even become &amp;#34;invisible.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I found that this product made it easier to massage my scars from my recent surgery, and it came recommended to me by more than one person, so have high hopes for its use.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a great improvement in the scars and my skin has changed its tone favorably. I think it is a very good cream if you take into consideration that the results are actually seen after using it a year or so.</li>
    <li> Expensive but very good. Not just for scars, but for wrinkles also.</li>
    <li> It did a minimal removal of old scars</li>
    <li> Mederma scar cream has been very beneficial in reducing the size and appearance of my surgical scars. I have used this product for years after learning about it during my occupational therapy sessions following hand surgery. Since then, I have been using it whenever I need to reduce any scar tissue caused by any source.</li>
