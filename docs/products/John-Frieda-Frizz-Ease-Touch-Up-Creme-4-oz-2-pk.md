<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is a must-have for my curly and otherwise frizzy-fluffy hair. I use it on dry hair every day and it makes my curls look nice and less &amp;#34;wild&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Love it! Controls the little frizzies on top!</li>
    <li> I allow my 3B curly hair to air dry and the styling product I use (Curl Keeper by Frizz Off) dries just slightly crunchy.  So I rub a dab of this between my palms and run it through my hair to soften the crunchies and set my style.  I can also use it on dry hair to refresh my curls a bit.  I used to use the Fekkai styling creme at about 4 times the cost; this is a great, economical substitute.  As other reviewers have stated, you only need to use a small dab so the tube lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I always use this product for the freeze in my hair, and is very convenient they will bring it to my door!!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It helps with Frizz and my hair does not look sticky or wet.  I get a nice style every time I use it.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is seriously a miracle worker (at least for my hair). I use it to fix parts that aren&#x27;t doing what I want them to do. Works on straight and curly hair. Please note that you MUST follow the directions and use it on fully DRY hair.</li>
    <li> I have coarse, wiry hair.  Each hair has a mind of its own.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product to smooth the hair without destroying its body.  The hair is smoother but neither sticky nor stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People with frizzy or strong-willed hair like mine would benefit from using this after washing and a little dab every day for maintenance.</li>
    <li> This product is great for hair that gets frizzy or to tame it after washing.  I even have a tube that I keep in my suitcase.</li>
    <li> The product is great. But I only received one product. I did not receive both. Horrible!</li>
    <li> I found this product by accident it was left in the restroom of where I worked as a seasonal holiday employee. I tried it  and have continued to purchase it ever since.  It works quite well, it is not sticky or heavy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product everywhere from Guam to Afghanistan and its a lifesaver for the strict hair regulations we have in the military. Smells good always, was a very good deal for a package of 2.</li>

    <li> I have been using this product for years.  Really helps to define curls and lessen the frizz from NJ summer days.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy and wavy hair. It is always twice as bad when you go to humid places. This product is my trusted quick fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let my hair air dry almost 80%, blow dry it, then apply this as my finishing product. It&#x27;s given me great results through and through!</li>
    <li> I have dry, thick, frizzy hair, not quite curly but wild nonetheless. Add my graying, aging hair and it&#x27;s a mess pretty much all the time, especially when it is freshly cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this up and expected to add it to the pile of other smoothing agents that didn&#x27;t work, but keeps my hair smooth and soft without a lot of effort on my part. It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything really, and I don&#x27;t have to use much. I used to use a wax to smooth it out but it leaves my hair heavy and sticky.

    <li> Great product, I put it in my hair every day to keep it soft and frizz free.</li>
    <li> Great product. Tames frizz and fly aways, while adding shine.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect if you have thick wavy hair that enjoys getting frizzy.  I have used it for a number of years now after trying many other products.  It keeps my wavy curls together better so they don&#x27;t frizz.  One trick to using this product is to wait for your hair to get partially dry before using the product.  If your hair is wet, I find the product to be much less effective.  I am not sure why, but this is what I have found.  The product does dry completely so my hair does not look like it has product on it -- it just looks like my hair is smooth and wavy.  You will likely have to experiment with how much to use.  If you use too little, it doesn&#x27;t work, and if you use too much it looks like you have used a greasy product on your hair. It is a must have.  I just wish they made travel size containers because it is one ounce over the carry-on size limit for air travel.</li>
    <li> I use this product to detangle my dry hair in the morning any time I don&#x27;t want to wash it just yet. I have permed and colored hair for years. It makes my hair feel soft and natural to the touch. I pair it with John Frieda Frizz Ease Dream Curls Spray after that, in order to keep my curls in tact and under control. Love  this brand.</li>
    <li> Stuff does literally nothing. I have shoulder length curly frizzy hair, and applying this even in varying situations always results in messier than before outcomes. I will probably trash this stuff.</li>
