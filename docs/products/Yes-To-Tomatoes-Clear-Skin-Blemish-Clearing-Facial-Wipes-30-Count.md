      <li>However, this one is OKAY.  </li>
      <li>I usually love most of &amp;#34;Yes to&amp;#34; product lines.  </li>
      <li>Love these.</li>
      <li>, glad I got them~</li>
      <li>I love these wipes but they seem to come inconsistent</li>
      <li>It took 2 1/2 towelettes to get everything off, and all that happened was my face broke out even more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not saying this contains some magically formula to stop all blemishes.  </li>
      <li>this is an OK product.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love these wipes.</li>
      <li>I feel like I might be better off going to bed without cleansing at all rather than using these.</li>
      <li>I love, love this.  </li>
      <li>They smell so good and leave my face feeling fresh.</li>
      <li>So these towelettes may work better for those who have a skin pH</li>
      <li>My son and daughter love them</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of acne, so this is perfect to keep my skin clean and clear.</li>
      <li>but when they come good ..they are very cleansing and soothing!</li>
      <li>One positive is the wipes are a good size and you can easily wipe all of your face with it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d wipe my face and have the cloth completely covered in makeup, which is great..</li>
      <li>So my advice is to not mess with a routine that&#x27;s working great already.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re super gentle but very effective.</li>
      <li>These work great for refreshing your face after a workout, especially with acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and stays moist in package between uses.</li>
      <li>These make evening face-cleaning easy</li>
      <li>It is perfect for an active teenager.  </li>
      <li>Wipes are strong and hold up to vigorous cleansing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, there is often a strong perfume smell and can be a soapy residue.  </li>
      <li>and there... don&#x27;t need something this strong</li>
      <li>; This couldn&#x27;t have been more true.</li>
      <li>Not my favorite, but not bad either.</li>
      <li>Super easy to use and doesn&#x27;t break me out the way most wipes do</li>
      <li>These are fine</li>
      <li>The product itself seems to be fine.  </li>
      <li>I was super hopeful these would work!</li>
      <li>I also use the Yes To Tomatoes moisturizer, which keeps my skin constantly smooth.</li>
      <li>These worked great for my teenage daughter for her acne.</li>
      <li>So happy to have finally found a skin care routine that works for me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bonus point for cruelty free.  </li>
      <li>I like all the good natural skin enriching/healing ingredients in the wipes.  </li>
      <li>Good for substitute face washing on sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>These wipes are so super easy to use.  </li>
      <li>They also didn&#x27;t remove all my makeup, which I guess is understandable as these seem to focus more on blemish control, but I don&#x27;t wear very much at all.</li>
      <li>I was a bit worried because they were so pricy, but they&#x27;re totally worth it!</li>
      <li>These types of towelettes never clean all the make up off my face, but they all do a great job of getting most off.</li>
      <li>My skin feels clean and balanced.</li>
      <li>I love this product and I buy it every month because it is safe on sensitive skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are the best things in the world! I think I just found the holy grail for anti-acne... and it&#x27;s facial wipes of all things!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter is 10 and began breaking out.  I wanted something more natural and found Yes to Tomatoes...it&#x27;s easy for her to use and her breakouts have stopped!!!  Thanks Yes to Tomatoes!</li>
    <li> I love the whole Yes To Tomatoes line. It&#x27;s great for acne-prone skin. But I hate that they changed the packaging on this product. These used to come in a smaller, round containers with small round wipes, perfect for one cleansing. But now the wipes are enormous sheets like baby wipes, and it&#x27;s a complete waste. So, basically you are paying for much less than before. I won&#x27;t be buying more of these unless the round containers come back.</li>
    <li> They do nothing for me</li>
    <li> Deceptive marketing strategies, disappointments, and a whole lot of nothing! One star is too many here! Your hard earned money needs to be spent on something that works!</li>
    <li> A little harsh on the skin prefer yes to blueberries</li>
    <li> The product itself seems to be fine.  Removes waterproof mascara and no distinctive smell.  The product was properly packed but appeared to be packed already broken.  The white lid over the opening was broken and loose in the box.  I tried to snap it back on but it wouldn&#x27;t.  I was disappointed to receive something in that condition but hopefully I can place the whole pack in a ziplock bag and use them up before they dry out.  Very annoying.</li>
    <li> These have been my go-to facial wipes for quite some time. Normally I use cleansing milk to remove makeup and cleanse. I follow with diluted apple cider vinegar as a toner and argan oil as a moisturizer. I&#x27;m usually a stickler for my skin routine because it works so well... but these are wonderful for those lazy nights when I just want to get to bed as soon as possible. They&#x27;re super gentle but very effective. One of the few products that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I highly recommend</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for these, since I&#x27;ve heard such good things about the Yes To line. Unfortunately, these were kind of a let down. I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable improvement in my skin, (combination + acne-prone) and the only thing I DID notice was how greasy these made my face.  It was weird, because when I actually touched my face, it didn&#x27;t necessarily feel oily, but looking at it, it looked like an oil slick.  They also didn&#x27;t remove all my makeup, which I guess is understandable as these seem to focus more on blemish control, but I don&#x27;t wear very much at all. They also burned the hell out of my eyes.</li>
    <li> No miracles, but works well. I&#x27;d say it seems probably to be helping my acne a little when I use every night (though I&#x27;m trying a few other things, too, so hard to say for sure—my acne has been more under control, though), and I love the smell! They&#x27;ve stayed plenty moist, which is nice.</li>
    <li> These are fine I guess. I wanted a salicylic cleansing cloth for when I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my face, but these leave a sticky residue on my skin. I haven&#x27;t even finished the package because I only use them when I&#x27;m desperate - I hate having a sticky face.</li>
    <li> I use this as a regular face cleaner for when I feel my face it dirty or sweaty form a workout. I have sensitive skin that sometimes breaks out. So far it hasn&#x27;t agitated my skin and love that it helps acne while cleaning my face on the go.</li>
    <li> Love the smell!! Please add back to subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> I have PCOS and some acne issues as a result of this. I use these wipes along with Clearasil ultra acne treatment cream, and my skin is the best it&#x27;s ever been. So happy to have finally found a skin care routine that works for me.</li>
    <li> I love these wipes! The only other time my skin has been this clear is when I had a prescription. I didn&#x27;t even have my monthly menstruation pimple. These are the best. I am now getting them on a monthly subscription basis. I will use these wipes forever now.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love these, but they&#x27;ve made my skin worse and have brought in more breakouts. :/</li>
    <li> I have bad adult acne on my chin. I tried Yes To Tomatoes and it really did help clean it up probably better than any other product I had tried up to that point! Believe me when I say I&#x27;ve tried about EVERYTHING!!&lt;br /&gt;I eventually went to my Derm and she has me on some prescription meds now, so I stopped using these.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 5 stars bc I would say if you need something for your acne and don&#x27;t want to go the dermatologist, this will help. It won&#x27;t fix it, but it&#x27;ll help control breakouts better. I used to use this and then the AM/PM CeraVe. My Derm still has me using the CeraVe, but I had to stop everything else due to the other meds I&#x27;m on now.</li>
    <li> These wipes are so super easy to use.  My son and daughter love them b/c it takes just a few seconds to cleanse their face and does a great job controlling acne breakouts.</li>
    <li> This is a good product but when it arrived, mine were dried out. Good for substitute face washing on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love the product! used my 6th pack. still have back ups, and still ordering more!</li>
    <li> These worked well. Not my favorite, but not bad either. I think I may try them again and I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about them, but I don&#x27;t have anything great to say about them either. I like that they are natural.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been testing this product out and I feel that it works. my skin feels smoother and has less acne but the odor of the product is disgusting to me but for the sake of having better skin I can deal with it. so I will repurchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I buy it every month because it is safe on sensitive skin.  It leaves your face with a fresh feeling.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These worked great for my teenage daughter for her acne.</li>
    <li> Takes my make up off no problems. Very easy to grab and use. The scent isn&#x27;t too tomatoe-y. Didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it is a little sudsier than I wanted. I will buy this product again and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> It cleans well enough, but I just cannot stand the smell that it leaves behind on my face.  If you don&#x27;t mind the smell, go for it.</li>
    <li> I bought these for those nights when I&#x27;m too exhausted to move let alone go through my three step skin routine. I feel like I might be better off going to bed without cleansing at all rather than using these. They instantly break me out. They smell lovely, but are not a good match for my skin.</li>
    <li> They smell so good and leave my face feeling fresh. I was a bit worried because they were so pricy, but they&#x27;re totally worth it!</li>
    <li> these wipes are the best thing ever for acne. they remove dirt and oil and clear up acne really well. would recommend buying these</li>
    <li> I bought these because I have used the Yes to Blueberries wipes and love them also, so figured I would give these a try since I have mild to moderate breakouts. I have been using Yes to Tomatoes wipes for three days and so far I have noticed a nice difference in the clarity of my skin, there are no new breakouts forming, my face is really starting to clear up and improve because of these awesome wipes and I also noticed the gentleness of the product, they do not strip your skin&#x27;s natural moisture, which I love about the yes to line. I have been alternating using the yes to blueberries with the tomatoes wipes depending on the time of day and the level of oiliness of my skin. Sometimes I wash my face with olive oil soap before using the wipes. I am also trying the yes to tomatoes mask for a spot treatment in conjunction with the wipes, just got a one time sample pack to use for spot treatments. I will be buying these wipes again though, so far the best blemish clearing wipes I&#x27;ve tried, I definitely recommend them if you are looking for something to keep by your nightstand on the nights you get lazy and don&#x27;t want to go through all the washing, toning, and moisturizing steps, these are a great quickie to substitute to just wipe the day off your face before you fall asleep and prevent breakouts and you get cleansing, toning, and moisturizing benefits in one step, love it.</li>
    <li> I love these tomato wipes the best compared to the cucumber and blueberry. I like the smell myself - I have been using them for a couple of years and use them every night before bed. They keep my face clear and feels good right before bed. I&#x27;m 34 and still have super oily skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not saying this contains some magically formula to stop all blemishes.  These face wipes are great and feel fresh.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like you are wiping your face with a cloth full of chemicals like other brands.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use on an extended camping/backpacking trip during which I would have very limited access to fresh water.  As it happened, I was in the midst of a particularly nasty hormonal breakout, and the usual cysts were forming.  To my amazement, my skin immediately started to improve with the use of these wipes and, within 5 days, my skin had completely cleared up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know exactly which ingredients in these wipes are working, but they have trumped 2 decades of unsuccessful dermatologist visits, medical-grade treatment products, and the like.  Needless to say, I will be continuing to use these and recommending them highly, though I realize what works for some will certainly not always work for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always avoided wipes due to environmental concerns, but the biodegradability of this item makes it a big win all around for me and the planet.  If you have been suffering from stubborn acne as well, you should at least give this item a try for a good month or so, especially at this price point.</li>
    <li> I usually love most of &amp;#34;Yes to&amp;#34; product lines.  However, this one is OKAY.  I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again.  I like all the good natural skin enriching/healing ingredients in the wipes.  However, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in the blemish clearing.  I got them for my back as I have blemishes on my back from back acne.  However, I didn&#x27;t use them consistently.  Which is why I won&#x27;t give the towelettes a bad rating, as the ingredients are good natural ingredients that should heal blemishes if the wipes are used consistently.  I just didn&#x27;t use them consistently.  I usually can tell what products works really well for me, even without consistent use.  It&#x27;s nice that they are medicated towelettes as well.  However the pH of my skin does not respond to Salicylic Acid of any percentage (the towelettes has 1%).  My skin actually responds well to Benzoyl Peroxide as the active ingredient for acne/acne prevention.  So these towelettes may work better for those who have a skin pH that responds to medicated beauty products that have Salicylic Acid as it&#x27;s active ingredient.</li>
    <li> Love these wipes im addicted!&lt;br /&gt;Best for lazy nights&lt;br /&gt;Feels nice and smooth and big enough for any big ole face</li>
    <li> These face wipes are good for cleaning as well as fighting blemishes and black heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there is often a strong perfume smell and can be a soapy residue.  This does tend to dry fairly quickly and does not lead to dryness or cracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are probably best used at night.</li>
    <li> If you wipe too quickly with repeated usage, it can create a burning sensation. I personally do not mind the smell and I think that these wipes are great for wiping away excess oils.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m lazy sometimes. I keep these wipes on my nightstand on the nights where I try to go to sleep without washing my face.</li>
    <li> Got these for my 13 years old grandson who is just starting to get a few bumps. He wouldn&#x27;t use other face products but likes these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same package of wipes for almost a month now. The reason why they&#x27;ve kept so long is because I use one &#x27;towelette&#x27; each day. I cut one in three pieces and put it in a plastic bag and drain out the air so that it keeps it wet until I&#x27;m ready to use it. I usually wash my face three times a day: Once in the morning, once in the noon, and once before I go to sleep. I tried an acne scrub before this, but after a week or so I got tired of using it and it was drying out my face. These wipes are low maintenance and seem to keep my face moisturized. I don&#x27;t have as many blemishes now and the only thing left behind are scars. I will continue to use these until my skin is completely clear.  A face scrub CAN help, but you shouldn&#x27;t do it everyday. Otherwise your face will dry out like mine. With these you can use them any time you think your face needs cleaned.  One star down because it seems to make my face shiny (but if you wear make-up or use only at night this shouldn&#x27;t matter) and it isn&#x27;t 100% natural. I don&#x27;t think these require perfume.</li>
    <li> These work great for refreshing your face after a workout, especially with acne prone skin. However, they don&#x27;t really erase any acne, just prevent it from getting worse.</li>
    <li> These little things are my favorite! I have tried a lot of different make-up remover wipes, but these work really well for morning and night. They remove make-up really well and really do prevent and treat breakouts. I was having a lot of trouble with breakouts and clogged pores and these have really done wonders.</li>
    <li> Smells a little funny, but what do you expect from tomatoes. Works great work acne.</li>
    <li> These did not work for me at all</li>
    <li> great scent. Works great. I use this after my workouts as a quick face wipe down/wash. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> completely dries and irritates my face, but it is for acne so may be good for those with bad acne. I just have a couple bumps here and there... don&#x27;t need something this strong</li>
    <li> I use these after I wash my face at night and it feels especially dry/tight. The moisture in these I would describe as &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; and the salicyclic acid I would describe as medium. I don&#x27;t mind the smell, it&#x27;s kind of a babyish soft smell (not overpowering and only lasts til your face dries). I would recommend these for people who have acne that is superficial (no cystic breakouts)</li>
    <li> I use these at home, too but I really like then when I travel.  Also good for cleaning off of the face after a work out</li>
    <li> At first it was OK, with subsequent uses my face started reacting to it, turning bright angry red, with a burning/itching sensation.  I have sensitive skin, but I don&#x27;t have this problem with similar Burts Bees products so I thought it&#x27;d be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus point for cruelty free.  Maybe if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, this will be a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband used them and didn&#x27;t seem to find a reduction in blemishes as promised.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my eye surgery because I couldn&#x27;t get my face wet so this was perfect. I love this brand because I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t make my skin peel.</li>
    <li> These did make my face feel clean and they did a good job of clearing up my face.</li>
    <li> I love these for in the morning and before bed. I don&#x27;t wear much make-up if any, and these are perfect for doing a quick once-over.</li>
    <li> My brother had horrible acne and I got these to him since other products with harsher chemicals, alcohol, etc have only made his skin worse because they irritate it. These, however, he will swear by. Even in just a couple of days using it 1-2 times per day things started to clear up. He loves these, glad I got them~</li>
    <li> Bought these to take backpacking as I have pretty s***ty skin and need to keep my face clean. Worked well and didn&#x27;t cause any iritation or cause me to breakout.</li>
    <li> These cleaned my face fine, and were gentle enough for my skin (though I didn&#x27;t risk trying my eye area), but it didn&#x27;t help my acne at all. I may just have stronger acne than this could handle, or this may work better on someone with more oily skin (I&#x27;m dry with acne).</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Super easy to use and doesn&#x27;t break me out the way most wipes do</li>
    <li> these were my faves, but amazon stopped offering as subscribe and save. sheets can be torn in half or thirds, don&#x27;t smell and not irritating.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands of facial wipes, and these are my absolute favorite (boots quick thinking wipes are second). These completely remove my makeup --including mascara -- and any grime or oil, and they don&#x27;t leave any residue on my skin. They prevent me from breaking out (which normally happens when I use a wipe at night instead of washing my face, but doesn&#x27;t with these). The \\&quot;blemish clearing\\&quot; aspect is a small amount of salicylic acid (1%) as well as a bit of witch hazel. I have combination skin that dries &amp; flakes easily when overexfoliated or not cared for properly, and these are just as gentle as can be on it. Love them!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these wipes. They smell great and I don&#x27;t break out as much anymore. I have been using them for about 6 months and I wont use anything else. Definitely worth giving them a try if you have some breakouts.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using them for a month or so and they&#x27;re dry and useless. big let down, I&#x27;m fairly fond of the brand. would highly recommend any other product by them. yes to cucumbers face towelettes are way better if you&#x27;re looking for something else, for dry or acne prone skin. you can really feel the difference.</li>
    <li> We got these for our son who, sadly, inherited my problem skin. These make evening face-cleaning easy and they REALLY work. Price matches what we paid locally at Walgreens.</li>
    <li> I like to use the wipes for traveling, sometimes before bed, in the middle of the day. Any time where going to a sick and washing is not convenient.</li>
    <li> This product broke my 15 year old niece out.</li>
    <li> this is an OK product. I think it actually broke me out so I will not be using it to clean my face anymore. I will probably just keep them to avoid the hassle of mailing back . It may work for someone that is not sensitive to it.</li>
    <li> Cleans my eye and face makeup off well. Leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. Leaves no odor or residue. Easy to use and stays moist in package between uses. Wipes are strong and hold up to vigorous cleansing.</li>
    <li> Love these. They smell great.</li>
    <li> These wipes are amazing!! My acne has gotten sufficiently better since starting use of these wipes</li>
    <li> My son has been using the pore scrub for years but just found this item.  It works great.  This is the only product that does not dry out my son&#x27;s skin.  It is perfect for an active teenager.  He can throw into his gym bag to use after a workout, game, etc.</li>
    <li> I use Yes To face wipes at the end of the day to remove makeup. They do a great job, don&#x27;t contain scary ingredients, are vegan and smell nice too. Of the varieties I&#x27;ve tried, though, the tomato is my least favorite. If it does help with acne, I couldn&#x27;t tell; salicylic acid doesn&#x27;t do it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the blueberry instead.</li>
    <li> Love these wipes!  I&#x27;m awful about remembering to take off my makeup after a long day, so having these available before I crash into bed is VERY helpful!  They are pretty thin sheets, so it typically takes two sheets to get my entire face clean (I use separate eye makeup remover).  Overall, great product and one I use regularly.</li>
    <li> I love the Yes to Tomatoes facial scrub, so I expected to like these just as much...but not so much. When going to bed I really hate taking the time to wash my face with a liquid cleaners..I&#x27;m just too lazy and too tired at bedtime to mess with it. I use to use generic baby wipes and I had good results using those with the scrub cleaner in the morning. I natural thought if the scrub works well, I bet the towelettes would be equally as awesome. Their nice big clothes, which I was excited about at first thinking I&#x27;d get the job done with one, but that wasn&#x27;t the case. I&#x27;d wipe my face and have the cloth completely covered in makeup, which is great..but then I&#x27;d wipe again..and again..and again... and I still had makeup coming off (and I promise I do not wear much makeup) It took 2 1/2 towelettes to get everything off, and all that happened was my face broke out even more. I went back to my old routine and my face is clearing up again. So my advice is to not mess with a routine that&#x27;s working great already.</li>
    <li> I liked these a lot, but the cucumber ones seem to remove makeup better and are more refreshing.  I will probably go back to those since they are also easier to find.</li>
    <li> I got these with intentions of only using them immediately after the gym if I was not able to shower right away. I now use them all the time. They cleanse your face without drying it out (as most facial towelettes often do). They have a refreshing clean smell (not heavy on the fragrance). Great brand for a great price</li>
    <li> I prefer natural products in no small part because I dislike fake smelling overly perfumed products.  I was surprised at how much I disliked the scent of these -very perfume -y.&lt;br /&gt;I was tempted to not use them at all but I finished the package. I have no complaints with how they work, just with the scent. Unfortunately that was enough of a drawback to keep me from purchasing these again. I usually like this brand so this was a surprise.</li>
    <li> Love these.  You areally battling acne without harming the environment.  That&#x27;s a &#x27;two-fer&#x27;!</li>
    <li> Ordered them as Christmas gifts for wife and daughters, absolutely love them.  Have begun seeing them in Walgreens drug stores locally as well at similar prices.  Great brand!</li>
    <li> This product made me break out and dosen&#x27;t clean well. The wipes are very dry and don&#x27;t wipe well at all.</li>
    <li> I recently began having terrible cystic acne on my trouble area (chin) and even started developing pimples on my cheeks where I&#x27;ve never had a problem. I have normal to dry, pale, sensitive skin. I began using these wipes in the morning and at night along with Neutrogena&#x27;s rapid clear 2-in-1 fight and fade toner and my skin is looking so much better. I no longer need to apply facial lotion either. I still have some areas to clear up but they are definitely improved. I had tried many other face wipes/washes/topical treatments and none seemed to help. I&#x27;m not thrilled with the smell of the wipes; it&#x27;s not bad, just not my favorite. The wipes also remove makeup well (just avoid your eyes).</li>
    <li> These types of towelettes never clean all the make up off my face, but they all do a great job of getting most off. These work about as well as any other natural towelette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they do work well for clearing acne. I used them every morning to clean my face, tone my skin, and prep my face for acne before applying make up. Great for traveling when I can&#x27;t bring my raw apple cider vinegar with to kill acne. :)</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every brand&#x27;s makeup removing towelettes, but when I found Yes To, my whole life changed. The first &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; (disclaimer: not actually edible) I tried was Blueberry, and inside the opening, it said, &amp;#34;Get ready for compliments!&amp;#34; This couldn&#x27;t have been more true. I normally get 3-5 blemishes a month, but once I started using these makeup removing towelettes, my skin was flawless for two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other brands&#x27; towelettes leave my skin feeling greasy, sensitive, or even burned--Yes To never does. I&#x27;ve tried all the different packs, and each &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; boasts a different result: Blueberry is cleansing, Cucumber rejuvenates, Grapefruit brightens, Carrots are gentle, and Tomatoes fight blemishes. I must say though, having tried them all, I could argue that they all do these things. My skin feels so refreshed and soothed, and I find myself looking forward to the end of the day when I can wipe my makeup away. Even when I don&#x27;t wear makeup, I use one of these babies before washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only qualm is that it can be hard to find these products in my area. Sometimes there aren&#x27;t any nearby, leaving me desperate and forcing me to settle for a greasy feeling face of Neutrogena. Also, I&#x27;m moving out of the country in a few days and I have stocked up on these towelettes, because they are the best ever.</li>
    <li> These are large, gentle wipes that don&#x27;t dry out my skin. I am prone to clogged pores around my nose and chin and can dry out terribly with the wrong product. I can use these around my eyes and they get every bit of mascara (CG lash blast). I&#x27;ve used the Neutrogena wipes too and they leave a slippery feeling on my skin and don&#x27;t help keep my skin clear. I&#x27;ll buy these again. I can use one and go right to bed. My skin feels clean and balanced.</li>
    <li> Sadly these burned my face after a few tries of using them, which I was surprised because I have used other Yes products without any issues. I have pale sensitive skin if that matters.</li>
    <li> My favorite acne product.  It takes off my make up and oil nicely.  Also my esthetician told me that for those with a t zone like mine it is best to use this than to exfoliate.</li>
    <li> I love these wipes but they seem to come inconsistent (wet vs slight wet vs dry).. but when they come good ..they are very cleansing and soothing!</li>
    <li> I read all reviews before I purchased these at a local store for around the same price. I was super hopeful these would work! Ever since having a child my face has had so many break outs and these wipes actually made it worse! I was really disappointed I didn&#x27;t get the same results as other reviewers. I could go without the added perfume scent. One positive is the wipes are a good size and you can easily wipe all of your face with it.</li>
    <li> If you have a teenager you know how hard it is to get them to clean their face consistently.  However, my son loves these and it cleared his face within days.  He uses them consistently because of the low maintenance factor.  Also got rid of the eczema on his face.</li>
    <li> I feel like this works really well at clearing my pimples and preventing new pimples from forming. I like to tear each sheet in half so I don&#x27;t go through these as quickly. Burns slightly but that just means it&#x27;s working, right? ;)</li>
    <li> A great smelling, gentle cleansing wipe that&#x27;s fantastic for a quick face wash or makeup removal.  Used daily and in combination with the YesTo Tomatoes Daily Balancing Moisturizer I was able to keep blemishes away for months before I began creating my own moisturizer and salicylic acid exfoliating paste which has turned out to be superior and less expensive.</li>
    <li> I love this brand. These wipes clear my skin overnight. They are a bit acidic so apply moisturizer after using.</li>
    <li> I subscribe to these wipes every month and love them! Definitely my favorite face wipes.</li>
    <li> Struggled with acne since i was a kid. i&#x27;m now pushing 40. i now live in an RV roaming the country. Water hook up is spotty at best. i use these every day and they keep me from breaking out. it&#x27;s also very refreshing. doesn&#x27;t dry my face out and is inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I love Yes To Tomatoes! These wipes work really well. I love that they&#x27;re on the larger side, so I don&#x27;t have to use more than one at a time. The smell is pleasant and not overwhelming at all. I don&#x27;t have a lot of acne, so this is perfect to keep my skin clean and clear. I also use the Yes To Tomatoes moisturizer, which keeps my skin constantly smooth. Needless to say, I have found a new favorite in facial care.</li>
    <li> These are ok I have used them for a few days. I don&#x27;t really feel like my skin is clean after I use these. I feel like I need to still do my skin routine.  The wipes are a good size and they smell ok. Time will tell if they help keep away the blemishes.</li>
    <li> I love, love this.  Just be careful not to get it to near your eyes if you have senditive eyes.  It will smart.</li>
    <li> I do not like the smell. It smells stale to me, almost like the product is expired. I only say that because it has the same stale smell as the cucumber eye makeup remover pads I bought. Cucumber and Tomato should smell differently and these smell the same and I know the cucumber must be expired because I&#x27;ve bought them from the store and they smell MUCH different. The product, however, did not break me out or cause any skin issues. They are drier and remove significantly less makeup than the blueberry towlettes I purchased in the store.</li>
