      <li>Overall I would give this product an excellent rating for the smell</li>
      <li>Have I been noticed more by woman,,,,yaa.......</li>
      <li>It smells pretty good.  </li>
      <li>The smell is pretty good..</li>
      <li>I feel more confident and there is a level of just feeling good, the smell stays but consciously you don&#x27;t notice it.</li>
      <li>Our primal desires are so strong at times.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>If you really want to attract women, it helps to be good looking or rich...</li>
      <li>It just has too much of an &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34; kind of smell.</li>
      <li>I thing the nature scene and cozy room is best.</li>
      <li>But it smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>so fortunately that&#x27;s not my goal.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is cheap but does not do a thing.</li>
      <li>Oh, did I mention that it&#x27;s cheap?</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to any guy that wants a nice smelling pheromone-infused Cologne.</li>
      <li>have not used it enough to see if ti works will let you know, will try it soon  and find out but smells great</li>
      <li>it doesnt smell good, it has an old man/rubber/exotic/smokey smell.</li>

      <li>it does not stay with you as long as it was advertised but as for a good scent it really smell good</li>
      <li>Smells good have not noticed any excess attractions but never really expected to.</li>
      <li>but i find that it really works and the women love it.</li>

      <li>does it work well with the ladies, well to be continued but its not bad for the price.</li>
      <li>The scent isn&#x27;t my cup of tea, but its not bad.  </li>
      <li>Smell is ok but the product doesn&#x27;t preform it made no difference with it on the most comments were just are you using a different cologne</li>
      <li>Though, granted, the more you put on, the strength of the smell goes as high as one would desire.</li>
      <li>Its smells light crisp musky/cedar and sandalwood smell.</li>
      <li>smell was cool and fresh.</li>
      <li>not really worth wasting your money on, you might even be able to make this with baby oil and water because this is what it smells like, I bought this out of curiosity and boy did it kill the cat!!</li>
      <li>It embraces you with an alluring and fresh quality</li>
      <li>I am a good looking guy and I don&#x27;t really notice anything different.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this twice before and I am a experience pheromone user. Ive also tried pure instince, pherx, arouse rx 4 times(best pheromone ever btw), and androtics products(theyre also good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I get random chattiness from stranger and slight attention. Dont see any arousal effects. A need to be closer to the user is another effect I see. My conclusion is that it has both alpha and beta nol and possibly some androstadienone with a little none. It smells better then polo and most other types of colognes,even axeolognes and isnt too overpowering. Its smells light crisp musky/cedar and sandalwood smell. Good for the price here. Its cheaper here then manufacturers website so buy here. I dont work for either place btw.</li>
    <li> When reading the review of this, I am getting the sense that for one it doesn&#x27;t attract women like people expect, but men seem to love it. I cant say I really want to attract men but hey if that&#x27;s your goal every review at least the guys liked it!</li>
    <li> Will buy again!!! Great Product...Great Seller!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if the pheromone aspect works for this stuff, but the wife really loves the scent regardless.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman writing this review, of my husband, the max attract stinks... And in a way it&#x27;s the opposite</li>
    <li> I wore the cologne while I gave my buddy a sensual massage.  He experienced twitching and the most intense orgasim  ever he said &amp;#34;it was unbelievable&amp;#34; he said the cologne I was wearing put him over the edge.</li>
    <li> Its works good. You should try it .I was amaze how good its works .I have to try it to believe it</li>
    <li> Smell great and Fast ship,Products last all day, didn&#x27;t buy for the title, needed a Cologne that would last and it doe&#x27;s that well A++</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved the smell, deffinetly a head turner, no complaints and had allot of smiles my way, would recomend it.</li>
    <li> I put this fragrance on,and it didnt have any desired effect. The alcohol overpowers the scent. Not recommended at all.</li>
    <li> Great smell quick shipping I don&#x27;t know if it attract but it is a head turner high quality Cologne for a low price</li>
    <li> I am irresistible! And now I smell good too. Haha. I would recommend this to any guy that wants a nice smelling pheromone-infused Cologne.</li>
    <li> This smells like womens perfume. Its no wonder it can attract Women. They want to know what perfume you&#x27;re wearing.</li>
    <li> Smells like an old ladies perfume.  Not at all close to a mans cologne.  And it will give you a headache.</li>
    <li> Smell is ok but the product doesn&#x27;t preform it made no difference with it on the most comments were just are you using a different cologne</li>
    <li> It smells nice but does not work at all. I brought stuff 15 years ago &amp; it worked. Can&#x27;t find that stuff anymore. It cost $20.00 &amp; worked.This stuff is cheap but does not do a thing.</li>
    <li> Our primal desires are so strong at times.&lt;br /&gt;This reinforces and adds excitement to the daily existence&lt;br /&gt;Have used  pheromones before, It&#x27;s freaky when observed&lt;br /&gt;behavior matches your brain game.&lt;br /&gt;Helps you get into the game- - - - opens opportunity for more intervention&lt;br /&gt;Great price hard to think that this is real- - - - such nice smiles and light verbal&lt;br /&gt;batter I&#x27;m bubbling over just thinking about it&lt;br /&gt;murRay</li>
    <li> OK! not so great nor improve anything with hot summer night. regardless, cologne or perfume . I thing the nature scene and cozy room is best.</li>
    <li> Smells good have not noticed any excess attractions but never really expected to. Good cologne for the money though!</li>
    <li> The content of this bottle has a hypnotic quality that clears the senses and sends whiffs of pleasurable scents through the perception. It embraces you with an alluring and fresh quality</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell, and the name Max Attrack couldn&#x27;t be more fitting. I found it to be mesmorizing.</li>
    <li> Wore it to work and I saw no attraction. I&#x27;ll probably wear it to the bar Thursday. I love the smell but because it doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does. I gave it a 3</li>
    <li> It has more of a perfume fragrance. I&#x27;m not a real fan of this stuff. Don&#x27;t use a lot of this, because it can be overwhelming. It gave me a headache.</li>
    <li> Worth the money. It&#x27;ll definitely get her going. I wore this and one girl who never sits by me in classes, sat by me, fake punched me seven times, rested her head on my shoulder, and stole my phone and flipped through all my pictures.</li>
    <li> i think it&#x27;s ok.. smells ok..for the price..i think it attracts only promiscuous girls only to tell you the truth,but im not complaining lol</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of this cologne. it doesnt smell good, it has an old man/rubber/exotic/smokey smell. i am not sure about the hormones thing as women dont really comment on it.</li>
    <li> Did not make me more attractive to women. Just another cologne I have lost all respect for pheromones. Maybe a true actracantnt but cannot be duplicate.</li>
    <li> I like how it smells, so it got a 4 star rated. Don&#x27;t like how small the bottle size is. That is all</li>
    <li> has a very very very noticeable good smell and if u put it u will smell it for a very long period of time</li>
    <li> i ve tried this in many locations. I am a good looking guy and I don&#x27;t really notice anything different. May just be me.</li>
    <li> it smells like baby powder and i get flirted with more without it no chicks wanna dude that smells like babys and if they do RUN!!!! its a trap... they just want babys.... anyway yea chicks dont like it</li>
    <li> I was told there was no change in my body smell and two people claimed I smelled worse due to it.</li>
    <li> It has a good sharp smell for men.About the claims it do.I do not have an honest answer to give,at least a conscious one.Have I been noticed more by woman,,,,yaa.......but that is just it at least.Stills smells very good to me anyways.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Excellent service!!</li>
    <li> I LIKE IT AND ITS SMELL GOOD TOO AND MAY BE I WILL TRY TO BUY MORE BUT WHAT ABOUT THE USE AND REAL EFFECT</li>
    <li> No idea if the pheromones work but Ladies love the smell. &amp;#34;You smell like a baby&amp;#34; is what I always hear</li>
    <li> Although I cant prove if its an attractant cologne, I will guarantee you it smells so good, and mellow that it will satisfy you. Last longer and the smell is not that strong like others, that will make your head hurt.</li>
    <li> Wore it to church.  All the old ladies are now stalking me.  Might want to consider when and where you use it.</li>
    <li> This is ok, I don&#x27;t see much attraction from women using this, there are better products but much more expensive.  It works pretty good for the cost!</li>
    <li> I can say that this is very good and does make a positive impact with women.  I will keep buying it!!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t attract anyone but still smells nice so it is&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad prproduct, just shouldn&#x27;t say it will attract people.  Should say nice smell.</li>
    <li> This is my first time buying pheromone cologne. I was reasonably skeptical, but also hopeful that it would in the least have a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised upon receiving it. The cologne has a fragrant yet slightly musky smell. I found it not too overwhelming and actually quite appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty social and spend a lot of time around women in and outside of work. so I got a lot of impressions from women I know and trust. I received unequivocal approval! More than just a desire for the smell, comments tended to lean towards a desire to be around me because of it and i got an overall sense of increased relaxation from them. No joke! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars and highly recommended. &amp; the price cannot be beat!</li>
    <li> THIS WAS A GREAT PRODUCT. SMELLS GREAT! WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO SMELL GOOD AND ATTRACT THE OTHER SEX!</li>
    <li> Smells great def like how it effects the nose and very manly don&#x27;t know about the other stuff but i&#x27;d def buy again</li>
    <li> I did not buy this for the supposed pheromone claim as I think it&#x27;s highly unlikely and don&#x27;t need assistance getting women. Its all about confidence, I bought this for the good reviews of the scent and I totally agree. Idk why someone claimed this has an old man smell bc it doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not an old man and I&#x27;m not a young immature douche either. This stuff is perfect for the 30-40s (me) and I would even say 20 something age group</li>
    <li> Girl friend loves it and so do I, the smell is nice but short lasting. I&#x27;m not sure if it works but it&#x27;s fun to add to the collection</li>
    <li> I am not really sure about the total pheromone quality as that it has not made me incredibly lucky with the women :(</li>
    <li> I will order this again before I finish the first bottle, got so many attention from guys soon as I am wearing it, some even sniffing and asking what I wear, I normally wear it with another different cologne. never happened to me before and I am gay! I love it</li>
    <li> I bought this product at a local store and the price was super high. The smell is great and the price is just perfect. I feel more confident and there is a level of just feeling good, the smell stays but consciously you don&#x27;t notice it. I will continue to purchase this and from same seller. Great product.</li>
    <li> Very nice soft smelling product which has a lasting smell which lasts upwards to 3 hours per application.  I tried using this product in a club environment with no such luck at all.  I&#x27;ve tried other pheromone products which had an immediate reaction from the ladies however this product comes up short in getting me the opposite sex&#x27;s attention.  I do however like the smell of the product personally and I would add it to my cologne collection solely as a body mist.  Overall I would give this product an excellent rating for the smell however one star for its lack of working as advertised.</li>
    <li> smell was cool and fresh. But as for attracting women. I either didn&#x27;t meet the right ones. Or I am just to ugly.</li>
    <li> I have tried several pheromones. Bought Max Attract recently, and not too sure about it. It just has too much of an &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34; kind of smell. It&#x27;s almost feminine really. Could be probably considered as close to the smell of a woman&#x27;s perfume. This just wasn&#x27;t one that I liked.</li>
    <li> have not used it enough to see if ti works will let you know, will try it soon  and find out but smells great</li>
    <li> The scent isn&#x27;t my cup of tea, but its not bad.  Can&#x27;t speak on the effects claimed on the bottle.  YOU GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this cologne, my wife loves how it smells on me. I will definitely buy this product again!!!</li>
    <li> Smells OK / And that is all it does of course.</li>
    <li> Through and Through i thought this product was going to be a waste of time but i find that it really works and the women love it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me, but it wasn&#x27;t a horrible smell..&lt;br /&gt;Like I said. It was just okay. Save your money?</li>
    <li> I work in an elderly home.  I was just looking for some cheap cologne to attract a girl who I work with and everything went wrong.  I can&#x27;t keep the old woman off of me.  It&#x27;s like a really bad Axe commercial.  The product works, just use it  wisely.</li>
    <li> Hi, this product is much better than I expected-for the 9.50 cent price. tried it out with 2 other pheromone products. Without mentioning there names because they are good products also. But this aroma my wife prefers than the other more expensive products. But it is not as sutle as other pheromone products. Martin</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make a bit of difference with the ladies.  It smells okay though.</li>
    <li> It has a positive affect on women.</li>
    <li> Gentlemen, you just found your next cologne, and possibily, the last cologne you will ever want to purchase. If you are reading this review, this is what you are looking for. I will say this now, I have no idea if it works to attact the ladies, but this is definitely the scent that will make you stand out in the room. You won&#x27;t find any cologne that will make you instantly more attractive, sorry to disappoint you, but you simply won&#x27;t. It&#x27;s all in the confidence, and with this smell on, you can be confident that your scent is not one of the many probable short comings you may have at picking up the girl next door or at work. It&#x27;s soft and sweat, and absolutely pleasing to senses. I find myself using it even when spending the day at home. This is by no means a strong, musky old man smell. While not necessarily a &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; smelling cologne once it sets in, it travels quite well so that it&#x27;s noticed. Though, granted, the more you put on, the strength of the smell goes as high as one would desire. I recommend starting with two full sprays across the neck for starters and go from there. Give this stuff a try, best cologne quality and smell for the price.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this review because I bought this to experiment both at the gym (where there is always a lot of women) and at work where there are a few girls I know and flirt with on occasion. I have not noticed anything regarded attraction, extra smiles or even anything suggested by what pheromones can do in the opposite sex. HOWEVER, I love the way this smells and will be ordering it again because of the subtle sent. To me it smells like clean sweat after being outside in the sun and wind for a little bit, its hard to explain but smells awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I have researched and bought other pheromones from both amazon and from another website... I can tell you that if you want pheromones that actual work the way you would hope, you are going to pay a little for it because pheromones aren&#x27;t cheep to manufacture. There are several different kinds of pheromones that trigger different kinds of reactions too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to ask or leave a comment in the comment section...&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps</li>
    <li> I need another bottle! &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really works!&lt;br /&gt;The first night i tried it, it worked right away. Awesome</li>
    <li> very happy...no problems...thank you</li>
    <li> not really worth wasting your money on, you might even be able to make this with baby oil and water because this is what it smells like, I bought this out of curiosity and boy did it kill the cat!!</li>
    <li> I like the scent but it don&#x27;t seem to last.  I wear it to bed when i want to provoke some action with my wife, the scent does something to her but as for the other females, i haven&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
    <li> Great great scent.  My wife absolutely loves it.  The scent is great but unlike great colognes, the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as you would hope.</li>
    <li> This product smells good but other then that no effect on attraction but like I said it does smell good</li>
    <li> I dont know if it actually works like it advertises, but I like the smell.</li>
    <li> I might be my imagination but when I put this stuff on women look at me differently, like they want me to take of my cloth differently. I kid you not. I did not think it could work but it those. Great price also. This stuff smell good too.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t feel it make differant</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the thought that counts. I think that perhaps wearing this gives me a confidence boost regardless of if it actually works due to pheremones or whatever.</li>
    <li> The smell is pretty good.. does it work well with the ladies, well to be continued but its not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s just me, but this cologne did not have the desired results. My wife just said \\&quot;that smells nice\\&quot; and walked away.&lt;br /&gt;Since I became wheelchair bound 8 years ago, MY appeal has apparently evaporated. Oh, I&#x27;m well cared for, and loved like a brother; but the intimacy has left, leaving me frustrated and morose. Good thing I have a sense of humor. Anyway, this California Exotics Max Attract Sex Cologne smells terrific, so I passed it on to my son to enhance his marriage. [[ASIN:B006PAX6CS California Exotics Max Attract Sex Cologne, 1 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Seems to work. The women seem to be paying more attention to me since I tried this product. It also has a nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it work but it does smell good. it does not stay with you as long as it was advertised but as for a good scent it really smell good</li>
    <li> To the pheromone effect I cannot attest. But it smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> It smells pretty good.  My wife seems to like it,  I&#x27;m not trying to attract women other than her, so if she likes it it&#x27;s great for the price.  If you really want to attract women, it helps to be good looking or rich... I&#x27;m neither, so fortunately that&#x27;s not my goal.  Oh, did I mention that it&#x27;s cheap?</li>
    <li> THE SCENT KEEP THE WOMEN ATTETION</li>
    <li> I like this smell it smells very good and smell last long throughout the day. The women love you too, I got a BJ because of the erotic sent.</li>
