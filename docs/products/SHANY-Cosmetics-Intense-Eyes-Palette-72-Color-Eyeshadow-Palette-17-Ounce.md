<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I liked the price of this palette and I do not wear a lot of eye shadow so that is what prompted me to check it out! It definitely has an array of shimmery colors.  I read previous reviews about this product and I took the advice to wear a primer on my eyelids and that seems to help the creasing a bit!  The palette itself is easy to take with you places.  I feel like there are some repeats of colors in it, but maybe I am colorblind! :-)</li>
    <li> Opened the package and BANG! Eyeshadow everywhere. Very bright colors though 2 eyeshadows were broke luckily not colors i use often. Very bright and beautiful colors though. Would definetly buy again. Package needs to be labeled as fragile though. :) just a tip.</li>
    <li> Lots of colors, exactly as pictured. Looks nice enough for a gift.</li>
    <li> I love this palette.  The colors are amazing. The color lasts for a long time.  Packaging was fantastic. I received my order within 4 days.  I would recommend this to everyone who wants an awesome palette of great quality eye shadows.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with product! The colors are vibrant and very shimmery! I would recommend this product to any and all people whom are in search for an easy application eye shadow! I did one layer of color, and it was beautiful everything I look for in an eye shadow</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be that great for the price. With a primer the colors POP. A color for every outfit and with primer stays all day. It does crease a BIT but nothing awful. You don&#x27;t need a lot so just go light. Def worth the money.</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow is beautiful!! Great quality for the price!! Very pigmented, soft to the touch this palette is not matte its more shimmer like love it!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors!! All shimmery. My dislike was that these eyeshadows are hard to pick up on synthetic brushes and 3 of my colors were broken. But lasting power is medium on inner corner of tear duct area. On lid long lasting.</li>
    <li> the product quality is so low , that by the time it arrives to your door step its already broken and felt apart</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful, but the set arrived with a broken shadow!</li>
    <li> Awesome makeup!  Never looses the shimmer, colors are vibrant and very fun!  Very impressed with the excellent quality!  I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> your product keeps coming to me even as a exchange damaged were 4 shadows in the kit are destroyed an that&#x27;s not fair that I have to pay for it I don&#x27;t have time to keep packaging it up I work a lot that&#x27;s wrong it truly is</li>
    <li> greatest eye make-up i have ever had. And the colors stay all day! you won&#x27;t regret buying it! will definitely buy more for sure!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and when I received it, all of they eyeshadow was broken. It was not even usable. So I returned it and asked for a replacement, and the second one came even more broken up. I am very disappointed because I was looking forward to being able to use it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product a few weeks ago, when I opened the case, poof! Eyeshadow everywhere! So I finally got around to contacting amazon about the problem, wrote them an email explaining what happened, and today before I could even check my email to see if they wrote me back, there was a box on my doorstep containing a new case of eyeshadow in perfect condition! Wonderful customer service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the great customer service, the colors really pop, doesn&#x27;t smudge through out the day and looks like any expensive eyeshadow that you&#x27;d  pay 3x&#x27;s as much for anywhere else. Love it!</li>
    <li> Would have loved this but it arrived damaged.  Several of the shadows had been crushed and loose and then were a mess all over the place!</li>
    <li> I love Shany eye shadows, they always have a lot of pigment / shine and stay on for a long time!</li>
    <li> I love this palette! It comes with a great variety of different shades to pick from! Perfect for a smokey, natural or any other look! I love the beautiful colors in this palette! It&#x27;s amazing! :D Perfect for a gift!</li>
    <li> This is an AWESOME palette! I love the colors. The bright and bold colors made my eyes pop. The palette offered a wide variety of colors that fit any occassion. I especially like the blues and greens, which are great for fall.</li>
    <li> I love the bold colors of this palette and they stay on pretty well and also have really high pigment. The only downer for me is that EVERY shadow is shimmer/glittery! All 72 of them. I like shimmer, but I don&#x27;t like wearing ALL shimmer shadow. You need a matte shadow or 2 in order for your eye application to look nice and blended instead of a muddy, glittery mess. If you need some shimmer shadows, definitely get this, It&#x27;s a great price....but make sure you have a few matte shadows at home to blend in the crease with them. A good palette to have in Your collection, not the best to wear for every day or at the office daily.</li>
    <li> These colors are a lot of fun! The only problem was that two of the trays were broken when delivered, which I almost expected when I read the reviews on it. HOWEVER, after just a few minutes of fine tweezing skills I had most of them back in the right place. Also, I contacted customer service and they were prompt on answering and told me if I wanted to I could switch the products out. Sad that they were broken, but happy with how it was handled.</li>
    <li> This is the go-to palette for bold eyes and a wide-range of looks that looks really great combine together! Really love this palette!</li>
    <li> Look at all those wonderful colors and that mirror in the middle. Just think of all the fun you could have trying so many different color combinations.</li>
    <li> These colors are my favorite colors that SHANY offers. I don&#x27;t have to put so many layers on, it just works. The mirror it comes with is nice because I&#x27;m always on the go so I don&#x27;t have to run to the bathroom to apply it. Very functional!</li>
    <li> This palette is awesome. It&#x27;s super bright, and you can create and have so many different fun looks with it! 72 colors to pick from is pretty awesome!</li>
    <li> It sucks because we never had this before! But SHANY is the way to go! For the holidays, Im getting a SHANY makeup train case! Can&#x27;t wait to recieve this item in the mail!</li>
    <li> I like this palette for the most part, but some of the colors are very transparent and don&#x27;t show up very well unless you put a similar matte color on first.  If you like shimmer and pigmented eyeshadows this is a good palette to use.  However, the packaging was a joke, received it in a small yellow envelope via mail, obviously is going to be shaken around and broken easily, about 5 or 6 of the colors were broken when I opened it.</li>
    <li> Not that bright nor intense, I&#x27;m looking for their eyeshadow that matches up with the Shany 2011 All in One makeup set and this didn&#x27;t succeed. Extremely disappointed and now have a palette of eyeshadow I&#x27;ll never wear... Maybe my sister might like it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most versatile palettes I have owned. The colors are vibrant, richly pigmented and go on like silk. This would be a great addition to any makeup collection or the perfect start to a new one!</li>
    <li> A must for every diva! What more shadow looks could you want? This versatile kit is the bomb! As comparable to other cosmetic companies, but Shany is not animal tested. That is a great thing to know as I am a animal lover.</li>
    <li> Though I have not bought this product, I really liked the look of the image of it.  When I do run out of eyeshadow from Shany, I will buy this eyeshadow.  In general, I am quite pleased with the eyeshadow from Shany, because they are affordable, and long lasting, and look great for any complexion and skin color.  They are really a great deal for the price.  I am a satisfied customer for Shany cosmetics.</li>
    <li> This palette isn&#x27;t huge, but that makes it convenient  and easy to use on the go if need be. The colors are amazing, and the pigment in them is to die for. I love this palette so much.</li>
    <li> such a big selection of colors its so had to choose from in the morning. i love this pallet because it intensifies your eyes and it works for every skin type it works great!!</li>
    <li> 72 different eyeshadow. the palette isn&#x27;t that big. the colors are very pigmented and also shimmery and glittery for people that doesnt like shimmery i wouldnt recommend but other than that it is a great product.</li>
    <li> these colors are so intense especially the blues! as for me I love intense colors! they are super pigmented and would really recommend if your the type of girl that loves that POP of color on your lid! so many pretty colors to choose from</li>
    <li> My husband bought me this eyeshadow palette for Christmas. He didn&#x27;t know what eye shadow colors I liked (neutrals), so he got me the whole she-bang. So far, I love it! I&#x27;m not really sure what to do with aqua or red or forest green, but I&#x27;ve used up all of the colors that I like. I think this is the first eye shadow that doesn&#x27;t break me out. It also goes on smoothly and blends very well. I love it!</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow is simply amazing. I can&#x27;t say enough about it. The compliments I receive while wearing this product are remarkable. I will be purchasing more of your products soon.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed I is light weight, easy to travel with, has a lot to choose from, quality, and a good price! There are colors from bright blue to bright red but there is also all the nude and natural colors. It also has a good size mirror. I really like this pallet!</li>
    <li> I love it and it is awesome!!! My friend saw this online and told me about it. I am so glad I got this. :-)</li>
    <li> The colors are great! They are a pretty good quality, and it&#x27;s probably the best make up palette for its price. The only issue is that one of the eyeshadows came broken, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for the great color assortment.</li>
    <li> I love a highly pigmented shadow and these don&#x27;t disappoint.  Create intense, dramatic looks with awesome color payout.  Plus the case is sleek and compact.</li>
    <li> This palette is to die for!!  Super bright and pigmented colors, Shany was right on in naming this Intense.  I love how smooth the colors are, and with a little help from a primer, they last all day and into the night.  I love love love this palette!</li>
