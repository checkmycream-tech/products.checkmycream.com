<ol>
      <li>And GREAT price!</li>
      <li>However, if you&#x27;re figity like I am then these are not the best choice.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with these!!</li>
      <li>This eyewear was perfect for me since I always use a laydown bed.</li>
      <li>Awesome!</li>
      <li>Provide excellent protection but can still cause &amp;#34;raccoon&amp;#34; effect around eyes.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with my purchase and my &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34; are disappearing!  </li>
      <li>these are perfect for those that will sit in the sun and tan, just don&#x27;t overdo it.</li>
      <li>they are amazing to use!!!!</li>
      <li>Very Happy!</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for a standup but perfect for my laydown and does its job!</li>
      <li>Love the no raccoon tan lines!!!</li>
      <li>These work great.  </li>
      <li>They work great and came on time.</li>
      <li>They work great for me</li>
      <li>but otherwise they are great.</li>
      <li>But, if you use them the way they were intended, Sunsets are a great addition to your indoor tanning paraphernalia.  </li>
      <li>works good, just wish it came with a string to hold them when moving around in tanning bed.</li>
      <li>They work good</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re good to go.</li>
      <li>I thought that they would be a good compromise to help save my eyes from some of the UV rays as I was sunning.  </li>
      <li>There good for the price</li>
      <li>Perfect product - sized just right!</li>
      <li>The color &#x27;s are nice , and bright .</li>
      <li>I love these!</li>
      <li>Great product and quick delivery!</li>
      <li>Nice product.  </li>
      <li>NOT for stand and tan units as they are not the gel kind that stay in the eye standing up</li>
      <li>but then again what kind of eye wear CAN you use in a stand up bed?  </li>
      <li>I wanted them to work because I liked the concept.  </li>
      <li>I just wish they came in a nice lil case.</li>
      <li>They are perfect for the lay down beds and provide great coverage for my eyes.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>Better then nothing.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
      <li>Although the sunsets did protect my eyes 100% from uv rays and looked kind of cool, I found they did nothing to prevent the dreaded \\&quot;racoon</li>
      <li>I like these because they&#x27;re easy to keep in my purse</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t had any difficulty keeping them on with a strong fan blowing or while placing a towel over my face.</li>
      <li>These are great, I barely feel them!</li>
      <li>are still protected,,, theyre great in general!</li>
      <li>Works fine does what it&#x27;s supposed to no string</li>
      <li>and they don&#x27;t keep light out.</li>
      <li>they will not leave you with raccoon eyes and fit the eye socket comfortably.</li>
      <li>Not going to lie, these things are cheaply made.</li>
      <li>They fit over my eyes.</li>
      <li>If you are looking out to block out the light %100 do not buy these.  </li>
      <li>For some reason it grosses me out to wear ones that others have worn even though they say they clean them.  </li>
      <li>But then again, I always bring hand sanitizer with me to clean the bed before using it because I don&#x27;t trust them to clean that either.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a pair of these before (blue) and loved them but lost them in a move and had to get another set (purple, this time).</li>
      <li>They fit right over my eyes and do not leave string marks.</li>
      <li>got these based on other seller feedback and am happy with them.  </li>
      <li>These are great for a lay down bed because they don&#x27;t have the thing in between them to make a line on your nose.</li>
      <li>Fast shipment too!!  </li>
      <li>They fit great, keeping them clean is tough but worth it!</li>
      <li>I think they will be great for tanning outside in my backyard in the summer when it doesn&#x27;t matter so much if they fall off, but the bottom line is they just don&#x27;t cut it for any kind of long tanning session.</li>
      <li>These fit very well and help with circles around eyes.</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>/&gt;Apparently for indoor tanning the AC blows them right off</li>
      <li>A little blurry to look through, but an excellent effect that totally obscures your eyes.  </li>
      <li>I keep this extra pair in my gym bag, I got the blue ones and They are great.</li>
      <li>so they do the job pretty well...</li>
      <li>Came exactly as shown.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t feel they protect my eyes very well either!</li>
      <li>I brought it the first time I went tanning, and I do not regret buying this at all.</li>
      <li>These suckers are great for obscuring your eyes by hot gluing them into the eye holes of a costume mask.  </li>
      <li>They are affordable and much cheaper than getting them from my salon and that&#x27;s including the shipping price!</li>
      <li>Allows a lot more light in than previous eye wear I&#x27;ve had.</li>
      <li>Great purchase, other than I wish you could actually pick the color.</li>
      <li>In shape and size they fit comfortably in the eye and do not have sharp corners or edges which is always the main issue when buying these.</li>
      <li>These little beauties work great until I sweat, then they slid off with just a tiny movement of my head.</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping, Much cheaper than a tanning salon.</li>
      <li>I thought they sounded like a great idea because the elastic string on my peepers annoyed me</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t really want a tan line across the bridge of my nose.  </li>
      <li>I really like these things.  </li>
      <li>They do not block out enough light and fall off your eyes if you move your head at all.  </li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t wear them standing but other than that while laying on sunbed ok.</li>
      <li>I purchased them from the market place, and when they arrived the top of the goggles were already a little scratched up.  </li>
      <li>I thought this item would conform to eyes a little better...</li>
      <li>These were made for INDOOR TANNING ONLY, you must lie with you head PERFECTLY STILL AND UPRIGHT for them to stay on, if you wan to tilt your face a little, no can do they fall</li>
      <li>They are clear plastic with UV protection supposedly but with sunshine burning straight through them</li>
      <li>I had to tan a few more times without goggles (which I NEVER do)</li>
      <li>They were supposed to be new.</li>
      <li>Great in concept, horrible in execution, try as I might I have not been able to get these to work and stay in place.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Must lay completely still when using these.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really like just get the regular ones</li>
      <li>but if you just lay on your back and not turn your head, left to right..</li>
      <li>But, after reading into how dangerous it was to not wear any protection for your eyes and after noticing that even with my eyes closed the tanning bed lights were super freaking bright</li>
      <li>The problem is that they are barely any darker than clear plastic.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>I ordered these because they help keep tanning safeish without having to worry about the normal tan lines you get from regular tanning goggles.</li>
      <li>They also do not fit close enough to the face to block out all the light.  </li>
      <li>These things provide almost no additional protection because they are completely see-through, not nearly dark enough.</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re clear so you could open your eyes</li>
      <li>I recently bought a pair of \\&quot;Sunsets\\&quot; after leaving my trusty \\&quot;Peepers\\&quot; in my car while it was getting fixed.  </li>
      <li>work as expected - thanks</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s worth the trouble.</li>
      <li>So small an item only carries 3 concerns really...size (big enough in this case),light leaks (none,these do the job) and comfort (smooth with no sharp points or grooves)</li>
      <li>I have enough experience with poor eyes and sunlight to know that closing your eyes does not do enough to protect your eyes from direct light.</li>
      <li>too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not for outdoors tanning, wind, and tilting your head even slightly will knock these things straight</li>
      <li>You can see through these when you are in the tanning bed, and also them seem a little large and cover up part of the under eye on your face, so you still get raccoon eyes</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Gets the job done. Fits eyes well.</li>
    <li> These work great.  They are meant for use laying down on your back, as they have no strap.  That&#x27;s the idea - they won&#x27;t give you raccoon eyes like strap goggles will.  People who gave these a low rating probably don&#x27;t understand that they are meant to work as advertised.</li>
    <li> There good for the price</li>
    <li> they fall off a lot, but they leave less tan marks then regular goggles. so it&#x27;s worth the trouble.</li>
    <li> In view of negative reviews:  I have NO problem keeping these in place in a lay-down bed, and it is not like I keep very still. These are, of course, not for stand up tanning.   They are, also, see through, which you cannot see from the picture.   Hope this helps</li>
    <li> I trashed these after only 1 use. These do goggles are junk.  They do not block out enough light and fall off your eyes if you move your head at all.  Also if the AC in the tanning bed is blowing on your face, the goggles can not stay on.  They also do not fit close enough to the face to block out all the light.  I purchased them from the market place, and when they arrived the top of the goggles were already a little scratched up.  They were supposed to be new.</li>
    <li> They work great for me I just wish they came in a nice lil case.</li>
    <li> These suckers are great for obscuring your eyes by hot gluing them into the eye holes of a costume mask.  A little blurry to look through, but an excellent effect that totally obscures your eyes.  However, the color you receive is random, green blue or pink.</li>
    <li> If you are looking out to block out the light %100 do not buy these.  They are sheer, I don&#x27;t see the point.</li>
    <li> These were made for INDOOR TANNING ONLY, you must lie with you head PERFECTLY STILL AND UPRIGHT for them to stay on, if you wan to tilt your face a little, no can do they fall right off!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently for indoor tanning the AC blows them right off too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not for outdoors tanning, wind, and tilting your head even slightly will knock these things straight off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little plastic ones with holes on them stay on wayyy better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel they protect my eyes very well either! They are clear plastic with UV protection supposedly but with sunshine burning straight through them I don&#x27;t think they are fully protecting your eyes.</li>
    <li> I use these because I don&#x27;t want the nose band tan line. However, if you&#x27;re figity like I am then these are not the best choice. But, I do use them every time I&#x27;m not in a stand up tanning bed.</li>
    <li> Not going to lie, these things are cheaply made. Very thin plastic, when you wear these it is similar to looking through an empty bottle of Mountain Dew.</li>
    <li> They fit great, keeping them clean is tough but worth it! Better then nothing. Came in a package that keeps them together,that helps.</li>
    <li> I recently bought a pair of \\&quot;Sunsets\\&quot; after leaving my trusty \\&quot;Peepers\\&quot; in my car while it was getting fixed.  Unlike traditional tanning goggles, Sunsets are only for the lay down beds and only if you lay on your back.  I thought they sounded like a great idea because the elastic string on my peepers annoyed me and I didn&#x27;t really want a tan line across the bridge of my nose.  Although the sunsets did protect my eyes 100% from uv rays and looked kind of cool, I found they did nothing to prevent the dreaded \\&quot;racoon eye\\&quot; except for not having a band in between them.  I don&#x27;t have particularly long eyelashes, but I find even when my eyes are closed my eyelashes still blink a little and the Sunsets kept falling off and I would have to get up out of the bed and search for them.  Also, if I were to put the towel over my face for any part of my tanning session it would cause them to fall off.  I think they will be great for tanning outside in my backyard in the summer when it doesn&#x27;t matter so much if they fall off, but the bottom line is they just don&#x27;t cut it for any kind of long tanning session.</li>
    <li> I like these because they&#x27;re easy to keep in my purse and I don&#x27;t have to use the eyewear at the tanning salon.  For some reason it grosses me out to wear ones that others have worn even though they say they clean them.  But then again, I always bring hand sanitizer with me to clean the bed before using it because I don&#x27;t trust them to clean that either.</li>
    <li> works good, just wish it came with a string to hold them when moving around in tanning bed.</li>
    <li> Great in concept, horrible in execution, try as I might I have not been able to get these to work and stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these to use outside in the sun (not in a tanning booth).  I thought that they would be a good compromise to help save my eyes from some of the UV rays as I was sunning.  Thus far, I have been unable to get these to stay on my face for more than a few seconds.  I don&#x27;t know if there is any trick to them or not .... but for me, they do not work.  I wanted them to work because I liked the concept.  But they do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product and quick delivery! I&#x27;ve had a pair of these before (blue) and loved them but lost them in a move and had to get another set (purple, this time). I had them the day after I ordered them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative feedback seems to relate to a misunderstanding of the products purpose.  It&#x27;s one of a few types of indoor tanning eye protection; each helpful in different circumstances.  Sunsets are not meant to be used in stand-up beds.  They don&#x27;t strap to your face (like traditional goggles) or apply by adhesive (like Wink Ease).  They are 2 separate translucent hard plastic somewhat-dome-shaped pieces that rest on your eyes while laying on your back (similar to &#x27;sun globes&#x27;). Because of this, they can be a bit awkward.  But, if you use them the way they were intended, Sunsets are a great addition to your indoor tanning paraphernalia.  I keep Wink Ease for times when the Sunsets aren&#x27;t applicable (like stand-up beds) because I don&#x27;t want a line across my nose/temples &amp; don&#x27;t want to rely on disposables (Wink Ease) for every trip.  If they&#x27;re falling off in a lay-down bed, I can only imagine you must be turning onto your side or propping your head up.  They can&#x27;t be expected to stay on if you&#x27;re doing backflips in there.  Ha ha. Use another type if you will not be laying flat and facing up.  Also, my long eyelashes haven&#x27;t been a problem and I haven&#x27;t had any difficulty keeping them on with a strong fan blowing or while placing a towel over my face.</li>
    <li> This eyewear was perfect for me since I always use a laydown bed. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for a standup but perfect for my laydown and does its job!</li>
    <li> These goggles weren&#x27;t that bad. You can&#x27;t wear them standing but other than that while laying on sunbed ok. I would consider them again for purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered these because they help keep tanning safeish without having to worry about the normal tan lines you get from regular tanning goggles. They&#x27;re a metallic color, but are see through. The only thing that disappointed me is I looked at the colors they offer and told my husband I like them all except red and OF COURSE I got the red ones. Great purchase, other than I wish you could actually pick the color.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really like just get the regular ones</li>
    <li> These are great for a lay down bed because they don&#x27;t have the thing in between them to make a line on your nose. If you&#x27;re looking for something for a stand up bed, look elsewhere, unless you want to squeeze your eyes together as tightly as you can. These are great, I barely feel them!</li>
    <li> Works fine does what it&#x27;s supposed to no string so if you need one these are not for you. I like em</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t stay on, at all.</li>
    <li> They work well met my expectations. The color &#x27;s are nice , and bright . They stay on your eye&#x27;s while laying still.</li>
    <li> I like that the two pieces are separate, which gives you a lot of flexibility in how you wear them and where you position them. The problem is that they are barely any darker than clear plastic. They have almost no tint and they don&#x27;t keep light out. I want to protect my eyes from the sun, and I thought these were supposed to do that. I have enough experience with poor eyes and sunlight to know that closing your eyes does not do enough to protect your eyes from direct light. These things provide almost no additional protection because they are completely see-through, not nearly dark enough. I put several layers of dark tape around the outsides of mine and use them that way.</li>
    <li> I brought it the first time I went tanning, and I do not regret buying this at all. I don&#x27;t know what others say about this, but they don&#x27;t fall off your face. I mean if you&#x27;re constantly moving around, yeah they&#x27;re gunna fall off your face but if you just lay on your back and not turn your head, left to right.. they&#x27;re good to go. they&#x27;re clear so you could open your eyes and you&#x27;re eyes are still protected,,, theyre great in general!</li>
    <li> I bought these SPECIFICALLY to avoid &amp;#34;raccoon eyes,&amp;#34; and after just two uses I looked like I was some comedic movie character who fell asleep on the beach and someone played a prank on me. It was seriously so obvious and embarrassing I had to tan a few more times without goggles (which I NEVER do) just to even things out a little bit. I did myself a BIG FAVOR and ended up buying the Wink Ease sticker goggles, which are amaaaaaazing - although they can be slightly prices since you only get 3-6 uses out of each pair before the sticky properties wear off.</li>
    <li> These little beauties work great until I sweat, then they slid off with just a tiny movement of my head.</li>
    <li> You can see through these when you are in the tanning bed, and also them seem a little large and cover up part of the under eye on your face, so you still get raccoon eyes</li>
    <li> Nice product.  I use outside to tan when on my back.  got these based on other seller feedback and am happy with them.  Random color sent to you (can&#x27;t pick).</li>
    <li> These fit very well and help with circles around eyes. My only complaint would be that you are unable to pick a color but otherwise they are great.</li>
    <li> I had to constantly re-adjust them and sometimes they would fall out while I was tanning and I was worried that I was getting eye damage.</li>
    <li> Hard plastic,loose,no strap and no holes to add one as these are designed to be worn only as is. In shape and size they fit comfortably in the eye and do not have sharp corners or edges which is always the main issue when buying these. So small an item only carries 3 concerns really...size (big enough in this case),light leaks (none,these do the job) and comfort (smooth with no sharp points or grooves) I received a pair the same blue color as the picture. Came exactly as shown. NOT for stand and tan units as they are not the gel kind that stay in the eye standing up and they feature no tape inside.</li>
    <li> Must lay completely still when using these.  They do not stay well at all but do not leave that awful tan line on the nose...</li>
    <li> Perfect product - sized just right!</li>
    <li> They fit over my eyes. But they don&#x27;t stay well.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. They fit right over my eyes and do not leave string marks. They work great and came on time.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping, Much cheaper than a tanning salon. I keep this extra pair in my gym bag, I got the blue ones and They are great. No raccoon eyes, &amp; I have a small face!</li>
    <li> I love these! They are perfect for the lay down beds and provide great coverage for my eyes. I was reading some reviews and complaints about having issues opening eyes with these and I don&#x27;t see where they can complain!  I have very long eyelashes and I had no problem what so ever! Not sure when ill be needing to order a new pair but I would imagine these will last awhile! Even if I did need to order again I would! They are affordable and much cheaper than getting them from my salon and that&#x27;s including the shipping price! Very Happy!</li>
    <li> work as expected - thanks</li>
    <li> Works alright. Sometimes they fall off because the fan in the bed blows them off.. but that&#x27;s not necessarily a product defect.. just something to throw out there!</li>
    <li> they are amazing to use!!!!</li>
    <li> I thought this item would conform to eyes a little better...the least little shift in movement of eyes or body and they fall off.</li>
    <li> these are perfect for those that will sit in the sun and tan, just don&#x27;t overdo it. they will not leave you with raccoon eyes and fit the eye socket comfortably.</li>
    <li> I really like these things.  I used to not wear any type of eye wear in the tanning bed at all bc I didn&#x27;t want raccoon eyes that everyone was talking about getting with those little glasses.  But, after reading into how dangerous it was to not wear any protection for your eyes and after noticing that even with my eyes closed the tanning bed lights were super freaking bright and I really felt like it was really stupid for me not to have some sort of protection on my eyes so I started looking into eyewear that wouldn&#x27;t be too bad and I came across these.  They work good they don&#x27;t make u have raccoon eyes so they do the job pretty well...U def can&#x27;t use them in a stand up bed but then again what kind of eye wear CAN you use in a stand up bed?  I don&#x27;t use the laydown beds anyways so it didn&#x27;t matter but I would recommend these to my friends or anyone that doesn&#x27;t want to use the eye protection from the tanning places.</li>
    <li> Provide excellent protection but can still cause &amp;#34;raccoon&amp;#34; effect around eyes. No strap in the middle leaves out the tan line on your nose.</li>
    <li> Does what it says, They are  like other reviewers have said, Plastic but I&#x27;ve had no problems with keeping them in place, but I don&#x27;t move around alot in the bed either. I like to just lay and relax while I&#x27;m tanning. I do like them and will order them again if I loose these.</li>
    <li> Affordable eyewear for a lay down tanning bed.  Allows a lot more light in than previous eye wear I&#x27;ve had. Cannot use in stand up bed  or if you like to flip from back to stomach during a session in a lay down bed.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Love the no raccoon tan lines!!! I have always been worried about the little lines from the ones that are connected between the eyes or have a string around your head. Solves that problem!</li>
    <li> I had &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34; from using the tanning salon goggles so I searched for some eyewear on Amazon and of course I found it!  I am very happy with these!! They are only for tanning beds but that is all I use anyway.  I am very happy with my purchase and my &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34; are disappearing!  :)  Fast shipment too!!  And GREAT price! Thank you!!!!!</li>
    <li> stops that little line across the nose</li>
    <li> Do their job in the tanning bed without giving you the white line across your nose. Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
