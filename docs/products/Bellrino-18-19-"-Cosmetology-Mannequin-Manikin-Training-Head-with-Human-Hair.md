      <li>Arrived good, good quality.</li>
      <li>I ordered two of these mannequins for state board and practice, and let me start by saying that the quality of the hair is exceptional.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not the most experienced w/ these type items</li>
      <li>It was delivered exactly when it was advertised which was great!!  </li>
      <li>My daughter love it !</li>
      <li>Hair quality is really nice.</li>
      <li>She is ok, the hair lays nice and for teaching she works well.</li>

      <li>I love this doll I love it.</li>
      <li>the money better  </li>
      <li>Hair is ok, mininal shedding.</li>
      <li>I was pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>Most of them are $50 to $100.</li>
      <li>and I wanted something that was more than doll hair.</li>
      <li>At most it&#x27;s 10&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>but I am pleased with this one as well.  </li>
      <li>The first one ordered 11/14 was great, very consistent in length, good texture and smooth hair.</li>
      <li>but I feel like it is pretty good.</li>
      <li>Good price and was exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>Bought it for my daughter its perfect the hair is soft and full well worth</li>
      <li>These doll heads hair is real human hair good quality and overall are excellent to work with.</li>
      <li>but apparently no news is good news!</li>
      <li>She did just fine.  </li>
      <li>Worked fine for teaching class.</li>
      <li>worked fine, but the hair doesn&#x27;t hold moisture.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s very happy with the quality of the head in general and the hair in particular.</li>
      <li>This fit the bill...</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will be great for practicing curls and other hairstyles.</li>
      <li>The Yolanda is my favorite because it is the most realistic for their hair</li>
      <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>Just the right amount!</li>
      <li>So if your practicing thermal curling, wet sets like pin curl, roller setting, and styling and up do&#x27;s along with color processing this is great, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for finger waving</li>
      <li>Im not shocked, you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s 10 years old and getting ideas on styling her own hair</li>
      <li>Will probably end up getting her a better one of better quality later.</li>
      <li>The hair comes out easily and it is very straggly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s totally worth</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s still worth purchasing</li>
      <li>good hair texture for fingerwaves wet sets ect</li>
      <li>Other than that good product.</li>
      <li>I was excited when I  made the purchase, because the description said 100% real hair</li>
      <li>Her hair does not lay right for the thermal.</li>
      <li>And the hair is long which is really nice.</li>
      <li>It does not blow dry nice either.</li>
      <li>Good quality hair, good for cutting</li>
      <li>but it came really almost a week earlier :)</li>
      <li>Good for cutting practice, roller set practice and curling but the quality of the hair is not so great and the length was not the same all the way around and that&#x27;s about it</li>
      <li>good when running hand through but otherwise started shedding when I brushed it otherwise when I flat iron it</li>
      <li>The hair is super soft and real.</li>
      <li>she really likes it and plays with it for hours.</li>
      <li>Would spend a few more dollars and get a better head next time.</li>
      <li>I really wish I can return</li>
      <li>This worked very well for my wife who is in cosmetology, it came in fast and did a get job for her.</li>
      <li>Hair much shorter than photo shows.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I received this.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel like real hair at all.</li>
      <li>the actual CLEAN length is no longer</li>
      <li>100% human, natural growth pattern, doesn&#x27;t get matted easily when rinsing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The hair is really soft and takes to an iron pretty well.</li>
      <li>but so far my daughter who is 18, finishing up her senior year of high school, and going into cosmetology loves it.</li>
      <li>Even better quality than the more expensive ones you get at beauty supply stores!</li>
      <li>Applied bleach to it just the way I do to my clients and 5 mins later the hair starts to smoke and it got really hot.</li>
      <li>I purchased this item because I&#x27;ve recently become interested in hair/hairstyling.</li>
      <li>and then would be too short  because the hair has more short hair than long.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even use them for the haircut I need to do because the hair is completely layered already.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my 11yr old who likes to do hair.</li>
      <li>These are not meant for professional hairstylists.</li>
      <li>, when you buy 18 inches of mannequin hair so that you can get as much practice as possible, you expect 18 inches of hair.&lt;br /&gt;12</li>
      <li>My 13 year old wanted this for Christmas.</li>
      <li>This head is still good for hair cutting though.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok but the hair is way to thin and kinda stringy.</li>
      <li>It curls great, holds water well for wet sets, and pin curls, however trying to fingerwave this head is almost impossible because the hair is sooooo soft</li>
      <li>Hair was soft and long.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this doll I love it. It&#x27;s totally worth it I will definitely buy again!!</li>
    <li> My daughter love it !</li>
    <li> Bought for my niece as a Christmas gift.  I was pleased with it.  She loves it.  I bought 3 different manikins so my daughter and nieces could share practicing on different lengths and textures.  The Yolanda is my favorite because it is the most realistic for their hair but I am pleased with this one as well.  All of them shed but, all hair sheds, even the hair on your own head!</li>
    <li> Awful f I do a hair cut I would have to cut at leat 7 inches and then would be too short  because the hair has more short hair than long. Lots of short hair flying around. I really wish I can return I really dislike this product plus the hair is really thin. I can even do hair do on the manique. And that was the purpose that I bought for. Really disappointed</li>
    <li> My daughter never put it down!!  Best gift ever!!!</li>
    <li> This was ok but don&#x27;t like that the hair is very thin</li>
    <li> perfect for my daughter to practice</li>
    <li> My Granddaughter seemed to like it, haven&#x27;t seen or spoke to her since then but apparently no news is good news!</li>
    <li> Mannequin clean &amp; in good condition. Hair much shorter than photo shows. Probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> if I could give this product a zero I would it came on time but the hair is very processed not very human hair pretty disappointed</li>
    <li> Doll head came out good. Hair was soft and long. Just the right amount!</li>
    <li> Meh… Again, the hair is rather thin, but still it should work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetology student. This is a. not 19&amp;#34; hair, it was barely 2 1/2&amp;#34; past the neck and b. the hair melted to my curling iron while on a low heat setting, leading me to believe that it is clearly not 100% human hair. I would not suggest purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> We found these a lot cheaper thru amazon than a beauty supply. The face is not as nice but the hair is great.</li>
    <li> Arrived in two days. Hair quality is really nice. I washed her hair and it didnt tangle at all i was very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Bought it for my daughter its perfect the hair is soft and full well worth the money better  buy then barbie mannequin head</li>
    <li> Wife said it was good</li>
    <li> Very nice mannequin head</li>
    <li> Isnt what i expect :(((</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 11yr old who likes to do hair. It&#x27;s ok but the hair is way to thin and kinda stringy. Will probably end up getting her a better one of better quality later. Kool for kids not for students.</li>
    <li> Applied bleach to it just the way I do to my clients and 5 mins later the hair starts to smoke and it got really hot. I am assuming this hair was colored with henna or something that had metals in it!</li>
    <li> Came a few days early. Hair is ok, mininal shedding. Hair is a little thin but ok for what I needed it for.</li>
    <li> I needed it to take state boards and they are great! I was not disappointed. They do a great job!</li>
    <li> She is ok, the hair lays nice and for teaching she works well. The color was nice and easy to recolor.</li>
    <li> Disgusting. The hair is so coarse and uncooperative. It does not blow dry nice either. Im not shocked, you get what you pay for. This is definitely a mannequin that you get if you&#x27;re planning on cutting it pretty short.</li>
    <li> Thin, short hair. Not what I was expecting. Could have gotten a doll at Sally&#x27;s with double the hair and for less money. Pretty disappointing.</li>
    <li> We have only had this for a few days so can&#x27;t rate how well this mannequin holds up after a lot of use but so far my daughter who is 18, finishing up her senior year of high school, and going into cosmetology loves it. She has been styling the hair but has not tried to curl it with curlers or irons yet. Anyway, it is great for learning to style and braid and I&#x27;m sure it will be great for practicing curls and other hairstyles. It is great to learn up-dos, etc... I would recommend it and it was a great price. I don&#x27;t think the hair is too thin as I have read in a few posts and the face it fine. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Good for cutting practice, roller set practice and curling but the quality of the hair is not so great and the length was not the same all the way around and that&#x27;s about it</li>
    <li> I must admit that I was a little skeptical about the manikin head, but alls well, ends well. It can in the mail and the next day I took it to school everybody asked where you get your manikin from? The hair is super soft and real. It&#x27;s not synthetic blend, it&#x27;s 100% human hair. It curls great, holds water well for wet sets, and pin curls, however trying to fingerwave this head is almost impossible because the hair is sooooo soft it doesnt hold the wave pattern at all. So if your practicing thermal curling, wet sets like pin curl, roller setting, and styling and up do&#x27;s along with color processing this is great, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for finger waving lol. But it&#x27;s still worth purchasing</li>
    <li> Got for grandaughter for Christmas as she loves to do my hair. She is 9 and I wanted something that was more than doll hair. This fit the bill...she really likes it and plays with it for hours.</li>
    <li> I know mannequin hair is not great, but these were really not great. I can&#x27;t even use them for the haircut I need to do because the hair is completely layered already. The crown area is so short.</li>
    <li> This hair was horrible, it shedded so much that left pretty much nothing too work with, I had to go to Sally&#x27;s and get something different to work with. Plz don&#x27;t waste your money!  So disappointed</li>
    <li> I was excited when I  made the purchase, because the description said 100% real hair but it turned out to be synthetic hair. This head is still good for hair cutting though.</li>
    <li> good when running hand through but otherwise started shedding when I brushed it otherwise when I flat iron it , it was great didn&#x27;t melt however I haven&#x27;t tried using the curling wand yet</li>
    <li> I ordered Tina for the hair cutting portion of my state board exams.  She did just fine.  She does have a window&#x27;s peak so I don&#x27;t recommend her for the thermal practical portion of state board.  Her hair does not lay right for the thermal.</li>
    <li> The hair comes out easily and it is very straggly.  Would spend a few more dollars and get a better head next time.</li>
    <li> good hair texture for fingerwaves wet sets ect</li>
    <li> Ordered for a class and met all my needs. I will def order them again!</li>
    <li> This was perfect for me test! And the hair is long which is really nice. And it&#x27;s at a great price. Most of them are $50 to $100.</li>
    <li> no really as I have hope for the hair is thin and hard to work with. For the money it&#x27;s what you can expect.</li>
    <li> Worked fine for teaching class.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my state board. worked fine, but the hair doesn&#x27;t hold moisture.</li>
    <li> Good price and was exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Good price and good quality</li>
    <li> Product not as described.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it! Now she can practice her passion.</li>
    <li> The hair is only 12 inches long and I&#x27;m very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Hair is not as long as expected. Also very thin!!</li>
    <li> These are not meant for professional hairstylists. The quality was really bad</li>
    <li> Hair on the crown is quit thick compared with hair in the back of the head.</li>
    <li> I have ordered two of these. The first one ordered 11/14 was great, very consistent in length, good texture and smooth hair. The second one I just got is absolute crap. It&#x27;s a totally different color and most of the &amp;#34;length&amp;#34; is a random tail.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter in cosmetology school. She said it was hard to work with and low quality compared to other ones she has had. Now we just go to Sally&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> My doll was horrible I was going to use it for state board, it came in a week before I went so I had to go buy another doll from cosmoprof. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone buy this doll head.</li>
    <li> This mannequin head is great her hair is long and really soft.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel like real hair at all.</li>
    <li> My 13 year old wanted this for Christmas. I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I received this. She loves it. Great quality.</li>
    <li> Great for my because I am in school and didnt want to spend $80+ on a mannequin I am going to cut up.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter, who needed another mannequin head for beauty school. She&#x27;s very happy with the quality of the head in general and the hair in particular.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves it.  It was a Christmas and when she opened the gift she screamed with excitement and practices different hair styles. She&#x27;s 10 years old and getting ideas on styling her own hair</li>
    <li> amazing product to work with all your hair styling skills!!</li>
    <li> Good quality hair, good for cutting</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I&#x27;ve recently become interested in hair/hairstyling. I&#x27;m not the most experienced w/ these type items but I feel like it is pretty good.</li>
    <li> These doll heads hair is real human hair good quality and overall are excellent to work with.</li>
    <li> This worked very well for my wife who is in cosmetology, it came in fast and did a get job for her.</li>
    <li> The hair was not as long as it looks in the picture it was at about neck area</li>
    <li> As described, daughter took her State Board test with this item and passed with no issues</li>
    <li> I ordered her last Wednesday and the estimated arrival date was the 5th but it came really almost a week earlier :) I was very happy with that. The hair is really soft and takes to an iron pretty well. The only complaint I have is that the hair is not 18-19&amp;#34; long. At most it&#x27;s 10&amp;#34;. Other than that good product.</li>
    <li> The mannequin had no hair.. It was almost bald and the ends looked like damaged, over processed hair</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these mannequins for state board and practice, and let me start by saying that the quality of the hair is exceptional. 100% human, natural growth pattern, doesn&#x27;t get matted easily when rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;however, when you buy 18 inches of mannequin hair so that you can get as much practice as possible, you expect 18 inches of hair.&lt;br /&gt;12 inches, tops. and half of the hair was stringy and a couple of inches longer than the mass of it. the actual CLEAN length is no longer than 9 inches.&lt;br /&gt;hey, it&#x27;ll get you through boards. but if you wanna practice a long updo look elsewhere. would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Arrived good, good quality. But the Bluetooth were not working</li>
    <li> Awesome mannequin head and two day shipping made it even better!! :)</li>
    <li> This was perfect for my state boards! It was delivered exactly when it was advertised which was great!!  Even better quality than the more expensive ones you get at beauty supply stores!</li>
