      <li>I love that it is organic and fair trade</li>
      <li>so if you like to grind your own beans this is not the coffee for you.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m still in search for an organic coffee that tastes more like my beloved dunkin.</li>
      <li>A nice strong flavor to start your day!</li>
      <li>It has a good, strong flavor</li>
      <li>plus it&#x27;s a very very good high end  </li>

      <li>and I love that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
      <li>Love my coffee.</li>
      <li>I love this coffee - I like a more robust/strong taste from my coffee</li>
      <li>We love the flavor of this coffee</li>
      <li>but this one was way better.</li>
      <li>Even better, its organic and shade grown so it is better for the environment.</li>
      <li>This is definitely the best tasting coffee ever.</li>
      <li>I have been trying different organic coffees and this one is OK but not the best I have had.</li>
      <li>Great favor!  not bitter or to strong.</li>
      <li>Great tasting Coffee, naturally grown.</li>
      <li>Smooth nice flavor, no bad after bite/taste.  </li>
      <li>It has a balanced rich flavor, without the acidity that most coffees have.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
      <li>I love the flavor of bold, strong coffee</li>
      <li>I like strong flavor and light roasted coffees.</li>
      <li>-  breakfast blend is quite robust &amp; delicious  -  these pkgs as w/many are not a full lb  </li>
      <li>very good in taste but too rough ground</li>
      <li>It had a great flavor, which is what I&#x27;m looking for, especially in an organic coffee.</li>
      <li>tastes rich but smooth.</li>
      <li>I actually have 2 bags delivered monthly via subscribe &amp; save, making this a good value, too.</li>
      <li>It gives me good, efficient energy without the highs and lows of traditional coffee.</li>
      <li>It is not bad, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very good, not strong.  </li>
      <li>Seller was quick to ship.</li>
      <li>mild taste with no stomach irritation</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t as complex as, say, the Marley coffee lines, but it is a great one to share with family &amp; friends, as not everyone appreciates the intricacies of some of our more robust flavors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>rogers family does more then just put on a usda seal, I droped my walmart brand coffee and decided to pay a bit more for this stuff since the people who make this coffee actually care about the people who make it.</li>
      <li>This is tasty and not 100% mild.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to have one less thing to remember.</li>
      <li>Never bitter, just good, straight up coffee.</li>
      <li>Little strong;  not as good as Jo.</li>
      <li>My favorite Organic Coffee so far!</li>
      <li>My husband used to drink Folgers, because it was cheap at the store, and he didn&#x27;t really care about the quality of flavor with his coffee.</li>
      <li>I never run out, it&#x27;s always fresh.</li>
      <li>Mine was definitely as fresh as I would get in any grocery.</li>
      <li>It is always fresh tasting, even when the bags have been stored for a couple of weeks.  </li>
      <li>If you are a dark roast lover, you might find it slightly light but satisfied our taste.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Then first bought it at the store but they are way too inconsistent about stocking it.</li>
      <li>It tastes like flavored water so if you enjoy a full bodied cup of coffee, this is definitely not the coffee for you.  </li>
      <li>This is a good, solid blend for our daily coffee uses.</li>
      <li>Coffee is one of the more pesticide products, and non-organic coffee is directly responsible for the destruction of the rain forest and countless species and habitat.</li>
      <li>I like they stand for which pure organic coffee.</li>
      <li>Overall I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for organic coffee that&#x27;s not too expensive.</li>
      <li>But I couldn&#x27;t stand drinking that stuff, and went on a search for a flavorful, organic coffee for a decent price.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this organic coffee.</li>
      <li>As a coffee enthusiast I highly recommend giving this brand a try.</li>
      <li>This a medium roast coffee tasting slightly bitter than light roast.</li>
      <li>Usually the taste is better too.</li>
      <li>my bag is clearly marked USDA Organic and says the ingredient is &amp;#34;Arabica Organic Coffee&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I prefer somewhat mellower coffees as super dark acidic coffees upset my stomach.</li>
      <li>It has a smooth taste, not too strong or bitter, and not too weak.</li>
      <li>I try to choose organic products when possible even though they usually cost more.</li>
      <li>my natural Dr muscle tested me and this is one of the only coffee&#x27;s  that people with kidney meridian issues can drink.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A nice strong flavor to start your day!</li>
    <li> I love the flavor of bold, strong coffee so I wish the other reviews had been there before I tried this coffee and I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it.  It tastes like flavored water so if you enjoy a full bodied cup of coffee, this is definitely not the coffee for you.  However if you&#x27;re looking for a very weak, mild coffee then this is your choice.</li>
    <li> I try to choose organic products when possible even though they usually cost more. Usually the taste is better too. However, this coffee tastes about the same as any brand coffee.</li>
    <li> a bit bitter for my taste</li>
    <li> very good in taste but too rough ground</li>
    <li> Very good coffee, and it arrived to my mother on time.</li>
    <li> This coffee is smooth and has a great flavor. I highly recommend this organic coffee.</li>
    <li> Good product.  I make my bullet proof coffee with it.</li>
    <li> Great tasting Coffee, naturally grown. As a coffee enthusiast I highly recommend giving this brand a try.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try an organic breakfast coffee and I&#x27;ve definitely found it. Great price and great taste. Very smooth and tasty. Definitely happy with this product and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> my natural Dr muscle tested me and this is one of the only coffee&#x27;s  that people with kidney meridian issues can drink. plus it&#x27;s a very very good high end  coffee.if I drink different coffee I lose energy.</li>
    <li> We love the flavor of this coffee and I love that it&#x27;s organic. My only complaint is that the resealable sticker is not very helpful, so I store the grounds in a jar in a dark, cool cabinet. Overall I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for organic coffee that&#x27;s not too expensive. UPDATE: We switched to a cheaper organic coffee to save money, but after a few months we switched back to this brand. You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Never bitter, just good, straight up coffee. Freezes well, I get it delivered  at a discount from amazon on a semi monthly basis. I never run out, it&#x27;s always fresh. It&#x27;s great to have one less thing to remember. Yeah subscribe and save program!</li>
    <li> Really good. I like strong flavor and light roasted coffees. This is tasty and not 100% mild. Will be buying again. Makes a happy cup. Thank you</li>
    <li> Great tasting coffee. My husband used to drink Folgers, because it was cheap at the store, and he didn&#x27;t really care about the quality of flavor with his coffee. But I couldn&#x27;t stand drinking that stuff, and went on a search for a flavorful, organic coffee for a decent price. After trying numerous brands and flavors, I settled for this one. And I am happy to say that the man says he enjoys the taste of it.</li>
    <li> Love this coffee! No chemicals is best of all. It&#x27;s a great morning coffee to start off your day. I used to get horrible stomach aches from other coffee&#x27;s but not with this organic coffee.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no coffee expert, but I like the flavor as well as the fact that it&#x27;s organic. This is now the coffee that Amazon sends me every few months.</li>
    <li> My husband and I are hooked on this coffee from The Organic Coffee.  It has a balanced rich flavor, without the acidity that most coffees have.  Have purchased over a dozen bags, and will continue to be a customer.  It is always fresh tasting, even when the bags have been stored for a couple of weeks.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Love that this product is organic and fair trade!</li>
    <li> great tasting coffee. Definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Flavor is off from what i had hoped. It&#x27;s good, just not quite what I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
    <li> This makes a great cup of coffee.  Take note that this is ground coffee so if you like to grind your own beans this is not the coffee for you.</li>
    <li> tastes rich but smooth. If you are a dark roast lover, you might find it slightly light but satisfied our taste.</li>
    <li> I am writing this review because this is the review I wish someone had wrote. I don&#x27;t like this coffee, I&#x27;m a dunkin donuts girl, and it does not agree with my palate. My husband, however, enjoys Starbucks and doesn&#x27;t mind this coffee, I will also note that he is not picky when it comes to coffee. I love that it is organic and fair trade but I&#x27;m still in search for an organic coffee that tastes more like my beloved dunkin.</li>
    <li> Tried this as my family tries to move toward healthier choices.  Love my coffee. This has a stronger taste than Folgers or Community...I think only because it is organic, and I will adjust to that.  Great price comparatively.  Seller was quick to ship.</li>
    <li> After taste testing multiple coffees through Amazon, I liked this one the best.  Smooth nice flavor, no bad after bite/taste.  Being organic is just a bonus.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> mild taste with no stomach irritation</li>
    <li> I usually drink their vanilla flavored but changed over to just plain regular coffee ... I like it plain and simple.  I like they stand for which pure organic coffee.</li>
    <li> This is a great morning coffee. It has a smooth taste, not too strong or bitter, and not too weak.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an average coffee. I will pry not be buying this again as it is somewhat bitter, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This breakfast blend tastes great! It came just as described.  You can&#x27;t beat the price for organic coffee anywhere. Thanks!</li>
    <li> My daughter-in-law bought me this coffee for Christmas this year.  It&#x27;s very good, not strong.  We used to buy the beans but now buy it for our Keurig coffee maker.  It&#x27;s costs a lot less to purchase the ground coffee than buying the K-cups and the coffee is just as good!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best coffees I have bought from Amazon. Great favor!  not bitter or to strong.</li>
    <li> I have been trying different organic coffees and this one is OK but not the best I have had.</li>
    <li> too bitter for my taste and bland</li>
    <li> I have this coffee delivered every month and have for about a year. I love the bold taste  One of the best in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this coffee! It&#x27;s a bit expensive on amazon. I can get the same size bag for 7.99 at my local grocery store. But it has a very smooth taste and it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
    <li> I love this coffee - I like a more robust/strong taste from my coffee and this brand has it - taste very good</li>
    <li> Little strong;  not as good as Jo.</li>
    <li> rather expensive but organic coffee is well worth th price  -  breakfast blend is quite robust &amp; delicious  -  these pkgs as w/many are not a full lb  -  they are abt 13ozs</li>
    <li> I love this coffee! It has a great, smooth flavor and a wonderful aroma. Even better, its organic and shade grown so it is better for the environment. And the programs this company supports in its coffee growing communities make it a great company to do business with!</li>
    <li> rogers family does more then just put on a usda seal, I droped my walmart brand coffee and decided to pay a bit more for this stuff since the people who make this coffee actually care about the people who make it.</li>
    <li> I am so picky about my coffee. Bought this &amp;#34;Rainbow Blend&amp;#34; in other brands but this one was way better. Then first bought it at the store but they are way too inconsistent about stocking it. So I have it in my subscribe n save now. This is definitely the best tasting coffee ever.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I automatically assumed that all Breakfast Blend coffees are light roast. It was not the case. This a medium roast coffee tasting slightly bitter than light roast. I guess I should have read the Q&amp;A&#x27;s before purchasing. It is not bad, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> Great tasting coffee. I bought a coffee grinder, so now buying beans, but would otherwise recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a good, solid blend for our daily coffee uses. I actually have 2 bags delivered monthly via subscribe &amp; save, making this a good value, too. It has a good, strong flavor and I prefer organic for all our coffee needs... and believe me, we NEED our coffee! This isn&#x27;t as complex as, say, the Marley coffee lines, but it is a great one to share with family &amp; friends, as not everyone appreciates the intricacies of some of our more robust flavors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Pictures added for someone asking if it was indeed organic... my bag is clearly marked USDA Organic and says the ingredient is &amp;#34;Arabica Organic Coffee&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> My favorite Organic Coffee so far!</li>
    <li> Great tasting coffee. Mine was definitely as fresh as I would get in any grocery. It has a great flavor. I prefer somewhat mellower coffees as super dark acidic coffees upset my stomach. This coffee is an easy drink for me, making my necessary caffeine intake pleasurable instead of a difficult chore with a post-consumption regret as queasiness sets in. Maybe it&#x27;s also because this coffee is not tainted by pesticides? Coffee is one of the more pesticide products, and non-organic coffee is directly responsible for the destruction of the rain forest and countless species and habitat. I will likely purchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> It had a great flavor, which is what I&#x27;m looking for, especially in an organic coffee. It gives me good, efficient energy without the highs and lows of traditional coffee. Will definitely reorder</li>
