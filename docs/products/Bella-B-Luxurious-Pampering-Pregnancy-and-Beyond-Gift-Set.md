      <li>I am really happy with the product, it was exactly what I was looking for when I needed a gift for an expectant mother.</li>

      <li>Love the honey butter for keeping away stretch marks.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>so I ended up having to spend more money because I needed gift wrapping materials.</li>
      <li>Love this</li>
      <li>and so glad I did.</li>
      <li>I researched items along this line and found that Bella B Pregnancy and Beyond was a top rated product.  </li>
      <li>-The lotion in this set is very nice, smells fresh, and helps keep your ever-growing pregnant belly and body moist.    </li>
      <li>Good price, fast, safe</li>
      <li>Packaging and assortment of products is perfect, sizes generous enough to keep it from looking cheap.</li>
      <li>-The bath salts are very nice for a pregnant woman who wants to bathe and relax without the risk of chemicals.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I am happy I purchased this, I just wish it was wrapped better.</li>
      <li>I started with all three of these to see if I liked the products first</li>
      <li>It is not harsh on the body, pleasant and soothing for baby as well.  </li>
      <li>Our daughter really liked and appreciated this gift.  </li>
      <li>I like the smell (light) and taking a bath with them</li>
      <li>Quick, easy, not sticky.</li>
      <li>Heard about it from niece 5 hrs ago, have found that many newly expecting moms(dad&#x27;s too) just love it.</li>
      <li>I love all of it so much I got the baby bath products for when our baby needs a bath!</li>
      <li>The young woman who received it liked it.</li>
      <li>The belly butter is its pretty greasy, but I think it feels good on my big belly at night!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure if the butter actually worked or if it is genetics...</li>
      <li>Much appreciated!</li>
      <li>She was a first time mom-to-be.  </li>
      <li>It is very greasy and sticks to your clothing.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really works...</li>
      <li>I found the tummy butter to be very sticky and the smell was too floral for me.</li>
      <li>It must go fast, I sent it to her a month ago</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have oilier skin naturally and found myself applying alot to really feel well</li>
      <li>far i think they are very moisture.</li>
      <li>Only down side is that its in a tub, the stick works way better, but this is at least a good way to start trying the product.</li>
      <li>I like to give them outside of a shower time or anything, preferring those early heady days right after you&#x27;ve received the verifiable news, wanting to shout it from rooftops, but knowing the old wives&#x27;tales about saying too much before a 3 month mark.  </li>
      <li>Bella B is practical and a must have for new moms.  </li>
      <li>As a grandmother, I appreciate that it&#x27;s a gift that doesn&#x27;t look like it came from an old lady!  </li>
      <li>Its not the end of the world, but yellow stains aren&#x27;t pretty to look at.    </li>
      <li>However, it was a gift and when I received it, the packaging was torn, the gift was apart, and the second item in the box was a book which was stuck to a huge pink sticker on the packaging.  </li>
      <li>I have zero stretch marks (so far)</li>
      <li>Works wonders for soft and supple skin after birth.</li>
      <li>If your an expecting mother tell your baby daddy to buy this early so you can start prepping the stretch mark zones.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my wife for a mothers day present since we are expecting our first child later this year.  </li>
      <li>the new mom can&#x27;t thank me enough!  </li>
      <li>That being said, I used it about once a week in my first and second trimesters, and almost daily in my third trimester.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t attest to the other products in this bag, because why on earth would we use them after the tom foolery that resulted from using the first two??</li>
      <li>I was over 30 and pregnant and used this everyday!  </li>
      <li>one of the biggest reasons I haven&#x27;t used other brands is because the scent is too much.</li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s hard to shop for pregnant lovers, but keep looking, because this one is a dud.</li>
      <li>I bought this set because I got a few stretch marks early in pregnancy but was very sensitive to smells.  </li>

<li> -The Butter is NASTY to put on.  </li>
<li> The balm is terrible.</li>

    <li> -The lotion in this set is very nice, smells fresh, and helps keep your ever-growing pregnant belly and body moist.    -The bath salts are very nice for a pregnant woman who wants to bathe and relax without the risk of chemicals.  However, I use a plush bath pillow that is now stained permanently yellow from these salts.  Its not the end of the world, but yellow stains aren&#x27;t pretty to look at.    -The Butter is NASTY to put on.  It is very greasy and sticks to your clothing.  That being said, I used it about once a week in my first and second trimesters, and almost daily in my third trimester.  In the end, I have no stretch marks whatsoever.  I can&#x27;t say for sure if the butter actually worked or if it is genetics... but I will probably use this next time too just in case!</li>
    <li> Good price, fast, safe</li>
    <li> Bella B is practical and a must have for new moms.  Bought this as a gift and the new mom can&#x27;t thank me enough!  It is not harsh on the body, pleasant and soothing for baby as well.  Works wonders for soft and supple skin after birth.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my best friend that is having a baby. She said she loves the smell and has enjoyed all of the products!</li>

    <li> This stuff really works...I was over 30 and pregnant and used this everyday!  NO STRETCH MARKS!  And it stopped my stomach from itching all the time!  Love this, I recommend it 100%!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for a mothers day present since we are expecting our first child later this year.  My wife loves it and if your a guy it will score you some points.  If your an expecting mother tell your baby daddy to buy this early so you can start prepping the stretch mark zones.  :)</li>
    <li> Beautifully packaged gift for the &#x27;Mither-to-be&#x27; as a special treat for HER</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter in law and she couldn&#x27;t wait to try everything!  Cute packaging too!</li>
    <li> My company bought this gift set for our estimator who left on maternity leave. She said she loved it! SHe used the lotion as soon as she got it. However, she didn&#x27;t know who the gift was from, as there was no card (none was offered) or return address on the item. It was a small hiccup though. The product was great.</li>
    <li> i love the smell.the cream is great and dont feel oily.i also use the butter after the cream.so far i think they are very moisture.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with the product, it was exactly what I was looking for when I needed a gift for an expectant mother. But the packaging was ripped when I opened the box so I ended up having to spend more money because I needed gift wrapping materials. Overall, I am happy I purchased this, I just wish it was wrapped better.</li>
    <li> Great gift.  Much appreciated!</li>
    <li> My husband got this for me for a gift, and I can safely sat that all of the products in this gift set are wonderful! Everything smells SO good. I am now 35 weeks along and have been using all of it. I have zero stretch marks (so far) and I have been using the belly butter every night. The bath fizz is great for all my sore muscles, and the lotion smells great and is not greasy. The belly butter is its pretty greasy, but I think it feels good on my big belly at night! I love all of it so much I got the baby bath products for when our baby needs a bath!</li>
    <li> -The lotion is great, a nice light smell. It is not super moisturizing though. I have oilier skin naturally and found myself applying alot to really feel well moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The bath salts were amazing - I used them up quickly and am hoping someone buys me more! I like the smell (light) and taking a bath with them felt extra relaxing - I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The balm is terrible. I used it for a few weeks day and night, and ended up with pimples/clogged pores on my stomach, so I stopped using. It is greasy and does not absorb well into my skin. I just use regular heavy duty lotion now and that seems to work well so far.</li>
    <li> This was a gift, but the gift-ee says that she likes it. It must go fast, I sent it to her a month ago and she says she&#x27;s already out of some of the products.</li>
    <li> Heard about it from niece 5 hrs ago, have found that many newly expecting moms(dad&#x27;s too) just love it. Packaging and assortment of products is perfect, sizes generous enough to keep it from looking cheap. I like to give them outside of a shower time or anything, preferring those early heady days right after you&#x27;ve received the verifiable news, wanting to shout it from rooftops, but knowing the old wives&#x27;tales about saying too much before a 3 month mark.  As a grandmother, I appreciate that it&#x27;s a gift that doesn&#x27;t look like it came from an old lady!  And of course, the stretchmark moisturizing stick is just the greatest for myself. Quick, easy, not sticky.</li>
    <li> This is a great gift in theory. IN THEORY. But in theory, communism works. The cream gave my wife a terrible rash that lasted a week, and the bath powder stained our tub yellow. I can&#x27;t attest to the other products in this bag, because why on earth would we use them after the tom foolery that resulted from using the first two?? I know it&#x27;s hard to shop for pregnant lovers, but keep looking, because this one is a dud.</li>
    <li> The product I received was wonderful, my daughter loves it.  However, it was a gift and when I received it, the packaging was torn, the gift was apart, and the second item in the box was a book which was stuck to a huge pink sticker on the packaging.  When I tried to remove the sticker, it bent the book cover and left a mass of sticky glue on the back of the gift packaging.  Very disappointing, but no time to return. :(</li>
    <li> I got two of these. One had a torn package! As a gift I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this set because I got a few stretch marks early in pregnancy but was very sensitive to smells.  The honey scent is light and really pleasant.  The Mama Soak has been a lifesaver for sore hips, calves, and swollen ankles/feet.  Love the honey butter for keeping away stretch marks.  The silk and honey lotion is awesome for itchy skin.</li>
    <li> love this gift pack! I started with all three of these to see if I liked the products first and so glad I did. The lotion is a great additive with the prevention tummy butter. All the products have a very light scent that smells great! one of the biggest reasons I haven&#x27;t used other brands is because the scent is too much. I feel like the tummy butter lasts all day too! Only down side is that its in a tub, the stick works way better, but this is at least a good way to start trying the product. great gift for newly pregnant friends/ family!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how good this product is, I gave it as a gift. The young woman who received it liked it. She hasn&#x27;t told us how it works yet.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful gift for mommy to be! AWESOME!</li>
    <li> It was presented as a gift for my sister and she loves all of the items.</li>
