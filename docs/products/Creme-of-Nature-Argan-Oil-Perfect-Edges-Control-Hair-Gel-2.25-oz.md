<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells good. Product actually works for my hair. Moisturizes it, not greasy. Shipping was alright. I recommend buying from this seller.</li>
    <li> It really is good. I use this for my ponytails. Yeah it usually does the job. I use it with a bit of oil and it makes my hair a bit softer. Doesn&#x27;t make it crunchy or flaky. Really amazing stuff.</li>
    <li> I have used keracares edge tamer and I absolutley hated it. It was nice when first applied, but wouldn&#x27;t last all day. Plus, it left a residue with white flakiness although the product is clear....But this right HERE? the cream of nature is great for holding my edges (my hair is 3c/4a). This product doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or oily residue, it holds all day for me, and you can re-apply it everyday without flakes. Doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair either. This is my favorite product and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Good for natural styles to get straighter edges. Non flaky or greasy and only takes a little. Its Good stuff!</li>
    <li> This product is great. It has been so hard for me to find a good edge gel. And its inexpensive. It would definitely recommend it but 1 thing to note is don&#x27;t leave it open because it changes the consistency.</li>
    <li> I HAVE been natural a little over a year and I still have little permd ends so I have a sew in with some of my hair out. I USE the edge control on my edges to keep me from flat ironing them out and burning them off. TRUST this product is Great for slicking down those edges but my only problem is soon as I hit the door my hair curls up!  Im Goin to try applying the gel and wrapping my edges in a scarf to see if I can get a longer hold! other then that this is the 1st and bound to be last product I use for my edges</li>
    <li> It smells nice and has decent hold, but often flakes up - which is why I rated it a 2.  I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase because at least I know; however, I prefer Hicks Edges because of the great hold, nice, light scent and I don&#x27;t experience any flaking at all.</li>
    <li> Loved the product. Not expensive give u what u have asked for. The best product by far. Thank u very much.</li>
    <li> The BEST edge control I have ever used.. Does not flake or harden hair. Doesnt really leave a greasy residue either. My edges remain straight and I haven&#x27;t had a relaxer in almost 4-5 months.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product and as soon as I applied it in my hair it gave my hair the strongest and cleanest hold ever !!! I love it and highly recommend it !!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this from Amazon, but I&#x27;ve found it in my local beauty stores for about $5. I usually only use a very small amount on my hairline around my ears to tame some fly away pieces &amp; it seem to do pretty good, but recently I used more of the product to slick all of my hair back in a ponytail &amp; it did really well! It held my hair down all day &amp; even the next morning after wrapping it with a scarf, it was still in tack. There also was no white residue like some product will leave behind. It didn&#x27;t leave my hair hard or stiff-I was able to run my comb thru it the next morning. This stuff is awesome! I like all of the Creme of Nature products &amp; I&#x27;m happy that the prices are reasonable &amp; you can find them in your local beauty stores!!!</li>
    <li> If your hair is relaxed I think it will definitely work better, my hair is natural and it doesn&#x27;t really lay my edges down that well, but it&#x27;s good enough since my edges aren&#x27;t that crazy out of control lol</li>
    <li> Doesnt hold on natural hair.</li>
    <li> I like this, but for maximum hold, I have to use it with gel.</li>
    <li> This product works great to smooth edges on any hair type.  I am wearing my hair natural and this gel holds my edges very well.  I dampen my edges, apply this gel (you don&#x27;t need a lot),  seal it with eco-styler gel, then tie the edges down until it dries or use a blow dryer if you can&#x27;t wait for your hair to air dry.  I recommend this gel for Black women who are transitioning to natural as well as those who are already sporting the natural look.  The price is great so don&#x27;t hesitate to buy more than one jar at a time but one jar can last at least a month if you don&#x27;t use too much.  A little does go a long way.</li>
    <li> Great product. My edges have never been this tamed before!</li>
    <li> When it dries off, it  turns starchy white.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all. I hate it!!</li>
    <li> This product holds my hair in place perfectly. I wear hats majority of the time, and every time i take off my hat my hair moves out of place, but with this perfect edge gel my edges never move. This product works even better on women, my girlfriend uses it more than i do and it keeps her hair in place until she goes to the gym and sweats it out.</li>
    <li> I combined my Eco styler gel and this when I do my afro puffs. I have 4c hair and my technique works well. I really like this edge control because it doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue like the other kinds. And it smells great. It works good for the price.</li>
    <li> This is about the only products that holds my edges down for 2 mins most products dont do that for me lol i wish it had a stronger hold but this is the only one that works for me</li>
    <li> Perfect Edges!? Most definitely! I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m just now hearing about this product! I wear extensions and I am an African American with natural hair, and this products lays down my edges amazingly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it all of the time because I have to keep my hair down for my job. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Yesssss finally a product that give me the hold I need without the crunch and flakes. But it doesn&#x27;t last alll day unless you apply it again later in the day. But a little goes a long way with this product and I love it.</li>
    <li> This worked out good enough.  Especially if you put it on the edges, tie up with a scarf for a few hours or overnight.</li>
    <li> I love this edge control. It works perfectly and stays on all day. I&#x27;d say you would have to wash it out every 3 days so you don&#x27;t get build up.</li>
    <li> Very good product and packaged well.</li>
    <li> I bought 5 jars when it first came out because I lovvvvved how it was just as the name said perfect for me.  my hair is cotton ball soft and it was gave me the exact look I wanted without being cake or easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my 5 jars ran out I bought 2 more jars and it simply didn&#x27;t work.  I bought another jar from a different store in a different city and sure enough the formula has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was their BIGGEST fan and now can&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it it no longer works...no Perfect anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other edge control products that flake and end up making my hair look dry so I was skeptical about this one. However, This one makes my hair look shiny, feel moisturized and definitely doesn&#x27;t flake You can&#x27;t beat the price, I found similar edge control products at Sephora for much more.. I only wish it would hold my edges all day.</li>
    <li> Works nicely.  Little build up. Does have a smell that is actually not bad at all.  I have tried others.  This is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I guess this product either works for your hair or doesn&#x27;t. My hair texture is naturally curly so I used it for my edges. It was slick and fine for a few hours and then turned white, flaky, and sticky. I could not even comb through my hair. I think it just depends on the persons hair type.</li>
    <li> Does not work well with my hair type</li>
    <li> It does exactly what I need it to do which is lay down my edges; I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This product is really great for the hair. Not greasy at all. Keeps the hair in place for a long time.</li>
    <li> It really did control my edges but after a couple of hours I could see some of my hairs sticking up again. It didn&#x27;t bother me much but I have tried a product that, compared to this, lasted a bit longer. Still, it does the job!</li>
    <li> This is the best edge creme I have ever used! I washed my hair &amp; applied this creme to my edges &amp; it stayed in place for several days. It reminds me of a gel, but no flaking or hardness. It is shiny, smooth &amp; makes my edges silky. It had a nice shine to it as well. After the 1st 3 days it began to lose shine but it was still holding my edges in place. I simply sprayed my hair glosser on it &amp; it was back to its original state. On another ocassion, I used it on dry hair &amp; it held just the same. When it lost shine, I simply sprayed my hair glosser again &amp; viola! My edges were like magic! In the past, I have tried several edge cremes &amp; none of them kept my edges in place for a whole day, let alone 5 days! It is not expensive. A little goes a long way, so I&#x27;ll have this jar for a long time which is a plus(-:  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s not bad,  but it doesn&#x27;t hold my edges all day just the first 2 hours than I have to reapply.  For a pro it smells really good.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! It holds my 4b/4c hair so well.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for my edges &amp; hair. I also love the smell. I&#x27;ve tried other edge controls &amp; none comes close to this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times and it does not seem to do the job for me. I&#x27;ll give it a few more tries but would not buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I use this for my edges(of course) and it makes my edges smooth down soo good and it stays that way all day. The texture of this product is not really sticky or oily. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I was told about this product from a friend and purchase it online thru amazon and I would say it work well on my daughter hair not so great on my thick coarse natural edges ( My edges begin to lift up after about a hour after of being flat) ; but if you have relaxed hair  or thin hair this is the product for you ; it will leave your edges looking nicely flat a hair looking finished .it doesn&#x27;t work on all types of hair not longevity.....</li>
    <li> great product on time delivery! I got it sooner than i thought i would i love it! It works so well and provide the smoothest edges better than ever</li>
    <li> Probably the best edge control I tried it hold my edges pretty well and I&#x27;m natural. I&#x27;ve been trying different edge control and none last all day but this one does the job</li>
    <li> it works G R E A T on relaxed hair but does not hold as well on natural hair, on natural hair it will hold for about a half hour</li>
    <li> The only type of edge control I use! Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this gel. It creates a great hold for my edges. Will be buying this product again. Good buy.</li>
    <li> This product gave my edges a sleek shiny look that I never expected, the argon oil maybe the reason.  It is a good product however, I have tried better since I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> Works well to lay edges but is more effective on relaxed rather. Than unprocessed 4c virgin hair. It does produces a little white flakes when dried. The best way to remedy the problem is to mix with just a little oil when applying.</li>
    <li> Works like magic!! I have really kinky hair and this product really does the job of keeping my edges perfectly neat! i love it!</li>
    <li> The packaging:  Perfect hold. exotic shine, and making hair stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So much side eye on this product.  I put a small amount on and at first it looked good then after an hour being in a satin scarf, my edges were not laid.  And, no, I wasn&#x27;t going to cake up my edges to get them to lay down with this product, with my luck I would had got some build up that wouldn&#x27;t been cute.  I will be sticking to eco styler or xtreme gel for my inexpensive gels.</li>
    <li> Please make grease on one, I love this oil too</li>
    <li> Its Healthy and not to harsh on hair, it smells amazing and i will be buying more in the future</li>
    <li> I always use this brand. it works amazingly on my hair! I usually have a hard time laying my edges down, but with this edge control I get a smooth sleek look.</li>
    <li> Leaves an oily residue and my hair was slick down for a short period .I&#x27;m natural so wasn&#x27;t what I needed.</li>
    <li> I put it on in the moringing and the moment I go outside it melts off. It doensn&#x27;t hold my hair at all. I am not buying this again and I don&#x27;t reccommend this crap.</li>
    <li> KEEPS MY FLY AWAYS PUT...</li>
    <li> THE BEST EDGE CONTROL I EVER USED ..IT SMELLS SO GOOD ..I LOVE THIS , I WILL BE ORDERING AGAIN</li>
    <li> It is a good product, it does not leave your hair hard or flaky, but it needs to have a little more hold.</li>
    <li> Works nicely to keep my fly aways at bay. It also&lt;br /&gt;keeps my sides nice and slick with a little wave.&lt;br /&gt;Smells really nice and not overwhelming and does not leave and white residue or build up.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last like the one in the stores I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s different but it works temporarily I&#x27;ve bought this item before in stores and lasted hours not just 20 or 10 minutes</li>
    <li> This is a good hair gel.  It&#x27;s great for those days when you want to wear a ponytail.  It holds well and doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out.  It doesn&#x27;t flake either.  The only negative is that it makes the hair just a little too stiff meaning I can brush my hair with this stuff in it.  This has to be applied last.</li>
    <li> really like this stuff not sticky or heavy does the job. probably won&#x27;t re order there are a few other products i like just a bit better.</li>
    <li> Works good in my hair and it&#x27;s not drying. It has a nice smell and it does&#x27;t leave my hair flakey.</li>
    <li> It lays down your edges AMAZINGLY when you first apply it. But after an hour or so it begins to wear off. It adds shine to your edges. But it becomes greasy after a while. ( It lays them down but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like.)..</li>
    <li> Its okay. My edges wouldn&#x27;t stay down. Soon it put it in my hair gets curly</li>
    <li> Exactly as stated with fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and this one stands out. It does hold my edges down unfortunately only for 15 minutes</li>
    <li> This item is great.  I love the edge control on my hair.  It is not flaky like some other  edge control products.</li>
    <li> Tried this and it does just what it says, controls edges.  It was difficult to find in stores, so unable to say if cost is comparable, but I&#x27;m happy to find it on Amazon and not have to waste time, energy and gas searching several stores.</li>
    <li> I have kinky, curly, coily natural hair. When I pull my hair back, without product, kinky waves form. This product smooths my hair down and almost straightens it out completely. A little definitely goes a long way and make sure to use a brush. This gel does not flake and has a light fragrance. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Its good , its not like other edge controls that leave the white stuff in your hair . But its hold not all night but it last for 6hrs or 7hrs max.</li>
    <li> Ok some people may not believe this but its true in my case. My edges brke off in march due to bad lacefront wigs. I have been using this gel on my edges since april, by june my edges are now back and full. I have a great looking hairline. I am African american and have Natural kinky hair (3b/3c hair). I had a weave installed in april and used edge control to blend and sleek down my edeges. now...whilst edge control does nothing for actual control of my edges because after an hour my edges aren&#x27;t sleek and laying flat anymore LOL. But after just one month of putting it on everyday, The edges which were scanty and patchy grew back. My edges are strong dark and full. My husband couldn&#x27;t believe it. I didn&#x27;t do anything different. I have always taken multivitamins for years so that didn&#x27;;t affect it. Very strange. I have had weaves before and my edges remained the same after taking it out. This april, the only thing I did differently was use the argan oil edge control. Who cares about edge control, now I am using their entire line of products for my hair. I wonder if they will grow the rest of my hair longer LOL. I give it a 4 star because the gel doesn&#x27;t do much for edge control but grew my hair!</li>
    <li> This product is ok, worked fine for my edges and I of course only used a small amount. However when I used it on my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s edges- again VERY small amount, I immediately noticed that it was pulling her hair out. This breakage is VERY noticeable so i would strongly discourage using this product on your child&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after seeing reviews on yt. This is exactly the type of hold I was looking for and I won&#x27;t have to wash my hair immediately after using it. I just want to control my hair, not slick it down. I have used other Creme of Nature Argan Oil products and they have all given me very good results. This gel has the same smell as the Gloss and Shine polisher (which I am in love with).</li>
    <li> Bought this, smells nice but does NOT hold my natural edges. This works well on my friend who perms/relaxes her hair. It also cakes. Too bad.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wonderful for about 15 minutes &amp; then you see the edges sticking up again.</li>
    <li> I am still learning how to use this for my edges but it does well</li>
    <li> Works exactly as expected.  Keeps the edges and short little hairs in place</li>
    <li> Not for my unpermed hair. Get&#x27;s messy fast.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It does not cake and it adds moisture to your hair.</li>
    <li> Worked great for my edges. My edges were slick for a good 7-8 hours. I used this along my edges on clean, damp hair and some good brushing. Got this at Walmart for under 5 bucks and I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Good product. It&#x27;s light and smooth with a gentle fragrance and smoothed my edges without flaking. This product lasts a long time because very little is needed per application.</li>
    <li> Great for smoothing the hairline!</li>
    <li> love this, will be ordering again</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t do anything for a nappy natural girl.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use something to control my edges and thought that this would work but it is really greasy/oily. It smells good but it just didn&#x27;t work for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently it works for others so I wouldn&#x27;t just go off of my review. It&#x27;s always great to try new things and it isn&#x27;t pricey. I would say that if you have thin hair to try it. My hair is pretty coarse and really curly so once the product went on the curls just stuck back up.</li>
    <li> i was excpecting  the same edge control as with Olive oil edge control,this doesnt have hold,its more like the hair product jam and it turnes to oil later in the day,nice for shine but not hold</li>
    <li> I must say I lovee it, it holds my edges down really well all day. There is no flaking and it doesnt take the shine away from my hair. Great buy.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying this product, and I love it. It works great for your hair, if you wear it wet and curly; and also if you wear it blown out straight. It smells great, and is not greasy, flaky, or hard like some gels.</li>
    <li> This is just a greasy wax. It does absolutely nothing for my afro hair. Perhaps its more suitable for straight haired folks.</li>
    <li> This is bay far the best edge control i have ever purchased. Doesnt dry out your hair and it actually lay stuppron hair down! Thank you for doing all that you claim you would do!!</li>
    <li> I picked this up last week after running out of my staple product (Curls Passion Fruit Control Paste), and I was pleasantly surprised. I am natural with coarse, kinky hair and this works really well for me. The key is to not use too much at one time or your hair will be greasy. In addition to using it to slick down my edges, I also use a little on my mini twists once they start to unravel - it provides really good hold. The only downside for me is the smell because it is very strong and takes a while to die down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall for the price and performance, this is a good product that I would be willing to buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this! great for your edges, doesn&#x27;t leave a dry white residue. Makes the hair lay very well and moisturizes at the same time.</li>
    <li> The very best edge control I have ever used, and I have used quite a few on my 4b hair. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Totally saved my edges. You do not even have to straighten and then lay edges down just apply gel to your edges  and take a nice not to soft hair brush and brush down and your hair. The hair  will  lay down nicely this way you are not  heat damaging your edges with the flat iron or big bumpers. This product does not have a greasy look (apply and wipe excess from your sides) it also does not build up on your hair and make it feel all heavy and gross. Make sure you keep the lid on the product or it will look greasy when you apply it to your hair. If you forget to put lid back on just put it in refrigerator not freezer for a few hours it will be like new :)</li>
    <li> You will love this! This edge control gives you the look you want that and it is not hard like gel would be. It does not flake up. You can change your hair style with it because it does not dry hard just natural. You do not need to use a lot just a little bit and it slicks your hair down so good.</li>
    <li> smells very good , looks exactly like the picture , very thick as we&#x27;ll . will purchase again !</li>
    <li> I am a fan of this product. I used it for my edges and they laid nice like a new perm for about three hours or so (I do not have a perm though). Then I needed to apply more. So I do keep this in my purse so I can reapply as needed. It does shine, but doesn&#x27;t flake up like gel does. Out of all the other edge controls that I have tried I do like this one the best.</li>
    <li> works great on edges..</li>
    <li> I really love this edge control.  I&#x27;ve been natural (no perm/chemicals) for over 3 years now and really needed a good product for my edges, especially for when my edges get wet, there&#x27;s a temperature change, or sweating from working out.  I love that this lays my edges and leaves my hair soft and manageable.  There&#x27;s no film or flaky build-up that gels will leave in your hair. It doesn&#x27;t give my hair a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; look.  It just smooth&#x27;s my edges giving them a perm like look when my hair is straight, and also blends in nicely when its curly.  I don&#x27;t feel the need to have to re-apply this edge control in the event I change my hair style.  It also has a great scent to it!  I love it.  It works for me!  I will definitely continue to purchase this edge control.</li>
    <li> Live this Product. Perfect edges. No flaking. Holds up to my wild nights out on the town.</li>
    <li> Good stuff holds edges ,not greasy or waxy</li>
    <li> This is excellent. My hair never takes to any gels or edge tamers but this works for me and I highly recommend this. It also make your hair smell great.</li>
    <li> My hair is really thick. Other edge gels are either sticky or my hair curls up a few hours later. My hair is 3b, Bc and 4a natural so I can use all the help I can get. I have paid up to $25 for some other brands of gels, so to see that this is only $4.00 or so and work just as well I jumped for joy. Give this a try, you won&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
    <li> this product was good for holding my hair in place but only for a about maybe 5 hours....wish the hold was stronger but it added great shine to my hair :) 4 star quality!</li>
    <li> To thick and sticky wear off to fast</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to smooth my naturally curly edges between flat ironing and keratin straightening treatments. The gel did smooth my hair a bit, but the wet consistency caused my hair to curl and revert to its natural state. If you have curly edges that you are trying to keep smooth and straight, this product might not be the best choice for you.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite edge control love the texture got to get myself 1 more.</li>
    <li> It has the best hold out there! And I&#x27;ve tried many other products.  It would have gotten 5 star, but the smell is strong, not offensively strong, but very fruity. It&#x27;s become my absolute go to for all day hold.</li>
    <li> i love this edge control and have reorder it work great for my hair texture good product.. like it..good great</li>
    <li> not greasy, doesn&#x27;t make the hair hard.  doesn&#x27;t dry out the hair. a little goes a long way. pretty good product.</li>
    <li> I started using Creme of Nature Argan Oil Perfect Edges Control Hair Gel. My hair is 100% natural. I have dreadlocks. I woke up one morning and my entire hairline was gone. WARNING!!! DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. I called to file a complaint and I was given the run around by customer service. This product should be taken off that market.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Wal-Mart. I usually do not wear my hair pulled back/in a pony unless it&#x27;s close to wash day. When I do, I always use this to smooth my edges. It does exactly what it says. No hardening, no flakes and my edges are LAID! I love it :)</li>
    <li> I love this product, helps keep stray hairs and edges to lay flat without damaging them, smells nice too and way cheaper than at your beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. This is only the second edge control I’ve tried. Compared to the Olive Oil one, I like this way better. There is no flaking with this product, however beware of a waxy build-up that can happen if you put more than a dab on in one area. On hot and humid days this lasts me most of the day but towards night time it wears off and my edges creep up again! I think I will try Hicks next time, but for the price this one does a great job. It also smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> This product is outstanding! A little goes a long way and this product has my edges sleek and smooth. I no longer need gel for my edges and still get the right look. I will definitely order this again to keep it in rotation.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife because she couldn&#x27;t find it in the city ANYWHERE! She loves it and it makes her hair look soooo nice! :)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I would highly recommended it</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Does what it says!</li>
    <li> When you are natural your edges are also natural, what that mean is once you do your protected style your edge still might look out of place. So you use a edge control to smooth it down and this one works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to everyone to get it.</li>
    <li> I relax my edges every 12 weeks and I, silly me, decided to try this product on the 12th week. I put it on and it could not control my 4a/4b new growth. There was not that much new growth, about an inch and when i slicked it on...all it did was add shine and wave it up. I might as well put some conditioner on my edges and called it a day--same effect. After I put a touch up on my edges, it still wasn&#x27;t good with holding my bone straight leaveout in place after a 12 hour day. My baby hairs lifted and started to move around before the 4th hour came. It&#x27;s just not \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; whatsoever. The only good thing I have to say about it is that it gives a nice little shine. However, I recommend my go-to edge gel/smoother: Silk Elements Straight Edges. Much, much better. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I have experimented with a few edge controls and this is the best thus far. For best results I use a full finger tip size of the product and coat it around the edges first. Then I take a boar brush and brush into my style or apply as the last step of the style. It has to coat thick and then smoothed in for maximum effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;Depending on hair type a little may go a long way. But I&#x27;m natural, chemical-free and I have coarse kinky hair which is the hardest possible to manage, so I need more. Every other hair type will need less. This edge control last a while and is low cost. I understand the bad review because you have to know how to use it properly to get best results. It will last the entire day and evening, you have to apply daily or every 2 days. You will get a very shiny look and wavy regardless of hair type and it&#x27;s a soft and NOT greasy feel. So play around with it and you should be fine.</li>
    <li> No holding power, just a little bit of shine.  Did not what I expected. Won&#x27;t be ordering this stuff again.</li>
    <li> Doesnt hold as long as i would like</li>
    <li> Well I only give it a 4 of 5 because CON sucks lol. All its products BUT this one suck. Any case, THIS product is very good. It is 100% better then JAM and if you use JAM you know what I mean. That gross greasy feeling. Yuck. It left my hair feeling super soft.&lt;br /&gt;WHAT is in it: Aqua (Water) (Eau), Ceteareth-25, Propylene Glycol, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Glycerin, Oleth-20, PEG-7Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polysorbate 60, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Keratin Amino Acids, Parfum (Fragrance), Linalool, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylparaben, Methylparaben, CI 19140 (Yellow 5), CI 17200 (Red 33)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not bad lol. I would tell everyone to buy this :3</li>
    <li> As you can see this product have so many great reviews that it would make you think that its bomb.com. Negative! When first applied its slicks my edges down for a few minutes. So now I use my eco style gel with it and like a hour later my edges look like I never put anything on it. Ian I decided I will carry this edge control everywhere I go to reapply as much as needed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, it didn&#x27;t hold my hair as long as i thought it would but I would still recommend :)</li>
    <li> I have 4b natural hair and I normally use natural hair care products on my head.  This gel would not hold my hair down more than 15 minutes and I received several comments about flakes in my hair from the use.  Perhaps it works better for black women with relaxers?  At first I thought the gel was interacting with my hair products so I tried to switch up but it didn&#x27;t matter the same thing kept occuring.  Hicks was the only gel that I could find to really work wonders on my hair.  I received a free sample from the Natural hair show and I&#x27;m ready to give it away.</li>
    <li> The perfect edge control. Works like a charm. I finnally found one that works for me . In the past I used hicks but this definitely is much better in quality and price</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It is a lot better than Edge Control (Green Jar).  It does not flake and contains Argan Oil, which keeps my hair looking health during use.  Caution if you use the product you must wash your hair frequently (product build-up).</li>
    <li> I bought this product at my local beauty supply. There wasn&#x27;t much of a price difference. I have tried about 4 different hair gels over the past 6 months and they have either stripped the hair from my edges, left a white residue, made hair flaky, too hard, made my hair greasy, or the product itself just smelled bad. In other words, a lot of hair gels just does not get it right. I&#x27;d really like to have rated this gel a 3.5 but I have to settle for the three stars. I rated it three stars because the gel does not hold for an extended period of time. I use this on my hair as well as my daughter&#x27;s and after about an hour, our edges are no longer controlled. Other than the short time it lasts, I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about this product. This product does NOT leave your hair hard, greasy, flaky, itchy, or take your hair out. It has a nice smell to it as well. You can smell the argan oil (in which I LOVE). If you&#x27;re looking for a hair gel that&#x27;ll hold for a short time, I&#x27;d recommend it. However, if you are looking for a long lasting, night-on-the-town hold, then you should keep searching.</li>
    <li> I purchased the edge control once before at my local beauty supply and have used it every since. I have really soft hair that tends to frizz up alot so it works great to tame those frizzies.  And unlike other edge controls it doesn&#x27;t leave that white flaky substance on your edges and in your hair.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say but the hold with this is terrible. It&#x27;s super greasy too. I have very coarse hair but maybe it could work for people with looser curls or a fresh relaxer. I would say it has the same level of effectiveness as a jam product. Not drying, but no hold at all. ORS edge control does leave that white residue, but at least it provides hold. I would suggest ECO Styler gel, or ORS edge control mixed with water instead. This product was a huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> Im a sucker for trying new products! I refer to myself as a \\&quot;product junkie\\&quot; I tried this product and the first week it worked well for my hair. But well over two weeks of use my hair started to curl up and become greasy! It seemed like my hair had become ammune to this product; and stopped working for my hair. I do like the product because it does not turn white even when it is used day after day! But after awhile it did not work for my hair!</li>
    <li> This stuff is OK. I have natural 4a/4b hair and this really slicks my edges down so nicely. I just wish that they would stay laid longer - by the end of the day, they&#x27;re usually a little frizzy. However, it&#x27;s great for short events such as church service! :) Also, for the amount of product that you get in this jar, it&#x27;s just not worth the price! I think the jar should be bigger because it didn&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked it to. I do love the smell and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
    <li> thank you, it works great!</li>
    <li> I should first say that I have natural hair and wear box braids. Anyway, I was recommended to use this by my hairdresser to keep some of my hairs intact.  I applied this gel to my hairline for about the first two weeks following my new set of braids.  For the most part, they stayed down, but I did find myself reapplying maybe once or twice by the second week or so. Suddenly, one morning I woke up with most of my hairline absolutely GONE; you can imagine how flabbergasted I was. I would say if you use this use it SPARINGLY but overall, just be weary of the potential consequences.</li>
    <li> Have to uses to much .</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last like most edge control products</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> I selected this product because I needed to control my hairline .I wear my hair in  pony tails and buns, This product has great control. It is not greasy and has a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other products, that I have used, it does not dry leaving white coloring or any flaking.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to any one trying to tame their edges .</li>
    <li> This stuff truly works! Especially if you are looking for a sleek look which is what i wear most time ( ponytails). You will not be dissappointed and the shipping was fast as well!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this gel! I generally could not get my edges to lay down well, but with this stuff my edges lay down totally flat and look great! A little goes a long way. I have tried the olive oil edge control and it did not work as well as this and the olive oil edge control flaked and caused a lot of buildup.</li>
    <li> This product has a light smell, much like the other creme of nature products in this line. I find that it doesn&#x27;t hold my edges down all day. I tried applying the gel, brushing it in and putting on a scarf for 15 min. It still doesn&#x27;t last past noon. However, there is no flaking, my hair feels smooth and strong like it promises, it just doesn&#x27;t hold all day. This is the first gel I&#x27;ve ever tried on my hair, I&#x27;m 12 weeks post relaxer, but my natural hair is 4b/4c. I&#x27;m open to any other product recommendations :)</li>
    <li> I love this product! No streaky residue and it really makes my edges look nice.  I only have to use it every 2nd day at the most ! I will be ordering more! I am a natural girl with very soft , wavy, curly hair.</li>
    <li> I like this line of products and I actually initially thought this was a gel.  Works really well without drying.  Wish they would also make a gel and put this one in a larger container.  Great for using when making high buns and using pony tail pieces!</li>
    <li> i got this product as a sample at the beauty supply store and just HAD to have it ! it smoothes over everything ! i would not use a lot of this product as it is VERY thick and almost like pomade it smells great and it is perfectly price</li>
    <li> holds back my fly always without flaking, damaging my hair or making my hair look crunchy &amp; it doesn&#x27;t take much product to hold my hair in place...it doesn&#x27;t last all day, if you have happy hour after work, you will need to reapply, but not much, less is more...</li>
    <li> Love this product! Works great and doesn&#x27;t turn your hair white and chalky/pasty looking.</li>
    <li> I tried this gel, it seemed to work ok. I have pretty soft tangly hair. My biggest problem was the smell.  I am VERY sensitive to strong weird odors. So it ended up in the garbage!</li>
    <li> OMG IS THERE A NO STAR BUTTON. I ABSOLUTLEY HATED THIS PRODUCT! IT HELD MY EDGES FOR LITTERALY 30 SECONDS AND THATS IT. IF IT MATTERS IM BLACK.</li>
    <li> this product is excellent!!! straightens out my edges perfectly.  I often waits months to perm my hair to avoid hair damages so this product really helps me to refrain from over processing my hair.</li>
    <li> Hate this product. My hair is already curling back up before I walk out the door. Waste of my time, and I don&#x27;t even have a corse hair texture.  It moisturizes I guess!</li>
    <li> It works great on my 3b natural hair!! I love the hold and shine. Definitely going to purchase more. You really can&#x27;t beat the price either. It&#x27;s also sold at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.</li>
    <li> Great product to lay down edged ! Plus it don&#x27;t look white when it is apply to edges. Sleek and smooth and clean look</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Makes my edges sleek and smooth and waves up the surrounding hair. This is my go to product now!</li>
    <li> Did not hold my edges! Worked for a friend though.</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave it 4 is because it doesn&#x27;t stay as long as I want it to.. BUT overall??? This product is bomb.. and it&#x27;s healthy, my edges love it!!</li>
    <li> Try it, and you too will love it. It is a wet product, water based, so if you do not have a permanent, or if you are not wearing a natural style, but a pressed or flat-ironed style and you have curly or wavy hair, this product will slick hair edges down, but too much, will cause waves...</li>
    <li> I love my edges flat. This Edges control really holds your hair down. Not hard .&lt;br /&gt;My son wear braids .I even use it to keep his fizzes down.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT! and it came really fast!</li>
    <li> Very cool product, helps slick my edges!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last the whole day</li>
    <li> Love it my hair is natural and after I applied it to my edges looks like I just got. Fresh perm</li>
    <li> Great product that works very well for my needs. Thank you for offering a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> A very good product and performs what it indicates on the package.&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice shine and smells good as well</li>
    <li> Ok. So just got it because of the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Once you put it on, your edges are exactly how you want them.  Then they come back up.  Less than 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I cornrowed my hair and used it on the edges but like I said nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> The best hands down. I love it</li>
    <li> This product does what it says. My edges are manageable now and this product gives my edges a great shine and hold!</li>
    <li> It does what it says it does, but after a while it does build up. No flaking though which is a plus. Holds for most of the day, wouldn&#x27;t say I love it, but its ok.</li>
    <li> Two Words, Buy This. Its Perfection To Your Edges</li>
    <li> I thought I was sold on the edge product &amp;#34;Hicks&amp;#34; but my friend had Creme of Nature, I tried it and loved it. I bought some and think it works better than Hicks.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried it and you do you&#x27;ll love it, when I say it works, it really works and it works well.</li>
    <li> I will say that for the price this edge control does it&#x27;s job. But like most edge control products, it only last for a good minute before its back to fuzzy edges. I enjoy the ingredients in this product as it does not crust or turn white like others. It&#x27;s a smoother light mixture instead of waxy/thick. Can get a little greasy looking so a little goes a long way.Around $3 - $4 at my local beauty supply so check there first!</li>
    <li> Honey, I don&#x27;t know who edges this pomade will hold but certainly not my soft, curly edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefit of this product is it smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried it on my wet and dry hair and still I got curly edges :[</li>
    <li> I bought this when I was in High school and it worked for like a maximum of an hour or two.. but, by the time I got back from school it was back to normal texture. I did like the fact that its good for your hair. it helped my edges grow back after all those lace fronts but, it didn&#x27;t last long so yeah... no.. BUT, I&#x27;m a product junkie so maybe I would buy it again because of what it did for my edges but other than that... meh I recommend a pomade like Aveda Brilliant Anti Humectant Pomade or Hicks Edges Pomade. I&#x27;m a natural but, I wear my hair straight 24/7 if this works for me. it can work for anyone. and last all day baby! woo! :)</li>
    <li> i have tryed a few edge control products and i love this one the most it dident have build up it wasent greese and it dident make my hair curly at the edges because i am natural and it dident cost a arm and a leg and the shine it gave my hair was awsome</li>
    <li> I have tried everything to hold back the &amp;#34;wispies&amp;#34; around my daughter&#x27;s face (especially when she wears it up). The products either A) Didn&#x27;t hold, B) Were basically GLUE, C) Were very visible on dark hair. THIS stuff is wonderful. It smells good, holds ALL DAY (even through tumbling/gymnastics class!), leaves just a pretty shine (but not TOO much - just natural) without being VISIBLE, washes out easily and is easy to put on/doesn&#x27;t pull hair. Highly recommend. We will buy this every time and I wish I found it sooner.</li>
    <li> Great on my edges, did not flake or dry-out my hair.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product!!! it absolutely will not hold ur edges down, it&#x27;s just like putting hair oil on ur edges. I have used the olive  oil edge control and it works but it leaves a white film on your edges and so I decided to try this one but this absolutely DOES NOT WORK!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this, definitely gonna order this again!</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS WELL WORTH THE PRICE AND IT WORKS BEAUTIFULLY.  I WOULD DEFINITELY PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.  THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> It works better than edge control doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue after using it. It is a little greasy but it serves its purpose</li>
    <li> This product is great on natural and relaxed hair. It can be used daily without much build up. I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I t worked when it came to smoothing and conditioning my hair/edges and smells great, BUT my hair line started to break out with acne which is horrible :( I would reccomend this to anyone, because it works but I guess I just had an allergic reaction to something in the product which is why I only gave it two starts.</li>
    <li> I like it, but be careful when you use this bc your hair supposed to be clean if you want to put this in your hair. If you use this when your hair is dirty Then you will see white stuff &amp; it&#x27;ll make your hair sticky.</li>
    <li> Awesome product , not sticky , doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, and it works!!! You only need a little bit to lay the edges down</li>
