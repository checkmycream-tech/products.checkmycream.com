    <li> I was so excited to get this kit! I mainly wanted all the brushes to have a variety. But, when I opened my package there was only the eyeshadow? I mean I&#x27;m really annoyed I guess I will have to call and see what&#x27;s up but I waited forever for this is this is very annoying.</li>

    <li> great value &amp; good colors. the price was great. very happy. and the colors are a bit glittery, which is my favorite :)</li>
    <li> Really wide colour variety. I like the brushes, but the brush case smells pretty strongly of fake leather smell.</li>
    <li> After waiting for a couple of weeks this beauty ot finally arrived. Its a great product at a good price. The brushes do have a chemical smell to them, but not anything unbearable.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t give it a five star only cuz it took forever to come like two months but it was worth the wait amazing products the pigmentation it&#x27;s a 9/10 great brushes and lovely colors</li>

    <li> First off, I love the brush set.  It has everything that you need.  However, the eye shadows are horrible.  Most of them leave no color except for a little shimmer.  The ones that do have some pigment (the dark colors like black) don&#x27;t stay where you put them and end up all over your eyes.  Would not buy this again!!!</li>
    <li> Product came in good condition</li>
    <li> A few of the eyeshadows were broken when I opened it :( Other than that I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> The brushes were ok, but the shadows were not pigmented at all!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!! The shadows are great.</li>
    <li> I love the palette and the brushes are so soft</li>
    <li> I love this makeup set. The brushes have a strange smell but I can get past it. The colors are great. Exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> Very bad eye shadows!! 👎👎</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 1 star because I couldn&#x27;t give it none I HATED this eye shadow it doesn&#x27;t do anything u don see it when you apply it I give this 👎</li>
    <li> Bristles are not natural in feel , they are the same with every type of brush. It is suppose to perform a different function then bristles should be different. You cannot apply blush with the same bristle as you apply liquid or powder foundation, otherwise what would be the purpose of buying multiple brushes? I noticed pen scribble on plastic making it seem as they were tampered with. Also, some of the bristles were damaged before using. I never used them didn&#x27;t even  waste my time. I returned this package.</li>
