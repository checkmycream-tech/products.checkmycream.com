<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product. I have had terrible rosacea for years (I am in my mid-40s). I use another homeopathic product at night that helped a lot, but the additional application of Earth&#x27;s Daughter aloe vera applied in the morning did the trick.  My rosacea is gone!  For the first time in my life, I have no pus-filled pimples or red patches. It&#x27;s hard to express how wonderful it is to go around without feeling self-conscious about my face. This gel doesn&#x27;t moisturize very much, but since my skin is so much healthier now, it&#x27;s not an issue. I will be ordering this product again. The bottle will last a long, long time, but I will order in plenty of time because I never want to run out!</li>
    <li> I love this gel!  I thought I had already reviewed it but I guess I didn&#x27;t and had only replied to the seller. Excellent customer service and I&#x27;m very pleased with this gel. I would definitely order more. It&#x27;s light..almost like water. It is not messy, clumpy or thick and it&#x27;s virtually fragrance free.  It absorbs well and is very soothing. I think this is the next best thing to cutting a piece of Aloe plant and applying it to your skin, without the bother and mess.  I personally mix mine with Vitamin E &amp; Almond oil in a separate glass bottle but it&#x27;s great all on it&#x27;s own.  Keep up the good work!  Thank you......</li>
    <li> I used this on my face &amp; mix w/ Shea butter for body butter. I believe there is alcohol in this. Very drying👎🏾</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonder! I use it daily in my homemade face moisturizer and my homemade body butters. It has made a huge difference with regulating my t-zone oils and breakouts and has really diminished  the look of my acne scars. It gives my makeup a matte look all day and is still hydrated. Also great for eczema and kp covered toddler. Plus all his scrapes and boo-boos. I keep it upstairs and downstairs and in the Baby bag. I even got my skeptical husband using it as aftershave since he gets really bad bumps and razor burn. Really helps for the bikini area too! I have notice less bumps and irritation with each use.</li>
    <li> This is about as close as one can get to the actual aloe plant and I appreciate that. I currently use this as a facial moisturizer to help with acne and so far, my skin has reacted positively to it. As others have written, do not expect this to feel like the typical gel consistency of other aloe products. I apply it to my face with a cotton pad and that works wonderfully. I will order again.</li>
    <li> This is by far, the absolute best aloe vera gel I have found. It soaks right in, no smells, I can carry it with me. It is getting me through my radiation therapy, and so far I have no skin reactions to the radiation or to the product.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use it on my face.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to put in a mixture for my daughter&#x27;s eczema and at first I thought it was a little runny but after trying it, this stuff is potent! I was amazed at how well it works...when used alone, it is runny but to be honest, that&#x27;s really not a problem. I will order more and my daughter&#x27;s skin has improved...</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I heard that aloe Vera was good for scars in addition to healing if skin. My daughter had had a surgery and her scar was acting up and getting inflamed, getting pink. I decided to give this a try, I applied it after a bath and noticed in the morning that the irritation was less. So I&#x27;ve been using daily and noticed that its helping a lot and kind of balances her skin out. Her scar is an area that it constantly growing and stretching and I honestly feel that this is helping maintain heathy scar tissue.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decided to buy this gel to use on my oily face.  I wash my face twice daily with my facial brush and apply the gel and go.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup so I can really see a difference in my skin.  The aloe helps to control the oil on my face.  It dries clear and doesn&#x27;t flake.  My blemishes are notably fewer and heal quicker with the gel.  I also had a problem with large pores and the gel reduces my pores my face feels great.  I will continue buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;I also used this product to calm an itchy scalp and it works great!</li>
    <li> Great product. Lately I&#x27;ve been using it to soothe my skin when it gets irritated from vitamin c or dermarolling. Works great!</li>
    <li> This worked, hands down, better than anything my family has ever used before. My husband and one if my children are red heads and our trip to the beach this year was amazing in part to this product. Takes the sting out of a burn and heals so quickly. We will never use anything else. My little guy has a small case if eczema, this is proving to help him as well!</li>
    <li> It would be great if EWG (Environmental Working Group) would review and get it listed for added quality assurance.  Used it to relieve bandage adhesive irritation caused by repeatedly needing to change dressings on a wound.  Because it is absorbed so quickly it didn&#x27;t interfere with bandage adhesion with each repeat dressing.  Also found this gel works very well with essential oils and preparing homemade personal care products that don&#x27;t need a thick gel consistency.  The added ingredients for preservation are much safer than chemical additives used by other manufacturers - nice that this is a USA organically grown aloe plant source.</li>
    <li> Aloe Vera Gel was recommended on a site &amp;#34;Dermatologists consider aloe vera gel to be one of the best natural treatments for dry skin on the eyelids. It can often soothe and moisturize dry skin of any kind. If the eyelids are cracked, aloe vera can also speed up healing time&amp;#34;. Based on this I started my research, there were many, but they had other ingredients and hadn&#x27;t had great reviews. Found Earth&#x27;s Daughter Aloe Vera Gel during my search, it&#x27;s more pricey than the others, but is any price too much to pay for any great product that works! I think it&#x27;s a great value for the priceI always remember &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; i.e., you buy &#x27;cheap&#x27; you get &#x27;cheap&#x27; non-quality product! I can sincerely say that even after 2 uses I see where this product was a great purchase. My purpose for purchasing is I recently developed dry, itchy, scaly eyelids (don&#x27;t know what caused it, whether cosmetics, hair dye, etc.) but was horrible, eye shadow would always bleed through and itched sometimes so bad my eyes would become so swollen that had to take Benedryl or Predisone for relief. I received the product yesterday (12/18), used before going to bed and again this morning (12/19) before apply eye shadow. The eye shadow went on very smoothly, no bleeding through the concealer, no itching, make up smooth on eyelids. I can only speak for my own experience and my ailment to say that this product works! I&#x27;m so very happy I found this Aloe Vera Gel. Thank you Earth&#x27;s Daughter for a great product at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I have no complaints from this product. It helped  with my dandruff, it helped when my girls and I got sunburned, it even helped heal my knee when I split it open. I little dab a few times a day helped it heal up quick with little scaring when I should have got stitches! On top of all that it will leave your skin and face nice and smooth. I just love when I know what I am putting on my and my childrens bodies has no harsh, unnatural chemicals... And is not completely expensive! I will definitely always have a bottle or 2 of this stuff around the house.</li>
    <li> I burned my leg on the motorcycle.  I put Ice and this aloe on it and never got a blister.  It&#x27;s healing quite nicely!</li>
    <li> I use this product as a face moisturizer mixed with shea butter or by itself on my hair.  I am amazed at the results and consistency of this product.</li>
    <li> I recently had to under go radiation therapy as a follow up for cancer surgery. They recommended I use 100% pure Aloe Vera Gel. The products in the store all had additives. I found this online. It is a great product and kept my skin very clear during treatment. I didn&#x27;t put it on one area because I thought the radiation wasn&#x27;t hitting that particular spot, and that is where my skin broke out with blisters! Put it on everywhere!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best aloe vera gel I ever used. It is cooling and refreshing without the goopiness of store bought brand. There is no menthol in this, which is how it should be. I use this daily for my skin for moisture.</li>
    <li> Excellent,,, My husband has Rosella ands dry skin patches and the  ALOE VERA GEL has made&lt;br /&gt;Such a Hugh  difference for the better.  We are in Florida  3 to 5 months a year and this when used  after being in the sun helps keep our skin moisturized and not dried out from sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;There are those that will complain like it not being a gel  because its too thin, BUT IT IS !!! Its a thin gel which  is sooooo much better.&lt;br /&gt;It spreads nice w/ out glopping or feeling sticky like other pure aloe thick gels do.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECCOMEND!!! Will continue to buy!!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I have to say that the minute that I got the gel, I fell in love with it. The gel is not like any other products in the market, which is greasy and not comforting at all. The gel itself is like water, and I could really feel my skin absorb the gel very quickly as soon as I patted it on the skin. I have acne problems, and this product does not cause break out at all; what&#x27;s amazing is that it has been comforting my skin. Each time after using the product, I could get the icy, cool feeling on my skin. I cannot comment on the long-term effect of the gel, given the fact that I have been only used this for less than 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, another thing I want to emphasize is the excellent customer service I got. After 10 days&#x27; uses, the cap broke. It is not like normally broken, because I neither dropped the bottle on the ground nor did anything in anyway to damage the product. It is just that the gel is not coming out of the cap like it should, and it seems like somewhere stuck in the middle. Anyway, I contacted the seller, and they get a replacement for me even though I did not ask them to. I am so pleased with the customer service and I look forward to receiving the product and continuing using it.</li>
    <li> amazing. I used this for a serious sunburn, and have been using it for dry spots/scars. definitely the best aloe product i&#x27;ve found on the market (either online or in drug stores). don&#x27;t buy the ones that say 100% gel , you want 100% ALOE, not gel!!! THis is watery because the product is REAL and not made into gel. will keep buying in future if i need more aloe</li>
    <li> great for my skin, i use it right before i put on my moisturizer and it has made my skin look soo good!</li>
    <li> The closest thing you&#x27;ll get to using the aloe plant itself. Made my dry, red irritated skin become soft and healed. Miracle worker for burns or any minor skin ailment.</li>
    <li> Never thought I&#x27;d get my hands on enough natural Aloe to do all the things I needed. I looked on amazon months ago for a natural aloe Vera gel, most were half chemicals this is the closest thing to the plant. I will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product! I use this for my hair and it is fantastic. I have issues with a lot of hair products causing skin irritation on my scalp. This is my new &amp;#34;go to* for styling my hair. Next I believe I will try as a face lotion! Thank you for such a great product. I am now a lifer!!</li>
    <li> I am only giving this 4 stars because when I received it some has leaked out of the bottle even though it had a seal around the top.  The lid was slightly loose.  Not much had come out or I would of returned it and gotten a new one.  I hvae used it in some home made recipes and have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I really love this gel.  It&#x27;s actually a little less gel-like, but I don&#x27;t mind it at all.  I not only use it on my skin, which makes me feel silky soft, I also use it as a hair gel to give a little bit of definition to my short layered hair.  It&#x27;s not sticky in my hair.  It&#x27;s not super stiff in my hair either, but I don&#x27;t want that for my hair anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this gel in my home-made hand sanitizer and I have found that my hands are so much better than the typical hand sanitizer.  The typical brands were making my hands dry, split and peel.  In a small 1 oz squeeze bottle I put one half of the gel and then one half of Humphrey&#x27;s Homeopathic Witch Hazel (which has organic witch hazel AND organic alcohol).</li>
    <li> Fantastic aloe vera gel. Love that it&#x27;s totally pure without additives. And you can really tell the difference compared to other aloe vera gels found in the average store. A little goes a long way. I love that it&#x27;s 100% noncomodegetic (does not clog pores) and is fantastic on my naturally oily skin on my face. It helps my face not get oily throughout the day, while still keeping it moisturized but my pores are able to breathe.  It is also good for lightening your skin. I have noticed since I started using it on a daily basis that my face has not been tanning like it used to. It does not hold color anymore and realized recently that it is definitely because of how much I&#x27;ve been using this aloe vera gel for the past few weeks. If that is a quality you are looking for, this aloe Vera gel is great! I, however, actually like getting some color when I tan, so I&#x27;m going to decrease my frequency of use. This aloe Vera gel is fantastic for sunburns too! My face got too red yesterday so I applied two layers of this gel last night and this morning my face was totally lightened with no signs of sunburn or tan whatsoever! It absorbs very nicely also, and makeup can be applied over it. It&#x27;s also great for rashes! My husband got a rash on his inner thighs the other day from working out in the yard on a hot summer day all day long, so applied some of this gel to the rash and it greatly improved overnight. I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my husbands face and neck while going through radiation treatments and it really seem to have helped. He is not one for lotions and goopy gels. This one is not slimy or thick so the consistency works well for him.</li>
    <li> What I like about this product besides being 100% pure is that it is not a gel that you have to push around your skin until your skin is covered and the gel has been dispersed.  This is more liquidified but not runny  Had great success using it for my Mexican sunburn.  I really believe it aided in healing and cut down on the flaky.  Great purchase and will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the aloe vera gel, needed to have something for my skin after radiation treatments and it really helps with any burning or sensitive skin issues, would certainly recommend.</li>
    <li> I recently developed gum recession and didn&#x27;t have dental insurance. I went to my previous dentist and had to cover the whole cost of cleaning, $417 out of pocket. It was just regular cleaning and not a pure treatment for gum recession. I was advised to keep brushing teeth as always. Then, I did some research for at home gum recession treatment and Aloe Vera showed up in it. So far I feel great every time I brush my teeth with Aloe Vera and other at home treatment. Hopefully, I get dental coverage soon to continue treating my gum recession.</li>
    <li> I love this product for a few reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I have an unknown skin allergy and when I put this product on it, it cleared it right up!&lt;br /&gt;2) It works wonderfully for eczema!&lt;br /&gt;3) I have naturally curly hair (African American) and I used it as a hair gel and it works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried to use it for anything else yet but I am very appreciative of the personalized email that was sent with recipes and old school remedies.</li>
    <li> I have used many other aloe vera gels and was a little disappointed when I received your product. However, once I started using the product, I was glad it was lighter than most gels as it absorbed quickly into my skin. I am using this gel to treat my neck currently undergoing radiation therapy. Surprising enough after 3 weeks of treatment I have yet to show the red burning that most other patients exhibit by now. I really like this stuff and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Used with other natural ingredients for a topical lotion to ease discomfort for my Golden&#x27;s allergy rash.  This Aloe product appears to be the nearest to what I have harvested directly from my Aloe plant.  I am pleased with the results.  Will continue to use this product.  Also will explore offerings as needed from this company for future needs.</li>
    <li> Used this in combination with Calendula while going thru radiation treatment. HIGHLY RECOMMEND~</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I was concerned about the bottle leaking in shipment, the fragrance, the thin consistency, or breaking out from a bad reaction. All things noted in other reviews. My experience- the bottle came intact with no leaks, I do not notice a fragrance and I usually buy fragrance free products to avoid fragrances, and the gel is thin but it is easy to apply and a little goes a long way. I was pleased to find out that my skin had an excellent reaction to the gel. My wintery dry skin is softer than ever and scars from surgery in early December are fading very quickly. I am using it from head to toe and highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I looked for a very pure aloe vera for a long time, for topical use on my face and body and scalp. Yay! This is it! This is the good stuff. Best on the market. NO toxic ingredients or dyes or anything, none. Great for face (moisturize lightly and tonic), all skin, scalp, and for sunburn. Not a gel, it&#x27;s liquidy because it&#x27;s not modified and adulterated with other crud. I researched all the crap in skin and shampoo products, what a chore. Nothing possibly toxic at all in it. Slight amount of citric acid in it as a natural preservative so you don&#x27;t have to refrigerate; good ph for skin anyway. Anyway I put this on all over after a shower. I add a few drops of cold-pressed organic chilean rose hip seed oil (I used Majestic brand, it is great, I reviewed it too) to a long squirt of this aloe vera and smooth it on. Wrinkling gone and skin is younger. This combo really moisturizes and nourishes the skin. Tried everything out there for dry aging skin and this combo is DA BOMB in every way. Stopped using all other skin products.    Also for winter-dry scalp, wash hair lightly, put this stuff on and massage in, wrap in towel and wait 20 min, then wash lightly out as usual. Helps cleanse and moisturize. Optionally massage in a tiny bit of jojoba or rose hip seed oil afterwards. Avoid drying and toxic ingredients in shampoos- many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;  products have them too. (Read the labels and look up what each strange name is.)  I was not given anything and dont know this vendor, I found this product through research of my own. I need to avoid toxic ingredients and take care of skin naturally.</li>
    <li> I was just about to order another bottle of this great aloe when I received a request to review it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I like it.  I use it medicinally on my body every day.  I combine it with essential oils to nourish my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love aloe, and I love this product!</li>
    <li> Thank you Earth&#x27;s Daughter for a pure and natural product the I can use on my forever oily skin! It works wonderfully as a base before applying my make up and keeps it fresh all day long without any break outs! Who could ask for more? I am just sorry it took me so long to find this awesome product. It also keeps my aging neck soft and supple and not crepe looking.&lt;br /&gt;But what I actually bought it for was my hands, which are severely dry with ugly age spots. All I can say is what a Mircle this gel is! I mix it with a little vitamin C serum and like magic I have beautiful soft almost spot free hands, like I did in my 20&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;This Aloe Vera is a keeper!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see how this has so many positive reviews.  There is nothing &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; like about it.  It&#x27;s like water; goes on such, dries as such, and leaves my skin feeling as dry as it started.  Extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of aloe vera gel in general. I use it as a primer under makeup, as a treatment for my acne marks, for sunburns, for body lotion, and also for my belly during and after pregnancy. Im sure I&#x27;ll find even more uses though. This aloe vera gel is the absolute best I have ever tried. Ive tried quite a few and had been pretty loyal to a certain &#x27;natural&#x27; brand out there, but then when I read the ingredients on that brand I realized there were so many unneeded ingredients in it and it really wasnt as natural and pure as I hoped. Then on a wimb I decided to try this Earth&#x27;s Daughter aloe vera and I found out that it is worlds away from the other &#x27;natural&#x27; one I had been using. The texture and feel and smell are so much better. Also, the other brand I had been using left my skin feeling tight and sticky, which I had come to believe was just normal for aloe. But Earth&#x27;s Daughter soaks in to my skin and leaves it soft and moisturized, no tightness and no sticky residue. Its amazing!! You will not regret purchasing this. I&#x27;m now a loyal Earth&#x27;s Daughter customer and will be purchasing many more bottles - one bottle lasts quite a bit but I use it for so many purposes. Also, they have excellent customer service. I had a minor issue with the packaging on my order, so I contacted Earth&#x27;s Daugther and they responded very fast and resolved it.</li>
    <li> I have quite fair skin (being English) and I also live at 7,000 feet elevation where the atmosphere is thinner and allows the sun rays through more strongly...you probably already see where this is going. Red...very, very, very red is the colour of my skin typically when I do one of the 14,000 feet hikes that surround me. This has been a lifesaver and has helped return to my skin to a normal human colour. I also use it as a light gel as I hate all those hair products with their petro0-chemicals and alcohols. I love that it is cold pressed to maintain all the active nutrients and that it is organic, these points are VERY important to me being that I am a nutritionist. Definitely the best aloe I have found so far.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase. I have been using the aloe Vera gel to my breast while receiving radiation for my breast cancer. It helps heal my skin, helps reduce inflammation too. My advice is to put it in the refrigerator for extra added relief . I apply the gel after treatment and lay on my bed in front of the fan. This summer has been hot and humid. Never a good time for cancer but this stuff is good!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty damn good for hydrating the skin, and because it is not as thick as other gels it spreads very well which means that the product won&#x27;t run out as quickly. I&#x27;ve got to say that for, I forget like twenty bucks, this product has been the best bang for my buck I&#x27;ve had for a while. I suffer some pretty severe acne and there is not a lot of stuff out there that is directed towards anything beyond moderate acne. I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days and I can see my skin improving; redness and swelling has already reduced, I can tell some of the scarring is started to fade and my skin just looks more hydrated and healthy overall. I am intrigued to see the long term benefits. But as for now I got to say, good job Earth&#x27;s Daughter, you got yourself a happy costumer. I also like that it&#x27;s a reasonably priced quality product made in America, that&#x27;s rare these days.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It is great for the skin.  Leaves skin nice, moisturized and not sticky. I&#x27;ve been using it nightly since it arrived and when I wake up my face is still nicely moisturized (which does not happen with the Vit-E oil I was using).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the taste as well. Not sure if it is meant for brushing teeth but I used it for this (along with my toothpaste and the taste was refreshing and almost sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys the natural side of life!</li>
    <li> This product is lovely.  It soaks right in, which allows one to keep applying it until the skin doesn&#x27;t need any more.  My hands crack terribly in the winter, and this works instantly, promotes significant healing overnight, and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling.  I also use it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a lot less fillers and additives in it compared to the aloe gels I was buying at my local health food store, and it still costs less per ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as you are not sensitive to Aloe, this product is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I am undergoing radiation therapy on my neck. My neck is pretty well burned and close to blistering. I immediately applied the Aloe Vera gel from Earth&#x27;s Daughter. It made an immediate difference. It soothed the pain and prevented blistering. I am continuing to apply it to my neck to relieve the pain and help my skin repair.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love about organic USA grown aloe? This stuff is great for sunburn and minor burns. I like this over the store bought mass produced aloe due to this is all done in the USA.</li>
    <li> So my new barber put aloe vera in my hair and rubbed it on my scalp after the haircut.  Never had that before.  Throughout the day I noticed my scalp was not itchy, I was not touching my hair, and my hair looked healthy. No other styling gels or products were applied.  So I bought some green aloe vera gel at Walmart.  It was thicker than this, allowing for more styling, but obvious.  I didn&#x27;t like the gooey sticky feel either.  So I found this on Amazon.  This is purer, with less added chemicals. It is about half the consistency of the gel.  I goes on nicely, although I think I have to use a little more. My scalp has never been healthier. My hair was damaged and looks healthier now after about 3 weeks use. It would be interesting to know the percentage concentration of aloe vera in this vs the gel.  Does thinner consistency mean less aloe vera delivered?</li>
    <li> So far this has proven to be a great product.  Once dry it almost disappears on your skin, leaving it soft feeling. My primary reason for buying this was to put on my face after AK blue light therapy, and it&#x27;s working great.  I think this bottle will last forever and will be one I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I use as an additive to my hair and scalp oil.  Light and unscented!</li>
    <li> Something in this gel made my face red.  It&#x27;s too bad I can&#x27;t use this.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t&#x27;t get past the smell. Used for homemade hand sanitizer and even essential oils couldn&#x27;t&#x27;t mask it.</li>
    <li> First of all - it was a big surprise to find what this gel can do. When I received an e-mail from the seller telling when you should apply it, I was a bit skeptical. I bought this gel for very different purposes, and never thought of applying it as a remedy for inflamed suture. Well, at the moment I received this gel, I did have a problem with one of my old suture that got inflamed after a severe cold I had recently. And nothing I tried to treat it worked. My doctor doesn&#x27;t have openings in his schedule for 2+ weeks, and I already got desperate. Then I read the seller&#x27;s description of the product, and decided to apply it. I didn&#x27;t have much hope. To my surprise, next morning my scar that for a week looked like a bubble and hurt with every my movement (couldn&#x27;t touch it either), so next morning it got 2 times smaller and didn&#x27;t hurt as much as it did before. Well, after that I applied it constantly. After two days it is back to its normal size, doesn&#x27;t hurt when I move, and it almost fully recovered. And yes, I tried antibiotic creams, soothing oils, and etc. I am very grateful that such a product exists. I am also glad that the seller told in his e-mail about specific uses of this gel. The only thing I would suggest for improvement - I think the detailed description of uses would help better if it were placed in Amazon description of the product. I would buy it earlier then. And I am definitely gonna buy more now and tell my friends to do so as well. One more time - thank you for your product!</li>
    <li> Updated review 3/17. I&#x27;ve had this product for 3 months now and am still using it daily on my face and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Convert. The thick, gel-like aloe you see on the market is loaded with chemicals. This is the closest to pure aloe you&#x27;ll get, especially for this price. Will be more watery and sink into skin very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- In the beginning, I felt dry after using it. But since my skin has balanced out dramatically, all I need is a few taps and it absorbs the aloe quickly. (NOTE: Other aloes often contain alcohol or Alcohol derivatives, and that will DRY YOU OUT over time by breaking down your skin. This had the opposite effect -- over time, my skin balanced out and no longer became super dry after washing. Thus, I absorbed the aloe very well.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- NOTE #2: apparently the aloe sinks in better when your skin/hair is wet. So if you find it&#x27;s not breaking your skin barrier, try rubbing it onto a moist face first or mixing in a drop of jojoba. Over time, your skin will retain better moisture on its own and will not need extra help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- During the winter months, I took a spoon and whipped this aloe with some high-quality jojoba oil. It turns into a thicker gel that is an incredible moisturizer. Both aloe and jojoba are transdermal -- meaning, they absorb deep into the skin, rather than sitting on top of it. (Other oils like vit E help work the surface of the skin, but if you want deep results you can mix with jojoba to break down large oil molecules and &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; it into your pores.) Mixing those 2 together will make sure the anti-inflammatory effects of Aloe and the pore-cleaning effects of jojoba are working hand in hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I am prone to inflammation, so my scalp itches once in a while. A quick massage with this has an immediate cooling effect, and my scalp is itch-free all day. Prior to testing Earth&#x27;s Daughter, the scalp itch would fade in and out during the day; now I just forget abou tit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I use this asa light gel to hold my hair in place after curling with a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I will be repurchasing this over and over and over again. I only use a small nickel-sized amount on my face each morning and night, and a dime-sized amount to coat my front hair strands when I curl them. A few drops on my scalp when necessary. So my bottle is still pretty full, despite daily use. I use a lot when making small batches of the aloe/jojoba, but this is honestly a vanity and cabinet staple. So glad I found you.</li>
    <li> I am outside for many hours a day and the sun/wind really dry out my skin and hair so I need to take extra care of it to keep it in good shape.&lt;br /&gt; I have tried about every Aloe on the market which did an OK job but I was looking for something more natural/pure.&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled onto Earths Daughter and thought that I would give it a try to see if it is as good as it says it is.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it nightly on my face just before I go to bed for a couple weeks now and I can see a  big change in my skin...it&#x27;s much smoother and has a nice glow to it...not a shine but a healthy glow. I rinse my face with water in the morning and all the aloe has been absorbed by my skin overnight so there&#x27;s no residue left on my face.It has a more watery texture to it instead of the thick gel you buy in the stores so it gets absorbed better into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I was careless one day last week and got a sunburn on my face/shoulders so before going to bed I put aloe on both spots and when I got up in the morning the redness was mostly gone and so was the uncomfortable burn on my skin which I thought was pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sitting here typing this review with a combo of the aloe/lemon juice/olive oil/egg on my hair and when I rinse it out and wash it in 30 minutes my hair with be silky smooth and shiny...that too is amazing since the weather really dries it out in the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy to finally find a product that actually does do as it advertised to do and the fact that is the purest aloe I&#x27;ve ever used and it&#x27;s made in the U.S.A..which is an important factor for me.I&#x27;m now a loyal customer of Earth&#x27;s Daughter Aloe.</li>
    <li> Great product. Closest all natural aloe I could find online. I am going thru radiation and so far no skin issues at all and i use this three times a day</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan Aloe Vera, I grow it in my home and think that is another fabulous health care product that mother nature herself has provided! Even though I grow my own, I still like to purchase it in larger quantities and search for high quality organic products. I feel that Earth’s Daughter Aloe Vera really seems to fill the requirements that I have set and performs as highly as I would hope! We not only use our Aloe Vera for sunburns, we use it for boo boos, bug bites, skin issues and so many other problems! Currently I am using our Earth’s Daughter Aloe Vera on my daughters eczema! It not only heals but it soothes! And for a child who is constantly itching and in pain, it’s basically a miracle! Something that brings great relief, but causes no initial pain or burning in the beginning to get to that point! I have also been using this on a few blemishes on my face with great results, not to mention it works great in my son’s hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love knowing that this Aloe Vera is organic and comes from the USA! I feel confident using this product on my children’s delicate skin and know that it is a product and company that I can trust! It’s REAL Aloe and in the past I had noticed with most of the kinds I found at drug stores that wasn’t the case! The great reviews on this product are not just hype! I have experienced no cons and plan to make this my Aloe Vera choice from now on! I received this product to try out, however, these thoughts and opinions are all my own!</li>
    <li> Really love this aloe so far. I&#x27;ve been using it as a moisturizer (with a few drops of jojoba oil added) from head to toe and it&#x27;s really transformed my skin. I noticed a more even skin tone already. I&#x27;ve also been using this in my hair and my hair is extra shiny. Will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I will start out with my skin condition. I am in my early 20s, I have sensitive, normal to dry skin, and I am not prone to breakouts. However, I do get these tiny bumps on my cheeks that you can see in certain lighting and at a certain angle. Also, because my skin is very sensitive, I get irritation bumps easily from almost anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year ago, I decided to use natural and organic products, starting with the oils. Unfortunately, the oils did not work out for me and made my skin worse. The oils didn&#x27;t break me out in typical acne/pimples, but I did start to get more bumps on my cheeks and my eye area. In light of the oil fiasco, I went back to my not-very-natural skin care products, which helped my skin return to its normal state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later, around this time, I decided to give natural and organic another try. I thought, why not give aloe vera a chance? After much research, I decided to go with Earth&#x27;s Daughter Aloe Vera Gel because of its high concentration of aloe vera. After a week of using it, I can say that this is by far, THE BEST thing I had put on my face. The bumps on my cheeks and around the eyes have significantly reduced. Of course, this isn&#x27;t a miracle product so I still have bumps here and there, and knowing my skin, these bumps will come and go but will never clear 100%. However, what&#x27;s important is that the bumps are now significantly reduced. Also, almost every day, I get some sort of irritation bumps (that slightly swell more like a bug bite than a pimple). The aloe vera really helped with these bumps. Although my irritation bumps naturally disappear overnight anyway, the aloe vera does quickly relieve the irritation and speed up the healing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as moisturizing is concerned, I still have to use an actual moisturizer because of my dry skin. However, I think if it&#x27;s someone with oily skin, this alone might be moisturizing enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product. It is so cheap in comparison to my high end products and does what they couldn&#x27;t do. This is also my first time writing a review on Amazon, and I am not getting paid for this. The seller is also really helpful and prompt with their email replies. Seriously, give it a try. Even if it ends up not working, use it on your body or as an after shave. You will definitely find a use for it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister who battled breast cancer and she loves it! She went through Chemo and Radiation. This stuff soothed her skin from the radiation burns, and really helped her heal. The company is amazing and has excellent customer service. When shipped the bottle leaked, I contacted them the next day they said they would send her a new bottle out, and wished her good health. The next morning from me contacting them... there was a bottle delivered to her front door! Talk about a wonderful company and product. you can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff! I just want to thank those that I talked to for sending it out so quickly, also checking in on how my sister was doing and if it was working out okay for her. You guys are just amazing! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was planning on dinging one star for the slightly unpleasant smell. It does smell like the aloe vera plant so I can&#x27;t blame the manufacturer. It&#x27;s better than having to deal with strong fragrance that I&#x27;m sensitive to. Otherwise, this is a very good product considering cost/quality. It provides a cooling relief to itchy, dry skin. Will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I was very familiar with the Aloe plant healing properties for a long time and long ago used the plant itself.  I did researched on a lot of products from amazon and other sites.  I read the ingred of Earth Daughter versus other products and E.Daughter has almost 98-99% pure. The pure aloe gel can only come from the plant itself.  This Aloe Gel is part liquid and gel which which I wanted to test and is not a bad product at all and is as close to a pure aloe plant itself and has slight preserv to keep its natural pure state.  I do not use this product on daily basis and had already tried it on a variety of other purposes; cuts, scraps, etc;. Tried it on scratch on skin that hasn&#x27;t healed in quite a long time over 7 months and thought it turned the tissue to a permanant scab with scaring or other problems.  After applying this 2-3 times a day for (2) days the scab actually disappeared and skin tissue began to look normal and was healing!  This Gel by Earth&#x27;s Daughter is close as one can get to the plant itself due to the testing I applied this to on the unhealing tissue I had.  I recommend this product due to the working properties it has</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my face, and I&#x27;m super happy with the results.  The aloe is a bit thin which I don&#x27;t mind at all.  It absorbs quickly and feels great.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted-I like that it is not thick like a gel because I like to use it as a moisturizer on my face.  It not only clears up acne, but  makes my pores look smaller and helps even out skin tone.  I am thoroughly happy with this and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great for reducing frizz. Apply to wet hair, then apply a thin layer of coconut oil. Effective and natural.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Love that it had very little odor.  Showed up very quickly, too.</li>
</ol>
