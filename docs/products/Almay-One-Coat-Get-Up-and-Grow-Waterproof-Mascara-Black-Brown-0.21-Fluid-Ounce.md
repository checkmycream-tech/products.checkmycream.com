### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product!</li>
      <li>I cannot believe how great it is!  </li>
      <li>Perfect mascara for me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best for day wear.</li>
      <li>Very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>This has been great with my contacts!  </li>
      <li>Anyway, I got a great brush out of the get up &amp; grow so that I can use up the tubes of I-color mascara</li>
      <li>Great coverage.</li>
      <li>but its a great buy</li>
      <li>I wear contacts and so I need a mascara that doesn&#x27;t run,,,I also have allergies, and this one works great for me.</li>
      <li>Love this mascara!!</li>
      <li>wand is great, I was super impressed with how even it applied and how it fills out the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good covered.</li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>Almay almost always leaves me very satisfied with their products.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I am pleased to find out that it is also water-proof!</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>Pleased!</li>
      <li>It goes on without clumping and looks nice.  </li>
      <li>I really liked Almay&#x27;s raisin quartz mascara, but can&#x27;t find it anywhere anymore.  </li>
      <li>Have bought this product once again very easy to apply and does the job.</li>
      <li>mascara is fine in some respects - a bushier brush than LashExact which did a good job of coating each lash without making them stick together.  </li>
      <li>Now, this product kind of smears over your top lid and under your eye.</li>
      <li>I saved the great brush and use it in my Almay I-color mascara, sadly no longer made.  </li>
      <li>I love the color and texture of my lashes when using this product, but by the end of the work day, it runs and looks smudgy.</li>
      <li>I just bought it so more time of use</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
      <li>Love this mascara.  </li>
      <li>Great product , price and fast shipping</li>
      <li>This mascara is just OK.</li>
      <li>This is an OK mascara.  </li>
      <li>Might be a tad better than some.  </li>
      <li>is good, looks very natural.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>Clumps easily.  </li>
      <li>The color was fine too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is hypoallergenic and works great for me and my eyes are not red and watery.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very inexpensive, effective, and a bottle lasts for months.</li>
      <li>I had forgotten, but still purchased again after having such great results before.</li>
      <li>Her lashes look good, in a natural way, so I guess I  like it, too.</li>
      <li>far as removing ANY mascara - I always use a good oil-free remover.</li>
      <li>Excellent product for anyone, but especially those with sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>Nothing special, this mascara.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake &amp; comes right off with moisturizer!  </li>
      <li>Amazon thanks for the price, cost a bit more in my neighborhood stores.</li>
      <li>However, I was ready for a new tube of mascara and this seemed like a good idea.  </li>
      <li>If you want to rock a super glam look these aren&#x27;t for you.</li>
      <li>I quickly removed the mascara and rinsed my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear and dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>This mascara may work for most people - but if you are very, very sensitive, watch out!</li>
      <li>My new favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>Gave it away because it wasnt worth returning.</li>
      <li>this product was as good as expected.</li>
      <li>Not such great stuff, but I couldn&#x27;t find well-reviewed natural stuff that was waterproof.</li>
      <li>I love Almay but there are other mascara&#x27;s that go on better.</li>
      <li>just feels SO light and natural!  </li>
      <li>I had to rub some off the brush with a cloth the first couple times I used it.  </li>
      <li>Sure wish I went to a local drugstore for it</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d mostly apply on the ends of the eyelashes, not starting close to the eye, so that the remover can get it off without smearing into your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love Almay because it is really the only mascara that does not irritate my eyes...</li>
      <li>But the effect is not dramatic.</li>
      <li>They are also very sparse, and this product does help them grow.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like that too much.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>Thanks Almay.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll want to use makeup remover (or, gently, coconut oil) to get it</li>
      <li>I bought this because it was supposed to be a hypoallergenic mascara - not that I really needed to replace the Cover Girl LashExact</li>
      <li>This one is really a gem</li>
      <li>all was well until mid-afternoon on day one - granted, a very hot (95) and sticky day, when the mascara apparently began to run a bit - not all that noticeable visibly, but my eyes started to smart and burn.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Almay products for many years due to my skin being very sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>the mascara is easy to apply and diid not run when it got wet.  </li>
      <li>I love that it makes my eyes stand out but looks natural enough, so it&#x27;s not obvious I&#x27;m wearing mascara.</li>
      <li>But if you want a gentle mascara (that skin deep rates pretty well) that won&#x27;t irritate your sensitive eyes than this is it.</li>
      <li>brand new, works well</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it</li>
      <li>This product made my lashes look so long and pretty, but it never felt like I was wearing anything on them!</li>
      <li>I have used various similar products and mostly this is the same.  </li>
      <li>Much better than other mascaras I have recently used.</li>
      <li>It wears pretty well, but I wouldn&#x27;t really call it \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; as it certainly does come off when I go to the gym and sweat just a little.</li>
      <li>It really is waterproof bit wipes off when properly removed.</li>
      <li>I have brown/auburn hair and like to keep my makeup natural looking.  </li>
      <li>anyone has sensitive skin, these are the cosmetics to use.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think the reverse curve of the brush applies the mascara effectively, the formula is on the thin side, so my eyes look like Cleopatra&#x27;s by the time I have my lashes coated.  </li>
      <li>might like the color even when your original eyelash is very black.</li>
      <li>Not a good buy was expecting better from Almay.</li>
      <li>I think I tend to have a bigger issue with this than most, so I can hardly blame it.</li>
      <li>I have to dip the brush back in several times to get the coverage I want on one eye, I don&#x27;t really like that.</li>
      <li>The waterproof doesn&#x27;t run down my face and washes off easily, unlike other waterproof products that require make-up removers or oil.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am probably unusually sensitive - have to be careful what soaps I use and don&#x27;t dare use anything but Simple Soothing Eye Balm (highly recommended!) to moisturize around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Now it goes on pretty well without clumping, but I always worry about the black rings under my eyes and probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
      <li>It coats okay, but doesn&#x27;t provide any dramatic effects.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It separates nicely, it&#x27;s a decent mascara other than smudging.</li>
      <li>I ordered the brown/black, but it really looks black on me.  </li>
      <li>definitely my favorite mascara, and I&#x27;ve tried several in the past few years as my lashes have thinned</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make you look worse, but I&#x27;m not sure it really makes you look any better.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent product for anyone, but especially those with sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> This product made my lashes look so long and pretty, but it never felt like I was wearing anything on them! Other mascaras harden your lashes, almost making them crunchy, and this does not! I love it!</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Worked well in the misty rain that was blown into my face by driving wind out in the elements! No smudging. You&#x27;ll want to use makeup remover (or, gently, coconut oil) to get it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand is great, I was super impressed with how even it applied and how it fills out the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d mostly apply on the ends of the eyelashes, not starting close to the eye, so that the remover can get it off without smearing into your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because of the ingredients. Not such great stuff, but I couldn&#x27;t find well-reviewed natural stuff that was waterproof.</li>
    <li> This is an OK mascara.  It goes on without clumping and looks nice.  But it crumbles by the end of the day, and smudges if it gets wet (sweat, tears, yawning.)  It is also a little difficult to remove.  I saved the great brush and use it in my Almay I-color mascara, sadly no longer made.  The I-color was a great product but it had a lousy plastic bristled brush that made it impossible to apply - I suspect that led to the poor sales, not the product itself.  I digress.  Anyway, I got a great brush out of the get up &amp; grow so that I can use up the tubes of I-color mascara I managed to score.</li>
    <li> A little hard to apply. Needs multiple coats then causes a bit of eye irritation.</li>
    <li> I have used various similar products and mostly this is the same.  Might be a tad better than some.  I just bought it so more time of use will help in my evaluation.</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing it; I couldn&#x27;t believe how much longer my lashes were after using this for a few months. This improvement is gradual but substantial.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive eyes and whenever I use this product my eyes are watery and hurt by late afternoon. I switched to a different mascara and have not had the problem since.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara!! Definitely buying again. Multiplies your lashes in length and quantity</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and make them red.</li>
    <li> A little lumpy.  I love Almay but there are other mascara&#x27;s that go on better.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s waterproof, but not smudge proof.  I normally get dark smudges under my eye throughout the day from this.  It coats okay, but doesn&#x27;t provide any dramatic effects.</li>
    <li> My new favorite mascara. Arrived sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was supposed to be a hypoallergenic mascara - not that I really needed to replace the Cover Girl LashExact I was using, which never got in my eyes.  The Cover Girl mascara may be full of bad stuff, but it&#x27;s really waterproof - doesn&#x27;t seem to run, so it doesn&#x27;t get into my eyes.  However, I was ready for a new tube of mascara and this seemed like a good idea.  Big mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara is fine in some respects - a bushier brush than LashExact which did a good job of coating each lash without making them stick together.  The color was fine too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And all was well until mid-afternoon on day one - granted, a very hot (95) and sticky day, when the mascara apparently began to run a bit - not all that noticeable visibly, but my eyes started to smart and burn.  I quickly removed the mascara and rinsed my eyes.  I recovered, but I won&#x27;t use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am probably unusually sensitive - have to be careful what soaps I use and don&#x27;t dare use anything but Simple Soothing Eye Balm (highly recommended!) to moisturize around my eyes.  This mascara may work for most people - but if you are very, very sensitive, watch out!</li>
    <li> I have brown/auburn hair and like to keep my makeup natural looking.  I really liked Almay&#x27;s raisin quartz mascara, but can&#x27;t find it anywhere anymore.  even though this says it is waterproof, it migrates down my face as the day progresses.  I ordered the brown/black, but it really looks black on me.  goth girl time.  The brush is soft bristled (not like those spiky plastic instruments of torture Almay has in some of their other mascaras!) but I don&#x27;t think the reverse curve of the brush applies the mascara effectively, the formula is on the thin side, so my eyes look like Cleopatra&#x27;s by the time I have my lashes coated.  I love Almay because it is really the only mascara that does not irritate my eyes...ever!  My quest continues to replace my beloved Raisin Quartz mascara  :{</li>
    <li> I love that it makes my eyes stand out but looks natural enough, so it&#x27;s not obvious I&#x27;m wearing mascara.</li>
    <li> Great product , price and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Seems like it&#x27;s already dries out.</li>
    <li> Good covered. No allergy</li>
    <li> Gave it away because it wasnt worth returning. Did nothing for my lashes. Not a good buy was expecting better from Almay.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t&#x27; get this here but I remember liking this product before on a previous purchase. Now, this product kind of smears over your top lid and under your eye. Kind of annoying. But then it&#x27;s actually hard to remove when you do want to take it off?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It separates nicely, it&#x27;s a decent mascara other than smudging. Not particularly volumizing or anything like that.</li>
    <li> This mascara is just OK. I have to dip the brush back in several times to get the coverage I want on one eye, I don&#x27;t really like that. The brush just seems to hold in all of the product, not really getting it to the lashes or something. It wears pretty well, but I wouldn&#x27;t really call it \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; as it certainly does come off when I go to the gym and sweat just a little. I don&#x27;t like that too much. Nothing special, this mascara.</li>
    <li> She has used it for years and requests it by name. Her lashes look good, in a natural way, so I guess I  like it, too.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it</li>
    <li> The black/brown color is not stocked in retail stores often, so I had to resort to ordering on-line.  The waterproof doesn&#x27;t run down my face and washes off easily, unlike other waterproof products that require make-up removers or oil.</li>
    <li> Due to alopecia I have the shortest lashes on the planet. With this mascara I have seen improvement. It doesn&#x27;t clump, or flake, it just stays where you apply it. And my lashes are actually growing. Thanks Almay. Amazon thanks for the price, cost a bit more in my neighborhood stores.</li>
    <li> the mascara is easy to apply and diid not run when it got wet.  It really is waterproof bit wipes off when properly removed.</li>
    <li> I wear contacts and so I need a mascara that doesn&#x27;t run,,,I also have allergies, and this one works great for me.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and I really like it. It is hypoallergenic and works great for me and my eyes are not red and watery.</li>
    <li> I have been using Almay products for many years due to my skin being very sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has sensitive skin, these are the cosmetics to use.</li>
    <li> Have bought this product once again very easy to apply and does the job.</li>
    <li> Ordered this by mistake.  Had meant to order the Almay one coat lengthening.  Figured I would try it.  Clumps easily.  Thought it might decrease if I used it a few times but no luck.</li>
    <li> This is now my ONLY mascara!!  I cannot believe how great it is!  Doesn&#x27;t clump - doesn&#x27;t irritate - just feels SO light and natural!  I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Product seems dried out.  I don&#x27;t care for the shape of the brush, either.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  I like other Almay products, so I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t make you look worse, but I&#x27;m not sure it really makes you look any better.  Very little coverage and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> brand new, works well</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t glide on for me, I have to apply the brushes several times to get the coverage wanted.</li>
    <li> Have bought this item before in Walmart, but hard to get now. I have issues with lashes that break and fall out. They are also very sparse, and this product does help them grow. Just wish they had other colors. I am light complected and don&#x27;t like looking like I have fake eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Why oh why did I ever try something other than my Bare Minerals mascara?? This product has a terrible brush; fat, clumsy, hard to reach lashes near the nose without getting mascara everywhere. It clumps A LOT. Worst of all, a little sweat from the gym has this stuff forming raccoon circles above and below my eyes. I&#x27;ve never used such a terrible product. Sure wish I went to a local drugstore for it b/c you&#x27;re allowed to return opened items you don&#x27;t like. Guess my money&#x27;s going in the trash with the product.</li>
    <li> Perfect mascara for me. I recomended</li>
    <li> definitely my favorite mascara, and I&#x27;ve tried several in the past few years as my lashes have thinned</li>
    <li> So I wouldn&#x27;t use this if you want lashes that look like you are wearing falsies. But if you want a gentle mascara (that skin deep rates pretty well) that won&#x27;t irritate your sensitive eyes than this is it. It does lengthen and define lashes. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell you if it benefits the hair. But the effect is not dramatic. It&#x27;s best for day wear. If you want to rock a super glam look these aren&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> Not too thick or globby like in some mascara&#x27;s and looks very natural on. It stays on all day even with my dry watery eyes till I take it off at nigh.&lt;br /&gt;Very Pleased!</li>
    <li> I love the color and texture of my lashes when using this product, but by the end of the work day, it runs and looks smudgy.</li>
    <li> I need a waterproof mascara due to allergies.  This is the only one I&#x27;ve ever found (and I&#x27;ve done a lot of looking &amp; trying) that doesn&#x27;t either irritate my eyes or make my lashes stiff and uncomfortable.  Even the other Almay One Coat Waterproof mascaras don&#x27;t work for me.  This one is really a gem and I hope that they never discontinue it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as removing ANY mascara - I always use a good oil-free remover. Neutrogena&#x27;s has been my go-to formula for years. It&#x27;s very inexpensive, effective, and a bottle lasts for months.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I recommend it</li>
    <li> The Almay One Coat Get Up and Grow Waterproof isn&#x27;t as smear proof as others I have used.  I had to rub some off the brush with a cloth the first couple times I used it.  Now it goes on pretty well without clumping, but I always worry about the black rings under my eyes and probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This mascara is NOT waterproof as advertised.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara.  Lengthens without being too bulky.  Doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear and dries quickly.  It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
    <li> I am pleased to find out that it is also water-proof! I had forgotten, but still purchased again after having such great results before. Almay almost always leaves me very satisfied with their products. This mascara will help re-hydrate lashes (a person can also do that with olive oil or lotion.) And at the same time- this mascara separates, lengthens and and defines lashes. Pairs well with other mascaras.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This has been great with my contacts!  It doesn&#x27;t flake &amp; comes right off with moisturizer!  Would buy again in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> There are only a few mascaras out there that are completely smudge-proof, and this one didn&#x27;t quite do it for me.  I think I tend to have a bigger issue with this than most, so I can hardly blame it.</li>
    <li> Much better than other mascaras I have recently used. This does irritate my eyes every few days when I wear it, but not everyday. Great coverage.</li>
    <li> this product was as good as expected. i use it often. the only thing is, dont use alot else you may feel it clumping on your lashes. but its a great buy</li>
    <li> It obviously make my eyelashes look long.&lt;br /&gt;Color is good, looks very natural.&lt;br /&gt;You might like the color even when your original eyelash is very black.</li>
