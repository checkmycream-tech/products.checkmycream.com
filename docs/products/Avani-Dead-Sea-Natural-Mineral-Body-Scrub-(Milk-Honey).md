<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Makes your skin nice a soft.  Great with the Avani Dead Sea Ultra Rich Body Butter (Milk/Honey).</li>
    <li> It was oily and it smelled.  Turned my tub to an ice skating ring.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t any honey in this.  I would have been getting the same results with EVOO  and sugar.  Sorry.  I love the other products.</li>
    <li> I have to say this product really delivered on smell. As far as the product itself... the oil part of the scrub dried up after only a few uses. I kept the plastic slightly attached to the opening and replaced the cap after each use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than a little disappointed. I guess I will just have to wait for bath and body works to have a sale...</li>
    <li> It works good.  I bought it since I use dead sea products.  But there&#x27;s nothing special about it.  I&#x27;d  by it again.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin but didn&#x27;t realize the benefits of a body scrub.  A friend told me why it was so beneficial to exfoliate.  I had bought a more expensive scrub previously but hadn&#x27;t used it.  The first time I used it  I fell in love with the way it softened. my skin..I needed to buy another body scrub and I found Avani Dead Sea Natural Mineral Body Scrub at a much lower price than the prior scrub had been and it worked even better!  My skin fells softer than ever and I haven&#x27;t had the many dry skin problems I usually have especially in the winter.  I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants soft skin.</li>
    <li> This was much too irritating on my sensitive skin, plus it doesn&#x27;t smell very nice or leave skin with any moisture. For those of you who had experienced the same issue, might I recommend looking up drenched sugar scrubs instead. (You&#x27;ll have to google) It&#x27;s much gentler, smells better and leaves behind lots of moisture.</li>
    <li> Love how it exfoliates and moisturizes</li>
    <li> This was the greasiest, smelliest mineral scrub I have purchased.  It smelled like milk that had gone bad and made my skin so greasy and oily that the oil would come off on my clothes and my skin broke out in acne.  My shower would get dangerously slippery when I would use it, too.  Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Feels good on my skin,  Skin feels so smooth after I use it.  Smell is a little strong, but I can deal with it.</li>
    <li> I bought to use on my hands and it works great even without lotion. Of course you will put lotion on but that will make it feel great the whole day. Most scrubs make it soft at the moment and if you put lotion on. This one has emollients in it so that your hands feels soft from exfoliation and more soft because they are moisturized.</li>
    <li> Not so sure about this stuff.  Leaves skin very oily - gotta re-wash to remove.  I think there are better products out there.</li>

    <li> I love the scrub aspect, but had to use a washcloth to get the excessive oils off. Will look for a different brand next time. If I can&#x27;t find anything better, I will return to this because of the good price, and just deal with the oils.</li>
    <li> Felt good on skin long after use.  Kept skin soft all day long.  I have very dry skin in the winter and this product was great relief to my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Would like to find gift sets in this product.</li>
    <li> my mom loved this stuff.</li>
    <li> This product feels nice on the skin but is very oily and makes the shower/tub slippery. It also separates, so you have to sort-of mix it before each use. Not very user-friendly.</li>
    <li> Perfect for before and after shaving!!!</li>
    <li> Avani Dead Sea Natural Mineral Body Scrub is the BEST way to get rid of the dead skin on your feet! It&#x27;s so easy to use. I use it in the shower . I love it!</li>
    <li> Made a mess getting it out of the container. Kind of greasy. Didn&#x27;t really soften my skin much. I enjoyed the body butter better.</li>
    <li> This body scrub made my skin feel like I had lotion on after I dried. Made me feel smooth. I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars because it&#x27;s very liquidy. Lots of scrubbing salts but watery.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! I look forward to using it at least once a week. It truly works for ridding you of dry skin and makes your skin feel baby soft. I also purchased the body lotion and just love it too!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!!  Leaves my skin feeling silky and hydrated.  It took me awhile to find something not too costly, but now that I have, I love it!!  I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Ive been using for over a year now.  It makes my skin so soft.  I have bought it as gifts also.</li>
    <li> This is great.  It leaves your skin silky soft.</li>
    <li> It leaves my skin soft for three days after use. While I am not the biggest fan of the smell, I can live with it because my skin is smooth and luminous. This is an amazing product.</li>
    <li> I love this it works very well on my dry skin in the winter months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one critique is that  the price went up less than a month after I bought it!</li>
    <li> I use this scrub in the shower, especially on my legs.  It just puts a light coat of oil on your skin and scrubs off the dead skin at the same time.  The scent is mild and wonderful and I am very allergic to almost all cosmetic fragrances.  I buy and use as many things as I can that are unscented, including makeup, hair products and cleaning products for the house.  The milk and honey scent doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  I just love the smell.  And my skin keeps from getting dried out when I use this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this body salt.  It is the only one I have ever used that makes my skin look and feel hydrated hours after my shower.</li>
    <li> Great product. Makes your skin feel really soft. Love it. Nice soft scent, not over powering. I was really pleased.</li>
    <li> Very useful after swimming - removes chlorine smell &amp; re-moisturizes skin. Pleasant smell. Will dry out if not used in timely manner once opened.</li>
    <li> This makes your skin feel so smooth and wonderful. It has really helped my dry skin. If you have dry winter skin, this is the product to help.</li>
    <li> I love the way the salt just melts into my skin and leaves it velvety and soft. like Body Shop products, but highly recommend this scrub above their stuff.</li>
    <li> I puchacsed this and just love it, the one problem I had was one scrub came leaking and the whole box was staturated in oil.&lt;br /&gt;Since it came from Isreal, I knew it would not make the trip back, and I do feel 1- is due to me,but stuff happens&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this ti anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Barkrt</li>
    <li> Fast shipment for the Avani product line with the best re-sealable containers for the mud and sea salt body treatment</li>
    <li> I had used a salt scrub from Bath &amp; Body works before I bought this.  That scrub would leave my skin very dry after exfoliating.  This Avani scrub is the complete opposite...it not only exfoliates my skin but leaves it hydrated and silky smooth.  Definitely plan on repurchasing this product.</li>
    <li> After 2 uses, my skin is radiant, firmer, looks younger and healthier. I am sold and am sharing my discovery with everyone I know. I knew about sea salt, but always felt it too expensive. The Avani is so affordable, I will use it forever. Thanks for such a wonderful product at a good price. Sally</li>
    <li> leaves the skin as soft as silk, just be careful in the shower because the floor is a bit slippery.</li>
    <li> Oilier than I had hoped.  Smoothed skin nicely, but oil base seemed to encourage to acne breakouts, even after washing and rinsing thoroughly.  I believe the product may work well for others, but was a poor match to my skin type (moderately oily.)</li>
    <li> try it...this really works..... 13 mores words?...words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words,  words, words, words, words</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a senior citizen (an elderly, as other societies would call us, ) and this product makes my legs and arms feel velvety smooth.  Wisdom of the ages have left their mark, and this mineral body scrub smoothes the bumps and creases.  My skin feels healthy and smooth after application.  Users of all ages will adore this body scrub.</li>
    <li> If you use this product make sure you use a rubber bath mat as this leaves a very slippery residue in your shower and you must wash it off immediatley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this avani dead sea natural mineral body scrub. It is also half the price of buying it from a kiosk at the mall.</li>
    <li> only place I can use this is on my hands and feet. can&#x27;t use it on my face cause it makes me really red. I&#x27;m assuming a reaction.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Feels even better. I received a lot of compliments from my husband. Great for feet , knees, elbows and hands.</li>
    <li> This product works wonderful. Smells good and leaves the skin very soft. I would definitely buy more in the future!</li>
    <li> This feels really good on your skin. It was a little more oily than what I expected, but it made my skin super soft. I will order again.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t pass up this body scrub when I saw the price, but the truth is their are better body scrubs out there. I guess I get what I made for... so I can&#x27;t complain. But I will say I&#x27;ve had better!</li>
    <li> Works good. The grains are pretty big.</li>
    <li> See title...what more need to be said?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmm...13 more words required...seems like old homework assignment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go tigers...have a nice day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Done</li>
