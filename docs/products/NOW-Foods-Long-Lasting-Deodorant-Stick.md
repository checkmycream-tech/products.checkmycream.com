### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It works perfectly for me.</li>
      <li>They can change the package and the label, but this is still the best deodorant ever.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s awesome will not use anything else now.</li>
      <li>Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Works great and no harmful aluminum contained.  </li>
      <li>Great for women suffering from menopause.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for one month and am happy to say the itch is gone.  </li>
      <li>Great price.</li>
      <li>This deodorant is very effective at preventing odors.</li>
      <li>Good buy for the cost.  </li>
      <li>I was not expecting it to work this good</li>
      <li>I have been using it for 8 months now, and absolutely love this product!</li>
      <li>Lovely smelling though!</li>
      <li>This lavender NOW deodorant smells nice and doesn&#x27;t stain clothing.</li>
      <li>When it doesn&#x27;t flake off, it smells nice and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>This stick gives you 3-4 days plus a nice hint of lavender, which is nice because I use after a bedtime shower.</li>
      <li>The best natural deodorant I have ever used!</li>
      <li>Then I found this one that I liked better.</li>
      <li>I was expecting great results as I&#x27;ve heard great things about it, but it leaves chalky white residue all over your armpit and gets on clothes.</li>
      <li>Like others, I used Lavilin for many years.</li>
      <li>Now products are my favorite for sure.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a shock smelling an under-arm smell on yourself after many years.</li>
      <li>This product has a lovely lavender scent.</li>
      <li>The list of ingredients in the NOW deodorant looked safe for me, so I ordered it.</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>The lavender scent is OVERWHELMING.</li>
      <li>Found this and completely satisfied.  </li>
      <li>(I have to apply most deordants before engaging in any strenous activity just to be on the safe side).</li>
      <li>even when very hot I just smell this more.</li>
      <li>The convenience of the bar form is worth A LOT!</li>
      <li>The first month or so, I needed to reapply more than once a day, but after that, the deodorant lasted all day plus for me.  </li>
      <li>Smells great and lasts a long time, just as advertised.  </li>
      <li>It claimed once a week application and this was true until they repackaged the product about 8 years ago.</li>
      <li>but in a form that meant I didn&#x27;t have to get my fingers all full of the stuff as well.</li>
      <li>Cool, eh?</li>
      <li>So if you are looking for an aluminum free deodorant,  your skin isn&#x27;t particularly sensitive, you don&#x27;t mind reapplying after a workout or day in the sun, and you LOVE lavender, than you will probably enjoy this product.</li>
      <li>That may sound like a problem, but it didn&#x27;t factor in too much for me.</li>
      <li>Somehow, this deodorant manages to keep one fresh all day and into the night.  </li>
      <li>So far, hubby will not go more than 2 days before applying.  </li>
      <li>The lavender smells nice, but it&#x27;s not my personal preference.</li>
      <li>oh so fresh.  </li>
      <li>I was hesitant about this deodorant but wanted something more all natural, this does still let you sweat</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother me much now since I am overseas and wear a uniform all day, but I don&#x27;t think I will be able to use this deordant with civilian clothes, especially a tank top.</li>
      <li>For people who have allergies or sensitive skin, be sure you contact the company to ask about all of the ingredients in this product, including the ones not shown in the product description.</li>
      <li>I sweat right through it and the lavender didnt mask anything.</li>
      <li>This deodorant does a good job keeping odor down.  </li>
      <li>I used up the entire stick and really gave it an honest effort</li>
      <li>Looking for an alternate at a better price.  </li>
      <li>I was hesitant to try this, but am so glad that I finally did.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Also, since it&#x27;s not a thick paste, I can apply it more frequently if I need to or if I&#x27;m worried that it will wear off.</li>
      <li>I saw another reviewer here say this product was barely scented, but I strongly disagree.</li>
      <li>The lavender smell is overwhelming and it rubbed off on my clothes every single day, don&#x27;t even think about wearing anything sleeveless!</li>
      <li>Thanks for letting me reiew</li>
      <li>it worked really well.</li>
      <li>Thanks James</li>
      <li>And the price is reasonable about $5.19.</li>
      <li>but not as much as the others.</li>
      <li>My whole family is a fan of lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am very allergic to some of them, so I never opened the bottle.</li>
      <li>I love the lavendar &amp; pine smell is very strong when you first put it on but wears down a little.</li>
      <li>This works pretty well as far as keeping B.O. away, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;long lasting&amp;#34; as advertised.</li>
      <li>What I really like about this product is that I just glide it on like a normal deodorant.</li>
      <li>This is really long lasting, natural, smells great and keeps you totally dry &amp;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of ordering products online due to the hassle involved with delivery, but this is one product I&#x27;m strongly considering to make that sacrifice for.</li>
      <li>This product is worth the extra cost.</li>
      <li>One application lasts about 5-6 days depending on how active I am, and I&#x27;m a guy who sweats profusely and has a strong tendency for body odor.</li>
      <li>Like others, I noticed a decline in the effectiveness of the new formulation.</li>
      <li>A cross between buttered onions and just pure funk!  </li>
      <li>It was much weaker and many longtime users complained.</li>
      <li>I have allergies and very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I do have very sensitive skin though,</li>
      <li>This stick is easy to apply, works just as long as Lavilin (3-4 days for me), and I like the Lavender scent, though it does dissipate over the next hour.</li>
      <li>stick form makes it easy to apply, and the formula&lt;br /&gt;itself, makes it truly long lasting.</li>
      <li>,  but this brand does work, and is so much better for us than the ordinary brands,</li>
      <li>I tried this product in an effort to clear out aluminum based deodorants.  </li>
      <li>But, it does the job, and as an added bonus it is all natural.</li>
      <li>and WOW it lasts all day</li>
      <li>This is coming from someone who usually has one good sweat everyday that would pretty much take out all the other deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>It will get you through a workday if you sit in an air-conditioned office, but if you work up a halfway decent sweat, you will likely have to reapply afterwards.</li>
      <li>If you really want a long lasting, natural, deodorant try this one.  </li>
      <li>This formula is somewhat soft, looser and... not grainy-er, but has some larger particles of what comprises the product.</li>
      <li>As long as I shave first, this typically lasts me five to seven days, through showers, workouts, and screaming busy kids.</li>
      <li>I first found one that was a cream in a little jar and</li>
      <li>did an experiment to see if it does last a few days straight, and wow it did.</li>
      <li>It also helps me with perspiration, but that may be partially because I normally don&#x27;t sweat alot.</li>
      <li>The lavender scent is mild, but it is noticeable, at least to me (the wearer.)</li>

<li> This deodorant works well, and it holds up all day long.</li>

<li> It also doesn&#x27;t last as long as I expected.</li>
<li> I keep getting massive whiffs of it throughout the day, and I feel like I can&#x27;t wear any other fragrance/perfume with this since it will have to compete with the pervasive, sinus-clearing, lavender odor.</li>
<li> If you apply too much, these little balls of wax  or whatever will drop off of you in a few hours.</li>
<li> Just as it says, It lasts long!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This deodorant works well, and it holds up all day long. I apply it about  8:00 AM and it keeps on working until I take my nightly shower about 10:00 PM. This lavender NOW deodorant smells nice and doesn&#x27;t stain clothing. And the price is reasonable about $5.19.</li>
    <li> Finally found a deodorant that works for me.</li>
    <li> If you really want a long lasting, natural, deodorant try this one.  I&#x27;ve tried Tom&#x27;s long lasting and it doesn&#x27;t compare to this one.</li>
    <li> I tried this product in an effort to clear out aluminum based deodorants.  The product claims to be long lasting but I found myself stinky within just hours of application.  I used up the entire stick and really gave it an honest effort but I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this product.  The lavender smell is overwhelming and it rubbed off on my clothes every single day, don&#x27;t even think about wearing anything sleeveless! Once the lavender smell combines with natural body odor the smell becomes putrid and I found myself constantly washing my armpits to try and dial it down a bit.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works well after a few applications.  Be careful not to let it get on your shirts.  Rub it in a bit..............  No irritation and my wife likes the smell.  Good buy for the cost.  Thanks James</li>
    <li> This is really long lasting, natural, smells great and keeps you totally dry &amp; oh so fresh.  Thanks for letting me reiew</li>
    <li> This product was so grainy that it scratched my underarms and was very uncomfortable to apply!  It also had clumps of product that came off all over the place on application---had to wipe the bathroom counter and floor each time I used it.  Not a good thing!</li>
    <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. Great for women suffering from menopause.  That menopause, underarm stench is almost unbearable.  A cross between buttered onions and just pure funk!  Somehow, this deodorant manages to keep one fresh all day and into the night.  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Didnt work for me. I sweat right through it and the lavender didnt mask anything. I wouldnt buy it again.</li>
    <li> The convenience of the bar form is worth A LOT! This formula is somewhat soft, looser and... not grainy-er, but has some larger particles of what comprises the product. If you apply too much, these little balls of wax  or whatever will drop off of you in a few hours. That may sound like a problem, but it didn&#x27;t factor in too much for me. Just try not to get distracted when applying it. The lavender scent is mild, but it is noticeable, at least to me (the wearer.) It is not strong or unpleasant, but I do prefer Lavalin for this reason. Also, overall, Lavalin is a smoother, denser product than the NOW stick. I&#x27;m contemplating buying a second NOW stick but will see what else is out there. The product does work.</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s brand doesn&#x27;t work. it&#x27;s a shock smelling an under-arm smell on yourself after many years.,  but this brand does work, and is so much better for us than the ordinary brands,</li>
    <li> I have never had a deodorant that works like this one. I was not expecting it to work this good but I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I did an experiment to see if it does last a few days straight, and wow it did. I love this and I will stick with this deodorant from now on and please don&#x27;t stop making it!</li>
    <li> Was introduced to a product called Lavillin about 45 years ago. It claimed once a week application and this was true until they repackaged the product about 8 years ago. It was much weaker and many longtime users complained. This stick gives you 3-4 days plus a nice hint of lavender, which is nice because I use after a bedtime shower.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural deodorant, similar to Lavilin, which I have used in the past. This stick is easy to apply, works just as long as Lavilin (3-4 days for me), and I like the Lavender scent, though it does dissipate over the next hour. Great price. Now I&#x27;d like a smaller version for travel!</li>
    <li> Because this stuff doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star. Not only did it make me itch like deodorants with aluminum in them, it didn&#x27;t last half the day and it smells horrible, especially when you open the container and smell it. it smells like medicated lavender and is very thick, you definitely have to rub it in or not use too much. i only gave it one day but that was all i needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since tried using simply coconut oil and baking soda and WOW it lasts all day and I don&#x27;t smell at all, even the next day I don&#x27;t have morning funk. This is coming from someone who usually has one good sweat everyday that would pretty much take out all the other deodorants I&#x27;ve tried. Sweating is also reduced with coconut oil and baking soda so I&#x27;m not worried about having to wear dark clothes to hide my sweating.</li>
    <li> They can change the package and the label, but this is still the best deodorant ever. As long as I shave first, this typically lasts me five to seven days, through showers, workouts, and screaming busy kids.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is very effective at preventing odors. I use it daily after my morning shower, go to work all day, and to the gym the next morning and there is absolutely no trace of any sweat scent at all. I like it because I don&#x27;t have to reapply it often (I have to apply most deordants before engaging in any strenous activity just to be on the safe side). It also helps me with perspiration, but that may be partially because I normally don&#x27;t sweat alot. The only reason I rated this product as four stars and not five is that it leaves a very white thick layer under your arms after you apply it. It doesn&#x27;t bother me much now since I am overseas and wear a uniform all day, but I don&#x27;t think I will be able to use this deordant with civilian clothes, especially a tank top. But, it does the job, and as an added bonus it is all natural. Now products are my favorite for sure.</li>
    <li> I was expecting great results as I&#x27;ve heard great things about it, but it leaves chalky white residue all over your armpit and gets on clothes. It also doesn&#x27;t last as long as I expected.</li>
    <li> Infective for my body chemistry and the biggest greasy white flaky mess !!!&lt;br /&gt;Pregnancy hormones forever changed my pits :( and Ive tried lots.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m making this #1 on my growing list of tried and failed non-aluminum options-Now,Toms&#x27; of Main, Crystal, Crystal essence,Arm n Hammer,Trader joes , Nature gate.  Ive also tried baking soda, lemon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Silver Sheild- found here on amazon did work but-burned soo bleepin bad I tear up, and a layer of skin turns brown and flakes off&lt;br /&gt; Im currently taking a break from my search and using Sercret- an aluminum deodorant/antiperspirant and I now can actually wear a shirt twice.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like using commercial stuff with lots of chemicals and aluminium as well so I found one that didn&#x27;t have those elements in them. I first found one that was a cream in a little jar and it worked really well. Then I found this one that I liked better. Same ingredients but in a form that meant I didn&#x27;t have to get my fingers all full of the stuff as well. It works perfectly for me. Also, I can use it once every 4 days or so which means I do not have to put it on every day. That is a plus for me. I&#x27;ve had it last as long as a week, actually. Cool, eh?</li>
    <li> I like this deodorant its like a paste. its chalk white what I like about this deodorant it doesn&#x27;t mess up your clothes. it does get on your clothes a little bit. but not as much as the others.</li>
    <li> Had used Lavilin for years.  Looking for an alternate at a better price.  Found this and completely satisfied.  Actually prefer the stick form vs the cream.</li>
    <li> This product has a lovely lavender scent. The first month or so, I needed to reapply more than once a day, but after that, the deodorant lasted all day plus for me.  I have been using it for 8 months now, and absolutely love this product!</li>
    <li> Smells great and lasts a long time, just as advertised.  My whole family is a fan of lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> The best natural deodorant I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try this, but am so glad that I finally did.&lt;br /&gt;This stick form makes it easy to apply, and the formula&lt;br /&gt;itself, makes it truly long lasting.</li>
    <li> This deodorant has a tendency to clump up, flake off, and fail about 2 hours in. When it doesn&#x27;t flake off, it smells nice and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to spending money on crap hygiene products that don&#x27;t perform as advertised. Alas, tis&#x27; the reality we live in. Not this product though. One application lasts about 5-6 days depending on how active I am, and I&#x27;m a guy who sweats profusely and has a strong tendency for body odor. It also lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve been using this thing for well over a month now, somewhere between 6-8 weeks, and it looks like it&#x27;s still going to last me at least a few more weeks, if not even longer. I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of ordering products online due to the hassle involved with delivery, but this is one product I&#x27;m strongly considering to make that sacrifice for.</li>
    <li> I have allergies and very sensitive skin. The list of ingredients in the NOW deodorant looked safe for me, so I ordered it. When I got it, I read the list of ingredients on the bottle, and there were several that were not shown in the product description on the webpage. I am very allergic to some of them, so I never opened the bottle. I returned the product for a refund, but I had to pay shipping when I ordered it, and when I returned it, so I lost several dollars. For people who have allergies or sensitive skin, be sure you contact the company to ask about all of the ingredients in this product, including the ones not shown in the product description.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well as far as keeping B.O. away, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;long lasting&amp;#34; as advertised. It will get you through a workday if you sit in an air-conditioned office, but if you work up a halfway decent sweat, you will likely have to reapply afterwards. I saw another reviewer here say this product was barely scented, but I strongly disagree. The lavender scent is OVERWHELMING. I keep getting massive whiffs of it throughout the day, and I feel like I can&#x27;t wear any other fragrance/perfume with this since it will have to compete with the pervasive, sinus-clearing, lavender odor. Also, I suspect this may clog pores, since I have gotten a few big cystic zits in my underarms since using this product (not cute!), that stopped when I discontinued using it.  I do have very sensitive skin though, so I didn&#x27;t deduct a star for that, but thought I&#x27;d point it out for other sensitive-skinned folks. So if you are looking for an aluminum free deodorant,  your skin isn&#x27;t particularly sensitive, you don&#x27;t mind reapplying after a workout or day in the sun, and you LOVE lavender, than you will probably enjoy this product. It just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about this deodorant but wanted something more all natural, this does still let you sweat but it does not let you smell like you&#x27;ve been sweating. I love the lavendar &amp; pine smell is very strong when you first put it on but wears down a little. even when very hot I just smell this more. it&#x27;s awesome will not use anything else now.</li>
    <li> Like others, I used Lavilin for many years. Like others, I noticed a decline in the effectiveness of the new formulation. I used to go for five days or even longer without needing to apply deodorant. The new formula has been lasting maybe a day and a half. Since I have grown accustomed to not applying deodorant daily, I wanted to see whether there was a product that could duplicate these results without using aluminum. After reading the reviews here, I decided to give the Now Foods product a try. I put some on three days ago. Yesterday, I went to the gym, did heavy cardio work, and showered. I did not put on deodorant. This evening, I noticed something. No smell in the pits! What I really like about this product is that I just glide it on like a normal deodorant. There&#x27;s no waiting for other deodorants to wear off. There&#x27;s no leaving a layer on over night and then washing it off. It&#x27;s just wash and glide it on. Simple as that. Also, since it&#x27;s not a thick paste, I can apply it more frequently if I need to or if I&#x27;m worried that it will wear off.</li>
    <li> Works okay but I have to reapply it throughout the day. Lovely smelling though!</li>
    <li> worse product,waste of money</li>
    <li> Works great and no harmful aluminum contained.  Have used this for years. I can&#x27;t use the regular deodorants as they cause a painful rash.</li>
    <li> I switched off of traditional antiperperants  as they were causing severe itching.  I&#x27;ve been using this for one month and am happy to say the itch is gone.  This deodorant does a good job keeping odor down.  It took a few days to work and I still need to apply daily but I would not expect any product to last 3-5 days on one application.  This product is worth the extra cost.</li>
    <li> Just as it says, It lasts long!  I would have given it 5 stars if it had the same scent as the NOW Foods deodorant in a pot.  The lavender smells nice, but it&#x27;s not my personal preference.</li>
    <li> still waiting for it to kick in, maybe?  So far, hubby will not go more than 2 days before applying.  He says he doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s working.</li>
