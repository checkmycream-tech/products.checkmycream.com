      <li>I absolutely LOVE this color.</li>
      <li>They are better quality, even if they don&#x27;t have that many color choices.</li>
      <li>This is also the most \\&quot;shrinking\\&quot; color that I have from OPI.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Like many darker Gelcolor polishes, it tends to shrink quite a bit.</li>
      <li>Wonderful, great, long lasting, would buy more!</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if its OPI to blame or someone filled it with something else.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work so well with a UV light.  </li>
      <li>This nail polish is a great color and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>Great color, just takes a LONG time.  </li>
      <li>I love being able to change the colors weekly, or leave it for the three weeks that gel nails are renowned to last. :)</li>
      <li>Pretty color and love the staying power of gel polish.</li>
      <li>I am on day 10 of this color on my nails and they still look great without a single chip or mark on them.</li>
      <li>Item arrived as described and on time, color is super cute, I received lots of compliments the first time I wore it.  </li>
      <li>For those who love to get nails done at the salon, this is a fantastic alternative to the high prices.  </li>
      <li>Love this color of OPI Gelcolor-great shade of darker purple- not too bright and not too dark.</li>
      <li>Other than that it was great.</li>
      <li>Product was exactly as described!</li>
      <li>It takes at least 3, maybe 4 coats to get a good color, and every coat leaves more opportunity for error.</li>
      <li>Shrinking meaning that as I apply it it instantly comes away from the sides and free edge, which makes it more problematic.</li>
      <li>pretty.</li>
      <li>The color is a close match if not an exact match to the color swatch shown.</li>
      <li>Pretty color.</li>
      <li>Nice dark grape purple.</li>
      <li>I really prefer Sensationail polishes.</li>
      <li>I assumed OPI gel would be even better, because I like their regular nail polishes, but this was a huge waste of money and time.</li>
      <li>Even with very thin amount on brush, not getting great coverage.</li>
      <li>True to the handle on the bottle, Mouvre Me Not is a deep purplish leaning red and looked fantastic when dry.</li>
      <li>Which is fine if you&#x27;ve got an hour and a half.</li>
      <li>I love this color not only for the dark classy purple shade but also for the &#x27;jelly bean&#x27; look.</li>
      <li>It does take a few coats to get good coverage, but the thinner the coats the less chances of peeling anyway and</li>
      <li>Needed a little help to get the top open.</li>
      <li>It is perhaps my favorite OPI color, however you have you put AT LEAST 4 coats on to get the color pictured on the bottle.</li>
      <li>After curing color is pretty just doesn&#x27;t compare well to other gels imo</li>
      <li>Pools and hard to cap free edge.</li>
      <li>Most dark gel polishes have issues with shrinking and pooling, the solution to help that is to cure after each nail for a few seconds.  </li>
      <li>It looks decent, just not what I expected.  </li>

    <li> The color was off on this one.  I was expecting the dark purple that everyone raved about but ended up with a brownish raisin color.  It looks decent, just not what I expected.  I wish I could just purchase these polishes in a store.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is a great color and lasts a long time. Received product on time! Wonderful, great, long lasting, would buy more!</li>
    <li> This polish goes on very thin. It took 5 coats to get a solid color. When it drys its an ugly greyish green color, not the pretty dark purple I was hoping for. I don&#x27;t know if its OPI to blame or someone filled it with something else. Either way, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> Takes 3 coats to cover. Nice dark grape purple. No glitter. Love it.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as described! Great price, and speedy delivery!  For those who love to get nails done at the salon, this is a fantastic alternative to the high prices.  I love being able to change the colors weekly, or leave it for the three weeks that gel nails are renowned to last. :)</li>
    <li> Love the color! It arrived in perfect condition and super fast too. The color is a close match if not an exact match to the color swatch shown.</li>
    <li> They never disappoint - I bring my DVD colors to my nail salon so that I always get that I want!</li>
    <li> Even with very thin amount on brush, not getting great coverage. Pools and hard to cap free edge. After curing color is pretty just doesn&#x27;t compare well to other gels imo</li>
    <li> Great color, great coverage!  Has a little bit of sparkle to it, but not very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Very pretty. Works as its supposed to.</li>
    <li> Item arrived as described and on time, color is super cute, I received lots of compliments the first time I wore it.  Easy to apply and easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Nice Color and wear them differnt times. I&#x27;m not waitress really good color. Purple is good color to wear. Both nice color to wear them</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work so well with a UV light.  Maybe it works best with an OPI light.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite OPI colors, and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it. Most dark gel polishes have issues with shrinking and pooling, the solution to help that is to cure after each nail for a few seconds.  It does take a few coats to get good coverage, but the thinner the coats the less chances of peeling anyway and the longer they will last!  I am on day 10 of this color on my nails and they still look great without a single chip or mark on them. I would recommend this line and color to anyone!</li>
    <li> Pretty color and love the staying power of gel polish. Needed a little help to get the top open. Other than that it was great.</li>
    <li> True to the handle on the bottle, Mouvre Me Not is a deep purplish leaning red and looked fantastic when dry.</li>

I assumed OPI gel would be even better, because I like their regular nail polishes, but this was a huge waste of money and time. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love this color of OPI Gelcolor-great shade of darker purple- not too bright and not too dark. This is a simple at home system to do gel nails.</li>
    <li> I use this with Kiss base and top coat and it has lasted 3 weeks. The color is really nice. it&#x27;s kind of shear so to get the deep color you need 3 coats but because it&#x27;s shear-ish, the color you get is really nice. I absolutely love and recommend it!</li>
    <li> I gave this item as well as one other OPI get color as a gift to a very good friend, and she was extremely happy with both of them.  Pretty color.</li>
    <li> Bottle arrived empty. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this color. It is perhaps my favorite OPI color, however you have you put AT LEAST 4 coats on to get the color pictured on the bottle. Which is fine if you&#x27;ve got an hour and a half. The last time I used this (today) I actually did 6 coats. So, yeah. Great color, just takes a LONG time.  This is also the most \\&quot;shrinking\\&quot; color that I have from OPI. Shrinking meaning that as I apply it it instantly comes away from the sides and free edge, which makes it more problematic.</li>
    <li> I love this color not only for the dark classy purple shade but also for the &#x27;jelly bean&#x27; look. It takes me 3 coats to achieve coverage. Like many darker Gelcolor polishes, it tends to shrink quite a bit. The trick to keep the polish from shrinking is to flash cure each nail for 5 to 10 seconds before moving on to the next finger. Once done with the whole hand, cure as usual. Also, don&#x27;t forget to shake the bottle well once in a while.</li>
