      <li>Premium Mirrored Aviator Top Gun Sunglasses</li>
      <li>love the scent - it is like being a teenager again.  </li>
      <li>I think they would reel in a lot more customers that way.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s flush at the top.</li>
      <li>(And yes I added an ‘I’ to make up those two words because nothing describes shampooing with Sassoon better.)</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>shampoo itself is silky and smooth with a nice consistency.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s not too overwhelming.</li>
      <li>She was pleased with the result of her experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This review&#x27;s rating is based mostly on delivery condition of the product.</li>
      <li>It was ok, but I found the smell more baby-powdery than cherry almond.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent -</li>
      <li>It leathers up nicely and makes your hair feel clean and</li>
      <li>It smelled like sweet almonds and was amazing.</li>
      <li>While the scent of the shampoo is pleasant and the quality is reflective of Vidal Sassoon, delivery to a home address has much to be desired.  </li>
      <li>it is the delicious scent -- a mix of almonds, cherries, and just an overall sweet smell.</li>
      <li>I guess more importantly</li>
      <li>Made my hair feel like straw, doesn&#x27;t really smell that good.</li>
      <li>What a shame, because the original was lovely.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Vidal Sassoon Cherry Almond Classic Clean Shampoo is an excellent product at a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>The conditioner smell was so strong is induced migraines.</li>
      <li>It foams nicely and has a pretty, lingering almond scent.</li>
      <li>This was the first mass-market shampoo that was branded to seem sexy and sophisticated, not bubbly and squeaky-clean.</li>
      <li>Seemed to wash my hair fine, however.  </li>
      <li>Cherry Almond is fine quality</li>
      <li>It had a lovely, fragrant aroma - not cherry, but sweet and clean smelling.  </li>
      <li>It moisturizes, leaving the hair smooth, and silky.</li>
      <li>I do wish they would make a sulfate free option</li>
      <li>, that&#x27;s important).</li>
      <li>THANK YOU for bring this back and at a great price.</li>
      <li>The scent is light, so it isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
      <li>-- you can tell it&#x27;s cherry almond, but it doesn&#x27;t overpower you and it isn&#x27;t obnoxious once the hair dries, which is good for all of those who are sensitive to fragrances (as I tend to be).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love cherry-scented and almond-scented items, so I was ready to love this.  </li>
      <li>The description is accurate when it says it has a unique scent.</li>
      <li>Vidal Sassoon Cherry Almond Classic Clean Shampoo is a nice product.</li>
      <li>I remember the original 3 step system in the brown bottles, which used to be a shampoo, conditioner and finishing rinse.</li>
      <li>It rinses off cleanly and I like the way my hair and scalp feel after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>is a great way to start or end a busy day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The added benefit and the REAL reason we use shampoo is by what it does and doesn’t</li>
      <li>The product lathers and rinses well and while it got my hair clean</li>
      <li>I had no problems getting my hair clean and didn&#x27;t notice it drying out my hair either.</li>
      <li>she said that her hair felt clean and it was shinny.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Another positive for me is that it is safe for color-treated</li>
      <li>Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s Cherry Almond classic clean shampoo is a lightweight cleanser that is even suitable for color hair.</li>
      <li>Not only does it smell good, but it has visibly improved the softness and shine and has taken a lot of the dryness out of my hair.</li>
      <li>A good basic shampoo.</li>
      <li>For all of those who are in the hunt for a good shampoo that moisturizes, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, doesn&#x27;t strip your hair color, and has a lovely scent, I&#x27;d recommend that you give this product a try.</li>
      <li>The one factor that piqued my interest: the cherry almond scent -- it&#x27;s a particular favorite of mine.  </li>
      <li>I love how this shampoo smells, which was the main reason I decided to try it.</li>
      <li>I used the original scent for many years and opening the bottle was like greeting an old friend.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
      <li>She tells me that this is one of the best shampoos she has used in a long time and it reminds her of the same shampoo they use on her at the hairdresser.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of fun, retro, and provides a perfectly good shampoo experience with a white, reasonably thick, and nicely foaming product.</li>
      <li>Same great product that debuted when I was a newly licensed cosmetologist.</li>
      <li>Not only does it smell AMAZING</li>
      <li>I have forgotten how much I liked Vidal Sassoon hair products, back in the day</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re not worried about that, this is an economical choice that&#x27;s a pleasure to use.</li>
      <li>Fresh lingering and shinny hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Back to the future.  Vidal Sassoon has been around forever.  A quality product. A classic,&lt;br /&gt; The fragrance of Cherry being the first note, second a slight almond fragrance. Fresh lingering and shinny hair.  I normally do not use a conditioner but, know that the matching, Vidal Sassoon Cherry Almond conditioner sets the fragrance  without a heavy texture.  Highly recommended this shampoo and the conditioner that matches.</li>
    <li> This is a basic  surfactant-based shampoo mostly made of sodium laureth sulfate and water. It foams nicely and has a pretty, lingering almond scent. It feels nice, rinses out easily, and left my hair clean, soft, and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this shampoo 4 stars instead of 5 because SLS is controversial. If you&#x27;re not worried about that, this is an economical choice that&#x27;s a pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> So very reminiscent scent, takes me back. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be over powering or not a good product but both the shampoo were lightly scented and just left a fresh but the same cherry-almond scent. And they are very good products and safe for colored hair. I will buy them both again!</li>
    <li> I love how this shampoo smells, which was the main reason I decided to try it. The shampoo itself was simply average. I currently use a shampoo that really moisturizes my hair, but the Vidal Sassoon wasn&#x27;t as good.</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s Cherry Almond classic clean shampoo is a lightweight cleanser that is even suitable for color hair. It leathers up nicely and makes your hair feel clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, after using this product you may find yourself having the urge to purchase the following: [[ASIN:B00L285FAE Hue Women&#x27;s Chunky Legwarmer]], [[ASIN:B002XHFK6M Maybelline New York Shinesensational Lip Gloss, Watermelon Punch 80, 0.38 Fluid Ounce]], [[ASIN:B0001GN7GM Lauren Silva Wedge Style Women&#x27;s Shoulder Pads Style 0777]], and [[ASIN:B00DU1PJ7U Premium Mirrored Aviator Top Gun Sunglasses w/ Spring Loaded Temples (3-Pack (Mixed Colors))]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when you are in the grocery line or on the bus after using this shampoo, don&#x27;t be surprised if the stranger next to you suddenly starts humming [[ASIN:B0013832A8 Eye of the Tiger]] or [[ASIN:B004X5RVSC Total Eclipse Of The Heart]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t believe me? Try it and see.</li>
    <li> Like others reviewing this product, I used to use Vidal Sassoon shampoo a long time ago - like way back in the 70&#x27;s.  But as I recall the one I used came in a brown container and I don&#x27;t remember the scent, only that it was not a typical shampoo scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have this new product that comes in a red container.  The shampoo is a creamy white color, not the clear thinner liquid I remember from the past. So much for nostalgia. But as far as the shampoo goes, I like this new one very much. The cherry almond aroma smells natural, like real food instead of a chemical smell and it actually makes me hungry thinking of dessert.  The texture of the shampoo is very nice, too - thick enough so it doesn&#x27;t go spilling all over the place, yet thin enough to easily distribute and lather up on my scalp (I&#x27;m a guy, by the way, with short hair so I have no idea how this would be for long hair).  It rinses off cleanly and I like the way my hair and scalp feel after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars because I like everything about this shampoo - aroma, texture, cleaning ability and ease of rinsing.</li>
    <li> My hair has been clean and soft after the use of this produce. The scent is pleasant and not overwhelming it reminds me of cherry bakewell tart.</li>
    <li> There are some shampoo scents that immediately bring me back to the 1970s. One is Clairol&#x27;s original Herbal Essence shampoo, unfortunately discontinued years ago and replaced with Herbal Essences; the other is Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s Cherry Almond shampoo, originally issued back in 1977 or so and now back with the original scent. It&#x27;s kind of fun, retro, and provides a perfectly good shampoo experience with a white, reasonably thick, and nicely foaming product. Don&#x27;t forget that you&#x27;ll want the matching conditioner.</li>
    <li> This review&#x27;s rating is based mostly on delivery condition of the product. While the scent of the shampoo is pleasant and the quality is reflective of Vidal Sassoon, delivery to a home address has much to be desired.  Maybe the problem is that I live at a higher elevation?  Does the pressure build up in the bottle, only to explode its contents?  I am thankful that Amazon placed the shampoo in a plastic bag, prior to shipping.</li>
    <li> I really disliked this shampoo. Usually I like a product with a strong scent but this product&#x27;s scent brings back memories of old hair salons and my god mother&#x27;s cellar where she cut hair (mine badly) for decades. The product lathers and rinses well and while it got my hair clean it left it flat and lifeless the several times I used it. This isn&#x27;t a product I&#x27;d recommend or use again.</li>
    <li> Most of the time I use a cleansing conditioner, but I like to have a bottle of shampoo on hand as well for the occasional use. This is a good one; it smells nice (and the scent doesn&#x27;t linger, that&#x27;s important). It does not claim to condition, and it doesn&#x27;t... the hair feels rough and there&#x27;s drag when combing through the wet hair, but it sudses up nicely, rinses easily, and cleans the hair well. A good basic shampoo.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I bought this because I was feeling nostalgic. The smell takes me back to the 80&#x27;s - and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else but Amazon. The shampoo is nice and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out, and the smell is exactly as I remember it.</li>
    <li> The results were WAY beyond my expectations</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about this shampoo. The first thing you notice as soon as you open it is the delicious scent -- a mix of almonds, cherries, and just an overall sweet smell. But it&#x27;s not too overwhelming. When your hair dries the scent does fade but you can still smell hints of it -- just enough. The description is accurate when it says it has a unique scent. It is hard to put into words! But it&#x27;s definitely a natural smell and there&#x27;s nothing artificial about it. That&#x27;s something that bothers me about other scented products. And I have to agree with other reviewers that it smells good enough to eat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I guess more importantly, it works great on my hair. I have noticed an improvement in the softness, fullness, and shine of my hair since I started using it about a month ago. It definitely does not feel heavy or weighted down and there&#x27;s no build-up after using it for an extended period of time. It also doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. My hair ends especially tend to get dried out easily. I have noticed an improvement with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another positive for me is that it is safe for color-treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself is silky and smooth with a nice consistency. It&#x27;s not runny at all but not too thick either. You don&#x27;t need to use a large amount. And again, I just love the smell when washing my hair! The whole bathroom smells great when I&#x27;m finished -- so it doubles as a room freshener! I have not used Vidal Sassoon before so I am definitely impressed with this brand.&lt;br /&gt;I really want to try the conditioner now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do highly recommend this shampoo. It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m another one for whom nostalgia wasn&#x27;t a factor when I chose to try this product.  Also, it wasn&#x27;t brand recognition that made my decision for me, as I&#x27;ve found Vidal Sassoon products to be hit or miss when it comes to my long, coarse, thick, curly/wurly, color-treated hair. The one factor that piqued my interest: the cherry almond scent -- it&#x27;s a particular favorite of mine.  When I used the shampoo, I really enjoyed that aspect of it -- you can tell it&#x27;s cherry almond, but it doesn&#x27;t overpower you and it isn&#x27;t obnoxious once the hair dries, which is good for all of those who are sensitive to fragrances (as I tend to be).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product yields a fairly good amount of lather, but even after two washings, it didn&#x27;t strip my hair of all of its moisture and leave it a tangled, uber-dry mess as other shampoos often do.  Instead, my hair felt soft and smooth, and I could even run my fingers through it in the shower before I applied conditioner.  Once my hair dried, there was a good amount of shine, bounce, and manageability, and it didn&#x27;t weigh down my curls at all, nor did I detect any noticeable fading of my hair color.  This definitely exceeded my expectations on all levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with the results that I got from this shampoo; so pleased, in fact, that I&#x27;m going to make it a point to pick up the conditioner that&#x27;s a part of this line.  For all of those who are in the hunt for a good shampoo that moisturizes, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, doesn&#x27;t strip your hair color, and has a lovely scent, I&#x27;d recommend that you give this product a try.</li>
    <li> Nice for a daily shampoo.  The scent is nice too...I had to go out and buy the cream rinse because I liked the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, stronger than I remembered. Wish it still came in the old brown bottle.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, takes only a small amount even with really long hair. I purchased the almond classic conditioner too and like it as well. This was recommended by a friend and I would recommend it as well.</li>
    <li> The smell is out of this world!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product. It&#x27;s tha same as what my mom used back in the 80&#x27;s. The price is right too. I buy the matching conditioner also!</li>
    <li> THIS SMELLS SO DANG GOOOOOOD!!!</li>
    <li> Fekkai?!! really? Love it</li>
    <li> While this smells fantastic it left my hair very dry and super flat/straight it managed to be heavy enough to take my natural waves of of my hair. The conditioner smell was so strong is induced migraines. I wasn&#x27;t happy with either.</li>
    <li> I love cherry-scented and almond-scented items, so I was ready to love this.  It was ok, but I found the smell more baby-powdery than cherry almond.  The scent is light, so it isn&#x27;t overpowering.  Seemed to wash my hair fine, however.  It reminded me a little of Jergens lotion, whose &amp;#34;cherry-almond&amp;#34; is also a little like baby powder/flowery.  Not as good as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
    <li> When I was a teenager in the 80s, Vidal Sassoon was the shampoo to get---the really good stuff.  Over the years, it seems that has become less the case, but I think this edition might bring it back!  This shampoo has a wonderful scent.  Cherry Almond might not sound like something that would work as a shampoo scent, but it does---it was quite a treat to smell!  The shampoo lathers up like crazy.  I know not everyone likes lots of lather, but I really do.  It left my hair looking better than it has in a long time, and did the same thing with my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Her hair has a tendency to be very fly-away, and this seemed to control it and give it body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to seek this out on my next shampoo shopping trip!</li>
    <li> This is a lovely lightweight shampoo that isn&#x27;t horribly drying to my hair.  My hair is quite long - almost waist length and I have a lot of natural curl.  Some shampoo and conditioners dry my hair so much that it gets frizzy and flyaway while others over moisture and knock out all of my curl while making my hair feel greasy.  This shampoo (and also the conditioner) does neither of those two things.  I have just the right amount of moisture in my hair to allow the curl to have its way but my frizzy hairs are still under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent - it is like being a teenager again.  I used the original scent for many years and opening the bottle was like greeting an old friend.  However, the shampoo is even better than it was back in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to all of the above, the price on this product is extremely reasonable.  I can buy a bottle for both my shower and for my guest bathroom and still save money over the other brands I have purchased in the past.  I really enjoyed the shampoo and recommend it to anyone - the scent is gender neutral so it is the perfect choice for the guest bathroom.</li>
    <li> When I received this shampoo, I immediately asked my wife to use it instead of her usual brand.  She said OK.  When she came out of the shower and dried her hair I asked for her opinion.  The first thing she did was to ask me to smell her hair, which I did.  It had a lovely, fragrant aroma - not cherry, but sweet and clean smelling.  Also, her hair felt soft to the touch.  She was pleased with the result of her experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I took my shower I poured out a small amount of the shampoo in the palm of my hand and immediately noticed the fairly strong aroma, which became even stronger when I began to wash my hair.  I was surprised by just how strong the smell was, not exactly cherry, but flowery.  The shampoo fully lathers up just as I expected.  Again, not much product is needed.  I rinsed out the shampoo, dried my hair, and then ran my hands through my hair - very soft and manageable, which it is right now a day later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vidal Sassoon Cherry Almond Classic Clean Shampoo is an excellent product at a reasonable price.  We now have a new shampoo at our house.</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon Cherry Almond Classic Clean Shampoo leaves my hair soft and shiny. There are no frizzies or dry ends. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stripped like many products do. I color my hair and have not noticed the color fading any sooner. It does not make the color last any longer though. I can use it daily without worrying about it damaging my hair. I appreciate the flip top instead if a screw cap. Nothing to drop or lose in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this brand many years ago and really liked it then. I&#x27;m thrilled that it&#x27;s back with the same scent and results.</li>
    <li> Another great hair care product from Vidal Sassoon. I picked this up for my girlfriend and she loves it. When she uses it along with the matching conditioner her hair looks great. And the cherry almond scent smells really good. And the scent lasts but it is not overpowering. She tells me that this is one of the best shampoos she has used in a long time and it reminds her of the same shampoo they use on her at the hairdresser.</li>
    <li> Same great product that debuted when I was a newly licensed cosmetologist.</li>
    <li> First off I like the design &amp; function of the cap. It&#x27;s flush at the top. A simple push opens, as you squeeze its velvety silky fluid spills into your hand. It lathers up real well, plus it rinses out in a flash. The overall results look and the cherry almond smell puts the finishing touches on a shampoo that gets her done as advertised. When you take price into consideration, it is a good deal.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells AMAZING! Cleans exceedingly well and leaves my hair feeling very soft. I greatly enjoyed this shampoo and will definitely be using it again.</li>
    <li> I love Vidal Sassoon products and the Cherry Almond Shampoo is no different. Not only does it smell AMAZING but it also leaves my hair feeling clean, shiny and ready for the day. Did I mention it smells amazing? Perfect for men or women due to the cherry almond scent and works just as great in men&#x27;s hair as it does in women&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon Cherry Almond Classic Clean Shampoo is a nice product. I have forgotten how much I liked Vidal Sassoon hair products, back in the day this was a very popular item.  I do wish they would make a sulfate free option I think they would reel in a lot more customers that way.  I had no problems getting my hair clean and didn&#x27;t notice it drying out my hair either. I&#x27;m not much a fan of fruity smelling hair shampoos so thus only 4 stars.</li>
    <li> We try new shampoos all the time at our house. Vidal Sassoon is one we haven&#x27;t used in several years, so it was nice to take this scent out for a spin. The Cherry Almond scent is pretty strong when you&#x27;re washing your hair, especially the cherry, which is more like maraschino cherry rather than ripe bing cherries, for instance. Once you&#x27;ve rinsed it out though, the scent it leaves is mild and pleasant. I liked the way it left my hair feeling soft, as if I&#x27;d already used conditioner. I think I&#x27;ll give the Vidal Sassoon conditioner a try now, since the shampoo is a winner.</li>
    <li> Judging a shampoo based solely on its smell is like judging a book on its cover! However, if I had to base my review purely on the scent of this shampoo, I would still give it five stars. Everyone has commented on how good it smells! It is like a cherry sucker. But I also would like to say some things about the way this leaves my hair feeling. Not only does it smell good, but it has visibly improved the softness and shine and has taken a lot of the dryness out of my hair. I paired it with the conditioner and I have to say I am happier with this than some of the more expensive shampoos out there. It is wonderful. Rinses clean, keeps my hair soft and manageable, and yeah, it smells really good!</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon always provides a great product and this is no exception.  It cleans your hair and leaves it feeling soft even without conditioner.  I love the scent - maybe because it&#x27;s the scent I grew up with and it reminds me of warm baths on cold nights as a child!</li>
    <li> leaves a very pleasant cherry vanilla scent behind.  I used this product on my color treated hair and it really does help keep my red color fresh.  But when using this shampoo in the wintertime season, it has left my scalp a bit itchy and dry, and I find a few dry flakes when combing.  Although the shampoo does clean my scalp thoroughly, I believe it&#x27;s drying out my skin a bit too much.  Perhaps I can use this product more successfully in the moister, spring and summer months.</li>
    <li> As a kid in the 70s, I thought Vidal Sassoon was the pinnacle of sophistication. This was the first mass-market shampoo that was branded to seem sexy and sophisticated, not bubbly and squeaky-clean. Compared to other shampoos on the market (this is the age of Gee, Your Hair Smells Terrific, Body on Tap and Prell), the packaging was modern and sleek (and it looks pretty much the same, though I remember it being dark brown).  I coveted it immediately and BEGGED my mom to buy it. When she agreed, I was in heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as shampoo goes, this is perfectly fine. Lathers well, rinses cleanly, and leaves your hair clean and shiny, and it is a step above garden variety cheap mass-market shampoo. But the main thing is the scent. It&#x27;s such a blast from the past, and I&#x27;m tickled every time I use it.</li>
    <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this good from shower to bedtime in years. THANK YOU for bring this back and at a great price. Get the Sassoon cherry almond  conditioner too.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel like straw, doesn&#x27;t really smell that good. I love cherry almond fragrance, and there isn&#x27;t enough of it in this to matter. Too bad, I was so looking forward to it.</li>
    <li> This Vital Sassoon Shampoo is gentle on the scalp, and doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down as many shampoos are known to do. It moisturizes, leaving the hair smooth, and silky. In addition, only a small amount is needed per application as it cleans &amp; shines. I&#x27;ve used Vidal Sassoon shampoos over the last 15 years, and never had any problems. It has a pleasant fragrance, not too harsh, and No reactions are noted with this shampoo. I have a sensitive scalp, but this shampoo doesn&#x27;t irritate it, and I can use it on a daily basis, without any worries. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> gave this to the wife to use.  she washed her hair and and boy you can smell the cherry/almond sent.  not over powering, very pleasant.  my wife likes Vidal Sassoon products.  she said that her hair felt clean and it was shinny.  Vidal Sassoon products in my wife&#x27;s book has always been a very good product.</li>
    <li> Of course this smells so heavenly; there should be a label that warns against drinking it.  Shampooing with Sassoon Cherry Almond Shampoo is a totally sensual experience.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great way to start or end a busy day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The added benefit and the REAL reason we use shampoo is by what it does and doesn’t do.&lt;br /&gt;This does treat hair gently; even colored hair.  The bottle states it is also suitable for colored hair.&lt;br /&gt;This does lather up bubbily and creamily. (And yes I added an ‘I’ to make up those two words because nothing describes shampooing with Sassoon better.) This leaves hair shinny. This does not leave hair feeling stripped and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple. Sassoon shampoo is a small and inexpensive way to be good to yourself.</li>
    <li> The lid of a cheerily red bottle snaps open or closed.&lt;br /&gt;The white-hued shampoo has a definite cherry aroma and it lathers quickly and luxuriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SASSOON&#x27;s Cherry Almond is fine quality and I&#x27;ll be most happy to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I remember the original 3 step system in the brown bottles, which used to be a shampoo, conditioner and finishing rinse. It smelled like sweet almonds and was amazing. They brought this back as just shampoo and conditioner, minus the rinse, and the formulas are different. The shampoo is no longer clear, but a milky white &amp;#34;conditioning&amp;#34; formula with silicones. The shampoo/ conditioner combo is just okay on my fine hair, leaving it a little dull &amp; flat. However, what I find most disappointing, is the scent is not the same. It has an artificial, chemical cherry cough syrup type of a scent. It&#x27;s not the lovely almond scent that it used to be. I emailed the company inquiring about the change in the scent, and they admitted it may not be the same. What a shame, because the original was lovely.</li>
