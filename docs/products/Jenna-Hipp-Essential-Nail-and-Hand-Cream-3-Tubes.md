      <li>Wonderful lotion.</li>
      <li>Absolutely perfect.</li>

      <li>Found an amazing price at Costco!</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant, understated herbal scent and seems to do a good job protecting my hands.  </li>
      <li>Love that they are in a space-saving tube - great for travel.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve happily used hand creams from many companies, raging from high-end to drugstore variety.  </li>
      <li>And I have tried so many creams!</li>
      <li>This lotion is amazing.  </li>
      <li>but honestly I don&#x27;t even care, the lotion works so well.</li>
      <li>Best cream I have ever used on my hands - first winter ever I have ever had no splitting of the tips of my fingers, which is a true blessing.  </li>
      <li>great and is not greasy, but works great to care for my dry winter skin.</li>
      <li>I know it is for hands and fingers mostly, but I use it on my feet tool.</li>
      <li>, I use it mostly for my feet because it didn&#x27;t absorb to well on my hands.</li>
      <li>My favorite hand cream.</li>
      <li>be ordering more to keep my supply up.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>love this product--</li>
      <li>My nails look so much better too.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite cream for both my hands and feet.</li>
      <li>Smells great, very lightweight .</li>
      <li>This is the best lotion I have used for dry skin.</li>
      <li>With 20% shea butter, this cream is perfect for the dry skin in the winters.</li>
      <li>It keeps my hands smooth and moisturized but not for many hours though.</li>
      <li>Has a nice fresh scent and leaves hands feeling clean.</li>
      <li>Best hand cream hands down!  </li>
      <li>Also great at work, I type all day and can apply the lotion and get back to work without a greasy film.</li>
      <li>It rubs in smoothly, with no leftover greasiness or stickiness, and has just the slightest fragrance.</li>
      <li>I ordered this last year and loved it in the winter months, so I ordered more again this year.  </li>
      <li>I love this cream and have finished my first tube.</li>
      <li>Great for nurses with dry hands from washing.</li>
      <li>Idk what the affects are but so far loving it</li>
      <li>Overall a good hand cream.</li>
      <li>I like it because it absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel</li>
      <li>After reading many enthusiastic reviews and Oprah&#x27;s recommendation, I bought this 3-pack, only to discover that this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t moisturize very well.  </li>
      <li>One thing I&#x27;m not crazy about</li>
      <li>Arrived right on time.</li>
      <li>My hands are smoother and cuticles are as well, even though I tend to clean house and garden with bothering much with gloves.  </li>
      <li>Thick smells nice and cute packaging.</li>
      <li>I had to buy it when the first three my daughter gave me ran out.  </li>
      <li>So in love with this cream!  Not greasy, but extremely nourishing.  </li>
      <li>Nothing makes my hands feel better after a long day than the Jenna Hipp lotion.  </li>
      <li>17.00$ I absolutely in love!Its not greasy and absorbes quickly and leaves your hands feeling soft.</li>
      <li>I had been using a much pricier hand cream from a well known department-store brand.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Jenna Hipp</li>
      <li>really like having three tubes of Jenna Hipp to stash here and there.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my new miracle cream!</li>
      <li>One of the only lotions that isn&#x27;t greasy and rubs in quick</li>
      <li>Highly recommended...</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend the cream.</li>
      <li>There are a few things I&#x27;m sure aren&#x27;t natural</li>
      <li>A true bartender&#x27;s friend.&lt;br /&gt;Hands are not slippery after application and then coming into contact with water.&lt;br /&gt;Great all over moisture sealer if you have very dry skin.</li>
      <li>Costco sells the same box at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a weird consistency that blends right into the skin without really spreading, and you need a lot more of the product (compared to, say, L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s hand cream) to cover a hand.&lt;br</li>
      <li>We keep a tube near the television and use it in the evening when dishes are done, etc.  </li>
      <li>In fact the skins absorbs the cream seamlessly.</li>
      <li>It is thick, but spreads and absorbs easily.</li>
      <li>It is as at least as good or better than what I had been using, and is far less expensive.  </li>
      <li>Only thing I have found that really helps with dry cuticles.  </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s lasting me a long time, and it has a subtle alfalfa smell to it :)</li>

<li> It&#x27;s got a creamy texture to it but is not at all greasy or heavy.</li>
<li> a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I like how thick this hand cream is</li>
<li> My husband likes it as well, partly because any scent is very subtle.  </li>
<li> I had horrible eczema on my hands and after using this for two days it cleared up.</li>

    <li> I ordered this last year and loved it in the winter months, so I ordered more again this year.  Now my daughter is hooked on it too.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great and is not greasy, but works great to care for my dry winter skin.</li>
    <li> So in love with this cream!  Not greasy, but extremely nourishing.  I work in a commercial kitchen and do a ton of dishes with harsh chemicals.  Nothing makes my hands feel better after a long day than the Jenna Hipp lotion.  As a bonus my nails look good too!</li>
    <li> Only thing I have found that really helps with dry cuticles.  I have been looking for years. I stumble on this by accident. Will not by any other hand creme. You can say. I&#x27;m sold. Thanks Jenna Hipp</li>
    <li> After reading many enthusiastic reviews and Oprah&#x27;s recommendation, I bought this 3-pack, only to discover that this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t moisturize very well.  Yes, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;non-greasy,&amp;#34; but it also has almost no staying power, and melts into nothingness upon contact with water.  It&#x27;s got a weird consistency that blends right into the skin without really spreading, and you need a lot more of the product (compared to, say, L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s hand cream) to cover a hand.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve happily used hand creams from many companies, raging from high-end to drugstore variety.  This is the first negative review I&#x27;ve ever posted of a hand cream.</li>
    <li> I love this cream and have finished my first tube. With 20% shea butter, this cream is perfect for the dry skin in the winters. It&#x27;s got a creamy texture to it but is not at all greasy or heavy. In fact the skins absorbs the cream seamlessly. It keeps my hands smooth and moisturized but not for many hours though. I feel like i need to reapply the cream after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has NOT helped my brittle nails at all, so that claim is def. refuted. Overall a good hand cream. Costco sells the same box at a very reasonable price. I would highly recommend the cream.</li>
    <li> Best cream I have ever used on my hands - first winter ever I have ever had no splitting of the tips of my fingers, which is a true blessing.  I use it every night and often through the day.  I had to buy it when the first three my daughter gave me ran out.  And I am going to give her some and give it as gifts to others.  Arrived right on time.</li>
    <li> I had been using a much pricier hand cream from a well known department-store brand.  Then I read a review of this (I think in Real Simple), figured what the heck and found it on Amazon.  It is as at least as good or better than what I had been using, and is far less expensive.  My husband likes it as well, partly because any scent is very subtle.  We keep a tube near the television and use it in the evening when dishes are done, etc.  My hands are smoother and cuticles are as well, even though I tend to clean house and garden with bothering much with gloves.  It is thick, but spreads and absorbs easily.</li>
    <li> love this product-- it says for hands but I have dry legs so I use it on my legs! it&#x27;s worked wonders!</li>
    <li> I had seen this on my manager&#x27;s desk and said can I try this?  This lotion is amazing.  I know it is for hands and fingers mostly, but I use it on my feet tool.LOL</li>
    <li> I like how thick this hand cream is, I use it mostly for my feet because it didn&#x27;t absorb to well on my hands. But it&#x27;s lasting me a long time, and it has a subtle alfalfa smell to it :)</li>
    <li> It has a pleasant, understated herbal scent and seems to do a good job protecting my hands.  The only drawback is that it has to be renewed more often than the one I was using previously (which unfortunately had a scent that bothered one of my coworkers).</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cream for both my hands and feet. It&#x27;s not greasy and it works in well.</li>
    <li> The best hand lotion!</li>
    <li> Smells great, very lightweight . I keep on tube by my kitchen sink for after dish washing and a tube in my handbag.</li>
    <li> One of the only lotions that isn&#x27;t greasy and rubs in quick</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It&#x27;s like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used on my hands before.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended...A true bartender&#x27;s friend.&lt;br /&gt;Hands are not slippery after application and then coming into contact with water.&lt;br /&gt;Great all over moisture sealer if you have very dry skin. (think legs &amp; feet.)&lt;br /&gt;I really like having three tubes of Jenna Hipp to stash here and there.&lt;br /&gt;Will be ordering more to keep my supply up.</li>
    <li> Found an amazing price at Costco! 17.00$ I absolutely in love!Its not greasy and absorbes quickly and leaves your hands feeling soft.Long term Idk what the affects are but so far loving it</li>
    <li> Wonderful lotion. Thick smells nice and cute packaging.</li>
    <li> I like it because it absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel and it doesn&#x27;t have a scent so it won&#x27;t compete with the perfume that I wear. It&#x27;s great for the feet as well as the hands.</li>
    <li> My favorite hand cream. It is a must have in the summer for dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have used for dry skin. One thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the ingredients is not listed on the product. I had to go online to see what was in it. There are a few things I&#x27;m sure aren&#x27;t natural but honestly I don&#x27;t even care, the lotion works so well. I had horrible eczema on my hands and after using this for two days it cleared up. My nails look so much better too. It&#x27;s my new miracle cream! And I have tried so many creams! Don&#x27;t suggest for face, broke out after putting it on my chin for a dry area. Also great at work, I type all day and can apply the lotion and get back to work without a greasy film.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for stocking stuffers for Christmas and one of my sisters said it was the best product she&#x27;d ever put on her hands. Enough said.</li>
    <li> I have eczema on my hands and have tried dozens of hand creams... finally, I have found *the one*. It rubs in smoothly, with no leftover greasiness or stickiness, and has just the slightest fragrance. Absolutely perfect.</li>
    <li> Best hand cream hands down!  No greasy residue.  Great for nurses with dry hands from washing.</li>
    <li> moisturizes deeply without greasiness. Has a nice fresh scent and leaves hands feeling clean. Love that they are in a space-saving tube - great for travel.</li>
