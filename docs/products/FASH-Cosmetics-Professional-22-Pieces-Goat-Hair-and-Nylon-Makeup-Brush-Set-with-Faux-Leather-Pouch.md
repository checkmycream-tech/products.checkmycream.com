      <li>Timely delivery, excellent array of brushes.</li>
      <li>This is very cheaply made!!</li>
      <li>I bought them thinking they were going to be great</li>
      <li>I bought two sets as gifts and the quality is great.</li>
      <li>I thought this was a great brush set for the price I had to pay.</li>
      <li>cause these brushes are great quality</li>
      <li>I was gonna get when I ordered these brushes, but when I got them delivered I was so happy</li>
      <li>I love these brushes!!</li>
      <li>Purchased this as a gift and the recipient really loved it.</li>
      <li>Otherwise love it!</li>
      <li>let me just say that the brushes look way too nice in the pictures</li>
      <li>They are all semi circled on the top but the fluffier ones are good for blending.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll lose a bristle here and there, but that happens with most any brush.</li>
      <li>they are perfect for regular use</li>
      <li>Spend more a get a better product.</li>
      <li>I wasnt sure what</li>
      <li>Overall im very happy with the set!</li>
      <li>GO SPEND THE MONEY FOR A BETTER SET.</li>
      <li>Im gonna be buying from Amazon all the time now thanks, !!!!</li>
      <li>These brushes are great except for the fact that two of them so far came off the handle.</li>
      <li>Other than that this product works great for my clients!</li>
      <li>and they work fine.</li>
      <li>It is cheap and you can tell.</li>
      <li>But overall the price-quality rate is great.</li>
      <li>But I was able to hot glue</li>
      <li>and I got such a good deal on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Other than that, they&#x27;re a great price for this product</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with the softness of the brushes,they have a few brushes that aren&#x27;t really needed.</li>
      <li>and she was thrilled with all the different brushes.</li>
      <li>it is a good thing that brushes are soft but not too soft.</li>
      <li>Shortly after using, another one broke as well, plus the hairs fall out very easily.</li>
      <li>I got these as my first brush kit and mainly because you get a lot for a cheap price.</li>
      <li>Might as well actually just spend the money one time and get a great product instead of constantly buying crappy brushes.</li>
      <li>When I recieved my brushes the metal part was detatched from the handle on soke brushes, and most are crooked.</li>
      <li>However it is cheap, so if you want a professional brush set DO NOT get this.</li>
      <li>Other than that they are amazing brushes.</li>
      <li>The setup is nice, a pouch that closes and feels professional only added value to the set.</li>
      <li>If it had been one of the little brushes that there are many of it wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal but the large fan brush is nice to have.</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s true what they say cheap price cheap quality :/</li>
      <li>Those irky, hard-to-find brushes are almost certainly going to be in this set.</li>
      <li>I do my make up every day and gently.</li>
      <li>The eyeshadow brushes are really hash on my lids</li>
      <li>Its definitely made of cheap pleather.</li>
      <li>However those did not matter as much since you do get a lot of brushes to choose from.  </li>
      <li>and i got it really fast.</li>
      <li>that I see I really am getting what it says its suppose to be...</li>
      <li>i mean the brushes were a good price.</li>
      <li>I love all the other brushes.</li>
      <li>Some hairs come off when using, specially the big blush and sculpting brushes.</li>
      <li>These brushes suck waste of money they feel super cheap</li>
      <li>but I can always super glue them back.</li>
      <li>but i do not so much for professional use.</li>
      <li>I love these brushes but the biggest round one sheds.</li>
      <li>I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>These brushes were super soft when I first got them, except they were shedding a little.</li>
      <li>they are very soft but the problem is they are too soft for me, i am a makeup artist and the angle and foundation brushes didn&#x27;t work for me do to the brushes being way too soft the makeup went all over the place.</li>
      <li>The brush case smells strongly of plastic when you first open it, but leave it open for a few hours and the smell is gone.</li>
      <li>They are soft, fluffy, and rarely sheds.</li>
      <li>You have to use carefully and clean them carefully.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get frayed brushes very often and now my brush is fraying even after properly cleaning and not applying roughly.</li>
      <li>However one of the sets was missing the large fan brush.</li>
      <li>, i saw good and bad reviews.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Some hairs come off when using, specially the big blush and sculpting brushes. But overall the price-quality rate is great.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes but the biggest round one sheds. The smell of the case eventually goes away. I love all the other brushes. They are soft, fluffy, and rarely sheds. They don&#x27;t have the dome brushes. They are all semi circled on the top but the fluffier ones are good for blending. The only thing i hate is the one brush that sheds and no dome brushes. Other than that, they&#x27;re a great price for this product and i got it really fast.</li>
    <li> I bought two sets as gifts and the quality is great. However one of the sets was missing the large fan brush. I would&#x27;ve returned it if it wasn&#x27;t for a gift. I&#x27;m hoping that the seller will send a brush to replace the missing one. If it had been one of the little brushes that there are many of it wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal but the large fan brush is nice to have. I bought the set for my daughter who is a model and she was thrilled with all the different brushes.</li>
    <li> I was not very happy with this product.  I was missing 3brushes in the set. The red dye from the pouch came off and dyed some of the brushes hair to a red.  However those did not matter as much since you do get a lot of brushes to choose from.  But the brushes are not very good, before even using the brushes the hair on the brushes were falling off. Don&#x27;t buy, this is a horrible deal.  Spend more a get a better product.</li>
    <li> Bad cheap material!!!!too hard on face:(((((....wasted my money on these cheap brushes worse than the ones in the drugstore wish I could have my money back!!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with the quality of these brushes! there inexpensive so you take the chance of them tottaly being crappy,but these are so great! I&#x27;m very impressed with the softness of the brushes,they have a few brushes that aren&#x27;t really needed.Overall im very happy with the set!</li>
    <li> Timely delivery, excellent array of brushes. You&#x27;ll lose a bristle here and there, but that happens with most any brush. The brush case smells strongly of plastic when you first open it, but leave it open for a few hours and the smell is gone. I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> so i bought this set even though i read the reviews, i saw good and bad reviews. i thought id give it a try and see to myself. i mean the brushes were a good price. let me just say that the brushes look way too nice in the pictures but in reality they&#x27;re kinda ugly. they are very soft but the problem is they are too soft for me, i am a makeup artist and the angle and foundation brushes didn&#x27;t work for me do to the brushes being way too soft the makeup went all over the place. it is a good thing that brushes are soft but not too soft. they are perfect for regular use but i do not so much for professional use. i sated my opinion buy at your risk.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!! The only thing i didn&#x27;t like was the brushes came unglued to the wood. I&#x27;ve had to re-glue a few of them. Otherwise love it!</li>
    <li> I got these for my friend for christmas and she was soooooo excited!!!!!!  She goes to school for cosmotology and sad she cant wait to brag about all her diff makeup brushes now.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift and the recipient really loved it. The plus side of this purchase is the variability in brushes. Those irky, hard-to-find brushes are almost certainly going to be in this set. The setup is nice, a pouch that closes and feels professional only added value to the set. I would recommend this set.</li>
    <li> I wasnt sure what I was gonna get when I ordered these brushes, but when I got them delivered I was so happy cause these brushes are great quality and I got such a good deal on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I see I really am getting what it says its suppose to be...Im gonna be buying from Amazon all the time now thanks, !!!!</li>
    <li> When I recieved my brushes the metal part was detatched from the handle on soke brushes, and most are crooked. But I was able to hot glue the metal parts back to the handle and they work fine.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great except for the fact that two of them so far came off the handle. Not cool but I can always super glue them back. Other than that they are amazing brushes. Hope they last along time.</li>
    <li> This is very cheaply made!! It came as pictured but with a hole already on the front of it. Its definitely made of cheap pleather. The brushes are not bad, except that one of the brush heads was already broken upon arriving. Shortly after using, another one broke as well, plus the hairs fall out very easily. You have to use carefully and clean them carefully. Do not recommend washing in water. You would need to use a cleaning spray and if you do use water and soap be careful. I got these as my first brush kit and mainly because you get a lot for a cheap price. However it is cheap, so if you want a professional brush set DO NOT get this. If you want an inexpensive brush set to use, then these will do their job, but FYI do expect one or some of them to break.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a great brush set for the price I had to pay. Although it did smell weird before I washed them which Im guessing it was that goat smell but at least I know it was real goat hair. And one of the brush heads fell off but I just glued it back on. Other than that this product works great for my clients!</li>
    <li> Worst brushes ever! I bought them thinking they were going to be great but I&#x27;m very disappointed. They hairs fall off and they smell like chemicals. They are not soft like everyone says. They gave me a rash on my check. I wish I had read the reviews about this brush before I bought them. I guess it&#x27;s true what they say cheap price cheap quality :/</li>
    <li> These brushes suck waste of money they feel super cheap all of them suck they are not soft if anything it feels so bad on your face when doing makeup I do not recommend this for anyone not even for people that don&#x27;t no nothing about brushes or makeup</li>
    <li> Horrible brushes! The eyeshadow brushes are really hash on my lids it feels like my eyes are being scratched when I&#x27;m trying to blend....and they shed like crazy! I&#x27;ve washed them thinking it would stop...but No! They SHED, SHED, SHED. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these brushes. They&#x27;re not soft at all and they shed like crazy!</li>
    <li> These brushes were super soft when I first got them, except they were shedding a little. So I gave them another month. I do my make up every day and gently. I don&#x27;t get frayed brushes very often and now my brush is fraying even after properly cleaning and not applying roughly. The bristles break off when I do my make up and end up all over my face, chest and shirt. I have to brush  myself off when I&#x27;m done. SERIOUSLY: GO SPEND THE MONEY FOR A BETTER SET. I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand and it was on a huge sale when I purchased and I had the &amp;#34;it&#x27;s expensive, it must be good&amp;#34; mentality. Totally false. It is cheap and you can tell. Might as well actually just spend the money one time and get a great product instead of constantly buying crappy brushes.</li>
