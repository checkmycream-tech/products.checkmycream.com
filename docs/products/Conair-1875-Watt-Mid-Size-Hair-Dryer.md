      <li>It&#x27;s really light and awesome for travel!</li>

      <li>Arrive in condiction good.</li>

      <li>it looks beautiful, neat and clean.</li>
      <li>Works great and light to handle</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s kind of a plus.</li>
      <li>I consider myself a reasonably handy person -</li>
      <li>a hair dryer this has earned an honest 3 stars.</li>
      <li>For an artist though, having a longer cord would be handy.</li>
      <li>No problems of any kind.  </li>

      <li>Two settings and blows warm air.  </li>

      <li>I own a $200 hair dryer and like this one a lot better.</li>
      <li>Bought two for guest bathroom and so far it&#x27;s been perfect.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s golden for travel, and great for short-term usage.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this hair dryer!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very light which makes it easier on my arthritic shoulder.</li>
      <li>The GFCI plug seems very cheap.</li>
      <li>Would be nice to have an unheated option, but for the price it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>The price is very good, and I love it so far.</li>
      <li>perfect, I thought a cheap little one wouldnt be great</li>
      <li>So, this means I will not be buying any more ConAir hair dryers.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Just pay $3 more for the better model.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Powerful, well-designed and worth the money.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift and they liked it!</li>
    <li> This hairdryer barely works at all.  It blows light warm air.  Not good at all.</li>
    <li> This is a great little dryer. I bought it after using one in a hotel and wanting one for myself. It is very basic but does the job without destroying my eardrums. A minor complaint is that the cord is bit on the short side, but I cope with it.</li>
    <li> This dryer is a great device and works well. It&#x27;s small and can easily be transported while travelling. It&#x27;s also powerful and helps to dry hair out.</li>
    <li> I wanted a faster, more powerful dryer and this one is it.  It&#x27;s just like the hairstylists use.  I love it</li>
    <li> Sadly the product broke the first month of use.  I would not recommend purchasing.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my rental and haven&#x27;t tested it out myself but it&#x27;s perfect for that.  Not sure about everyday use.</li>
    <li> This is a really good hair dryer. Most other models either have low airflow or are very loud and hurt my ears. This one is hot, has high airflow and the sound is soft and easy on my sensitive ears.</li>
    <li> I only bought this to winterized windows.  Two settings and blows warm air.  Ummm not sure what else u need.</li>
    <li> Nice little hair dryer. Great for basics which is all I need! Works well.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer broke after a couple of months - it would switch from high to low and no heat on its own. . . ..</li>
    <li> This is small enough to take on the road and is also small enough to keep at home.  The power is very good.</li>
    <li> It does not get hot, but that&#x27;s better of hair anyway.</li>
    <li> Works great and light to handle</li>
    <li> It seems to work fine, but I&#x27;ve only used it a few times. I&#x27;m a guy, with short hair so I never have a need to use it on myself. I use it to dry my dogs after they get baths, and it does the job... and it was very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Cheap and useful!!!!! I love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> There is no blue button toward the top of the handle.  No \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button.  Works fine but only high and low settings, both heated.  If you don&#x27;t care about having a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; air button then it is fine.</li>
    <li> This a wonderful little dryer at a remarkably low price. It is quiet and efficient. This is a very  good BUY!!!! Recommended.</li>
    <li> I had been looking to purchase a blow dryer for our spare bathroom and trailer when I found this one I was so happy it has exceded all my expectations. It was such a good deal. I am very pleaswed with the product and how fast it arrived.</li>
    <li> good basic hair dryer - no frills and great price, Using on very short hair that is blown quickly and done.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer isn&#x27;t very powerful but it suits my needs and has a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; setting, but for the record the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; setting is referred to as &amp;#34;low.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> fast delivery great little travel item for me and use it to seal windows plastic liners in winter. Price is excellent.</li>
    <li> Well, it was under ten bucks shipped.  Beats anything for that price from Wally World.  And it works.  High speed with high heat and low speed with a lower heat.  No frills and no high speed / cold air option if you need that for anything.  Small and compact too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> After beginning a minimum-heat regiment for my hair, I was looking for something cheap and quick to dry my hair after my weekly wash. This is the perfect basic dryer; it has two heat settings and gets the job done quickly and effectively. It&#x27;s also pretty quiet and not too big.</li>
    <li> This dryer does NOT have the cool shot setting. Normally, there is a bright blue button on the handle. My old dryer had the button but my new, replacement unit, received this week, is missing that option even though the Amazon description says otherwise. Disappointing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking at some of my previous reviews and noticed the picture has finally been changed to reflect the hair dryer model without the blue cool-shot button on the handle.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer does exactly what it&#x27;s meant for. Good quality product overall. The only thing I&#x27;m a little unhappy with is the switch which seems a tad \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; to me. Slides a little loose in the 3 positions, but it works fine. I would recommend this to someone. Price is right and it&#x27;s perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my spare bathroom to have for guests.  It&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> Cons: Low speed is too low, high speed is too high.  It doesn&#x27;t blow hot air for the first 5 minutes.  Speed button is hard to control quickly, I always go past the \\&quot;off\\&quot; when I want it to switch off.  It reminds me of cheap hotel blow dryers.  The back doesn&#x27;t have a filter, so my hair gets stuck in it if I turn wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It was cheap.  It&#x27;s lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just pay $3 more for the better model.</li>
    <li> This is the first blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s simple and pretty effective. I gave it 4/5 stars because I was a little confused with how to make it work. Great for the price. It has only two settings, low and high. I&#x27;ve used the low setting only. I wish it had had a better explanation for how to make it start working. Otherwise, it&#x27;s great, no complaints.</li>
    <li> My small &#x27;emergency&#x27; hair dryer exploded, so I bought this one. It works very well; I have no major complaints.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Small hair dryer, perfect to put on you travel bag and use anywhere. Works perfectly. I recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> The price is very good, and I love it so far. The color is clean and pure. Both speed work well.</li>
    <li> a basic hair dryer for the cost. it works good for the thing it is supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;simple and neat.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this hair dryer after using it during a recent hotel stay.  I was drawn to the fact that it does not emanate the same high-pitched tone that my prior Conair makes (which is also an 1875 but has added features such as cool air and turbo settings).  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  The hair dryer is VERY lightweight, cheap, and hot enough to get the job done.  Most importantly to me, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m damaging my hearing when I use it.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It&#x27;s light weight and fairly easy to handle. I would have given it 5 stars except that the cord tangles a bit while using it. Maybe it will loosen up after a while I don&#x27;t know, but right now it&#x27;s kind of annoying. Also it doesn&#x27;t have a cool air button, which it didn&#x27;t claim to have one so it&#x27;s not their fault, but I didn&#x27;t think of it checking when I read the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money it&#x27;s a great item. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a simple hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Works as expected fast delivery</li>
    <li> Like so many others I will inform fellow shoppers that there is no cool-shot on this hair dryer. The product description also says there are \\&quot;2 heat and speed settings\\&quot; when it should more accurately say \\&quot;2 heat/speed\\&quot; settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a hair dryer this has earned an honest 3 stars. There is nothing wrong with the product as it has plenty of power and gets hot. It is simple however, and I can&#x27;t bring myself to rate it any more stars than 3 since it does not have any of the features of the higher-end models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as Amazon&#x27;s listing is concerned I would rate it 1 star. If I were looking for multiple heat settings and a cool-shot option I would have been very upset when I received this product. but I wasn&#x27;t, and I&#x27;m not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re considering this  product just look at the picture. That is exactly what you are getting. The controls are \\&quot;High, Off, Low\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> You may not think this hair dryer by Conair is powerful, just by the small size that it is, but this Conair dryer is really useful, and it&#x27;s great for traveling. It takes about 10 minutes to dry my hair ( on high ) with this hair dryer, but I&#x27;ve really long, and thick hair. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this hair dryer is that you&#x27;ve to hold down the cool button, it can get annoying after awhile. I do like the cool button, because when it&#x27;s hot out you don&#x27;t want to have heat blowing on you, because it will just make you hotter. Overall this hair dryer is worth the $10 I paid for it. You will get great use out of this hair dryer overtime. Conair is one of the best haircare product brands. I recommend this hair dryer by Conair.</li>
    <li> Cheap and enough for normal use.</li>
    <li> Great little hair dryer. Powerful with good heat.It&#x27;s also very light which makes it easier on my arthritic shoulder. Price was also great.</li>
    <li> In the sense that it lacks a bunch of settings, I probably should have given it a 4. But I knew when I purchased it it wouldn&#x27;t have those settings. It blows great, has a long enough cord for me and definitely a great price.</li>
    <li> My old faithful Conair finally died and this dryer was the replacement...and a dandy one it has turned out to be.  It dries very quickly compared to my older model and it is lighter weight and easier to handle.  No problems of any kind.  Good purchase.</li>
    <li> had it about 5 months.  very happy with it.  light enought for 3/4th graders to use on longer hair</li>
    <li> Super great hair dryer for very little cost.  I own a $200 hair dryer and like this one a lot better.</li>
    <li> perfect, I thought a cheap little one wouldnt be great but it is, dries my hair great and gives me some volume.</li>
    <li> works well and pack perfect</li>
    <li> Very nice little blow dryer. I have short hair and it dries my hair in minutes. Both speeds work great and it is light weight.  Only draw back the cord is a little too short. Other than that it is perfect</li>
    <li> This is a nice basic hair dryer and very affordable.  No frills, no thrills, doesn&#x27;t fold, no retractable cord, etc.  Works very well and nothing has broken so far.  Far better than the more expensive model.  So far, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found this hair dryer. I was initially looking for one that had the folding handle, but was not successful at the time. This one is smaller than the big bulky types and does the same job, just as good. It&#x27;s easier to store being more compact and to keep out of the way, even to pack for travel.  I&#x27;ve had it for a year and still like it and it works as good as the day I got it. It&#x27;s not quiet, but it&#x27;s not overly noisy either - just sounds like a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer does exactly what it&#x27;s intended to do. However, the product description is inaccurate. The so-called \\&quot;cool shot button\\&quot; does not exist on this product. One thing which I noticed though is that the product image was updated with the blue \\&quot;cool shot button\\&quot; removed in the new image.</li>
    <li> This dryer is good for travel as it is lightweight and medium small size.  Dries  hair quickly within 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> Just a small average hair dryer. So far it&#x27;s worked every time! Wow!&lt;br /&gt; Actually it works nicely to dry my razor and occasionally my hair (yes, I&#x27;m a guy).</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter after she used the same one in our suite in Las Vegas and LOVED it for drying her ultra long locks.  A week after receiving it she cut her hair.</li>
    <li> powerful and simple works just fine for me.</li>
    <li> Terrible blowdryer. Scary to use as it sparks.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer!  I have short hair and can dry my hair in about 90 seconds.  It also is small enough to not take up too much room on the bathroom counter, and is light and fits well in my hand.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t last long and died quickly, size was nice but the motor probably wasn&#x27;t strong enough no more to say</li>
    <li> This hair drier has a powerful torrent of air for a medium sized hair drier. And the heat is plenty strong without being hot as a volcano. Plus it has a low power setting. I think it is the perfect hair drier.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hairdryer at the beginning of March. In the intervening time I have been away from home (without the hairdryer) for 6 weeks.  I have very short hair and so I don&#x27;t use it regularly and in fact with my short summer cut I hadn&#x27;t used it in 3 months.  In addition it had never been dropped or banged around.  When I went to use it yesterday I found that the red reset button on the plug had popped and would not reset, rendering the hairdryer inoperable. Since I never use it in the bathroom (which anyway has gfi outlets) I just replaced the plug with a regular non-protected one.  If the company is going to &amp;#34;protect us against ourselves&amp;#34; and potential lawsuits by persons misusing their product the least they could do is not put such a flimsy circuit breaker on their product.</li>
    <li> Bought for my son and he loves it and uses it every day.  Not too loud which is great.</li>
    <li> When my faithful Conair Infiniti Cord-Keeper Professional Tourmaline Ionic Styler 223 died on me, I picked one of these up at the local drugstore to tide me over until Amazon shipped my replacement.  It&#x27;s a very basic, cheap dryer, with two heat settings, no ionizing feature, no retractable cord, etc.  The first couple times I used it I was pleasantly surprised.  Even with no frills, it dried fast and my hair looked good.  I started wondering if I shouldn&#x27;t have bothered reordering the more expensive dryer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, halfway into the third use, this dryer sucked up some loose hairs through the back of the unit, and knotted them up around the gears.  This has never happened to me in all my years of using a hair dryer.  The motor ground down to 1/3 power, the stench of burning hair filled my bathroom, and the inside of the unit started glowing red.  I unplugged the dryer and let it cool.  The dryer was useless with the hair caught inside, and there was no way to remove the hair except to take the dryer apart.  I did so carefully and surgically removed the knot of hair with tweezers.  But when it came time to reassemble the dryer, I couldn&#x27;t make the cheap plastic pieces fit back together to save my life.  I consider myself a reasonably handy person - I assembled half the furniture in my house and replace certain car parts on my own, for instance - but this was just not happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really too bad, because the dryer does function well when it&#x27;s working properly.  Unfortunately, it quickly ended up being a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Pretty quiet and very powerful! I have very thick, dense hair and this hair dryer completely dries my hair in 10min, if that! It&#x27;s really light and awesome for travel!</li>
    <li> great hair dryer at  great price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this hairdryer for the simple task of quickly drying my short hair. I did not use it for styling or anything complicated, just simply for drying. At first it worked fine. Five months later, the hot setting clicks off one minute into running the hairdryer, and when that happens, there is a flash of light inside the dryer. The cold setting is not warm enough to dry my hair, so essentially, it is now useless. I should probably need to stop using it anyways, because the flash indicates the there is something wrong with the wiring and it is not safe to use anymore. I went back to return it, but it is too late. Mind you, the one they sent me could have been just a fluke, but for me, it ended up being a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and quite durable. Quite noisy though.</li>
    <li> it arrived on time and was what I expected.  It is not a fancy hair dryer with multiple options, but is light (I have a sore right shoulder) and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a very compact size that burned out. I mistakenly thought the larger size would mean this new one would be more powerful, but it was not. It does seem to work fine though and I probably shouldn&#x27;t deduct a star for my misgivings, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
    <li> This blow drier does work to dry my hair (it&#x27;s not the fastest but it does work well). My only complaint is that sometimes my hair gets stuck in the back part and I have to pull it out - there is no way to remove your hair safely after it has been sucked in the back. I wish this blow drier had a safety to avoid this. On the positive side, it is a good looking drier and it&#x27;s not very loud so it won&#x27;t wake my baby up in the morning.</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer.  I love it !!!!! It has power and the low setting is perfect for me.  My hair is short but think.  This dryer does the job and I am very pleased with it</li>
    <li> The main reason I wanted this dryer is because it blows \\&quot;cold\\&quot; air as well as hot.  I had a Conair dryer that did that for years. The main thing wrong with this new Conair dryer is if you have it on full speed and switch to cool air  - - the power is reduced! When it&#x27;s hot I start to sweat while using the hot heat so by switching to cool air I can continue to dry the hair without sweating.  But when the power is reduced you don&#x27;t get the same force of air.  I don&#x27;t know why they did that and it wasn&#x27;t in the product description so there&#x27;s no way I would have known. I kept it because it was the only one I could find that blows cool air.</li>
    <li> Works fine, I just wish there was a cool setting for those hot days you have to blow dry your hair. It also seems like it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my other hair dryer this size.</li>
    <li> OK hair dryer.  I like the non-skid rubber thingies on the sides of the dryer so it doesn&#x27;t slip off bathroom shelf.  The overall drying could be improved.  My Vidal Sassoon travel dryer of the same wattage dried my hair much faster.  I&#x27;m going to buy another one of those again and just keep this one as a backup dryer in our guest bath.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this for hair.  I use it for small projects, crafting projects that is.  I find that it is big enough to get a lot of stuff done (using it as a drying medium or heat-gun) but small enough that it isn&#x27;t clunky (or so that it gets in the way).  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for heavy duty all-time use.  So I would say that if you&#x27;re using it like me, great.  If you&#x27;re using it as a hair dryer on travel, etc. then great.  Otherwise I don&#x27;t know how long it would last.</li>
    <li> While this is bigger than the very small dryer it replaced, it is a light weight at the other, drys hair in minutes, and overall is exactly what I wanted.  I read most of the reviews of this dryer and others before ordering.  I know Conair products are good and a good value.  I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase in every way.</li>
    <li> I have hair down to my waistline and this thing dries my THICK hair faster than any other expensive dryer~!  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Excellent little hair dryer.  Took a good bit of time getting here though because...?  I haven&#x27;t any idea why.  I was looking for something to dry my hair without burning it and this dryer does that even on the low setting.  My hair is long, thick and I don&#x27;t care for dryers but in cold weather I&#x27;m not going out with wet or damp hair.  On the lower setting I can use a special brush I have to add curl to my hair without having to use the iron and this is really a great time saver.  On High, I will sometimes use the old fashioned curlers (no heat, just wrap hair around it and apply a clip), and this works very well. I hold the dryer far away to avoid burning my hair and within 15-20 minutes my hair is dry. Leave the curlers in until my hair is cooled and then take them out. Before I head out I just run my fingers through my hair and it looks ok. Windblown look and no hairspray! good for the hair and the enviroment.  I coouldn&#x27;t beat the price either!!!</li>
    <li> Works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s really nothing quite like the convenience of going from wet to dry hair in ten minutes or less.</li>
    <li> Best cheap hair dryer ever</li>
    <li> Bought this Hair dryer for my GF and she used it twice and the heating element seemed to stop working and only cold air came out..20 seconds later it started heating again and then 10 seconds after that started shooting out sparks like a flame thrower...called conair and they wanted us to send it to AZ and pay the postage as well as include a check for $5 for return shipping and handling&lt;br /&gt;I just throw it away</li>
    <li> Works great! My wife picked this one out and uses it and is very happy with it. Inexpensive but sturdy and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair &amp; this works great for me! It&#x27;s handy that it&#x27;s not huge and bulky too.</li>
    <li> It is a simple hair dryer and very easy to use. I am really glad. Plus, the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as described. It arrived promptly and was well packaged</li>
    <li> Works well without any issues.</li>
    <li> I did not expect a big (at least a mid) hair dryer. It looks so mini in the pic. But actually it is normal size. Very functional! I bought it as an add-on item so it is very worthy.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Finally my hair is like at the hairdresser hahaha</li>
    <li> I chose a less expensive dryer because I have no need for a powerful one.  It serves my needs well with just the basic functions.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price</li>
    <li> It works. Has only two controls, with the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; switch located between them. I don&#x27;t find this very appealing, but I do find it doesn&#x27;t take very long to dry my hair with this machine. My hair is thick, straight, and shoulder-length.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is fine and works as expected, but many of the reviews mention a cool button.  There is no cool button on this model and there is no cool button mentioned in the product specs - don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did if you want a cool button!</li>
    <li> I am not expressed with the hair dryer.  very low heat.  takes a while to warm up to produce heat.</li>
    <li> This little dryer doesn&#x27;t have all the extra features that some dryers have but it was not expensive either. It does the job and I like it.</li>
    <li> Always like Conair brand but this one is very annoying because it powers itself down to the lower speed for a few seconds every minute or so as you are using it.  It does this for about 15 seconds and then goes back to high.  This may be a defect because as I said I have never had a Conair that did this but wow it is sure frustrating.</li>
    <li> Product description is wrong. There is no &amp;#34;cool shot button&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have only used this dryer once, but it works very well.  My hair is fine so it doesn&#x27;t take long to dry so this dryer does the job quickly.  All in all, I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I wanted a basic hair dryer just to dry my hair, and maybe speed up drying clothes. This unit works well, blows hot air, and is small enough for my arthritic hands.  I am glad I bought it. If you want all the bells and whistles, this isnt the one you want. NOTE: My hubby had a hair dryer from the 70&#x27;s that was made by the same company. It just finally stopped working in 2012. I dont expect the same thing from anything made now, but maybe we will get lucky.</li>
    <li> The only reason why I give it 4 stars is that the handle is not foldable. But for this price who cares? It functions well as a machine that blows hot air out.</li>
    <li> Fast blow drying,travel size, lightweight and great price. What more could I need? I am a  professional hair stylist, but I use this for personal drying. Works or me!</li>
    <li> For how inexpensive this hair dryer was, I was a little worried about the  quality, but  this is a great hair dryer!  It is quality made, and actually the best hair dryer I have ever had! It dries the hair quickly without getting too hot, or too cold...It is Just right!</li>
    <li> Item arrived timely and as described.</li>
    <li> Great little dryer, blows strong and price is just right. Biggest down side as others have mentioned is when you press the cool button power goes down quite a bit. So unfortunately there is no way to blow a lot of cool air.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that there is not a hot/cool option, so it can get pretty hot, especially on the high setting.  Other than that, it&#x27;s an inexpensive, quality hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an artist and I needed this to help dry my artwork. It works great for that! There&#x27;s a low setting that I use if I have &amp;#34;puddles&amp;#34; in my watercolors, and a high setting if the painting is just soggy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t use it as a hairdryer, so I couldn&#x27;t tell you how well that works, haha. But it&#x27;s super reliable, compact and I have literally never had any problems with it. Maybe the cord could be longer in future designs- I don&#x27;t think most people will take issue with that though, because typically there is a plugin right next to bathroom sinks in every house. For an artist though, having a longer cord would be handy. That said, I am totally happy with it the way that it is.</li>
    <li> This is the hair dryer provided by my hotel and I was pleasantly surprised by how light weight it was and the ergonomic design made it completely comfortable to use. I use a tourmaline $200 dryer at home, it&#x27;s too bulky to travel with. I promptly  checked Amazon and found the hotel model for less than $15! It is powerful and extremely light weight and quickly dries my unruly, long thick hair. I got great results, even without a concentrator. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great guest room gift</li>
    <li> Too Loud!!!!!!! Like an airplane taking off!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s small. White is nice.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful, your hair may be wind into it.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s better to have more protection design for this product</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs, good price</li>
    <li> This thing has so much power, it will nearly blow the hair right off your head!!!  :)</li>
    <li> I actually use this in the garage for drying glues, paints and finishes, replaced a unit I had for years, works great</li>
    <li> Bought two for guest bathroom and so far it&#x27;s been perfect. Lots of power in a little size</li>
    <li> Such a great little hair dryer. Easy to store since it&#x27;s so small and amazing power for the price!</li>
    <li> I purchased it to seal and winterize my windows!&lt;br /&gt;Nice small package is great for portability as well.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Not a bad little hair dryer but don&#x27;t expect the cool shot button as pictured and described. It was not on either of the units I ordered so one went back.</li>
    <li> it looks beautiful, neat and clean. Besides, it also works very well. Very good choice! And..... it is really not expensive</li>
    <li> You know this WILL actually dry your hair pretty quickly. CONSIDERING IT RIPS IT OUT WHEN IT GETS STUCK IN THE BACK OF IT! Who designed this thing-Marques De Sade- seriously I wasn&#x27;t even trying to dry my hair - I was using for shrinkwrapping the windows , when BAM! the damn thing sucks in my hair in a whirlwind of pain. That&#x27;s when it is actually working , I know that its normal for it to go between hi and low power, but after less than 20 seconds its like&amp;#34; can I take a break now?, Drying and ripping hair out is HARD!&amp;#34; - it sucks- literally - maybe buy it for someone you secretly hate and would like to see bald.</li>
    <li> The product info here is incorrect. There is NO cool shot button on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product info here is incorrect. There is NO cool shot button on this thing.</li>
    <li> The description clearly says there is a cool shot feature, but there is not.  The product works fine as a cheap hair dryer, but the description is inaccurate.</li>
    <li> I use it every other day to dry my hair because I always wash hair at night. It is very useful to me. It has good quality and strong wind. And it looks pretty.</li>
    <li> What a waste of time!  Dryer burnt out within a week!  Cheap p.o.c.</li>
    <li> A gift for my daughter..she is always pleased with Conair..Buy their product most of the time. worth the price for sure.</li>
    <li> The description states there is a cool shot button, but there is NO COOL SHOT BUTTON! Amazon, PLEASE correct this misleading description. I wanted a small, no-heat air blower for medical purposes. This dryer seemed to be the closest thing. I&#x27;m returning it, but what a waste of time!</li>
    <li> Arrived when expected and working&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This feed back im providing is good ,. the package arrived when expected and in good shape</li>
    <li> Came when expect and what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> There should be a warning on this hairdryer!&lt;br /&gt;I was unsure of this hairdryer when I first purchased it because it didn&#x27;t perform nearly as well as my old one. For the limited times I would use it, (maybe only maybe once a week) I decided to keep it. After owning it about 4 months, while I was using it it began to dip on and off and then sparks flew out of the coil. Thankfully I was able to turn it off, what scared me more is that at no time did the dryer shut itself off as I assumed it would due to the safety plug. After reading many like complaints online I am shocked that this has not been taken off of the shelves!  For shame!</li>
    <li> I really like this dryer and am enjoying using it.  My other one had bit the dust after about 7 years.</li>
    <li> Had to replace my many-years-old Conair which finally died.  This one is the current equivalent which does exactly what the old one did.  Hope it lasts as long.</li>
    <li> This is the best dryer I have ever had. It was shiped fast for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I would have liked a &#x27;cool&#x27; button like my last one had and a tip that concentrated the air coming out of it. But it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> This Conair was everything I needed in a basic hair dryer. Inexpensive &amp; Functional. I have not tried using it for styling, but I recommend it to anyone who just needs to dry their hair plain and simple.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for 10 months.  The cord has stopped retracting.  The handle is so sticky that it is offensive.  I do not use hair products so it is not a buildup of those.  I found on line there was a recall on this product.  I called the number listed and talked with a man who was very terse and uncooperative.  He kept saying I had to have the serial number.  I read to him everything on the dryer and the serial number was not listed.  He said he couldn&#x27;t help me.  So, this means I will not be buying any more ConAir hair dryers.</li>
    <li> 2nd one I&#x27;ve owned and works like a charm!</li>
    <li> The description for this product is incorrect.  It does not contain a cool shot button.</li>
    <li> After 6 month of use in an airbnb, this dryer has proven to be a best value (5/15)</li>
    <li> i got what i paid for. nothing good and nothing bad. its basic. will buy it for someone with this hair.</li>
    <li> As described, arrived in timely manner.  Works as described.  Simple, basic, and quality product.  This is a good seller and I would recommend this product, it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love the size of this dryer.  Only used it a few times so far but I think it will do a fine job.</li>
    <li> This is a godd little hair blower--no ions--which I don&#x27;t want since I need bulk, not flat.  I gave one to a friend who doesn&#x27;t have too much money and she loves it too.  I&#x27;m leaving them at my nieces&#x27; (three) homes so I have a reliable, good hair blower whenever I visit them.</li>
    <li> This performs as expected, Small enough for travel. Always been a fan of this brand. one two three four five.</li>
    <li> Product excelent. Arrive in condiction good. Thanks</li>
    <li> I needed a quick replacement for my spare dryer and wasn&#x27;t interested in spending much money.  This one has two settings, a nice grip, and a little loop for hanging it.  It does not have a \\&quot;no heat\\&quot; setting like the one it replaced, and is pretty noisy.  Ours has also, after just a couple of months of daily use, developed a bit of a rattle when used at certain angles, which to me indicates that it might have something loose or just out of tolerance and that the dryer may not hold up long term.  While this met my needs, I&#x27;ll likely be replacing it with a more expensive, slightly fancier model.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hairdryer thinking I would rarely use it. It&#x27;s now my favorite one to use! It&#x27;s very powerful for the price and compact enought to take with me everywhere. Thanks Amazon! You always have great products!!</li>
    <li> Not too big and not too small! Does it&#x27;s job well!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer did not last even two months.  My hair would get caught in the back of the dryer.  Never had this problem with other hair dryers.  It is already useless and I had to replace it with another hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Great price, great blow dryer! I travel a lot and always need a small but powerful one. I end up leaving mine behind when I go to places such as Cuba where they can&#x27;t get any, and I simply replace it when I get home.</li>
    <li> I admit I ordered this because it was fairly cheap. Also, it resembled another one I had used and been happy with. It only has two speeds, really high, and too low to do any good. I use the really high setting first, to blow out most of the water, and then I try to style using the lower setting. I have had varying levels of success, but that may be more due to my lack of skill with a hair dryer. Anyway, if you want to dry your hair quickly, it works great. If you are serious about using a blow dryer to style your hair, you might want to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small yet powerful. Very happy with this purchase as I have thick, long hair.</li>
    <li> Sending it back.  Blows too hard on high....needs another speed besides low.</li>
    <li> good quality, but it was just a little bit too loud</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer to keep at my boyfriend&#x27;s. It only has two settings: high and low, and you can&#x27;t change the heat setting on it. It has no bells and whistles etc etc, it&#x27;s just a simple little hair dryer that does what it&#x27;s supposed to. In a way, I like it better than the expensive hair dryer I keep at my house. The temperature of it is just right and the high setting is powerful enough to dry my hair in a few minutes flat, while the low setting is good for styling.</li>
    <li> Straight forward, strong hot heat. I&#x27;m a guy and this thing is the simple hot strong wind I wanted. Simple High and Low setting. That&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> The dryer is a good one, although it is a little big and not so cute. It is quite cheap.</li>
    <li> Great thing for the price! Small and handy and light. Dries pretty quickly and has safety designs so that&#x27;s kind of a plus.</li>
    <li> Nice product and a great price</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is the best !!  I have very long hair and it dries my hair in minuets.  It used to take me 20 minuets to dry my hair.  Now with this great dryer it only takes me minuets.  This saved a lot of time in the morning.  I can dry my bangs in seconds. They come out perfect every time.</li>
    <li> Small but powerful.arms dont hurt from holding</li>
    <li> This item arrived and works as described.  Small enough to not take up a ton of room if your prep area, but puts out enough heat to get the job done.</li>
    <li> I love the compact nature of this hair dryer.  And I like that it has only two settings, high and low.  Because it&#x27;s so small, however, I can imagine that if a person with long hair used this to dry at the roots, the ends of the hair could easily get sucked into the air intake part at the back of the dryer.  I have shoulder-length hair, so it&#x27;s not a problem but it seems like that could be a problem.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that occasionally the high setting blows at a low speed.  I turn it off and turn it back on to high and it works fine.</li>
    <li> It is a nice hair dryer. But unfortunately not the model my wife wanted. Has good power and I would recommend it</li>
    <li> Good value, great price!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer has been used by me for well over 3 months and I love it. It&#x27;s kept me from getting sick right after I get out the shower to use it to dry my hair.</li>
    <li> Simple, cheap and easy to use just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Needed an extra one for the motorhome.  Like</li>
    <li> good quality and lasts a long time...</li>
    <li> I bought this unit about 2 months ago. I am retired so I do not use it every day. I have short hair so it has not seen hard duty. Today it began to run erratically. It also gave off a burning smell. My husband checked it out and found the fan motor is giving off heavy blue arcing. This is a piece of garbage and should be removed from the market place. I am dismayed that a name such as CONAIR would sell such junk.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and blows with the force of a hurricane!</li>
    <li> Good but does not have a cool button</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is fast, and compact. It has a high and low setting, and gets the job done effectively because it has such a strong blow. The only problem I had with it, is that the back end of it kept sucking in my hair, and it resulted in it giving off the smell of burning hair, and accompanied by it no longer working as well as it could, after 3 weeks of having it. The only reason why I gave it a 4 and not a three is because you and me both have the responsibility of keeping our hair away from the back end of the hair dryer. The reason why it does not have a 5 is because, although it is very strong, could not handle a few pieces of hair getting into the fan part, which is understandable, but still an engineering flaw. It&#x27;s golden for travel, and great for short-term usage.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this hair dryer!  I&#x27;ve been looking (and trying) for months now! I finally found the perfect one for me!  YEAH! It&#x27;s lightweight, small enough to travel and powerful. So easy to use. Economical, too!  I&#x27;m going to buy another one for the guest bath!  It&#x27;s hard to locate great hair dryers when you find one that you like in a hotel. For some reason Conair puts &amp;#34;1875&amp;#34; on most ALL their dryers, so it&#x27;s hard to tell the actual model number when you find one that you like...  Glad we were finally able to track this one down!</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer in September of 2012. It is now April 2013 and the dryer is on its last legs. It still runs, but it \\&quot;powers down\\&quot; to a lower setting while trying to use the high setting. I expect it to quit all together soon.</li>
    <li> Lots of power, nice compact size which is why I ordered it. Great for travel</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use my hair dryer for much more than drying purposes... Lol... It&#x27;s simple, in-expensive, and it blows a lot of hot air... ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It serves its purpose well...</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the cheap price draw you in. This hair dryer is not worth it. I tossed my still working hair dryer that I had owned for 8 years when I bought this. 6 months later it caught on fire. Yes caught on fire on the inside was a bright blue flame and a burning smell. Frightening! Do not buy!</li>
    <li> Great little investment! It&#x27;s not amazing, but for the price it does very well and has lasted me several months so far. I decided to go with this little guy because the &#x27;professional&#x27; supplies that I pay top dollar for break after a couple uses. So it is definitely a pleasant surprise for me that I am getting the mileage out of this hair dryer that I am.</li>
    <li> The cord is too short and  and the dryer does not have a cool setting. Plus the high/low printing  came off after a few uses.</li>
    <li> I really loved this hair dryer for a long time; it worked just fine, and was a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one day my mother-in-law got her hair caught in it (how does one do that, anyway?) and now it only seems to work at half power, and can get really hot really easily.  I suppose it would only be an expensive hair dryer (if any) which could take preventative measures in their system to more effectively deal with that sort of thing if it were to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so I&#x27;m satisfied with it and might buy a new one for myself, and pass off the old one to my mother-in-law.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer and it arrived quickly, the item was exactly what I order. I am pleased with this!</li>
    <li> Keeps on working, but high speed almost blows your head off and very loud.</li>
    <li> Only has two settings (other than off) - High Fan &amp; Hot and Low Fan &amp; Warm. Would be nice to have an unheated option, but for the price it&#x27;s fine. The GFCI plug seems very cheap.</li>
    <li> works great  but there is too much noise, i bought it for my girl friend and she loves it very much.</li>
    <li> exactly what i ordered, quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;It looks cheap and small, but it is very powerful, works perfectly fine.</li>
    <li> I loved this hair dryer as it qulickly starts and dry hair within few minutes no hold on time and ready to go for party or amy other function</li>
    <li> My wife loves this hair dryer.  Our daughter was given one as a gift and she wanted one too.  Several settings and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is a nice little unit but only time will tell how it holds up.  While Conair calls it an 1875 watt hairdryer, my Kill A Watt meter measured 1200 watts.  I suspect that the other manufacturers claims are just as misleading.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see them adding a shunt resistor to increase the power drain so that the unit would appear to be even more powerful.  But, if they did, sooner or later the truth would be uncovered.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer!  It dries in no time flat!</li>
