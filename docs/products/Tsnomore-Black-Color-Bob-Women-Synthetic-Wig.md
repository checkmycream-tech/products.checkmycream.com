      <li>Great quality!</li>
      <li>The price was perfect for me!  </li>
      <li>Perfect for Terezi, Nepeta, and Kanaya from Homestuck!</li>
      <li>Awesome wig.</li>
      <li>Beautiful wig very happy with it</li>
      <li>Quality was very good (could not see through to the scalp as with some others).  </li>
      <li>the style of the wig was perfect and its great for a terezi wig</li>
      <li>think we both agree that waiting for it to come in from China wasn&#x27;t as ideal, but it did come in during the period they told us it would come in by.</li>
      <li>It arrived a good 10 days before it said it would, and fits well!</li>
      <li>She absolutely loved it - it was the perfect style for her character.  </li>
      <li>For the price, its a good wig  but not the ideal length that is shows.</li>
      <li>I bought it for my Terezi cosplay but it would be great for nepeta, or if trimmed kanaya.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great wig, yet quite shorter than the image depicted.</li>
      <li>Great deal.  </li>
      <li>The wig is very nice.</li>
      <li>it is a very nice item, and the quality is good.</li>
      <li>this one is in very good condition and I like it a lot :)</li>
      <li>Good quality and fit perfectly for Terezi.</li>
      <li>MY DAUGHTER LOVED IT.</li>
      <li>She thinks it is of good quality.</li>
      <li>Came in good time and no damage during shipping.</li>
      <li>Good wig for the price.</li>
      <li>The wig is light weight and fits my head perfectly</li>
      <li>However, great purchase, fast delivery and excellent value.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful texture, almost like human hair, and has wonderful feathery styling.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect and feels like real hair!!</li>
      <li>This was my first cosplay wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and I have to say I&#x27;m really happy with the result!</li>
      <li>:) THANK YOU!</li>
      <li>VERY AWESOME WIG, LOOKS LIKE REAL HAIR!</li>
      <li>This is a wig of many uses!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy for styling and all around a great wig</li>
      <li>All in all, it is an amazing wig an</li>
      <li>but it was amazing.</li>
      <li>My friend even stole it for a while to use for her Terezi and Kanaya cosplays before she got her own.</li>
      <li>The quality seems pretty good and if you need a shortish wig then it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and nicely styled, good for the price.</li>
      <li>This wig fits great, it&#x27;s color is great, but it&#x27;s extremely short.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very comfortable to wear, with almost no itching.</li>
      <li>I still like it and wear it, but if you want a sleek look at the top, this is not the wig to get.</li>
      <li>It sticks up on top, like someone took sections to add volume to it.</li>
      <li>I love everything about it</li>
      <li>but I love it.</li>
      <li>Otherwise I love it</li>
      <li>WILL BE BUYING FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN!:)</li>
      <li>When I got it, I could adjust it to look more like Terezi, but some might confuse it for a Kanaya wig.</li>
      <li>and I love how to fits.</li>
      <li>I found this one and figured it was better than nothing (no offense yazilind).</li>
      <li>However she thinks it is a pretty good wig.</li>
      <li>This wig is amazing, it&#x27;s very full, it rarely ever sheds, and it stays like that.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really soft and looks great and didn&#x27;t need any styling out of the bag.</li>
      <li>There were lots of stray flyaway hairs, but those could be easily taimed with water or hairspray.</li>
      <li>The shipping was easy, and when I pulled it out of the bag I was amazed by the fullness and thickness of it.</li>
      <li>Lover it easy to style</li>
      <li>The wig looks fine for the costume I am going to use it for</li>
      <li>Super cute and comfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>Got my wig today and it looks fantastic.</li>
      <li>This wig was super soft, as close to realistic as a synthetic wig can get, and styled perfectly for the cosplay I bought it for (Lady from DMC).</li>
      <li>It works great with my cosplay especially terezi.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my kid to wear to Anime Con, but it&#x27;s such a nice wig she can wear it anywhere!</li>
      <li>They were even nice enough to include some free gifts with my order!</li>
      <li>but overall it is good quality for the price.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an extremely short wig, it is a good wig for the price, though it takes some styling to get it looking like you want it to.</li>
      <li>It was much more real</li>
      <li>It is full and does not shed, like, at all.</li>
      <li>i love it so much</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it works for some people, just really didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
      <li>I really love this wig, its soft and easy to style.</li>
      <li>Black was in good condition, but the purple wig was coming apart at the top.</li>
      <li>I mean this is the perfect wig unless you&#x27;re looking for a Terezi Pyrope cosplay wig.</li>
      <li>Took some styling to get it to Terezi, but other than that it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re on a budget like me</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>It was very easy to style and soft.</li>
      <li>We were very pleased with the purchase and will buy again in the future.</li>
      <li>The wig is super soft and fluffy, and perfect for a homestuck cosplay.</li>
      <li>i am telling u its worth ur money trust me</li>
      <li>I loved the style of wig so much I&#x27;m also getting it in blonde for my Roxy lalonde cosplay.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>The hair fell right at my chin, but in the picture, it looks like it falls quite a bit longer.</li>
      <li>It is slightly small, but it&#x27;s a good fit for me.</li>
      <li>A very good wig, it works well with heat, is soft, and doesn&#x27;t show any netting from what I can see (although I did have a black wig cap).</li>
      <li>I had to straighten it a few times but it looked so amazing!</li>
      <li>Its very soft and light</li>
      <li>This wig is exactly as promised.  </li>
      <li>She had to work to get it on the first time</li>
      <li>the wig already comes pretty styled, which is rad if you are like me and cannot style.</li>
      <li>The fullness of the hair is outstanding, and the feathers look just like the photo above.</li>
      <li>and I definitely recommend it :)</li>
      <li>I bought this wig for my Terezi cosplay but it&#x27;s much shorter than it looks online!</li>
      <li>Looks exactly like the picture.  </li>
      <li>I was ideally using it for a terezi pyrope cosplay but it is a little short for my liking.</li>
      <li>Styled well and super soft to the touch.</li>
      <li>This wig looks really real</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know much about wigs</li>

    <li> The wig is super soft and fluffy, and perfect for a homestuck cosplay. (Nepeta, terezi.) It is a bit shorter than the picture, and it is a bit small. Also, prepare to style those bangs!</li>
    <li> Awesome wig. Great quality! Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> MY DAUGHTER LOVED IT. She uses it for her home stuck character. Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Not a bad wig, but the hair is much longer than I expected and a little hard to style.  No coverage problem and fits the head well.</li>
    <li> The wig is super soft and fluffy it&#x27;s easy for styling and all around a great wig</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great wig, yet quite shorter than the image depicted. I like it though. It&#x27;s comfortable and nicely styled, good for the price. Perfect for Terezi, Nepeta, and Kanaya from Homestuck!</li>
    <li> Looks exactly like the picture.  I have really thick hair though, so I definitely needed a hair cap to keep all my hair in.</li>
    <li> I was shopping for a wig that didn&#x27;t look cheap like the Halloween stores sell but couldn&#x27;t afford a super expensive one. I found this one and figured it was better than nothing (no offense yazilind). It was just what I was looking for! It looks very natural and it&#x27;s so soft! They were even nice enough to include some free gifts with my order!</li>
    <li> It looks and feels all natural.</li>
    <li> This wig is exactly as promised.  It&#x27;s a wonderful texture, almost like human hair, and has wonderful feathery styling.  It&#x27;s also very comfortable to wear, with almost no itching.</li>
    <li> This wig is amazing, it&#x27;s very full, it rarely ever sheds, and it stays like that. I bought it for my Terezi cosplay but it would be great for nepeta, or if trimmed kanaya. I loved the style of wig so much I&#x27;m also getting it in blonde for my Roxy lalonde cosplay. 10/10 would buy again.</li>
    <li> The wig is not as long as shown in the picture and only half of it was styled and was very hard to style within itself. I was ideally using it for a terezi pyrope cosplay but it is a little short for my liking. Shipping took a long time but was here by the date. For the price, its a good wig  but not the ideal length that is shows.</li>
    <li> The wig was shorter than expected. The hair fell right at my chin, but in the picture, it looks like it falls quite a bit longer. I was looking for something right above my shoulders, so this won&#x27;t work for my intended costume. It is too expensive to return, so I may use it in the future if I choose to cosplay another character. If you&#x27;re looking for an extremely short wig, it is a good wig for the price, though it takes some styling to get it looking like you want it to.</li>
    <li> I used this as a Terezi wig for a con and it worked Great! I had to straighten it a few times but it looked so amazing!</li>
    <li> This wig was perfect for a Terezi cosplay wig. It was very easy to style and soft. I&#x27;d suggest this to anyone in need of a Terezi wig.</li>
    <li> This wig didn&#x27;t fit correctly and looked awkward when I tried it on. I&#x27;m sure it works for some people, just really didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> so i am doing a homestuck rp and i bout the wig it came in befor the time set and ITS THE COLOR BLACK i love it so much i am telling u its worth ur money trust me</li>
    <li> I bought this for my kid to wear to Anime Con, but it&#x27;s such a nice wig she can wear it anywhere!</li>
    <li> Ordered both the black and purple wig. Black was in good condition, but the purple wig was coming apart at the top. I used some superglue to sort of fix it, but still was pretty poor condition. The purple wig was also a lot shorter than the black wig/advertised picture.</li>
    <li> the wig already comes pretty styled, which is rad if you are like me and cannot style. It is full and does not shed, like, at all. The only thing is that it is a bit shorter than what it looks like which is kinda common for wigs.</li>
    <li> My daughter was very happy with this wig. She ordered if for a Nilsey cosplay. Would order from this brand again.</li>
    <li> it is a very nice item, and the quality is good. But I give it four stars because was too small for me to wear, So just to be safe I will always just buy my wigs from inside of a beauty store.</li>
    <li> This wig is one of the best wigs i have ever gotten from here! Its very soft and light but the bangs are a bit to long but that can be easily fixed.The other thing is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a wig cap, you have to get that seperatly. All in all, it is an amazing wig an i highly recommend this wig for a terezi/nepeta/kanaya cosplay.</li>
    <li> VERY AWESOME WIG, LOOKS LIKE REAL HAIR! I GET ALOT OF COMPLIMENTS WHEN I WEAR IT:) THANK YOU! WILL BE BUYING FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN!:)</li>
    <li> A very good wig, it works well with heat, is soft, and doesn&#x27;t show any netting from what I can see (although I did have a black wig cap). It wasn&#x27;t styled straight out of the bag so I straightened it and cut the bangs and some of the length. It&#x27;s gonna work great for my Sam Manson cosplay!</li>
    <li> Took some styling to get it to Terezi, but other than that it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re on a budget like me</li>
    <li> I really love this wig, its soft and easy to style. It works great with my cosplay especially terezi. Sometimes I wear it too tight and it starts to hurt, even itch alot. Otherwise I love it</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig for my Terezi Pyrope cosplay, and I was neither impressed nor disappointed. The actual wig isn&#x27;t as full and fluffy as the picture shows, especially at the ends. There were lots of stray flyaway hairs, but those could be easily taimed with water or hairspray. I need to style it quite a bit but overall it is good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> This wig was super soft, as close to realistic as a synthetic wig can get, and styled perfectly for the cosplay I bought it for (Lady from DMC). It is slightly small, but it&#x27;s a good fit for me.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves it.</li>
    <li> This was my first cosplay wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and I have to say I&#x27;m really happy with the result! It arrived a good 10 days before it said it would, and fits well! The only thing to be warned about (which I was aware of before purchasing because of the reviews) is that it is a good few inches shorter than pictured. The hair is a bit thin in the back, but it looks fine and isn&#x27;t a problem for me at all. But yeah, the hair only reaches to about chin length, not almost shoulder like in the picture. I&#x27;ll be using it to cosplay Kanaya Maryam from Homestuck.</li>
    <li> Good quality and fit perfectly for Terezi. Came in good time and no damage during shipping.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised when I got this wig! It&#x27;s really soft and has a natural shine, and it hasn&#x27;t sent shed a single hair so far. The bangs came but that&#x27;s always expected and I need to restyle the bangs a bit to fit nepeta. This also is the perfect wig for terezi and kanaya!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my daughter for Cosplay/Halloween costume.  She absolutely loved it - it was the perfect style for her character.  The price was perfect for me!  Quality was very good (could not see through to the scalp as with some others).  We were very pleased with the purchase and will buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> Good fit and was thick but not TOO thick if you get what I mean.  I really like this wig and I definitely recommend it :)</li>
    <li> lovley wig, very soft. i use it for my terezi and nepeta cosplaying, as well as gamzee and kurloz, if you mess it up a bit it looks curly. a bit difficult to cut correctly but maybe thats just me :)</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig very happy with it</li>
    <li> The shipping was crazy fast, so that was great, but the product doesn&#x27;t look like the picture. I bought this wig for my Terezi cosplay but it&#x27;s much shorter than it looks online! The hair curves inward and it&#x27;s not styled except for a little in the back. The quality seems pretty good and if you need a shortish wig then it&#x27;s great. It would&#x27;ve gotten 5 stars if it hadn&#x27;t been for the in accuracy of the picture.</li>
    <li> My daughter needed this for Comic-Com Costume. It was much more real like then I&#x27;d ever expected. The price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> Super cute and comfortable to wear. Yes it looks like a wig.</li>
    <li> its shorter than i thought,but its still a decent wig.</li>
    <li> I ordered a couple of wigs for halloween. One was definitely a halloween wig with a lower quality. This one really stood out compared to the other. The hair is glossy and looks natural. The hair is a little shorter than pictured, ending just below my cheekbones but I love it. The cap is a little snug and since I have a low hairline I will need to work something out to hide those little extra hairs. However, great purchase, fast delivery and excellent value. Will shop from this seller again</li>
    <li> Lover it easy to style</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know much about wigs&lt;br /&gt;But this one is in very good condition and I like it a lot :)</li>
    <li> I received this wig and was a bit shocked to see it today, given the fact that it was expected to be here in a month from now! The shipping was easy, and when I pulled it out of the bag I was amazed by the fullness and thickness of it. I&#x27;ve boughten three wigs for Terezi already, and I&#x27;m hoping to keep this one for a long long time. The fullness of the hair is outstanding, and the feathers look just like the photo above.</li>
    <li> Not very thick, but hopefully it will do the job.</li>
    <li> I love everything about it exceeeept..... Well first thing it came styled, just the bangs were a little too long! I mean this is the perfect wig unless you&#x27;re looking for a Terezi Pyrope cosplay wig. It&#x27;s a bit too short but well it might work, if you have a small head. When I got it, I could adjust it to look more like Terezi, but some might confuse it for a Kanaya wig.</li>
    <li> Great deal.  Good wig for the price.</li>
    <li> The wig is very nice. I bought it for my Terezi cosplay and it just needs a bit of styling before I can wear it to con. The wig is light weight and fits my head perfectly</li>
    <li> When I took this wig out of the package I was kind of shocked because I was expecting it to look like the picture, however, the top of the wig does not lay down smoothly like in the picture. It sticks up on top, like someone took sections to add volume to it. I still like it and wear it, but if you want a sleek look at the top, this is not the wig to get. it is impossible to get the top to lay down flat.</li>
    <li> Got my wig today and it looks fantastic. Styled well and super soft to the touch. Honestly, my only complaint is that it could be a little thicker, but still looks great on</li>
    <li> The wig looks fine for the costume I am going to use it for but it is a little shorter than I thought it would be. The picture shows the hair going to the middle of her neck but on me it was slightly below chin length. This may be because of the size differences but it was shorter than I expected.</li>
    <li> This wig looks really real and I love how to fits. One complain I have though is that the bangs are not what you expect from the picture. They&#x27;re really long and require a good cutting. I used it for cosplays such as Terezi, Nepeta, and Kanaya from homestuck.</li>
    <li> This wig fits great, it&#x27;s color is great, but it&#x27;s extremely short. Like a shaggy male cut. I think I can make it work for my cosplay though...</li>
    <li> For the price paid I didn&#x27;t expect it to look so real, very happy with it</li>
    <li> It did not look as layered as in the picture but it was amazing. the style of the wig was perfect and its great for a terezi wig</li>
    <li> Wig was only styled on one side, was much shorted than shown in the picture and it was too small for my head!</li>
    <li> extremely short. Barely goes past the base of my neck.</li>
    <li> My sister says it was a little small for her. However she thinks it is a pretty good wig. She thinks it is of good quality. So it was a satisfactory purchase it would seem.&lt;br /&gt;I think we both agree that waiting for it to come in from China wasn&#x27;t as ideal, but it did come in during the period they told us it would come in by.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the wig however like other reviews of said the wig does run a bit small. She had to work to get it on the first time but now she wears it a lot.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect and feels like real hair!! Now I can cosplay Nepeta :33</li>
    <li> Got this wig for my Terezi cosplay and, with a little bit of temporary styling, I can also use it for my Dolorosa cosplay.  This is a wig of many uses! It&#x27;s really soft and looks great and didn&#x27;t need any styling out of the bag. All I had to do was bounce it on my hand a little. My friend even stole it for a while to use for her Terezi and Kanaya cosplays before she got her own.</li>
