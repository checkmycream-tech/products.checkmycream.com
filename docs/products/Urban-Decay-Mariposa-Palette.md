      <li>I was so happy because this is a birthday gift for my boyfriend&#x27;s sister and now I can use one for myself and the other 2 a christmas gift for my sisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful package, but the shadows are smaller than the shadows in a lot of other palettes I own from UD.  </li>
      <li>The colors are very pretty</li>
      <li>Delivery was reasonable!!</li>
      <li>the blue can be paired with the browns for a nice 2 shadow look.</li>
      <li>Its a fun palette to play with.</li>

      <li>I love urban decay eye shadows.</li>
      <li>Love Urban Decay!</li>
      <li>I love Urban Decay shadows and own a few palettes.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was pretty fast.</li>
      <li>Most kits are too large or they don&#x27;t snap closed to avoid messes.</li>
      <li>I wanted her to try it that much.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used it much yet.</li>
      <li>I absolutely would buy it again</li>
      <li>As with all UD eyeshadows their colors are intensely pigmented, and this palette is no exception.</li>
      <li>The shadows are very pigmented showing up and staying on all day.</li>
      <li>As always make sure you use primer before your shadow for maximum bold long lasting colors.</li>
      <li>Rockstar the dark purple is beautiful on dark eyes.</li>
      <li>Also comes with a cute little brush.</li>
      <li>have ordered urban decay in the past, was looking for some new colors, these stay on great, especially if I use their eye primer first</li>
      <li>They are by far my favorite colors, they are all highly pigmented and they last for so long!!</li>
      <li>Its a little large to carry in your purse unless you carry a very large purse.</li>
      <li>I use this pallet everyday, I love shading and mixing the colors and just playing with different looks.</li>
      <li>The pallet is pretty small, about the size of a CD case but like I said before, since the eye shadows are highly pigmented you don&#x27;t need to use as much.</li>
      <li>I am a huge UD fan and wanted to add a few colors to my Urban Decay arsenal.  </li>
      <li>Money beside Haight is a pale light greenish white almost.</li>
      <li>Mushroom is by far my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if it weren&#x27;t for the packaging this would definitely get 5 stars.</li>
      <li>Infamous the bright pink doesn&#x27;t show up quite what it looks like in  the palette.  </li>

    <li> I love this palette. I originally bought this for my stepmom for Mother&#x27;s Day, but I loved it so much, I kept it for myself and bought her the Jasmine palette instead (which she totally LOVED).</li>
    <li> The colors were gorgeous.  They go on light so you can wear them without being TOO bright but can easily add more color if needed.</li>
    <li> I am a huge UD fan and wanted to add a few colors to my Urban Decay arsenal.  This is a great addition.  Excellent pigment, smooth application all of which is standard with any UD item.  If you are thinking of buying it....Do it!!</li>
    <li> This palette has very beautiful pigmented colors and i am so satisfied. Shipping was pretty fast. IN LOVE with it thank you so much urban decay :D!</li>
    <li> This arrived early as I expected and comes in 5 palette when I thought it only comes in 1 palette.  I was so happy because this is a birthday gift for my boyfriend&#x27;s sister and now I can use one for myself and the other 2 a christmas gift for my sisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much for meeting my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep it up!</li>
    <li> Perfect for celebrating the New Year, and all year long! The colors go on smoothly and evenly, and can be easily varied in intensity. Lavish hues!</li>
    <li> I love this palette it came on time exactly as it was described. I am an URBAN DECAY nunkie so im in love with the beautiful highly pigmented shadows. The small brush that comes with it is great. Great sixe for you purse! Buy it! I absolutely would buy it again even the packaging is beautiful!:</li>
    <li> Great product. Great deal. Arived even before I expected. This was something I craved for a long long time. I apsolutely loooooveeeee ittttt</li>
    <li> I love this palette! I&#x27;m in love with Urban Decay products and they are well worth the complement. This palette has more cool colors in my opinion. I love it! The blues and plums blend well with the grey colors. The blues blend well with the beige tones as well to give a warmer look with an edge. Its a fun palette to play with. The brush is of excellent quality as well. The tin is embossed and beautiful. Its a little large to carry in your purse unless you carry a very large purse. The only reason I gave it a 4 star was because of the price and size. I feel it was a bit overpriced for the amount of product. I also felt that they could make something more functional to carry in your purse or handbag. Most kits are too large or they don&#x27;t snap closed to avoid messes. Otherwise, I love the product and would buy it again!</li>
    <li> Not a real Urban Decay Palette. Cute for a gift to a younger person.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s even better than the photo. I like this palette because even the brighter colors can still be neutral if you combine them correctly. I especially like the rush because it&#x27;s compact. I recommend this palette to Urban Decay lovers and newbies too.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this palette. I had wanted it for awhile now. I don&#x27;t know why I waited to get it. It is beautiful! The shadows are very pigmented showing up and staying on all day. The variety of colors is perfect for doing many different eye looks.</li>
    <li> This pallet is good.. I wear it everyday. .But how could it be bad its urban decay.. Need we say more!! UD.. Is the best eye shadows out there.</li>
    <li> I love Urban Decay shadows and own a few palettes.  I loved the metal container that the shadows come it.  It&#x27;s a beautiful package, but the shadows are smaller than the shadows in a lot of other palettes I own from UD.  I like the pigmentation of the shadows and the variety of colors that are in the palette.  The brush is nice, but I have not used it as I have other brushes that I use, but would be good for application and blending.  It was nice, but not quite worth the price.</li>
    <li> well, i feel like a total moron because i just got this on sunday and it is amazing the colors are so vivid and last very long they are gorgeous and the brush is nice to apply eyeshadow with i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Our daughter uses Urban Decay products all the time. She enjoyed Her Christmas gift of the Mariposa Palette we ordered.</li>
    <li> As with all UD eyeshadows their colors are intensely pigmented, and this palette is no exception. All of the colors blend beautifully. And a great variety of \\&quot;different\\&quot; colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is the palette can be a bit tough to open.</li>
    <li> Perfect for gift as well great colors to choose from and case is really nice for storage or travel.. Love Urban Decay!</li>
    <li> Great for on the go! The tin it comes in is very durable!!! The quality of the product is wonderful! Delivery was reasonable!!</li>

    <li> Love it... Is great, love the colors and it wasnt as expensive, comparing if you buy it at saphora... i couldnt wait to use it, now that i have it i use it often..</li>
    <li> Well where to start. The peachish color is called Skimp. I love this color but it was a limited edition color or something that you only get in a set. Beautiful highlighting color. As always make sure you use primer before your shadow for maximum bold long lasting colors. Infamous the bright pink doesn&#x27;t show up quite what it looks like in  the palette.  Had to blend as well. Rockstar the dark purple is beautiful on dark eyes. Below Skimp is Mushroom a brownish/gray color is nice for using in the crease to blend up into your highlighted or for an awesome natural look using the two colors beside it and the brown on the top row. Gunmetal top row 2nd one in is an awesome eyeliner or to work into a smokey eye look. Haight the blue can be paired with the browns for a nice 2 shadow look. Money beside Haight is a pale light greenish white almost. Haven&#x27;t used it much yet. This palette has only one maybe two glitter shades. The gold looking color and the bronze color. Also comes with a cute little brush. No mirror :( Bought one for a gift for one of my friends that I new wouldn&#x27;t purchase it on her own b/c I wanted her to try it that much. Love it..you will too.</li>
    <li> The packaging on this palette is cute, but a pain. It&#x27;s a serious fight to get the sucker open.&lt;br /&gt;However, the shadows are beautiful! A couple of them are oddly gritty and a not-so-fun texture (perhaps it&#x27;s just my palette) but otherwise the shadows are flawless. Mushroom is by far my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if it weren&#x27;t for the packaging this would definitely get 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This took FOREVER to get to me, but it was well worth the wait. The colors are beautiful. I love this palette.</li>
    <li> Urban decay palette came very fast and in great condition. The colors are very pretty and I even bought another one for my friend and she totally loved it too!</li>
    <li> Another great UD palette. Colors are great for morning looks as well as evening. Conveniently fits in any purse and easy to travel with. Small brush included.</li>
