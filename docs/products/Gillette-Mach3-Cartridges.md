    <li> Great price for blades.</li>
    <li> These blades are much less than I could buy from a local store.</li>
    <li> good product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good value&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;exactly what i wanted and expected&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will purchase again in the near future&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will recommend to others</li>
    <li> good price, fast shipping</li>
    <li> exactly what I needed for the razor at a good price..</li>
    <li> These cartridges are supposed to be for sale in India.  They are made in Poland so I cannot vouch for their quality and longevity.  The contents that arrived are 2 packs of 8 cartridges and 2 packs of 2 cartridges.  The 2 cartridges are supposed to be FREE when you buy the 8 pack!  The seller is thus charging for 10!  Buyer beware, the cost is lower than most for a reason.</li>
    <li> Mach 3 will always be a winner and for the price I paid I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> Yep, they&#x27;re razor blades. They&#x27;re Gillette Mach 3&#x27;s and the item performed as expected. I like the Mack 3&#x27;s and would buy them again.</li>
    <li> Blades are fine. Great price.</li>
    <li> It was already a bargain (relatively speaking) at two 10 packs for $34.  Normally two 10 packs would be around $50.  They apparently ran out of 10 packs and kindly sent three 8 packs instead.  So it cost 70 cents per blade instead of $2.50.  Not bad at all.</li>
    <li> Five stars is for the price. The quality is the same as every other Gillette blade you buy. I assume if you use a Mach3, you like the quality.</li>
    <li> These were exactly as described, Mach 3 razors. They worked just as other Mach 3&#x27;s do, although I did see, as other posters pointed out, that there is foreign writing on the label, but having sad that, they seem to be genuine Mach 3 blades.</li>

    <li> Very satisfied, always a good shave</li>
    <li> products shaves just perfect.</li>
    <li> Great price for this item.  Could not find a better price ANYWHERE for the same number of blades.</li>
    <li> My husband really goes through the razor blades, and at 1.75 each, it&#x27;s more affordable.  They came as 2- 8 packs, and 2 -2 packs, but I don&#x27;t care, we still got 20.</li>
    <li> Good price, exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Still the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used and this is where I found the best price for them.</li>
    <li> Just like the pictures showed.  Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Mach 3 is the only razor I use. I&#x27;ve tried the others that came afterward, and none of them have the same abilities as the Mach 3, especially shaving under the nose area. The seller shipped quickly and these are genuine Mach 3s. I&#x27;ve been stung on Ebay before, with what I would assume were factory discards that someone sold. Those literally cut my face up on the first use. No worries with this seller.</li>
    <li> It was fine.&lt;br /&gt;does the job.</li>
