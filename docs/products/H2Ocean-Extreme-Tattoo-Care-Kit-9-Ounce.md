      <li>excellent</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>They also have great products for piercing aftercare.</li>
      <li>My tattoos still look great.</li>
      <li>Great product, this is what my artist recommended and I can tell why.</li>
      <li>I have tried many of aftercare products for my tattoos, but this has always served as the best choice.&lt;br /&gt;+My</li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>A good unscented soap and Aquaphor are all you need to heal a tattoo.</li>
      <li>To be fair, I decided to use the foam soap and the ointment for one day before moving on to the cream.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice kit, comes with what you need to heal your tattoo and even includes instructions which is good for people who may not be experienced with healing tattoos.</li>
      <li>If you are going to pay for top notch work, why not make sure that you are using the best moisturizers?  </li>
      <li>and I was very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>I have continued to use the moisturizer and have been very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>i love it!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>Even heals amazing on those stubborn parts like the neck and pit of the elbow.</li>
      <li>The ointment is nice, but I&#x27;ve always just used A&amp;D.</li>
      <li>Nice kit with a neat pouch to hold the items (and keep even if you have expended the tubes).</li>
      <li>Absolutely the best aftercare product ive ever used.</li>
      <li>The best part about this particular kit is the soap.</li>
      <li>It was great kept my tattoo clean and protected until it was healed.  </li>
      <li>It takes away all ink and blood and is especially nice when it&#x27;s brand new.  </li>
      <li>The cream (to be used after 2 full days) never stings and is very nice.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best product on the market.</li>
      <li>but I do kind of wish they had a lil more direction for use.</li>
      <li>A good fragrance/paraben free moisturizing cream would surely suffice, I must say that the end result was satisfactory although I probably wouldn&#x27;t use again.</li>
      <li>All my tattoos have healed beautifully using H2Ocean and the color remains vibrant if you keep applying the lotion on it even after it has healed!</li>
      <li>The healing cream is smooth, so also real easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Taking care of your tattoo is more important than most people think, if you want it to look good for the rest of your life, and H2ocean is the stuff that works.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly!!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff</li>
      <li>The Aquatat is my favorite product in this bundle.</li>
      <li>The lotion (i.e., step #3) has to be reapplied often, so you may find you use more of that than anything else.</li>
      <li>I have alot of tattoos and have been in the business for many years.</li>
      <li>The whole pack work great.  </li>
      <li>I have used this for my last 3 tattoos and it&#x27;s wonderful!!!  </li>
      <li>I particularly love the soap.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I love it, won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
      <li>It never stings and works like magic.  </li>
      <li>Love the aquatat.</li>
      <li>and i needed to buy more.</li>
      <li>Better than Tattoo goo in my oppinion</li>
      <li>All in all, love their products.</li>
      <li>Heals w/o scabbing, a great product recommend highly.</li>
      <li>Great stuff for new tattoo&#x27;s</li>
      <li>The H2Ocean tattoo after care system works great for healing new tattoos.</li>
      <li>The soap is nice and gentle, and feels nice on my tattoo.</li>
      <li>Great kit for the money, complete kit for your tattoo care</li>
      <li>Good stuff, I like the soap as it is easy on a new tattoo.</li>
      <li>It glides on smooth and is easy to rub</li>
      <li>I love H2Ocean&#x27;s soap because its foaming and helps to get a deeper clean in tattoos and fresh piercings!</li>
      <li>would most certainly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
      <li>H2Ocean is amazing and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for brand new tattoos because it cools the red, irritated skin.</li>
      <li>Kept my tattoo clean and moist.</li>
      <li>The white bottle is great, it feels exactly like the gel used in shops when your tattoo is complete and provides a great protective coating for your tattoo during the first days of healing.</li>
      <li>It comes with instructions and a good amount to last you a while.</li>
      <li>overall it is a good quality pack for someone with tattoo experience.</li>
      <li>The two moisturizers worked tremendously.</li>
      <li>The soap is mild and works wekk.</li>
      <li>This aids tremendously in healing and relieving itch</li>
      <li>Did good on keeping my tattoo moist as long</li>
      <li>Exactly as described!</li>
      <li>H2Ocean is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>my tattoo is so soft and smooth!</li>
      <li>On the fresh ink, it burned just a little.&lt;br /&gt;Of</li>
      <li>The sea salt is kind harsh on the skin but in the end tattoos retain better color and healing afterwards.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t as good as I expected.</li>
      <li>I like the H2Ocean creams as they feel good on the skin, go on easy in the first few days of healing, and</li>
      <li>Amazing how well this product holds in dark and light colors.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle, but gets the job done!</li>
      <li>Just a dab of the lotions will do you, dont use too much!</li>
      <li>the initial investment I made in aftercare products, the Tattoo Goo was my favorite.</li>
      <li>I love the way this stuff feels and heals your tattoo, it has the same ingredients as aquaphor but not as greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>I purchased this after getting my first tattoo and having an allergic reaction to Aquaphor.</li>
      <li>Used this for my first tattoo</li>
      <li>be aware in case you think you are getting more product and find the exact same thing cheaper elsewhere.</li>
      <li>The sun reacted with the cream, and my entire leg turned bright red and began to itch.</li>
      <li>Popping into Walgreens on my way to work, I saw they had this kit available, but for a few dollars more than I could pick it up on Amazon.</li>
      <li>first night and morning after my nearly five hour ink session, I made do with my knock-off A&amp;D ointment (which had a better ingredient list than the real thing as the first item was carrot oil, before the mineral oil), and then during the day an unscented lotion that felt terrific and soothing.</li>
      <li>It cleared up once I got indoors, but I&#x27;m certain I had some sort of allergic reaction to the cream.</li>
      <li>Although, my tattoo isn&#x27;t that large.</li>
      <li>Would have liked a bigger set for further use but pretty pricy.</li>
      <li>Oh my enthusiasm for the array of aftercare products that have come on the market since my last new inking in 1998.&lt;br /&gt;Searching here on Amazon, the H2Ocean products and Tattoo Goo have the most dominance.</li>
      <li>Most of the positive ratings on this product that are written by customers are worded like advertisements for H2Ocean if you read carefully.</li>
      <li>Very highly recommended.</li>
      <li>It is very misleading.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice kit, comes with what you need to heal your tattoo and even includes instructions which is good for people who may not be experienced with healing tattoos.</li>
    <li> Best kit for tattoo&#x27;s. my tattoo never hurt or pealed badly with the use of this kit.</li>
    <li> Nice kit with a neat pouch to hold the items (and keep even if you have expended the tubes). Comes with clear instructions for use.&lt;br /&gt;Great for 10x10cm to 15cm x 15cm tattoo for the entire &#x27;course&#x27;, but if you&#x27;re doing a full sleeve or something bigger you might want to order extra.</li>
    <li> Best tattoo care kit. My healing process is less than a week using H2Ocean.  Has everything you need for immediate aftercare and continued care of new tattoos. Enough product in the kit to take care of a couple of new tats. Have purchased for friends and even my tattoo artist. Everyone sings the praises of this product.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done. The cleanser almost just feels like you are putting water on but, it seems to work. The white bottle is great, it feels exactly like the gel used in shops when your tattoo is complete and provides a great protective coating for your tattoo during the first days of healing.</li>
    <li> For color tacs  the best thing on the market</li>
    <li> Best tattoo after care</li>
    <li> Wow!! I got a new tattoo May 23rd and already (June 4) my tattoo is so soft and smooth! No flaking or itching.  H2Ocean is amazing and I highly recommend it. I also cut my finger pretty bad and per an RN (I work in a hospital) should have had stitches ... I&#x27;m stubborn and wouldn&#x27;t go to the ER. I used the cleanser and lotion on my cut .... 8 days later you can hardly see where I cut it!</li>
    <li> Used this for my first tattoo and I was very pleased with it. It comes with instructions and a good amount to last you a while. Although, my tattoo isn&#x27;t that large.</li>
    <li> I recently used the H2Ocean Extreme Tattoo Care Kit for my first tattoo and was pleased overall, the Blue Green Foam Soap was quite soothing &amp; handy and equal to Tattoo Shop Green Soap quality, at 1.7 oz this will last approximately 2 weeks, at which point I switched to a high quality pure castile soap. My only concern with this product is that the third and final step of Ocean Care cream contained parabens . A good fragrance/paraben free moisturizing cream would surely suffice, I must say that the end result was satisfactory although I probably wouldn&#x27;t use again.</li>
    <li> I have alot of tattoos and have been in the business for many years. This is by far the best product on the market. This kit comes with everything you need from day one of the tattoo until it completely heals. It also comes with a directional card to let you know which products to use at which times during the healing process, which is really helpful for those new to tattoos or new to H2Ocean Products. Yes, this may seem like a high price. But consider this, how much did you just spend on that new tattoo? Dont you want it to look new for years to come? Protect your investment and BUY H2OCEAN!</li>
    <li> Keeps my tattoo moisturized throughout the day and has it looking brand new!  I just wish it came in larger sizes.</li>
    <li> Works really fast in healing tattoos better than any other product I&#x27;ve used. Heals w/o scabbing, a great product recommend highly.</li>
    <li> only tattoo product i use</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best aftercare product ive ever used. Amazing how well this product holds in dark and light colors. Product also expediates healing time drastically. No flaking or scabbing on every tattoo ive gotten. Even heals amazing on those stubborn parts like the neck and pit of the elbow. Only negative thing i have to say is if you are getting a larger tattoo you should definetly order an extra bottle of the blue green soap because it runs out fast.</li>
    <li> Great kit for the money, complete kit for your tattoo care</li>
    <li> I love H2Ocean&#x27;s soap because its foaming and helps to get a deeper clean in tattoos and fresh piercings! The Aquatat is my favorite product in this bundle. It&#x27;s perfect for brand new tattoos because it cools the red, irritated skin. It might seem like a really small package but you don&#x27;t need to use a lot, so the price is worth it! Just apply a very thin layer and it&#x27;ll last you a while! All my tattoos have healed beautifully using H2Ocean and the color remains vibrant if you keep applying the lotion on it even after it has healed!</li>
    <li> I tried a few different products when I got my sleeve done, and I honestly don&#x27;t notice much of a difference between any of them. The best part about this particular kit is the soap. It is the only thing I have used that didn&#x27;t completely dry out my tattoo after using it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Everything you need for a new tattoo. I purchased this after getting my first tattoo and having an allergic reaction to Aquaphor. It&#x27;s gentle, but gets the job done! And a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> all of these products work really well together for your new tattoo. the only complaint that i would have is the size of the tubes are not that big. I got a 1/2 started and i needed to buy more.</li>
    <li> The blue green soap came apart when I opened it so I lost most of it down the drain and it kinda smells like cat pee when it&#x27;s opened</li>
    <li> Ordered the 9oz bottles. I&#x27;ve used the 9oz before so I ordered a second set and they sent me the 6 oz set. I have to call them now and see if they can fix this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after getting a new tattoo and I wanted all the necessary items in one set. The soap is mild and works wekk. It does not dry out the skin and is gentle on a healing tattoo. The two moisturizers worked tremendously. I had very little scabbing and the skin remained soft and supple. I have continued to use the moisturizer and have been very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I have tried many of aftercare products for my tattoos, but this has always served as the best choice.&lt;br /&gt;+My healing time has been cut down by 4 or 5 days;&lt;br /&gt;+No scabbing on tattoos;&lt;br /&gt;+No itching during healing time;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this product and this is actually my 2nd set.&lt;br /&gt;I would most certainly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> This is the best tattoo aftercare I&#x27;ve ever used. My new tattoo was fully healed in 10 days. Very little peeling as the new skin developed and no signs of a scab at all. Very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I wish I could write the review solely on Amazon&#x27;s Description of this product. It is very misleading. You are not getting 9 ounces of the product. You are getting 5.95 Fl Oz. The title clearly states 9 Ounces (maybe that the total weight, but why even put it in the title.)&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the break down:&lt;br /&gt;Blue Green Foam Soap: 1.7 Fl Oz&lt;br /&gt;Aquatat: 1.75 Fl Oz&lt;br /&gt;Ocean Care Moisturizer: 2.5 Fl Oz.&lt;br /&gt;Just be aware in case you think you are getting more product and find the exact same thing cheaper elsewhere. Other than that I highly recommend the kit for small to medium size tattoos, larger tattoos may require 2-3 kits. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> I know everyone who has tattoos are as regimental about them as some people are with their cars. There is always a grea debate on what gives you the best outcome when it comes to healing a new tattoo, But I have to say I have tried different methods and on my last two tattoos I used this exactly as was instructed and my tattoos stayed as clear and sharp as the day I got them. Better than Tattoo goo in my oppinion</li>
    <li> Met my expectations and then some. Great products!!</li>
    <li> It was great kept my tattoo clean and protected until it was healed.  Will use this on every tattoo I get.</li>
    <li> Great product, this is what my artist recommended and I can tell why.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described! Shipped quickly!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the lotion for years and I love it. The ointment is nice, but I&#x27;ve always just used A&amp;D. The foam is really thin and liquidy, but I guess it gets the job done as an antibacterial. All in all, love their products. They also have great products for piercing aftercare.</li>
    <li> The soap was fine, but the other products burned like hell. The lotion and ointment have parabens in them so I&#x27;d stay away from them.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, I like the soap as it is easy on a new tattoo. The healing cream is smooth, so also real easy to apply. The lotion (i.e., step #3) has to be reapplied often, so you may find you use more of that than anything else. I recently purchased the tattoo sunscreen since I live in Hawaii; I use it everyday. I like the H2Ocean creams as they feel good on the skin, go on easy in the first few days of healing, and they don&#x27; seem to give a haze that other creams do. I have used aquaphor previously, but will continue with the H2Ocean from now on.</li>
    <li> Did good on keeping my tattoo moist as long I applied it every couple of hours.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t as good as I expected. Small product size for the price.</li>
    <li> Worked well, tattoo healed wonderfully, after use my skin would break out</li>
    <li> Oh my enthusiasm for the array of aftercare products that have come on the market since my last new inking in 1998.&lt;br /&gt;Searching here on Amazon, the H2Ocean products and Tattoo Goo have the most dominance. I&#x27;d still not decided the day before my appointment. Popping into Walgreens on my way to work, I saw they had this kit available, but for a few dollars more than I could pick it up on Amazon. I knew with Prime I could have it in two days, so I ordered (in addition to the Ultimate Tattoo Care kit and a tin of Tattoo Goo). It&#x27;s all skin products. I have skin. I&#x27;ll find uses.&lt;br /&gt;My first night and morning after my nearly five hour ink session, I made do with my knock-off A&amp;D ointment (which had a better ingredient list than the real thing as the first item was carrot oil, before the mineral oil), and then during the day an unscented lotion that felt terrific and soothing. When I got my order, I tore in to my collection. Only to be surprised that there&#x27;s 41% petrolatum listed as the active ingredient on the Aquatat ointment.&lt;br /&gt;Huh, the tattoo artist aftercare directions that I&#x27;ve been reading about the web, and the directions my artist had suggested, all educated me that vaseline and A&amp;D were no longer the way to go. Mineral oil leeches some of the color.&lt;br /&gt;So this is the brand that&#x27;s made my people in the industry? Maybe they&#x27;d not gotten the memo regarding petrolatum. And how is it that all the other aftercare brands I&#x27;d been considering managed to be paraben-free?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not one to complain about investing in skincare, but this feels like cheap goods dressed up in its already dated-looking useless fuzzy pouch.&lt;br /&gt;I used the cleansing foam as my antibacterial soap at work. Applied the Aquatat only once to experience what it felt like, and the moisturizing cream got used a scant few times just by merit of the small size being something easy to throw in my bag. On the fresh ink, it burned just a little.&lt;br /&gt;Of the initial investment I made in aftercare products, the Tattoo Goo was my favorite. Though I have gone on to continue to experiment with other items.products, the Tattoo Goo was my favorite. Though I have gone on to continue to experiment with other items.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff but I do kind of wish they had a lil more direction for use. You&#x27;re supposed to use the foam soap and the ointment but the next time you go to use the soap the directions say to rub until dry . Well the ointment makes that nearly impossible it keeps the soap too moist lol.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used. One review said the ointment was too thick. Not sure what he was using, but this stuff is easy to apply and no where near as thick as other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I received this product on day three of my tattoo healing process. To be fair, I decided to use the foam soap and the ointment for one day before moving on to the cream. The soap is nice and gentle, and feels nice on my tattoo. The ointment is thick and very protective. Today, after washing with the soap, I put the cream on my tattoo. It&#x27;s thick, and rubs in nicely. It felt great until I walked from my car to a building in the sun. The sun reacted with the cream, and my entire leg turned bright red and began to itch. It cleared up once I got indoors, but I&#x27;m certain I had some sort of allergic reaction to the cream. Please be careful using this product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for new tattoo&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I really did like the product just the amount of product was not enough for a big tattoo would be fine for a small to medium tattoos</li>
    <li> I love the way this stuff feels and heals your tattoo, it has the same ingredients as aquaphor but not as greasy feeling. Taking care of your tattoo is more important than most people think, if you want it to look good for the rest of your life, and H2ocean is the stuff that works.</li>
    <li> I have used this for my last 3 tattoos and it&#x27;s wonderful!!!  I particularly love the soap.  It takes away all ink and blood and is especially nice when it&#x27;s brand new.  It never stings and works like magic.  The ointment is light and thin and also soothing.  The cream (to be used after 2 full days) never stings and is very nice.  This is my new tattoo treatment forever.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> If you are going to pay for top notch work, why not make sure that you are using the best moisturizers?  It would be a shame to see all that hard work go down the drain, all because you didn&#x27;t want to pony up $20.  Do yourself a favor and buy this kit.  It&#x27;s one stop shopping and it has everything you need.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Kept my tattoo clean and moist. Just a dab of the lotions will do you, dont use too much!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great. Love the aquatat. Basically same as aquafor but spreads easier and seems to last a little longer. Working on cover ups which are very deep. This aids tremendously in healing and relieving itch</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with this product. I am about halfway through a large back piece and I have tried multiple different healing products. H2Ocean is by far my favorite. It glides on smooth and is easy to rub in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason this product will not receive 5 stars from me is because when I ordered the 9oz size, I was sent the 6 oz. size. I can see that other customers have had this same complaint.</li>
    <li> good stuff but poor service</li>
    <li> The H2Ocean tattoo after care system works great for healing new tattoos. I love it, won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I gave this 3 stars due to its small size.</li>
    <li> The whole pack work great.  I still have plenty in lotion tube.</li>
    <li> The only product I would use in this kit is the skin moisturizing cream to shine up an already healed tattoo. The soap is garbage, just use unscented Dove soap. The Aquatat ointment is garbage, just use Aquaphor. Aquatat dries out in like 30 minutes. I am 39 and have been getting tattooed since I was 18. My tattoos still look great. There goes the theory that Aquaphor causes tattoos to lose color. I have never gotten an infection. There goes the theory that Aquaphor causes infections ( wash with Dove or other unscented soap before applying Aquaphor ). I used the H2Ocean kit one time and stopped during mid heal and went back to Aquaphor due to excessive skin dry out resulting in the tattoo having to be gone over again. Most of the positive ratings on this product that are written by customers are worded like advertisements for H2Ocean if you read carefully. A good unscented soap and Aquaphor are all you need to heal a tattoo. Keep in mind that you will spend half on Dove and Aquaphor than you will on this kit. H2Ocean is just a marketing ploy to get you to spend a lot of money on an inferior product. Don&#x27;t believe the hype. You have been warned.</li>
    <li> arrived before I got home from Florida! excellent</li>
    <li> I like that it is an all in one kit. I keep one at home and the office.</li>
    <li> I use it for all of my tattoos! i love it!</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected! Was not happy with pricing on this for such a small package,. Used the entire package through  2 tattoos. The healing process is rough with this (fast, dried out and rough patches) overall it is a good quality pack for someone with tattoo experience. The sea salt is kind harsh on the skin but in the end tattoos retain better color and healing afterwards. Would have liked a bigger set for further use but pretty pricy.</li>
