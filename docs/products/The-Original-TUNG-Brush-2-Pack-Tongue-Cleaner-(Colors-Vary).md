      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>You will love it.</li>
      <li>These are good too but not quite as good as the old one.</li>
      <li>The brush is a good size and shape and works very well.</li>
      <li>and I STRONGLY recommend them.</li>
      <li>After a couple of days it is fine.</li>

      <li>awesome little tool!</li>
      <li>These are a must for keeping your mouth feeling fresh!</li>
      <li>B007JLVE6M 4 Pack - TUNG Gel - Tongue Cleaner - Fresh Mint]])</li>
      <li>, I can&#x27;t say anything about tongue scrapper yet because these work so effectively that I had no use to open metal tongue scrapper.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so worth the money.</li>
      <li>have used a variety of tongue cleaners in the past, and the TUNG brush is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>Also, I have very dry lips and will sometimes lightly run the brush over them to exfoliate and keep them looking healthy.</li>
      <li>tongue is cleaner than ever, feels cleaner than ever, and breath is fresher for much much longer!</li>
      <li>Better than brushing your tongue with a regular brush.</li>
      <li>Well I gave these a try first</li>
      <li>Keeps my tongue nice and pink!</li>
      <li>If these don&#x27;t work for you, I strongly recommend seeking medical help.</li>
      <li>These work really well.</li>
      <li>The price is reasonable, the product is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I saw great review for these AND a metal tongue scraper I bought both in other to satisfy my obsession with having bubble gum pink color tongue.</li>
      <li>I loved my previous brush (same manufacturer).</li>
      <li>Briefly brush it over your gums and problem areas and swallow it immediately, which will help sterilize and protect your mouth and leave it minty fresh, while reducing the viral load on the rest of your body.</li>
      <li>and it really gives my mouth an extra level of clean rather than only brushing my teeth.</li>
      <li>and I just take it and brush in a downwards direction over my tongue and my tongue gets clean and pink</li>
      <li>The tongue is a filthy animal, keep it clean with this brush, its great.</li>
      <li>I mean nothing works better than these.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s important not to press too hard</li>
      <li>These new brushes seem like they have shorter and harder bristles than the old brush.</li>
      <li>Pretty much a waste of money.</li>

    <li> Keeps my tongue nice and pink!</li>
    <li> Better than brushing your tongue with a regular brush. Seems to remove all the bacteria/residue from the tongue, that a regular toothbrush leaves behind.</li>
    <li> These are a must for keeping your mouth feeling fresh! I only use my Tung brush once a day and it really gives my mouth an extra level of clean rather than only brushing my teeth. I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s important not to press too hard so the tongue doesn&#x27;t hurt and so the bottom of my tongue won&#x27;t be pressed into my teeth and become sore (when my tongue is extended). Also, I have very dry lips and will sometimes lightly run the brush over them to exfoliate and keep them looking healthy.</li>
    <li> Just buy it.  It&#x27;s the only tongue brush you&#x27;ll ever need unless you lose it.  And yea, you definitely need a tongue brush. Then follow up with 3 or 4 drops of ie. oil of wintergreen on your toothbrush.  Briefly brush it over your gums and problem areas and swallow it immediately, which will help sterilize and protect your mouth and leave it minty fresh, while reducing the viral load on the rest of your body.</li>
    <li> Ha!  I thought this was another one of those gimmicky products but I am totally satisfied and pleased with this Tung brush. I bought one for my husband and he loves it too - surprise! Fast delivery and a great product - my tongue and breath are happy!</li>
    <li> Pretty much a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It just cleans your tongue - that&#x27;s it! Just what it says it will do. Incredible product.</li>
    <li> This works great for brushing your tongue in the morning and cleans easily.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I use them every day. Be careful at the beginning as it scrapes your tongue off. After a couple of days it is fine. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I bought the  item for my daughter.  She had been looking for this item and being that we live in a small town we don&#x27;t always have a place that sells some of the things we want.  She was happy to get it and it was the brand that she wanted.  She had had this item before and really liked it.  She said it worked well and was glad that I had bought more than one.</li>
    <li> awesome little tool! tongue is cleaner than ever, feels cleaner than ever, and breath is fresher for much much longer!</li>
    <li> These work really well. They make a big difference and don&#x27;t make you gag.</li>
    <li> The price is reasonable, the product is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a variety of tongue cleaners in the past, and the TUNG brush is by far the best.  In conjunction with the gel ([[ASIN:B007JLVE6M 4 Pack - TUNG Gel - Tongue Cleaner - Fresh Mint]]) it will make cleaning your tongue quick, easy, and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In truth, I find using this brush alone is sufficient, though I use the gel from time to time.  I bought mine a year ago, and it&#x27;s still working fine - I note no differences between mine and the one I just purchased for my girlfriend, with regards to efficacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be cautious with the pressure you apply when using as you can very easily draw blood and hurt your tongue if not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a tongue cleaner, this is your best bet.</li>
    <li> The tongue is a filthy animal, keep it clean with this brush, its great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these tongue brushes for years.  The thought of the metal or plastic tongue scrapers freak me out but this brush is great.&lt;br /&gt;It has a round, flat profile with short, stiff bristles and I just take it and brush in a downwards direction over my tongue and my tongue gets clean and pink and then I wash the brush with some soap, rinse it and let it dry.  You will love it.</li>
    <li> I had one of those plastic tongue scapers which did not work for me. When I saw great review for these AND a metal tongue scraper I bought both in other to satisfy my obsession with having bubble gum pink color tongue. Well I gave these a try first, I can&#x27;t say anything about tongue scrapper yet because these work so effectively that I had no use to open metal tongue scrapper. I feel like buying a few of those and introduce my friends to it. I plan to have one of those always. If these don&#x27;t work for you, I strongly recommend seeking medical help. Your problem might be bigger than you think. THESE WORK GREAT, that&#x27;s the bottle line and I STRONGLY recommend them. It&#x27;s so worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is the best unit of its type on the market.  And very hard to find.  They are pricey but last a very long time.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes after deciding to replace the TUNG brush that I had been using for quite some time. I loved my previous brush (same manufacturer). These are good too but not quite as good as the old one. I think the company may have made some changes to the bristles. These new brushes seem like they have shorter and harder bristles than the old brush. It&#x27;s still a great product. The brush is a good size and shape and works very well. It&#x27;s just not quite as good as they used to be.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years.  I love it.  It does the job</li>
    <li> The best tongue brushes!</li>
    <li> Everyone should own one.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a must-have</li>
    <li> Love this product and have switched from brushing and then scraping....leaves a lovely taste in my mouth...</li>
    <li> Nothing and I mean nothing works better than these.  If you&#x27;re sick of gagging on your toothbrush, dragging scrappers across without much result, try one of these.  I buy them for friends and family members now.  I just got one for a friend and she&#x27;s addicted.  Now she&#x27;s buying them for her family members.</li>
