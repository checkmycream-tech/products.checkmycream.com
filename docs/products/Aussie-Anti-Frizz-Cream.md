      <li>Is a good product, but not to use after brushing.</li>
      <li>3 minute miracle works better for frizz than this does!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>allows for nice curls, holds hair in place, kinda like mousse</li>
      <li>Excellent product that take away the frizz out but leaves your hair natural and manageable.  </li>
      <li>This stuff will literally save you from the need/urge to put heat on your hair most days of the week;.</li>
      <li>Love this product over leave-in conditioner.</li>
      <li>I have quite fine frizzy and flyaway hair, and this is amazing for smoothing my hair and helping me get a really smooth finish.  </li>
      <li>Having loose curls, this is the best stuff to use.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair looks more smooth.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much of the product to go over most of your hair.</li>
      <li>It works well, but you don&#x27;t get very much for what you pay for.</li>
      <li>I tried many different products and all of them filed me!</li>
      <li>I saw this product for the first time about a year ago and decided to give it a go.</li>
      <li>Only Assuie was able to help me with my frizzy unmanageable hair.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, it was so sticky, it felt like I had poured Syrup on my hand, and when I attempted to run my hands through my hair, my hands literally got stuck by the cream.</li>
      <li>Without this product I wear my hair straight.</li>
      <li>However I had the same \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; feeling when I tried to run it though my hair, on top of this my hair is starting to harden, almost like what happens when you put hairspray in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The new &amp;#34;gel version&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Works really well even with very long hair.</li>
      <li>This is the only product I can use for my curly hair that helps with frizz &amp; gives me soft curls!  </li>
      <li>; product they came out with is nowhere near the same quality or performance.</li>

    <li> this is not as good as the one i got before</li>
    <li> Having loose curls, this is the best stuff to use.  It does not make your hair look like crunchy noodles like gel does.</li>
    <li> Another conditioning cream that comes in a tiny bottle. It works well, but you don&#x27;t get very much for what you pay for.</li>
    <li> caution! these aussie products caused my hair to fall out! I was using this antifrizz along with the antifrizz shampoo and conditioner. it contains an ingredient which probably causes an allergic reaction on my skin. if you use this product and notice massive amounts of hair loss, STOP USING IT! the hair loss should stop after 1-2 weeks after using this product.</li>
    <li> The only way my hair makes it through the day; and the only reason I stay sane.</li>
    <li> It is a good product, but using it after brush my hair didn´t bring the result I expect. Is a good product, but not to use after brushing.</li>
    <li> Works really well even with very long hair.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t find this in the stores anymore, but this is a great product. Leaves your hair under control, but not stickey or anything like that.</li>
    <li> I saw this product for the first time about a year ago and decided to give it a go. The first time I used it, it was so sticky, it felt like I had poured Syrup on my hand, and when I attempted to run my hands through my hair, my hands literally got stuck by the cream. I put it away and switched over to Garnier Fructis Style Sleek and Shine Cream. About a year later I discovered it in my bathroom again, and decided to give it one last go. Again, it was sticky, but i tried to rub it out in my hands for a while, it seemed to help. However I had the same \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; feeling when I tried to run it though my hair, on top of this my hair is starting to harden, almost like what happens when you put hairspray in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a fan. Will not be buying again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair Length: Long (mid back) to Reverse Bob (used the last time)&lt;br /&gt;Hair Thickness: Thick, Wavy.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that take away the frizz out but leaves your hair natural and manageable.  Too bad that it can&#x27;t be found anywhere but online any more. Hope they don&#x27;t stop making this product. The new &amp;#34;gel version&amp;#34; product they came out with is nowhere near the same quality or performance.</li>
    <li> (I have long thick hair) I was really disappointed with Aussie on this product, never had trouble with their products ; but this didn&#x27;t work for me. I have to use triple the amount snd there is not mu h on there to begin with. 3 minute miracle works better for frizz than this does!</li>
    <li> I tried many different products and all of them filed me! Only Assuie was able to help me with my frizzy unmanageable hair.</li>
    <li> This is great anti-frizz hair cream.</li>
    <li> Works in florida, so if that isn&#x27;t proof enough I don&#x27;t know what is.</li>
    <li> I have quite fine frizzy and flyaway hair, and this is amazing for smoothing my hair and helping me get a really smooth finish.  Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I like it. It makes my hair looks more smooth.</li>
    <li> Love this product over leave-in conditioner. If you&#x27;re trying to grow hair out, we all know that heat is bad for your hair. This stuff will literally save you from the need/urge to put heat on your hair most days of the week;. You don&#x27;t need much of the product to go over most of your hair. I don&#x27;t recommend people with oil scalp use it close to the root.</li>
    <li> allows for nice curls, holds hair in place, kinda like mousse</li>
    <li> This is the only product I can use for my curly hair that helps with frizz &amp; gives me soft curls!  Without this product I wear my hair straight. Love this product!</li>
