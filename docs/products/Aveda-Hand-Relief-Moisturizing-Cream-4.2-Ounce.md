      <li>Best, longest lasting hand cream I have ever used</li>
      <li>This should be on Oprah&#x27;s list of her favorite things she goes over every year at Christmas.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping and great packaging.  </li>
      <li>I love any AVEDA products to begin with.  </li>
      <li>Hers smelled more earthy which I preferred.</li>
      <li>Love this lotion.</li>
      <li>Kind of pricy but worth it!</li>
      <li>I does remain effective through 2-3 washings and even did this while I working full time in nursing.  </li>
      <li>I use it several times a day at work in the winter and it has a light fragrance and a wonderful texture that immediately softens hands.</li>
      <li>It smells really nice and fresh, and not as smelly as some Aveda products tend to be.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t smell strongly of perfume...</li>
      <li>Hands down (no pun intended) the best hand cream ever!</li>
      <li>Nice texture, not sticky or greasy, fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>Lots of botanicals and a light fragrance.</li>
      <li>To me, the scent in this one is light and seems spa-like, and applying it creates a moment of relaxation in the day.</li>
      <li>would definitely recommend it, because it is the best lotion I have found so far.</li>
      <li>This lotion smells fabulous, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  </li>
      <li>it was received quickly and packaged well.  </li>
      <li>my extreme case, Aveda has greatly reduced the pain, but it is sadly not a miracle</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>Pricey but worth it.  </li>
      <li>This lotion is spendy, but I have loved other Aveda products and decided to give a try.&lt;br /&gt;It is not greasy, and it absorbs well.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and keeps my hands from going dry and cracking in the winter.</li>
      <li>I Like it very much.</li>
      <li>They do have a travel size if you want to try that first.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product especially in the winter.</li>
      <li>aware, its cheaper to buy in the store or on the aveda website (for $21)</li>
      <li>Very hydrating !</li>
      <li>But when I come here to the Amazon site their pricing is higher than it is in the salon.</li>
      <li>and I can still feel it on my hands many hours later.</li>
      <li>I am becoming more and more disillusioned with Amazon&#x27;s false advertising, and higher than normal prices.</li>
      <li>It has a nice, light citrus sent and it is really long lasting - not greasy!</li>
      <li>The smell is light and barely noticeable, which is a quality that I really like in a hand</li>
      <li>Very soothing.  </li>
      <li>Not irritating to the skin.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I really like this lotion I feel it is better than average.  </li>
      <li>You need to use VERY little on your hands, and they will feel amazing and refreshed.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>If they are honest, they will at least publish this review.</li>
      <li>I had been given trial size tubes in the past, and got hooked, but I wasn&#x27;t sure it was worth the cost for only 4oz.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s rich, so rich that just a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>In the winter, my hands always looked scaly and rough around my fingernails ... but not with this lotion, and it works quickly.</li>
      <li>It has an interesting smell - not flowery - hard to describe.</li>
      <li>I used it everyday for a week, and my hands were soft, smooth and hydrated.</li>
      <li>but you can buy it directly from Aveda for around $23</li>
      <li>So buyer beware do not buy from Amazon for it will be cheaper at your near by salon that carries Aveda products.</li>
      <li>This works really well to keep the moisture in even after you have washed your hands several time during the day.</li>
      <li>We both have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Really works well on dry and chapped hands.</li>
      <li>A little pricey, but worth it.  </li>
      <li>It is thick but it soaks in and keeps my skin smooth.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best hand lotion ever!</li>
    <li> The Aveda Hand Relief was requested as a present. It was easy to find, a great product, fair price and very quick shipping. She loved it and I would purchase again from this vendor.</li>
    <li> This product is over priced on this site.  It is a great product but you can buy it directly from Aveda for around $23</li>
    <li> Best, longest lasting hand cream I have ever used</li>
    <li> Best hand cream on the market.</li>
    <li> Love the cream. Worth the price. Had been driving a distance to get at salon but thought I&#x27;d try Amazon. Great experience. Ordered it late at night on spur of the moment. It came within 48 hours.</li>
    <li> This lotion is spendy, but I have loved other Aveda products and decided to give a try.&lt;br /&gt;It is not greasy, and it absorbs well. It has an interesting smell - not flowery - hard to describe. The smell is not too bad, but I would prefer unscented if possible.&lt;br /&gt;I abuse my hands badly in the outdoors during the winter time and it would take a miracle cure to keep them from cracking and bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;In my extreme case, Aveda has greatly reduced the pain, but it is sadly not a miracle cure.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it, because it is the best lotion I have found so far. I hope they come up with a miracle soon.</li>
    <li> I do not like the feeling of heavy lotions and I can hardly stand chapstick. I work in a hospital that this lotion helps to keep my hands from cracking and bleeding. It is thick but it soaks in and keeps my skin smooth. It also smells good having a unique smell. They do have a travel size if you want to try that first.</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream. It smells great, is non-irritating, and is super hydrating. It can be a little greasy, so it should be used sparingly or before bed. I don&#x27;t purchase anything except for this!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s rich, so rich that just a little goes a long way. It smells really nice and fresh, and not as smelly as some Aveda products tend to be. I love it.</li>
    <li> We only paid $20 on Amazon...this seems like alot for hand cream, but this one really works, smells great and you only need a dab so it lasts forever, it seems. We LOVE it!!!!! My husband uses it too...it doesn&#x27;t smell strongly of perfume...like going out in your herb garden.</li>
    <li> Love love love this hand lotion!! Does great job and pleasant smell. Always use it.  Aveda  has the best hand lotion.</li>
    <li> sent this to a relative to try.  she lives in an area where this product was not easily available.  it was received quickly and packaged well.  will use again.</li>
    <li> Aveda Hand Relief is the bomb!  It is a great hand cream and smells wonderful. Kind of pricy but worth it!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hand lotion product I have ever used. You need to use VERY little on your hands, and they will feel amazing and refreshed. The smell is light and barely noticeable, which is a quality that I really like in a hand lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will use again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware, its cheaper to buy in the store or on the aveda website (for $21)</li>
    <li> Aveda Hand Relief is the best hand cream I have ever used.  My hands stay moisturized even after washing in warm water. It absorbs immediately and, there is no odor at all.  It only takes a little  and it lasts a long time. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been hooked on this product since I borrowed this lotion from a friend of mine. It has a nice, light citrus sent and it is really long lasting - not greasy!</li>
    <li> I love any AVEDA products to begin with.  This lotion smells fabulous, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  I have used this product for over a year. Very hydrating !</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. I&#x27;ve been buying it for  for years. Glad I can buy it through amazon.  Spa like smell</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product especially in the winter. I just dislike the price but that&#x27;s Aveda items for you...</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizing product that I will use on my hands.  Everything else pales in comparison.If I&#x27;m in a crunch and use something else, I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> My manicurist recommended Aveda for my dry, painfully cracked hands.  This is the best I have ever used and I have tried everything.  Pricey but worth it.  Fast shipping and great packaging.  Purchased the foot lotion too.</li>
    <li> This should be on Oprah&#x27;s list of her favorite things she goes over every year at Christmas.  It replaces the moisture you need but doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling greasy. I does remain effective through 2-3 washings and even did this while I working full time in nursing.  I didn&#x27;t wash my hands but scrubbed them for several minutes at a time with harsh liquid soap.</li>
    <li> The best hand lotion ever.  Smells great too. Very soothing.  My favorite.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Really works well on dry and chapped hands. Works for &amp;#34;finger cracks&amp;#34; brought on by dry weather. Not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Excellent product but, pricey!</li>
    <li> Aveda Hand Relief Lotion is a must for me during the colder seasons. It moisturizes without being greasy and helps heal. I won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best hand lotion I have ever had.  In the winter, my hands always looked scaly and rough around my fingernails ... but not with this lotion, and it works quickly.</li>
    <li> Works wonder on my overly dry skin.  I use it every day and can see a big difference</li>
    <li> Hands down (no pun intended) the best hand cream ever! I used it everyday for a week, and my hands were soft, smooth and hydrated. I even ordered a tube for my son who has very dry hands, and he saw the same result. The fragrance is clean and an added bonus the great result you will get with this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand cream I have found, having tried many many over the years. The sad thing is, the retail price on the Aveda website is $21. Nordstrom charges $21. Amazon lies and says that the retail is $29. I am becoming more and more disillusioned with Amazon&#x27;s false advertising, and higher than normal prices. I have made virtually hundreds of purchases from Amazon since they went into business. Only late, have they become unscrupulous in their pricing. If they are honest, they will at least publish this review. If not, I will publish it myself other websites.</li>
    <li> A friend who had just returned from a cruise recommended this to me. We both have sensitive skin. I Like it very much. Lots of botanicals and a light fragrance. Does not leave my hands greasy so that I leave handprints everywhere. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The best hand cream ever!</li>
    <li> Was in my hair salon today and tried the Aveda Hand Relief Lotion. I really liked it and I can still feel it on my hands many hours later. But when I come here to the Amazon site their pricing is higher than it is in the salon. So why is that I have to ask. So buyer beware do not buy from Amazon for it will be cheaper at your near by salon that carries Aveda products. Very disappointed in Amazon for that is faulty pricing!</li>
    <li> This hand cream is so good.  It is soothing and not greasy.  It smells nice and keeps my hands from going dry and cracking in the winter.</li>
    <li> I love this hand lotion! I use it several times a day at work in the winter and it has a light fragrance and a wonderful texture that immediately softens hands. Everyone likes different scents and some people don&#x27;t want a scent at all. To me, the scent in this one is light and seems spa-like, and applying it creates a moment of relaxation in the day. The lotion isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy, but moisturizing enough that one has to wipe off the excess before using a touch screen such as an iPhone or iPad. Not irritating to the skin. I gave some to a friend for Christmas and she likes it too.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion I feel it is better than average.  Service was great!</li>
    <li> I work in a field where you are always washing your hands. This works really well to keep the moisture in even after you have washed your hands several time during the day.</li>
    <li> I *almost* wish I had never tried this lotion because now I an&#x27;t go a day without it. I had been given trial size tubes in the past, and got hooked, but I wasn&#x27;t sure it was worth the cost for only 4oz. I&#x27;m so glad I convinced myself to go for it. I&#x27;m seriously obsessed.</li>
    <li> Great hand cream.  Arrived promptly.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I am a hairdresser and my hands are in water all day long. I have this by my bedside and apply it every night.</li>
    <li> this is best hand cream ever.  Absorbs and does a great job moisturizing and protecting.  I keep some at home and work</li>
    <li> I Love this Lotion! Smells wonderful and works great.  But you can get it from the Aveda website for $21.....</li>
    <li> Nice texture, not sticky or greasy, fast shipping.  The smell is slightly more lemon/citrus than the tube my friend had.  Hers smelled more earthy which I preferred.</li>
    <li> A little pricey, but worth it.  You only need a small amount for it to soak into your skin, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hands greasy.</li>
