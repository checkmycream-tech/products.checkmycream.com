      <li>I love, love, love the smell of this stuff.  </li>
      <li>This smells so good and is just a lot of fun to do.  </li>
      <li>This has been perfect for my skin that easily gets dried/irritated by scrubs because it instantly rehydrates.  </li>
      <li>Makes my skin incredibly smooth and smells like homemade jam :)</li>
      <li>It smells so good, I was salivating after applying the scrub on my face in a gentle, circular pattern.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does make the skin very nice and soft though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As a mask, it does a good job of leaving my skin very soft.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, I think this is a great occasional treat for your face.</li>
      <li>Free sample given, thank you.</li>
      <li>Have been using this product in Asia, it is great to get this pricing though it does take a LONG TIME since it is shipping from Korea.</li>
      <li>Fresh, treat for your face!  </li>
      <li>It smells great and isn&#x27;t too harsh.</li>
      <li>After leaving it on for about 15 minutes and washing it off, my skin felt so very wonderfully soft, smooth and velvety!</li>
      <li>It smells like fresh strawberries and does wonders for your skin.</li>
      <li>I bought my first jar at the skin food store at my local mall and fell in love it makes my face smell like strawberry jam and cleared up some mild acne</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d read a lot about how the Korean skincare industry has developed high quality and innovative products.</li>
      <li>You scrub it in until most of the granuals have dissolved and then let it sit for ten minutes before you wash it away.  </li>
      <li>First of all, this smells divine.</li>
      <li>Overall satisfied</li>
      <li>I love that this scrub is actually moisturizing!</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had pretty high expectations, but this isn&#x27;t worth the price if I was getting a scrub.</li>
      <li>I first tried it from a sample given to me from the Skin Food store at the mall and never thought much of it until I tried it.</li>
      <li>Like real food.</li>
      <li>also wait the whole 10-15 minutes after putting this on.</li>
      <li>well - it&#x27;s reasonably priced</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t really notice that it does anything at all to my skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like any facial scrub I use, nothing special.</li>
      <li>have super dry skin and super sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin - I can&#x27;t even use normal laundry detergent, but this product works very well for me and doesn&#x27;t make me break out at all.</li>
      <li>The seller also added 3 free samples of other Skin food products.</li>
      <li>I originally bought this mask because it had rave reviews from people with dry, sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The sugar granules will dissolve a little more, though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this Black Sugar Strawberry Mask when I came across a Skin Food store while traveling in Asia.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
      <li>Such a gentle scrub.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin super soft, though not quite as soft as the Skin Food Black Sugar Scrub.</li>
      <li>Additionally, you only need a tiny tiny amount (like a teaspoonful) for your entire face, so it&#x27;ll be sure to last a while!</li>
      <li>Whereas usually physical exfoliating masks are more irritating.</li>
      <li>After using the mask my skin felt softer and not dry.</li>
      <li>Nothing too bad, but a bit of that squeaky super clean feeling that I don&#x27;t like.</li>

    <li> This stuff is awesome! Like everyone says, DO NOT TASTE IT as tempting as it smells! Such a gentle scrub. If you want it to be even gentler, allow the scrub to sit for a moment on your wet face. The sugar granules will dissolve a little more, though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary. I love that this scrub is actually moisturizing! Afterwards I get a slight brightening and glowy face. It&#x27;s such a treat and I love that it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d read a lot about how the Korean skincare industry has developed high quality and innovative products. I was excited to try this Black Sugar Strawberry Mask when I came across a Skin Food store while traveling in Asia.  They recommended using this exfoliator once or twice a week.  It&#x27;s not too intense or harsh but I did feel that it left my skin feeling both radiant and reasonably hydrated; it didn&#x27;t leave my face leaving tight the way that the clay masks usually do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this Black Sugar Strawberry Mask regularly and feel that works well - it&#x27;s reasonably priced so I&#x27;m happy to make it a staple instead of splurge.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love the smell of this stuff.  It doesn&#x27;t break me out either but I don&#x27;t really notice that it does anything at all to my skin.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t get the hype for this product. It&#x27;s like any facial scrub I use, nothing special. The scent is really nice but I personally don&#x27;t like the stickiness of it that you have to leave on for 15 minutes. I&#x27;ve used it three times and I haven&#x27;t seen a big difference in skin condition other than being cleaner, but maybe it&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had pretty high expectations, but this isn&#x27;t worth the price if I was getting a scrub.</li>
    <li> The mask smells amazing and works well. After using the mask my skin felt softer and not dry. I will repurchase from this seller once I run out of this mask. It will last a long time considering I will use it once a week. Seller (cosmetic*shop) shipped within two days of ordering and arrived earlier than expected (Amount of days to arrive after placing order &#x3D; 12 days). The seller also added 3 free samples of other Skin food products.</li>
    <li> YES. This mask smells so scrumptious (but don&#x27;t eat it-yukh!)! It leaves my skin feeling soft. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells so good I want to eat it. Leaves skin super soft, though not quite as soft as the Skin Food Black Sugar Scrub. That one&#x27;s still my fav.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, just like strawberry preserves. Also works great as an exfoliant, and makes my skin baby smooth every time. The sugar may seem a bit harsh or grating for some, but applying on moist skin helps dissolve the sugar and make it gentler. Additionally, you only need a tiny tiny amount (like a teaspoonful) for your entire face, so it&#x27;ll be sure to last a while!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this mask because it had rave reviews from people with dry, sensitive skin. Whereas usually physical exfoliating masks are more irritating. First of all, this smells divine. Truly. Like real food. And looks like it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super dry skin and super sensitive skin. This mask does not irritate my skin, BUT it does dry it out a tad. Nothing too bad, but a bit of that squeaky super clean feeling that I don&#x27;t like. However, if I use a good moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wait the whole 10-15 minutes after putting this on.

    <li> I love this stuff! It smells great and isn&#x27;t too harsh.</li>
    <li> I bought my first jar at the skin food store at my local mall and fell in love it makes my face smell like strawberry jam and cleared up some mild acne</li>
    <li> Fresh, treat for your face!  I use this two, three times a week and my face us softer and smoother. Wish you got more product.</li>
    <li> It smells so good, I was salivating after applying the scrub on my face in a gentle, circular pattern. After leaving it on for about 15 minutes and washing it off, my skin felt so very wonderfully soft, smooth and velvety! I love, love, love this mask and am so glad I got it. I first tried it from a sample given to me from the Skin Food store at the mall and never thought much of it until I tried it. Give this a try definitely!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and works great too. I love SkinFood brand products already, and this one I will re buy. It smells like fresh strawberries and does wonders for your skin. I recommend wetting your face, then using this for about a minute or two, then leaving it on for 5 minutes. Your body heat will kind of melt the product into your skin and when you wash off your face will feel amazing!</li>
    <li> Really great Mask wash off. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Received after 2 weeks, some leakage as i can smell the strawberry scent. Free sample given, thank you. Overall satisfied</li>
    <li> Have been using this product in Asia, it is great to get this pricing though it does take a LONG TIME since it is shipping from Korea.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing!  It&#x27;s like strawberry jam.  As a mask, it does a good job of leaving my skin very soft.  The only issue with this product are the strawberry seeds which are supposed to act like an exfoliating agent.  They can be a little rough or jagged on your skin so I would lean towards less frequent use with this product as an exfoliater.  Otherwise, I think this is a great occasional treat for your face.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> This smells so good and is just a lot of fun to do.  Will repurchase this product for sure.</li>
    <li> So good !!! Feel clean and brighter!!!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin incredibly smooth and smells like homemade jam :)</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin - I can&#x27;t even use normal laundry detergent, but this product works very well for me and doesn&#x27;t make me break out at all. My skin feels so smooth and looks great using this twice a week after using a cleanser. This product smells amazing too. Definitely recommend this product!</li>

This has been perfect for my skin that easily gets dried/irritated by scrubs because it instantly rehydrates.  I also love the smell and my face is noticeably smoother afterwards.
