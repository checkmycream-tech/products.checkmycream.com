      <li>Just what I needed, a brush stand that doesn&#x27;t cost too much more than my brush.</li>
      <li>It holds my brush competently.</li>
      <li>but I was expecting more.</li>
      <li>The brush stand might be okay for a travel item.</li>
      <li>Easy to fit in a travel bag.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean off any residual shaving soap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great stand for equally inexpensive shaving brushes.</li>
      <li>It was cheap and is cheap.</li>
      <li>so it won&#x27;t hang freely.</li>
      <li>course there are better quality ones available, at a higher price, and probably worth it, too.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
      <li>This is a great little stand, it does the job</li>
      <li>It is cheap, easily replaceable and helps keep my brush dry.  </li>
      <li>The only thing a brush stand is for is to make sure your brush drys with the bristles facing downward.</li>
      <li>so just want to make you aware.  </li>
      <li>It may seem flimsy at first, but don&#x27;t be fooled.  </li>

      <li>Works for a Semogue 2015 (loose fit) and a Semogue 1305 (snug fit).</li>
      <li>Unless you absolutely need to see chrome or are just simply wanting to spend way more money that you need to on a freaking shaving brush, then this is all you need.</li>
      <li>Really a usable item</li>
      <li>the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works very well with my Escali Badger Brush ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WR3QSG/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_img_sol_1 )</li>
      <li>cant really complain too much.</li>
      <li>For the price, somewhat expected, but the net margin on these things must be amazing.</li>
      <li>Got to be careful with the acrylic stand so as not to break the top by trying to push the brush in too far.</li>
      <li>The price of this stand is really what drew me to it, but I was also pleasantly surprised at how compact it is as well.  </li>
      <li>Since someone purchasing this product is probably a new brush user like myself</li>
      <li>but, it is not a snug or tight fit.  </li>
      <li>This little stand is very short and the brush must be inserted at the bristles and not at the top of the handle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised a company specializing in shaving needs would sell a stand this size.</li>
      <li>How small it is is really good for me because I don&#x27;t have much space in the bathroom (small sink).  </li>
      <li>but it was a clear not black as shown in picture, would recommend this to anyone needing a stand.</li>
      <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t think that it would be big enough to hold my brush, but it fits with a little extra space too.  </li>
      <li>But to be clear, it holds the brush and has enough clearance for it to dry.  </li>

<li> It seems like the Col. Conk company must purchase these in bulk from  some other company and just put it in a box with their logo on a sticker on the box.</li>
<li> Not worth the $6 I paid for it.</li>
<li> The water stays down in the brushs and builds up a bacteria.</li>
<li> When you hang it upside down, the water runs out and down the the point of the brissle and drips off.</li>
<li> Even getting the bristles into the stand is a tight squeeze.</li>
<li> I would not recommend the stand for everyday home use.</li>
<li> Too small!</li>
<li> Nothing really wrong with it, but it was very narrow and did not fit my Whipped Dog brush from Larry Andreassen.</li>
<li> Stable base, solid plastic construction and fits a variety of brush handles.  </li>

    <li> I chose this stand because it is acrylic. Easy to clean off any residual shaving soap. It&#x27;s sturdy enough for the brush, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it if it falls on the floor.</li>
    <li> The price of this stand is really what drew me to it, but I was also pleasantly surprised at how compact it is as well.  At first, I didn&#x27;t think that it would be big enough to hold my brush, but it fits with a little extra space too.  How small it is is really good for me because I don&#x27;t have much space in the bathroom (small sink).  It&#x27;s a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Hi! I&#x27;m surprised a company specializing in shaving needs would sell a stand this size. Too small! I can us it by hanging brush at top of bristles. I can not get the handle of shaving brush into this stand at all. Even getting the bristles into the stand is a tight squeeze. Got to be careful with the acrylic stand so as not to break the top by trying to push the brush in too far. My shaving brush is a standard size. The brush stand might be okay for a travel item. Easy to fit in a travel bag. I would not recommend the stand for everyday home use. On the plus side this stand cost $8. Cheapest shaving brush stand I could find.</li>
    <li> This is a great little stand, it does the job well. The only issue is that a bristle or 2 will go in any direction but down because the stand holds the brush from the base of the bristles and not the handle, but other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> 5 stars because it does what it is intended for.  It is cheap, easily replaceable and helps keep my brush dry.  What else do you need?</li>
    <li> Measurements don&#x27;t match the actual size when received. Does not fit standard brushes as stated. You could truy to hang it off the the lower &amp;#34;bulge&amp;#34; part of the brush but it would be very loose and would often be lopsided. It would also push part of the brush against the back part of the stand so it won&#x27;t hang freely. The Col. Conk logo is not even on it. It seems like the Col. Conk company must purchase these in bulk from  some other company and just put it in a box with their logo on a sticker on the box. Not worth the $6 I paid for it.</li>
    <li> It was cheap and is cheap. It does not play well with my shower caddy but it has it uses. I just put my brush in the soap cup.</li>
    <li> This inexpensive shaving brush stand is a very good value and does the job it&#x27;s designed to do.&lt;br /&gt;Of course there are better quality ones available, at a higher price, and probably worth it, too.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect more for the money than you should and this stand will be a good value for you as well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m planning to use this as a travel stand after my eventual purchase of a higher price/quality one.</li>
    <li> Unless you absolutely need to see chrome or are just simply wanting to spend way more money that you need to on a freaking shaving brush, then this is all you need. The only thing a brush stand is for is to make sure your brush drys with the bristles facing downward.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. I found out why so many brushs goe&#x27;s bad. When you set them on the handle you hold to lather up the soap. The water stays down in the brushs and builds up a bacteria. Then they eat at the brissel. When you hang it upside down, the water runs out and down the the point of the brissle and drips off. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> It holds both my Escali badger and Omega Blonde boar brush well. Minus 1 star for not actually having the Colonel Conk&#x27;s logo printed on it as pictured in item description. The stand came in a box, sealed with a Col. Conk&#x27;s label, but the stand is just a generic black stand.</li>
    <li> Nothing really wrong with it, but it was very narrow and did not fit my Whipped Dog brush from Larry Andreassen.</li>
    <li> It holds the brush after you shave. You put the bristles in from the side and it&#x27;ll hold just about any brush, whats not to like it does its job</li>
    <li> Product sturdy enough to hold my brush but it was a clear not black as shown in picture, would recommend this to anyone needing a stand.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot, so I wanted something compact and functional I could pack with my toiletries. This just does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works very well with my Escali Badger Brush ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WR3QSG/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_img_sol_1 )</li>
    <li> I rate this as 4 stars because it does what it is described to do but, it is not a snug or tight fit.  Since someone purchasing this product is probably a new brush user like myself so just want to make you aware.  But to be clear, it holds the brush and has enough clearance for it to dry.  If it was knocked, the brush could fall out.  I would buy this again as maybe all universal holders are like this but I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
    <li> works great, holds my brush just fine cant really complain too much. Does exactly what it is suppose to do.</li>
    <li> This little stand is very short and the brush must be inserted at the bristles and not at the top of the handle. It is just too short. Really a usable item but I was expecting more. It would have been helpful if the height of the holder had been mentioned. Knowing the dimensions, I would not have purchased.</li>
    <li> It may seem flimsy at first, but don&#x27;t be fooled.  It stands straight and holds the brush firmly with no problems at all.  Excellent value for the price.</li>
    <li> Works for a Semogue 2015 (loose fit) and a Semogue 1305 (snug fit).</li>
    <li> It fits my brush. I have a Marvy shaving brush. Just what I needed, a brush stand that doesn&#x27;t cost too much more than my brush.</li>
    <li> Stand is nice and compact, does not take up a lot of room on sink. The color matches the brush nicely.</li>
    <li> Eh, overpriced, but what are you going to do?</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing fancy about the Colonel Conk stand, but it works just as advertised.  Stable base, solid plastic construction and fits a variety of brush handles.  It&#x27;s a great stand for equally inexpensive shaving brushes.</li>
    <li> It holds my brush competently. A Tweezerman cheapo from Amazon as well. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G647Y8/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s00_i01?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will not win any awards for fit and finish, and weighs next to nothing. For the price, somewhat expected, but the net margin on these things must be amazing.</li>
