      <li>This is a great product/&lt;br /&gt;Fresh fragrance/ very morturizing!&lt;br /&gt;Great for a dry climate too!</li>
      <li>I BELIEVE IT&#x27;S THE BEST KEPT SECRET AROUND,</li>
      <li>Great product, not oily at all, I do recommend it highly for dry</li>
      <li>Just the right size for your purse or car.</li>
      <li>Had purchased a bigger bottle of this last year and really liked the smell, so was glad to find a purse size.</li>
      <li>YOU THINK IT&#x27;S GOOD FOR AN AVERAGE PERSON?</li>
      <li>I am very very fussy about my hand cream.  </li>
      <li>In addition, I found the moisture retention to be comparable to Eucerin&#x27;s hand cream, but the cost was considerably higher.  </li>
      <li>This is an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;However, it was too expensive</li>
      <li>Use for super soft silky (immediately effect!)</li>
      <li>If you use it daily, other people don&#x27;t want to stop touching your hands..:)</li>
      <li>Otherwise buy the large size and save some money.  </li>
      <li>This hand cream really works , I am a fan of it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really helps to feel your hand treated like real lady&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and really like it.  </li>
      <li>Really help dry hands and easy to carry in purse</li>
      <li>Next time I will get the bigger tube since I love the smell so much.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I think this small size is good only for people who do not know the product, so they can try it out.  </li>
      <li>Was looking for a lotion for my purse that was a nice thick lotion.  </li>
      <li>it is so good for dry hands esp if you garden a lot..or in my case..use clay, break down boxes and garden!</li>
      <li>nothing particularly offensive, just a little...stale smelling (&amp; I&#x27;ve never been one to be sensitive to product scent).  </li>
      <li>Moisturizes extremely well and absorbs into the skin quickly without being too oily.</li>
      <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>I bought it for my whole family and some friends with the same problem.</li>
      <li>Your hands will feel immediately soft and supple.</li>
      <li>Non greasy and makes your hands wonderfully soft.</li>
      <li>During the gardening season months later my hands too a real beating and nothing I tried worked.</li>
      <li>I should have gone directly to the Crabtree and Evelyn site.  </li>
      <li>Between this off-putting scent, marginal moisturization, &amp; high cost, this cream was a definite miss.  </li>
      <li>A few times I&#x27;ve applied it during meetings and people next to me complimented me on the smell (though it is not so strong that it would overwhelm the room).</li>
      <li>Arrived as promised and exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>but the tube looks pretty rough</li>
      <li>Have used this product for years and like the new smaller size for my purse.  </li>
      <li>Not greasy, makes your hands feel soft even in the middle of winter.</li>
      <li>This is a very small tube, so I&#x27;m going through it quickly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;However, it was too expensive&lt;br /&gt;For me to reorder. I&#x27;ll have to&lt;br /&gt;Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised and exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I should have gone directly to the Crabtree and Evelyn site.  I found this same product there later for only $8.00.  This is far lower of a price than I paid for such a small size.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Just the right size for your purse or car. Has the most amazing clean, fresh smell. Great price too.</li>
    <li> Had purchased a bigger bottle of this last year and really liked the smell, so was glad to find a purse size.</li>
    <li> The best care for hands, even if you only enjoy gardens and don&#x27;t work in them. A sales girl at a store in Auburn, CA recommended this for dry hands. When I was running out of the tube I got there, I was so happy to find it on Amazon! It was packed carefully and arrived in great shape. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand cream around. GREAT in the winter but good all year. I can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> It does provide great soothing moisturizing, but the smell is overpowering for me.</li>
    <li> BEST hand cream ever.. I have always had chapped dry bleeding hands in the winter. I am a potter with my hands constantly in clay and soap and water. It has been a mess until a friend gave this to me as a gift. I will never be without it. I bought it for my whole family and some friends with the same problem. Great stuff. Non greasy and makes your hands wonderfully soft.</li>
    <li> I buy this regularly for my wife, who has serious problems with skin cracking on her fingers, especially in cold weather. This is her day-to-day go-to favorite. Nothing else works quite so well for her.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s expensive but a little goes a long way. Really everything the good reviews say. Now a daily good habit. Bought some for family members who have skin issues on their hands.</li>
    <li> A must to keep on you at all times. This hand cream really works , I am a fan of it.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest lotion in the world.</li>
    <li> Great product, not oily at all, I do recommend it highly for dry hands.&lt;br /&gt;The scent could be better but the texture is fine.</li>
    <li> As a stay at home mom, I wash my hands countless times a day, and was looking for something that would not only provide deep moisture, but also retain that moisture after several handwashings.  I decided to try this cream after so many rave reviews.  Initially, I was put off  by the scent;  nothing particularly offensive, just a little...stale smelling (&amp; I&#x27;ve never been one to be sensitive to product scent).  In addition, I found the moisture retention to be comparable to Eucerin&#x27;s hand cream, but the cost was considerably higher.  Between this off-putting scent, marginal moisturization, &amp; high cost, this cream was a definite miss.  Doesn&#x27;t measure up against my holy grail hand cream, Glysomed.  Sorry Crabtree, no-go for me.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful hand cream!  I first received it as a gift then sought out the purse size because I needed to carry it with me all the time!</li>
    <li> Use this at my sisters house and had to have my own for travel! Not greasy, makes your hands feel soft even in the middle of winter.</li>
    <li> This is a great product/&lt;br /&gt;Fresh fragrance/ very morturizing!&lt;br /&gt;Great for a dry climate too!</li>
    <li> Was looking for a lotion for my purse that was a nice thick lotion.  This lotion is amazing, so smooth and creamy and absorbs nicely.  The one-star reduction is due to to lotion tube.  I would prefer if it were plastic but its metal and malleable and I&#x27;m worried that it&#x27;s going to tear in my purse.  So far it hasn&#x27;t but the tube looks pretty rough and I don&#x27;t doubt that it could happen.</li>
    <li> Nice sized grab and go hand lotion.  The product is amazing!!  It truly is.  Your hands will feel immediately soft and supple.</li>
    <li> the BEST hand repair lotion I have ever used.  I use it several times a day for non&#x3D;greasy, pleasant smelling hand protection.  Leave a glycerin like feeling.</li>
    <li> Good flavor.&lt;br /&gt;It is moist.</li>
    <li> It is expensive, yet not good, waste money.</li>
    <li> Very pleasant earthy smell! A few times I&#x27;ve applied it during meetings and people next to me complimented me on the smell (though it is not so strong that it would overwhelm the room). Moisturizes extremely well and absorbs into the skin quickly without being too oily. This is a very small tube, so I&#x27;m going through it quickly. Next time I will get the bigger tube since I love the smell so much.</li>
    <li> If you have dry cracked fingers then buy this cream!</li>
    <li> I sent this size as a gift, and my friend loves it.  I think this small size is good only for people who do not know the product, so they can try it out.  Otherwise buy the large size and save some money.  I adore the product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hand cream. It absorbs immediately and is never greasy. The product size was perfect for stocking stuffers</li>
    <li> I am very very fussy about my hand cream.  I want it to soak in and work and not leave a feeling on my skin...  not any kind of feeling.  That&#x27;s what this cream does.  AND it smells wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Best if used overnight! Not practical for use during the day as will make hands slippery! Affect lasts for 1-2 days of one treatment. If you use it daily, other people don&#x27;t want to stop touching your hands..:)</li>
    <li> Good for dry skin.  Nice fragrance too.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Really help dry hands and easy to carry in purse</li>
    <li> This wonderful hand cream for a man.  It has little fragrance and is worderful for dry skin on just about anywhere, partcilarly hands, elbows, heals, feet.  My wife gave me three tubes for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Smells good but not girlie. Perfect for the winter months. Why do I have to write so many words to post this review? it&#x27;s hand cream.</li>
    <li> Works great great gift</li>
    <li> Very expensive for the small amount.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and really like it.  The only down side is that it is a bit expensive; so I am treating myself every time I buy a refill when I run out.  I like the odor of the product and since I have allergies to most scents this is important.  I carry the tube in my purse, so this size is great.</li>
    <li> I love this creme.  It is the only one that I&#x27;ve found that helps my hands when they are in really bad condition</li>
    <li> Great lotion, perfect size for your purse.</li>
    <li> I always have in my purse cause it&#x27;s really helps to feel your hand treated like real lady&#x27;s.  Love it!</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY, THE BEST STUFF ON THE MARKET THAT NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT. I BELIEVE IT&#x27;S THE BEST KEPT SECRET AROUND, OF COURSE I HIDE MY OWN!!!  I NEVER SHARE IT, UNLESS IT&#x27;S A VERY GOOD FRIEND AT WORK AND SUCH..IT&#x27;S JUST THAT GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COME ON PEOPLE, IF IT&#x27;S GOOD FOR A GARDENER DON&#x27;T YOU THINK IT&#x27;S GOOD FOR AN AVERAGE PERSON? I USED IT ON MY FACE, HANDS, EVERYWHERE!  AND SMELLS DIVINE...JUST SAYIN&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I hope they always make this stuff..it is so good for dry hands esp if you garden a lot..or in my case..use clay, break down boxes and garden! Smells delightly and not too overpowering. Kind of like rosemary. Use for super soft silky (immediately effect!) hands and to heal! &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> good cream good perfume</li>
    <li> My wife just loves this and cream! Shesays that nothing works as good as Gardeners Hand Therapy to smooth the rought spots after working with her hands.</li>
    <li> An outstanding product, good for my winter-cracked fingers.</li>
    <li> This was given to me by a coworker and I stuck it in my drawer w/o trying it. During the gardening season months later my hands too a real beating and nothing I tried worked. I pull out my GT tube and it was like magic! I love the new scent as well. The rosemary is strong but I love it. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and like the new smaller size for my purse.  It stays with my hands and keeps them smooth and smelling great!!</li>
