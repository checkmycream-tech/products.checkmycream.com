      <li>I love this moisturizer!</li>
      <li>This is a very good product and worth buying and using.</li>
      <li>Our dermatologist recommended this product specifically because it is an effective, light-weight moisturizer with 50+ SPF.</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s better.</li>
      <li>The best &amp; lightest sun protection cream i&#x27;v used in my entire life.</li>
      <li>I love Neutrogena&#x27;s Visibly Even SPF 30 with Helioplex, so I thought I&#x27;d try another Helioplex product.</li>
      <li>I am sure it will do the job for me</li>
      <li>I use it as a moisturizer and love the softness and deweyness of it under my light foundation because I&#x27;m 53 years old and dewey is what looks best.  </li>
      <li>For my everyday use this product works wonderfully.</li>
      <li>My face feels smooth all day</li>
      <li>It goes on great, not greasy, doesn&#x27;t leave your face with that white tint, doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes, not heavy, doesn&#x27;t clog your pores and it has helioplex which is good for your skin.</li>
      <li>It goes on well under makeup and is nongreasy, but smooth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s scentless and moisturizes, but it does not leave a thick layer on your face, nd it doesnt have a tint either.    :D</li>
      <li>I love the healthy defense daily moisturizer in the winter because it is light and creamy</li>
      <li>and this is light and just the right amount of spf.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly without feeling greasy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m usually not one to use face products but this one is very light and soaks right in.</li>
      <li>Product goes on skin and dries like a regular light lotion which I love.</li>
      <li>since I do peels on my face, and I read all the reviews on this one and believe me, they&#x27;re right.</li>
      <li>So if you suffer from sensitive skin stick with your current product as this one isn&#x27;t any good for you.  </li>
      <li>I use it every single day with or without make up and both work nicely.</li>
      <li>Neutrogena Daily Moisturizer is very light  on the face.</li>
      <li>I still have this cabinet to use as backup when I run out of the higher SPF.</li>
      <li>Even if you don&#x27;t have crevices, a dewey look is youthful than a powdered look.[[ASIN:B0037LMKF2 Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer SPF 50 with Helioplex 1.7 oz (50 g)]]  </li>
      <li>That was the Line that needed reformulation with a bit higher SPF.</li>
      <li>As I talk with friends I found this is an extremely reasonable price for a moisturizer/sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use this on my neck, however, only on my face, and I cover it with a light dusting of mineral face powder with SPF 20.</li>
      <li>Due to having sensitive skin and medical skin conditions, I have been going to an exceptional dermatologist for years.  </li>
      <li>I am at high risk for skin cancer (have already had some Mohs surgery on my face), so I take all the precautions I can.</li>
      <li>SPF 55 is a little stronger, but I use it in the spring and summer for more protection; even though I avoid the sun like a vampire.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that it smells more like suntan lotion than a moisturizer, but hey, less fragrance chemicals for your skin, so that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
      <li>Today is my third day with  one side of my face having a huge red splotch from this cream.  </li>
      <li>I also add a few drops on the top of my cheekbone every day because it adds a soft sheerness that I have never found in any make-up products.</li>
      <li>skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been looking for a higher SPF since I&#x27;ve recently begun using low-level glycolic acid peels on my face.</li>
      <li>Price is a little high, but it&#x27;s worth it for what the product does!</li>
      <li>This is not the cream for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I want to keep my skin at 53 years old protected against skin cancer and youthful.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist noticed that the left side of my face is darker than my right side, probably because of the UV rays my left side gets while I&#x27;m driving.  </li>
      <li>I bought the exact same item at my local supermarket (HEB if your in TX) today for $13.77.</li>
      <li>I live in Florida and use this on my face as my daily moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 60+ guy with dry facial skin and have tried various products with varying success.</li>
      <li>You barely feel it.</li>
      <li>This totally blocks the sun, and keeps my skin soft, moist, and unwrinkled.</li>
      <li>It was my fault in not researching further as to how it affects sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for a dry sensitive skin product, I use Aveeno.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Due to having sensitive skin and medical skin conditions, I have been going to an exceptional dermatologist for years.  I want to share this information with you because it comes from a dr. who has expertise.  Neutragena with helioplex is the ONLY sunblock he ever recommended to me because it blocks out the UVB? rays and doesn&#x27;t break down in one hour.  I get confused with the UVA and UVB rays.  Furthermore, the sunblock they put in your foundation, moisturizer, etc....wears away after one hour. The result; you and your face have absolutely NO protection against the sun.  Neutrogena with Helioplex is the only sun protection I need.   I love the healthy defense daily moisturizer in the winter because it is light and creamy and I KNOW I am getting the protection.  I use it as a moisturizer and love the softness and deweyness of it under my light foundation because I&#x27;m 53 years old and dewey is what looks best.  P.S. If you&#x27;re in your 40&#x27;s it is time to stop wearing powder over your foundation which will creep into crevices. Even if you don&#x27;t have crevices, a dewey look is youthful than a powdered look.[[ASIN:B0037LMKF2 Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer SPF 50 with Helioplex 1.7 oz (50 g)]]  The Ultra Sheer dry touch sunblock (Neutrogena with helioplex) SPF 55 is a little stronger, but I use it in the spring and summer for more protection; even though I avoid the sun like a vampire. I also add a few drops on the top of my cheekbone every day because it adds a soft sheerness that I have never found in any make-up products. My sister loves the SPF 70 and I find it&#x27;s cakey and white. (However, I will use it if I know that I&#x27;m going to be somewhere where the brutal summer sun will hit my face.)  But, Neutrogena needs to be purchased with the HELIOPLEX to work and it doesn&#x27;t break down in one hour.  I want to keep my skin at 53 years old protected against skin cancer and youthful. I hope this provides information that will help people understand about SPF.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sheer,lightweight,fast absorbing,unscented, non greasy but moisturizing,with helioplex in it.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;small tube only 1.7 oz., comparatively too expensive at $16.26 and only SPF50.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer Neutrogena Sport Face Sunblock lotion SPF70 2.5 oz.for $9.92.</li>
    <li> This works well but it very pricey for a very small amount.</li>
    <li> I scoured Amazon trying to find the best sunscreen since I do peels on my face, and I read all the reviews on this one and believe me, they&#x27;re right. It goes on great, not greasy, doesn&#x27;t leave your face with that white tint, doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes, not heavy, doesn&#x27;t clog your pores and it has helioplex which is good for your skin. . I love this I&#x27;m hooked and it will be the one and only sunscreen I use from here on. .</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this for me and I wear it every day. It goes on well under makeup and is nongreasy, but smooth.</li>
    <li> The best &amp; lightest sun protection cream i&#x27;v used in my entire life.</li>
    <li> I need to keep uvb,uv rays off my face product does the job.I use this product to protect skin from cancer</li>
    <li> It seemed like a good modturizer. I just began using it. I am sure it will do the job for me</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! I have very fair skin and this is light and just the right amount of spf. I use it every single day with or without make up and both work nicely. My face feels smooth all day and I don&#x27;t get sunburned or anything (which I am prone to). Very wonderful product and have been using this for about a year now and counting. Price is a little high, but it&#x27;s worth it for what the product does! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Doctor recommended. I&#x27;m usually not one to use face products but this one is very light and soaks right in. SPF 50 is the only way to go. As I talk with friends I found this is an extremely reasonable price for a moisturizer/sunscreen.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist noticed that the left side of my face is darker than my right side, probably because of the UV rays my left side gets while I&#x27;m driving.  Even though I was using a moisturizer with SPF, she said that the number was too low, and recommended this.  It has SPF 50, so it&#x27;ll block those aging, damaging rays.  I have no idea what helioplex is, but it sounds all scientific-y.  It&#x27;s inexpensive for a really good moisturizer. It absorbs quickly without feeling greasy.  Neutrogena is a quality brand.  My only complaint is that it smells more like suntan lotion than a moisturizer, but hey, less fragrance chemicals for your skin, so that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
    <li> Great product for my skin. I recommend it to my friends!</li>
    <li> I live in Florida and use this on my face as my daily moisturizer. I am at high risk for skin cancer (have already had some Mohs surgery on my face), so I take all the precautions I can. I don&#x27;t use this on my neck, however, only on my face, and I cover it with a light dusting of mineral face powder with SPF 20. This totally blocks the sun, and keeps my skin soft, moist, and unwrinkled. My dermatologist approves.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product and worth buying and using. After purchasing this, my doctor informed me that I need to wear the highest SPF and so I bought the Neutrogena 110. I still have this cabinet to use as backup when I run out of the higher SPF. Neutrogena Daily Moisturizer is very light  on the face. You barely feel it. It does not leave white streaks.</li>
    <li> I had used Cetaphil SPF 50 moisturizer before, but it left likea  white tinted thick greasy and shiny layer on my face.    THis does not! ALso it&#x27;s helioplex so it&#x27;s better. It&#x27;s scentless and moisturizes, but it does not leave a thick layer on your face, nd it doesnt have a tint either.    :D</li>
    <li> This is really good stuff, but the price ($17) is terrible.  I bought the exact same item at my local supermarket (HEB if your in TX) today for $13.77.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I&#x27;m very fair and freckley and I use this every day (rain or shine) under my makeup. I have oily skin and it has never made me break out. I use it on my neck and chest too...gotta keep those wrinkles away! 😉</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 60+ guy with dry facial skin and have tried various products with varying success. This includes stuff I&#x27;ve bought as well as the premium products my wife likes. Our dermatologist recommended this product specifically because it is an effective, light-weight moisturizer with 50+ SPF. It is formulated for daly use and a little goes a long way.. We both like it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I found this cream on livingstrong.com as being rated second for dry skin types.  It was my fault in not researching further as to how it affects sensitive skin.  This is not the cream for sensitive skin.  Today is my third day with  one side of my face having a huge red splotch from this cream.  To look at it you&#x27;d say I&#x27;ve sunburned or windburned one side of my face.  So if you suffer from sensitive skin stick with your current product as this one isn&#x27;t any good for you.  If you are looking for a dry sensitive skin product, I use Aveeno.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this for years and just loves how well it works.  And if gives a good protection from the sun without any greasy feel.</li>
    <li> I miss the Ageless Essentials product. That was the Line that needed reformulation with a bit higher SPF. I suspect that is why it disappeared from the shelves.</li>
    <li> I work in an office so I do not have all day constant sun exposure except for break and lunch walks. For my everyday use this product works wonderfully. Product goes on skin and dries like a regular light lotion which I love. I have an oily T zone, so a common problem that I have with other sun screens is they become white and streak down my face but this one stays put on my face longer without streaking. It does well under makeup. But when I was at a concert in all day sun I still got sunburn on my shoulders even though I was reapplying every couple of hours.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at my local drug store and after 4 days of use I woke up this morning to severe chemical burns on my face. My eyes were swollen shut and I have red blotches all over. My skin is also peeling off. Best part? I&#x27;m 1,000 miles away from home representing my company at a trade show and I look like a monster. DO NOT BUY THIS STUFF.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product in SPF 30 and in S PF50.The SPF 30 I use when I am n doors and no sun,theSpf 50 is for lots of sun.goes on the skin great.I lve both.  dj</li>
    <li> I second other reviewers who say that this product is NOT for sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been looking for a higher SPF since I&#x27;ve recently begun using low-level glycolic acid peels on my face. I love Neutrogena&#x27;s Visibly Even SPF 30 with Helioplex, so I thought I&#x27;d try another Helioplex product. Goodness, this SPF 50 lotion stung like the dickens and reddened my face. It&#x27;s also got a heavier/greasier texture that I don&#x27;t care for.  I&#x27;ll finish this tube for hand and body protection, but will not be buying another.</li>
    <li> I am serious about protecting my skin from the sun, so I use this 365 days a year.  The price is right and the performance is perfect.</li>
