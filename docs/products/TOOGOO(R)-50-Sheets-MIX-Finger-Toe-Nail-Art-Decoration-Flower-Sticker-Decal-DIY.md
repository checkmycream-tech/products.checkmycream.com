      <li>These stickers are nice and thin, so they adhere better and last longer, but you do need to be gentle when removing them from the backing or they will tear.  </li>

    <li> Product received as expected</li>
    <li> Almost all of these were either Angry Birds and moustaches. There were a few flowers. These are ugly and stupid and I wish I had not purchased them. There also were no metallics in all the sheets.</li>
    <li> they dont last long but i love them just for one day,</li>
    <li> very nice stickers! remove them with a tweezer and place on your nail with the tweezer. As long as you cover with clear polish they will last a week or longer.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than I realized.</li>
    <li> Stickers stick well to the nail, but designs lack bright colors, and are not good quality.</li>
    <li> Nice selection of stickers took awhile to get here though. But it is a nice selection. None the less. Thanks</li>

    <li> Still waiting for them too arrive. But I have uses similar nail art they only work well when you have too be creative and have a complete look for the nail art design I like your product best because of the different sizes and angle cuts which allow me too create seamless flowing nail art designs.</li>
    <li> These are top of the line,including color and texture and they stay on every good.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t stick well some of them</li>
    <li> My girls can&#x27;t wait to put them on their nails; such a variety and oh so cute. Thanks for a quality product at a low price. Don&#x27;t forget to apply clear polish over the top of the design.</li>
    <li> The only problem I have with these is that they tear apart easily when you are trying to get them off the paper.  Other than that, I love the selection and look.</li>
    <li> After finding 50 sheets of nail stickers for only 5 dollars, I decided to buy it, considering that I usuallly buy them from walmart for 1.50 per sheet. They took a while to get here, but I decided it was definetly worth it. When I finallly received them in the mail, I noticed they smelled a bit &amp;#34;odd&amp;#34;. I received 25 white nail stickers in designs like butterflies, and hearts, and 25 orange, green, yellow, purple, and pink ones, all of which were flowers. I did not receive any black nail stickers as pictured, which I was really looking forward too. Overall I think these are a great buy!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The stickers are gorgeous! The shipping was faster than stated and than I expected. I did and would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I liked this product , except , received only 49 counts of sheets than 50.&lt;br /&gt;But what I receive is nice so not thinking to return but I would be more happy if I would have receive for what i did pay.</li>
    <li> I received this long before it was suppose to come which is always a great thing. Everything was in tact and I can&#x27;t wait to start using them on my nails. I would defiantly buy them again and recommend them too.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy them!!!!!! Not worth it at all!!! It has a lot but they all rip when talking them out. I wish I would have listed to the reviews I read😔😭😑🔫</li>
    <li> I have now purchased this set THREE times.  First order had qty of one.  Second and third order Qty of two.  It&#x27;s very easy to use these two stickers, and super addicting.  If I&#x27;m not doing nail art with polish, I grab these to polish off my &amp;#34;look&amp;#34;.  (No pun intended there!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget to use topcoat over decorations, to help keep them last longer.</li>
    <li> Super cute designs.  Great quality, perfect for me and the girls mani/pedi Sundays.  These stickers are nice and thin, so they adhere better and last longer, but you do need to be gentle when removing them from the backing or they will tear.  Can beat the quality or price!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t use them yet but very pretty!</li>
    <li> I bought these and there is quite an assortment.  There are a lot of decals for the price.  Had an issue but the company&lt;br /&gt;came through very fast and I was very pleased. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> great option with lots of varieties</li>
    <li> Works great with great price with variety of choices</li>
    <li> love them i wish i could put pictures up but im not on my computer, many many many different stickers all sheets are different! great and cheap buy &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I like it. just have some bad smell...I hope the smell will go away soon.</li>
    <li> My 4 year old loves these, and they last for a long time considering her age.  You have to put them on with tweezers, but they stay on well (unless she&#x27;s digging in the dirt outside)!</li>
    <li> Granddaughters are going to love these. So many designs to choose from. Can&#x27;t wait to give to see their faces when they get them</li>
    <li> Love it! Lots of different designs for super inexpensive. For the price of one sheet, you get 50 quality sheets. I had to wait a little bit for it but it was definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> They are great definitely a good buy!!</li>
    <li> The stickers holdup well on the nail and have a low profile. They are just as advertised and add beautiful detail to your nails.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these so much, I ordered more. They&#x27;re so easy to apply, look GREAT &amp; stay put. I needed to move some of them more than once before I was able to permanently place them. THEY DID NOT TEAR NOR FALL APART. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ;-) ;-) ♡</li>
    <li> Love them.&lt;br /&gt;Gave most of them to friends so I had to order one more time :)</li>
    <li> These stickers are not very well made for nail use. The raised areas break apart as you remove them from the sheet and the ones you are able to apply come off in 24hrs.</li>
    <li> I love these stickers. They are thinner so you have to gently remove them. But they stick great to my nails with a top coat. They are a nice size for my nails. My nails are slightly on the smaller size. But a great find. They do smell like plastic but once they are laid out it goes away. Very happy</li>
    <li> Received these today and I absolutely love them!!! The price was great and the quality is fantastic. Thank you!!! i do recommend these</li>
    <li> I am personally not a fan of stickers I have found out but there is nothing really wrong with them.</li>
    <li> Some of the designs I don&#x27;t care for,  but there are too many that I will use to complain about a few that are not my style!</li>
    <li> These are cute and there are a ton of different stickers to choose from.  They stay put for several days too.  Check before you buy though because it took weeks for them to get here.... from Hong Kong.  They were not here in time for our party but the girls would have loved them.</li>
    <li> I bought this to put in some Easter Baskets that I made for my grown granddaughters.  I made them a nail salon basket, with every thing they need to do there nail, even with lots of decorations.  They loved them.</li>
    <li> These are easy to apply and there are a great assortment of these nail art stickers.They came before the delivery date which also impressed me.</li>
