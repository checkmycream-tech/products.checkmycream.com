<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is amazing. used it most of my life (50 yrs)and helped to heal most cuts and scrapes in record time.Other stuff isn&#x27;t nearly as effective. J and J... PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!!</li>
    <li> Every now and then I get a rash, which the doctor calls shingles. NOTHING ELSE HELPS heal it; but this cream. I have had a stock of it, which I have continued to use for this problem; but now it&#x27;s gone and NOTHING ELSE HELPS the burning, the itch and the pain. The rash is only irritated by other products. I need THIS FIRST AID CREAM. I don&#x27;t understand why it helps; but ONE or TWO applications in a 24 hour period of THIS CREAM and the rash dries up and goes away. I NEED IT. HELP ME FIND SOME OF THIS CREAM, PLEASE.</li>
    <li> I cannot find this product anywhere.  It is the best first aid cream on the market.  J &amp; J needs to bring it back just as it was.  Remember when Coke changed to \\&quot;NEW coke?\\&quot;  Mistake....BIG mistake!  Please market this product again.</li>
    <li> Johnson &amp; Johnson \\&quot;First Aid\\&quot; cream is one of the best products ever created. A little smart marketing could have made a world of difference, because everyone who tries this product loves it! \\&quot;First Aid\\&quot; cream is effective when used on: Cold sores, minor cuts/scrapes, burns, rashes, vaginitis, blisters, and skin ulcers. I did find an online petition to J&amp;J to bring it back:[...]</li>
    <li> What a shame this product has been discontinued. I hope all our comments compel Johnson &amp; Johnson to bring it back on the market. Have used this since I was a kid (70 plus years) and it is still absoslutely the best product on the market.  Have no idea what to substitute . . though believe there is no substitute.</li>
    <li> I was running out of my Johnson &amp; Johnson First Aid Cream and could not find it for sale in any of the stores around where I live so I decided to try to find it on Amazon, and boy am I upset!  This is the ONLY product that helps me with healing.  This stuff is amazing!  I have been using it for 30 years, ever since my dad bought me a first aid kit when my kids were little and there was a tube of this stuff in it. I would be happy to pay more for it if J&amp;J would bring it back!  This is very upsetting :(  My only hope is to find a tube or an old first aid kit with a tube in it for sale at some store that doesn&#x27;t rotate much stock!</li>
    <li> Johnson &amp; Johnson is a superb product for healing of all skin irritations, minor cuts, scrapes and burns. There is no other product like it available. I have succesfully used this product for many years for face sunburn, windburn, swelling and redness under the eyes, and general healing of facial irritations.        Key ingredients are beeswax &amp; trisodium phosphate. Other ingredients are   benzyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, cetylpyridinium chloride, glyceryl stearate, hydroxypropyl methylcellolose, isopropyl palmitate, stearyl alcohol, palmitamidopropyl trimonium chloride,&amp; water.     Unfortunately, this product is no longer generally available in stores, and appears to be available only through a few internet providers    Dino Quintanilla  Garland, Tx   4 July, 2009</li>
    <li> This product has been around for years but for some unknown reason I could not find it in stores such as Wal-Mart, large pharmacies, etc. It was almost like it had been discontinued but Amazon came through again!</li>
    <li> This is an old-fashioned product good for soothing and healing minor cuts and scrapes.  I can&#x27;t find it locally anymore.  I prefer it to the antibiotic creams that are available. So glad to find it listed on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have searched every store for J&amp;J First Aid Cream. It is a unique product and I can&#x27;t find it anywhere. Is it only available on-line?</li>
    <li> This innocuous cream really works!  I use it first for cuts, abrasions, rashes, and itchy or scaly patches, and it never irritates.  It heals many skin lesions that are not helped by prescription creams or other over-the-counter creams such as Neosporin or hydrocortisone cream.  Sometimes it can be hard to find, which puzzles me, but it is usually available at Walgreen&#x27;s and similar drug store chains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED 7/17/13:  A few years ago, Johnson and Johnson stopped manufacturing this cream.  It&#x27;s a great shame.  To speed healing of superficial cuts and abrasions, you might want to try [[ASIN:B000052XOY Aquaphor Healing Ointment]], which my dermatologist recently recommended for healing a biopsy wound.  Apparently the current medical thinking is that superficial wounds heal best when covered and kept moist with [[ASIN:B001ECQ4L2 Vaseline]] or a product like Aquaphor.</li>
    <li> Johnson &amp; Johnson First Aid Cream is the best way to heal cuts or small wounds on the body.  I have used it for 50 years and it is hard to find at the drug stores but find it on Amazon now in several places.    But don&#x27;t forget to put a bandage on top.  It will pull infection from the wound very quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. As others have said, it helps in healing skin that has breaks or cracks in it. I occasionally get small, \\&quot;cold sore\\&quot; cracks in the corners of my mouth, and nothing has helped to provide relief, (coating the area provides a soothing protective barrier), protect my skin, (keeps other germs away from the area), and heal it so quickly, (as the cream &#x27;dries out&#x27;, it helps provide a protective layer over my skin; repeat applications help the sore get smaller &amp; smaller), as this First Aid Cream. I&#x27;ve been so satisfied with it, that I have told my doctor how it provides relief and helps my skin to heal faster. I don&#x27;t know which ingredient it contains that makes it work so well, I just know, it is great at shortening the healing time of cold sores. --  PJ</li>
    <li> I am fortunate to have purchased several extra tubes before this product was discontinued... It is the fastest healing cream, and infection inhibitor I have ever used... Cannot believe it is no longer available.... What a shame!</li>
    <li> I have been using Johnson &amp; Johnson First Aid Cream for many years and this stuff is magic.  It seems to make minor cuts and scrapes heal faster, better, and without leaving any scarring. At least that&#x27;s the way it seems to work for me. I&#x27;ve tried other antibiotics and first aid creams and none of them seem to work nearly as well.   For some skin problems I have found even better success by mixing a small blob of J&amp;J First Aid Cream with similar blobs of either cortisone cream or antifungal cream or both.  Yes, the cost on this item is high but for me, it is worth it! Caveat emptor, it may work differently for different people - I have not attempted any kind of scientific study. I just know it is something I always want to have on hand in my medicine chest! I only regret that it appears it is not currently being sold in stores any more. Thank goodness Amazon still has it!</li>
    <li> I am a diabetic.  Anytime I have the beginnings or already established cut, wound, mosquito bite, any form of break in my skin I use this product.  It is a Godsend.  It draws the infection out and expedites healing tremoundously.  I have recommended it to many many people only to find it is not available anymore.  I am at a loss as to what I can find to use.  Please, please put this product back on the market.  I know of nothing else like it.</li>
    <li> This product has been discontinued.  I was unhappy with the fact that each tube added over $4 in shipping and handling when all tubes came in the same box.  But, as I said - there was really no where else to buy it.</li>
    <li> I had no idea that this product had gone out of production.  Have used for years and when I went to buy more it was no longer there.  One of the most effect creams I have ever used and if at all possible, please  bring it back. Other products just do not work the same way.</li>
    <li> Johnson &amp; Johnson, could you please let us know why you discontinued this product. (First-Aid Cream 1.5 oz.) Are you going to put it back on the market? and if so when?  What can I as a customer do to help get this 1.5 oz. First-Aid Cream back on the market?  If you could tell me what to do I will.  This is the BEST product ever created. There is No substitute for this product. If you put this product back on the market I will buy the first case of it. I have used this product for over 30 years. Did you make a produck to replace this First-Aid Cream &amp; if so what?   Does anyone have a petiton going to bring this back?  If so let us know.  Thanks   Big Jim</li>
    <li> Johnson and Johnson First Aid, First Aid Cream was the best!  Please bring it back!  It not only help  heal it also prevented bruising.  Rubbing it in right after a car door was slammed on my hand, I had no bruising at all.  After this I found if you rubbed it into old bruises they went away.  I do not think there is a first aid cream on the market that is as good as this cream.  PLEASE START MAKING IT AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Great stuff especally for people who can&#x27;t tolerate neo-mycin, the active ingridient in many first air products.</li>
    <li> PLEASE WRITE TO JOHNSON&amp;JOHNSON AT [...] ON THEIR WEBSITE AND ASK THEM TO BRING BACK Johnson &amp; Johnson First-Aid Cream!  I just did!  Need your support!  Thank You!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product that I&#x27;ve used for years. Don&#x27;t know what to switch to. The ointments were unsuccessful. Was very sorry to hear it was discontinued by J &amp; J. I called them yesterday and they said that they might bring it back if they get enough calls about product. Please call them to get it back. I believe the original price was about $3.00.</li>
    <li> If Johnson and Johnson does not want to produce it, they should freely give the formula to some company that will.</li>
    <li> This item takes the soreness out of a wound...have used it for years.  I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like this product is no longer available...have even tried to find it at Johnson and Johnson&#x27;s website.  I think there are still a few small tubes in the First Aid kits that are sold in stores...good luck.  The other first aid creams just don&#x27;t take away the soreness as this one...BRING IT BACK!!</li>
    <li> This a product I have used for years.  I shopped 7 local stores, but could not find. It was great to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Johnson and Johnson&#x27;s First Aid Cream is the best cut, itch, skin cream ever made. I don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;ll do without it since J&amp;J has stopped making it. If anyone from J&amp;J reads this please tell your management to put this product back on the market and increase the price if you have to because it&#x27;s that good and millions of people relied on it being there.</li>
    <li> I wish this cream is still sold in store but too bad there is no one selling it anymore. The only con I find about this cream is the shipping. Shipping should be lower as it drives the overall price too high. Benefits of this cream is awesome. It heals wound and get rid of itchiness very quickly and effectively. Great product to be have at home.</li>
    <li> (+) Having dry skin cracking, First Aid Cream is essential to soften and prevent infection.  It also gives relief of minor pain.  I&#x27;ve found no other product that compares.      (-) This product used to be commonly available anywhere medical supplies were sold.  For several years it has been left out of inventory at such medical supply sources as; Wal Mart; K-Mart; Wallgreen; and CVS Drugs.  Rather than over the counter purchase, having to buy on line, the freight doubles the cost of product.</li>
    <li> A review of the net will show that many people want this product.    The cream promoted incredibly fast healing for the skin and now it is gone.   The absence has caused me personal pain and suffering.   Seriously.   Occasionally with runners chafing issues, the cream cleared up the skin wound overnight.   Without the cream, I have tried everything and nothing works as well.   This includes a desperate use of my kid&#x27;s diaper cream.    NOTHING ...   NOTHING has worked better...   Was it the \\&quot;beeswax\\&quot;?   A perfect mix of chemicals?   I don&#x27;t know.   Either the product was removed due to either lack of profit or liability issues, but it seems quite sad J and J can&#x27;t release the formula to a \\&quot;niche\\&quot; chemist who can mix it up and charge a bit more for those of us in need.     Isn&#x27;t there a win-win option for Johnson and Johnson on this?????</li>
    <li> The Johnson &amp; Johnson First Aid Cream is the BEST all purpose cream I have EVER used.  I have always had a tube in my purse ~ I use it for every-day hand cream, not just for first aid.  I&#x27;ve used it for many, many years....my boys are now in their 30&#x27;s, and they remember me always having a tube in my purse at church!  Now I keep it on hand for my five grandchildren, as well as myself.  I was very upset when I heard the company had stopped making it ~ what a loss!  That is why I have bought all the extra tubes that I could afford to have a little \\&quot;back stock\\&quot;.  I am, however, disappointed that Fair Haven is taking advantage of this situation.  I used to pay $2.97 for a tube at Walmart, maybe $3.97 anywhere else, and now Fair Haven is charging a shocking $10.00 a tube!  Too bad they had to take advantage of this unfortunate situation....shame on them.</li>
    <li> Why has Johnson &amp; Johnson not been distributing one of the best healing cremes around.  If sales were down maybe it&#x27;s because there wasn&#x27;t enough advertising alotted for this item. The younger crowd is not familiar with an item that was practically in every home, not that long ago. Please, please bring it back! thank you</li>
    <li> The very best product for those &#x27;boo-boos!&#x27; Heals the wounds fast and just love the immediate &#x27;anesthetic&#x27; effect when applied to your wounds.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years but as of late I can&#x27;t find it in drug stores.  I was delighted to find it on Amazon. The product is excellent and the Amazon purchasing experience was easy,accurate, and timely.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this on Amazon since I can no longer find it in stores.  My granddaughters all know this as Nana&#x27;s \\&quot;Magic Cream\\&quot; that takes the pain out of every boo boo.  I&#x27;m ordering a supply for all my family.</li>
    <li> I tried to buy it in grocery store, but I couldn&#x27;t find it.  My mom was not happy when she wanted to buy it.  My sister works in CVS, but she couldn&#x27;t  buy it for mom.  Every one in our family blamed her.  We gave up using it for about 2 years.    I am still worry that the quality of it from mail order.  Hope this cream is not a fake one.  I couldn&#x27;t prove it, I wonder Amazon can prove it.  Anyway, I am glad that Amazon provide sale on this product.  The delivery was quick.  So far, mom got it for a month, she didn&#x27;t complain. We used to buy the small 1 oz pack that she can put inside her purse with her.</li>
    <li> Please call Johnson &amp; Johnson and get them to bring back this fabulous cream!!!!  I have been using it for years and absolutely love it!  Nothing else works as well.  Here is their phone number:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;800-526-3967&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If enough people call, they said they might bring it back.  PLEASE do it!  We can&#x27;t just let this product slip away.  Nothing out there heals wounds as quickly, painlessly, and completely.  It&#x27;s a miracle cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you call, they will take it down and send your request over to their marketing department.  Don&#x27;t sit back.  Do it.  It&#x27;s a free call and this stuff is THE BEST!  I think it&#x27;s just outdated packaging and they never market it, so new consumers don&#x27;t know anything about it.  A new packaging and some marketing might jump start the product.  There are enough of us out here who would do testimonials for it, that&#x27;s for sure!!!</li>
    <li> I love Johnson &amp; Johnson First-Aid cream because it&#x27;s great for protecting the skin while it heals yet doesn&#x27;t contain an anti-biotic or cortisone--I don&#x27;t always need or want those ingredients.  Even helps heal chapped hands!</li>
    <li> My husband, a physician, swears by Johnson and Johnson First Aide Cream as a means of preventing infection and sealing small wounds.   Having gotten several knife cuts, I can attest to its value.  The first cut I got several weeks ago did not heal easily and got infected.   The subsequent cuts healed almost immediately after using J&amp;J Cream.</li>
    <li> My family has used this cream for 30 years and we can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore!  It is the best!  It has a pain killer in it that works immediately and it is greaseless.  I won&#x27;t use Neosporin or Bacitracyn because they are so greasy!  Please keep selling this!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and product was exactly what I wanted, especially since we could not locate at any stores.  Excellent!</li>
    <li> My mother has many allergies and sensitivities.  She cannot use creams and lotions with Aloe and other additives.  J&amp;J First Aid Cream provides the soothing, healing comfort that she needs without concern to allergic reactions.</li>
    <li> love this stuff been around for a long time.Can&#x27;t find it any where anymore but here.thanks</li>
    <li> Anytime I had cuts or lesions, it was my go to first aid cream, and worked healing wounds much faster than anything else I had tried, I mean shortened healing by several days.&lt;br /&gt;I guess we were not cutting ourselves enough for Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s liking, and not using enough of it ;-)&lt;br /&gt;Just another disgruntled customer of J&amp;J&#x27;s arbitrarily dropping a great product!&lt;br /&gt;J&amp;J are constantly advertising that they are a family company, how their name is supposed to be meaningful, but what of the family of their customers, I guess they don&#x27;t include us!</li>
    <li> This is (or WAS) a Great product.... but it is no longer available ANYWHERE. I believe that J&amp;J has stopped producing this cream, as more people lean to the &amp;#34;Triple-Antibiotic&amp;#34; ointments. Sorry to see it go. For some things, it worked far better (for me) than anything else. There seem to be several other makers of creams that might well be either similar or virtually &amp;#34;the Same Formula&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Please,please,please bring this first aid cream by johnson &amp; johnson back on the market.  I can&#x27;t find anything that is&lt;br /&gt;good as this.  I have used it for years, and it works very well.  I have checked in every store and cannot find it.  It is a&lt;br /&gt;shame that so many people like this and it is not available.</li>
    <li> This has been my best skin cream for a decade or more. Better than any cream I have ever used.I can&#x27;t believe they stopped making it. Rashes, burns, pimples, whatever.First ingredient is beeswax!</li>
    <li> Best crème.  Heals instantly.  Unfortunately it has been discontinued.Huge mistake by J&amp;J</li>
    <li> My mom was allergic to every, and I mean *every*, other wound or burn cream on the market.  The last year of her life we made do with what we could find, to the indifference of J&amp;J.  I believe they&#x27;re still making it but doling it out only to J&amp;J employees.  You can&#x27;t pay people enough for this kind of corporate indifference, I guess, so J&amp;J folk get a free tube of it with every paycheck.  Nice work if you can get it.</li>
    <li> J&amp;J First aid cream  Why would a company stop making a great product like their first aid cream? It was a vey good \\&quot;healer\\&quot; and all these antibiotic ointments can&#x27;t hold a candle to it.  PLEASE bring it back soon..</li>
    <li> I, too, learned too late that this product had been discontinued. If I&#x27;d have known, I would have stocked up. I had a nasty cut on my finger about 10 days ago, and if I&#x27;d had Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s First-aid Cream, within a few hours, the paid would have been completely gone, and it would have healed in a day or two. Instead, I&#x27;ve been putting Neosporin on it, and it keeps cracking open-- it&#x27;s just as painful as it was 10 days ago! As my mom used to say, \\&quot;Nothing takes the soreness out like Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s First-aid Cream.\\&quot; We were never without it when I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed them about a year ago when I realized it was no longer in stores. Hopefully, they will see all these reviews on Amazon and bring it back!</li>
    <li> This product is FANTASTIC!  I don&#x27;t know why Johnson &amp; Johnson took this product off the market.  They must BRING IT BACK!</li>
    <li> Why on earth did you drop this product, Johnson &amp; Johnson??? This product has always been the VERY BEST healing cream  product EVER!!! My wife and I have used it for years. Whatever possessed your Marketing Department to discontinue your First Aid Cream???!!! We will be boycotting all of your other products because of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Very disappointed customers.</li>
    <li> This was the best first aid cream I ever used.  Please put it back again on the market!  Nothing else works as well.  I really pray that you will market it again!  Please!!!</li>
    <li> I SOOOO miss this stuff. Why did they do away with it. I hate everything else ... hate Neosporin. It healed things so fast. So so sad and mad at J&amp;J. :(</li>
    <li> I purchased J&amp;J First Aid Cream on line a few years ago because I could not find it in any store, and now I can&#x27;t find it on line either!  My wife only finds relief with this specific cream, nothing else works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe Johnson &amp; Johnson pulled the First Aid Cream product from the market.  There is a definite need for this product, perhaps you (J&amp;J) should market to customer needs instead of shareholder wants!</li>
    <li> This cream is magical and there is nothing like it in the market. Both my husband and I used it for many years for many reasons - cuts, rashes, irritations, bug bites, chapped lips, dry noses. It heals faster than anything we&#x27;ve found out there. When we heard from our pharmacist back in 2010 that it was discontinued, we bought many tubes on line through Amazon and other sources. We still have some and use it carefully as if it were made of gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several on line petition generating websites such as [...] . If we can get enough support starting with folks who have reviewed it here on Amazon, and getting everyone we know to get everyone they know to sign it, and so on, we might get enough signatures to impress them. I will try to contact J&amp;J product management and see how many signatures would interest them enough to consider manufacturing it again. I called them in 2010 but got nothing other than \\&quot;sorry, all I know is that it was discontinued.\\&quot; I will try again. Everyone needs to call them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please post any info or suggestions about getting a petition started. I&#x27;ve never used the on line sites to start one.</li>
    <li> I have used for years first aid cream at night for the occasional chapped ass. Petroleum jellies and poly-neo,sporin, etc do not work. J&amp;J was the miracle over night cure and I am shocked it is no longer on the shelf at drug stores. Now my son , who is a board certified Anesthesiologist calls me and tells me about his chapped butt( he walks 10 miles a day overseeing surgeries).  and wants my opinion. I told him J&amp;J first aid cream is the only thing that works over night , sorry its not available. You know, after you clean yourself up real good, you still need that overnight miracle to start the next day with no crack chap. I have one tube left I have hoarded, do I send it to him or what.  Anybody got any left, I will buy.</li>
    <li> No other cream works as well as this J&amp;J product.  I have found I have.adverse reaction to the two most common antibiotic creams.  Never had bad reaction to J&amp;J First Aid Cream and it worked so well preventing infection.  Please bring it back on the market.</li>
    <li> I have always relied on this product for so many things. It&#x27;s a miracle cure and safe to use&lt;br /&gt;Please bring back this product</li>
    <li> My mom used on an Aunt that had tried and been prescribed everything for a skin condition on her arm......this worked.  So since the age of 12 I&#x27;ve used it on 100s of occasions.  Couple years ago I could not find ANYWHERE so I called Johnson &amp; Johnson ..was told they no more made this medical cream... I was very, very sad as now what does one use....haven&#x27;t found anything anywheres as GREAT !</li>

    <li> I was packing my son&#x27;s stuff to go away to college and after going to every drugstore nearby as well as supermarkets and Target I was shocked to learn Johnson and Johnson First Aid Cream is no longer available. I have been using this cream my whole life and my mother used it before I did. There is none like it. When I burn myself in the kitchen I know that if I immedaitely put it on sometimes the burn won&#x27;t even blister. What happened to this product? I&#x27;ve recommended it for 30 years.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 50 years plus &amp; now its GONE!!! Nothing heals &amp; soothes like this.  My child, grown now, called it \\&quot;magic cream\\&quot;.  Now the grands depend on Memaw for \\&quot;magic cream\\&quot; &amp; nobody has it.  Hey JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON, put it back on the shelves for us.  This stuff will heal cracked &amp; peeling hands &amp; finger tips overnight.  I always bought 3 &amp; 4 tubes at a time.  Nothing else works like it.</li>
    <li> So sorry this product is off the market. My husband &amp; I have been using it for years. Mild and non-irritating, but always worked wonders.  Let&#x27;s hope J &amp; J will bring it back as there is really no product that can compare.</li>
    <li> It was the most dependable product ever.&lt;br /&gt; I will not buy J&amp;J products until they return this product to market.</li>
    <li> Love Johnson &amp; Johnson First Aid Cream! I am allergic to nearly everything else available without a prescription! Please bring this product back to your customers.</li>
    <li> GREAT product  - johnson &amp; johnson took it off the market - do not know why - bad move - wish they would start making it again!</li>
    <li> J &amp; J First aid cream is the most household versatile product.&lt;br /&gt;Please bring it back to market. We use it weekly or sometimes daily when available.</li>
    <li> I used this product for years and was very disappointed when it was no longer available.&lt;br /&gt;About a year ago I did find some at Big Lots and bought all they had.  PLEASE, PLEASE&lt;br /&gt;put this product back on the market!!!!</li>
    <li> I am a Vietnam Vet and was first introduced to J&amp;J first aid cream when I broke out with boils &amp; sores while serving in vietnam. I was amazed at the quick healing process after one day of using the product &amp; have been a faithful user of your first aid cream ever since. Why would you ever discontinue a product that helps so many. Please re-evaluate your decision &amp; get it back on the shelves asap.Nothing but nothing works like it. thank you.</li>
    <li> I have never found ANY other antibiotic cream that works like this one!!  Why would they EVER think of discontinuing it&#x27;s production??It works quicker than anything I&#x27;ve tried in bringing toxins out &amp; healing quickly!!</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S THE ONLY THING ON THE MARKET THAT WORKS...IS THAT WHY THEY DISCONTINUED IT?  I&#x27;M NOT BUYING ANYTHING ELSE.  WHOSE BRILLIANT DECISION WAS THIS?  FIRE THAT PERSON AND GET PRODUCTION ROLLING.</li>
