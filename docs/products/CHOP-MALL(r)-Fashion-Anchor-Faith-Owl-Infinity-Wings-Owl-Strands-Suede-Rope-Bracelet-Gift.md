    <li> Received late then it broke the first day I had it. Totally not worth my money</li>
    <li> Is just as it appears.  Excellent gift for my daughter!</li>
    <li> Really disappointed with quality of bracelet. Smaller than actual picture.</li>
    <li> The bracelet was great. It was a Christmas present to my daughter. She loved it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as big as the picture makes it to be</li>
    <li> Very poor quality and was unable to return. I guess you get what you pay for! Very cute braclet but the quality is so poor it broke the first time I tried putting it on</li>
    <li> I got busy and forgot the item said it&#x27;d shipped and realized it&#x27;d been a couple of months and I hadn&#x27;t received it.  I contacted the seller and they shipped it right away and I received it within a week.  I only gave them four stars because the picture makes it look like the charms (if that&#x27;s what they are called) are good sized and big on your arm.  They are not.  They are very little and they don&#x27;t lay flat so you can see them when you wear it.  Other than that I am happy with it and have had no problems.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for!  Cheap, Cheap, Cheap.  It took over a month to arrive, and day 2 of wearing it came apart.</li>
    <li> Beautiful but fragile. Broke same day arrived.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even get it in the mail it&#x27;s been over a month..</li>
    <li> Cheap clasp. Broke after wearing it twice. Cute bracelet.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful bracelet! It is exactly as seen in the picture and is connected by a lobster clasp. It is an eye catcher and easily something that can be worn daily</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even get anything it&#x27;s been over 2 months !</li>
    <li> Great bracelet but took a long time to recieve.</li>
    <li> They broke as soon as I got them</li>
    <li> Was not what I exspected</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. Do not  buy it. Easy to break</li>
