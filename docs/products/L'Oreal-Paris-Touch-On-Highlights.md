### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best Hair Highlighter !!</li>
      <li>I loved the results!</li>
      <li>IT WORKS GREAT</li>
      <li>Maybe this is another way to get you to buy more products to fix this one?!!  </li>
      <li>over Looked it &amp; used my Own Finger  LOL</li>
      <li>I was stunned to find all the good reviews on this product.  </li>
      <li>The hair highlighter itself is good.  </li>
      <li>I waited 30 minutes, shampooed it out, and my hair looks gorgeous now (</li>
      <li>Color is true to the box, works great!</li>
      <li>It was easy and worked great.</li>
      <li>I was very nervous about doing highlights myself, but this stuff is great!</li>
      <li>I really liked the creamy caramel color in my medium brown hair.  </li>
      <li>Let me add that I&#x27;ve been doing my own highlights for years, no problems.</li>
      <li>Good Luck :)</li>
      <li>Have been highlighting my own hair for years with the cap and hook.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve colored my own hair for years, and this was still a bit</li>
      <li>used More  Conditioner  of my own  ( i use Suave )</li>
      <li>I am pretty good at highlighting my own hair with the cap and hook.</li>
      <li>The color was a nice carmel and showed a contrast, although not a drastic one, to my light -medium brown hair.</li>
      <li>I wanted the tips of my hair to match the top, so I bought a box of the L&#x27;oreal touch on highlights, for medium brown-dark hair.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
      <li>I used revlons hair cap and it worked so much better..</li>
      <li>It was so easy and everyone thinks I had my hair done at the salon.</li>
      <li>However, now that I&#x27;ve discovered this easy way to highlight, I&#x27;ll stick to the Touch-On Highlights.</li>
      <li>I have dark brown hair and it highlights it perfectly.</li>
      <li>The kit is easy to use and the results were fabulous.</li>
      <li>When I went on vacation, the top part of my hair had turned golden from the sun.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the toasted almond on a red headed friend, and that looked great too.  </li>
      <li>I originally purchased this product for my daughter and her friend so that they could \\&quot;experiment\\&quot; with highlights.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
      <li>I was really reluctant to try this product, but I&#x27;m so glad that I did.</li>
      <li>(Looks kind of like a tiny bottle washer).  </li>
      <li>Except I HIGHLY recommend using a fine plastic comb (for like a buck at the store) instead of the finger applicator unless you want chunky highlights.</li>
      <li>your gonna need more then one box to have the same amount of highlights she has.</li>
      <li>I much prefer this technique; the fingertip thimble-like device that you just brush strands of hair, rather than the cap with the holes that drives me nuts!</li>
      <li>This is the first time I used this product.</li>
      <li>First of all, if you have fine hair the finger device will pull strands of hair out if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
      <li>Anyways, quick rundown of the story: I had colored medium brown hair that was considerably faded.</li>
      <li>Luckily I had saved the applicators from the old Loreal highlighting kit.  </li>
      <li>After 2 or 3 attempts to place highlights, I quickly washed my hair before the color developed.</li>
      <li>Buying a hair color brush (99c at a beauty store) makes the process much easier.  </li>
      <li>There were a few highlights that looked ok, but none looked professional, it clearly looks like a DIY dye job, cheap!</li>
      <li>I threw the whole thing away.</li>
      <li>I used the finger comb and applied it lightly throughout my entire head.</li>
      <li>The way you apply the highlights will affect the outcome just as much as the product itself.</li>
      <li>I simply should have gone to the salon, and had it done right the first time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised loreal is selling this, if this were the first loreal product I&#x27;d used I&#x27;d never use loreal again.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re not confident about coloring your own hair I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this stuff.  </li>
      <li>(Mind you, I now have a completely new problem with my hair!</li>
      <li>Main Point: this product gave me orange highlights</li>
      <li>The only challenge was that it can only stay on your hair for a certain period of time (I have fine hair, so</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for over 50 years and the Touch-On Highlights kit is by far the simplest I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>If you have never highlighted your hair before, please go to a professional.</li>
      <li>It worked really well and was fairly easy to use, the only thing is i felt bad throwing most of it away since there was so much left over.</li>
      <li>when I finish coating all of my hair, I needed to wash it off the first areas, but the last areas only just got covered, and you need to wash it all off at the same time.</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal, please change back to the old applicator.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now, and for me and my mouse-brown hair, it works well and looks pretty natural as a high-light.</li>
      <li>I only left it on for 15 minutes, and the highlights look very natural.</li>
      <li>I focused on the bottom half, with small bits here and there at the top.</li>
      <li>Plus need to make sure to apply enough on the strand of hair cus if not you will have it uneven and missing areas.</li>

<li> again.the finger glove sucked, you cant just grab every strand easily, there will be runaway strands and strands randomly sticking together.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used foil and when I&#x27;ve been in a rush I used my fingers to throw in a few highlights and it looked very natural.</li>
<li> Next time, I will do as the other reviews and find another applicator to use instead.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re tired of paying $90.00 for this process try this it really works!</li>
<li> left this on a Half hour  </li>
<li> Next let&#x27;s talk about the brassy tones, I wanted to cry when I saw how uneven and brassy the color was.</li>
<li> and it takes that time or longer to carefully coat the hair, so</li>
<li> I have short choppy hair that is a medium dark brown.</li>
<li> I am extremely dissapointed with L&#x27;Oreal and their customer service advice.</li>
<li> This finger device I feel gives you less control and is rough on your hair.  </li>
<li> Doing it at home is simply NOT worth it.</li>
<li> Now I have to dye my hair to get rid of this mess.</li>
<li> and now I have to color my hair again to get rid of the mess it made.  </li>
<li> All you do is put the developer and the bleach powder into the mixing tray, mix it, and then apply to your hair strands with the little rubber fingertip.  </li>
<li> I have little fingers and</li>
<li> I called the L&#x27;Oreal, and they said to not dye over it, because my hair would then turn green.</li>
<li> It is messy, hard to just put on the strands of hair you want</li>
<li> I only gave it four stars because of the fingertip applicator; a poorly designed and bulky tool for applying thin highlights.</li>
<li> I HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING IT IN THE STORES AROUND HERE</li>
<li> Then the highlights came out very unevenly, some were thin some were thick.</li>
<li> these stupid little plastic finger things fall off.  </li>
<li> I only gave this product 2 stars because it did indeed lighten my hair, just an awful shade.</li>
<li> This kit was impossible to use.</li>
<li> and I absolutely hate my hair.</li>
<li> the finger thing just fell off and was worthless.  </li>
<li> finger brush thing that comes in the box is totally worthless.</li>
<li> Hated the finger thing and you have no control over where the product ends up.</li>
<li> Parr of my hair turned orange, one of my shirts is ruined, my finger got burned, it was all around a terrible experience.  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now, and for me and my mouse-brown hair, it works well and looks pretty natural as a high-light.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for over 50 years and the Touch-On Highlights kit is by far the simplest I&#x27;ve ever used.  All you do is put the developer and the bleach powder into the mixing tray, mix it, and then apply to your hair strands with the little rubber fingertip.  I waited 30 minutes, shampooed it out, and my hair looks gorgeous now (if I say so myself).    Years ago, I used to frost my hair with the kits that have a cap with holes in it and you had to pull out your hair through the holes with a hook.  But that got to be a big hassle so I had gone back to regular hair dye. However, now that I&#x27;ve discovered this easy way to highlight, I&#x27;ll stick to the Touch-On Highlights.</li>
    <li> I was really reluctant to try this product, but I&#x27;m so glad that I did. I have short choppy hair that is a medium dark brown. I used this product, hoping that it would take away some of the brown flatness. I loved the results! I only left it on for 15 minutes, and the highlights look very natural. I only gave it four stars because of the fingertip applicator; a poorly designed and bulky tool for applying thin highlights. Next time, I will do as the other reviews and find another applicator to use instead.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product for my daughter and her friend so that they could \\&quot;experiment\\&quot; with highlights. The kit is easy to use and the results were fabulous.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Loreal products for years and am a fan but this product doesn&#x27;t work. First of all, if you have fine hair the finger device will pull strands of hair out if you&#x27;re not careful. Next let&#x27;s talk about the brassy tones, I wanted to cry when I saw how uneven and brassy the color was. Then the highlights came out very unevenly, some were thin some were thick.

This finger device I feel gives you less control and is rough on your hair.  Now I have to dye my hair to get rid of this mess. I&#x27;m too embarrassed to go outside! Maybe this is another way to get you to buy more products to fix this one?!!  I&#x27;m surprised loreal is selling this, if this were the first loreal product I&#x27;d used I&#x27;d never use loreal again.</li>

    <li> Best Hair Highlighter !!&lt;br /&gt;I used this Today, &amp; forget The Plastc Finger Tip.&lt;br /&gt;I over Looked it &amp; used my Own Finger  LOL&lt;br /&gt;I dont have Reactions  so  I didn&#x27;t use Gloves,&lt;br /&gt;I left this on a Half hour  ( i timed it with Kitchen timer )&lt;br /&gt;Im SO happy,&lt;br /&gt;My hair Is Shiny, Smooth,&lt;br /&gt;Looks Professional,&lt;br /&gt;I used Creamy Caramel  as i have Med Brown Hair,&lt;br /&gt;My Hair  Has Been Colored &amp; it worked Great,&lt;br /&gt;I used More  Conditioner  of my own  ( i use Suave )&lt;br /&gt;Save your Self $$$$ &amp; try this !!</li>
    <li> Have been highlighting my own hair for years with the cap and hook.  Thought this might be easier.  I was stunned to find all the good reviews on this product.  It is messy, hard to just put on the strands of hair you want and now I have to color my hair again to get rid of the mess it made.  Perhaps it was just me but the finger thing just fell off and was worthless.  Save your money!</li>
    <li> It worked really well and was fairly easy to use, the only thing is i felt bad throwing most of it away since there was so much left over.</li>
    <li> Parr of my hair turned orange, one of my shirts is ruined, my finger got burned, it was all around a terrible experience.  I will never buy this product again.the finger glove sucked, you cant just grab every strand easily, there will be runaway strands and strands randomly sticking together. And it does not evenly color (hence the orange) I used revlons hair cap and it worked so much better..</li>
    <li> Color is true to the box, works great! Except I HIGHLY recommend using a fine plastic comb (for like a buck at the store) instead of the finger applicator unless you want chunky highlights.</li>
    <li> I am pretty good at highlighting my own hair with the cap and hook. This kit was impossible to use. Hated the finger thing and you have no control over where the product ends up. After 2 or 3 attempts to place highlights, I quickly washed my hair before the color developed. I threw the whole thing away. I cannot imagine why anyone gave this 5 stars.</li>
    <li> If you have longer hair then the model on the box or the same length your gonna need more then one box to have the same amount of highlights she has. Plus need to make sure to apply enough on the strand of hair cus if not you will have it uneven and missing areas.</li>
    <li> The hair highlighter itself is good.  The applicator is a joke.  I have little fingers and these stupid little plastic finger things fall off.  Luckily I had saved the applicators from the old Loreal highlighting kit.  (Looks kind of like a tiny bottle washer).  L&#x27;Oreal, please change back to the old applicator.</li>
    <li> I was very nervous about doing highlights myself, but this stuff is great! It was so easy and everyone thinks I had my hair done at the salon. Ten minutes and you&#x27;re done.If you&#x27;re tired of paying $90.00 for this process try this it really works!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re not confident about coloring your own hair I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this stuff.  The way you apply the highlights will affect the outcome just as much as the product itself. This product is NOT foolproof. I&#x27;ve colored my own hair for years, and this was still a bit tricky.&lt;br /&gt;The finger brush thing that comes in the box is totally worthless. Don&#x27;t even try to use it, just throw it out.  Buying a hair color brush (99c at a beauty store) makes the process much easier.  Just section off your hair with clips, pull out a strand that you want to highlight, and brush on the color. Repeat, repeat, and repeat.  I really liked the creamy caramel color in my medium brown hair.  I&#x27;ve used the toasted almond on a red headed friend, and that looked great too.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any damage from using this product.  Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF. I HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING IT IN THE STORES AROUND HERE ANYMORE. IT WORKS GREAT AND DOESN&#x27;T DAMAGE YOUR HAIR.</li>
    <li> this came out just how I wanted it. I have dark brown hair and it highlights it perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have never made a review before, but I just had to share my frusturation. Main Point: this product gave me orange highlights and I absolutely hate my hair. Anyways, quick rundown of the story: I had colored medium brown hair that was considerably faded. When I went on vacation, the top part of my hair had turned golden from the sun. I wanted the tips of my hair to match the top, so I bought a box of the L&#x27;oreal touch on highlights, for medium brown-dark hair. I used the finger comb and applied it lightly throughout my entire head. I focused on the bottom half, with small bits here and there at the top. (Mind you, I did a test strip. It didn&#x27;t change my hair at all, so I figured I would just use a bit in my hair anyways hoping for a change this time.) Well, low and behold, after shampooing and conditioning my hair, I had orange, and plantinum blond streaks EVERYWHERE. I called the L&#x27;Oreal, and they said to not dye over it, because my hair would then turn green. So, what am I supposed to do??? A salon visit would cost nearly $150 to fix the $13 I spent on L&#x27;oreal highlights. Well, I didn&#x27;t have the money to get it color corrected at a salon, so I dyed over it with a medium brown. (Mind you, I now have a completely new problem with my hair! But I won&#x27;t bore you with the details.) So, please. If you have never highlighted your hair before, please go to a professional. Doing it at home is simply NOT worth it. I have spent upwards of $80 just to get my hair back to normal (and it still is not) through the use of other at home products. I simply should have gone to the salon, and had it done right the first time. And I still don&#x27;t have highlights in my hair. I am extremely dissapointed with L&#x27;Oreal and their customer service advice. They gave me no advice and asked me to fend for myself. I only gave this product 2 stars because it did indeed lighten my hair, just an awful shade. Good Luck :)</li>
    <li> This is the first time I used this product. It was easy and worked great. The only challenge was that it can only stay on your hair for a certain period of time (I have fine hair, so only ~10-15 min&#x27;s) and it takes that time or longer to carefully coat the hair, so when I finish coating all of my hair, I needed to wash it off the first areas, but the last areas only just got covered, and you need to wash it all off at the same time. So, I learned I need to plan well ahead of time, then put it on as quickly as possible.</li>
