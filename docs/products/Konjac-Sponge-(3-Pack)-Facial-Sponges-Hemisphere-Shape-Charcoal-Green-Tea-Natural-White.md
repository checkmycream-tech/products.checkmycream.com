      <li>Love these konjac facial sponges.</li>

      <li>You can use these many times and for so long.  </li>
      <li>It is gentle enough so that it does not irritate my skin, but effective in helping scrub off the top layers of dead skin.  </li>

      <li>Let&#x27;s see, I&#x27;ve always been using drug store cleansers my whole life</li>
      <li>This is the second time I purchase it, very soft and comfortable.</li>

      <li>I highly recommend these sponges to all skin types.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, I love that the company sends you little emails with FAQs and information about their product.</li>
      <li>No harsh scrubbing in skin it feels so gentle.</li>
      <li>- I did appreciate that a lot, as it&#x27;s always nice to have a little extra enjoyment when treating yourself to a new product.</li>
      <li>Well, first of all, I just love rubbing these little sponges on my face, they are just so soft enough for you to just rub and rub.</li>
      <li>Skin was very soft.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t use these for long enough to notice a huge result but I have faith in these that they will do miracles on my skin.</li>

      <li>but it&#x27;s soft</li>
      <li>Also, I won&#x27;t be making another amazon purchase again, I&#x27;ll buy these direct from the seller.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>They leave my face feeling sooo soft and I have also noticed that my face looks like I have used a toner.</li>
      <li>After using it, I can feel my face being so soft.</li>
      <li>I love the scent of the white one and the green one.</li>
      <li>They are a little small but they still do a good job at removing my makeup and my skin feels</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have tried the konjac sponges after recommendations from various blogs, due to their effectiveness at cleaning while providing gentle exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The product is nice texture, very spongy, but a little too small size in palm when using for facial cleanser.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bizarre but it still doesn&#x27;t feel good, I mean who wouldn&#x27;t want clear skin.</li>
      <li>I do use these on my face only because my face&#x27;s skin is very sensitive</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;ve only used the white one, but it&#x27;s become part of my daily exfoliating routine.  </li>

<li> (cup the curved portion in my palm, scrub with the flat side)</li>
<li> O and expect and little bit of irritation or &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; when you first start using them - it breaks down the dirt and allows the pores to purge it.</li>
<li> I rinse them in white vinegar and let them dry.</li>
<li> It comes with 3 -charcoal, green tea, and a natural white.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used more expensive konjac sponges from other companies but I have not noticed any difference in quality compared to these.</li>
<li> But my face&#x27;s skin is so sensitive that whatever I use, I&#x27;d get these little acne.</li>
<li> I use the charcoal one to tame my breakouts, then the green tea for calming the skin, and once everything is back to normal, I use the white sponge.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These seem like quality sponges but I find them a little bit small for washing my face. Maybe the heart-shaped ones are larger?  Edit: the heart shaped ones are larger, and for reference, the diameter of the one I&#x27;ve been using is 2.5 inches when fully expanded. Not tiny but the one I had from Innisfree for example was bigger and easier for me to handle.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have tried the konjac sponges after recommendations from various blogs, due to their effectiveness at cleaning while providing gentle exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually really like using the sponges for daily cleansing. I don&#x27;t find the exfoliation aspect to be harsh whatsoever and feel comfortable with using this in both the morning and the evening. I will sometimes even just use one on my face with water after taking a nap/resting, just to feel refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to get the &#x27;variety&#x27; pack to see if there was truly a difference. After using the three types, I honestly can&#x27;t say I have seen or felt any differences in how they perform. The exfoliation level and treatment on the skin seem the same, which is why I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5, as it advertised different effects from the three sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging I received from my seller (Pegasus Guild) was very enjoyable and made it a lot more fun to open - I did appreciate that a lot, as it&#x27;s always nice to have a little extra enjoyment when treating yourself to a new product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful experience. Would definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I purchase it, very soft and comfortable.</li>
    <li> The product is nice texture, very spongy, but a little too small size in palm when using for facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> I love the sponges!  So far, I&#x27;ve only used the white one, but it&#x27;s become part of my daily exfoliating routine.  It is gentle enough so that it does not irritate my skin, but effective in helping scrub off the top layers of dead skin.  I am looking forward to using the other two sponges too when it comes time for them!  And I have to mention how pretty the packaging is. Also, I love that the company sends you little emails with FAQs and information about their product. Great buy and will repurchase again once the time comes!</li>
    <li> Love these sponges! So gentle yet exfoliating on my face. Ready to buy more!!! Customer service is also really great and quick to respond, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Lovely sponges, I&#x27;m glad I got the 3 pack</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.  I wanted to get the makanai type from Japan. Those sponges really feel like a facial each time I use them.  These are nothing in comparison.  Sorry to say so but this is my experience.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:36d24a0e03d6e898decae897a4ee4962]] I have ordered from this company many times.  I did the slide show to express how amazing these are.  they are so soft on your face and the price is great. You can use these many times and for so long.  The packaging is super cute and comes with easy to follow instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this free or at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased feedback but I can tell you 100% these are wonderful.</li>
    <li> The charcoal beauty scrubber works wonders! I usually have issues with blackheads around my nose and just the first use it got rid of them. No harsh scrubbing in skin it feels so gentle. Shipped quickly as well I had it the next day!</li>
    <li> I started using the green tea sponge for cleaning my face. I use several cleanser with it and absolutely love the feel on my skin and gentle exfoliation massage. After using it my skin is very smooth and better receives all other products I use after cleansing. Very good products for daily use and very cute too. I did not find that the size is too small, it perfectly allows for circular motion all over the face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just purchased these for the second time because I was so impressed by what they&#x27;ve done for my skin. After a few months of using them with face wash, my complexion cleared up dramatically, enough that I ditched the face wash and started using them on their own with warm water. My skin has never been brighter or more clear - I&#x27;m so happy! I&#x27;ve used more expensive konjac sponges from other companies but I have not noticed any difference in quality compared to these. I definitely recommend these for anyone with any skin type.</li>
    <li> Over rated product but it&#x27;s soft</li>
    <li> Oh my these sponges are brilliant. I don&#x27;t even know where to start. Let&#x27;s see, I&#x27;ve always been using drug store cleansers my whole life and I thought I&#x27;d give these little ones a shot. They have been doing great on my skin. Though I only use it on my face, you can also use them on your body. You can use them without any cleansers and soaps but that wouldn&#x27;t be refreshing when washing your body, would it? I do use these on my face only because my face&#x27;s skin is very sensitive and I like to separate what I use on my face and body. Plus my body&#x27;s skin is doing fine with body wash and wash cloth. But my face&#x27;s skin is so sensitive that whatever I use, I&#x27;d get these little acne. It&#x27;s not bizarre but it still doesn&#x27;t feel good, I mean who wouldn&#x27;t want clear skin. Look at me going on and on about stuff and forgetting about these brilliant sponges. Well, first of all, I just love rubbing these little sponges on my face, they are just so soft enough for you to just rub and rub.They have never give me any acne. they clean my face well. I don&#x27;t use it with cleansers because I want to know how these little sponges do without a cleanser and they are doing wonderful. After using it, I can feel my face being so soft. Also I started noticing my acne being gone a bit. I haven&#x27;t use these for long enough to notice a huge result but I have faith in these that they will do miracles on my skin. I love the scent of the white one and the green one. Although,  the charcoal one does have a little charcoal scent which makes me feel like I&#x27;m cooking my face (lol), it&#x27;s a wonderful sponges. I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone. Give these little ones a chance to do some miracles on your skin ~ :D Oh and I got these little ones in exchange of an honest review from the wonderful seller &amp;#34;Beth&amp;#34; ~</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:fb14c0359707f6f1359833bf6d59e10]] Love these konjac facial sponges. This is a great mixed box of sponges. It comes with 3 -charcoal, green tea, and a natural white. You can use these sponges to wash your face and body, but I mostly use it as a facial sponge. I like that you can use these sponges without any face wash although I prefer using the sponges in combination with a facial soap. They leave my skin feeling soft and don&#x27;t cause any type of irritation. These sponges are great for all skin types from sensitive to oily. The mixed box is my favorite because each sponge is good for something different. Charcoal is great for acne, green tea is good for damaged skin and the natural white is good for gentle cleansing. So I switch up the sponges daily depending on how my skin feels when its wash time. I highly recommend these sponges to all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> First let me say it was a heaven send. There was a sponge for each skin concern in our house. The White one was used with no soap, I was told it felt great on their skin and they loved how it felt afterwards. The Black one was used with medicated facial cleanser, normally drying in some areas. Their skin looked healthy afterwards, not shiny, not dry. Skin was very soft. Now Green, I decided to use it cleanser, did not pat dry. There was no pulling feeling, no dryness, no skin turning white because of dryness. I felt like I did not need any moisturizer, but my vanity got the best of me and I put some 10 minutes later. My skin feels so good I felt like it should be kissed, but since there was no one who would do it, I blew myself one.</li>
    <li> The sponges work well and are as described. They are a little small but they still do a good job at removing my makeup and my skin feels&lt;br /&gt;smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> This gift pack of 3 sponges are a wonderful way to say thank you to a special teacher, employee,  hostess, or just because.&lt;br /&gt;After soaking in water for a few minutes, they provide a gentle cleansing with mild exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soaring in popularity, this type of sponge definitely has a &#x27;cool&#x27; factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received to test with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted.</li>
    <li> I wanted to give these a few weeks so I could honestly give an accurate review. So here goes:&lt;br /&gt;These are awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Once I figured out how to best hold them for me (cup the curved portion in my palm, scrub with the flat side) it became really easy to use. These have very gentle physical exfoliation, so they&#x27;re perfect to cleanse with and prep my skin for my (many many) actives/serums/etc.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly they&#x27;re worth the cost.</li>
    <li> The product showed up on time which was great. Once I started to use the sponges I&#x27;m not sure if it was my new face scrub jell or the sponge but overall it works. I started to notice after a week that my face was clearing up.. So I love it and would recommend these sponges, plus they are cute and the box is pretty.. 😊</li>
    <li> These sponges are amazing! They leave my face feeling sooo soft and I have also noticed that my face looks like I have used a toner. Totally recommend these to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> Have face nice and smooth</li>
    <li> I love these sponges! I get rough dry patches on my face because I just moved to the desert and my skin is still adjusting. I use the charcoal one to tame my breakouts, then the green tea for calming the skin, and once everything is back to normal, I use the white sponge. This 3 pack is great if you want to try the sponges for the first time, but trust me, you&#x27;ll never use a wash cloth again after this! I should also mention that I don&#x27;t use the sponges with water - I use grapeseed oil to cleanse and witch hazel to tone. I rinse them in white vinegar and let them dry. I don&#x27;t trust the water in my new area yet (hard water + sensitive skin &#x3D; nightmare) but these work great with any routine! O and expect and little bit of irritation or &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; when you first start using them - it breaks down the dirt and allows the pores to purge it. Also, don&#x27;t put your regular cleanser on the sponge until you know how your skin will react. Give it 7 to 10 days. But coming from someone who has &amp;#34;tried everything&amp;#34;, I think you&#x27;ll love these! I do! Also, I won&#x27;t be making another amazon purchase again, I&#x27;ll buy these direct from the seller.</li>
