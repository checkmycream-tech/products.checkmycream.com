      <li>A nice thick cream that makes me feel like I am doing something good for my skin.  </li>
      <li>All that I expected, plus pleasant scent...been wanting to try it for years...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought these for my mom per her request and she absolutely loves them. Her skin maintains a younger youthful appearance</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference</li>
    <li> Like the cream, good price.</li>
    <li> Soft, smells good and provides true moisture without feeling super greasy.  When I first put it on, it feels thick and looks shiny, but it&#x27;s gone in no time, and I think it has really improved the texture and look of my skin.  It&#x27;s definitely helping with the fine lines and discoloration I have.</li>
    <li> This night cream is very rich and feels great on my dry skin.</li>
    <li> nice face cream, doesn&#x27;t feel as creamy as I would expect for a night cream</li>
    <li> I keep re-ordering this product.  Always satisfied!</li>
    <li> Lovely product and incredibly fast delivery.</li>
    <li> One of the best night creams I&#x27;ve used.  Big Avon fan.  Will definitely order again. The day cream is just as good.</li>
    <li> This is cream is excellent for antiaging</li>
    <li> Good product, it works well.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I use it both night and day.</li>
    <li> I have used it for years wouldn&#x27;t go without it!</li>
    <li> My sister gave me this cream as a gift  I forgot I had it until I ran out of my usual day moisturizer.  I started using this and I&#x27;m hooked.  The results have been pretty awesome.  Because it is intended as a night cream it is more viscous and takes a little longer to absorb before applying makeup, but I&#x27;ve adjusted my morning routine to allow for that. I am 61 and since I&#x27;ve started using this, I&#x27;m getting compliments on how great my skin looks.</li>
    <li> It always perks up my face! There&#x27;s a very slight burn to it which I assume means itis sloughing off skin.</li>
    <li> best skin cream I have ever used! I have used quite a number during my 50 plus years and this one I will use for the rest of my life! My skin purrs when its on!</li>
    <li> Avon Anew is the best night cream I have ever used.  Enough said - this was a great price also.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer, it makes my skin feel good and soft.</li>
    <li> This anti-aging really works, I use it after years and I am glad with results (and much better combined with serum), often I hear people saying that I look younger than my age. And bonus for seller too, my cream arrived one week early than expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and can find no other, even Lancome, that does a better job on my 74 year old skin.  I am delighted  to find it as cheaply as I do on Amazon.</li>
    <li> A nice thick cream that makes me feel like I am doing something good for my skin.  Although, my skin doesn&#x27;t look like the avon models.  No smell which I like.  Fast delivery too.</li>
    <li> It works well on dryness. Tingles so it must have a bit of retinol. My wrinkles are still there but, at 67 what can i expect? I will buy it again as its is resonable, and helps with my tight,dry face. This is my 4th bottle so I must like it.</li>
    <li> I have used Avon Anew anti-aging day and night facial products for 10 years or so now, and I am so pleased with these creams in how they have reduced lines/wrinkles, and stay moisturizing all the day long.  No one can believe I am 50 years old when they look at me!  I&#x27;ve never paid full price for them, as thankfully they are available for a reduced cost on a variety of websites, including Amazon. YAY!&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
    <li> so far i do like this product!!! it arrived exactly as it stated (promptly).  I will reorder when i need it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good cream that I have used for a number of years.  However, this price is much better and the shipping speed was great.  This is a great night cream, not greasy and does it&#x27;s work while you are asleep.  Keeps the skin nice and smooth!</li>
    <li> This is the only night cream that works well with my very, very sensitive skin.  I have been using this for yours and I am glad and thankful that Amazons&#x27; sellers have this cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several months. I have used more expensive formulas, but I think this works just as good or better.</li>
    <li> It has a very strong musk perfume odor. It disturbed my sleep with the strong smell. I am returning the product.</li>
    <li> I love this product would recommend to anyone, have been using it for many years now. It really made a difference.</li>
    <li> I have used it for years &amp; am always complemented on my skin smoothness &amp; softness. It is the best cream I have used for the price. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> The cream has a mild scent, but not too much, which is good because I don&#x27;t like heavy scents and generally any scent.  I like the way the cream applies and the only reason it&#x27;s not a 5 star is that I have no idea if it makes a difference on my skin, but it might.  I like it better that Olay Microsculpting.  I thing people overrate these products because any type of moisturizing cream helps the skin&#x27;s appearance. If someone disagrees, let me know, because I&#x27;d love a cream that actually reduces wrinkles and such.</li>
    <li> Loved the former product of this line, but it was discontinued. Why fix it when it&#x27;s not broke ? Companies do that all the time and it makes me mad. After the former one was discontinued I used for a while just jojoba oil. Loved it until I saw here and there a pimple coming up. I have mature skin so I thought ok give the new ultimate product a try. Yuk ! When I put it on my face it slapped me with the fragrance ! I&#x27;m used to it now and will use it up, but it was huge to go from jojoba oil to a way over fragranced product. Most people don&#x27;t even realize how much fragrance is in products because they are used to it ! I will not buy again. Have to find me a good natural night cream .</li>
    <li> I Love this stuff.  They discontinued my anew i had been using for years and years it took a couple of tried but the ultimate is the closest to what i was using and i am not allergic like i am with some of the other anews.  Thanks to Avon and my mom&#x27;s genes @46 i have almost no wrinkles!</li>
    <li> All that I expected, plus pleasant scent...been wanting to try it for years...there&#x27;s no more I want to say about the product</li>
    <li> I love this line of Avon products and I am not a big Avon fan.  This works better for me than Olay, Este Lauder, Lancome, and some pricier products I have tried.  I see real results with this line.  I am over 60 so do not expect miracles but this does make a big, noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> I finally found a product that works.&lt;br /&gt;I use the day and night Ultimate 7s as well as the serum&lt;br /&gt;I have used many products that looked promising and after a week, stop.&lt;br /&gt;This night cream makes my skin soft, smooth and lessens lines.  Most disappear and that is wonderful.  Of course, they won&#x27;t disappear permanently because you need surgery for that!&lt;br /&gt;But, it helps keep new ones from appearing and it hides the ones I have.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is not greasy.  Just moisturize and softness.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it&lt;br /&gt;And, you use so much less then other creams</li>
    <li> this is the ultimate night cream from Avon, the piece of resistance that makes people buy the cream a lot. the ultimate solution.</li>
    <li> been using this product for 15 years.  People do not believe I am 70!</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this cream for eve. and all night long.  It works really good and&lt;br /&gt;it stays on good and keeps skin nice and moist.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Anew moisturizing creams for years now.  Many years ago I read an unbiased article in a magazine where the so-called &amp;#34;experts&amp;#34; had tested many moisturizers.  Can&#x27;t remember how many but it was a pretty big number.  As in hundreds.  Avon&#x27;s Anew moisturizing creams came in right up there at the top.  I can&#x27;t recall exactly but it was in the top 5 at least.  Anyway, that was comparing it to many of the creams that cost over $100 too.  So.....I decided to try it and I have been happy with it for all these years.  I really think it does the job.  Depending on your age and your preference, any of the Anew Creams are good.  I would highly recommend them.  Watch for the sales too.  Several times a year Avon has them on sale.  Buy one, get one half off or something like that.  I usually buy my Avon stuff at an Avon store located within a local flea market because the prices are better.  This price was about the same though and it saved me a trip.</li>
    <li> My wife is happy, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> Excellent face cream.</li>
    <li> has a strange scent; I thought a skank came to my yard at first...I doubt I&#x27;ll get it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years, so I knew it was tops already. But my Avon lady recently got out of the business. Im so glad I have backup and that I can still use this great product because you guys carry it!</li>
    <li> Only product I can use for sensitive skin. Live it!</li>
    <li> SO FAR I REALLY LIKE THIS CREAM, ONLY BEEN USING IT FOR 3 DAYS.IT FEELS GREAT AND HAS A NICE SMELL.</li>
    <li> I hate the smell, smells like Pond&#x27;s cold cream, I never used this product before so I can&#x27;t say if that is the real smell or if I got a fake. I have my doubts. Will never buy again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE it. The smell is wonderful and the results are amazing (keeps face moisturized all night)</li>
    <li> Excellent service recommended!&lt;br /&gt;Avon productos number 1! and Anew line  A1!</li>
    <li> Too much fragrance.  I couldn&#x27;t stay with it long enough to find out if it works.</li>
    <li> The best night cream for the price</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and am often mistaken for much younger than my age</li>
    <li> use this cream every night :)</li>
    <li> I like this but don&#x27;t use too much or it will feel oily.  I will use a little less.  I have used Avon for many years but this is my first try on this.</li>
    <li> I like the product.  It is very soothing to my skin and this is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered it.</li>
    <li> I used this night cream as well as the day cream for 3 days/2 nights.  It not only cause a horrible rash, but it burned my skin bad enough that I am now using Silvadene cream for treatment.  If you have sensitive skin, please think twice before using these avon products!!!</li>
    <li> I found this product is amazing, I have full trust in AVON. First, I used the night repair and day as well.  Now, I am using 7s night almost a week now.  I am quite happy and content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All women over 50 should use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faithfully,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Suheila (Sue)</li>
    <li> Smells good. May sting on your face if applying too much but that&#x27;s expected. Also using as day cream. Highly recommended !</li>
    <li> I love this item.  Good for my skin gives a smooth feeling.  Makes wrinkles less visible and face relaxed and shiny.</li>
    <li> Only been using for approximately 2 weeks, but so far I love this product.  My face appears to be so  much smoother &amp; softer feeling.</li>
    <li> I finally found a nightcream that works with my skin type (fair and thin).  My skin is smooth and soft in the morning.  Not too greasy either.  Great price compared to getting it from my local Avon lady.</li>
    <li> very soft and fleixable</li>
    <li> delivery in excellent conditions packaging and on time, perfect product (new) as described. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love using the Anew night cream.  It is a deep moisturizers that works along with prescription meds, and leaves my skin soft after cleansing,</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream for my mother-in-law (she loves this stuff!) It&#x27;s the original Anew cream from Avon, but much more affordable. Great product!</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with the Gold Emulsion at night and love the results I&#x27;ve gotten. My face, throat, neck &amp; all around collar-line have benefited greatly with this product and I hope it continues to keep my skin firm, soft and bloomingly fresh for many years to come! And what fragrance it does have is faint and pleasing - a win-win for this product - yaaa!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  It does what it supposed to do, and works better than other creams.  Avon makes excellent creams and other products.</li>
    <li> Hello, I ordered this product for the first time and really like it... I did have a problem though, with an air bubble in the middle of the container which left me with about one half a jar... It took up the entire middle of the jar... That was disappointing because I didn&#x27;t get my moneys worth.. It there anything you can do to correct this issue..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would really appreciate it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know as soon as possible....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heidi Makarem&lt;br /&gt;hondaheidi@hotmail.com</li>
    <li> Love it. Fast delivery. Cheaper way to by it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and am very happy with its consistency (non-greasy) and results.  I also use the corresponding Day Cream with SPF 25. Although I&#x27;ve tried several other skin care lines, I&#x27;ve returned to the Avon Ultimate line time and again, and feel they work the best for my skin.</li>
    <li> This product and the day cream are as good as any expensive creams.  Works great and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have been using Avon ultimate for years and my skin is perfect. No wrinkles, firm, springy and smooth. I use it with Neutrogena Age intensive serum and La Mer moisturizing cream. I have even stopped getting filler injections bc this stuff plumps your skin up so well, which is saying a lot bc I&#x27;m so thin. Bottom line, it works!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the Avon Anew 7s night cream actually I use it day and night. My skin is sensitive to some products so am very pleased that it seems to be working fine.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Have used it for years. Every time I tried to change I go right back. There is a day cream version with sunscreen - it is pretty good but I prefer the night cream. However when in much sun the day cream with sunscreen works well. But at night I still use the night cream. I am in my late 60&#x27;s and my skin is pretty good with few wrinkles -  and looks it&#x27;s best when I use this face cream.</li>
    <li> It seems to dry my face too much.</li>
    <li> Better price then the sale price through Avon.  I keeps trying much high priced products and I keep going back to this night cream.  It&#x27;s luxurious and smells great!</li>
    <li> I used this product ..and am at the end of the jar. Made no difference. I suspect seller is trying to pass off ordinary cream as Anew. I have used Anew before, purchased directly from Avon and noticed huge difference. With same product sold on Amazon, no difference at all. Buyer bewar</li>
    <li> I had read good things about this, it literally burns my face a total regretful purchase</li>
    <li> There is nothing like Anew for your aging face and neck. I will never use any other product on my 62 year old face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Avon skin products for over 30 years and this is the first product I&#x27;ve used that I wish I had never bought.  It burns my skin no matter how little I use, it&#x27;s created flakes in the creases of my nose and lids.  Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> I have used Avon products my whole life. This is my favorite of all their face cream products. Some have a not so nice fragrance and the Avon Booklets don&#x27;t say which face cream products smell and which don&#x27;t. And some of them are pretty obnoxious. This is fragrance free, easy to use, lasts a long time, and makes your face feel nice. I use it for daytime too because my skin is a very dry-type. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not working for men</li>
    <li> Immediately, actually two times after I used it, I noticed a difference on my face; a glowing effect on my face.  I love this product.  I had tried many others before I found this.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I bought it for her, she&#x27;s in love. She&#x27;s been using it for years and keeps buying it. I guess that means it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> Nice and light.  Not greasy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s taking it about 2 weeks but, I can see on my face, the fine lines are actually beginning to fade. And you can&#x27;t beat the price. My sister also noticed my face looking brighter and better then it was. Amazon has the best price on this product I might add, so if you want it, buy from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This night cream has great consistency, thick but absorbs into skin quickly.  Feel a tingle when first applying but stops within seconds. The price was great will purchase again.</li>
