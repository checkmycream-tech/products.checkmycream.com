      <li>Thanks for a great product!</li>
      <li>Good fit and speedy transaction.</li>
      <li>Super cute, fits great</li>
      <li>This is definitely cute, it&#x27;s not as slouchy as I&#x27;d like</li>
      <li>I was satisfied with the merchandise</li>
      <li>The shipping didn&#x27;t take long, and the price is perfect!</li>
      <li>I was worried about the company being from China but the quality was amazing and the fit is perfect, even a little stretchy if needed.</li>
      <li>Really that may be better.</li>
      <li>4 stars because it&#x27;s such a nice cap</li>
      <li>Overall pleased with it.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I wanted a second to wear while the first is drying after being laundered, but as I say it has never been received though many weeks have passed.  </li>
      <li>Very well made.</li>
      <li>The shipping from China takes a long time, and when I told them that the delivery date is really far away, they refunded me my money and gave me the cap for free!</li>
      <li>Though I had to get a new cap before this one arrived, but now since it&#x27;s here, I don&#x27;t mind having two!</li>
      <li>It is thick and warm and very well made.</li>
      <li>The braid on my first order came loose right away</li>
      <li>The hat was very nice except it was a little small for my head.  </li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ll just put it up all over social media that&#x27;s all.</li>
      <li>I never received this order, but I like the one I got from Susanstore a few months ago very much</li>

<li> Shipping took a few weeks</li>
<li> and I got tons of compliments this past winter every time I wore it.</li>
<li> Also I ordered another in black and it came but from a different vendor and smells so awful it cannot be used.</li>

<ol>
    <li> Love it! All my friends like it also</li>
    <li> Just to let the public know, I never got my purchase from Amazon.this braided hat, you may not want to publish this but it&#x27;s the truth. So I&#x27;ll just put it up all over social media that&#x27;s all. Really that may be better. That way everyone can see it and I can keep reposting it. I&#x27;m going to start looking for other places to shop and I will advise everyone I know to do the same. Post it or not I will. Cause I&#x27;m the one who lost out...</li>
    <li> I must have a big head, because thee is not enough hat for it to look like that pose in the picture.  Very well made.</li>
    <li> I was satisfied with the merchandise</li>
    <li> The beanie arrived just as pictured. It is thick and warm and very well made. Love it!</li>
    <li> Super cute, fits great and I got tons of compliments this past winter every time I wore it. I was worried about the company being from China but the quality was amazing and the fit is perfect, even a little stretchy if needed. The price was great, too! Shipping took a few weeks but I expected that. Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> The hat was very nice except it was a little small for my head.  I had to keep pulling on it to make it bigger.</li>
    <li> The shipping from China takes a long time, and when I told them that the delivery date is really far away, they refunded me my money and gave me the cap for free! Though I had to get a new cap before this one arrived, but now since it&#x27;s here, I don&#x27;t mind having two! Quality, Material, everything&#x27;s nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave 4 stars because it&#x27;s such a nice cap but I couldn&#x27;t get it in a little less time.</li>
    <li> I got this hat for myself, and I absolutely love it! I am ordering another one for my step daughter now! The shipping didn&#x27;t take long, and the price is perfect! I&#x27;ve already gotten many complements!</li>
    <li> Very cute. Exactly as described. Nice quality. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is definitely cute, it&#x27;s not as slouchy as I&#x27;d like but it&#x27;s comfy and looser than some of the other hats I&#x27;ve gotten on the website . Overall pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Shipping takes a while but it keeps my head warm and it&#x27;s cute!</li>
    <li> Love this hat!  It is just as the picture shows it to be.  Good fit and speedy transaction.</li>
    <li> doesnt look that good on</li>
    <li> I never received this order, but I like the one I got from Susanstore a few months ago very much, that&#x27;s why I ordered another.  The braid on my first order came loose right away so I removed it and one button and like it that way.  I wanted a second to wear while the first is drying after being laundered, but as I say it has never been received though many weeks have passed.  Also I ordered another in black and it came but from a different vendor and smells so awful it cannot be used.</li>
