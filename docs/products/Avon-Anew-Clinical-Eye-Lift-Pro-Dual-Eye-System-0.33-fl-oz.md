    <li> I love this stuff! Great product</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Seller responded with my shopping concerns. Very good customer service. Received product today. Came early than February. Tried some of the product, felt tight around eye area after it dried. A comfortable tightness like it&#x27;s working. Very good product. I will order again. :)</li>
    <li> Great product for lifting eyes and lids.</li>
    <li> i apply this both morning and night.  It really works for me.  I was purchasing two separate products to treat sagging eyelids and lines under eyes.  Discontinued buying the other two and using this 100% of the time.  Just ordered my third jar.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product</li>
    <li> Very happy with results...Best product out there for puffy, wrinkly eyes ! :)</li>
    <li> Seems to be old/out of date.  Both the cream and the gel seem old.</li>
    <li> I am shocked how well this product did with lifting my eye lids, and in such a short time. I was amazed.  I won&#x27;t go without it.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it works!</li>
    <li> great price, fast delivery</li>
    <li> I find this product helps with your  eyelids, keeping them firmer. and the white cream for the under eye  part of the product lessen the dark circles under your eyes.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says. Have used this for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never received this. But I&#x27;ve used this when I ordered the Avon and it does work</li>
    <li> I use this product every day and just love it.  Several of my family members are now using it as well.  I gave as gifts at this last Christmas 2013.  they all like it too.  I JUST LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Always like the clinical for the eyes works great tightens skin love it will be back to buy more soon</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Product works for me.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and very quick shipment.</li>
    <li> Avon Clinical line has always been one of my favorites.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and value.&lt;br /&gt;It is easily absorbed in the delicate eye tissue under the eye.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> The skin on my eyelids is almost like crepe paper...very thin.  Guess this happens when you get older???  Anyway, this is the only product I found that helps that area of my eye.  Use it at night and there is a difference in the appearance of the skin on the eyelid.  I stopped using it for awhile, not sure why, but could tell a difference.  So I highly recommend and for the price much better than high priced eye creams and I&#x27;ve tried most of them.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I noticed my upper lid was starting to sag, when so I bought this product, and it works very well.</li>
