      <li>and she always does a great job, but this last time she fried my hair.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m sooo excited to start using it again and can&#x27;t wait to get my lovely locks back.</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>I also color my hair and this keeps my hair so soft and easy to style.</li>
      <li>It works pretty well.</li>
      <li>Kerastase never fails me.</li>
      <li>Recently, I was looking at pictures from a few years back and realized my hair did not look as nice anymore these days and could not figure out why in THOSE pictures from those days my hair was so beautiful</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy more when this runs out.</li>

      <li>Earlier I had gotten the Bain Satin shampoo from Amazon and it was just fine</li>
      <li>If you use it per directions (s on your hair for about 5 min before washing off), your hair will actually turn out smooth with no tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Once in a while, a person needs Kerastase Mask Intense.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference in my hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it as a treatment, really, but as an every-day conditioner.</li>
      <li>I have straight hair and still have body using this product line.</li>
      <li>it really works it leaves my hair shiny condition and tangle</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping, Item as described</li>
      <li>Having said that, it really works well.</li>
      <li>I use regular organic, natural conditioners now and although I have to use more every use, it still does the job</li>
      <li>Having fine hair I am always on a quest to find a product that will make my hair manageable and not make it flat.</li>
      <li>it does miracles on fine dry hair...</li>
      <li>my main concern, is the product itself is not what it should be.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product if you have damaged hair and need something to help repair it.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s a little more moisturized when I wake up.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair which has been breaking due to coloring it.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you choose the correct masque (fine or thick hair), I made that mistake once a long time ago...</li>
      <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is a little more thicker, she wears her&#x27;s natural</li>
      <li>Highly recommended and works better than the other deep conditioners!</li>
      <li>Does amazing glazing job, smoothes all the dry hair, not greasy, does not weigh my hair down.</li>
      <li>This is way more expansive than your usual l&#x27;oreal or pharmacy product...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can tell the great result after the first time using this magic product. I just love so much and I can&#x27;t leave without it!</li>
    <li> Having fine hair I am always on a quest to find a product that will make my hair manageable and not make it flat. This product fit the bill. After washing my hair, I put a little (about a quarter size) on my hair which is mid length. I also color my hair and this keeps my hair so soft and easy to style. I will definitely buy more when this runs out. I have a few friends who I am also going to share this product with.</li>
    <li> Love Kerastase products!</li>
    <li> I bought Kerastase as my friend recommended it. I had moved to a very dry city and my hair was going out of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually felt that it worked very well. If you use it per directions (s on your hair for about 5 min before washing off), your hair will actually turn out smooth with no tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gripe with this product is that it&#x27;s a rather small container and the price of it is a bit exorbitant for conditioner. Also, the product is not cruelty-free which is important to me. Having said that, it really works well. I guess in this case, you get what you pay for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably won&#x27;t purchase this again unless another dire hair situation comes up. I use regular organic, natural conditioners now and although I have to use more every use, it still does the job right and the cost is fractional to what Kerastase sets me back. I&#x27;ve also started putting almond oil on my hair before I sleep so it&#x27;s a little more moisturized when I wake up. When I actually remember to do this, my hair feels pretty awesome without having to spend a fortune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My take: If you have the money to spare, buy this. It works pretty well. If you find the price ridiculous, there are other less convenient remedies to get around the dry hair issues.</li>
    <li> Like the name suggests, this conditioner is best for very fine hair. It isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I would like, but seems I have thicker/drier hair than I realized. Works well when I use a lot, however. I don&#x27;t use it as a treatment, really, but as an every-day conditioner. I was interested in this product because I would like more volume, and using this product doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all which is nice. I may try the Masquintense for normal/thick hair after this is gone, hopefully as a moisturizing weekly treatment.</li>
    <li> I ordered this online because the price is so much better than in a salon. Great product for over treated hair. I have straight hair and still have body using this product line.</li>
    <li> This product smelled and felt like hand lotion. It did not untangle hair and made hair feel course. My hair dresser suggested this and it worked nothing like she stated it would. SAVE YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> My hair is dry and thinning and is subject to harsh cold weather daily. This stuff makes my hair feel like hair again. Its so silky smooooth:p</li>
    <li> The best hair treatment in the world...it does miracles on fine dry hair...i wish theyvwould sell it everywhere and not have to order it all the time</li>
    <li> If your hair needs a now and then, super heavy duty conditioner, this is one of the best intensive conditioners I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Once a week, after shampooing, I massage this cream throughout my hair, keep on for twenty minutes and then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;It has a wonderful silkening effect. It isn&#x27;t heavy and you only need to use a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;I know it is very pricey for a conditioner, but for damaged,dry hair, this is a wonderful intensive repair treatment.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasant and overall, a great product.</li>
    <li> Great product! My curls became so soft and beautiful after applying this cream :-)</li>
    <li> I know its pricey for a conditioner buy great price on Amazon, in the store it is over $60. This conditioner makes my hair very full and healthy like I am a movie star : )</li>
    <li> I have tried some of the most expensive hair treatments and this is the best. I recently had my hairdresser give me the Brazillian Blowout and she always does a great job, but this last time she fried my hair. I tried all the expensive hair products to keep my hair from breaking off and to repair the damage. I had to cut some of it off. I read about this stuff and thought that I would give it a try. It is so good. I love it. My hair looks so much better and this is after just one use. My hair has body and shine. I will be using this product and plan to buy the shampoo and anything else that Kerastase​ makes. I highly recommend this product if you have damaged hair and need something to help repair it.</li>
    <li> This is way more expansive than your usual l&#x27;oreal or pharmacy product...but there is a reason for that; it works!! It will cure your hair and help fight the friziness. I have straight blonde died hair that frizzes like crazy if I don&#x27;t flat iron or at least blow dry them. I use this product twice per week with KMS California tame frizz; no need for flat iron or ion blow dryer; my hair is not frizzy anymore!</li>
    <li> I usually love Kerastase and I bought this one thinking it would be great for fine, dry, curly hair but it&#x27;s not emollient enough. The Oleo Relax mask is much better and well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I love this product&lt;br /&gt;And finding it on Amazon was a pleasant surprise with a great price&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair feeling silky, smooth and shiny</li>
    <li> I color my hair for gray roots - I have curly/frizzy hair and always need to condition it.&lt;br /&gt;This changed my hair for the better after only two shampoos!</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly. It costed half prize of the pharmacies. Kerastase is awesome. I have been using it for years and my hair becomes softer and brilliant after using it. I do recomment costumers to buy it.</li>
    <li> Does amazing glazing job, smoothes all the dry hair, not greasy, does not weigh my hair down. Works great with hair spray, or mousse, will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> A few years back I had a hair stylist that insisted I buy this product because my hair was dry, brittle, and lacked shine--and although it was expensive I trusted her. I ended up loving it--my hair was silky, shiny, the color (blonde) was vibrant and it did not weigh down my fine limp hair. I did not ever pay attention to the name--just knew where it was on the shelf and the color of the bottle, and just picked it up once every few months when I got my hair done. The salon I was going to closed and my hair stylist moved and I also moved out of town. I did not remember the name of the product or where else to find it so I just stopped buying it. Recently, I was looking at pictures from a few years back and realized my hair did not look as nice anymore these days and could not figure out why in THOSE pictures from those days my hair was so beautiful--then I remembered that I had been using this crazy expensive masque that was in a cream and orange bottle---that&#x27;s all I remembered but after searching online for a masque in an orange and cream bottle that was crazy expensive I found it!!! I&#x27;m sooo excited to start using it again and can&#x27;t wait to get my lovely locks back.</li>
    <li> This is a great product but pretty pricey for conditioner.  I found this at a great price and I was really happy with it.  It made my hair really soft and it has a nice scent.  I thought the jar was really small for the price but surprisingly a little goes a long way.  I would definitely purchase this again.  Kerastase never fails me.</li>
    <li> I really did think this was fake. It does smell just like baby lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have fairly thin hair that tangles easily after washing and this conditioner keeps that from happening. It leaves my hair soft, shiny and smelling nice. It&#x27;s not cheap, but it only takes a small amount to get the job done. Also, I don&#x27;t use it daily. I use it every few days and use regular conditioner on the other days, but can tell that my hair seems healthier.</li>
    <li> Kerastase has great hair products for all types of hair.  For thin/fine hair this particular hair product does not leave your hair flat or oily.  This gives you shine, lift and moisture....</li>
    <li> Once in a while, a person needs Kerastase Mask Intense.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing conditioner. After shampooing I towel dry my hair and apply the mask and keep it on for at least 15 minutes. The results are amazing!</li>
    <li> A good once a week masque for thin, baby fine hair that is processed.  Keeps damage to a minimum.</li>
    <li> I used this product for my fine hair about twice a week. It leaves it full and healthy looking. If you have fine hair and style with blowing or heating iron, I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just simply...great product. Recommended  by my hair salon and it&#x27;s perfect for my hair.</li>
    <li> love it!!!!!!!!! THis product is great!!! recommend to any hair type. buy with confidence and enjoy superb results and beautiful hair!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, Item as described</li>
    <li> Highly recommended and works better than the other deep conditioners! I have fine hair which has been breaking due to coloring it. This has really helped it stay strong and smooth. It has definitely improved the texture of my hair.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t make any difference! Had to use an ordinary one.... :(</li>
    <li> I have bleach blonde hair that is damaged. After using shampoo, and then using this product my hair felt smoother and healthier. I put enough to saturate on my towel dried hair, put my hair in a shower cap, blow dried for about 10-15 mins and then washed it out with amazing results. Best results will be seen if used once a week for couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I used this product on my hair just once and OMG, my hair is sooooo soft.  I am very happy with my purchase.  My hair feels so soft and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is Afican American fine grade.  I would recommend this for all.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is a little more thicker, she wears her&#x27;s natural (As I do), I&#x27;m going to recommend this product to her too.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking to hydrate your beautiful locks, then this is the product for you. It&#x27;s better than Pureology or Aveda or any other expensive hair product I&#x27;ve tried. Simply the best!</li>
    <li> The absolute best when you have extremely dry or damaged hair. It literally will change your life. I have double processed platinum blonde hair and use this religiously. People always comment how beautiful my hair is. Just make sure you choose the correct masque (fine or thick hair), I made that mistake once a long time ago...</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for my hair which is long length, medium textured, and moderately damaged. My hair, after multiple applications, was left noticeably coarser and rougher.  The shipping and customer service was, however, just fine - no problems with that.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love it cause I don&#x27;t see much difference in my hair. Their products are usually really good, wondering if they changed the ingredients or something. Be aware of the strong super strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;They ease brushing the hair, that&#x27;s a big plus, you can do that in the shower.</li>
    <li> Even though the box had been tampered with [on the bottom the numbers were scratched out and then painted with white out, also the box insert had been removed, in addition the box lid was torn), my main concern, is the product itself is not what it should be.  I have weaved but very short hair and always use my hands and hair dryer to dry it.  After using this conditioner, my ends are dry and a bit tangled and my fingers get caught in them.  Also, as has been my practice, I apply a small amount at night before bed when my hair is dry. It doesn&#x27;t feel conditioned and silky as it always has in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Kerastase Masquintense for fine hair for years (in fact since it was introduced) so I know how my hair feels with it.  It is an excellent product!  Earlier I had gotten the Bain Satin shampoo from Amazon and it was just fine so I thought the conditioner would be as well.  I have used this product on several occasions to make sure that there really is a problem with it and each time has been the same.  I don&#x27;t know why this conditioner is different……..perhaps it is old???</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  Kerastase always makes my hair feel so soft and healthy.  I just wish that it wasn&#x27;t so expensive....</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Made my hair look healthy again</li>
    <li> it really works it leaves my hair shiny condition and tangle free its consistency is wonderful i definitely recommend it thank you</li>
