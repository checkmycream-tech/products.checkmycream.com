      <li>My experience with Protege Flawless Scar &amp; Blemish Treatment has been amazing.  </li>
      <li>It had great reviews but did not work for any of my problems, redness and acne scars.</li>
      <li>This seems to be a great company.</li>
      <li>This gel is great smooths</li>

      <li>Did not get to receive this product, but am sure it would have been wonderful</li>
      <li>i read all of the wonderful reviews and was confident I found an amazing product...</li>
      <li>I can see the difference after using it, the product is good.</li>
      <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t say it smells good either.</li>
      <li>So when I was offered this Scar Gel from Protege Beauty for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I had to order and try it out.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t try it again for this price just good for a week.</li>
      <li>My scarring does look lighter, so that&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>
      <li>I used to quite dislike my face without makeup - because of how discolored the scars were on my relatively fair complexion.</li>
      <li>I really loved this stuff</li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>Does not work well as described andnot even good quantity for price.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with the results after one month.  </li>
      <li>well the awesome yummy smell makes up fo its look, smells like fresh apples to me.</li>
      <li>It even feels good going onto my skin and does not cause any sort of irritation, and it smells nice.  </li>
      <li>they are all excellent quality and live up to their awesome product names :) Flawless is helping leave my face looking more flawless over time :) Ive been using it for about a month now on some old acne scarring and it has reduced the scars by about 60%!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d put Flawless first then apply this after 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I love you Protege! &amp;#60;3</li>
      <li>I love being scar-free!</li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>I put on flawless first, waited 10~15 minutes before put on Luminate and</li>
      <li>but I am pretty happy with the results!</li>
      <li>I love this cream!</li>
      <li>This Product has Excellent Results since first use ..</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it!  </li>
      <li>I am ABSOLUTELY in love with this stuff!</li>
      <li>After reading positive reviews regarding the Protege Flawless product, I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product twice a day for about 5 weeks on acne scars and it has worked amazingly on those.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been so happy with my skin and felt as comfortable without makeup.</li>
      <li>but this stuff is amazing</li>
      <li>so if the claims made are as amazing as the results im seeing I will be thankful.</li>
      <li>I was hoping, after reading the reviews, that it would be amazing, but it just didn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
      <li>This is a nice scar gel.</li>
      <li>I received this to share my honest thoughts and opinions on this product.</li>
      <li>This was impressive to me and I am thankful for their fast and effective customer service.</li>
      <li>/&gt;*I received this product in return for my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>Thanks again FLAWless!</li>
      <li>Fading nicely</li>
      <li>I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
      <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work.</li>
      <li>When I went back to the doctor yesterday, he was so excited and thought that the scar guard was working wonderfully, until I told him I was using Protégé Flawless.</li>
      <li>I just hope its worth it for the prize!!!</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product, it is absolutely wonderful.  </li>
      <li>It goes on very easily with no odor.</li>
      <li>The customer service is excellent and they consistently keep up with you to make sure you are really enjoying their products.</li>
      <li>So far this stuff seems to be working great!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love that it&#x27;s kind of chunky because I can&#x27;t wear it during the day</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many creams ect for my acne scars but nothing helped, my sister gave me to try this amazing cream</li>
      <li>The best way to describe the smell is &amp;#34;chemical,&amp;#34; which leads me to think this may not be as natural of a product as the company claims.  </li>
      <li>and I especially love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
      <li>Took about 2-3 months for great results, my skin is SOOOO much smoother!</li>
      <li>will order more to see the result :)</li>
      <li>I just ordered my second Flawless.  </li>
      <li>I tried Flawless along with Luminate starting 01/25/2015.</li>
      <li>Its been 1 month or more, and still no resutls.</li>
      <li>I took some pictures and if they look okay, I&#x27;ll post them..before and now.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how many acne scar products I&#x27;ve used that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I stopped using it and its gotten better now.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It seems to be diminishing the marks I am using it on. The only thing is that the consistence of the cream is weird and a little hard to work with. But I am mostly happy with the results I am seeing.</li>
    <li> In all honesty, I purchased this product with expectations that it wouldn&#x27;t work. I was totally wrong, as after using it for several weeks on a dark red spot on my leg, the spot has disappeared. I believe that the red area was caused by a spider bite, and it had remained unchanged for well over 3 months. The bottom line is that this product works as advertised; just be prepared to use it for a minimum of 3 weeks to see results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks and I absolutely love it!  My surgical scar is becoming less prominent and my acne scars are diminishing as well.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Nope didnt do anything at all. I bought it with Luminate but only Luminate worked. Flawless actually has flaws.</li>
    <li> So far I don&#x27;t know how this works but when it first arrived I respected it to be a bigger tub but it is VERY small. Not worth $40 worth, but this is my last option as far as reducing the appearance of my scars. I&#x27;m going to take before and after photos to see the end result. so if the claims made are as amazing as the results im seeing I will be thankful.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything and the bottle is so small like a  lip balm</li>
    <li> Use this on my face and so far loving it it does look kinda weird but its a great product and the smell pretty decent and not smelly</li>
    <li> I have been using it at night before bed regularly. After struggling to control acne for years, this product has both controlled my acne and has faded the scars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months and still no results on my acne scars :l</li>
    <li> Okay product. Using on chin for tweeze scarring from years of hair growth. Noted lightness though.</li>
    <li> I started using this product at the same time as a couple other new products and i definitely saw my skin improving, especially the redness. It wasn&#x27;t until I ran out of this that I knew this was what was making all the difference! I really loved this stuff and I especially love that it&#x27;s all natural. I don&#x27;t love that it&#x27;s kind of chunky because I can&#x27;t wear it during the day but I&#x27;ll take the chunks for the results! It comes in a smaller than expected bottle but it lasted me quite a while. A little definitely goes a long way. This seems to be a great company. Love the emails before and after receiving the product. I have since purchased the vitamin C serum and illuminate. Hoping I receive as great results and I did with this!</li>
    <li> the consistency is annoying but it does work</li>
    <li> I would not buy again because I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my face after using 1 complete little container. it is not worth it at all, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I am glad I found this product. I had discoloration &amp; acne scars on my face. This product works great!</li>
    <li> Helps with pimples but not scars</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for bout 2 weeks, on a 6 month surgical on abdomen and older facial scar. The abdominal scar has definitely faded snd does not feel as tight. I actually end up putting this ll over my face at night, underneath their Pumpkin enzyme oil. My face is pretty darn smooth! I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Not sure it did anything with my scars but my acne cleared up.smells alittle funky.</li>
    <li> I tried this for one month and didn&#x27;t notice any improvement.  They do have great customer service.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  After many years of fighting adult acne watching my once smooth skin change to one with acne scars and raised red marks, I am delighted to say that I have seen enormous improvement in old cystic acne scars and the reduction in redness in newer scars.  I have only been using this product for about 5 days am very excited to see how much better it will look after a few weeks.  I have tried numerous scar creams and gels and have never seen these type of results.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me after 2 weeks</li>
    <li> I was asked to write a review for the Best Scar Gel - FLAWless. I am still using this product. It goes on very easily with no odor. Stay posted!</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell the full benefits but seems to help with the dark spots due to acne scarring and beginning to notice a smoother surface around scarred areas</li>
    <li> Though I did not take before and after pictures, I have noticed a difference. I cut my head open in my scalp right at my hair line (pretty deep cut, probably should have got stitches).  Once it closed over I purchased your product and feel as if it is beginning to heal faster and lighten to my skin tone slowly but steadily. I intend to purchase another bottle once my first supply is up.  I try to use it twice a day, but I&#x27;d say I use it once a day about 3 days a weeks and the other 4 days I use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> Used for over 6 weeks and have NOT had any slight or dramatic difference in my scars.  This product is expensive, I was hoping for the best, but VERY DISAPPOINTED and so upsetting.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product. Can&#x27;t even get a refund, due to their short return policy!</li>
    <li> I was hoping to be able to give a 5star rating for this product but unfortunately I saw absolutely no improvement at all. I used it as directed religiously and waited until I used the entire bottle to submit my review. I won&#x27;t be reordering this product. It had great reviews but did not work for any of my problems, redness and acne scars. I would have been happy if I had seen even a slight improvement.</li>
    <li> It works to a point then after that you don&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
    <li> use the whole jar and still no see different</li>
    <li> bought the scar treatment due to positive reviews.  Unfortunately, this was not the scar treatment I expected .  I used it on two fresh shallow scars on my face near my mouth for three weeks.  There was no improvement.  I don&#x27;t know why it was rated high on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was doubtful anything would help lessen the appearance of the scars on my leg but Flawless did just that.  After 30 days of using Flawless the appearance of my scars has faded significantly and I am confident with continued use they will soon be barely visible.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m loving this product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work,  just a waste of money, energy and tIme</li>
    <li> very good product I&#x27;ve seen improvements hard to believe in as little as two days on fresh acne scars. only con is the smell is not very pleasant. Its a small container but not much product is needed for an application so i can see it lasting long.</li>
    <li> I am such a fan of all of Protege Beauty products! they are all excellent quality and live up to their awesome product names :) Flawless is helping leave my face looking more flawless over time :) Ive been using it for about a month now on some old acne scarring and it has reduced the scars by about 60%! it makes me wish i had taken before and after pictures to be honest :( I&#x27;m planning on using this gem on my stretch marks after the baby comes in november *fingers crossed it works as well on those tiger stripes as it did on my face!* love love love this product, goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and there is no greasy residue! I love you Protege! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> i dont really see that much of a change, and i think it&#x27;s bit over priced</li>
    <li> Not only did I not notice a difference on my 4 small scars from Laparoscopic surgery, it left stains on my clothes, even when I let it dry - which takes a while.</li>
    <li> I’m trying out Prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; Flawless in combination with Prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; Luminate. What I’m hoping for is a brighter, flawless complexion. The Flawless comes in a 1 oz. brown glass bottle with a pump dispenser. It is a creamy, brownish serum. I’ve been applying it all over my face, neck, and a scar on my chest. I’ve only been using it for 2 days…it can take up to 4-6 weeks for very noticeable results. I do like the moisturizing aspect and how it makes my skin feel. Sample provided for evaluation and review purposes. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This has significantly improved my skin. I have a lot of small acne scars on my cheeks that have almost completely gone away. It definitely improves redness as well. I would recommend this for anyone who has struggled with acne and the scars it has left behind. It does take some patience to see the changes. I started to notice how soft my skin was from using this and then soon my marks started to disappear/fade. It is important to use it twice a day like it says because this will speed up the process of improving your skin. I&#x27;ve always had terrible skin and when I started my freshman year of college I had one of the worst breakouts. I try almost anything and everything to improve it. I used to see a dermatologist, but that became too expensive really fast. I haven&#x27;t finished the whole bottle yet and I&#x27;ve already noticed this much improvement. I will definitely buy a few more. This improves the quality of your skin so much! I&#x27;ve never been so happy with my skin and felt as comfortable without makeup. THANKS SO MUCH! Acne and scars used to make me feel so self conscious, now I can just be me!</li>
    <li> I just received a couple of days ago.  It feels and looks like it works, but time will tell</li>
    <li> Ineffective on scarring even with faithful use for 5 weeks left me breaking out like I used to on my forehead chin and cheek</li>
    <li> This is a nice scar gel. It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot as a lot goes a long ways. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell to it which is nice. I like how it doesn&#x27;t have any added chemicals and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I have  very sensitive skin so I have to be careful what I use on it and haven&#x27;t had any issues with this product. I have been using it on a few scars on my hands from IVs and they have really helped my scars start to fade and with more use I expect them to completely disappear. It doesn&#x27;t work over night but over time it does. I received this to share my honest thoughts and opinions on this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Cleared up rash overnight.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh this stuff is fantastic. I had a total knee replacement, and it has done wonders with that huge long scar. It was thinner and paler in 2 days, and gets better when I remember to use it regularly. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I bought two of them. It doesn&#x27;t work for me. My face is even worse with more acne.</li>
    <li> Within the first week or so, I saw the raised scar above my lip start to flatten. After the third week of use, it seemed like the gel lost its initial scent and consistency. Since then, I have seen no improvements. It&#x27;s unfortunate. I was looking forward to it working, after reading the ingredients.</li>
    <li> No real results after using the whole bottle</li>
    <li> I dont really know if I want to put this stuff on my face. It came without a seal and color is not the same as other people&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I noticed no improvement so disappointed</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I actually won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a bad product because it could have worked for someone else, but it did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff really seems to work! I&#x27;ve been using it on a couple of areas for several months now and have seen significant improvement in my scars appearances. I even used it on an incision area, post surgery, and it made the scar from that almost non existent. I wish I had know about this stuff before - I bet it would work great on the incision area from my c-sections. Definitely will continue using!</li>
    <li> Took about 2-3 months for great results, my skin is SOOOO much smoother! I had acne scars from high school that I thought I&#x27;d never get rid of, so pleased with this product I&#x27;ve already gone through 3 of them so far. I&#x27;m going to keep using till my face is perfect!</li>
    <li> This product has given me great results!  The first two weeks i did not see any difference but i think by the 3rd or 4th week i saw the difference in my scars and pigmentations!!!!  Just dont give up!  This product also doesnt seem to break me out.  I use this everynight after i washed my face and in the morning when i wash my face.  I also notice that it helped reduce the redness in my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ I REALLY RECOMMEND you guys to purchase the Indian aztec healing clay.  It works wonders!!!!! Its been so long since ive seen my skin this clear.  This plus the Flawless serum definitely is a double threat to those stinky acnes!!!!!</li>
    <li> Did not work one bit for my darker acne scars. Used entire bottle. Oh well.</li>
    <li> So I used this for 1 month straight twice a day with Luminate. I&#x27;d put Flawless first then apply this after 5 minutes. NO EFFECT NO CHANGE WHATSOEVER. Waste of time. I am returning it. And don&#x27;t be fooled by the reviews posted here as 90% of these reviews are posted becuase Protege gave them the product for free trial / discounted. They promise you can see results after 3 weeks. Then after I sent them a complain they say that it might take up to 8 months.</li>
    <li> I used most of the container and my scars never got better. To give them credit, my scars are several years old and deep. Hoped for some improvement but got nothing. I used the recommended 3 months for older scars. Guess I just need to do what everyone has advised and get fillers.</li>
    <li> I used this product on my face for acne scars and nothing changed. Sad, I wasted $30.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many creams ect for my acne scars but nothing helped, my sister gave me to try this amazing cream and all I can say  is that this is  magic in a little jar! I could see results with in 3 weeks, I had acne scars and dark spots..Now they are almost gone after 1 month....I love this, I will buy more!♡</li>
    <li> A little gritty? Not sure if it&#x27;s just mine; also have to shake it a lot to &amp;#34;mix&amp;#34; it before using....not sure if anyone else had this problem?</li>
    <li> Did not work. I used it every day like stated for my acne scars and I saw no result.</li>
    <li> I thought i had rosacea on my nose, it would always get red and puffy all the time, I went to the dermatologist and he confirmed that it indeed was. I figured my dad and his brothers had it too. I thought it was pimples or zits so I would try to pop them only to find out I couldn&#x27;t, leaving this really bad dark scars behind. I couldn&#x27;t deal with it anymore it got so bad to the point I could not go out in public with out a band aid covering the big red shiny bumps it would create on my nose. I tried changing my diet and it worked but I could not go on longer than a week depriving myself from my favorite foods. As soon as I this certain food it came back. I looked up reviews online trying to find creams that would help reduce my rosacea and the dark scars it left me. This cream would pop up everywhere in every website I would go on. I saw it was also really cheap compared to this other creams that aren&#x27;t any cheaper than $80. I bought this cream 2 weeks ago and been using it ever since. My nose has not turned red at all since, I have not gotten any of the big disgusting bumps I used to get and it has reduced my dark scars slowly. It has also helped my skin looked younger since it used to look really dry and wrinkly from upclose due to all the previous acidic creams and lotions my doctors would prescribe me. I recommend this cream to any person who has rosacea and has a bit of money to spare, I believe it is worth a try since I took a gamble buying it and it has paid off. I will update this review if anything changes.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. I have acne prone skin and I had a bad reaction to it. My pore clogged and I battled terrible acne on my cheek after that. However, the seller Protege Beauty deserves a 5 star rating for their outstanding customer service. When I purchased this product in December 2014 it came in a small 1 oz container, not what looks now as a amber glass spray bottle (probably better that they redesigned this) since as someone said it looks like fruit juice. I expected some sort of cream but although it looks gooey it has worked for some people based on the reviews I read here. I contacted the seller letting them know I had a bad reaction to the product and I was immediately refunded the $27.77 I paid at the time and I was given a 50% off code off a different Protege product to try. This was impressive to me and I am thankful for their fast and effective customer service.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product and so far I am liking the way it feels on my skin</li>
    <li> It did nothing for me. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Did not get to receive this product, but am sure it would have been wonderful</li>
    <li> Not sure how long does it takes to make my face better.&lt;br /&gt;the package wasn&#x27;t like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;I still have the scares on my face and they are not deep&lt;br /&gt;it can be fix not sure how long it would take.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotta say that I love this product.  I have olive skin and anytime I get a pimple or a blemish and pick at it, it always leaves a scar that takes forever to go away and when I say forever, I mean several months.  I have had these couple of marks on my face for months now.  They&#x27;re so embarrassing and annoying because it&#x27;s right on my face.  I got this scar and blemish remover to try to help.  At first when you open it, you can smell that it has a strong smell to it.  It&#x27;s not bad, just strong initially.  Once you put it on your face, or your skin, you don&#x27;t smell anything.  It has a pump.  I just pump a tiny bit and put it directly on the spots, and pump more as I need it.  I&#x27;ve been using this since the day I got it, August 6th, and it is working.  It doesn&#x27;t disappear over night but it gets lighter and lighter.  The instructions say give it a few weeks.  I took some pictures and if they look okay, I&#x27;ll post them..before and now.  Like I said I&#x27;ll keep using it until it goes away.  I&#x27;m using it on other little spots too, here and there on my body and it&#x27;s helping as well.  I&#x27;m so glad to have this product, especially to help with face blemishes and marks.  I feel more confident now that they&#x27;re getting lighter and going away.  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed Ive been using it about a week &amp; I&#x27;m seeing results already</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 4 c-sections and there&#x27;s always a scar left behind. Well it&#x27;s low enough that my bikini hides it but I&#x27;m still uncomfortable about it. So when I was offered this Scar Gel from Protege Beauty for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I had to order and try it out. So I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and a half now and there is some fading on the edges of my scar. I&#x27;m gonna keep using it for  a while and can&#x27;t wait to see how much it&#x27;ll disappear! I definitely recommend this Scar Gel from Protege Beauty for anyone who wants to help fade a scar.</li>
    <li> Ive always had acne marks , this cream was the best thing ive ever used i truly recommend it ! You&#x27;ll see results in less than 2 weeks for sure!</li>
    <li> Beautiful cream.  Love it</li>
    <li> .. This Product has Excellent Results since first use .. I Love it .. Highly Recommend . !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really hoping this work&#x27;s!!!,Check the size,1oz. before you pay as much as I did,(smh).</li>
    <li> Great Product ! It works!</li>
    <li> I just can say that I am impressed. I saw results in two days. It erased old acne marks that I treated for many years with other products such as Clean and Clear mark treatment which only burned my face and did not work well. But this product is a miracle. I am astonished how do you do it?</li>
    <li> I’m so thankful I found this cream!  I have an assortment or ugly scars on my knees from various bumps and scratches, and I’ve had a few acne scars that have bothered me since I was a teenager.  This cream is the first thing I’ve found that actually gets rid of them!  It blends into my skin well, and I started noticing scar reduction in just a few weeks.  It even feels good going onto my skin and does not cause any sort of irritation, and it smells nice.  I love being scar-free!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since the beginning of January since my face was pretty scarred because acne and it has helped so much!! My face is almost scar free. There&#x27;s a bit left but my skin is ridiculous and it takes forever for something to work on it so I blame it on my skin. I also only used it once a day instead of twice so that probably is a reason why it took a little longer. But it seriously works!  I wish I had taken a before picture so I could show the difference but this stuff is amazing and I would totally recommend it to anybody.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this nasty scar on my arm since I was a kid. Finally it&#x27;s starting to disappear a little bit. I really do enjoy this product and recommend you try it for your needs.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several weeks on a scar which is only about a month old...on my inner elbow. I have not noticed any change whatsoever. Also it kind of stings a little, but that could be due to I am using it in a sensitive area (my inner elbow where you get blood drawn). The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me but I wouldn&#x27;t say it smells good either.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any different in any aspect of my scar. Its been 1 month or more, and still no resutls. I am veryyyyy constant with my skin care. I applied twice a day. But still i am using it.. I  waiting!!</li>
    <li> So far this stuff seems to be working great! No complaints, only that I need more ㅎㅎ</li>
    <li> It came on time! Not sure yet if it&#x27;s work or not! I just started yesterday to put it on my scars.... I just hope its worth it for the prize!!! Because is too expensive for a 1oz. Jar</li>
    <li> ok so at first i was looking at the color and texture of this product and was tbinking yuck. well the awesome yummy smell makes up fo its look, smells like fresh apples to me. now i tried it on my strech marks on my stomach. i tried it as suggested, it is invisible and is absorbed fast into my skin and over the last week my strech mark is smoother and not as pink looking. i love this stuff and will be getting it again.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for 3 weeks and already I have seen such an improvement in my skin.  It has already evened out the blotchiness in my 58 year old skin tone, which I didn&#x27;t think was possible, and given my skin a youthful glow to boot !!  Finally, a product that really does make a difference.  A very special thanks to all the Amazon reviewers whose recommendations got me to try this.</li>
    <li> It did not work at all. I used it exactly like the instructions said and I saw no improvement whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I love this cream! I bought it for my husband who has acne scars on his back from going untreated when he was younger and I can already see an improvement on his skin. The cream does have a orange/mustardy color and to me is smells sweet like honey, but not too overpowering. The customer service of this company is Amazing!!! I definitively recommend this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I just received this product yesterday came in two days.  So far I love the pump bottle I used it last night on my face (needs more time for scars) and it feels nice. Will review in a few weeks or so to see if this works.   It&#x27;s been a few weeks and I see a slight improvement. I think people need to be patient and try it longer. I am almost out of mine. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I see results after 3 weeks. My acne scars went from black to a medium brown. Fading nicely</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see a difference thus far. Maybe I need to give it more time, but I would have expected to see a little improvement after a month of use.</li>
    <li> I have a few small acne scars that have bothered me since my teenage years, and a burn mark on my arm from my curling iron that happened just recently. I&#x27;ve been using this scar cream on them for about 3 weeks, and I&#x27;ve noticed a slight improvement in the depth of the acne scars (which I&#x27;ve had for 10+ years). But my biggest surprise was the burn mark on my arm. Before I started using this cream, the scar was red and raised. It has now faded to a light pinkish beige color and feels smooth to the touch. It&#x27;s not completely gone but, almost 80% improved. I plan to continue using this cream until there are no signs of it left. I&#x27;m amazed at with the results!</li>
    <li> After some unfortunate incidents with a level 4 acid peel, i found myself with some very heavy scars. Some ice pick scars and a very bad burn on my right cheek. My once flawless skin was destroyed. I honestly thought i would never be the same. I tried every facial product cheap and expensive. I was horrified to go out in the day time and dreaded passing a mirror because my face was unrecognizable to me. I happened to come across this product and decided to try since the reviews raved about it. I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work. All i can say is WOW. Within one week my face has had a dramatic change. The scars are shallower and almost gone. It gives me hope and confidence again. Well worth $30. I will buy again. For those of you with ice pick scars or old acne scars. Try this you wont be disappointed. Thank you for changing my life and giving me my confidence back.</li>
    <li> Well, So far I have used about a quarter of this product, I think I see a very slight difference in my indented scars. I was expecting better results. I am not sure if I got an expired product because the product seemed to be a little coagulated, I am not sure if it was supposed to be like that. I am using it as directed on the bottle so far, and I will continue to use it until I use up the entire bottle, and give an updated review.</li>
    <li> so far so good give update after the 60 days of use</li>
    <li> This stuff works very well. I had the unfortunate experience of acquiring some dog bites on my face back in July 2014, my face healed pretty quickly, but there were still some dark marks that remained after healing. I have used this stuff every night before bed on the remaining blemishes and they have really lightened to almost unnoticeable. I plan to keep using it in hope that the remaining scarring will disappear. I have not tried it on old scarring, yet, but can attest that it works well for recent scarring.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me. I was hoping, after reading the reviews, that it would be amazing, but it just didn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel for about 3 days and can honestly say I have been noticing slight improvement... I have used SO many products from doctors, stores, home remedies dangerous bleaching creams, and recently even started going on birth control to fix my acne and acne scars... I usually have a new breakout every morning and I haven&#x27;t lately and my scars are starting to turn light pink than brown. It&#x27;s only been day 3 so let&#x27;s see how the rest of the week goes!</li>
    <li> its been a week dont know just as yet .</li>
    <li> I have used for 4 days now and i have notice my stretch marks fading.It ruds in very good.It not real greasy feeling and the smell isnt bad.I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This is very much like fruit puree.  I like it.  Don&#x27;t eat it though.</li>
    <li> Did not work for made me break out completely</li>
    <li> I am on my second Jar and cannot say that I notice much difference in the appearance of my scars from old blemishes on my face. I will continue to use till this jar is complete.</li>
    <li> Waste of my money. It doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t expect for this mini jar but lets see what happens when I start using the product.</li>
    <li> this is very good good flawless</li>
    <li> I can see the difference after using it, the product is good. The company should offer a bigger presentation, 1oz is not enough.&lt;br /&gt;O.M.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed on the size! Was not even enough for me to start seeing results, did not even last me one week. I did not rebuy. It might be a good product but to bad the size is not encouraging.</li>
    <li> It costs too much and only lasted for 2 weeks. My scars have only improved a little bit.</li>
    <li> This product does not work on scar as stated</li>
    <li> I feel like its working out slowly</li>
    <li> Not working at all and i got more skin trouble after using it. I stopped using it and its gotten better now. All reviews seem to be false</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen a vast improvement with scarring</li>
    <li> I really have seen quite of an improvement when purchasing this product. In matter of fact this is going to be my third purchase! I have been using this every morning and night and have been doing so for about two months. Of course the scars I have on my legs do vary depending on the length I have them but I am pretty happy with the results!</li>
    <li> I love this product so far. I have truly been seeing some results. I have only been using for about two weeks. I can&#x27;t wait to see the finished results</li>
    <li> I am at the end of my first jar of Protege Flawless and have seen absolutely no change in my scars.  Of course, I haven&#x27;t seen any changes after years of Mederma either so I guess I&#x27;ll just keep on keeping on and hoping for some lightening eventually!</li>
    <li> Does not work well as described andnot even good quantity for price. I am a caramel brown complexion and had got the product for a burn mark on my chest. All I needed it to do is remove that dark spot along with other dark marks that I have from scars and it did not do so. Marks are still dark with little to no fading. I also was going to use for surgery scar but that seems pointless since it could not remove a few of acne scar dark spots.</li>
    <li> We see no effect so we stopped using. Sorry! Shipping and customer service wise, is great! It&#x27;s the product itself we dont like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream 2 times a day for four weeks and it hasn&#x27;t had any affect on my scars.</li>
    <li> I just ordered my second Flawless.  This is an awesome product, and I can definitely see results after using this for 3 weeks, I can&#x27;t wait to see what the next 3 weeks will do.  I have been playing the blemish game for 44 years, and it has not been fun!  This product is giving me hope.  I would highly recommend this product, it is absolutely wonderful.  Thank-you Protégé.</li>
    <li> This is so mall!! I finished this cream in a week just use on my tummy! I can&#x27;t tell any different before and after. I won&#x27;t try it again for this price just good for a week. The cream size like my eye cream. past!</li>
    <li> I love this product! it has reduced my acne scars and has reduced acne for me. I approve this product and guarantee it provides results - Erik :)</li>
    <li> I tried this cream for a couple of weeks with no positive results only made me break out for some reason, it just wasn&#x27;t compatible with my skin. I purchased it originally after having four moles removed from my face and I thought it would help lesson my scars but no such luck... My search will continue to find something else that will help...</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any change either way.  It&#x27;s very sticky, and the smell is odd&lt;br /&gt;Not any improvement whatsoever.  Like throwing money away.</li>
    <li> For years I have struggled with acne.  It chased me through my teen years, and was an unwelcome guest in my early 20&#x27;s.  Now I have reached the point where I have finally banished pimples from my life!  Unfortunately enough, the ghosts of acne&#x27;s past still haunt me with their ugly scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a multitude of products..facial peels, chemically ridden dark spot removers...all with the same end result: irritated skin, with no relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protege Flawless is made in The USA, it&#x27;s not tested on animals, and the ingredients are not harsh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scar cream contains natural ingredients that are soothing and beneficial to new skin growth.  This is not going to create over night results, but will over time reduce acne (and other) scars drastically.  I apply a thin layer to scarred areas on my face, and it goes on gently, does not burn or irritate my skin.  I have been using it for 2 weeks and notice that my scars are finally fading away.  Be sure to use a moisturizer with SPF before venturing outside for your daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product in return for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I assume this is helpful for scars but Scarguard is the way to go. Check out Scarguard and with commitment and patience you will know you are using the best product out there.</li>
    <li> I just ordered my 3rd flawless blemish scar gel and my second skin lighting cream and I added the exfoliate mask after reading the reviews from people who have used it. I am a black light- skinned woman with yellow undertone. Anything leaves a scar on my skin so this little gel and cream is doing such a great job lighting the dark spots. I also scrub 2 times a week and used both products in the dark area. I put the gel first and I rub it dark spots after 2-3 minutes I repeat the process with the cream on top of the gel. I absolutely love the products.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product twice a day for about 5 weeks on acne scars and it has worked amazingly on those. I also just recently had to have a surgery that left me with a scar on my face. My doctor recommended scar guard, but I decided to see if this product would also work on this scar. I have only been using it on my scar for about a week, twice daily, and the improvements are amazing! When I went back to the doctor yesterday, he was so excited and thought that the scar guard was working wonderfully, until I told him I was using Protégé Flawless. He was shocked. Needless to say, he is actually recommending this product over others now!</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying the product. I have seen some small changes to the scars. But nothing significant yet. I would certainly consider buying again.&lt;br /&gt; I trust that the product is natural based off the smell, color and texture. I use it every time I get out shower.</li>
    <li> After using this product for just a week it has reduced the appearence of dark scars from acne,  and I haven&#x27;t had a single breakout since using this product, ☺😊☺😊☺😆☺</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel very soft and smooth, I havent used it for long, but I hope it will help with my scars. will order more to see the result :)</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for 2 days, &amp; I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference!  Following one of the popular B.P.O. treatment systems, my acne prone complexion was left with a couple of deep scars and areas of discoloration, in addition to being more acne prone than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already noticed the redness and discoloration starting to fade, and one of the deeper scars has already began to shallow.  I&#x27;m hopeful that continued results will be as astonishing as the initial results.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product.  Awesome warranty.  Thank you.  You may have literally saved my life.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the results after one month.  My facial acid scars have lightened as well as softened my complexion.  Altogether with a notieable an also decrease of pore size,  I use less foundation and concealer.  I can now apply day and evening moisturizer with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the look, scent and consistency of the product.  It looks like mashed cooked yams and smells like butternut squash...lol  But, surprisingly, it works into the skin fast with little residue.  I can feel a slight tingle when I apply the cream after Derma Rolling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue I have is that there is no tampering seal.  It arrived in the jar that is pictured,  individually  boxed with no inserted directions.  As soon as the jar is open, you immediately see the contents along with  some spillage on the lid due to the absence of a sealer :(</li>
    <li> Been using for a week and can already see some fading in my scaring.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Flawless about 3 weeks on a surgery scar.  I started using it 10-11 weeks after surgery.  I also decided to give it a try on a patch of spider veins.  I did notice some immediate reduction in the redness in the healthy skin around the scar.  The scar itself has continued to fade.  To be fair I am using other products as well - vitamin e lotion, Scar Away, Amlactin, eye cream, whatever is around - to keep the scar moisturized.  So I&#x27;m not sure what exactly is doing what for the scar, but I&#x27;m giving a second jar a chance based on the immediate reduction in redness around the scar and some minor lightening in the spider veins, because Flawless is the only product I&#x27;m using there.  I wish I had taken pictures to compare to.  For those asking about appearance, it reminds me of a darker, jelly-like, cinnamon applesauce.</li>
    <li> I did not see any real results.</li>
    <li> I am ABSOLUTELY in love with this stuff! I&#x27;ve always had acne scars and sensitive skin. This stuff within a week started fading my scars but also, evening my skin tone. Feels great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin! I don&#x27;t know how many acne scar products I&#x27;ve used that didn&#x27;t work. FINALLY one that does! Also, this 1oz jar lasts me about a month! DEFINITELY worth getting!</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  I have been using this product for over a month and there has been no visible improvements.  I took before pictures and compared pictures from 1 month later...disappointed.  i read all of the wonderful reviews and was confident I found an amazing product...Nope!</li>
    <li> I have only used it a few times. I need to use more consistently for results. No skin reactions though</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase a scar remover treatment in order to lighten eczema-related scarring on my lower leg that has lingered since childhood.  After reading positive reviews regarding the Protege Flawless product, I thought I would give it a try.  The consistency is disgusting, the color is gross, and the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; is an odd fruity-type scent that isn&#x27;t pleasing by any means.  Every time I open up the jar, there is a very unappealing product inside.  Nonetheless, I went ahead and began using it and after only a few weeks, I have noticed a small difference.  My scarring does look lighter, so that&#x27;s a good thing.  However, I think my product has already turned stale!  I have closed it tight after each use, but it seems to have changed.  It looks the same, but the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; is now completely atrocious!  There&#x27;s not a trace of that barely &amp;#34;fruity&amp;#34; scent anymore.  It has turned into a putrid smell, and I almost can&#x27;t even bear to use it.  It seems as if almost overnight it turned from barely fruity to entirely unbearable.  I can&#x27;t even put my finger on what it smells like now.  The best way to describe the smell is &amp;#34;chemical,&amp;#34; which leads me to think this may not be as natural of a product as the company claims.  I&#x27;ve rated this two stars only because it seems to have done something for the better, but I am going to switch to another product.  This is much too expensive for it to turn stale so quickly.</li>
    <li> Worked! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  I have to say that it worked and just wow! I thought that the scar was going to stay forever. :( I seriously was worried being that I love wearing skirts and showing my legs. The scar was about 8 inches long too. Thankfully this worked with the use as directed. Thanks again FLAWless!</li>
    <li> I have some blotches on my skin that I really want to get rid of as well as a few scars from surgery that I would like to do lessen. I&#x27;m hoping this product will do everything that it says. So far it feels really good on my skin I have only been using a few days but the redness of my scars seems to be getting a little bit lighter.</li>
    <li> A little hesitant to purchase this product at first. Struggled with acne since puberty and haven&#x27;t been able to get rid of it. Due to constant picking and popping my face has become discolored and the scars are almost as bad as the actual acne itself. This product has evened out the skin tone and really lightened those unsightly scars. A little pricy but you pay for quality and this is definitely a top quality product.</li>
    <li> My experience with Protege Flawless Scar &amp; Blemish Treatment has been amazing.  After contacting Protege, a customer service rep named Stephanie was extremely helpful and quick to respond. I am pleased with their customer service and I look forward to their replacement jar</li>
    <li> It was alright but not great.  It didn&#x27;t help my problems</li>
    <li> I see some difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Flawless for about a month and I do see a slight improvement. Hopefully this will continue until the scar is completely gone.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t look spectular but it&#x27;s been working like a charm. I&#x27;ve used 4 of these bottles thus far and the results are great. I&#x27;m using it to treat malasma and my daughter is using it to treat acne spots. It works well for both of us.</li>
    <li> Have been using this cream for about a month now and have not seen a lot of improvement. Not giving up and will continue to use it until it runs out.</li>
    <li> At first it seemed to be helping, then I started to break out again.... Could be just that it&#x27;s pulling some impurities.... Anyways, I&#x27;ll keep using it hoping I Get back to &amp;#34;The Helping&amp;#34; side of it.... Kind of a strange, brown, Gooy  texture for a cream, but if it can clear my skin I really don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s donkey poop.... I&#x27;ll try to give u a update</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell but I bought this item based on the company&#x27;s 365-day guarantee.  This is important to me as I have spent too much money only to be disappointed with other products. It&#x27;s a tiny jar (very tiny) and the product has a color much like brown sugar, has no smell with a consistency much like Dr. Sheffield&#x27;s scar gel which I think is onion-based, an ingredient known to be effective in many scar gels. The difference is Dr. Sheffield&#x27;s product costs $1/tube at the Dollar Tree vs. $28 for this product. Certainly, due to the size of this jar, and the fact that it may take up to 6 weeks to see any result, a 2nd jar may be needed so budget wisely depending on what you think the treatment might require (size and age of the scar, etc.).  Follow up review in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Daughter wanted it but I have no idea her thoughts</li>
    <li> so far, I have not seen any difference</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this faithfully for months now. I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference in the discoloration of my scars. I had some lesions removed on my face and I have 2 small, red scars. I began using this about 2 weeks after my procedure and the stitches were taken out. I haven&#x27;t seen too much improvement, but a little. And I&#x27;m not certain it is because of the product or natural healing, either. The cost, however, is much cheaper than other options out there. What I don&#x27;t like is how it seems to stain the skin, slightly with an orangish hue. And it has to dry completely, like for 30+ minutes, before you can apply makeup. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do any good to my skin! It was a waste of money. Besides, the bottle is much smaller then it looks on the picture</li>
    <li> This product is fake.The bottle is too small compared to what I expected.</li>
    <li> I am 48 years old and have been fighting about acnes for the past 30 years. There are several long time dark acne scars on both side of my face. I tried Flawless along with Luminate starting 01/25/2015. After about 2 weeks, positive results started to show. at about 1 month, by end of Feb, 2015, the scars faded significantly, and size also shrank. I just finished 6 weeks of treatment now. I am very happy with the result. I will continue using them and hopefully the can be totally eliminated and my face can be truly flawless.  Thank you for a wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them twice/day.  I put on flawless first, waited 10~15 minutes before put on Luminate and another 10~15 minutes before other cream or lotion.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. Used it twice daily.</li>
    <li> This gel is great smooths the face scars wrinkles etc disappear in a short while best gel out there great low price too thanks so much</li>
    <li> I was at first confused why the jar was to tiny but I came to realize that it was a quality over quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already notice that my complexion is a little more smooth which is huge for me because I&#x27;ve tried tons of products in the past with no luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have old acne scarring for highschool and I&#x27;ve been using this product after the shower before bed and someone commended that my skin looks great (which never happens)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously I don&#x27;t ever expect new skin in a bottle because that&#x27;s completely unrealistic, but noticeable change to my very poor skin is a good start!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only with the jar a bit  bigger!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a promotional discount which does not weaver my opinions.</li>
    <li> Not satisfied... didnt see a change at all...</li>
    <li> My recent scars from cat claws are gone!&lt;br /&gt;Other scars from past surgeries are taking a very long time.</li>
    <li> After just three days I&#x27;m noticing huge improvement to my deep acne scars on my forehead. It&#x27;s worth $30!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the type of person who has to wait weeks/months to give a review! But this product has worked so quick that I&#x27;ll give my input. I started using this two weeks ago and lord it is genius! I had a severe breakout in April and now I&#x27;m still dealing with the scars. I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING cheap and expensive and I was going to give up hope but I decided to give this a try. In two weeks I have has seen a dramatic change in my skin. Yes it&#x27;s going to take some time for them to go away completely but I pray this continues to help. I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars now because it&#x27;s only been a few weeks. A must buy!!!</li>
    <li> Just ordered this a couple of weeks ago ready to try! Has anyone else&#x27;s cream turned brown? I am very curious as to what the problem is. The temperature of this product has been normal, and looked normal when I recieved it. I was looking forward to using it so I may try to order a new one in the future when I have an extra 20 something dollars lol!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this product to really work, but I dutifully applied it to my old acne and injury scars out of habit twice a day. I realized results would take a long time (especially with how old my scars were), but I still didn&#x27;t have high hopes for them. I had tried other products before - expensive &amp;#34;spot diminishing serums&amp;#34; and whatnot without a significant breakthrough.&lt;br /&gt;And after several weeks, with much surprise, I noticed this great scar I had near my ankle (that looked like a weird cigar burn) - the texture of it was becoming rather smooth. It was so strange. And within a few more days of application, its distinctive color started to fade. Of course the severity of this wound will probably mean it would never fully disappear, but I&#x27;m quite proud with how it&#x27;s progressed.&lt;br /&gt;It was only around then that I started looking more intently at the areas I had been applying the treatment to on my face. And I had realized my old acne scars were slowly fading too. Especially that horrible area on my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very grateful, of course. I used to quite dislike my face without makeup - because of how discolored the scars were on my relatively fair complexion. Now it doesn&#x27;t really bother me anymore... which is such an amazing sentiment to be able to express.&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is probably not documenting the progress ahead of time - as I heard this small company sends you a complimentary product with the pictures. I&#x27;m not much of a product reviewer, so I didn&#x27;t really plan ahead accordingly... Pity.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 4 weeks! I had deep acne scars. Give it a try! It may or may not work for you because keep in mind everyone&#x27;s skin is different. But there&#x27;s no hassle if you give it a try. The company values its customers and stands behind them 100%. The customer service is excellent and they consistently keep up with you to make sure you are really enjoying their products. I can&#x27;t thank them enough for their time and effort! THANK YOU FLAWless customer service!!!!</li>
    <li> It seems to bebworking for my acne blemishes and gives my skin a better look and feel.</li>
    <li> Flawless to early to tell if it&#x27;s helping yet maybe another 2 weeks more thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using FLAWless for almost two weeks now and it&#x27;s working for me! I have small spider veins that were purplish in color. Now they are pinkish! It made them much less noticeable! Also I used it on some os my scars and they are flatter and less noticeable. And I also saw freckles starting to fade near the scars too!  I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day. I highly recommend it!</li>
