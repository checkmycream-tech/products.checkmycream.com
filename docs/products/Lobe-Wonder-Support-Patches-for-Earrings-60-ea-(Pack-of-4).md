<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They work good with studs. im not sure how it would look with dangling earrings due to that they will be visible</li>
    <li> These do add a little more support while wearing heavier earrings.  They are a little hard to peel away from the backing.</li>
    <li> This Product Works Well For Light Earrings However Heavier Earrings Still Look Bad. The Alterntive Is Expensive Plastic Surgery. This Will Buy You Time And Am Still Glad To Have The Product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn earrings 24/7 for all my life (30 years). This definitely prevents further damage to my slightly worn earlobe holes while preserving the integrity of my current earlobe status. I only wear these with heavier earring styles.</li>
    <li> They are very helpful as I can wear any type if earring &amp; it still looks nice! I don&#x27;t have to undergo surgery</li>
    <li> Someone told me about these &amp;#34;Lobe Wonder&amp;#34; patches and they work well.  I was going to have surgery on one ear for an elongated hole but these patches work well and I will not have to have surgery.</li>
    <li> These are great for post-backed earrings! I have one ear that was pierced much lower than the other and it was always painful to wear heavier earrings on that side. These are great for heavy earrings with a post back (you can barely tell you have an earring in), but aren&#x27;t quite as good for fish hooks (still pulls and feels fairly heavy). However, I would definitely recommend them!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without these!</li>
    <li> these are so good for people who have ripped piercings.  They work wonderfully well</li>
    <li> I love my new Lobe Wonder Earring Support Patches.  They work so well to keep my ear lobes from stretching out further, and now I can wear any size earrings, which I love too!</li>
    <li> I had bought this product from a retail shop earlier for my Mom. She had almost stopped wearing earings, as her hole gotten really big and was difficult to hold on to the earings. With this, she has found a new love for earings and now almost all the ladies in my family wants one. This time around I bought 4 of them and already have orders to get 4 more.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what I need it to do and at a reasonable price. It is so convenient to get it through Amazon.com and have it on auto delivery.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It prevents heavy earrings from tearing my ears more, I wish I had these 20 years agos, they are a must if you like to wear big earrings!</li>
    <li> This is a good alternative to having your lobe repaired. Works great with post earings. I can wear earings I have not been able to wear in years. [[ASIN:B001ET77GQ Lobe Wonder Earring Support Patches, 60-Count Boxes (Pack of 4)]]</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t do without these Lobe Wonder discs now.  They came quickly, and I will continue to order them as needed.</li>
    <li> I found these a few years ago and they definitely make a difference if your earring holes are a bit stretched.  Will definitely continue to use them :)</li>
    <li> Have been using them for years and I love them, plus this company had the best price and free shipping will definitely buy from them again.</li>
    <li> When I found these on Amazon, and read the reviews, I was really excited because I have slits for ear piercings in my lobes as a result of foolish, wild dancing back in my college days, wearing heaving earrings.  Who knew!  Since getting the Lobe Wonders, I&#x27;ve been able to wear a lot of my earrings that I haven&#x27;t worn in a long time b/c I was self conscious about how they looked hanging so low on my lobes.  Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about that at all and I love being able to wear all of my earrings with confidence!  I definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, and I didn&#x27;t even know they existed! They stay on for days, and I even shower in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my earring holes is really stretched, so this is a great &amp;#34;until&amp;#34; but I&#x27;ll eventually need to get surgery to close them up.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the lobe wonder just wish I could find it in stores.</li>
    <li> I cannot live without the Lobe Wonder!  I usually double them since my ear is torn pretty bad.  (My son did it at 5 months old!)  they last on your ear 3-4 days even in the shower!  I keep a supply of these in my travel bag and on my bedside table!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect solution to my problem of not able to wear heavy earrrings. Compared to the cost of surgical repair, this is inexpensive and easy. This is truly a lobe wonder.   k.john  Austin,TX</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for anyone who has problems with their ears, damaged lobes, etc.  It has helped to keep my ears from more damage.  They also don&#x27;t show (on caucasion skin)when wearing most hair-do&#x27;s.  Good job Lobe Wonder!</li>
    <li> Having an earlobe that has always been in a stretched condition causes one earring to be much lower than the other. Discovering these earlobe patches allows me to have my wire earrings to hang at equal lengths from each ear.  I ordered 4 boxes this time so I won&#x27;t run out too often. I think that they are great! However, I do have trouble occasionally securing the patches on the back of my ear in the proper location to push the earrwire through the patch.</li>
    <li> Great item, have used for years!</li>
    <li> The patches work well, very pleased with them.</li>
    <li> Okay I first saw these on one of those home shopping channels.  I was immediately curious! The trick to these LOBE WONDERS is that you MUST LINE the patch up with your hole! Make sure your ear hole is in the middle of the patch.  Then pierce the patch with the earring (as you would normally put in an earring). Don&#x27;t be afraid to apply some pressure!! Try to go straight in and avoid going down and in at an angle.  These do have a learning curve!!! I almost gave up on these patches, but I persevered none the less. AND BOY AM I GLAD I DID! I was beginning to shy away from those large bold earrings I love so dearly, until I found these!!! Now, they do remind me of that medical tape you can buy over the counter. The tape is somewhat transparent and has little dots on it. I am sure it would be far less expensive to buy the tape than these patches, BUT I love the convenience of these...already in the right size and ready to peel off and place! DO NOT hesitate nor be put off by the negative reviews.  Always remember that not everyone is on the same level of awareness or know-how...not everything is meant for everyone! :)</li>
    <li> These are awesome.  They stick really well to my ears and they stabilize heavy earrings.  It&#x27;s nice when a product really works!!!</li>
    <li> I was really not sure if these would work or not.  But I am happy to report they do work.  My ears are pretty stretched out but when I wear these, my earrings don&#x27;t look like they are pulling on my ears.  I do recommend taking them off at the end of the day since the adhesive is very sticky and it could irritate your ears if you are sensive to adhesive.</li>
    <li> Works in holding up heavier earring without pulling on the earlobes.  At most maybe can wear a set for 2 days, so can go through one pretty fast if you wear heavier earrings every day. I tend to alternate or give my earlobes a break.</li>
    <li> Since my ear lobe was mostly torn at age 16, I was not able to wear earrings that sat or hung straight in my ears for many years.  Finally, I found this item, which I had no idea existed.  When a jeweler recommended them and gave me some, I literally cried.  I had always felt so uncomfortable and non-feminine because I could not wear beautiful earrings like other girls.  It always hurt me deeply and made me very sad.  The first time I put in earrings, using these lobe stickers, my earrings looked like a normal girls earrings would.  I cried right there in the jewelry store.  That was more than 15 years ago and I have been using these faithfully since for my right ear lobe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are clear stickers that have texture on them.  You peel off one sticker for the back of your ear lobe and place it on, then put your earring through it.  Because it&#x27;s textured and very sticky, it NEVER comes off, only in the shower, or unless you peel it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not bandaid painful sticky : )  They are moderately sticky so there is no painful removal.  They peel off easily when desired and they are effortless to put on.  Great product!  I could not live without these.  Although I only wear post earrings still, it&#x27;s better than nothing.  Now I don&#x27;t have one ear lobe with a hanging earring that looks lopsided or one that disappears into my ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these to anyone with a torn lobe, you will be so glad you found them.  They are wonderful.  A box lasts me about 2-3 months usually.  I really thank this company for inventing this idea.  It has given some of my self-esteem back, I couldn&#x27;t live without these.</li>
    <li> Amazing and easy to use - great for those of us that wore really heavy earrings over the years and our earlids are slit. Simply stick these on the back of the lobe , insert earring through the fabric and earrings hang where they should in the ear!</li>
    <li> the best invention since sliced bread!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love these things !  They really help support heavier earrings.</li>
    <li> Wife says BlingGuards are much better--worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These will do in a pinch...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--RayB</li>
    <li> The Lobe Wonder is the answer for those of us who wore all those long, heavy, dangled earrings so long that they lengthened the holes in our lobes. With the Lobe Wonder placed on back of the lobe creating much needed reinforcement, we can still enjoy our big earrings. Great invention.</li>
    <li> If you have stretched out ear piercings like me, this is the perfect solution. They are completely comfortable on the backside of your earlobe and completely invisible.</li>
    <li> I bought and point to all it has a Great time and credibility. can trust</li>
    <li> They worked like magic.  Can wear any earrings now....really glad to find.</li>
    <li> I love the support lobe wonder gives my earrings and keeps my holes from becoming more stretched out.  I highly recommend this item!</li>
    <li> This product really does what it says it does.  I have very low holes in my ear lobes &amp; these enable me to wear longer &amp; heavier earrings than I would have without them.  I would recommend these to anyone who has problems with ripped or enlarged earring holes.</li>
    <li> Without these, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to wear a lot of fashionable earrings.  Before I discovered these, I wore a lot of post-type earrings or clips.  Now I can wear wire-types and heavier ones.  Only problem is that sometimes they are a little difficult to correctly position on the lobe.  Once they are on though, they stay put all day (and through the night).</li>
    <li> After years of babies pulling on my earrings I was left with a torn earlobe.  I had it stitched back and the ear was then re-pierced.  Unfortunately, only a few years later the hole became a slit and my earring would hang so low that people would constantly tell me my earring was going to fall off. I discovered Earlifts and loved them, but became disappointed because there was hardly any adhesive on the last few boxes I had ordered.  Last month I tried Lobe Wonder and am thrilled! What a pleasant surprise to have a product meet up to it&#x27;s expectations!!  Don&#x27;t hesitate ordering this product!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. After years of stretched lobes I am loving product. Please dont ever stop making them.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! I can wear heavy ear rings all day and my ear lobes don&#x27;t feel like they are being pulled or stretched.</li>
    <li> They work very well for any situation, in case you have a large ear lobe hole or if you need to hold a heavy earing in place. I can&#x27;t live without these patches anymore...</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for, love my earrings, after years of wear, some too heavy, lobe was torn, this corrects the problem in seconds, lasts all day!</li>
    <li> They make all my earrings look so much better. They sit upright on my ear and prevent pulling and drooping.</li>
    <li> I have tried several ear supports at much higher prices. The Lobe supports are much easier to use, faster, stay on the ear and support your earrings well. I have one ear that is streched and doesn&#x27;t support heavy earrings ,without looking like my ear lobe is going to tare.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the amount of patches I received for the price. I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> If the tapes were thicker, they would be more effective, especially in keeping heavier earrings from drooping.  I find I have to double up on each tape. The box is also awfully big for the tiny product inside; that doesn&#x27;t seem economical to me.  The box could contain at least three of the packs.  For what the item is, it seems expensive.</li>
    <li> these work ok. I have been using them for years now. When I first started using them, I could use one and be done, but now, to get the hold I need, I have to use two. The adhesive doesn&#x27;t seem to stick like it used to. Hope they go back to the original formula, otherwise, its still good to use one for a light earring like pearl studs or some flat posts.</li>
    <li> I had consider cosmetic surgery before I heard about this product.  This product is so wonderful.  I purchased a box for my sister.  I can now wear my favorite earrings.  Awesome product.</li>
    <li> The ear lobe wonder are my new best friend!! They are awesome for heavier earrings. It takes the stress off the earring hole and it doesn&#x27;t hurt when you wear heavier earrings. I recommend this for anyone and everyone![[ASIN:B001ET77GQ Lobe Wonder Earring Support Patches, 60-Count Boxes (Pack of 4)]]</li>
    <li> For years I had to wear clip on earrings because of a stretched ear lobe. Usually the attractive clip ons were so heavy that within a couple of hours I had a headache. The Lobe Wonder allows me to wear beautiful pierced earrings again!</li>
    <li> I have used both EarLift and Lobe Wonder. Both are equally effective. I find better pricing with Lobe Wonder.  Has allowed me to continue wearing large earrings but I refrain from them being too heavy more often than not.  Love the product and will continue to purchase when I get low!</li>
    <li> A very simple solution to a nasty problem for those who love oversize earrings that are a bit heavier on the ear lobe!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about these pierced ear hole patches.  I have been using them for 10+ years.  I couldn&#x27;t live without them!!</li>
    <li> If you wear big gaudy crazy earrings and your lobes are sagging and hanging on for dear life, this is the product for you</li>
    <li> Used them just twice but I have one ear love that gets infected and has almost torn through.  But I think I will be able to wear earrings without worrying.</li>
    <li> Best kept secret for heavy earrings- every girl needs these!!</li>
    <li> These are great. I&#x27;ve been using them for years. When I use them, I can wear really heavy earrings that I would steer away from in the past for fear of too much pulling on my earlobes from the weight. I just use two patches for each earlobe, one in the front and one in the back. Sometimes, I cut them in half to save them if I&#x27;m running low, and they still work just as well. I would highly recommend these if you do not want your earrings to pull and drag on your earlobes.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products! I love wearing big earrings that are heavy and this product allows me to wear them comfortably. The sticker takes the pressure off your earlobes so you don&#x27;t have to worry about your earlobes splitting. If your earrings are really heavy you can even double up the stickers and it provides more protection. I would recommend this to all fashionistas!</li>
    <li> flimsy and doesn&#x27;t hold.  I have used the old version for years and they are so much better.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> The lobe wonder was delivered quickly. However the lobe wonder did not work for me and now I am left with all these boxes.</li>
    <li> These little babies actually work wonders. I still have to watch what types of earrings I wear, but they do help with holding earrings in place without the hanging or pulling.</li>
    <li> This product its Amazing!!!! Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> My ear lobes have been torn for decades (back in college in the 80&#x27;s, I wore cheap, heavy earrings, not realizing that I was allergic to the nickle in the metal, and the constant irritation wore away at my piercings and I now have barely any \\&quot;lobe\\&quot; left.)  I discovered Lobe Wonder at a jewelry party 8 years ago and have used them every since.  I can finally wear stud earrings again, as well as nickle-free wires.  I LOVE them and wouldn&#x27;t go without them.  They will stay attached for 2-3 days, even with daily showers and hair-washing.</li>
    <li> I buy Lobe Wonders 4 boxes at a time.  I&#x27;m never without them and I use them every day.  I thought I would never be able to wear all my one-of-a-kind pierced earrings ever again because my pierced ears were so torn looking.  What a relief to find this product!  I am now back to wearing all types of earrings thanks to these simple-to-use adhesive tabs.  I tried other products that actually use an earring backing to put on, but they were so hard to use.  These are so simple!  Make sure that when you put your earring post or wire in that you put it at the top of your earlobe hole so that the tape will do its work, especially with wire earrings.    I&#x27;ll never use anything else again and I tell everyone about them.  They&#x27;re good even if you are just wearing heavy earring and you don&#x27;t want to destroy your lobes!</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my wife who has worn pierced earings for a long time and suffers from the holes in her ears elongating and causing pain.  These support patches have been effective at relieving the pain and holding her earrings perfectly in place.</li>
    <li> Excellent wish I knew about these years ago</li>
    <li> I love these...I&#x27;ve re-ordered twice.</li>
    <li> Loved it.  This is one product that actually does  what it says it could, when following the instructions properly..  Also helped to save a lot of money from having  ear lobe surgery performed, you can use this method instead, which is not painful. if you have a drooping earlobe, the support patches supports the damaged lobe, so that you can still wear any type earrings.</li>
    <li> Lobe wonders really do work!  They work especially well when wearing heavier earrings or wire earrings keeping them from falling out.  I give these as little gifts to my girlfriends and they love them.</li>
    <li> Great deal for ear lobe patches, I was overpaying and buying these at Kendra Scott.</li>
    <li> While simple in concept, the design nonetheless does the job.  I have an enlarged pierced hole in my ear (thanks to my daughter who loved pulling my earrings when she was a baby). Earrings don&#x27;t sit right on that ear and often someone will tell me I am about to lose an earring.  This product creates a tough and invisible and sturdy back to your earlobe that allows you to choose where along the pierced hole the post should pierce the lobe. From the front, the earring sits in the right spot on the earlobe. The patch lasts till the next vigorous shampoo or even longer.  Tough little patch.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  Wear any earring with ease and comfort.  Holds in place even for heavier earrings.  I would recommend this product to all.</li>
    <li> This is great because you can wear earnings again if your lobes are stretched a little.  They are easy to use too.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I have ordered these. Work wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I have bought the Lobe Wonder for years.  My ear lobes have stretched over the years and these seem to help.  I was sorry when Bed Bath and Beyond quit carrying them.  I am glad I found them on the internet.</li>
    <li> I use these daily to keep all earrings in the correct location and from pulling down in the ear lobe. As a young women of the 60s and 70s, I wore trendy but unfortunately heavy earrings that have pulled my ear holes. Surgery is expensive and quite a process to repair the lobe, so I have opted for Lobe Wonder. It does the trick and there is no &#x27;healing&#x27; time</li>
    <li> While I am usually the last person to write a review about anything, I felt this product deserved it.  I have been using Lobe Wonders for years and don&#x27;t know what I would do without them.  When my son was an infant he managed to pull my earings often and hard enough to where the piercing stretched ALOT.  I had quit wearing wires totally and had to make sure my posts were supported with the big wide circular backs.  With Lobe Wonders I am back to wearing any kind of earring I want.  I would be devastated if they quit making them - consequently I buy multiple packs at a time.</li>
    <li> If you have any type of stretched piercing on your ears, these are wonderful.  It allows me to wear studs without fear of losing them.  They sell them at Walmart, but they were cheaper here.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I have a few pairs of earrings that I had always hesitated to wear because they were so heavy, and because my left ear already has a slit that was accidentally stretched a while ago, that I am fearful of the heavier earrings because I didn&#x27;t want them to tear thru.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I now have no concerns, really. These little stickers work to keep the slit from tearing, and as directed to insert the earring at the top of the slit, it actually doesn&#x27;t look like I have an elongated slit at all when I use them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to &amp;#34;cheat&amp;#34; and just use some medical tape to mimic what these ear lobe stickers do, but the regular tape is not as able to accept the earring piercing through it, which means that the developers of these Lobe Wonders took their time to figure out just the right combination of tape strength with ease of puncture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely keep buying this product, as it now makes it possible for me to wear my favorite dangly earrings easily and without concern for tearing through my ear lobes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m regularly purchasing these earing support patches. They help hold heavy earrings in place. I love them, can&#x27;t imagine what would I do without them. They keep my earlobes from stretching and earrings remain in perfect position. Love them.</li>
    <li> I love big dangly earrings but over the years my pierced earring holes have stretched which makes wearing this  type of earring unsightly and often times painful. I really looked forward to receiving the \\&quot;Wonder Lobe\\&quot; product as a way to solve my problem. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. In short, they did nothing at all to alter the appearance of my stretched earring holes or to offer any measure of extra support for the heavier earring styles that are currently in fashion.  Perhaps, if the patches were a little more substantial (I.e. thicker) they might work better. They are not costly enough to make it worth my while to return them but, I definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing them again. I guess I&#x27;ll have to resign myself to wearing tiny lightweight earrings until a better product comes along.</li>
    <li> Best thing next to getting my ear repaired.  Thanks for coming up with these, I fear doctors sewing on my ear so this is a lifesaver for me!</li>
    <li> I had never heard of this before ordering it on Amazon. This product is great! I use it almost every day. And one pair of patches stay on for days....!</li>
    <li> very helpful. I am 69 and my holes are a little big for earing&#x27;s that hang. These solved the problem without people seeing them.</li>
    <li> it does not support the earings weight. It is just a piece of tape. An expensive piece of tape. i am returning them</li>
    <li> I have been using Lobe Wonder for 8 years and cannot live without the product.  I was in a state of panic when I could no longer order from the company direct, thank heavens Amazon.com came to my rescue.  The self adhesive stickers support any earring, therefore no more \\&quot;drag\\&quot; on your lobes!  They are so easy to use, just peel off and stick it behind your ear, insert your post thru it with a little support from your fingers and the earring will sit high on your lobe.</li>
    <li> I have one ear that has a somewhat stretched out piercing hole from wearing heavy earrings. My daughter found these Lobe Wonders for me and I wear them everyday now! They support my earrings and keep them from drooping. I usually only cover the stretched earlobe, but if I do wear more weighty earrings then I cover both earlobes for support. They are a godsend, and the price at Amazon is great.</li>
    <li> I love that I found these!  My ears are almost split and I couldn&#x27;t wear normal earrings.  I can wear any earrings I want now.  I&#x27;m not into the heavy earrings at all.  But, it would handle them nicely.  Now, after about a day or so, they start sliding around and aren&#x27;t as sturdy.  But, you just switch them out and start over again.  That&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> If you have this earring...challenge, and haven&#x27;t used Lobe Wonder, you are truly missing out.&lt;br /&gt;They work exactly as described.  I&#x27;ve ordered these several times.</li>
    <li> Does the trick of keeping the earrings secure in lobes.</li>
    <li> I tore my earlobe years ago and all the earrings on that side hang longer than the other if I don&#x27;t use the Lobe Wonder.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why there&#x27;s been any bad reviews on these. These are a lifesaver. I have very thin skin, so when my nephew ripped one of my earrings practically through my ear I was sure I was going to have to pay $500 to put a few stitches in it. I stopped wearing all the earrings I loved. Then I found these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, you can wear these more than once. Just don&#x27;t take them off and reapply the same ones. I just leave them on through my bath or shower, and they are still able to be used the next day. The only issue with this is that when you do take them off that next day/night, there is a little residue from where the adhesive got wet. Just take a washcloth and some non irritating soap and rub it off. It&#x27;s easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now can wear all the earrings I love. AND, if I want to wear really heavy earrings for an event, I can just double the adhesives up and boom, instant support. For such a cheap price, these are amazing and I&#x27;m so happy I tried them on a whim. They delivered fast and are 100% worth it. They don&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and are easy to apply. You also don&#x27;t see them and forget they&#x27;re on. I&#x27;m thankful!</li>
    <li> I was unable to wear the wire earrings, due to holes drooping, until I found this product.  Will never be without them!</li>
    <li> For potential clients who thought that wearing pierced earrings was over for them due to torn or split lobes.  I tear a sheet off for them and have them try it at my shows.  Voila!  I just sold a pair of stud earrings!  I give them the sheet of about a dozen until they can buy them for themselves.  Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> A bit of a hassle to use, but results are great! Just what I need for my skinny little lobes.</li>
    <li> They are ok.  It&#x27;s not like my ear looks like the improved one in the picture.  I think it does help the hole not get worse though.</li>
    <li> After all these years of worry that the next set of earrings was going to cause the hole to break completely through the bottom, I feel and look better!.  And no surgery which I understand never lasts.  These are easy to use each morning, can&#x27;t be seen, stay in place, and hold the earring up in the correct location all day long.  Inexpensive and easy.  My kind of product.</li>
    <li> Love these. I had my ears stretched as a teenager. As an adult I want to wear regular hoops and earrings. These saved my life. I can wear earrings again!</li>
    <li> These are great. They stay on for a couple days and definitely do the job! So happy that I ordered them</li>
    <li> I have had a telephone stuck in my left ear for the past 30 years.  The phone pulled my earrings down and lengthened my pierced ear.  With Lobe Wonder my earrings don&#x27;t move or pull.  It&#x27;s a great invention.  I have been using this product for more than 6 years and could not live without it.</li>
    <li> I have not been able to find these in any of my city&#x27;s local stores....even those such as Bed &amp; Bath that used to carry them.  Therefore, was very happy to find these through Amazon and much cheaper considering quantity than when previously purchased in a store.</li>
    <li> Lobe wonder is great.  whether you have saggy earlobes or not it&#x27;s perfect just to prevent.</li>
    <li> This product works relatively well.  It does what it is supposed to do.  That is, it provides support to the ear lobe so earrings don&#x27;t stretch your hole too much.  Sometimes I think the adhesive could be stickier because when I try to push the earring thru the hole, it pushes the lobe patch off my ear.  However other times the patch adheres quite well.  It just might be that my skin is sometimes oilier than normal. One thing I like about it is the value.  I bought a smaller package at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond (they no longer carry this item) and for a single package of 60 I spent a lot more. (Can&#x27;t remember the exact amount) Overall this product is pretty good.</li>
    <li> Been using these for years.  I can wear any type of earring.  Have not lost one yet.  Make sure your back fits tightly. Buy several boxes insure you don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> Lobe Wonder is a brilliant product. So simple but so effective. Does what it says and you can get a few days out of it even after showering.</li>
    <li> These are great  for those of us that have had our ears pierced for 25 yrs.</li>
    <li> Great for torn ear lobes&lt;br /&gt;Allows you to wear pierced earrings that will stay in place and not slip down</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without these Lobe Wonders.  After many years of very large and heavy earrings, my ear holes are very stretched and without Lobe Wonders I would not be able to wear majority of my earrings, especially my wire ones.  Lobe Wonders allow me to wear all kinds of earrings.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without them!  Solves my problem with earrings staying in a stretched lobe.&lt;br /&gt;Will make another purchase soon! Wonder-ful!</li>
    <li> These really do work. I bought earrings for my wedding day and when I brought them home they were making my ears droop. Saw these online and figured I&#x27;d try them. They not only lifted my ear lobe but stayed on the whole day.</li>
    <li> Love this!  I can finally wear earrings!  Works perfectly! Perfect for anyone with a tear.  Awesome product to use always!</li>
    <li> I really like these ear lobe supports for heavy earrings. It stops your earlobe from looking stretched and stops the earring from feeling so heavy. Great product !</li>
    <li> My jeweler highly recommended Lobe wonder to me as I love long dramatic earrings . I have been using this product for about six months and can wear any earring I like without being uncomfortable or worrying about stretching of my ears . Wish I had this product in the 1980&#x27;s !</li>
    <li> I BUY THESE FOR A FRIEND THAT HAS EARLOBES THAT ARE TOTALLY SLIT OPEN FROM WEARING TOO HEAVY EARRINGS . SHE IS SO EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO WEAR EARRINGS AGAIN !! GREAT PRODUCT !!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, it allows you to wear the fabulous earrings  that you normally couldn&#x27;t wear.  Excellent support.  I can&#x27;t live without them!</li>
    <li> Bought these on the recommendation of a friend. I was very surprised how well they work. A little tricky to get on at first but after a few tries it gets easier.&lt;br /&gt;Phyllis Hoch</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re wonderful ,I won&#x27;t change them for nothing .I recommend them</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Unable to wear any earrings without it.    Always quick delivery and I love the fact that I can purchase   enough to last 6 months or so.</li>
    <li> These did not work for me.  They were a waste of money and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.  I had received a pair of stud ear rings for Christmas and needed the extra support on my pierced ears that had stretched from wearing heavy ear rings. The diamond studs went back to the store!  I tried every way possible and these patches did not work.</li>
    <li> These were useless and difficult to apply and get to stay on.  Unfortunately the search continues as I just cannot wear very heavy earrings</li>
    <li> Very nice product, works as expected,</li>
    <li> Love these. They work great.</li>
    <li> These Lobe Wonders are great support when wearing earrings as the holes in my ears are damaged and I need the support</li>
    <li> Use these patches every day. I have them on automatic reorder. Greatest invention. With out Lobe Wonder I would need to stop wearing all my pierced earrings and switch to clips.  Have recommended them to friends, family and even strangers.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, I don&#x27;t leave the house without them! They provide 100% resolution to sagging pierced earlobes from damaged or heavy&lt;br /&gt;earrings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wear my earrings without these wonderful supports, because my pierced ear holes were opened a bit too much after my young son grabbed my earrings when he was small. Thank you for making these! I&#x27;ve been a loyal customer for years, and really appreciate this product.</li>
    <li> I am happy with my lobe wonder patchs I recieved on time they work great. My one ear is completely ripped now I can wear earrings again till can get fixed</li>
    <li> Love Lob Wonder Earring Support patches.  The holes in ears were stretched so badly that  I could not wear wire earrings.  These completely solve this problem!  Can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
    <li> These patches have prevented me from considering re-piercing my ears, do to large holes.  Will refer others with similar ear problems.</li>
    <li> Now I can enjoy all of my earrings.  I had some that I would only wear for a couple of hours due to them being so heavy but these have changed that. I love this product.</li>
    <li> A total waste of money!  Did not work! They would not support the earrings and sometimes I could not get the earring post to go thru the patch!</li>
    <li> I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who wears pierced earrings -- after years of not being able to wear earrings because of a torn piercing I am now buying, wearing and enjoying earrings again.</li>
    <li> Great product...I have used for years.</li>
    <li> This is a re-order.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without them.</li>
    <li> Does the trick!  No more saggy earrings. Each patch lasts several days.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me.  Ear lobe sagged just as much with or without the patches.</li>
    <li> These are miraculous.  Easy to put on and stay put for several days.  I can wear heavier earrings again!! I definitely would recommend these to others.</li>
    <li> Used them for years. they get the job done!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. especially with all the heavy earrings. Just an extra protection, I had a procedure for split ears, never will have to do anything like that with this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I never leave home without them..</li>
    <li> I guess my headline says it all. Sometimes simple is better. I wear pearl studs every day and they pull my earlobe forward. I&#x27;ve tried plastic disks in there alright but they get lost and fall down. These backings last for days even in the shower, are comfortable can be cut to size if you have small earlobes, pretty much an ideal solution for inexpensive costume jewelry to expensive diamond studs</li>
    <li> I have stretched the holes in my ears over the years and have not worn anything dangly or with any weight at all in so long.&lt;br /&gt;Now I can. you can&#x27;t see them either.</li>
    <li> Really stay on well.  Quick ship.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve ued them for years and years!</li>
    <li> So I was very skeptical when buying this product but I did anyways based on the review.  I was SHOCKED when I got the product and realized they were just little circles of what seemed to be tape. But let me tell you, these are as amazing as the reviews say they are. I have two holes in my ear and the one I use daily is very low (my grandma did it for me and it was not centered). Any earrings I wore (even studs) would kind of droop and look bad. But this item keeps the earring where it&#x27;s supposed to be and now my earrings look centered on my ear. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Great item.... Will continue to buy when I run out.</li>
    <li> These work awesome!  I can wear any type of earring now.  I was looking at spending lots of money to get my ripped ears fixed but now I just use these!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years because my earring holes are stretched out (I think from sleeping with earrings in when I was younger). I use them every time I wear earrings with a wire, and they make a big difference. They keep the earrings from further stretching out the holes and make it look like my earring hole is a normal size. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wearing really heavy earrings with these if you already have stretched out earring holes, but they are great for light to medium weight earrings!</li>
    <li> What a great idea for people with stretched ear holes. I wore large earrings years ago and they stretched my ear holes considerably.  I will not get surgery to decrease the size of my ear holes now. They stick to the back of your ears and stay there for days!</li>
    <li> I have been using them for years - they are great.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for years.  I have one pierced earring hole that was torn larger many years ago when my daughter as a baby grabbed my dangling earring.  A small pierced earring goes right through the hole so I put one of these on the back of my ear lobe and the post will stay in and look normal.  I talked to a doctor one time about fixing the ear lobe and the price to repair was over $500.  I can buy a lot of Lobe Wonders for that price!</li>
    <li> These things allow you to wear earrings of considerable weight with no sagging ear lobes.&lt;br /&gt;I always keep an extra box on hand- so little money for such a great little gadget.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be without these support patches.  Gets rid of the ugly and sagging lobes which age you.</li>
    <li> I could not wear earrings without Lobe Wonder.  After years of abuse holding the phone to my shoulder, my earring holes were so stretched out.</li>
    <li> If your lobes are slightly torn these fix the problem! They also hold your earrings in perfect position! Love, love, love them!</li>
    <li> At a jewelry party I was complaining about my left ear lobe being stretched to the point that I felt I could not wear larger earrings.  I was told about Lobe Wonder, tried them, and they really work. I&#x27;ve been using them for several years, so if you have this issue try them.  I am always able to find most everything I&#x27;m looking for  on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have ordered \\&quot;Lobe Wonders\\&quot; for several years, now.  It seems they are slowly becoming smaller, and the adhesive does not stick to your ear lobes as well as it did years back.  I use to be able to get a couple of days use from them in the past, but now a new pair is needed each time I change my earrings.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product before and am happy to wear earrings again! I am not able to wear earrings without them!</li>
    <li> Okay I must be doing something wrong. These things do not help me. They don&#x27;t stay on. I am not asking for money back because for the price its not worth my time to return.</li>
    <li> Does just what it claims - keep a supply on hand and don&#x27;t run out.  They work! A tip for anyone who has worn dangling earrings for more than 5 years!</li>
    <li> I purchased these fo my wife. Her easr lobes are very elongated, and having a surgeon repair them is too expensive at this time. Because they are so severly damaged, she actually must use one on front and back of each earlobe. She is very pleased with them , and believes they are a perfect fix for her, and probably work great for anyone that has a problem,especially if they are not as torn as hers.</li>
    <li> For a long time, due to years of wearing (and often sleeping in) heavy earrings, I could only wear light studs or small hoops because of the verticle stretch my piercing had become.  After reading the reviews of this product, and seeing the very reasonable price, I decided to try it.  I can now comfortably wear small studs that would have fallen right through the back of the hole, heavier studs that would have fallen forward, or dangly earrings that would have looked funny before without worrying that I will lose one or that they will look funny.  The 3 pack has lots of patches - I feel like I use them all the time and have barely made a dent.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Doesn&#x27;t work. I am sorry to have ordered the 4 pack of this product. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on Amazon a couple of weeks ago.  It&#x27;s pretty good, however, I wish the adhesive was a tad bit stronger; therefore you wouldn&#x27;t have to change them everyday.  I notice that I experience the constant need to change them with my torn lobe.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product several times, they really work and make all the difference.  I would highly reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> very pleased with this product. after years of having a torn pierce I was so happy when I found this product.</li>
    <li> Tried these to help my poor old earlobes when I wear earrings.  I you have low holes in your ears, wear heavy earrings, or find that as the years go by, the holes are getting longer, you might want to try these.  Applying them is a little tricky, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s not bad.  It&#x27;s a little difficult to place them in the right spot and then get the earring stem to go through the ear and through the pad, but once it does, it makes for a tighter fit on the earring, holds the earring up, takes pressure off the ear and they last all day.  They are also reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still deliberating on this particular product.  I did try it, once.  I use to have long slits in my ears some time back but they had already healed themselves so all I have are the lower holes towards bottom of my ears.  When I pulled each patch off...&amp;#34;ouch(!) it hurt!&amp;#34;....but I lived.  lol&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to re-puncture my ears so I may not have a need for the patches and 4 boxes are really more then I want or need.  (I was not paying close attention to the ad prior to ordering, so is my fault.  You&#x27;d think I&#x27;d learn.)  Might end up giving them away.</li>
    <li> This item is amazing for those of us who have worn earrings that were too heavy and have stretched the holes in our ears. I have recommended this to numerous women. great for men too.</li>
    <li> I have been buying Lobe Wonder at Claire&#x27;s because they are local, but it is quite expensive.  I need them because one of my ear lobes is torn through and without them I can&#x27;t wear earrings.  Thanks so much for the great pricing.</li>
    <li> Works just as described! Now I can wear dangle earrings without stretching pierced ears.</li>
    <li> I love these, they have really saved my ears when wearing heavy earrings.  I recommend this to all my friends.  One more important note.  Many oft friends have had their thin ear lobes split due to heavy earrings.  These ear protectors allow me to wear all types of jewelry.  Try them and you&#x27;ll never leave home without them😊</li>
    <li> These work fabulously! Very happy with them. Quick delivery also.</li>
    <li> I love these, I like to wear bigger earrings and don&#x27;t want to stretch my earlobe.  Been using these for a couple of years.</li>
    <li> Lobe Wonder offers enough support to wear pretty hefty earrings without looking like the end of your earlobe is going to rip through at any minute. Bought one box to try them out, just ordered a pack of four boxes. They have become a maintenance staple! Let&#x27;s face it, unless you get your ears surgically repaired this is the next best thing!</li>
    <li> I kinda like these, the only thing is sometimes they slide off depending on the earrings.  Still using them though.</li>
    <li> These really do work like they are supposed to. I ran out and shocked up on more. When these run out I&#x27;ll stock up on more. Thank you for being on Amazon this purchase was easy and they came as promised on their scheduled date.</li>
    <li> This is at least my 5th purchase of these earring support patches.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them to every woman that wears large or heavy earrings.&lt;br /&gt;Also great if your ear lobes and piercings have stretched.  They will make it&lt;br /&gt;easy to still wear bigger and/or dangly earrings.  I love this product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I wear them with all hoops and any heavier earrings....even stud type.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product I am able to wear my earrings and feel safe and secure without the fear of losing them.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from droopy earrings my entire adult life.  The holes in my earlobes have extended for what seems like a little bit each year.  I looked into having a stitch put in to close the bottom part but the cost is ridiculous and does not make much sense to me for something like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had resigned myself to wearing only weighless post earrings with a wide back for support but NO MORE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take my earrings out (of both holes, they are double pierced) and place one of the small disks on the back of my earlobe and like magic I can wear my precious hoop earrings again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to put the earring through the hole in your ear and as soon as you can feel the earring through the patch BEFORE you pop through the patch push the earring ALL the way up to the top of the hole and then pop through the patch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They stay on through several showers and are not detectable at all even with the daily ponytail (mom of a 5yr old).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the fence, give them a try...I was so confident that I bought the pack of 4 and dont regret it for a second!!</li>
    <li> Love them!  They&#x27;re amazing and work perfectly.  I&#x27;m able to wear earrings that have been put away for years.</li>
    <li> Best purchase ever! Saved my stretched out earlobe and now no one tells me my earrings are falling out</li>
    <li> I tried the Ear Bling guard dots, but I purchased these because the price was cheaper.  Let me say that there is a difference.  These do not really last, they slip as the day goes on..I think the material is not as strong as the other brand. Also after awhile I can feel the weight of my earrings with these. With the other brand you can&#x27;t and the quality is much better. Just spend the extra money and go with the other brand that works!</li>
    <li> I started using these years ago, because I love large earrings, but the earrings dont love my ear lobes. These little \\&quot;lifesavers\\&quot; spare my lobes the pressure from the larger earrings and keep me stylish. I reccommend them to others who wear large earrings or have damaged ear lobes.</li>
    <li> This simple to use product is a &amp;#34;wonder&amp;#34; for sure!  Peel off near invisible patch, place on back of ear--insert pierced earring post, attach earring back, and you&#x27;re all set.  Earring is held firmly in place, and you&#x27;d never know there is a stretched earlobe there!  I had a pair of diamond stud earrings I hadn&#x27;t worn in a long time because I was afraid of losing them--my lobes are so stretched from wearing heavy pierced earrings over the years--&amp;#34;Lobe Wonder&amp;#34; made it possible for me to wear my diamonds without worrying about losing one or both.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Used these for years for a slit earlobe. They allow me to wear any erring I choose.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE A WONDER. NOW I CAN WEAR EARRINGS THAT I COULDNT BEFORE. THE STICKERS LAST FOR ABOUT A WEEK. GREAT PRODUCT AND GREAT PRICE. I USE TO BUY THEM FROM CLAIRES FOR 15 FOR 30.</li>
    <li> My lobes are not stretched out-yet. But, I like them because they will prevent that from happening. I do, on occasion, like heavy earrings and these make it feel like they are not that bad, even in the heat they hold up.</li>
    <li> Not my first order I love these things they&#x27;re better than any other product out there for my ears.</li>
    <li> use them all the time</li>
    <li> They worked very well and I definitely didn&#x27;t have any issues with them falling off.  They stuck very well to my lobe and are very comfortable.</li>
    <li> So useful and easy,and affordable.  These work like mini band aids that keep the earring in place and prevent further lobe tearing.</li>
    <li> I bought these after I saw my Mother had them. They are a little big for my earlobe. It was awkward getting them in the right place so they didn&#x27;t show out of the bottom of my earlobe. Sometimes it took two or three tries after which there was no stickiness left. When I did get it right they were great. So put them on when your lobe is dry from creams. My second comment is that when I tried to use them after I had been wearing wires and hoops for a while, the patches ability to stick had decreased. It was like the patches lost their effectiveness as they got older in the box. I am ordering again because for the price they are worth the effect.</li>
    <li> hard to put on correctly but once you get them on they do a good job ..,,&lt;br /&gt;they work fine</li>
    <li> We are indian family, and my mom loves them.&lt;br /&gt;she plans to gift it to many friends back in india</li>
    <li> Outstanding product. Until I repair my ear lobes , I will continue to use this product. Love this product a lot</li>
    <li> One of my earlobe holes is stretched out more than the other, and when I would wear dangly earrings, one would hang lower than the other. Maybe no one noticed, but it drove me crazy. This solves it! Your earrings will just sit right up where they are supposed to. Even studs sit up nicely instead of pointing downwards. I don&#x27;t even feel them in. I&#x27;m so happy I can wear long earrings again without feeling self-conscious or feeling like they are about to rip off. I will be re-ordering these for life!</li>
    <li> Just what I expected:)</li>
    <li> I love then patches. I wore a pair of heavy earrings when I was younger and they stretch my ears. This is the perfect solution and can wear all kinds of earrings.</li>
    <li> When I use these support patches, I have a difficult time placing it correctly -- even after having pierced ears for decades.  I thought it was a one-time use, but I forgot to remove them until the following afternoon.  So, I guess you can wear them for more than a day.  The reason I tried it was because I purchased a few hoop earrings in stainless steel and they&#x27;re pretty weighty.</li>
    <li> Delivered immediately - excellent product that enables me to wear heavy earrings without pulling the pierced opening out of shape.&lt;br /&gt;Will order again and recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> If you have torn your ear lobes, where the hole is too large for your earrings, this is the ticket!  This product works well and is reasonably priced.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really like this product because it helps keep my earrings in place, and helps prevent my stud earrings from going all the was through the piercings in my ears.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I have a ripped ear so now I am still able to wear my pierced earrings.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I have a torn ear-lobe from holding the phone to my ear with my shoulder while using the computer.  Lobe Wonder supports the weight and position of the earring&lt;br /&gt;so it doesn&#x27;t hang lower than the opposite ear.  My earrings are now the same length and stable.  Many thanx!!</li>
    <li> Used for years.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> It really works.  It takes a bit of effort to punch through the patches with some of your earrings, others are easy to punch through.</li>
    <li> They are the perfect solution to heavy earrings. They hold the earring in place and last through several showers.</li>
    <li> These are ovals of clear medical tape, about 3/8&amp;#34; long, that you peel off a piece of paper and stick to the back of your ear lobe. You are paying for the convenience of having the ovals cut out for you; if you were thrifty and handy with scissors you could buy a roll of tape and make your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend cleaning the back of your ear lobe with rubbing alcohol and letting it dry before applying the tape. This will remove natural oils and moisturizer/makeup residue and help the tape adhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear wire earrings rather than posts. My ears were pierced at home with a needle rather than with a gun, and sometimes I have to work a bit to get the wires to go through. Because of this I can&#x27;t stick the tape to my ear and then push the wire through it; I have to put the wire through the lobe, pierce the tape with the wire, then push the tape along the wire to the lobe and stick it on. This was pretty awkward the first couple of times and I did have to reposition the tape more than once, but it got easier with practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these because my holes have stretched into slits and I haven&#x27;t been able to wear the dangly earrings I really like. I hoped these patches would allow me to wear my favorite earrings again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several attempts to pierce the patches low enough and place them on my lobes high enough, I did feel they provided some support. They don&#x27;t provide the miracle cure shown on the packaging, but they may at least help prevent the holes from stretching more than they already have. Maybe they&#x27;ll work better as my technique improves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would probably work better, though, if the color of the tape doesn&#x27;t contrast too much with your skin tone, is cutting patches out of &amp;#34;flesh&amp;#34; colored cloth medical tape. Cloth tape would offer much more support than this kind of thin, clear tape. I actually might give that a try . . .</li>
    <li> This product gives stability to stretched lobe piercing.  I&#x27;m glad somebody thought of this idea and marketed the same.</li>
    <li> Very hard to apply to ear</li>
    <li> This item does not WORK!  Your earrings just slide right off as if you used nothing at all.  A total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Am now able to wear all types of dangling earrings!! I recommend this product to anyone who has difficulty wearing heavy pierced earrings.</li>
    <li> I have one earlobe with an enlarged hole. It looks lopsided if I don&#x27;t use these. Easy to put on and they stay put. One caution: don&#x27;t leave on for many days in a row or you might get a rash. Otherwise, they are fine for one to three days at a time.</li>
    <li> I wear these everyday.  My ears were pierced a little too low on the lobe and stud earrings do not sit properly.  With the lobe wonders I can position my earrings so that they don&#x27;t sag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> I have a torn earlobe, so that my earring hangs Down lower on one side than the other.  Using this handy little sticker puts the earring up higher so I don&#x27;t look quite so lopsided.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and was exactly what I needed for my torn earring holes. I can wear heavier earrings again! I also have tiny earrlobes, so I have to get these on &amp;#34;just so&amp;#34; so that the edges won&#x27;t stick out and get my hair stuck in it. Also, it will probably take me several years to go through all 4 boxes. Maybe split this order with a friend.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wear earrings without this product.  Years ago, I tore one earring piercing.  This product not only keeps the hole from getting larger, but when wearing studs, it keeps the torn one in place.</li>
    <li> This product really works for me.  The alternative for me is expensive ear lobe surgery which I cannot afford and is too risky so this is a better option and it works great!</li>
    <li> Before I started wearing these several years ago, well meaning people would tell me one of my earrings was about to fall out.  That&#x27;s because my left lobe tore decades ago, and the only way to fix the problem is a) surgery (which I&#x27;ll probably get one of these days) or b) earring support patches.  These easy to use, discreet patches adhere to the back of my ear, allowing me to wear any earrings I want.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> These are perfect as a support patch for pierced ears that have became large due to wearing large earrings.</li>
    <li> I love these things!  I reccomend them to everyone with pierced ears.  I buy 6 boxes at a time...they don&#x27;t spoil!</li>
    <li> I got this after seeing it in good morning America&lt;br /&gt;It really does it&#x27;s job I love it&lt;br /&gt;Recommends it to all</li>
    <li> Great support for my heavy earrings.  I order this product often.</li>
    <li> I COULDN&#x27;T WEAR THE LIGHTEST PIERCED EARRRINGS TODAY IF IT WASN&#x27;T FOR THESE WONDER LOBES.  THE HEAVY EARRINGS FROM \\&quot;YONDER YEARS\\&quot; HAVE PULLED THE HOLES DOWN CONSIDERABLY.  THESE HOLD THE EARRINGS IN PLACE AND THEY LOOK MUCH BETTER.</li>
    <li> I use these all the time and they are very helpful for my flimsy earlobes and my holes in my ears are like slits.  These ear lobe supports enable me to wear earrings and have them look well and sit up higher on my ears than they otherwise could.  It takes a while to get used to getting them on the ear in the right place.  One has to get used to anything new.</li>
    <li> Love these!  Wish I had known about them years ago!  Now maybe I won&#x27;t have such long slits in my ears, and they make wearing heavy pierced earrings comfortable.</li>
    <li> These small, easy-to-use little patches have changed the kinds of earrings I am able to wear.  Without them I could only wear post type earrings or very lightweight hooks.  Now with the support of these patches I can wear heavier earrings without worrying that they might pull on my ear or make the piercing points stretch longer.  They make wearing any earrings more comfortable and secure.  I am so glad that I discovered these, and I recommend them for anyone who has pierced ears.</li>
    <li> Perfect fix without surgery for torn earlobe! Earrings sit perfectly on lobe when used!Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I must have a collagen problem in my earlobes because my earring holes are rather large, despite the fact that I wear only post earrings. This are great because they hold the earrings upright and prevent drooping.</li>
    <li> I bought these because my ear lobes have been stretched out from wearring heavy earrings. I was hoping these would provide enough support so I could still wear my favorite earrings. I was skeptical when they came and turned out to be thin, adhesive discs. Unfortunately, I was right to be skeptical. The lobe wonder discs offered no support at all.</li>
    <li> Was so hoping these would let me wear my bigger earrings but they seem to distort my lobes.  A Bummer...</li>
    <li> Excellent for wearing heavier earrings. It works and you don&#x27;t notice it. It took a tremendous amount of pressure off my ears.</li>
    <li> I started using these patches several years ago because I have a tear in my left ear lobe.  These patches work great to keep earrings in place and prevent sagging.  Anyone who may have this problem should try it, as well as those who may not to prevent tears from heavy earrings.</li>
    <li> I was not pleased with my purchase. I like the product and have used it before. I didn&#x27;t recieve a box of 4. I only received 1 box .</li>
    <li> Found out about this product several years ago when I was considering surgery to repair my stretched earlobes. I had my ears pierced at 10 years old and after....well...lets just say a long time, they were pretty stretched and unattractive. I have used these everyday since.  They are wonderful. And saved me thousands in surgery...and pain!!!</li>
    <li> Does not function at all as promised.  Flimsy \\&quot;Avery\\&quot; type plastic \\&quot;label\\&quot; that does not work at all.  Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.  Wife loves this</li>
    <li> Loved these until Itried AAmazon&#x27;s Blinguard</li>
    <li> excellent purchase! seller really helpful ... I loved it! I recommend!</li>
    <li> These actually work! I recommend.</li>
    <li> These are great to support earrings when your earlobe is torn or large. However, you must remember to remove them or the adhesive can itch. Also, if you don&#x27;t place them exactly on the ear correctly, they can be seen.</li>
    <li> Years ago, I had discovered that I could not wear &amp;#34;wire&amp;#34; earrings because of the large holes in my ears that had developed over time.  I loved the wire styles and was sad that I couldn&#x27;t wear them.  Then I discovered Lobe Wonders and the problem is solved!  It takes a little while to learn how to use them properly, but once you get the hang of it, they are wonderful!</li>
    <li> These weren&#x27;t great.  They work ok, but not well enough to buy again.</li>
    <li> I have very thin ear lobes so these keep my earrings in place and prohibit tearing as much!  I wear these every day.</li>
    <li> The product did not quite meet my expectations but it did improve my situation. The picture that shows on the package suggests that using these little stickers would actually make your ear lobe appear regular or &amp;#34;healed&amp;#34; but it doesn&#x27;t. It does however relieve the pressure that was on the small amount of skin left on the bottom of my ear lobe and I can now wear the heavier earrings I love without pain or irritation. They do not last up to 3 days. I get 2. I am still going to pursue getting my ear fixed by a doctor. This is not a permanent solution for me.</li>
    <li> Been using them for years have to be patient when applying them to get them centered over the pierced hole. Then if it isn&#x27;t right you have to use a new one. Otherwise, I love them.</li>
    <li> Great product - works great</li>
    <li> Did not add any support.  Very little difference.</li>
    <li> This product is great. No more saggy earlobes (yay!) and the company was speedy with they&#x27;re shipping. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wears dangly earings</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it claims to do. It really does support the stretched ear lobe when one wears heavy earrings. Recommended if you love heavy jewelry. This fixes the appearance of the lobes being weighed down.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS THE BEST PURCHASE IF YOU HAVE A TORN EAR LOBE!!!!!!!!!! IT REALLY WORKS!! YOU WILL BE HAPPY YOU PURCHASED THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> i have had my ears pierced since i was 3 years old... and no one ever told me that you shouldn&#x27;t sleep in your earrings... which i did all the time (because i mainly wear stud pearls).  but over the past couple of years i noticed that even my pearl studs were drooping and it looked ridiculous.  i use these now for any earring and they totally work.  best part- since i have been using these and taking my earrings out at night- the holes have actually started to shrink just a bit.</li>
    <li> The piercings in my earlobes had gotten pretty stretched due to wearing heavy earrings. Earlobe Wonders have made a huge difference ! They hold my earrings at the right place rather than hanging down at the very tips of my lobes. These are great!</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product for anyone who has droopy lobes or stretched lobes. I am finally able to wear some of my amethyst earrings that were a little heavy - and probably what stretched my ears to begin with. I love this product and am now including it with heavy earrings that I sell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these lob patches for a long time now, and they are frankly a life saver for me.  Both of the holes in my ear lobes have gotten quite large, especially my left ear.  Now that I use them, I can wear wire earrings that dangle, which I couldn&#x27;t use before. I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon carries these, so that now I can always use them.</li>
    <li> Lobe Wonder doesn&#x27;t work for earlobes that are already stretched out, or for earrings that are significantly heavy.  If you have normally earlobes and moderate earrings, they might be useful for preventing earlobe damage, but if you have existing damage, you should consider investing in a lobe lift instead of buying these supports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you are young and just getting your ears pierced, than just make sure your holes are placed high on the sturdiest part of your earlobe, and never wear heavy earrings.  An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and these little patches did nothing to undo years of damage to my old earlobes.</li>
    <li> They work &amp;#34;wonders&amp;#34;.  I have told a lot of my friends.</li>
    <li> These are great. After years of wearing heavy earrings, I had kind of given up on wearing wires. These make it so that I can wear any earrings. Can&#x27;t beat the price. Much cheaper than single boxes retail.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these things. This is the third set I have ordered for her.</li>
    <li> Actually works and supports the torn earlobe I have.  Only reason it isn&#x27;t a 5 star is because patch isn&#x27;t waterproof and gets gunky if your ear gets wet.  I water mist my hair before blow drying, so I have to replace the patch frequently, but the patch is an essential item for me now. I order 4 boxes at a time.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re amazing kind of hard to place on the back of your ear I put them on the front nobody can notice a thing</li>
    <li> work well, easier to order via Amazon than to find in stores</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed, thank you.</li>
    <li> Exactly as ordered and swift to boot!</li>
    <li> Perfect product. Delivered on time as expected!</li>
    <li> I have been using these lobe wonder patches for over 14 years.  I was holding my 4 year old nephew aned I was wearing large hoops in my ears. He was wanting to get down and some how his finger looped in my earring and almost tore my earring off. Anyway I now have a long hole instead of just a small hole to put earring in.  And thus because of that my earrings do not hang the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One earring is always slightly longer than the other side. Well, I bought these lobe wonder patches and tried them. I only wear it on the affected ear. It stays put and now no one would ever know about the above mentioned incident.  And I have kept the patches on for several days. Showering does not loosen them. Yet they are easy to peel off .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing about them is when I have really heavy earrings I wear the patches in both ears.  That way it helps support the earrings reducing  too heavy feeling that as the day wears on becomes quite uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never bought any similar product to this to compare it with because I would rate this a 10 star rating if I could. I do highly recommend these patches !!</li>
    <li> Quite a few years ago while in a hurry to change clothes, I caught an earring in a sweater that I was pulling off over my head.  In struggling to get it free, I tore the pierced hole in one of my ear lobes.  Nearly all the way through...but not quite.  Ever since, when I wear earrings, one of them dangles down much further.  It&#x27;s sort of creepy looking just balanced there on that tiny bit of remaining skin.  I even tried out some vintage clip-on earrings but couldn&#x27;t get used to having my lobes squeezed for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These support patches have made a big difference with some of my earrings.  I would have given a higher rating, but they seem to only work well with my earrings that are a very light-weight.  My slightly heavier earrings (and they&#x27;re really not that big/heavy) tend to pull the adhesive patch down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they&#x27;re not always that easy to put on and get the earring post through.  I&#x27;m getting better at it though...must be a learning curve.  The earring post/wire tends to push the adhesive patch off rather than go through it.  I&#x27;ve found that keeping my finger pressed tight against the patch as I&#x27;m pushing the earring wire through helps the wire to pierce the patch without dislodging it (just be careful to not puncture your finger or thumb with the earring wire when you do this).  Also have had luck with piercing a small hole in the patch BEFORE I stick it to the back of my ear...then the earring wire just has to find the hole you&#x27;ve already made.  Anyway, with many of my earrings, my torn lobe isn&#x27;t as noticeable now and both earrings hang at the same level.</li>
    <li> Great product ..wear them all the time.  They really make wearing earrings easier.  I can only wear studs and this helps greatly.  Always have some on hand...</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without these. They are easy to use and give me excellent support.  I can wear my heavier ear rings all day at work pain free!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so excited to wear my studs again!  I had my left ear repierced after the original piercing closed up.  Over time, the hole reopened my two piercings became one.  This caused my earring to droop.  I&#x27;m so happy I don&#x27;t have to worry about that anymore now that I&#x27;m using the support patches.  The only problem I have found is that they don&#x27;t seem to work with my heavier, dangly earrings.</li>
