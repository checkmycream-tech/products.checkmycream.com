      <li>excellent seller, very good product, all according to the description recommend</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m happy I found it.</li>
      <li>Great price for the product.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product. .</li>
      <li>The price is great and it comes sealed.</li>
      <li>, I didn&#x27;t expect it to feel the way it does, it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
      <li>Just as I remembered it, amazing!</li>
      <li>a must if you have fair skin like I do.  </li>
      <li>It feels really good going on, doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cake&amp;#34; in lines &amp; wrinkles, and give good coverage.</li>
      <li>was upset when I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore but delighted to find it at Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s all it was good for..</li>
      <li>SO glad I found this!  </li>
      <li>Feels great, refreshing but, wish it had better coverage.</li>
      <li>So with my own brush</li>
      <li>This is by far the greatest powder I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I am going to order 5 more.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS</li>
      <li>and I am glad I found it online.</li>
      <li>This used to be my favorite makeup but got discontinued</li>
      <li>and I think it looks better if the moisturizer has time to absorb into my skin before applying the powder.  </li>
      <li>and I look even better with just the powder!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Glad I found it here :)</li>
      <li>Much better than in the store.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
      <li>It only took a week to get to me and was my perfect color.</li>
      <li>I really love this make-up.  </li>
      <li>Good product and worth the money.</li>
      <li>After I used this make-up the first time it seemed very good, it went on smoothly, evenly, and easily.  </li>
      <li>I tried this make-up because I wanted something quick and easy that still looked good on those days</li>
      <li>Covers beautifully and looks natural.  </li>
      <li>it looks natural and I get compliments like, \\&quot;you have beautiful skin\\&quot; and \\&quot;you look like you&#x27;re glowing\\</li>
      <li>/&gt;Instead of giving 1 star I gave 2 because I liked the ingredients and the cool feeling of the minerals when applied.  </li>
      <li>but this dosnt look cakey at all its a lovely cool feeling when i do my friends makeup there</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and will come back.</li>
      <li>an the small bit of shimmer in there is perfect.</li>
      <li>This powder feels really refreshing when I first apply it.</li>
      <li>I love this foundation its light and not to much, doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily.</li>
      <li>I like this makeup a lot, it goes on cool just as advertised</li>
      <li>It felt cool when It was applied</li>
      <li>its not just cool and its so diffrent</li>
      <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
      <li>, the powder is great - this shade a bit too dark though.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s strange at first, but it felt good.  </li>
      <li>Certainly it applies &#x27;cool&#x27; but doesn&#x27;t give coverage.</li>
      <li>I also liked the light coverage it provided; it concealed minor skin discolorations (freckles, blemishes, etc.) and still looked natural.  </li>
      <li>The application was easier as the larger brush held more powder and the brush didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the cool wet feeling so much after about a month, but I love the way it covers.</li>
      <li>IT CAME SO FAST.</li>
      <li>I have literally never had a problem finding makeup light enough for my skin before.</li>
      <li>The sans free makeup look is the only thing my skins allows.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want a whole make-up routine.  </li>
      <li>You have to be careful of the color you get (I ended up with too-dark), but this powder definitely makes your skin feel good.</li>
      <li>I love Almay overall as a brand, I&#x27;ve used their Mascara because it is the only one that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes itch and irritate my contacts.</li>
      <li>I will definitely purchase this again as long as it is available.  </li>
      <li>Since I thought it might be possible that the small brush is just to stiff and caused the irritation, I tried the make-up with my own loose powder brush (a nice soft, full-round brush).  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and have to use hypoallergenic products.</li>
      <li>The spf on the powder is not very high so a moisturizer with higher spf is</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ve heard that many black girls cannot wear many Almay face products due to their small shade selection.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m definitely not porcelain-skinned although I am fair, and I usually always buy the second or third lightest shade in face makeups</li>
      <li>The shade in the container looks exactly like my skin shade (maybe a little lighter), but applied it is much darker.  </li>
      <li>The small brush that comes with this make-up slides out of the top of the blue lid.  </li>
      <li>My major problem with the powder is that it has virtually no coverage.</li>
      <li>I waited barely 3 days.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wear the make up anyway - apparently I have a conact allergy to make up.</li>
      <li>Overall, I like the make-up, and I will use it occasionally probably just for daytime wear or when on vacation since it&#x27;s easy to use and the small size is convenient for packing.</li>
      <li>as a heads up for fair-skinned people, Almay&#x27;s lightest shade of the Anti-Aging Smart Shade Concealer was also too dark for me....</li>
      <li>But, the second time I used it my skin got very irritated, itchy, and slightly flushed.  </li>

<li> But, the second time I used it my skin got very irritated, itchy, and slightly flushed.  </li>
<li> purchased enough to last a very LONG while!</li>
<li> i have dry skin</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t see the two shades having a big enough difference between them, and I&#x27;m not worried about pink or yellow undertones as I can usually wear</li>
<li> like why is it wet</li>
<li> Apparently, pale white girls can&#x27;t either.  </li>
<li> a pressed or loose powder make dark spots on my face before.  </li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> This powder is so dark</li>
<li> I was going to avoid giving a review based on improper color choice on my part, but I don&#x27;t think Ivory will work for me either given just how dark Buff is....</li>
<li> I wore it for a few hours and had to wash my face and apply a soothing moisturizer.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little stiff and isn&#x27;t full-round, it is basically a flattened version of the shape of the lid.  </li>
<li> This loose powder foundation make-up really feels cold when being applied!  </li>
<li> I have been using it for the past year and have found nothing to replace it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure why</li>
<li> It stayed even all day and my skin didn&#x27;t feel dry or uncomfortable.  </li>
<li> brush can get annoying because it won&#x27;t stay locked out in ready position, but I&#x27;m not buying it for the brush.</li>
<li> And the &amp;#34;buff&amp;#34; colour is quite dark - I&#x27;ll just end up cutting this foundation powder with another powder and hopefully that&#x27;ll work.</li>
<li> Worse makeup ever created.</li>
<li> this make-up isn&#x27;t irritating my skin.  </li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll still need other concealer on bad days, but sometimes this is all</li>
<li> I went with Buff (second lightest) instead of Ivory (lightest), and boy was that a bad choice!  </li>

    <li> excellent seller, very good product, all according to the description recommend</li>
    <li> Great price for the product.  Much better than in the store.&lt;br /&gt;We will recommend our family &amp; friends purchase this.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the cool wet feeling so much after about a month, but I love the way it covers. it looks natural and I get compliments like, \\&quot;you have beautiful skin\\&quot; and \\&quot;you look like you&#x27;re glowing\\&quot; I only get these compliments when I&#x27;ve applied this powder.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll still need other concealer on bad days, but sometimes this is all I need.&lt;br /&gt;the brush can get annoying because it won&#x27;t stay locked out in ready position, but I&#x27;m not buying it for the brush.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve heard that many black girls cannot wear many Almay face products due to their small shade selection.  Apparently, pale white girls can&#x27;t either.  I&#x27;m definitely not porcelain-skinned although I am fair, and I usually always buy the second or third lightest shade in face makeups so I don&#x27;t look like a raccoon.  I went with Buff (second lightest) instead of Ivory (lightest), and boy was that a bad choice!  I&#x27;ve never had a pressed or loose powder make dark spots on my face before.  The shade in the container looks exactly like my skin shade (maybe a little lighter), but applied it is much darker.

However, the formula is too glittery for me anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as a heads up for fair-skinned people, Almay&#x27;s lightest shade of the Anti-Aging Smart Shade Concealer was also too dark for me....I have literally never had a problem finding makeup light enough for my skin before.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wear the make up anyway - apparently I have a conact allergy to make up. The sans free makeup look is the only thing my skins allows.  Other than that, the powder is great - this shade a bit too dark though.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I have been using it for the past year and have found nothing to replace it.</li>
    <li> SO glad I found this!  I am going to order 5 more. I was so bummed when I could no longer get it at Target. Glad I found it here :)</li>
    <li> This powder is so dark its like a bronzer it made my face a brown orange color it should say bronzer on the package or in description so people know if its for their skin type!</li>
    <li> I love this foundation its light and not to much, doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily. 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Covers beautifully and looks natural.  I will definitely purchase this again as long as it is available.  Good product and worth the money.</li>
    <li> I really love this make-up.  It feels really good going on, doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cake&amp;#34; in lines &amp; wrinkles, and give good coverage.</li>
    <li> I use to buy this make up all the time and I am glad I found it online. The price is great and it comes sealed. Shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> Left my face feeling refreshed and covers my roseca well</li>
    <li> Feels great, refreshing but, wish it had better coverage.</li>
    <li> Just as I remembered it, amazing!</li>
    <li> So i use this on the areas were i sweat over my BB Cream an it works wonderful i have dry skin but this dosnt look cakey at all its a lovely cool feeling when i do my friends makeup there like why is it wet an im lkke its not just cool and its so diffrent an the small bit of shimmer in there is perfect. I LOVE THIS</li>
    <li> This is by far the greatest powder I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even have to wear liquid foundation anymore and I look even better with just the powder!&lt;br /&gt;I was upset when I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore but delighted to find it at Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased enough to last a very LONG while!</li>
    <li> IT CAME SO FAST. I waited barely 3 days. I like it, I didn&#x27;t expect it to feel the way it does, it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
    <li> I tried this make-up because I wanted something quick and easy that still looked good on those days I didn&#x27;t want a whole make-up routine.  This loose powder foundation make-up really feels cold when being applied!  That&#x27;s strange at first, but it felt good.  After I used this make-up the first time it seemed very good, it went on smoothly, evenly, and easily.  It stayed even all day and my skin didn&#x27;t feel dry or uncomfortable.  I also liked the light coverage it provided; it concealed minor skin discolorations (freckles, blemishes, etc.) and still looked natural.  The small brush that comes with this make-up slides out of the top of the blue lid.  It&#x27;s a little stiff and isn&#x27;t full-round, it is basically a flattened version of the shape of the lid.  The second time I used the product I had a very different experience.  I&#x27;m not sure why and the cause may be from the brush applicator rather than the product itself.  But, the second time I used it my skin got very irritated, itchy, and slightly flushed.  I wore it for a few hours and had to wash my face and apply a soothing moisturizer.  Since I thought it might be possible that the small brush is just to stiff and caused the irritation, I tried the make-up with my own loose powder brush (a nice soft, full-round brush).  The application was easier as the larger brush held more powder and the brush didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  So with my own brush this make-up isn&#x27;t irritating my skin.  I do need to have moisturizer on before applying and I think it looks better if the moisturizer has time to absorb into my skin before applying the powder.  The spf on the powder is not very high so a moisturizer with higher spf is a must if you have fair skin like I do.  Overall, I like the make-up, and I will use it occasionally probably just for daytime wear or when on vacation since it&#x27;s easy to use and the small size is convenient for packing.</li>
    <li> You have to be careful of the color you get (I ended up with too-dark), but this powder definitely makes your skin feel good.</li>
    <li> It felt cool when It was applied but that&#x27;s all it was good for..didn&#x27;t blend well</li>
    <li> Worse makeup ever created. Certainly it applies &#x27;cool&#x27; but doesn&#x27;t give coverage. And the &amp;#34;buff&amp;#34; colour is quite dark - I&#x27;ll just end up cutting this foundation powder with another powder and hopefully that&#x27;ll work.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. .</li>
    <li> This powder feels really refreshing when I first apply it. It almost feels like I am putting water on my face! My major problem with the powder is that it has virtually no coverage. I would only recommend this powder to anyone who doesn&#x27;t need a lot of coverage.</li>
    <li> It only took a week to get to me and was my perfect color. This used to be my favorite makeup but got discontinued so I&#x27;m happy I found it. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and will come back.</li>
    <li> I love Almay overall as a brand, I&#x27;ve used their Mascara because it is the only one that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes itch and irritate my contacts. I have sensitive skin and have to use hypoallergenic products. I like this makeup a lot, it goes on cool just as advertised and it helps keep my skin from drying out and getting flaky as it does with some liquid makeup. It has the look of a cream makeup after it&#x27;s on for a while, which I like because it looks like you&#x27;re not wearing powder. I have both Buff and Ivory, I use Ivory in the winter when my skin is a bit paler and Buff in the summer when I have a tan. There is a shimmer in the powder which brightens up my complexion.</li>
