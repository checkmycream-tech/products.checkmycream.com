### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best investment I have made in my motorcycle career!</li>
      <li>But after discovering the perfect placement and psi I use this pillion on every ride when leaving town.</li>
      <li>I bought this cushion for my Canam Spyder RT, and to my surprise it was a great improvement.</li>
      <li>I had a great ride home and didn&#x27;t have to keep asking my boyfriend to stop every hour</li>
      <li>Seriously, he is impressed and appreciative.</li>
      <li>When I got to the RoHo site, I was thrilled to learn it had a two-year warranty!</li>
      <li>my but feels just as good at the end of the ride as it does at the start.  </li>
      <li>The Airhawk was a good purchase.</li>
      <li>No sore butt or shoulder pain, good product.</li>
      <li>I wish I could give this product more stars!</li>
      <li>and they couldn&#x27;t have been more pleasant.  </li>
      <li>now that i&#x27;ve used it for a year, it is easy to say that it is great, sturdy works amazingly well.</li>
      <li>When correct, the difference is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Provides good ventilation and relieves pressure points better than anything else I have every used.</li>
      <li>I ride a Harley Davidson Softail Deluxe which I had lowered because I&#x27;m vertically challenged.  </li>
      <li>I was with also used his own airhawk cushion for part of the trip and got rid of it</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t go 2 miles when I realized this is nice</li>
      <li>The Airhawk Seat Cushion was shipped promptly and is very comfortable.</li>
      <li>but it has just enough air in it and works wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>more comfort in the saddle for a longer period of time.  </li>
      <li>I could not be more satisfied.    </li>
      <li>I found my best comfort only has about 6-7psi in the cushion.</li>
      <li>Not only does the product work as advertised, the company backs it up with an excellent warranty.     </li>
      <li>Most of the longer rides were 200 to 300 miles in a day, for reference.  </li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;ll work on sweaty days, but I can&#x27;t believe it won&#x27;t be a lot better than going without.</li>
      <li>Be sure to follow directions for inflation.  </li>
      <li>after so many miles</li>
      <li>If you spend more than six hours a day in the saddle, even the stitching can feel like you&#x27;re sitting on a block of wood.</li>
      <li>I loved my Roho Airhawk motorcycle seat cushion from the first time I tried it out.  </li>
      <li>They were both awesome while they stayed inflated but that didn&#x27;t happen for long.     </li>
      <li>Great product, easy to use, makes my hubby&#x27;s butt feel like it&#x27;s new again!</li>
      <li>This is the best money that I have spent on my BMW R1200 RT.  </li>
      <li>While I never had a problem with it, I would&#x27;ve felt safer if the flimsy \\&quot;bra-strap\\&quot; pieces included were connected more securely.</li>
      <li>Thanks for a really good product.</li>
      <li>It stays put and goes on and off easily.</li>
      <li>but I easily doubled my riding time.  </li>
      <li>Access to the adjusting valve would be easier if it were up front rather than at the rear, but still works fine.</li>
      <li>This air filled seat cushion will save your butt on a motorcycle, but I found it to be too squishy.</li>
      <li>The air cushion created by the internal baffles are amazing!</li>
      <li>Truthfully, I was already convinced I&#x27;d probably dump it in the first rest area garbage can I found.</li>
      <li>I have talked to several people y types of cushions they used and I think by far this is the best.  </li>
      <li>It takes some time to get the air adjusted to optimum pressure, however, once adjusted properly, it definitely improves the quality of my ride.</li>
      <li>When properly inflated it works pretty good</li>
      <li>A $150+ cushion should last for more than 2 years!</li>
      <li>well worth it after getting use to it, would buy it again</li>
      <li>Within 3 hours, riding was no longer fun</li>
      <li>I tried a gel pad, but without success.  </li>
      <li>part way through saying it didn&#x27;t work signifantly and wasn&#x27;t worth the cost.</li>
      <li>The only improvement could be a more secure way to attach.</li>
      <li>The medium pad is just the right size to cover the driver&#x27;s section of the Sundowner.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sitting on it right now at my computer.  </li>
      <li>My first reaction was I can&#x27;t</li>
      <li>But, my tailbone combined with the hot seat in 95F weather after 2 hours I would crawl off my bike.  </li>
      <li>and i use it mostly to commute back and forth between work and home.</li>
      <li>My first trip let me ride 90 minutes</li>
      <li>By the end of the first 200 miles and not a sore spot anywhere, I knew I&#x27;d hit the jackpot.</li>
      <li>rode my honda rebel from new york city to main over the summer and my but felt fine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve owned 2 deifferent \\&quot;large cruiser\\&quot; size airhawks.</li>
      <li>I sit in the passenger seat and by the time we got to our destination (1600 km), I was almost doing calisthenics on the back of that bike trying to find a comfortable position because my butt and legs were in so much pain.  </li>
      <li>Airhawk works very well.  </li>
      <li>Too much air</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t wait for the next traffic light or gas stop.  </li>
      <li>It is critically important that you inflate this properly.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I did follow manufactures recommendations regarding inflation and experimented with varying the air level.no real improvements.</li>
      <li>When it is under inflated it really doesn&#x27;t help much at all.  </li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>For the 145.00 cost I expected more.</li>
      <li>Made for a more comfortable ride except it feels a little odd like your butt is not as secure to the bike as without.  </li>
      <li>Spend the extra money on the original version like this one.     </li>
      <li>Sent it back for a full refund and purchased a Mustang seat.</li>
      <li>its a lot cheaper than buying a whole new seat.  </li>
      <li>I later ordered the ErgoSeet Airflow Seat Cushion that I like much better, and which I constantly employ on all four of my motorcycles.</li>
      <li>I used this all Summer on my Harley Davidson Heritage Softail Classic.  </li>
      <li>The key is getting the proper inflation which is easily adjusted.  </li>
      <li>I called in to find out the return policy, and they told me just to ship it to them, regardless of condition, and they&#x27;d send me a new one.</li>
      <li>I live up in the north part of the US</li>
      <li>It feels comfortable on my daily commute, and is definitely an improvement over the BMW R1200 GS seat.  </li>
      <li>My 1st one went flat right after the warranty expired.</li>
      <li>One added bonus, the way it works, transferring air between individual bladders, I&#x27;m able to exercise my lower back, front to back and side to side while I&#x27;m riding.</li>
      <li>I finally got someone higher up in the roho company and he agreed to send me another cushion.     </li>
      <li>By the end of the first block I knew this was something different.</li>
      <li>This most recent trip had no hot days</li>
      <li>I have used this air hawk cushion for the first time for a cross country ride from Az.</li>
      <li>took a little while to figure out how to make it work best, which is start empty and only add a little air.</li>
      <li>I shipped the old one to them</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it has anything to do with me being 60yrs old, maybe it does.</li>
      <li>When the day came for my first long trip I dutifully attached it with the accompanying straps, loaded up the rest of my bags and pulled out of the garage.</li>
      <li>Took me two tries to find the right point.  </li>
      <li>then down trying to find the right comfort.</li>
      <li>I also read lots of reviews of it and other products that seemed promising.</li>
      <li>FINALLY a product that really works for the long term as well as the short term.  </li>
      <li>My seat was not as hot and sweaty and my tailbone a little sore but nothing like it used to be.  </li>
      <li>It provides considerable comfort over the stock seat for long distance rides.  </li>
      <li>While this cushion performed better than expected (after having tried numerous other padding types), it left a little to be desired with regards to attaching it to the bike.  </li>
      <li>The relief is instant and following the manufacturer&#x27;s directions, the product does exactly what it is supposed to do- relieve soreness and pressure points from riding on a too stiff motorcycle seat.</li>
      <li>My butt began to go numb at the end of the first day, and this numbness spread wider and wider until by the end of my three weeks on the road, there was a significant area, on both cheeks, where I could feel anything.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been happily using this product since April of 2008, but recently it got a tiny hole in a very awkward spot to patch.</li>

    <li> I wish I could give this product more stars! Not only does the product work as advertised, the company backs it up with an excellent warranty.     I&#x27;ve been happily using this product since April of 2008, but recently it got a tiny hole in a very awkward spot to patch. After many failed attempts to patch it, I gave up and was looking for replacement options (but didn&#x27;t want to have to buy another one). When I got to the RoHo site, I was thrilled to learn it had a two-year warranty! I called in to find out the return policy, and they told me just to ship it to them, regardless of condition, and they&#x27;d send me a new one. I shipped the old one to them (bad patch-job and all), and got a brand new one in the mail in less than 2 weeks.    I only wish all companies took care of their customers like this. They&#x27;ve got a customer for life!</li>
    <li> After only a couple of weeks I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had enough riding time to write a valid review.  It feels comfortable on my daily commute, and is definitely an improvement over the BMW R1200 GS seat.  I&#x27;m taking a 5,000 mile trip in about a month and will update this review when I return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2004, I took a 9,000 mile trip across the US without the Airhawk; I rode about 10 hours each day.  My butt began to go numb at the end of the first day, and this numbness spread wider and wider until by the end of my three weeks on the road, there was a significant area, on both cheeks, where I could feel anything.  And this condition lasted for two months afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Summer of 2010, I did a 4,100 mile trip through Canada, again spending about 10 hours in the saddle each day.  I didn&#x27;t feel any numbness at all, and only the slightest tingling sensation after about day four.  But even though I started noticing the tingling, by the next morning it was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Airhawk works very well.  I leave it on my bike all the time--even for city commutes.  In addition to the Airhawk, I recommend that you wear a riding suite; and inside your suit you wear either sweat pants or pants with no rear pockets.  If you spend more than six hours a day in the saddle, even the stitching can feel like you&#x27;re sitting on a block of wood.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned 2 deifferent \\&quot;large cruiser\\&quot; size airhawks. They were both awesome while they stayed inflated but that didn&#x27;t happen for long.     My 1st one went flat right after the warranty expired. I called and they fought me tooth and nail when I asked for a replacement. A $150+ cushion should last for more than 2 years! Otherwise, I&#x27;d could just buy a bunch of gel seats or other cycle seats that can&#x27;t deflate... for a lot less money.     I finally got someone higher up in the roho company and he agreed to send me another cushion.     Well, I&#x27;ve been using that cushion sparingly for less than a year and it now won&#x27;t hold air.     These things are very comfy when they&#x27;re inflated but they&#x27;re useless when they won&#x27;t hold air.     For $150+, an item should last a lot longer than 1-2 years.     I give the roho airhawk a 2 out of 5.</li>
    <li> I purchased the AirHawk after trying gel pads, sheepskin covers, other seats etc.  FINALLY a product that really works for the long term as well as the short term.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if I do 300 miles a day or 600 miles a day on the bike, my but feels just as good at the end of the ride as it does at the start.  Why didn&#x27;t I find this sooner.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical of this product and after many sore rides lasting an hour or less.  I gave the Airhawk a try- now I wish I had purchased the product last year.  The relief is instant and following the manufacturer&#x27;s directions, the product does exactly what it is supposed to do- relieve soreness and pressure points from riding on a too stiff motorcycle seat.</li>
    <li> I loved my Roho Airhawk motorcycle seat cushion from the first time I tried it out.  I followed the simple directions for inflation and have never had to adjust it since.  I ride a Harley Davidson Softail Deluxe which I had lowered because I&#x27;m vertically challenged.  Consequently the ride is a lot harder now and it was killing my back to ride for long distances.  This cushion is the answer to my dreams!  I can ride now for hours without pain.  I only wish I would have bought it before we took a 6,000 mile trip earlier this summer.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Does everything it claims to do.  Provides good ventilation and relieves pressure points better than anything else I have every used.</li>
    <li> Just received this remedy for the &#x27;iron butt&#x27; sore you know what in January.  I live up in the north part of the US so I can&#x27;t comment on riding with it yet.  I have however, tried this Airhawk seat in my truck and in my office chair.  I like it because all the air pads &#x27;adjust&#x27; to your weight shifting in the seat!</li>
    <li> I purchased this cushion for my Suzuki Burgman Exec.  It provides considerable comfort over the stock seat for long distance rides.  The key is getting the proper inflation which is easily adjusted.  The only improvement could be a more secure way to attach.</li>
    <li> This cushion is just not what I was looking for. It had a very slow leak that left me having to adjust the air in it every day. When properly inflated it works pretty good but it is a PITA (pardon the pun) to properly adjust the air. Has to be done by trial and error. Too much air and you&#x27;re unstable siting on the cushion (tippy) Too little air and it doesn&#x27;t keep you from getting a sore butt. While it may work well for some, it was a disappointment as far as I&#x27;m concerned. Sent it back for a full refund and purchased a Mustang seat. Now there&#x27;s something that is expensive but well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This airhawk  does what it says it would do.....more comfort in the saddle for a longer period of time.  It did raise me up a bit on the seat, but just a bit.  I would recommend it to anyone....its a lot cheaper than buying a whole new seat.  But if you don&#x27;t want to be raised up at all, well, you would need to buy a custom lowered seat.      I rode on a trip for 4 hours each way with it on the bike, made a big difference!  I ordered the model that was big enough for any of my motorcycle seats so I\\&quot;m &#x27;covered&#x27; no matter which I take!</li>
    <li> I used this all Summer on my Harley Davidson Heritage Softail Classic.  Most of the longer rides were 200 to 300 miles in a day, for reference.  I have lower back problems due to arthritis and typically within an hour of riding the pain would begin.  Within 3 hours, riding was no longer fun and I couldn&#x27;t wait for the next traffic light or gas stop.  With the Airhawk I didn&#x27;t start to feel any discomfort at all until about 3 hours of constant riding.  I learned that shifting my position a bit could extend that even longer.  It does double or triple your ride time as claimed.  This beats out any gel cushion I&#x27;ve tried.  This product seems to be made very well and the neoprene seems so thick I can&#x27;t imagine how badly you would have to mistreat it to damage it.  I have a non-neoprene Airhawk 2 cushion for the passenger seat and it seems much less rugged.  I don&#x27;t recommend the Airhawk 2 for anyone that rides a lot.  Spend the extra money on the original version like this one.     Mine was missing the puncture repair kit (not that I&#x27;ve needed it).  I called Roho customer support and they couldn&#x27;t have been more pleasant.  They immediately sent a replacement kit at no charge.    It is critically important that you inflate this properly.  It&#x27;s not that hard to figure out either.  Took me two tries to find the right point.  When it is under inflated it really doesn&#x27;t help much at all.  When correct, the difference is amazing.  And unlike some, I don&#x27;t even find it uncomfortable to be overinflated which makes you glide side to side a bit on turns.</li>
    <li> I bought my Airhawk on the advice of a friend who similarly takes to the road for days on end and lots of miles between home and back again. I also read lots of reviews of it and other products that seemed promising. I had a case of sticker shock at the price, but figured there was no way to know without trying it and I thought I needed to do something. When it arrived I was underwhelmed when I tried it in the garage, but adjusted it like the directions said, sat a few minutes, then put it back in the box. When the day came for my first long trip I dutifully attached it with the accompanying straps, loaded up the rest of my bags and pulled out of the garage. Truthfully, I was already convinced I&#x27;d probably dump it in the first rest area garbage can I found. By the end of the first block I knew this was something different. By the end of the first 200 miles and not a sore spot anywhere, I knew I&#x27;d hit the jackpot. 1800 miles after that I wondered where this thing had been all my life. It really works. I adjusted it just like the directions said, about 1/2\\&quot; off the seat and never touched the air valve again. It stays put and goes on and off easily. The only downside is that it renders my candy-a$$ seat heater ineffective, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay. This most recent trip had no hot days so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;ll work on sweaty days, but I can&#x27;t believe it won&#x27;t be a lot better than going without. That&#x27;s about it. It just works. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. One added bonus, the way it works, transferring air between individual bladders, I&#x27;m able to exercise my lower back, front to back and side to side while I&#x27;m riding. It makes a big difference.</li>
    <li> Made for a more comfortable ride except it feels a little odd like your butt is not as secure to the bike as without.  Also the cost of the thing is outlandish. It&#x27;s just a flat sheet of rubber with a dozen airbags on the other side.</li>
    <li> This air filled seat cushion will save your butt on a motorcycle, but I found it to be too squishy. I later ordered the ErgoSeet Airflow Seat Cushion that I like much better, and which I constantly employ on all four of my motorcycles.</li>
    <li> I recently went on a 3200 Km (approx. 2000 miles)bike trip.  I sit in the passenger seat and by the time we got to our destination (1600 km), I was almost doing calisthenics on the back of that bike trying to find a comfortable position because my butt and legs were in so much pain.  Even though we made stops on the way, I actually dreaded getting back on the bike.  Before we made the ride back home (another 1600 km), I bought an \\&quot;Air Hawk R\\&quot;.  It has saved my butt!  Sometimes I actually feel like I&#x27;m sitting on silk.  You can feel the coolness in your butt if it starts to go the least bit numb because the circulation is going back in your butt to take away the numbness.  Every time you move the slightest bit, the seat is allowing circulation in your butt.  I had a great ride home and didn&#x27;t have to keep asking my boyfriend to stop every hour so I could painfully get off the bike.  Thank you, Air Hawk!!</li>
    <li> I had to adjust inflation several times and ways going up and then down trying to find the right comfort. I found my best comfort only has about 6-7psi in the cushion. Plus not to slide it all the way back behind my buttocks. I must keep it under and in front slightly because by sliding it to far behind it held my back in position to where my back was uncomfortable. But after discovering the perfect placement and psi I use this pillion on every ride when leaving town.</li>
    <li> i got this last year and wanted to wait to review it. now that i&#x27;ve used it for a year, it is easy to say that it is great, sturdy works amazingly well. took a little while to figure out how to make it work best, which is start empty and only add a little air. looking at it you would think it is empty but it has just enough air in it and works wonderfully.  rode my honda rebel from new york city to main over the summer and my but felt fine. i know it is only a 250, but hell it gets 75 mile to the gallon and i use it mostly to commute back and forth between work and home.</li>
    <li> This is the best money that I have spent on my BMW R1200 RT.  Be sure to follow directions for inflation.  You want to sit in the cushion, not on it.      I could not be more satisfied.    Maurice Bowen  Chattanooga, TN</li>
    <li> I have talked to several people y types of cushions they used and I think by far this is the best.  I have ridden one way as far as 800 miles and my back side is not near as tired as with just the stock seat on Ultra Classic.</li>
    <li> Went on a 1500 mile road trip from Boise to Southern Utah in June 2012. The seat cushion was a godsend. No sore butt or shoulder pain, good product.</li>
    <li> Little preciey but well worth it after getting use to it, would buy it again</li>
    <li> The seat pan for the post-2004 Sportster Low is an incredibly uncomfortable design.  Replacing the original seat with a Sundowner was a slight improvement, but my butt was still numb after about an hour.  I tried a gel pad, but without success.  I was not interested in spending $600 for a custom seat and then HOPE it helped.  So after reading the reviews, I decided to try the Airhawk.  The medium pad is just the right size to cover the driver&#x27;s section of the Sundowner.  A little trial and error was used to determine the air needed, but adding what appears to be about 1/2 inch in height made a world of difference.  My first trip let me ride 90 minutes and I was still comfortable and not the least bit numb.  (A herniated disk only lets me ride about 90 minutes without a break.)  Because of the seat pan design, I still somewhat slide towards the gas tank during the course of a trip, but without the Airhawk, I was re-adjusting my position every few minutes.  The Airhawk was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I hesitated and hesitated buying the Air Hawk thinking I would get used to my sore butt and tailbone. I tried and tried.  It didn&#x27;t  matter if I rode my Harley Softtail, Lowrider or CVO Softail, after 2 hours or longer my tailbone was screaming. I don&#x27;t think it has anything to do with me being 60yrs old, maybe it does. But, my tailbone combined with the hot seat in 95F weather after 2 hours I would crawl off my bike.  So I broke down and ordered one.  The day before it came I rode my bicycle 20 miles and had a really sore tailbone, I could hardly sit down.  The next day the Air Hawk came and so did my riding friend wanting to ride.  My first reaction was I can&#x27;t I can hardly sit much less ride.  But I took the Air Hawk out, blew it up a little, like the instructions said, put it on my Lowrider crawled on my bike and off we went. I didn&#x27;t go 2 miles when I realized this is nice, I want one of these for my bicycle!  We rode about 150 miles that day in the summer heat, highways, stop and go city driving and some country riding.  When we got home, I can&#x27;t say that my tailbone and butt were not sore (they were sore before I left) but I easily doubled my riding time.  Of course my friend was curious about the Air Hawk and I told him if something happens to this thing I will buy another one.  Days latter (no sore tailbone) I went riding for maybe 3 hours and what a difference.  My seat was not as hot and sweaty and my tailbone a little sore but nothing like it used to be.  I&#x27;m sitting on it right now at my computer.  Thanks for a really good product.</li>
    <li> This is the best investment I have made in my motorcycle career! It will basically remove the \\&quot;fatigue\\&quot; factor from your body. While others will be exhausted and achy, you will be ready to ride on! The air cushion created by the internal baffles are amazing! You have to try this product. My riding buddies are buying them now.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use, makes my hubby&#x27;s butt feel like it&#x27;s new again! Seriously, he is impressed and appreciative. He rides every single day, so depends on comfort down under.</li>
    <li> While this cushion performed better than expected (after having tried numerous other padding types), it left a little to be desired with regards to attaching it to the bike.  While I never had a problem with it, I would&#x27;ve felt safer if the flimsy \\&quot;bra-strap\\&quot; pieces included were connected more securely.</li>
    <li> The Airhawk Seat Cushion was shipped promptly and is very comfortable. It will definitely extend the range of my motorcycle rides. It takes some time to get the air adjusted to optimum pressure, however, once adjusted properly, it definitely improves the quality of my ride.</li>
    <li> I bought this cushion for my Canam Spyder RT, and to my surprise it was a great improvement. Due to the seat configuration only the front tie downs are used and the cushion stays in place quite well.  Access to the adjusting valve would be easier if it were up front rather than at the rear, but still works fine. I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> I have used this air hawk cushion for the first time for a cross country ride from Az. To Washington d.c. in hopes of providing some relief for the long journey.Granted I did 600 to 700 mile days as I was trying to make time&lt;br /&gt;,however after so many miles the pad did little to provide signicant relieve.another rider I was with also used his own airhawk cushion for part of the trip and got rid of it part way through saying it didn&#x27;t work signifantly and wasn&#x27;t worth the cost.I have to agree and I will be returning it and look at other options on the market.For the 145.00 cost I expected more.I did follow manufactures recommendations regarding inflation and experimented with varying the air level.no real improvements.</li>
