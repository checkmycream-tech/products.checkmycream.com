      <li>(I&#x27;m so glad I tried it anyway!)&lt;br</li>
      <li>He had used many prescription and non-prescription creams for his foot fungus that had spread to his legs.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic skin protectant!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products and was running out of products to try.....</li>
      <li>After using Secura cream, his feet and legs looked better than they had in years.</li>
      <li>The secret to this stuff&#x27;s effectiveness is its incredible thickness, and thus incredible moisture barrier properties.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and easy to wash off.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
      <li>It is pasty and sticks great, as opposed to the other over teh counter stuff that wipes off so easy.</li>
      <li>One good coating of this product and it Stopped all night and into the next morning!  </li>
      <li>Took it on our trip to the tropics, luckily didn&#x27;t need it.</li>
      <li>He is quite surprised and pleased.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It may not work for everyone, or on all types of hemorrhoids, but it might be worth a try on the itchy or burning types.  </li>
      <li>The results though, might be worth the inconvenience.</li>
      <li>I put a little of this wherever I have heat irritation and within one day It is better, I love it.</li>
      <li>Be aware of that.</li>
      <li>The cost is more than regular diaper cream</li>
      <li>I recommend adding this to your first aid kit if you take care of people who have the tendency for fungal infection.</li>
      <li>And it worked FAST.</li>
      <li>Better than expected.</li>
      <li>It does leave a chalky grease on your hands when applied, I always have dish soap ready to wash it off.</li>
      <li>For real.</li>
      <li>much better than any other ringworm cream.  </li>
      <li>but like many other comments about this product, it does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After a couple of weeks, the itching has decreased remarkably.  </li>
      <li>I did not have high hopes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s even kind of hard to wash off your hands with soap after applying.</li>
      <li>Yes it is extremely thick but found if you warm it the consistancy thins and is&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
      <li>I have had allergic skin since I was a year old when I was covered with rashes.</li>
      <li>Bedsores healed completely in five days with pain gone in two.</li>
      <li>I am glad it can be ordered via Amazon because it is not readily available in the local drugstores.</li>
      <li>It also is 2% miconazole, which is basically every other $5 OTC cream you can buy at the grocery store and that I had already tried without success.</li>
      <li>Thick chalky skin coating cream that can be easily washed off in the shower.</li>
      <li>I squeezed and sqeezed and barely got some out.</li>
      <li>We have been dealing with external melenoma tumors on my eighty two year old father.</li>
      <li>When it arrived, since my husband had been having trouble with very itchy hemorrhoids and had had no real luck with several other remedies, he decided to give this cream a try as it was supposed to be able to help with itching and burning sensations.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Miracles there is pink new skin showing after two applications.</li>

<li> It is obviously not a cure, as diet and life style play into the overall causes, but the cost is minimal comparatively.</li>
<li> It takes a long time to apply to the skin, but it does stay put and you literally have to scrub it off.</li>
<li> Much too thick for me.</li>
<li> This stuff applies very easy and stays put, and it also doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell to it at all...</li>
<li> Its off-white stains are less problematic using white underwear.  </li>
<li> I thought the Extra Thick was part of the advertising slogan and didn&#x27;t realize this must be NEW and is extra thick.  </li>
<li> (think diapers ladies), it seals off the skin so it can heal, helps chapped private spots on little boys, etc.  </li>
<li> The cap was not safety sealed, but instead closed with a piece of scotch tape.</li>
<li> This company&#x27;s Extra Protective Cream worked so well on my pressure sore, that my husband thought we should probably have some of its Antifungal Extra Thick cream on hand too.  </li>
<li> This cream was extremely thick and worked miracles on my eighty-year old father.  </li>
<li> My husband has a rash problem and I switch between  this product and other products in this line.</li>
<li> This product protects those delicate parts of the body that do not get enough air flow and are prone to irritation.  </li>
<li> Be aware though, as with the company&#x27;s EPC cream, this is thick, sticky/greasy, off-white colored stuff which does stain clothes and is difficult to wash out.</li>
<li> After weeks and weeks of no relief even from prescriptions or steroids, I saw an improvement after the very first application of Secura, and it cleared my awful infection completely within 3 days.</li>
<li> few days after applying the itch was gone...</li>
<li> I have a fungal infection that has not responded well to the ordinary over the counter medications.</li>
<li> It is &amp;#34;Extra Thick&amp;#34; and is a bit hard to wash off your hands after application.</li>
<li> It was hard getting the cream out.</li>
<li> It protects delicate skin and brings immediate relief.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s THICK.</li>
<li> This makes it a little difficult to apply to broken skin, as it tends to pull.</li>
<li> Very hard to spread.  </li>
<li> This is very thick.  </li>
<li> works well, but very thick...</li>
<li> I am particularly susceptible to skin yeast infections, and Secura cured one of the worst ones where everything else failed!</li>
<li> I use a piece of paper towel rather than my fingers since it is difficult to wash off.</li>
<li> Last couple months,  my arms have been horribly itchy, and I&#x27;ve torn them up scratching.</li>
<li> This stuff is very very very thick!!!</li>
<li> My son had a horrible diaper rash from antibiotics when he was an infant</li>
<li> I bought this because I was working with someone who had a horrible skin breakdown from an infected surgical site.</li>

    <li> Excellent Product, noted improvement in 4 days !</li>
    <li> This product was given to my grandmother when she was in the hospital for not public parts that needed protection from moisture, heat, friction, clothing, etc.  My son had a horrible diaper rash from antibiotics when he was an infant and I tried this. It is awesome.  Moisture cannot get through it (think diapers ladies), it seals off the skin so it can heal, helps chapped private spots on little boys, etc.  I always use this and buy it again as soon as I get low.  They should advertise this stuff as diaper cream!  The cost is more than regular diaper cream but it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
    <li> This is good stuff had a heat rash and within 2 days cleared it all up.  It is easy to apply and easy to wash off.</li>
    <li> This company&#x27;s Extra Protective Cream worked so well on my pressure sore, that my husband thought we should probably have some of its Antifungal Extra Thick cream on hand too.  When it arrived, since my husband had been having trouble with very itchy hemorrhoids and had had no real luck with several other remedies, he decided to give this cream a try as it was supposed to be able to help with itching and burning sensations. After applying it for a week, it definitely seemed to be helping. After a couple of weeks, the itching has decreased remarkably.  He is quite surprised and pleased. We&#x27;ll see how it does over an extended time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not work for everyone, or on all types of hemorrhoids, but it might be worth a try on the itchy or burning types.  It is obviously not a cure, as diet and life style play into the overall causes, but the cost is minimal comparatively. Be aware though, as with the company&#x27;s EPC cream, this is thick, sticky/greasy, off-white colored stuff which does stain clothes and is difficult to wash out. Its off-white stains are less problematic using white underwear.  The results though, might be worth the inconvenience.</li>
    <li> I have a fungal infection that has not responded well to the ordinary over the counter medications. My Dr prescribed a prescription medication that was very expensive, I started using Secura and it is healing nicely, it worked better than the expensive prescription that had to be formulated.</li>
    <li> I am particularly susceptible to skin yeast infections, and Secura cured one of the worst ones where everything else failed! OTC creams, lotions, powders, sprays, I tried it all. Prescription creams, even steroid combinations, nothing worked until I tried Secura. And it worked FAST. I would recommend it to anyone, it&#x27;s that good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* When I recieved my product, I was, shall we say, underwhelmed. The cap was not safety sealed, but instead closed with a piece of scotch tape. It also is 2% miconazole, which is basically every other $5 OTC cream you can buy at the grocery store and that I had already tried without success. I did not have high hopes. (I&#x27;m so glad I tried it anyway!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The secret to this stuff&#x27;s effectiveness is its incredible thickness, and thus incredible moisture barrier properties. It&#x27;s THICK. Like putty, or clay. This makes it a little difficult to apply to broken skin, as it tends to pull. However it covers skin magnificently and soothingly. Nothing is getting through that barrier after it is on! It&#x27;s even kind of hard to wash off your hands with soap after applying. Your skin WILL stay protected and medicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* After weeks and weeks of no relief even from prescriptions or steroids, I saw an improvement after the very first application of Secura, and it cleared my awful infection completely within 3 days. For real. This stuff is amazing. Use it anywhere yeast is a problem in moisture-prone areas. Don&#x27;t be put off by the ghetto packaging. It&#x27;s a fantastic skin protectant!</li>
    <li> Better than expected.</li>
    <li> This cream is a life saver in summer for me, because I get irritated under my bra from the heat of summer and moisture.  I put a little of this wherever I have heat irritation and within one day It is better, I love it.</li>
    <li> This is very thick.  Very hard to spread.  Is still there after 12 hours.  I use it for ringworm.  I would recommend</li>
    <li> Took it on our trip to the tropics, luckily didn&#x27;t need it. I am glad it can be ordered via Amazon because it is not readily available in the local drugstores. I recommend adding this to your first aid kit if you take care of people who have the tendency for fungal infection.</li>
    <li> I have had allergic skin since I was a year old when I was covered with rashes. Last couple months,  my arms have been horribly itchy, and I&#x27;ve torn them up scratching. Tried all kinds of sprays, and ointments. One good coating of this product and it Stopped all night and into the next morning!  What makes it work is the thickness. I used alcohol to wipe the cream off my fingers , then washed with soap. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> We have been dealing with external melenoma tumors on my eighty two year old father. This stuff works&lt;br /&gt;Miracles there is pink new skin showing after two applications. This will not be a cure for the cancer but is&lt;br /&gt;A life saver for caregivers. Yes it is extremely thick but found if you warm it the consistancy thins and is&lt;br /&gt;Much easier to spread. Bedsores healed completely in five days with pain gone in two. Don&#x27;t hesitate to&lt;br /&gt;Use this product.</li>
    <li> works well, but very thick...I use a piece of paper towel rather than my fingers since it is difficult to wash off.</li>
    <li> This product protects those delicate parts of the body that do not get enough air flow and are prone to irritation.  I did not need repeated applications.  It protects delicate skin and brings immediate relief.  It is &amp;#34;Extra Thick&amp;#34; and is a bit hard to wash off your hands after application.</li>
    <li> This stuff applies very easy and stays put, and it also doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell to it at all...</li>
    <li> this stuff is great.  much better than any other ringworm cream.  It is pasty and sticks great, as opposed to the other over teh counter stuff that wipes off so easy.</li>
    <li> This cream was extremely thick and worked miracles on my eighty-year old father.  He had used many prescription and non-prescription creams for his foot fungus that had spread to his legs.  The nurses used it during a hospital stay and I searched to find it.  After using Secura cream, his feet and legs looked better than they had in years.</li>
    <li> It was hard getting the cream out. I squeezed and sqeezed and barely got some out. It sure stays where you put it. I don&#x27;t think I will be buying this again. Much too thick for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was working with someone who had a horrible skin breakdown from an infected surgical site. It is amazing.</li>
    <li> My husband has a rash problem and I switch between  this product and other products in this line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products and was running out of products to try.....but like many other comments about this product, it does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days after applying the itch was gone...I do use it as sort of a maintenance once a week, especially as it get warmer.</li>
    <li> I thought the Extra Thick was part of the advertising slogan and didn&#x27;t realize this must be NEW and is extra thick.  I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is very very very thick!!! Be aware of that. It takes a long time to apply to the skin, but it does stay put and you literally have to scrub it off. It has made a difference in the skin issue, but it did not solve the problem.</li>
    <li> Me &amp; my husband have used this for years. Excellent product, fast relief. Thick chalky skin coating cream that can be easily washed off in the shower. It does leave a chalky grease on your hands when applied, I always have dish soap ready to wash it off.</li>
