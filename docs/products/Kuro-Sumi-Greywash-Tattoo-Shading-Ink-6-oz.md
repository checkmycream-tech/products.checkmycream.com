<li> No major problems.</li>
<li> I enjoy the greywash a lot, and have even used it as a liner sometimes, when i&#x27;m trying to do black and gray pieces that i don&#x27;t want to have a hard black edge on.  </li>
<li> I would highly recommend Kuro-Sumi Graywash ink because I have used other gray inks in the past for coloring in gray areas and they haven&#x27;t stood out like this kuro sumi stuff does.</li>
<li> or it just looks like your using regular black ink to shade</li>
<li> and now I have to play tag with the incompetent seller to send me the correct item I purchased. .</li>
<li> WTF?!</li>

    <li> great product.  quick shipping</li>
    <li> Was recommended this ink by a tattooist of 25 years when I got started. Goes in great and have never had a problem with it. Even held up on a foot tat I did that dropped into the arch of the foot. I can honestly say as long as I sling ink and this product is around I will never use anything else to out line with</li>
