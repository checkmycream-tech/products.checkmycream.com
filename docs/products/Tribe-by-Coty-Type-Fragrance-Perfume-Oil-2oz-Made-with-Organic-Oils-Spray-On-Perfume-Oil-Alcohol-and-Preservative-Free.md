      <li>I will most definitely be back for more and will be telling several friends about it too.</li>
      <li>will be placing another order very soon ...&lt;br /&gt;Tisha from Franklinton,La</li>
      <li>smells ok but not really tribe smell.</li>
      <li>Smells like the real thing</li>
      <li>The scent is so strong it lasts all day long ....</li>
      <li>I would not purchase this particular scent again.</li>
      <li>but i suppose because it&#x27;s an oil you can&#x27;t really smell it unless you put your nose right next to where you spray it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little more licorice smelling than I remember though.</li>
      <li>This oil comes the closest to the old &amp;#34;Tribe&amp;#34; perfume!  </li>
      <li>WOW ALL I CAN SAY ....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very oily, and does smell a tad bit like it, but definitely not a replicate.</li>
      <li>Middle school and high school wore it all the time.</li>
      <li>Only issue is the high cost of shipping but that is no reflection on the product.</li>
      <li>I ordered this in hopes it would be similar to the old &amp;#34;tribe&amp;#34; cologne.</li>

    <li> scent last a long time. smells ok but not really tribe smell.</li>
    <li> Long- lasting. Excellent quality.</li>
    <li> The scent is perfect and lasts all day! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the spray bottle- the first time I used it the oil went EVERYWHERE when it sprayed (it comes out in a forceful stream rather than a mist like you would expect from a spray bottle). To avoid this, I unscrew the top and use the &amp;#34;dipstick&amp;#34; to apply to my hands.&lt;br /&gt;A packing re-design is needed!</li>
    <li> I ordered this in hopes it would be similar to the old &amp;#34;tribe&amp;#34; cologne. It&#x27;s very oily, and does smell a tad bit like it, but definitely not a replicate. I would not purchase this particular scent again.</li>
    <li> OMG! I just received my Tribe perfume oil and it is unbelievable! My wonderful hubby saw this and ordered it for me, knowing I had been looking for it for quite awhile. I suggest to anyone that has been looking for this scent, BUY IT NOW! I  haven&#x27;t managed to stop sniffing myself for hours! Many thanks to Sweet Essentials for this one! I will most definitely be back for more and will be telling several friends about it too.</li>
    <li> This was not the scent I was hoping for. Its still in the box sadly I will never use it. And there is a  no return policy.</li>
    <li> My wife loved this product.</li>
    <li> This oil is the closest I&#x27;ve gotten to smelling like Tribe by Coty since I found it on ebay in the mid 2000s. It smells great. It isn&#x27;t overpowering. It doesn&#x27;t smell fake or chemically as some imitation perfumes do. I&#x27;m so glad to found this- I&#x27;ve been wearing it every day.</li>
    <li> WOW ALL I CAN SAY .... YOU HAVE GAVE ME BACK MY TRIBE ..... The scent is so strong it lasts all day long ....&lt;br /&gt;I will be placing another order very soon ...&lt;br /&gt;Tisha from Franklinton,La</li>

    <li> Smells just like Tribe!! Scent stays for a long time on skin, which is great. Application is the tricky part, it comes in a spray bottle but doesn&#x27;t spray.... doesn&#x27;t stop me from wearing it everyday thou.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!  This oil comes the closest to the old &amp;#34;Tribe&amp;#34; perfume!  Great service, too...I&#x27;ll be ordering more - so glad to have found Sweet Essentials! This used to be my signature scent, and now I&#x27;ve (almost) got it back.</li>
