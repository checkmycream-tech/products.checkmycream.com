    <li> Been using it for a few years.  Love that it can be layered for a thicker, fuller lash.</li>
    <li> Great mascara, I just love the way it goes on my lashes without clumping, and my lashes feel soft.&lt;br /&gt;Rachel</li>
    <li> Stays on all day - great mascara</li>
    <li> The absolute best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. My lashes are pretty long, but thin. This helps thicken them up, and it does add length too.  I have never had mascara flake off or smudge on me and this mascara doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge either. I Love love love this mascara!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like heavy clumpy mascara, and this one gives you that bold color without looking like you applied 5 coats!  Stays on all day and comes off easily!</li>
    <li> Mally volumizing mascara makes my lashes look fuller and stays on until I take it off.  I really like this product. I have been using this mascara for a year now.  I especially liked getting 2 in the package.  Also, a little something extra, a very cute mally make-up bag came along with my order.  Wasn&#x27;t expecting that. Nice!!  This was new, fresh, and everything was just as stated on ad.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been hooked since I first received Mally&#x27;s Volumizing Mascara as a gift. It&#x27;s the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. It gives the appearance of thicker, fuller, longer lashes and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever.  I give it to friends as gifts, they love it too</li>
    <li> I purchased my first mascara through am ally&#x27;s site and loved the product. I should have continued to buy it there. The first tube I am using is coming out all over the brush and gets all over the tube, my hands, my make up bag and leaves my lashes in clumps unless I take extra time to un clump them. I have to wipe down the tube daily. I&#x27;m hoping the second tube is better. I will never purchase this product through Amazon again! And this mascara is not cheap. It is not the same as the one purchased on the Mally site. Even the brushstroke shape is different. This is truly a case of buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Mally&#x27;s Mascara is the absolute best mascara I have ever used. Will not use anything else after using Mally&#x27;s products and you won&#x27;t either if you try them. Deserves more than 5 stars!!!!!</li>
    <li> For me, the Mally mascara is wonderful!!!!  Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great mascara. Very moisturizing!!</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara ever</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good mascara.  It goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t clump.  I wish I didn&#x27;t need to use two coats though.</li>
    <li> on time, right before the 4th....thank you so much...&lt;br /&gt;this is the best little product, just what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you again</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara available!  I&#x27;ve been using if for almost two years now.  It lengthens, volumizes, and makes lashes look their best.  And it is true black, full of rich black pigments.  I have tried every mascara known to woman and am sticking with Mally Volumizing!</li>
    <li> not like as described on TV. didn&#x27;t do anything for my lashes that a store bought brans wouldn&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> Best mascara I have used in long time. It lengthens and thickens my lashes without clumpng.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara.  I&#x27;ve been using this religiously for about four years now and can&#x27;t even bring myself to use anything else.  It makes my lashes thick and separated and removes easily.  I get compliments on my eye makeup all the time.</li>
    <li> Makes your eye lashes so long. You must buy this mascara.</li>
    <li> Love Mally. HATE her products. Sorry- they just don&#x27;t deliver the results she says you will get. This mascara is heavy, thick, clumpy and will actually weigh your lashes down even after curling them with an eyelash curler. Awful product. Sticking with my drugstore brand that works better than any more expensive mascara.</li>
