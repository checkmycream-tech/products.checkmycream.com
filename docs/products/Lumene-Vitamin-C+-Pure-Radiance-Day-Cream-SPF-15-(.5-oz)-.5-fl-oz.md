    <li> Very nice light nongreasy face cream.</li>
    <li> I knew the size of the container would be small however I couldn&#x27;t help but laugh when it finally arrived. For a second I thought that Amazon mistakenly sent an eye cream instead. The smell is pleasant and it did come with a protective seal but no box just in a plastic bag.. The container looks different than the one in the picture as well. Not sure about results as I have yet to use it for a long period of time.  Update** this stuff is great! The tiny container actually will last you for a while since you don&#x27;t need very much when you apply. I have had mine for about two weeks and it it not even half way through. It makes your skin glow, feels great and the spf is a plus! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> When I purchased Lumene at CVS, it was creamy, smelled fresh and made my face glow. This so called piece of ___ is a watered down, mixed version of God knows what. Don&#x27;t waste your money! This is not the same product purchased in stores. Sometimes it&#x27;s better to pay more $.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed thought it was larger then it was and I believe it was overpriced.  Will not make that mistake again.</li>
    <li> Nice cream, but smaller container than anticipated.  (Really big packaging, though)</li>
    <li> Makes my skin look smooth.  Love this small container - it is great for packing in your purse or suitcase for trips.</li>
    <li> Smells great!  Goes on great!  Hydrates my face during the day.  Just a very small tub that may only last me a few weeks.  Wish it was a little bigger.  Looks like it was part of a sample set.</li>
    <li> This worked really well for me. It has a citrus smell reminds me of oranges. I use it in the day and night too. My face is brighter and softer. I have purchased this twice and will again.</li>
    <li> I liked it because it&#x27;s very smooth and not greasy. It reduces skin blemishes also It has a pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> The lines between my eye brows left after using this twice a day for several weeks.  It has a fragrance so I could not use it under my eyes (made them water). I would highly recommend this for wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
    <li> I love this cream for my face..try the small one first for yourself..</li>
    <li> 2nd time I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon.  This cream keeps my skin soft and healthy looking.  Overall I am exceedingly satisfied with this ceam.  I will order again but I will opt for the larger size.</li>
    <li> This cream does a good job moisturizing and it makes your skin glow.  It&#x27;s a little greasy when you apply it, and it takes slightly longer than many other creams to blend into your skin.</li>
    <li> Love this cream! Only its a bit harsh for me to use everyday because my skin is SUPER SENSITIVE and basically everything makes me break out. Its great around the eyes however and it really did make my skin glow beautifully when I used it. I would say test it for about a week to see how it works for you before applying all over.</li>
    <li> Very greasy. I don&#x27;t care for it at all.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product.  The cream is light and feels great on my skin. I also like the fact that the product has SPF 15.  The price is very reasonable for the product.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Last time I went to the dermatologist, I asked him what I could do to reduce the appearance of dark circles under my eyes (outside of more sleep because that&#x27;s not gonna happen).  He recommended I start using the skin lightener he prescribed me for my skin under my eyes and start using a Vit C+E cream.  I was at CVS and saw this on sale (buy one for $3.99 and get the second half off) and I figured I should try it out.  Within one week...HUGE difference.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I use this cream during the day on those stubborn lines that settle in when I am tired. Miraculously, they seem to relax &amp; melt away after a few pats of Lumene. Although I have always had very sensitive skin that turns red &amp; blotchy near any gloppy creams, my face loves this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I have never had ANY problems with Lumene &amp; am now recommending it to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;Even my Dr wanted to know how I stayed looking young, so that&#x27;s definitely a good review!</li>
    <li> A very little bit goes a long way and the Lumene also has a very pleasant scent.  It&#x27;s pricey but the small size is affordable and can last quite a while.</li>
    <li> I love this! I love that it has SPF in it and that it is making my skin a lot better with each use!&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t oily or greasy, my skin soaks it all in and feels so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;The light scent is yummy!</li>
