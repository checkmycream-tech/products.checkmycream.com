### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is a great product!!!</li>
      <li>Great Product !!!!</li>
      <li>Beanstalk hair vitamins are absolutely incredible.</li>
      <li>and it is growing at an incredible rate.</li>
      <li>good!</li>
      <li>I purchased 3 bottles of BeanStalk vitamins here in Georgia two months and my girlfriend&#x27;s hair is growing and smells great...</li>
      <li>What I did not understand was the importance of nutrients for great hair health.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>This had some good reviews but didn&#x27;t  do anything for me.  </li>
      <li>and the after math of them either isnt good.</li>
      <li>now her skin and nails look good.</li>
      <li>Pretty good Gives a good healthy looking shine  to your hair.</li>
      <li>giving it more time.....</li>
      <li>most of them are breaking apart before I can take them...</li>
      <li>absolutely love it</li>
      <li>OMG I am in Love with Beanstalk Vitamins&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was very excited to receive a quick response regarding this line of products.</li>
      <li>so I could keep track of my growth and accurately determine if the vitamins work.</li>
      <li>Started using February 1st and really liked how it was gentle on the stomach.</li>
      <li>Received immediately, though, and am willing to &#x27;stay the course&#x27; in order to give it a fair and reasonable trial!</li>
      <li>Not seeing any significant amount of hair growth.</li>
      <li>Beanstalk has been totally amazing for revitalizing new hair growth.</li>
      <li>so health ,natural glow ,so loving it</li>
      <li>Since you have to take (2) vitamins per day for them to be effective, and you only get 30 capsules per bottle, that means that you would need to purchase (2) bottles for (1) month (that&#x27;s $50 not including shipping).</li>
      <li>My hair is growing, it really works!</li>
      <li>If it takes more than 2 months to work, it should sell in bottles that last that long...not going to reorder to keep trying as feel 2 months should show some effect.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve notice my hair is much stronger and shinier.  </li>
      <li>My wife&#x27;s hair was falling out by the brush full every time she brushed her hair.</li>
      <li>Back in the day I use to wear a wave cap as well as a baseball cap on top of it and due to my scalp not receiving fresh air along with clogging my hair follicles with wave grease it did a number on my hair.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product ,for women with thinning hair ,only two month now my hair is really thicking ,</li>
      <li>So far, it may actually be working, yet too early to tell how much!  </li>
      <li>my skin was perfectly clear...</li>
      <li>Planning to use this for my 5 year old daughter diagnosed with alopecia areata.</li>

<li> Planning to use this for my 5 year old daughter diagnosed with alopecia areata.</li>
<li> She did experience a minor breakout the second week but</li>
<li> I returned the product because the ingredients you advertised on Amazon were not the same amount of msg on the product I received, so I was very dissapointed to say the least.</li>
<li> She was unaware of any negative side effects with a high dosage.  </li>
<li> She now wears her hair in a braid because it has gotten so long she sits on it now.</li>
<li> I have not seen a difference in my hair it has only been 2 weeks, but my face has broken out in over 50+ tiny little white heads, just the small you can barely see unless your right up on me, looks like a rash, but still.</li>
<li> After going online and doing some research, I found that too much Biotin does cause serious cystic acne for a majority of people.  </li>
<li> Will I half a bottle left</li>
<li> Very Dry vitamins...</li>
<li> Total waste of money &amp; of course I bought 2</li>
<li> Result not as expected.</li>
<li> and I saw a difference in hair growth in less than 2 weeks</li>
<li> not sure if that is due to the vitamins or not, but</li>
<li> another go round.</li>
<li> However, I do not see hair growth, but there is no more falling out on my comb</li>
<li> My hair has just started to thin in last year and was desperate for anything to help.  </li>
<li> It is crazy, because I just dyed my hair with blonde highlights and my stylist was going crazy.</li>
<li> This for me was the worse purchase in supplements I have ever made.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s an awful lot of $$$ for only (3) months.</li>
<li> I stopped taking them because they left a nasty taste in my mouth.</li>
<li> I cant say enough how awful they taste.</li>
<li> This product created terrible cystic acne on my face, back and chest .  </li>
<li> I am sorry I purchased two bottles..</li>
<li> This was a terrible experience.</li>

    <li> Very Dry vitamins...most of them are breaking apart before I can take them...I am sorry I purchased two bottles.. These are not the same vitamins in the picture</li>
    <li> Result not as expected. Not seeing any significant amount of hair growth.</li>
    <li> Beanstalk hair vitamins are absolutely incredible. Back in the day I use to wear a wave cap as well as a baseball cap on top of it and due to my scalp not receiving fresh air along with clogging my hair follicles with wave grease it did a number on my hair. What I did not understand was the importance of nutrients for great hair health. Beanstalk has been totally amazing for revitalizing new hair growth. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It has worked wonders on my nails.  However, I do not see hair growth, but there is no more falling out on my comb</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about two months and I&#x27;ve notice my hair is much stronger and shinier.  I definitely will use it again.</li>
    <li> absolutely love it and I saw a difference in hair growth in less than 2 weeks</li>
    <li> OMG I am in Love with Beanstalk Vitamins&lt;br /&gt;This product is the OMG... good! When I saw my roots growing out after about 3 weeks I did a double take. I finished the bottle and started on the 2nd bottle I have maybe 1 week left and I have a inch or so of growth! It is crazy, because I just dyed my hair with blonde highlights and my stylist was going crazy. I showed her the bottle and she mentioned you guys were at Bronner Brothers Hair Show last weekend. This product works expect to see results in 3 weeks. I had no problems with my skin and my nails are growing faster too. I will be purchasing again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> My hair has just started to thin in last year and was desperate for anything to help.  This had some good reviews but didn&#x27;t  do anything for me.  If it takes more than 2 months to work, it should sell in bottles that last that long...not going to reorder to keep trying as feel 2 months should show some effect.</li>
    <li> ive been taking this going on second week.....dont know yet if it does what it is supposed to....giving it more time.....</li>
    <li> So far, it may actually be working, yet too early to tell how much!  Received immediately, though, and am willing to &#x27;stay the course&#x27; in order to give it a fair and reasonable trial!</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 bottles of BeanStalk vitamins here in Georgia two months and my girlfriend&#x27;s hair is growing and smells great... not sure if that is due to the vitamins or not, but... anyway she loves them. She did experience a minor breakout the second week but now her skin and nails look good. So I guess it was an adjustment phase to the vitamins. She will be writing a review soon once she hits her 90 day mark with before and after shots on instagram.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive a quick response regarding this line of products. Planning to use this for my 5 year old daughter diagnosed with alopecia areata. Will keep you posted on results.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s hair was falling out by the brush full every time she brushed her hair. It no longer does that and it is growing at an incredible rate. She doesn&#x27;t take two a day like the bottle says, but obviousally she doesn&#x27;t need to. Taking it once a day has solved the problem. She now wears her hair in a braid because it has gotten so long she sits on it now. She loves this product and will definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> YUCK !!! Do not buy these. I cant say enough how awful they taste. and the after math of them either isnt good. Nothing works from these. I have been taking them for months now, an my hair isnt growing i they said it would.</li>
    <li> Started taking this a  month ago, and am noticing my skin, nails and hair are responding well to it.  The bonus is that this does not upset my stomach at all!!</li>
    <li> Will I half a bottle left I have not seen anything yet</li>
    <li> I have not seen a difference in my hair it has only been 2 weeks, but my face has broken out in over 50+ tiny little white heads, just the small you can barely see unless your right up on me, looks like a rash, but still. Total waste of money &amp; of course I bought 2</li>
    <li> I have not tried these vitamins. I don&#x27;t like the price. Since you have to take (2) vitamins per day for them to be effective, and you only get 30 capsules per bottle, that means that you would need to purchase (2) bottles for (1) month (that&#x27;s $50 not including shipping). So for a (3) month supply you would need to purchase (6) bottles ($150). That&#x27;s an awful lot of $$$ for only (3) months. I was about to purchase them based upon the ingredients until I saw that there was only 30 per bottle.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product ,for women with thinning hair ,only two month now my hair is really thicking ,my nail look so health ,natural glow ,so loving it</li>
    <li> I began taking the vitamins on Dec 27 2013. I got my hair braided the very same day so I could keep track of my growth and accurately determine if the vitamins work. Today is Feb 27 2014 and I measure my hair. It has grown over an inch! Again, I got my hair braided on the same day I began these vitamins and my hair has grown over an inch!! It&#x27;s has only been 2 months! I will continue to take these vitamins and will write another review soon! Great Product !!!!</li>
    <li> This for me was the worse purchase in supplements I have ever made. Prior to taking this Biotin supplement my skin was perfectly clear...no breakouts.  This product created terrible cystic acne on my face, back and chest .  After going online and doing some research, I found that too much Biotin does cause serious cystic acne for a majority of people.  Lots of information online.  Before I ordered it, I did check with my doctor.  She was unaware of any negative side effects with a high dosage.  So I proceeded to take it.  Big mistake!  It has taken me a months to get rid of the acne breakout.  I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.  This was a terrible experience.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Beanstalk hair vitamin for almost one month.  I do believe my hair Is getting stronger.  I will give it another month and at that time I will send an update on the product.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Started using February 1st and really liked how it was gentle on the stomach.I will definitely give this product another go round. Great product. Hoping to get the growth serum as well.</li>
    <li> I didnt see it help. I stopped taking them because they left a nasty taste in my mouth. So I would not try them again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!!! Saw results in a couple weeks...</li>
    <li> My hair is growing, it really works!</li>
    <li> Pretty good Gives a good healthy looking shine  to your hair. An so my hair Looks thicker and fuller.</li>
    <li> I returned the product because the ingredients you advertised on Amazon were not the same amount of msg on the product I received, so I was very dissapointed to say the least.</li>
