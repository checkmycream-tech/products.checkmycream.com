### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The teeth on this are perfectly square.</li>
      <li>Everything good!</li>
      <li>He is happy with them.</li>
      <li>They are well built and a great alternative to an electric shear.  </li>
      <li>This product is a good idea and should have been easy to make.</li>
      <li>It is assembled okay and the motion is fine.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t work great as her fur is so soft.</li>
      <li>The clippers are held together by a wingnut, and really easy to dissassemble/reassemble.</li>
      <li>My electric trimmer has teeth that are tapered to a fine point and goes into the hair like a comb.</li>
      <li>But the comb is fine and the fur won&#x27;t pass into the cutters.  </li>
      <li>really hoped that the claim that they are good for dogs that are nervous about noise was true...</li>
      <li>Should work great for normal hair but for pet grooming, not so much.</li>
      <li>Only good for props or art decoration.</li>
      <li>Shipped very fast.</li>
      <li>I also get a better trim out of them, possibly because of that level of control.</li>
      <li>To begin with, the clip-on attachment (to cut hair at a different height)doesn&#x27;t fit on the clipper, and falls off.  </li>
      <li>If the hair is fine and curled at all then those hairs push down all of the others.</li>
      <li>I was a amazed at first to see absolutely no hairs cut.</li>
      <li>Not due to any fault of the product but of my expectations.</li>
      <li>Not a fully functional item due to the rough and cheap design.</li>
      <li>Too bad, because it&#x27;s a great item to have if there&#x27;s no power.</li>

<li> these clippers did not work at all, this is NOT Amazon&#x27;s fault but the manufacturer of this product  Two thumbs down!!!</li>

<li> Poor quality alloy.</li>
<li> Unfortunately this product bombed for cutting my dogs hair, I wound up using scissors again</li>

    <li> This product is a good idea and should have been easy to make. I wanted it to trim my dog, especially his face. It is assembled okay and the motion is fine. The blade and backing plate however, are not like an electric trimmer. My electric trimmer has teeth that are tapered to a fine point and goes into the hair like a comb. The teeth on this are perfectly square. Fifty percent of the hairs encountered are pushed down. If the hair is fine and curled at all then those hairs push down all of the others. When I tried it on my poodle I was a amazed at first to see absolutely no hairs cut. I soon realized what was happening. If the hairs were short, stiff, and straight, it might cut 50 percent of them, but I found it useless.</li>
    <li> these clippers did not work at all, this is NOT Amazon&#x27;s fault but the manufacturer of this product  Two thumbs down!!! I had to put one star rating, but it&#x27;s not worth even one star</li>
    <li> this thing is rad. works well for beard trimming anywhere. at home if you wanna be eco-friendly or when you&#x27;re out camping...</li>
    <li> It was poorly made and didn&#x27;t work; so I returned it.</li>
    <li> bought for long hair dachshund. Didn&#x27;t work great as her fur is so soft.</li>
    <li> These clippers don&#x27;t clip Yorkie hair at all... booOoOoo.&lt;br /&gt;I really hoped that the claim that they are good for dogs that are nervous about noise was true...&lt;br /&gt;Anyone have any other ideas?&lt;br /&gt;Scizzors seem too dangerous for a dog that jerks around all the time.</li>
    <li> Shipped very fast. Everything good!</li>
    <li> This item arrived as advertised but did not work in the way that I hoped.  Not due to any fault of the product but of my expectations.</li>
    <li> Ya get what ya pay for....</li>
    <li> This is a sturdy, all metal device. Mine came slightly misassembled out of the box. It was pulling hair more than cutting it. Looking at it for a few seconds I could see that the sliding part of the blade was misaligned with the clamp/handle. It took about 30 seconds to fix this. The clippers are held together by a wingnut, and really easy to dissassemble/reassemble. As another reviewer noted, the included attachment does not fit on these clippers. A web search for the same item showed an attachment with clips on either side that would, in theory, make it work. The useless attachment is the only reason I deducted a star.    Once assembled correctly, it cut both my arm hair(fine) and beard(coarse) with ease.</li>
    <li> Was trying to trim up my dogs for the summer, I couldn&#x27;t get it into the fur. It may just be that their hair is too thick. I have had this kind of issue with other fur cutting tools due to the undercoat the dogs have. I think it would work for dogs without thick coats.</li>
    <li> This product turned out to be a waste of money. I get and not run and also was used. not return it because I could. Product not recommended.</li>
    <li> I got fooled by the photo. This is not a fine piece of machinery. Very rough and cheap looking and jams on small thin hair. Only good for props or art decoration. Not a fully functional item due to the rough and cheap design.</li>
    <li> These clippers are just what I need to groom my horse, they look and feel like they are a quality product</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this clipper.  To begin with, the clip-on attachment (to cut hair at a different height)doesn&#x27;t fit on the clipper, and falls off.  Secondly, the clipper itself does not cut hair well and is awkward to use.</li>
    <li> Poor quality alloy. It felt like it would break at any moment. Too bad, because it&#x27;s a great item to have if there&#x27;s no power. But then, there are still the straight-razor and scissors.</li>
    <li> I got these because my electric kept pulling at my beard.  With these, I am in control.  I also get a better trim out of them, possibly because of that level of control.</li>
    <li> Poor construction.  Not the quality of similar clippers I used 50 years ago.</li>
    <li> They are well built and a great alternative to an electric shear.  But I bought it to remove matted fur from my cat who hates the electric clippers.  But the comb is fine and the fur won&#x27;t pass into the cutters.  Should work great for normal hair but for pet grooming, not so much.</li>
    <li> Just like I remember and works even when our electricity doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product bombed for cutting my dogs hair, I wound up using scissors again, I was so hopeful they would work.</li>
    <li> My son has been wanting these for a while and I found them here and got them for him for christmas. He is happy with them.</li>
