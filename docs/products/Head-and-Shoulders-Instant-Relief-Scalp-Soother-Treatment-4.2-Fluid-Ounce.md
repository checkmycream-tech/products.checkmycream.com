### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect for after workouts.</li>
      <li>Then I used the scalp soother on my irritated scalp and it was awesome.</li>
      <li>of us feel that liquid is not the best form for something like this and would have preferred it if it were in a foam form.</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!!!</li>
      <li>This has a very pleasant floral smell but it might be a bit girly for some men.</li>
      <li>and they were great.</li>
      <li>I have been using H&amp;S shampoo and conditioner products for years and they have been great for dandruff control.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that it didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Words can not express how great this product is.</li>
      <li>It always felt great and helped with any irritation from the pool chemicals.  </li>
      <li>For me, this product is a great value at a fraction of my co-pay at the dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
      <li>This scalp soother is alright I guess, but its not that great in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and I know it is a good</li>
      <li>This is a good product for temporary relief itchy scalps.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for about 10 minutes and the itch returns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It applies like a good hand cream, massages in, and then stays there without feeling greasy as I go on with my day.&lt;br /&gt;Products</li>
      <li>Plus, it smells great unlike most of the shampoos.</li>
      <li>And the best relief is when you get it right into your scalp.</li>
      <li>I love the mint and tea tree oil scent!</li>
      <li>so make sure you have a towel nearby so it wont run into your eyes or mouth!</li>
      <li>Applying this product at one of those times produced a pleasant cooling sensation, along with an overpoweringly-minty smell, though I&#x27;m not convinced that the root cause of the itch was treated in any meaningful way.  </li>
      <li>The nice thing is that the itchy feeling stays away for longer.</li>
      <li>Still, it feels nice, and is soothing.</li>
      <li>it’s nice to have this.  </li>
      <li>She liked the peppermint smell and</li>
      <li>It seems like 15 pumps is quite a bit to pump to get that kind of result.</li>
      <li>It produces a nice tingling on the scalp</li>
      <li>There is also a nice tingle from the mint.</li>
      <li>Aromatic smell which I quite liked.  </li>
      <li>I think it smells very nice, very fresh and clean.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and you will feel a very cool sensation!</li>
      <li>It has a fresh scent so ideal for refreshing your scalp.  </li>
      <li>It was very light weight, non greasy and made my head feel cooler.</li>
      <li>I love using Head and Shoulders shampoo, so I thought I would try it.</li>
      <li>I suspect that this Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief product will not be a best seller for Head &amp; Shoulders.  </li>
      <li>I would consider the product to be okay, but nothing more.</li>
      <li>If I did I would for sure use this more often.</li>
      <li>But like most people, I find that my scalp does itch on occasion.  </li>
      <li>(It seems to help the peppermint oil reach your scalp more efficiently.</li>
      <li>you want to make sure you’re getting it where it needs to go.  </li>
      <li>So I suspect this product may be a novelty item that temporarily masks symptoms better treated by a shampoo.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s with morning and bedtime usage, sometimes once or twice more during the day.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this product is just okay.</li>
      <li>It could have been better if not for its short-lived itch relief and lingering peppermint smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had issues with dandruff and itchy scalp for many years, and have had to resort to using tar shampoo after Head &amp; Shoulders wouldn&#x27;t even work.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I would want my scalp to continue to tingle all day!  :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, more of a watery consistency.  </li>
      <li>However most anti-itch hair products are oily and make hair greasy.</li>
      <li>and you get even more itchy.  </li>
      <li>I paid for this product in full with my own money.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Secondly, it has a rather strong, peppermint scent that can linger around for an hour or more.</li>
      <li>I received a free full size bottle of this product from Head and Shoulders and was very satisfied with how well this product worked for me.</li>
      <li>Personally think this product is great, it truly provides instant cooling and great smell that makes me feel good.</li>
      <li>This is one of the best products I have ever used for my dry, itchy scalp!</li>
      <li>It sprays right out of the pump, it is kind of runny</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use,  Just pump the product on your scalp.  </li>
      <li>Does not weigh hair down and smells incredible!</li>
      <li>The cooling and tingling doesn&#x27;t stay last, but while it&#x27;s there, it feels great.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is nice and light which I appreciate, but aside from the nice fragrance, there really is an instant relief.</li>
      <li>: I did NOT receive this product for free or a discount.</li>
      <li>so was happy to try the Instant Relief Scalp Soother Treatment.  </li>
      <li>importantly, this scalp treatment did not relieve any itching.  </li>
      <li>I received this product as well as the Head and Shoulder 2 and 1 shampoo and conditioner and the co-wash conditioner for free to review.  </li>
      <li>But this product delivers on its promises and has an added bonus of smelling fantastic.</li>
      <li>GOOD part is that this product isn&#x27;t oily and it didn&#x27;t make the hair near the scalp stringy or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But for me, I used it as &#x27;spot relief&#x27; because there are spots that seem to get more itchy than others, like right at my forehead hairline and at the side bases of my hairline.</li>
      <li>This is a unique spray that I have never seen before.</li>
      <li>when I saw this product I got excited.</li>
      <li>I was really excited.</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant enough ...</li>
      <li>I ended up blow drying my hair on a cool cycle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap and probably worth a try.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this product has mostly positives and is very affordable.</li>
      <li>It does feel cool on my scalp.  </li>
      <li>This product isn&#x27;t going to break the bank and seems like a good deal that actually works as promised.</li>
      <li>So overall it does work for instant but temporary relief, and seems to work best when combined with a good shampoo / conditioner routine which actually treats your scalp and dandruff issues.</li>
      <li>Once done, I rub it in quickly with my fingers.</li>
      <li>The tingle went away fairly quickly, but you could still feel a cooling sensation on your scalp.</li>
      <li>The scent is minty, mild and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have a mild case of psoriasis of the scalp</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m sure from blow drying with high heat).</li>
      <li>At first, the scent seemed very light and not unpleasant, but I noticed that it really lingered throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>thought it worked fairly well on my overly dry scalp.</li>
      <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure what &amp;#34;Instant Relief Scalp Soother&amp;#34; really meant, but as soon as I started using this product from Head &amp; Shoulders, I got the message right away.</li>
      <li>Thanks to Bzzagent, Head and Shoulders sent me these product for free.</li>
      <li>first thing I noticed was the cool feeling of the product, followed by the minty scent.  </li>
      <li>but honestly it felt similar to just spritzing water on my head without a peppermint smell.</li>
      <li>I saw this product and thought that it was worth a try.</li>
      <li>For $2, I think that it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>The size of this bottle is far more economical compared to Scalpicin and the cooling sensation is so soothing.</li>
      <li>Granted my dandruff issue is pretty mild, but I have not noticed a difference one way or another in using this product.</li>
      <li>I love Head &amp; Shoulders products and really had high hopes for this product.</li>
      <li>It relives it right away</li>
      <li>Right now, I&#x27;ll settle for the benefits I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
      <li>Several hours after applying the scalp treatment, I could very easily smell the mint, which I did not care for.  </li>
      <li>Still, I&#x27;m not sure it was a great idea for our hair (which was also tortured from the chemicals).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a lover of head and shoulders smooth and silky products, so when I was sent the new line and this product to try</li>
      <li>When I was given the chance to try this new Head and Shoulders product, I was excited to give it a spin.  </li>
      <li>course everybody&#x27;s scalp is different, so it might work better for others, it just didn&#x27;t work that well for me.</li>
      <li>I used the shampoo and co wash first</li>

    <li> My husband suffers from an itchy scalp. He uses Head and Shoulders all-in-one, but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t help. He can go days without scratching, but then he&#x27;ll have one day where he almost rips at his skin because it&#x27;s so itchy. I saw this product and thought that it was worth a try. When we used it, it was an add-on product for about $2 so it wasn&#x27;t like you&#x27;re breaking the bank. I have to say that we had a similar experience to others. It gave instant relief but it was not long lasting. In fact, it didn&#x27;t last more than 1-15 minutes. Also, it has a bit of a smell. I know it&#x27;s supposed to be soothing peppermint but I would rather it has no scent at all. If you do decide to use this, here are some tips:&lt;br /&gt;1. Use the Heads and Shoulders shampoo and conditioner&lt;br /&gt;2. Put it on DRY hair&lt;br /&gt;3. Try to part your hair and pump it directly into your scalp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the product on wet hair does just about nothing. And the best relief is when you get it right into your scalp. For $2, I think that it&#x27;s worth it. But it&#x27;s definitely not a cure-all!</li>
    <li> I have been using H&amp;S shampoo and conditioner products for years and they have been great for dandruff control. However, this particular Scalp Soother is the first H&amp;S product that turns out to be not great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, it&#x27;s a topical treatment product, not a conditioner that I initially thought it was. It&#x27;s supposed to be applied directly to a dry scalp for an instant itch relief. You need to pump out 15 times over the scalp at the roots. It&#x27;s easy to use if you have bald or little hair but hard to do if you have thick hair. It is also ineffective if applied to wet hair or towel dried hair after shampooing. While it does provide instant coolness on dry, itchy scalp, it is not long lasting. It&#x27;s good for about 10 minutes and the itch returns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it has a rather strong, peppermint scent that can linger around for an hour or more. If you apply it and then go for a meeting or a location with close proximity to people, they will most likely notice the smell on you. You&#x27;ll smell like you just rubbed in some Tiger Balm. I would rather have a treatment product with no or little smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is just okay. It could have been better if not for its short-lived itch relief and lingering peppermint smell. I probably would not buy it again once it runs out. I think the regular use of the H&amp;S shampoos and conditioners would offer better dandruff and itch control in the long run.</li>
    <li> This is a unique spray that I have never seen before. I love using Head and Shoulders shampoo, so I thought I would try it. My first concern was that it would leave my hair with a greasy look. I&#x27;m happy to say that it didn&#x27;t. It was very light weight, non greasy and made my head feel cooler. This is a different type of product, but one I will continue to use (especially in the summer)!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have ever used for my dry, itchy scalp! Does not weigh hair down and smells incredible! Feels tingly as soon as it goes on without the tar odor of some products.  Gotitfree. Bzzagent</li>
    <li> This is a good product for temporary relief itchy scalps.  It contains peppermint and tea tree oil.  It has a fresh scent so ideal for refreshing your scalp.  There is an initial cooling, tingling sensation that subsides.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for severe or prolonged iirritations.  Perfect for after workouts.</li>
    <li> Aromatic smell which I quite liked.  I have a mild case of psoriasis of the scalp but I also run into occasional references to head lice, the mere mention of which makes my head itch. (I&#x27;m getting a bit itchy even typing this.) Once I thoughtlessly scratch my scalp though the itching gets worse. Using this as directed seems to break this rather annoying cycle. A bottle of this is in a drawer at my desk at work.</li>
    <li> My son has always had an itchy scalp. Since he was a toddler he&#x27;s had dandruff. He has to use an anti-dandruff shampoo regularly to keep his hair to a level of just having mild-dandruff issues. So there are times he complains about his head being itchy and asks for something for it. However most anti-itch hair products are oily and make hair greasy. The problem tends to be once he starts itching a lot, it won&#x27;t stop. Like a mosquito bite. Once you start scratching it aggravates the skin and you get even more itchy.  I had him try this and the first thing I noticed is it isn&#x27;t like other anti-itch topical solutions in that it&#x27;s not oily. It does relieve his scalp long enough for him to stop itching, thus his skin calms down and helps him stop scratching. He loves this stuff and how it helps, and I like that he can use it and it not make his hair look like he hasn&#x27;t showered in days.</li>
    <li> Yes this cools your scalp, yes it smells like peppermint but honestly it felt similar to just spritzing water on my head without a peppermint smell. I won&#x27;t be buying this again, it works but a water spray bottle for me gas the same results minus the scent.</li>
    <li> I have mild dandruff, so I typically use anti-dandruff shampoo. Sometimes I get an itchy scalp, too. I have tried this product on my scalp when it feels particularly itchy, and it does seem to really do a decent job of soothing my itchy skin. I don&#x27;t think it is the sort of product I would typically spend the money on, as I wouldn&#x27;t say my scalp is often needing this sort of product, and I would just as soon spend the money on other things. still, it DOES work like it is supposed to and that is the main basis for my four-star review.</li>
    <li> I received a free full size bottle of this product from Head and Shoulders and was very satisfied with how well this product worked for me. I have never tried a product like this that specifically treats scalp discomfort, I really didn&#x27;t even know they existed! But this product delivers on its promises and has an added bonus of smelling fantastic. I would recommend this to anyone that struggles with severe scalp irritation as a handy instant relief between showers and anyone that has small spots of dryness/itchiness and not all over discomfort since this can be applied directly and pretty precisely wherever needed. Personally think this product is great, it truly provides instant cooling and great smell that makes me feel good.</li>
    <li> This reminds me of John Frieda volumnizer in terms of packaging. Like Frieda, it is applied to the root/scalp area. However, the trick is to work the product through the hair. I ended up blow drying my hair on a cool cycle.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it worked fairly well on my overly dry scalp. No dandruff there, but the scalp was feeling drier than normal. I believe the tea tree oil helped supply a tingly sensation that made my scalp feel good as well as less dry. I have used this for a few days now and must admit like the overall sensation as well as the cost. This product isn&#x27;t going to break the bank and seems like a good deal that actually works as promised.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell if H &amp; S Instant Relief has much of a long term effect on the scalp, but it does have a lovely fragrance, and is a treat to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been a horrible early spring for my sinuses, and I LOVE the peppermint effect of this product.  I&#x27;ve been suffering a sinus headache for several days, and this stuff actually helped.  It&#x27;s invigorating and just made me feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been reading about the benefits of Tea Tree oil as well, and think maybe this product needs to be used regularly for a while to see lasting scalp improvement.  Right now, I&#x27;ll settle for the benefits I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
    <li> I sometimes get dry, itchy skin on my scalp during the colder months of the year.  I had hoped Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief would help stop the sporadic itching.  The directions say to apply to your entire scalp right at the skin, which I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was the cool feeling of the product, followed by the minty scent.  At first, the scent seemed very light and not unpleasant, but I noticed that it really lingered throughout the day.  Several hours after applying the scalp treatment, I could very easily smell the mint, which I did not care for.  I don&#x27;t really want to smell like mint all day; it isn&#x27;t something I really like and it doesn&#x27;t at all complement the perfume or other scented products I enjoy using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, this scalp treatment did not relieve any itching.  Even though I could feel the cooling effects of the product for quite some time, at no point did it relieve the itching.  I ended up taking a second shower to shampoo my hair with a Neutrogena anti-dandruff and itch relief shampoo to both help my skin and to finally be rid of the minty odor.</li>
    <li> The directions say you can apply this anytime to your hair.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if you just washed it (and towel dried it) or if it&#x27;s been dry for a long time.  However, the directions also say to apply 15 pumps to your scalp.  15 pumps is a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has used this several times and said that it helped with itchiness, but he really dislikes the smell.  Running hands through hair with this product already in it will leave your hands smelling like the product, even hours later.  It doesn&#x27;t make the hair greasy, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using it, but have long, thick hair and it was difficult to get the liquid only on my scalp so I gave up on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of us feel that liquid is not the best form for something like this and would have preferred it if it were in a foam form.</li>
    <li> This product will give you a cooling sensation that will give your itchy scalp relief.  It does what it says it will do.  If your scalp is driving you nuts give this a try.  It doesn&#x27;t make it stop itching completely but it definitely soothes and cools it and you will feel relief.</li>
    <li> All my life I have struggled with dandruff and itchy scalp. Remember the scene from The Breakfast Club where Allison ruffles her hair and it starts snowing? Yeah, that&#x27;s me without Head &amp; Shoulders. Usually just the shampoo is enough, but sometimes I have these flareups that get really itchy and will stay itchy for days or weeks on end. That&#x27;s where this product comes in. It helps stop the itch and soothe the scalp. It is a real blessing having discovered this product. I wish I&#x27;d had this stuff 25 years ago!</li>
    <li> I have been having problems with my scalp itching all the time.  I went to the dermatologist and I have received all kinds of oils and liquids for this problem and they did not work.  After a couple of sprays the tingling soothe my itchy scalp.  I had suffered for a long time and I have tried countless remedies.  I received this product as well as the Head and Shoulder 2 and 1 shampoo and conditioner and the co-wash conditioner for free to review.  I must say my itching has improved dramatically.  My daughter was complaining about her hair itching and I used it on her also.  She liked the peppermint smell and the way it made her scalp feel.  I will definitely repurchase this product because it has worked for me. The only thing about this product is it is a liquid so if you flat iron and use this your roots will go back to their original texture.</li>
    <li> Words can not express how great this product is. It really leaves your scalp feeling refreshed! This is not to be confused with a leave- in conditioner. Sure you can use it right after you wash and condition your hair but also you can spray it in your hair anytime you want, especially if it feels dry or itchy. It relives it right away and you will feel a very cool sensation! It sprays right out of the pump, it is kind of runny so make sure you have a towel nearby so it wont run into your eyes or mouth! I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I really like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It does feel cool on my scalp.  I squirt it on and massage it in and my scalp feels tingly and cooler.  The cooling and tingling doesn&#x27;t stay last, but while it&#x27;s there, it feels great.  I don&#x27;t think I would want my scalp to continue to tingle all day!  :)&lt;br /&gt;- It really does take away the itch for me.  And it looks like using it continually over time has made one especially itchy area much better and less itchy.  I&#x27;m finding I am using less of the product the longer I use it.&lt;br /&gt;- I think it smells very nice, very fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s easy to use,  Just pump the product on your scalp.  It&#x27;s not greasy, more of a watery consistency.  It does get the hair wet at the scalp area, but it dries soft and without looking weird.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with dandruff and itchy scalp for many years, and have had to resort to using tar shampoo after Head &amp; Shoulders wouldn&#x27;t even work. I&#x27;ve found that using this instant relief scalp spray after washing my hair with the tar shampoo does help to elevate the level of overall effectiveness and itch relief. It produces a nice tingling on the scalp and I have no itching afterwards for at least an hour or two. It doesn&#x27;t last &amp;#34;all day&amp;#34; or anything close, and you have to use 10-20 sprays of the stuff (your experience will vary depending on scalp issues and amount of hair). So overall it does work for instant but temporary relief, and seems to work best when combined with a good shampoo / conditioner routine which actually treats your scalp and dandruff issues. This product doesn&#x27;t treat the issues, just helps to temporarily soothe them. As long as you keep those points in mind, this might be worth a try.</li>
    <li> I suspect that this Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief product will not be a best seller for Head &amp; Shoulders.  I have nothing against it, but it is not very great.  Over the past several days, I have applied the non-stinky smelling product to my scalp, less than the 15 recommended pumps because my hair is short and thin, and for a brief moment, I experienced a coolness.  Unfortunately, it was short-lived, even with a nice scalp massage.  I had no residual small or product on my hair, so I would consider the product to be okay, but nothing more.</li>
    <li> First.  I have itchy scalp and I&#x27;m not sure why. I have allergies and I have dry skin (because I am old) so I&#x27;m not sure which could be involved here.  But because I&#x27;ve no idea what is the culprit I&#x27;m giving this product 3-Stars, because it might help someone else... but it did nothing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No relief.  I have long hair and I maneuvered my hair out of the way and sprayed as instructed. I briefly felt the minty-ness and then nothing. And when I say &#x27;briefly&#x27; I mean less than a minute. Maybe 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GOOD part is that this product isn&#x27;t oily and it didn&#x27;t make the hair near the scalp stringy or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really going to stick with this product until the bottle is empty but after a week I&#x27;m not expecting anything miraculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meh. It&#x27;s cheap and probably worth a try.</li>
    <li> Let’s begin by saying I don’t use this product precisely the same way as some other people might, but I think still within the way the product is marketed. Let me explain. I live in a dry climate so naturally my scalp will be dry, and may sometimes itch slightly. But I don’t have dandruff or psoriasis. Under normal conditions I shampoo daily in a shower and don’t have to use a shampoo like Head &amp; Shoulders, although I have used their shampoo and I know it is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are times when I can’t shampoo daily, like when traveling or camping or maybe just staying overnight with a friend. There are specialized “dry” shampoos designed for such occasions but they are just that … dry and not the best thing to use when the weather is hot and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I saw this product I got excited. It is intended to “invigorates scalp for instant cooling relief on-the-go, can be used anytime, anywhere”. Sounds perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it met my expectations. It applies like a good hand cream, massages in, and then stays there without feeling greasy as I go on with my day.&lt;br /&gt;Products like this, especially from a big name company, are usually quite expensive. One of the reasons I rated this highly was because of the surprisingly low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only sticking point for me was the manufacturer’s suggestion to “apply 15 pumps directly to scalp using the nozzle applicator”.  15 pumps????? That’s a lot unless you have hair like Lady Godiva. I’m more comfortable with about half that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product has mostly positives and is very affordable.</li>
    <li> If you have “scalp irritation” of any sort, you might want to give this a try.  Especially for the cost, it’s a lot less than a visit to the dermatologist!  Hahahahaha  If you have long hair, you’ll want to part-and-spray. . . part-and-spray. . . . part-and-spray. . . repeat, as this is for your scalp and not your hair you want to make sure you’re getting it where it needs to go.  I have “mild irritation” sometimes and not true “itchy scalp”, so it’s nice to have this.  I already use the “regular” Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo, and have for years.  The next time I need to buy shampoo, I’m going to give the Instant Relieve 2-in-1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner a try as well.</li>
    <li> I suffer from seborrheic dermatitis, so itchy scalp is a daily thing for me. I&#x27;ve relied on Scalpicin for the past couple years, but it wasn&#x27;t cutting the stubborn itchiness anymore. The size of this bottle is far more economical compared to Scalpicin and the cooling sensation is so soothing. This has a very pleasant floral smell but it might be a bit girly for some men. It&#x27;s true that the cooling effect doesn&#x27;t last long, but I&#x27;ve yet to come across something that lasts longer than 30 minutes for me. The instructions say you can use this with towel dried or dry hair, but it works far better if your scalp and hair are wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair so I definitely separate my hair into section and apply this generously. Once done, I rub it in quickly with my fingers. To further help this stuff penetrate your scalp brush your hair while it is still damp (if you are one of the people than can brush your hair while it is wet (It seems to help the peppermint oil reach your scalp more efficiently. This product is a staple for me although I do wish the sensation lasted a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I did NOT receive this product for free or a discount. I paid for this product in full with my own money.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!!! I didn&#x27;t expect a product to work as well as it is advertised but IT DOES. I used the shampoo and co wash first and they were great. Then I used the scalp soother on my irritated scalp and it was awesome. Thanks to Bzzagent, Head and Shoulders sent me these product for free. I am so grateful for this campaign because I am now a faithful customer of Head and Shoulders products.</li>
    <li> Years ago, my swimming friends and I used to soak cotton balls in Sea Breeze and slowly squeeze them over our tortured scalps. It always felt great and helped with any irritation from the pool chemicals.  Still, I&#x27;m not sure it was a great idea for our hair (which was also tortured from the chemicals). When I was given the chance to try this new Head and Shoulders product, I was excited to give it a spin.  Now, I like the locking mechanism on the bottle. (It&#x27;s a small plastic collar that prevents the top from compressing and ruining everything in one&#x27;s gym bag). And, the application process is pretty clever. (The long neck allows one to apply this close to one&#x27;s scalp). Now, for me, the product was a little too runny. After three pumps in various areas, I tipped my head down to grab my toothpaste and the product ran down my forehead. Likewise, I could feel it slow dripping down my scalp ... this was both an ichy and tickle-y sensation that lead me to actually scratching my scalp. Maybe if I used less it wouldn&#x27;t run? Next time, I will try to massage it in-place a bit better?  The smell is pleasant enough ... no complaints here.  The price is inexpensive enough that anyone who might benefit from this should at least try it.</li>
    <li> I never really had bad dandruff, but now that I keep my hair buzzed, my scalp gets itchy, especially in the winter when I where my hats (some wool, some polar fleece, some cotton). I do not get a rash, but I get some splotchy areas and they itch. Because it happens with different materials, I do not think it is allergic in nature. I used Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief Scalp Soother and my head started to tingle. Probably from the menthol. That feeling lasts for several minutes. It seems like 15 pumps is quite a bit to pump to get that kind of result. Still, it feels nice, and is soothing. The nice thing is that the itchy feeling stays away for longer. It is always a little disconcerting reading a warning that something you are applying to your head is flammable, but I guess it is the alcohol. I&#x27;m not worried, as I don&#x27;t plan on applying this while I bbq. Shower, shampoo, condition, towel dry and apply.</li>
    <li> I get dry scalp towards the front of my head (I&#x27;m sure from blow drying with high heat). I love Head &amp; Shoulders products and really had high hopes for this product. I expected it to provide soothing relief and being made by Head &amp; Shoulders, I also expected it to help with dandruff. Two birds, one stone. Unfortunately for me this product only hit one bird. Upon applying the product I did experience a cooling relief, but it only lasted about 15 minutes. Granted my dandruff issue is pretty mild, but I have not noticed a difference one way or another in using this product. If what you&#x27;re looking for is short-term relief, this may be the product for you. Just don&#x27;t expect this one to do it all. It&#x27;s an alright product for short term relief but nothing more, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> It seems to achieve the basic aim, which is to reduce itching. The scent is stronger than I would like, it can be tough to get it on your scalp instead of losing a lot into your hair, and the effect is (obviously) temporary. It&#x27;s not a bad thing to try for mild but nagging problems, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s something I&#x27;d want to be relying on as a regular thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a lover of head and shoulders smooth and silky products, so when I was sent the new line and this product to try I was really excited. The peppermint tingle is really nice after you wash your, especially on the days when your scalp is extra itchy. The tingle went away fairly quickly, but you could still feel a cooling sensation on your scalp. I like this product and would recommend it for those who can wash their often. I&#x27;m bi-racial and have course/dry hair, so I don&#x27;t wash or even get my hair wet more then once a week. If I did I would for sure use this more often. For now I&#x27;m using after I do my wash routine and I really like it. My husband even tried it on his bald head!</li>
    <li> My scalp gets really itchy sometimes, usually because of chlorine in my water... I have been using a flake relief shampoo, but my scalp is still itchy. This really helps to soothe my scalp, and relieve the itch! Plus, it smells great unlike most of the shampoos. I love the mint and tea tree oil scent! Plus, I&#x27;ve read that tea tree oil really helps to to make your roots healthier!</li>
    <li> I received this recently and just started using. At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure what &amp;#34;Instant Relief Scalp Soother&amp;#34; really meant, but as soon as I started using this product from Head &amp; Shoulders, I got the message right away. I didn&#x27;t use the directed of 15 pumps, because I thought that was a bit much but I can see why they instruct that. But for me, I used it as &#x27;spot relief&#x27; because there are spots that seem to get more itchy than others, like right at my forehead hairline and at the side bases of my hairline. The fragrance is nice and light which I appreciate, but aside from the nice fragrance, there really is an instant relief. I don&#x27;t like to wash my hair everyday as I did when I was younger, but by that third day, it does get itchy so this worked nicely. There is also a nice tingle from the mint. Not sure if this will be a staple of my cabinet, but I&#x27;m definitely going to give it some thought.</li>
    <li> My husband has issues with both dandruff and occasional itchy scalp.  He loves H&amp;S shampoos to control the former so was happy to try the Instant Relief Scalp Soother Treatment.  Unfortunately, he tells me that while it certainly produced a cool feeling to his scalp when he first sprayed it on, it only last a few minutes and the itchiness came right back.  He doesn&#x27;t think it feasible to carry the spray around and spray his scalp every ten minutes for the amount of relief that he gets, so the product doesn&#x27;t work well enough for him to continue using it.  It may work differently for others and as it did work for a short amount of time, I think it is rated average - hopefully it will work better for someone else.</li>
    <li> I contend with extreme winter \\&quot;dandruff\\&quot; and dry scalp that may or may not be part of my general susceptibility to eczema and skin allergies.  I&#x27;ve done pretty well with Head and Shoulder&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner to fend off the itch until this year.  Even H&amp;S&#x27;s special anti-itch formula has fallen short this season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spraying the scalp soother as directed, I get an instant sense of relief that might not be much different than if I sprayed the area with Bactine.  Lidocaine is the anesthetic that&#x27;s used in the Bactine product; reading the H&amp;S Scalp Soother&#x27;s ingredients, I can&#x27;t readily identify what&#x27;s working as an analgesic here, but this product does contain Niacinamide, a derivative of niacin, which has anti-inflammatory properties.  Various medical websites state that Niacinamide may also help with other inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis and rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tonic also contains Pantenolol, which the Google tells me is used in various personal care products to treat skin irritations such as mild burns, sunburns, cuts, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the above, there are additives from the silicone/dimethicone category and moisturizers, along with alchohol and mentha (mint).  The scent is minty, mild and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether this works for you over the longer haul (after the immediate-but-temporary relief) might, I guess, have a lot to do with the source of your scalp irritation.  For me, I&#x27;m finding that the irritated areas of my scalp are healing slowly but surely, and I&#x27;m not as often irritated to the point of scratching, something you obviously need to avoid, to heal!  That&#x27;s with morning and bedtime usage, sometimes once or twice more during the day.  For me, this product is a great value at a fraction of my co-pay at the dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that I have an uncomfortably itchy scalp, so I&#x27;m probably not ideally-suited to review this product.  But like most people, I find that my scalp does itch on occasion.  Applying this product at one of those times produced a pleasant cooling sensation, along with an overpoweringly-minty smell, though I&#x27;m not convinced that the root cause of the itch was treated in any meaningful way.  So I suspect this product may be a novelty item that temporarily masks symptoms better treated by a shampoo.</li>
    <li> This scalp soother is alright I guess, but its not that great in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I used the recommended amount to sprays, which is 15.&lt;br /&gt;The soothe is very brief, and that&#x27;s about it, after a brief while (less than an hour), my itchiness returned.&lt;br /&gt;Of course everybody&#x27;s scalp is different, so it might work better for others, it just didn&#x27;t work that well for me.</li>
</ol>
