      <li>LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I find that if you want to re-slick it, DO NOT ADD MORE PRODUCT!</li>
      <li>To each their own</li>
      <li>Keeps it shiny all day, albeit sort of greasy, and stays the way I want it to but is very easy through out the day to comb through and change or fix.</li>
      <li>It is a little too greasy for my liking, but has great shine and a wonderful scent.</li>
      <li>I love this pomade.  </li>
      <li>All in all, I LOVE the smell and the manageability it provides.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t provide any hold for my thick/coarse hair; might be ok for thin/soft hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is kind of light, but thicker than most.</li>
      <li>Tigi BedHead products and Dirt Texturizing Paste by Jonathan are 2 better products to try.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>There have been times I used more than that</li>
      <li>Axe is way more better.</li>
      <li>My favorite hair product.  </li>
      <li>I almost opted for the glue by this company but glad I went with this one.</li>
      <li>top of that</li>
      <li>my favorite hair product no greasy look</li>
      <li>the other brands and to work the best for me.</li>
      <li>and it will look good as new!</li>
      <li>When this stuff first goes on, it seems to work just fine.  </li>
      <li>Quickly went in the trash.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyways, this product is decent at the most.</li>
      <li>The texture is very malleable, however, and is easily scooped out with a fingertip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent is strong, for sure, but definitely one I like.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t hold my hair in place at all and left it feeling kind of greasy.</li>
      <li>I got this on sale from cvs for $3.99 so tought it was worth a shot.</li>
      <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, the label says got2be</li>
      <li>This product does not make your hair stiff or shiny while still offering a great hold throughout the day</li>
      <li>The price is right.</li>
      <li>Also has a very strong orange candy-like smell that I think would only appeal to teenyboppers.</li>
      <li>I wanted my hair to look pretty and slick without using harmful chemicals like a relaxer to straighten it and this worked pretty good!</li>
      <li>I rated it 4 stars only because I would of liked to get it a BIT more slicker but overall, for $3.99, it&#x27;ll do!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Looks</li>
      <li>and I LOVED how slick and pretty it made it!</li>
      <li>That will be the first thing everyone notices about you.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do what it says!  </li>
      <li>You will look exactly like the ringmaster from the Absinthe show in Las Vegas.  </li>
      <li>good for a few hrs</li>
      <li>I would suggest to use the product sparingly until you have the right look, until you know how much you need&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works best for tapered short styles if you want them to be slick straight, like I wanted.</li>
      <li>With the defiant pomade my hair has a great shine to it, a little greasy, and it looks better and softer than the gel I had been using previously.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve always received positive feedback</li>
      <li>but the product was always the same, creamy and easy to spread through hair</li>
      <li>I use several go2b glued products and this is one I can&#x27;t live without. :)</li>
      <li>The product will get greasy/heavy if you use to much.</li>
      <li>I have straight hair, but in the humidity or after blow drying it gets a bit frizzy.  </li>
      <li>Works very well, to hold style, and provide shine.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;You have to really rub it in your hands before applying it to your hair.</li>
      <li>I bought it for like $9 in store, so its really a bargain online.</li>
      <li>Very Poor&lt;br</li>
      <li>for straight hair.</li>
      <li>If I&#x27;m going for the smooth, sleek, &amp;#34;ivy league&amp;#34; part, I use this with just a touch of Royal Crown Hairdressing for extra shine.  </li>
      <li>But that really depends on where you are and what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
      <li>Very embarrassed.</li>
      <li>my memory, the hold on this product was decent.</li>
      <li>The air was very dry, and had light breeze every now and then.</li>
      <li>It looked more like dried gel then pomade.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s a soft hold and no flakes!</li>
      <li>My old gel got discontinued</li>
      <li>and I happened to be near a bathroom, I could dampen my hair with some water, and then the formula kept my hair in place and perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is not for spiking, ir is for a soft bounce</li>
      <li>used to mainly lift the hair near my forehead only, and then apply some Got2B to my comb and comb the rest in.</li>
      <li>made it greasy feeling, but I have found that it can be beneficial when it is raining or humid out as I only use this product when my hair is straight (naturally curly) and extra product keeps it from going frizzy.</li>
      <li>only complaint is that since, like with all pomades, you need to use it sparingly, sometimes I don&#x27;t use enough and after it sets in (after an hour or two) I need to put more in (which sometimes sucks if I&#x27;m out and don&#x27;t have the product in hand), but this is more of a \\&quot;user error\\&quot; than a con with the product, just like making your hair greasy from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>you are sensitive to smells, I would suggest going to the local pharmacy/beauty supply store and smelling the product before purchasing it online.</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t need a pomade contributing so much to my odor signature that people can smell me down the street.</li>

<li> I just don&#x27;t need a pomade contributing so much to my odor signature that people can smell me down the street.</li>
<li> I am a natural haired black female and I just got the left side of my hair cut low to a tapered fade style!</li>
<li> But as the day wears on, you will go from styled and shiny to flat and greasy.  </li>
<li> I tie a scarf around my head to and in the morning it was still pretty slick!</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t define or shine hair, just made it greasy and flat!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll just mix it with water to give it a slick wet and straight look!</li>
<li> So far I have tried Got 2b Defiant, and a few of the other white pomades by the same company.</li>
<li> Bought this product long ago, like maybe 5 years ago from a retail store.</li>
<li> It does have a strong perfume smell, however, it&#x27;s far from a bad smell, and I always receive compliments on the smell.</li>
<li> As for the smell, I never noticed it and given you only use a tiny amount (less than a 1/2 tsp is about what I use)</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t matter if I apply to wet hair after showering or with dry hair, my hair pops up shortly after applying and re-combing does</li>
<li> I have Indian hair, but it cowlicks a lot when my hair turns dry.</li>
<li> but it tended to get dry or make my hair stick one way and not move at all.</li>
<li> But you have to let it air dry for it to stay neat.</li>
<li> My hair otherwise looks dry and mousy.  </li>
<li> You only need a small amount, so the container will last a while.</li>
<li> The POMADE was hard rather than soft like a cream.</li>
<li> Simply spray some water on it, jus a little, and comb or brush down</li>
<li> Just a little goes a long way!</li>
<li> If I&#x27;m going for the messy look, I mix it equally with a wax or paste to add a little shine plus boost the scent.  </li>
<li> This product makes my dry, bleached hair shimmer!!!</li>
<li> was looking for pomade to slick my hair down flat, no height,</li>
<li> But I did like that if it started coming down</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The POMADE was hard rather than soft like a cream. &lt;br /&gt;You have to really rub it in your hands before applying it to your hair. &lt;br /&gt;Gives hair a good shine. Texturizing isn&#x27;t that great with this product. &lt;br /&gt;Best for straight hair.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Tough hold without flaking.</li>
    <li> So far I have tried Got 2b Defiant, and a few of the other white pomades by the same company. I have also tried Fat hair, and Gillette sculpting pomade. Some of this stuff can get a little pricey, I have found the got 2b brand to be usually a few dollars lower then the other brands and to work the best for me. I used to use gel but it tended to get dry or make my hair stick one way and not move at all. With the defiant pomade my hair has a great shine to it, a little greasy, and it looks better and softer than the gel I had been using previously. The white kinds of pomade paste from got 2b, Gillette, and fat hair all were not my cup of tea. They each made my hair very hard and not shiny at all. It looked more like dried gel then pomade. This defiant stuff is the best. Keeps it shiny all day, albeit sort of greasy, and stays the way I want it to but is very easy through out the day to comb through and change or fix. Cheaper than the rest, especially on Ebay. This is the best stuff out there.</li>
    <li> was melted when arrived  had to throw away</li>
    <li> To summarize, the smell lasts longer than the hold, it dries out my hands, and I will be throwing away my tub without finishing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this up on a whim at a grocery store. It doesn&#x27;t do anything right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like really firm orange jello. It has a translucent, bright orange color and wiggles like jello when I flick the tub. The texture is very malleable, however, and is easily scooped out with a fingertip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like orange dish soap. When I open the container I get blasted with a chemical-like citrus odor, like I was huffing a bottle of dish soap. The smell does NOT go away after time. I could smell my own  hair 24 hours (and a good night&#x27;s sleep) after applying. For what it&#x27;s worth, the label says got2be is a Dial company, and Dial also makes dish soap. Maybe they use leftover ingredients to make this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for pomade to slick my hair down flat, no height, no styling, no pomp. This does that poorly. It doesn&#x27;t matter if I apply to wet hair after showering or with dry hair, my hair pops up shortly after applying and re-combing does nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To add insult to injury, it makes my palms chalk up and become itchy.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s separates hair, adds shine and deepens color. My hair otherwise looks dry and mousy.  I use several go2b glued products and this is one I can&#x27;t live without. :)</li>
    <li> This is not a bad pomade, by my hair reeked so bad of a bad perfumey smell that it gave me a headache, and I chucked out a nearly-new jar. Seriously, the smell is so bad it makes AXE seem tame by comparison, and the AXE pomade I have left has way too strong an odor/perfume for me too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking about switching to something created in 1926....Murray&#x27;s. I just don&#x27;t need a pomade contributing so much to my odor signature that people can smell me down the street. Seriously. Smell before buying, especially if you&#x27;re a male and don&#x27;t want to smell like a grandmother all gussied up for full-contact Bingo.</li>
    <li> 1) Hold Strength &#x3D; Very Poor&lt;br /&gt;2) Hair Texture &#x3D; Poor&lt;br /&gt;2) Smell &#x3D; Fair&lt;br /&gt;3) Price &#x3D; Fair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed overall in this product. Didn&#x27;t hold my hair in place at all and left it feeling kind of greasy. The smell reminds me of citrus if you are into that.</li>
    <li> I love this pomade.  I have straight hair, but in the humidity or after blow drying it gets a bit frizzy.  Pomade takes care of that.  As for the smell, I never noticed it and given you only use a tiny amount (less than a 1/2 tsp is about what I use) i don&#x27;t know how you would even smell it.  It&#x27;s the best and cheapest pomade I have found.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair product.  Couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores.  Love it!</li>
    <li> If you want dull and dirty looking hair, then this product is for you. If dull and dirty is not the look you&#x27;re going for, seek elsewhere. Tigi BedHead products and Dirt Texturizing Paste by Jonathan are 2 better products to try.  [[ASIN:B0009I4MDE TIGI BedHead Hard To Get Paste 1.5 Ounces]]  [[ASIN:B000O2PDRO Jonathan Hair Care Jonathan DIRT Texturizing Paste]]</li>
    <li> my favorite hair product no greasy look</li>
    <li> It is a little too greasy for my liking, but has great shine and a wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> I like it. My old gel got discontinued so now I use this. It does smell like Oranges, but that wears off after 30-min and the hold+shine lasts all day. The price is right.</li>
    <li> just a dab controls your hair and makes it smell sooo good! This is not for spiking, ir is for a soft bounce</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! Just a little goes a long way! This product makes my dry, bleached hair shimmer!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this product long ago, like maybe 5 years ago from a retail store. I bought it for like $9 in store, so its really a bargain online. Also I bought it when they still used a bright teal colored packaging.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, this product is decent at the most. For a pomade, this was a very different texture. It was like soap-like cream. It was transparent and had a smell that almost resembled glue. Unfortunately I&#x27;ve had this product for too long, and kept it in my bathroom&#x27;s drawer. Today when I pulled it out, the inside had melted to a fully transparent goo. It smells horrible now, but it was half decent before. Got2b Defiant, never had a good smell. It was always a &amp;#34;whatever&amp;#34; smell.&lt;br /&gt;From my memory, the hold on this product was decent. I noticed it took a lot to get any hold. My hair is kind of light, but thicker than most. I have Indian hair, but it cowlicks a lot when my hair turns dry. This product was good at making my hair look fluent, it kept it all together. It also adds a small shine to your head. Looks good.&lt;br /&gt;The hold though, diminishes after maybe 2-4 hours after being applied. But that really depends on where you are and what you&#x27;re doing. For example, I bought this in midst of Winter back in 2008-09. The air was very dry, and had light breeze every now and then. Got2b, kept my hair together if a gush of wind came by, but over a time period, the product itself dries up and looses its  hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to mainly lift the hair near my forehead only, and then apply some Got2B to my comb and comb the rest in. It held alright. Wasn&#x27;t the biggest fan of it. But I did like that if it started coming down and I happened to be near a bathroom, I could dampen my hair with some water, and then the formula kept my hair in place and perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something with medium hold and can be used to manipulate your hair throughout the day, then this is for you.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day.  The scent is strong, for sure, but definitely one I like.  If I&#x27;m going for the smooth, sleek, &amp;#34;ivy league&amp;#34; part, I use this with just a touch of Royal Crown Hairdressing for extra shine.  If I&#x27;m going for the messy look, I mix it equally with a wax or paste to add a little shine plus boost the scent.  All in all, I LOVE the smell and the manageability it provides.  The only thing that prevents it from five stars is the fact that despite using it every day, I can&#x27;t use it as a stand-alone product for my purposes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now. It does have a strong perfume smell, however, it&#x27;s far from a bad smell, and I always receive compliments on the smell. The product will get greasy/heavy if you use to much. My hair is rather short, so I section it off and use a pea size in the front, middle, then back. There have been times I used more than that and it weighed my hair down/made it greasy feeling, but I have found that it can be beneficial when it is raining or humid out as I only use this product when my hair is straight (naturally curly) and extra product keeps it from going frizzy. I would suggest to use the product sparingly until you have the right look, until you know how much you need&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is creamy. I noticed another reviewer said it was hard, maybe it was old/sat on the shelf too long. In the years I&#x27;ve used this product it has never been hard. They did change the packaging once and that threw me in a loop but the product was always the same, creamy and easy to spread through hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that since, like with all pomades, you need to use it sparingly, sometimes I don&#x27;t use enough and after it sets in (after an hour or two) I need to put more in (which sometimes sucks if I&#x27;m out and don&#x27;t have the product in hand), but this is more of a \\&quot;user error\\&quot; than a con with the product, just like making your hair greasy from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are sensitive to smells, I would suggest going to the local pharmacy/beauty supply store and smelling the product before purchasing it online. To each their own but I&#x27;ve always received positive feedback</li>
    <li> Smells terrible totaaly grossed every one around me out. Very embarrassed. Axe is way more better. Definitely will not recommend.</li>
    <li> Works very well, to hold style, and provide shine. You only need a small amount, so the container will last a while.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and will never give it up. Please do not stop making it!!!</li>
    <li> When this stuff first goes on, it seems to work just fine.  But as the day wears on, you will go from styled and shiny to flat and greasy.  And once it goes, forget trying to style it back the way it was.  This gunk will stop you from doing anything with it by that point.  You will look exactly like the ringmaster from the Absinthe show in Las Vegas.  Google it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, it has a horrible plastic smell.  Others have described it as a perfume, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like an intentional scent.  The smell just doesn&#x27;t go away.  That will be the first thing everyone notices about you.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t provide any hold for my thick/coarse hair; might be ok for thin/soft hair. Also has a very strong orange candy-like smell that I think would only appeal to teenyboppers. Quickly went in the trash.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do what it says!  Didn&#x27;t define or shine hair, just made it greasy and flat!</li>
    <li> I got this on sale from cvs for $3.99 so tought it was worth a shot. I am a natural haired black female and I just got the left side of my hair cut low to a tapered fade style! I used this stuff on damp hair and I LOVED how slick and pretty it made it! But you have to let it air dry for it to stay neat. When going to bed I tie a scarf around my head to and in the morning it was still pretty slick! I find that if you want to re-slick it, DO NOT ADD MORE PRODUCT! Simply spray some water on it, jus a little, and comb or brush down and it will look good as new! This is not for texturizing as someone mentioned before. It works best for tapered short styles if you want them to be slick straight, like I wanted. I wanted my hair to look pretty and slick without using harmful chemicals like a relaxer to straighten it and this worked pretty good! And it&#x27;s a soft hold and no flakes! I almost opted for the glue by this company but glad I went with this one. I think the glue would have made it TOO hard looking! I rated it 4 stars only because I would of liked to get it a BIT more slicker but overall, for $3.99, it&#x27;ll do!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Looks good for a few hrs then it just looks like I never slicked it down! It&#x27;s not humidity proof so I think I&#x27;m gonna go with the glue made by them after all!!! I&#x27;ll just mix it with water to give it a slick wet and straight look! I think CVS had it on sale too for $3.99 so I&#x27;ll be going back there!</li>
    <li> A friend introduced me to this product after using American Crew Fiber.  This product does not make your hair stiff or shiny while still offering a great hold throughout the day</li>
    <li> Smells awful and doesn&#x27;t do its job.</li>
