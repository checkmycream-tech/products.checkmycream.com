<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> To combat my hair loss, I decided to triple up on my efforts by buying the hair growth shampoo, this conditioner and the hair regrowth supplement.  They have truly helped stimulate new hair growth and given me my confidence back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caffeine conditioner is one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used.  It leaves my hair super easy to comb through after showering and helps my hair to feel soft and revitalized throughout the day.  It isn&#x27;t heavy and smells amazing!  Also, it is naturally-derived and made with chamomile, peppermint, eucalyptus and rosemary oils.  So, you&#x27;re not putting a ton of junk on your hair.  Plus, the caffeine is cool.  It is an active ingredient that you can actually feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great conditioner and amazing hair regrowth product!</li>
    <li> Wonderful satisfaction all around great conditioner help with hair loss incredible ingredients. If you want that soft hair with less shedding you on the right path.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It is as good as any conditioner I have used for moisturizing and and a light fluffy feeling to your hair. Plus the added bonus of helping treat hair loss. In just a few weeks I have noticed a huge improvement in new hair. I would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> Amazing formula it keeps my hair soft on the dry Denver days (all days) without weighing it down or making it look greasy. The smell is very subtle and is a little similar to their other products. It goes great in hand with the shampoo and serum and as a result has given my a thicker mop. Just like the other products, it goes in easily and a little goes a long way so you won&#x27;t need to go through half the bottle for a weeks use. I&#x27;m excited to see the long term results as I continue treatment.</li>
    <li> Great product to use with hair surge shampoo. The ingredients are all natural and gentle on the scalp. For example the chamomile is great for soothing a sensitive scalp, and by calming irritation this encourages hair growth. Another noteworthy ingredient is eucalyptus Japanese studies have found this herb to strengthen the hairs root by improving elasticity. The conditioner has a thick silky texture and has a light clean scent. I have really noticed a difference, since using it in my hair. It is thicker and more supple, and for the price, definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> This was hands down the best restorative conditioner I have used. It comes out thick and lathers well. The scent was also really enjoyable; I find sometimes I just smell the bottle when it arrives. I was looking for something to boost my hair strength, especially after my third childbirth. I had a C-section and the stress, long hours and change in my diet left my hair thinning. My husband has an annoying habit of over researching everything and was looking for a caffeine based product that had some other unique ingredients. He found this one and purchased it for me. This time I have to admit it was worth it, although He could have just googled: “hair-falling out-shampoo” and read the great reviews of this one.  My sister buys it just to use after bleaching her hair and swears by it to.</li>
    <li> Ultrax lab conditioner is great and very helpful if you also pick up the shampoo. It does it job and more. It also doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair at all. Love the product would recommend to anyone looking for a product for hair lost</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I found this product!  It is just what I was looking for: a hair regrowth conditioner that really works!  I have tried many in the past and never seen the results that I am seeing now.  I have been using Ultrax&#x27;s conditioner for about 2 months and have noticed a steady difference.  I love the way it makes my hair feel and I can see the results in the bathroom mirror every time I get out of the shower.  I am extremely happy I took the risk of buying this product.  Thanks Utrax Labs!</li>
    <li> After searching and doing research on a conditioner that will help with my thinning hair and hair loss I came across Ultrax Labs Hair Solace Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Conditioner.  After using it for the first time, my hair felt and looked softer and fuller.  I love the fact it took only one try and I both felt and saw a difference in my hair.  For those of you who struggle with hair thinning and hair loss as I do you can appreciate finding a product that helps to alleviate the problem of hair loss.  I have been using this conditioner for a little over one month and I just love it.  I also use  Ultrax Labs shampoo for hair loss.  I recommend this conditioner to all people who are looking to have fuller hair and less hair loss. This is a must have in all bathrooms.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is a perfect compliment to Ultrax Labs shampoo! The fragrance is wonderful! Just a little goes a long way. It left my hair feeling smooth! I love this conditioner. I have tried just about every conditioner out there on the market. This by far is the best I have ever used. I will not buy anything else. I would highly reccomend this amazing conditioner. You will not be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I love all the products Ultrax Labs creates. Its an embarrassing condition for a young lady to deal with thinning hair, but these products have been keeping me confident. I typically use the shampoo and conditioner daily, and the hair lush whenever I  style. With the addition of biotin supplements, my hair is fuller than ever. These products have been great presents for my older brothers as well.</li>
    <li> Super effective product! I bought this for my grandma who suffers from thinning hair and she absolutely loves the results she&#x27;s achieved not to mention the lemony scent of this product! Very easy on the hair and not abrasive whatsoever! This is a product that can be used for anyone with thinning or complete hair loss :)</li>
    <li> This conditioner is a great combination product with the shampoo. It leaves hair nice and smooth and overall just feels amazing. Using it just occasionally leaves you with a great feeling in your hair, and it feels even better knowing it&#x27;s growing!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the shampoo and was very happy with the results I was getting with that and then I realized they had a conditioner to go with it. Between the two, it&#x27;s not a cheap combination but anything that&#x27;s good isn&#x27;t cheap, we all know that. So the conditioner leaves my hair looking great and thicker as well. I am definitely seeing some new sprouts of hair come up, which I attribute to the shampoo but I think the conditioner is aiding in my follicle recovery as well. 5-stars!</li>
    <li> Conditioner is important to me for my hair. I have thin hair that is quite staticky. This conditioner did wonders on both of those issues. My hair felt thicker and smoother than before. It&#x27;s a high quality product that I feel comfortable using for optimal results!</li>
    <li> I have always been in love with my hair, so when I started losing it around age 20 I was devastated! Would I end up completely bald like my father?? I wasn&#x27;t going to let that happen without at least trying to stop it. I tried the cheap, big-name hair loss products first, to no avail. The special &amp;#34;vitamins&amp;#34; and other chemicals did nothing but burn my scalp. I almost gave up when one of my friends suggested Ultrax Laboratories, she said that her entire family used it and loves it. Ultrax&#x27;s products had a great reputation and I still had to try something, so I got the caffeine shampoo and conditioner, and the lush serum.&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to use 5 times a week, so that&#x27;s what I did. Both the shampoo and the conditioner feel nice in my hair, they don&#x27;t burn my scalp at all like the other products I tried. After a few minutes of leaving it in I rinse it out, and when my hair is dry, there&#x27;s no grease or oil left behind! My hair is completely clean, and silky soft! I absolutely love it! After the first week I checked my balding spot, and there was already new little hair stubs growing! I am ecstatic, I have finally found a product that stopped my hair loss! By the time I finished my first bottles the little hair stubs were nearly two inches long! The rest of my hair is over two feet long, so it has a long way to go; but I am happy to have something helping me!&lt;br /&gt;I am buying my second bottles now and I definitely recommend the Ultrax shampoo and conditioner to anybody wishing to fight their hair loss! When they say &amp;#34;unrivaled results&amp;#34;, they really mean it!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is what you need to complete Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo. The complex does work, I don&#x27;t remember last time I picked my own dead hair from my clothes, or when I have had massive hair balls on my comb after brushing my hair. This conditioner made my hair shiny and easy to brush, I definitely feel how much stronger my hair have become. Good perches for those, who wants to fight hair-lost problem.</li>
    <li> The Solace Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Stimulating GrowthConditioner is equally as effective as the shampoo. Same great tingle to the scalp after applying and rinsing off is even easier. The multiple oils( Jojoba, Rosemary, Peppermint etc.) really moisturize the hair. I would say to always use the conditioner the same day as you use the shampoo for maximum effect. The natural ingredients are great softeners, which means less breakage so hair is eventually fuller because you are losing less. The final benefit is that the conditioner is more affordably priced than the shampoo but definitely use the two in conjunction with each other.</li>
    <li> The Ultrax team has done it again! This conditioner has all the right ingredients to promote healthy growing hair. Shampoo and  conditioner are a great combination!</li>
    <li> This product works miracles, i started using it two weeks ago and i already see visible results. Not to mention how soft and shiny it leaves my hair. Overall 5 out of 5.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with the shampoo Ultrax Labs Solace Hair Loss Shampoo, I was very excited to try the conditioner also. Now that I have my hair is even fuller and softer.  I continue to get compliments from everyone including how good my hair smells.  Ever since I was diagnosed with Lupus my self confidence was gone and now I walk around confident with head held high!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Fell in love with the shampoo and raved about it to friends &amp; family. My cousin bought the conditioner for me (as an early bday present) while buying the shampoo for herself. Let me just say, my hair has never been shinier, healthier and softer! I&#x27;ve always had split ends and my hair would take forever to grow. Lucky for me I avoided frizz with good serums, but with the Ultrax shampoo + conditioner I don&#x27;t even need serums anymore. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it; it&#x27;s worth a shot and it&#x27;s affordable. Both bottles so far have lasted 2 months, and I still have a good amount left. Only other product I use on my hair now is a keratin treatment once a week since I do have wavy hair. But other than that, this is what I stick to and I&#x27;m so glad I found this. Thanks to those who wrote a good review on the shampoo and enticed me to buy it! Worse that can happen is nothing works...but for me it&#x27;s gone above and beyond.</li>
    <li> Ultrax lab products feel very good on my hair, but this conditioner is extra spectacular! It doesn&#x27;t feel like it dries my hair out, it feels soft and strong while also increasing the volume in my hair. If you have thin hair I would definitely recommend using this product.</li>
    <li> Another wonderful product to join the shampoo in my shower! When I use this with the shampoo I&#x27;ve never had fuller thicker feeling hair. I think the ingredients say it all. The product stimulant and smells are amazing! Love love love this stuff! Try it!</li>
    <li> Perfect complement to the shampoo, delightful smell (I&#x27;m really sensitive to scents). Even if you aren&#x27;t trying to grow your hair thicker this is a lovely conditioner.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but not sure it if it helping with growth; I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple  few weeks and I am in love with it! It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of chemical so it is very easy on my hair and I like the smell of it as well. I use this together with their shampoo and I have accomplished less damage to my my hair and loss of hair then I have had the past several years. It definitely leaves my hair softer and more hydrated and fresh looking. I only use this conditioner about twice a week but it would&#x27;t heart to use it everyday with the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt; I Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Seems to be working; too early to tell.</li>
    <li> Fantastic condition. I have been struggling with insane shedding, breakage and thinning. I decided to purchase this product and I love it. With in the first week i noticed less shedding. Its been two months now and my hair has much less breakage and some new growth. I use the every single time I wash my hair. Like with anything it takes some patience and consistency but im so happy im starting to see the fruits of my labor!  Sometimes I skip the shampoo and just use this as a quick rinse. So far this has been great for me. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I have fallen in love with this product!  I have tried a few other products by Ultrax Lab, and using this conditioner combined with the Shampoo, leaves my hair feeling healthier than ever before.  I like to highlight my hair, which is dangerous if you do not have strong hair to begin with, so when I began using this conditioner I instantly felt that my hair was safe and strong.  The caffeine definitely makes a huge difference.  I love the way the conditioner smells as well!  Usually &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; shampoos and conditioners do not smell as nice!</li>
    <li> I have seen a difference in my hair. When I wash it there is hardly any hair in the tub. I noticed a difference after about 2 1/2  weeks of using this product 3 times a week. The down side is that the directions tell you to use it 5 times a week which is very expensive.</li>
    <li> I will be buying again. It worked wonders for my hair!</li>
    <li> Great product for hair loss!&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is an amazing product designed for both men and women. I love the consistency of the conditioner and leaves my hair clean without any oily residue. I would highly suggest using this in conjunction with the shampoo. Its a wonderful product that I would highly suggest to any other consumers.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do nothing for me, leaves my hair dry and not soft at all. I am not sure what is this for and why it is so expensive</li>
    <li> So many positive reviews, who to believe? Check the 1-2 star reviews which are honest unlike all the phony 5 stars. A lot of the 5 stars seem to be women so maybe it helps them more but that seems unlikely. I&#x27;m a guy and I used the conditioner for 6 weeks without any positive results whatsoever. It rubs on almost like lotion. It smells ok. I guess that can make it a one star. The high cost and lack of benefit really make it a no star though.</li>
    <li> Conditioner feels Great leaves your hair nice and shiny feeling extra smooth and clean use it almost everyday</li>
    <li> I officially have all 3 Ultrax products and I feel good about that. The shampoo and serum I use every few days but the conditioner is a winner. I have used it almost everyday for the last week. I don&#x27;t know if it is making my hair grow faster but it&#x27;s certainly more silky and smells nice too. It&#x27;s not as expensive as their other 2 products, which is a bonus. Anything that has caffeine is a winner by me.</li>
    <li> product makes you lose hair at an expedited rate...caveat emptor</li>
    <li> Great product! Leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with hair loss for some years now and have tried several different products with very little or no results.  I have been using this conditioner for a couple months now and I&#x27;m noticing new growth, which is a super exciting development for me!!  I&#x27;ve read that caffeine helps stimulate hair growth and from my experience that&#x27;s exactly what this conditioner offers you.</li>
    <li> For a while I didn&#x27;t realize that Ultrax made conditioner - believe me, it makes all the difference when used in conjunction with their caffeinated shampoo. I&#x27;m very pleased that I haven&#x27;t seen any more loss. If you&#x27;re tired of shedding like a dog, definitely give it a shot.</li>
    <li> I bought this almost a month ago and I&#x27;m so disappointed to say it never worked for me.  I was so hopeful after reading the reviews and how much I spent on the product itself.  I saw no regrowth nor did it grow faster.  I even was taking biotin during the time and nothing has helped.</li>
    <li> Because of the positive results I received from using Ultrax stimulation shampoo and hair lush serum, it only made sense to complete my hair care regimen using Ultrax Hair Solace stimulating conditioner.  The conditioner does not leave a heavy waxy buildup and that is good becuase my hair is thicker and more full from using Ultrax products.  I would not want to lose the thickness my hair now has.  The Hair Solace conditioner enforces hair growth, fullness, softness and adds shine.</li>
    <li> Ok, there is no way to prove this product is what is causing my hair to come back thicker than it was before chemo, and there is no way to prove it is this product that is preventing my new hair from falling out due to the female pattern baldness I had before chemo. But, I&#x27;m not going to stop using it because why fix what isn&#x27;t broken?</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t have to look any further for a great conditioner, you&#x27;ve found it with this one!  I have suffered from excessive shedding and hair loss for awhile now, but since using this product, I have seen a noticeable difference in my hair, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Unlike some other growth-promoting conditioners, this one is very light and leaves my hair soft, shiny, manageable and no greasy residue or heaviness.  My hair now looks fuller, and I notice less shedding than before.  I also like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it for it to work, so a little goes a long way.  Smells great too!  Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this conditioner, how my hair has regained it&#x27;s healthy bounce and thickness, and will be purchasing it again in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the entire line of hair care products because I absolutely love how thick and soft my hair feels after every use. I whole-heartedly recommend this product to anyone who has thin or lank hair because of how healthy and manageable my hair has become through extended use.  This is definitely worth its weight in gold!</li>
    <li> I love Ultrax products. I&#x27;m currently using the shampoo and the dietary supplement and have now added in the conditioner. I have psoriasis on my scalp and I find the chamomile assists in relaxing some of the inflammation I usually experience. I&#x27;ve massaged eucalyptus oil on my scalp and now its a bonus that I have it in my conditioner. And I&#x27;m amazed at how healthy and vibrant my hair looks. Hair loss can be troubling and having great products to rely on makes me feel more confident that I will keep my hair. I have a combination of thick wavy hair where I have a lot of it and thin hair where I don&#x27;t. The conditioner balances out the difference. Definitely recommend this conditioner for the sheen appearance! Thanks Ultrax Labs!</li>
    <li> This conditioner works great. It leaves your hair so soft and silky. . My hair is more silky shinier and  beautiful than ever.&lt;br /&gt; The caffeine is actually works wonders . You can feel the effect when you use the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is growing faster than ever. my results are amazing I will defiantly continue to use this</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Grew my hair back and my hair feeling lush. I highly recommend this product to everyone</li>
    <li> Who knew that caffeine would make your hair grow back?!  Ha maybe my hair just needed to wake up...in any case, this stuff works shockingly well!  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products, and this is the first one that&#x27;s really &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34;ed me.  The hair I still had is stronger and thicker, and areas that have been losing hair have started to regrow.  The eucalyptus is a nice touch...it gives this conditioner a nice, natural smell--not like the weird chemical smell some products I&#x27;ve tried have had.  Plus, it doesn&#x27;t leave a gross, sticky residue.  I definitely recommend this to anyone looking to keep their hair, and keep it looking natural!!</li>
    <li> I just got this a week ago and have been using it regularly. So far my hair has seemed to have more body to it. Will have to wait and see whether it actually stimulates any regrowth.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this conditioner to use in conjunction with the hair surge shampoo from the same company. I love it! Its a great complimentary product in fighting my hair breakage from previous coloring and perming. My hair feels healthier already and has more body and less breakage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m gonna get straight to the nuts and bolts. This product truly amazing.  From the very first time I used it my hair felt so soft and light. I loved the feeling.  It produces the right amount of Sud when using the recommended amount.  After about 2 weeks of using it I have notice hair growth in a part of my hair that was thinning.  Great product with amazing results.  I recommend this to whoever want to experience what I stated above..</li>
    <li> When I first purchased these products, I did so because my hair was not growing. I wasn&#x27;t losing any, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to grow at all. I was taking supplements that seemed fairly ineffective. I began using the shampoo first and had very good results. This conditioner is excellent. My hair is looking great. It is no more expensive than any other high level salon product. It glides through my hair and I only need to use a very small amount. My usual shampoo was always two bottles of conditioner to one bottle of shampoo. With this product is a 1:1 ratio. I like that. My hair is thicker, longer, shinier, and silkier than it has been in years - did I mention longer? It has grown noticeably and I am very happy!</li>
    <li> I really really like this conditioner. It is thick and goes on hair smoothly and smells great. My hair looks and feels amazing; it is soft, shiny and manageable. I also love the fact that it has so many natural oils as well as the caffeine.</li>
    <li> When paired with the ultrax hair shampoo this product works great. Leaves hair soft, manageable and looking fuller and or thicker. The moisturizing properties work well only needing 2 minutes to use.  Like the shampoo it doesn&#x27;t have a strong or overwhelming scent. It improves your hair the longer you use both the shampoo and conditioner as a combo.</li>
    <li> I have been super satisfied with my Ultrax Labs Hair Surge shampoo and &amp;#34;LUSH&amp;#34; hair treatment , the dietary supplements; my guy is also using the &amp;#34;Ultrax Labs&amp;#34; hair restoration as well and &amp;#34;looking re- fined&amp;#34;. One of his buddies wife just rang me ( Harold &amp; Margey have their hair loss &amp; thinning out issues as well and are amazed of the speedy restoration these  products take effect)however , when she had asked about the &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34;, i did forget to include this awesome, hair thickening, pleasantly explosive sensation on your scalp, and aromatically pleasing &amp;#34;major role player &amp;#34; of the Ultrax Labs hair regime.I love eucalyptus as it is a &amp;#34; feel better&amp;#34; ingredient that is so stimulating and soothing for hair &amp;  body reparations. The smell is intoxingly pleasant! Yes , please do the conditoner ; as a must do after shampoo!! Keep in mind ---the cost of this finer hair loss restorative system  is only a &amp;#34;fraction &amp;#34; of what an intrusive and self- conscientious visit to a hair specialist will be!!</li>
    <li> This is GOOD STUFF! I am amazed at the quality of products that Ultrax Labs continues to put out. They seem to use top quality ingredients in each of their products in order to deliver on the results that they promise.  My hair never looked so good! Who would&#x27;ve ever thought that by infusing caffeine into their mixture of ingredients that it would have such a positive impact on my hair?  Thanks to this formula I have seen new growth, a healthy shine, and the product smells good to boot!  Who would&#x27;ve ever guessed?  I&#x27;m thankful that I have found a product line that I can use on an ongoing basis to assist me in managing my hair maintenance needs.  Keep up the good work Ultrax!</li>
    <li> My name is Lisa Rosario since I have been using your product, my hair has been growing healthy</li>
    <li> This conditioner is amazing and works like a charm. It leaves my hair so soft,silky and renewed . It&#x27;s definitely give it tha revitalizing touch. My hair is more beautiful than ever and couldn&#x27;t be more happier.</li>
    <li> This company is awesome. I&#x27;ve used quite a few of their products and my hair truly shows the results! This conditioner is really good quality. It&#x27;s thick and super moisturizing. It glides over the hair easily, and makes it feel stronger and softer instantly. Plus, I use it with the shampoo and see my hair coming back! I highly recommend this product to anyone who is trying to regrow their hair and want softer, fuller and stronger hair!</li>
    <li> Another great product from Ultrax. Works just as advertised and definitely gets your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is amazing!!!!  My hair is stronger and healthier because of the unique oils this conditioner contains. After my shower my hair smells so good. My hair used to fall out when I brushed it but after using the conditioner for a few days my hair is thicker and stronger.  I love this product and will definitely encourage my friends to try it.</li>
    <li> nightmare, increased my hair loss and damaging to hair...very toxic and ruined 11 months of rogaine regrowth and stabilization</li>
    <li> Since I started using the ultrax caffeine conditioner my hair is so much better!  I have the shampoo also and use them together. I have noticed major results. My hair is so much stronger, way thicker and SHINY!!! I can’t get over how much healthier it is! Also my hair feels really soft and silky, I can’t stop touching it! Lastly, it smells like heaven.</li>
    <li> What an awesome product! I was skeptical about this product working, but after a week, my hair is thicker and I have less shedding. I work it into my hair immediately when I get in the shower and let it sit while I do my other shower things, then I rinse it out at the end. Works like a charm. I can&#x27;t wait to have a thicker more luscious head of hair by this summer. I&#x27;m hard on my hair, so something to counter the straightening iron, curlers and hair dryers and make my hair strong and less dry and brittle is WONDERFUL.</li>
    <li> Hair Solace is a great product to use if you want silky, thicker, and healthier hair. You will be amazed by the results achieved by using this conditioner. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a really good conditioner. I have been using this for quite some time and I love it. It only has to stay in for a few minutes and after I rinse it out I can instantly tell the change in my hair. It leaves my hair shiny and smelling great. This is my go to conditioner and I&#x27;m happy to have found a product like this.</li>
    <li> For quite some time I have been in pursuit of a good deep conditioner, which also aids in hair growth. After continuously searching through different products, I was very fortunate to come across this conditioner by Ultrax Labs (I have also previously purchased the Hair Maxx herbal supplement). Surprisingly, as soon as I opened the bottle of this conditioner, I was very pleased with the invigorating fragrance (Eucalyptus extract). I applied a small amount to clean hair, and left it on for several minutes, which resulted in a tingly sensation on my scalp. Seemingly, this product is an answer to my prayers, because it provides intense moisture to my extremely dry hair. Despite hoping for instant gratification in terms of hair growth, I plan to give this product a little more time for the full benefit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprisingly shocked that this really works!!!! I must say I tried this with a bit of pessimism and maaaannnn was I silenced!!! This actually works!!! I have been having issues with breakage and hair shedding for years and the first change I noticed was a decline in the shedding. Then the breakage obviously and now, I have started noticing new hairs in places like &amp;#34;receding hairline&amp;#34;. Simply put, DUMBFOUNDED!!! Thanks Ultrax Lab Hair Solace..</li>
    <li> Ultra labs hair growth products seem do the trick lot ways, if you need good shampoo, then Ultra labs products does it with their shampoo, that feels soft, thick and on the go realistic in growing ones hair back, overtime my belief, just seems as professional source in growing back your hair men/women. just as the shampoo ultra Labs provides, comes their conditioner that does the same job, rehancing, greater works, and after shampoo rinse to make that hair yours grow back. The conditioner my belief is must with their shampoo product, just as any shampoo product that needs conditioner after its use, so do get this product with its companion, more benefits of growing back your hair use their products. Want your hair grow back, do try Ultra Labs products, must when growing back your hair.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I first bought this, but I thought I would try it because my hair has been falling out and I don&#x27;t want to become bald. After a few days of using it, my hair loss decreased and after a few weeks it seems to have stopped falling out.</li>
    <li> I did not experience any of the positive effects from combining this product with the shampoo and hair treatment.  It almost seemed to get worse after starting to use this.</li>
    <li> I tried so many products for my hairs but unhappy all the time. After using this product my hair became soft and silky. And also by continously using this product my hair also start growing fast then before. Love it</li>
    <li> seems to work I am losing less hair</li>
    <li> I cannot express my love for this conditioner in mere words. It has made my hair stronger and healthier just within a couple of uses - I am so impressed with this and its unique use of caffeine makes this conditioner WORK. My hair is more beautiful than ever and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair falling off as often anymore because I&#x27;ve already seen it work. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> Oh this is heaven. It smells fantastic and makes my hair soft and silky and THICK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I want everybody to keep in mind that this is a CONDITIONER,but still is great to mix with shampoo if you choose too.Make sure to RINSE WELL..........,because hair afterwards will be very soft without feeling like a heavy burden in you.If you are a Men, you are in luck as it will work well too.Good thing it is made in the USA as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner to pair with the accompanying shampoo. I have found that no one product works 100% perfectly for hair loss prevention, but combined - they work wonders! Along with the other Ultrax products, this conditioner has helped speed my hair&#x27;s growth and slow its loss dramatically. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> None of the products that I&#x27;ve bought so far have disappointed me. This one is now in my regular rotation because of how great my hair has been after only a few uses. Very happy customer.</li>
    <li> I liked this product from the first day I used it, but that doesn’t surprise me because I’ve been very happy with all of the Ultrax Labs products I’ve tried. I love the way this conditioner makes my hair feel, and I love the fact my hair is much less frizzy, it feels soft and silky and I have no tangles after showering !  I’ve also noticed that there is a lot less hair falling out, I don’t see anything in the drain which is an added plus.  Like most of us, I’m very hard on my hair, it’s color treated, I blow dry it, I use a flat iron or curling iron but through it all this conditioner works it’s magic and my hair looks amazing, I haven’t seen it looking this good in years. I have shoulder length hair, and just a small dab is all I use, so don’t be fooled by the size of the bottle, a little goes a long way.  I’ve tried various less expensive products, but I had to use more and the results weren’t as good.  I totally recommend this product – I give it 5 stars !!!</li>
    <li> This conditioner works great !! My hair is growing faster then ever ..I love my hair now :)</li>
    <li> This conditioner is the best! I use it almost every day and it leaves my hair feeling soft and luscious, and it smells awesome.  More recently I have been worried about my hair thinning out, but after using this conditioner for about 3 weeks now I&#x27;ve noticed my hair has actually grown thicker in those patches. I also use the Ultrax Labs Caffeine Hair Loss Shampoo and the combination is giving me really positive results; I&#x27;m really impressed.  There are a bunch of natural oils in it for moisture but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy, plus the caffeine which stimulates growth.  I would definitely recommend giving Ultrax Labs a try; it worked for me!</li>
    <li> I used for 8 months along with the caffeine shampoo and the only thing it did was cause shedding (no regrowth). Definitely not worth the price and I agree the reviews here must be fake.</li>
    <li> Super impressed with this product. Arrived same day, packaged just right for a liquid item in it&#x27;s own bag (just in case of spills). Smells amazing like a sweet mint almost which I love!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any positive impacts with this product. It was a waste of my money. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I never thought to try it with the caffeine infused shampoo until a friend mentioned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is very creamy and lightweight. And the caffeine gives it an added boost which I can actually feel my hair soak up. I generally massage it into my scalp after shampooing, leave it on for a few minutes and then rinse. My hair has never been so quenched! And paired with the Ultrax hair loss shampoo, I&#x27;m seeing results almost instantly. My hair feels fuller and I&#x27;m noticing less and less shedding on my pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most hair loss products make my scalp and hair greasy and unmanageable but not Ultrax. I whole heartedly recommend this conditioner to anyone experiencing frustrating hair loss…pair it with the Ultrax shampoo if you can!!</li>
    <li> Yes it is a bit costly but it is worth the price!  After about 3 weeks of using it and my hair feels thicker, can&#x27;t wait too have a full thick head of hair soon!</li>
    <li> What a wonderful conditioner! It leaves my hair smooth, silky and shiny; yet, it also easy to style. Because I have fine hair, conditioners historically have left my hair too silky and difficult to style. This conditioner does not do that. Instead I get to enjoy the silkiness and shininess of a great conditioner, while concurrently having my hair easier to style. What a delightful and refreshing change. I strongly recommend this product to any one who has fine or thinning hair.</li>
    <li> This product is truly amazing. My hair felt so soft and light, I loved the feeling. . I have notice hair growth in a part of my hair that was thinning. Great product with amazing results. I recommend this to whoever want to experience what I stated above..</li>
    <li> This is great stuff because it actually works. I can feel my hair being fuller and thicker after I use it. There is definitely some science behind Ultrax Labs that is going into the production of this great product. It stimulates my hair and since using it I have noticed that I have zero hair loss.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product! Highly recommend it for anyone that is going through or knows anyone that has hair loss.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! It smells amazing and it makes my hair easy to detangle.</li>
    <li> If you use this together with the shampoo your hair will feel fresh and rejuvenated.  Plus the new hair growth happens after the first few shampoos.  Nice sized bottle for the price.  This works just as good as rogaine.  I would say everyone should use this.  My hair has been feeling extra healthy.  It also is much shinier.  It has a nice scent and not to perfumey.</li>
    <li> appears to be a good product, but it is to early to tell.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner look no further! I also use the matchig shampoo in conjuction with it and experiencing amazing results. Not only do I notice a change in the thickness of my hair but the conditioner leaves my hair so silky smooth. All while leaving my hair smelling so wonderful from the essential oils! I highly recommend this to everyone, even people with sensitive scalps like myself.</li>
    <li> The consistency of the product is very nice and thick and goes on smoothly into your hair. The product is so moisturizing that I didn&#x27;t have to use nearly as much as I would with any other  conditioner. It really makes your hair soft. I have seen major improvement in my hair as far as texture as well as shine. I like it so much that I want to get the shampoo now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a load of fuey. Don&#x27;t even waste your time.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is great! It is the prefect compliment to the Ultrax Labs Hair Loss Hair Growth Caffeine Stimulating Shampoo. Using the two together has given me amazing hair growth and volume! The conditioner always gives my hair the perfect after-salon feel, right from the comfort of my home! My hair feels soft, smooth, tangle-free and super voluminous after I use it. A little really does go a long way; I would recommend starting with less at first to make sure you don&#x27;t get product buildup, which would ruin that gorgeous soft, voluminous effect you&#x27;re going for; although with such a lightweight feel, I don’t think this would ever even be a problem! This conditioner is great because it works top-to-bottom: at the roots of the hair to encourage hair growth and discourage hair loss and at the tips to discourage split ends and encourage manageability. In other words, this stuff rocks!</li>
    <li> It makes my hair feel nice and soft. But I&#x27;m still losing the same amount of hair and I have no new hair growth. It&#x27;s been a month since I&#x27;ve been using this too. I definitely think the other reviews are fake.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I purchased it because my hair began to fall out, and this product not only helped to end excess shedding but now my hair is growing back fuller and faster! Within using the Growth Stimulation Shampoo and Conditioner weekly, I saw immediate results. The conditioner is full of hydrating ingredients that also deeply condition without weighting the hair down. I would give this product ten stars if I could. It is that good! That is why I will defiantly repurchase when the time comes.</li>
    <li> Upon receiving this product, there was a bit of skepticism that the Hair Solace would improve the quality of my hair after 1 wash. The conditioner has a minty/ menthol smell that is not overpowering. It smells clean. I shampooed my hair with head and shoulders shampoo. Following that, I applied a quarter sized amount of the conditioner to my hair. I set the timer for 2 minutes. Upon rinsing, I immediately noticed that my hair felt super soft. The conditioner ran easily through my hair, and it had a bit of a cooling sensation. I do not blow dry my hair, but I do run a brush through it. My hair upon drying was noticeably fuller, and had shiny dimensions to it. This was after 1 use. I plan to continue using it, as I have a lot of hair, but it is short and color treated, and this was the first time my hair looked healthy and was manageable.</li>
    <li> I  purchased this product because I suffered from chronic hair loss over the past few years and  this product not only helped to end of my hair loss but help reduce the shedding  of my hair. Now  using this product every week my hair is growing back twice as fast  than it ever did! Within using this, I saw a dramatic  change in my hair growth. The conditioner is full of hydrating  and  has natural ingredients that won&#x27;t damage  your hair. It&#x27;s just a really good product to speed up your hair growth. Overall I&#x27;m really satisfied with the product and. I would highly recommend this product to people who want to grow their hair back naturally and fast and safe this stuff  really gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for at a fraction of the price! Excellent customer service and quick delivery!</li>
    <li> Perfect with Ultrax shampoo, combining Caffeine, Eucalyptus, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil and Chamomile works to stimulate hair follicles to rejuvenate tired and damaged hair. Perfect for unisex and smells fantastic. Results are instantaneous after one wash, leaves healthy shine and freshness, volume to hair. Recommend this product for anyone wanting nutrients to dull hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is perfect for damaged hair or hair that is falling out. After a few uses I&#x27;ve seen a big difference. It makes my hair feel so soft and healthy.  I would definitely recommend this product for everyone that wants to get their hair healthy or just want to improve their hair in general.</li>
    <li> did not see a difference</li>
    <li> This conditoner is soo good! My hair is soft and silky and it smells so good My hair is strong and I see less breakage everyday.I always get compliments on m hair now. I would definitely buy this again</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my hair loss. As a conditioner it works well and gets the conditioning job done...it is thicker than regular conditioners</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re experiencing noticeable hair loss with Ultrax Labs Hair Solace Conditioner you&#x27;ll experience noticeable results. Conditioner works very well for thinning hair. Your hair will seem thicker and more manageable. Unlike other conditioner, this product is not greasy and help with frizz. The conditioner works well with ultra labs shampoo as well as others. The scent is very pleasant too, this is a great product!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a good experience with this product. Easy to apply. I am happy with the results! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using ultrax products on my hair for a few months now. This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. It smells great. It is thick but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair heavy or with residue. It leaves my hair soft and shiney. My hair is growing in much thicker. Using the shampoo and then the conditioner has done wonders to my thinning hair. The shampoo is great but this conditioner pulls everything together and gives my limp thinning hair bounce and shine whilst helping it grow back more!</li>
    <li> Liked the ultrax shampoo for the results so use this as the conditioner. Works great with my regiment for hair loss and makes my hair feel great out of the shower. Im counting on the fact that this gives an additional boost to kicking my hair loss , so all the better.</li>
    <li> It is a great product. My hair are thick, and look a lot healthier. However it is a little expensive.</li>
    <li> In just a few weeks, not only has this product made me hair fuller and with new growth, but it is also tangle free and soft. I get compliments every day. My hair is full, shiny. This product is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner! Had to buy it!!!</li>
    <li> This conditioner works really well! I use it with Ultrax Labs Hair Surge shampoo and pairing these two products together has given me stellar improvements in my hair quality and fullness. I highly recommend trying this conditioner and taking the next step to solving your fading hair ordeal. In addition to my great results this conditioner smells amazing and leaves my scalp feeling fresh and rejuvenated so I have no problem using it everyday.</li>
    <li> After using this product during a shower, my hair fell out at an alarming rate. I was so scared, but decided to give it a try again. Second trial, same result. Hair got weaker with just two treatments as well. So much hair was lost from two treatments that I had to clean the drainage! Absolutely horrific product. Avoid at all cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to poor quality of the product, the company advertises in a very misleading manner. Majority of the accounts that gave a 5-star review are fake accounts. They only have one or two reviews, the other one being the shampoo version. I know that the most important factor in purchase is usually rating, and that&#x27;s why I was also a victim. Please do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> I use the shampoo and serum from this line and love them...they help my hair&#x27;s texture and strength and have begun to make it grow in where it was thin. I just recently tried the conditioner. I was reluctant to try it because I have dry hair and I wasn&#x27;t sure it would be rich enough, but it works incredibly well as a conditioner.  Right after conditioning, my hair is easier to comb through and doesn&#x27;t get frizzy and now that I have been using it for a few weeks, I can see that the conditioner has also improved the overall health of my hair and contributed to the regrowth around my hairline, where it was getting thin.  It smells great, but not with an overpowering, perfumed scent that lingers too long...it&#x27;s just a pleasant smell in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using the whole system, including this conditioner. You see a difference in your hair&#x27;s texture and condition right away and in a few weeks you see the regrowth happening.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!!!!!!! I decided to try Ultrax labs hair Solace after hearing a friend talk about it. My hair was dry, brittle and it was thinning. I started using this product and with in a couple of rinses, I seen and feel the difference. My hair feels great has a beautiful volume when I blow it out and beautiful curls when wet. Ultrax Labs Hair Solace has made me feel more confident with my look and my style. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT... I will definitely recommend you too try it.</li>
    <li> This works really well. My hair is stronger, softer and has less frizz. It feels and looks thicker and healthier. I saw results pretty quickly, as well. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This conditioner has an amazing smell. I can&#x27;t begin to say how grateful I am for this product. I have tried the Ultrax Labs shampoo before, but using it with this conditioner has made my hair even softer and more manageable. The good thing about this conditioner is that it&#x27;s fairly light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down on the hair. My hair is also thicker and fuller too. I will continue to purchase this conditioner in the future.</li>
    <li> I was not very hopeful this product would help me with my thinning hair. I&#x27;ve always had somewhat thin hair, and now in my 30&#x27;s I seem to be losing more hair. This product is amazing. I have new hair growth, a thicker hair line ! My hair dresser was shocked. She said I had significant hair growth in only 4 weeks. I&#x27;m so excited about his product.</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner in hopes of giving my hair a little extra boost and was not disappointed! The jury is still out on hair regrowth as I am young enough to not be dealing with hair loss BUT my hair feels thick and strong and I have noticed less shedding in the shower. The caffeine feels rejuvenating. It&#x27;s an added bonus that this conditioner smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> I got this with the hair growth shampoo by Ultrax at my local salon. I told them my hair was thinning and I just needed something that actually worked and I wanted a professional&#x27;s opinion. There was a bunch of different things, but they told me that this was brand would make the biggest difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure if I needed conditioner, since it was pricey together, but I&#x27;m glad I went with my stylist&#x27;s opinion. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, and I saw results by 2 weeks. The shampoo literally made baby hairs grow out and my hair now grows thicker! The conditioner makes my hair really soft and smooth. Smells nice too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest using just a small amount each time, it&#x27;s pretty concentrated stuff.</li>
    <li> Fast and easy transaction! Need to wait to see results of product so 2 weeks using it my hair looks and feels smooth.</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner in conjunction with the shampoo and feel the same about both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner feels great on my scalp and in my hair. I like the way it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not heavy like some conditioners so it leaves my hair perfect for styling and gives it the volume I’ve been missing for a while since my hair has gotten thinner with age and over processing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said in the shampoo review, I could go for a bigger bottle but, overall I really like this conditioner and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the the Ultrax Labs serum and my hair has stopped breaking off and is actually bouncy now. The conditioner is so luscious and smells great. I am so grateful to thicker bouncier hair now. Its a perfect addition to using the serum. I&#x27;m not embarrassed about thinning hair anymore.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as his thinning hair has really been bothering him lately.  He has tried many other products with little to no success.  However, with this product has shown results within weeks.  His hair is fuller and stronger.  He needed a hair cut a week before he normally gets one.  We will be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> Smells like candy, If you don&#x27;t mind the strong scent of Pez on your head. I could not stand it.&lt;br /&gt;Also it&#x27;s real thick, hard to apply. Could not stand to use it long enough to know if it works,&lt;br /&gt;Nice thinner size bottle for travel, but don&#x27;t  think it&#x27;s worth its cost.</li>
    <li> As a shampoo it&#x27;s fairly good, have not necessarily any effect of it. I would give it 5 stars for the way hair feel after it and the smell. Honestly, can&#x27;t say if that reduces hair loss. For those that are looking for serious product should read other reviews, because I have looked at the effect after only 1 bottle.</li>
    <li> Great product! Leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth! Has a great smell and it works! I would recommend this to anyone who likes to take care of their hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is truly amazing! It leaves my hair feeling fuller, thicker and silky smooth.  After using it, I am able to untangle my hair so much more easily and it smells fantastic!  I would definitely recommend this conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic!  I trust this company with every hair on my head.  Balding is perhaps my biggest fear and I really feel like covering all my bases is necessary to make me feel like in trying my best.</li>
    <li> This was sort of a impulse purchase, I saw it and said let me just try it to see if it would help thicken my crown area. It feels great once it&#x27;s in, kind of a tingling feeling, and it reminds me of vo5, it also seems to be volumizing my crown area. To truly grow and maintain your hair, you need to attack your hair growth from the inside and outside. You will need a great hair growth regimen, which has three major components: a healthy eating plan, substantial water intake, and a high quality hair growth and hair care product like this one!.. so whether your experiencing hair loss or not this is a great product to add to your regimen.</li>
    <li> After just one use, my hair shines brighter and felt silkier than ever before! I have curly hair and this product really gave volume to my curls, there also was no greesy feeling afterwards. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to take their hair up to the next level.</li>
    <li> After spending a great amount of money on my Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo (there is my separate review on it too) and seeing positive results from using it, I was not fully sure if it would be necessary to buy this conditioner and how additionally it could remedy my hair loss and benefit me further with my hair growth. However it only took me a week to realize that this conditioner is a perfect pair with the shampoo and still a must-buy even if you already have the Shampoo. I can clearly see the differences in my hair texture and thickness between when I use it and when I do not use it. I usually do not immediately wash the conditioner off of my hair after applying it but rather massage my scalps and hair for minutes with it so that its substances do the necessary job on the problematic areas. Highly recommended to those who would like to maximize the results of using the Ultrax Labs Hair Products!</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs continues to produce great products. After using the awesome Hair Surge Shampoo, I&#x27;ve since been hunting for a complementary conditioner. Long behold, I found the Hair Solace Caffeine Conditioner. With active ingredients such as chamomile, eucalyptus, caffeine, and simmondsia chinensis seed oil, my hair feels refreshed, clean and revitalized. My hair is soft, manageable, and healthy. By the way, the smell of both products is great; neither has a strong, over-powering smell. I can say, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> The ultrax hair solace conditioner is so perfect! I have tried so many conditioners in the past to make my hair softer, fuller, and more vibrant. I feel so lucky that i was able to find a product that does all three of these things equally as well! Usually with conditioners I would have to use a pretty large amount each time in order to make my hair feel soft enough that it would last me even after I got out of the shower. With this conditioner all I had to use was a very small amount and it worked just like magic. I saw results very quickly too with the volume of my hair. My hair is usually thin and lifeless but this product gave it so much body and fullness. I am so impressed I would recommend it to everyone whether you need fullness, manageability, or just some added softness and shine. I will be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT! I feel like a chia pet and a new man. My hair was thinning and falling out now that i&#x27;m nearing almost 40 and I was very self conscious and would wear a hat all the time until I tried this product. In just months, my hair is growing like a weed. It&#x27;s thicker, fuller and feels great.It smells really good as well. I&#x27;ve tried other ones and they smelled horrible. I definitely recommend getting this, to anyone who&#x27;s skeptical.</li>
    <li> Pair this conditioner with the shampoo. It helps with excessive shedding and creates more thickness. I love the quantity of bottle and the great smell.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Used it for a week and started seeing results already! Hair feels soft and silky after use!</li>
    <li> So far I like it.  I can see that less hair is falling out.</li>
    <li> This product is crap! I splurged on this over priced shampoo and conditioner because I was desperate. It turned out to be a waste of money! Don&#x27;t listen to the 5 star reviews...they are spam.</li>
    <li> This conditioner has a very nice smell. It is worth to use for that reason alone. But, I have to say that I have been really impressed with the Ultrax Labs products. This conditioner makes my hair really soft and silky. Also, it leaves my hair feeling moisturized and is a surprisingly good detangler. It is easy to use, has a light, not overpowering fragrance, and helped me get results. Using it in conjunction with other Ultrax Hair products has done wonders for my hair. My hair feels thicker and theres almost absolutely no more hair loss.</li>
    <li> This is an OK conditioner but for the price, I was very disappointed. Used the whole bottle but did not see any improvement in the thickness of my hair. I will not be purchasing anymore.</li>
    <li> This product has been so useful. My hair I&#x27;d thicker and soft and untangled . This has gave me some relief from my hair thinning and now starting to grow back and become fuller. I finally found something that works.</li>
    <li> This conditioner has a very nice smell. It is worth to use for that reason alone. Everyone should always test a small section of hair when trying a new shampoo for the first time to see if there will be any negative effects. As far as the growth, this shampoo is great for some and the growth can be increased if you spend a little extra time really massaging it into your scalp to increase blood flow.</li>
    <li> Yucky feeling and consistency</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo and conditioner both trying to curb the thinning and weakening of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided for the price it was worth a gamble and I after a few weeks I am very happy I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has a strong wake up fragrance and on a Monday at 6:00 in the morning we all could use a little help waking up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For lathering it does a decent job and my hair feels clean and great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the conditioner with each wash and I feel that it has helped not only with strenth of my hair but also adds to the control I am actually using less product now in my hair because my hair will stay put and I am no longer trying to keep it tame on windy days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not really any drawbacks on either right now and if you are thinning a little or want to boost your hairs strength I would say give it shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice that there is not hair in the sink in the mornings anymore and I contribute it to the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works better at making my hair feel smooth than the major brand product I used before. It has a great smell and helps immensely with my hair loss. I use it with the ultrax hair surge shampoo and I won&#x27;t switch to anything else.</li>
    <li> This is a great compliment to the hair surge shampoo. The conditioner smells phenomenal and leaves hair feeling hydrated and soft. Well worth it.</li>
    <li> I am finally using all the products in this line for my hair and am delighted by the the synergistic effects.  I use the shampoo and the serum so I decided that the conditioner would be a logical step in the routine to get the absolute best results and so far I&#x27;ve not been disappointed. This product makes my hair so silky smooth, has a pleasant smell and my hair dries shiny - my curls are loose and natural - no frizz. I&#x27;ve found the best &amp;#34;solace&amp;#34; for my hair woes.</li>
    <li> My hair felt so soft and light, I loved the feeling. . I have notice hair growth in a part of my hair that was thinning.The cost is a little more expensive, but the product is definitely worth the money. Both the conditioner and shampoo will give you good results.I love the smell of this product, and the way it left my hair feeling after use.Another great product from Ultrax. Works just as advertised and definitely gets your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I have been using these conditioner for a little while now.  I started using it after noticing some unfortunate hair loss.  I have had some awesome results.  I use it with  Ultrax Labs Hair Surge shampoo and my hair has seemed thicker and grows in faster.  My wife says I look great.  I strongly recommend you give this a shot.</li>
    <li> I picked this up right after I got the Ultrax Labs Shampoo because like any good shampoo, you will have a little dryness. Hey, that&#x27;s the price of really clean hair. This really does go well with their shampoo because of the ingredients they use. The eucalyptus smells fantastic and is invigorating but it&#x27;s not over powering. I also like using things with a nice blend of natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> This product did good making my hair feel thick but also soft and clean. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have to say how much I love this product. It is so moisturizing and feels great on my scalp. It does exactly as described and I love the feel of my hair afterwards. This is a quality conditioner and worth every penny!</li>
    <li> seems to work pretty well at what it says it does. However, I know hair loss products are more on the expensive side, but this one you&#x27;ll have to trade your gold for. It is incredibly expensive. I though $50 was expensive for a 8 - 12 month supply, well this one will last about a month. It&#x27;s incredibly small and expensive, needs to be way cheaper to receive a 4-5 Star rating.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for just a few weeks and I am in love with it! It is mild on my hair and I like the smell of it as well. I use this together with their shampoo and I have accomplished less damage to my my hair, such as breakage and loss of hair then I have had the past several years. It definitely leaves my hair softer and more hydrated and fresh looking. I only use this conditioner about twice a week. I Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have a whole family of men who are losing/have lost their hair. Along with other steps, this conditioner and shampoo brand has kept me with a full head of hair. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> To soon to tell yet, I have only used it for 2 weeks.  It certainly in a nice product, but I can&#x27;t say yet how much it will improve hair loss.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Great buy and excellent choice. Great brand and I&#x27;ve never used it before but I am very impressed.</li>
    <li> A great pairing with the stimulating caffeine shampoo. My stepmom loves the fact it leaves her hair silky soft while treating her hair loss.</li>
    <li> I use this with the shampoo and have naturally dry skin so I find the Chamomile really helps sooth my scalp.  My hair is short and I live in a humid climate, I only have to use a little of this conditioner and I leave it in as I finish my shower and rinse out. Lots of moisture and body without the frizz or heavy weighed down feeling. As far as the hair re-growth, I am sold.  Using this with the shampoo has, in a month, given amazing regrowth results.  I am very happy with this brand.</li>
    <li> Loved It, Just like rest of its line. it adds shine, and make your hair feel stronger and thick.... and i love the feeling of it. im gald i purchased it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, I love how my hair feels after using it. It also makes styling my hair so much easier.</li>
    <li> I just started using the Hair Solace Conditioner because of the great results I have been getting with the shampoo in the last 2 months!!  I love how fresh and invigorating the two together leave my scalp feeling and how thick and shiny my hair has been lately!  I would definitely recommend the two together.</li>
    <li> After trying the shampoo and loving it, I had to get the conditioner and I&#x27;m so glad I did. My hair has shown such a great difference since I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner. My hair has more body and volume and looks fuller. It also makes my hair so soft and silky feeling. This conditioner also smells amazing! So happy!</li>
    <li> This is a good conditioner. It leaves my hair feeling very soft and I&#x27;ve noticed that it doesn&#x27;t break as much. Also my bottle has lasted for a month so far, you only need to use a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin hair and I was really hoping that this would make a noticeable difference. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month. It does help add a little thickness, and I&#x27;m hoping that over time my hair will become fuller. But most importantly I&#x27;ve noticed less breakage and shedding (less hair in my shower drain after I wash it and less to clean up after combing). This conditioner has also has a nice soft smell.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!! It leaves your hair with shiny full volume and even thickens your hair for more volume!!!! I have to stock up on this product because it is the best!!!!</li>
    <li> Let me say first that I am not looking for a miracle.  There is really not much that can be done from an 8oz bottle of shampoo that can alter genetics, reverse years of burning on a blower and flat iron, or remove damage from chemically frying my hair for  an entire lifetime.  That being said I do need a LOT of help.  The amount of breakage i experience on a daily basis is actually quite frightening.  No woman wants to lose her hair. I ordered this product after reading he wonderful reviews.  I make my own soaps and I use coffee in all of them so I know that it works.  I was excited to find it in a shampoo.  Again, this isn&#x27;t a miracle.  I didn&#x27;t wake up and find long strong perfectly undamaged locks comparable to rapunzel. What I did find, however, is a LOT less breakage.  My hair does feel a bit thicker.  Perhaps it is &amp;#34;stimulated growth&amp;#34; perhaps it&#x27;s the fact that it&#x27;s a bit more protected, I do not know.  Honestly I do not care!! I noticed a difference and that is HUGE for me!  It is very thick and he lather isn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;bubbly&amp;#34; as I am used to but that makes no matter.  It smells very sweet, kind of like a candy. Personally I like a sweet smell for my hair.  Overall I find the product incredible!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this conditioner!!!  I got the shampoo to start and I really enjoyed it so I got this as a supplement.  I really like it and definitely adds to the shampoo as my hair continues to come in nicely.  I would highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Every now and then I get a deep conditioning treatment from the salon, and I can honestly say that this conditioner is so much better.  Leaves my hair so manageable and healthy-feeling.  I use this with the Hair Surge shampoo, and the two together are amazing.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is one great conditioner, i suffer from thin frizzy shedding hair at 42 ,this conditioner has help my hair get its life back. leaves hair soft full and no frizz, use with with their shampoo and whalla perfect hair in a bottle. great great hair condirioner.</li>
    <li> This product is sooo good. It has made my hair grow and stop breaking off. I recommend this product to anyone whose hair is falling out or breaking off. This is A good product and the smell is great and it&#x27;s not too greasy and it works. The only thing is I wish they made a bigger bottle or at least sell them in a 2-pack.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is amazing!  Not only does it smell amazing and leaves my hair shiny and manageable, but it&#x27;s actually treating my hair.  I can see an honest difference in the thickness of my hair after just a few uses.  Very impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> I am 22 year old female. Out of no where i started experiencing severe hair loss (most likely stress related) and i turn to Ultrax after reading ALL the positive reviews. Well let me tell you that it DOES NOT WORK. In fact ever since Ive started using this product I&#x27;ve noticed that my scalp is itchy and I have been developing bumps (pimple like) on and around my scalp. Whether its an allergic reaction or not. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY</li>
    <li> The conditioner + The Shampoo are making my hair feel fuller already!</li>
    <li> Just started using this product and so far, so good.  I love the Eucalyptus smell and I really feel like my scalp is being stimulated.  Can&#x27;t wait to see the positive results with continued use.</li>
    <li> So far Ultrax Labs conditioner has drastically helped improve the strength and overall health of my hair.  I&#x27;ve had much less breakage and fewer split ends, but I HAVE noticed new hair growth.  It leaves my hair feeling moisturized and is a surprisingly good detangler.  Plus, the conditioner is not too thick and rinses out well so my hair is not &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; or weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using conditioner after every wash (regardless of what shampoo I use) and it smells just like any other conditioner.  I love that there is no strong or medicated odor.  I plan continue using Ultrax Labs stimulating conditioner as long as I keep getting these results.</li>
    <li> An awesome hair loss prevention product! While perhaps a bit pricey, easily worth every penny, as it works! You&#x27;ll never need another. Solace caffeine is an awesome variety, it feels refreshing and invigorating, while doing it&#x27;s job. Can&#x27;t really ask for more in a product. It leaves the hair feeling manageable and strong-feeling, perhaps as a result of the energizing formula. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone with hair!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell much and does nothing to reduce hair loss.  Total waste of money</li>
    <li> I love this product! Very nice scent and great for conditioning my plus growing my hair back! Great for anyone who has thinning hair!:)</li>
    <li> I have been experiencing increasing hair loss for a few years now.  I have tried many products that are on the market, and none have worked as well for me as Ultax Labs.  I use this conditioner in conjunction with their shampoo, and the results have been great.  This conditioner is thick and rich, and does a good job of nourishing the hair from root to tip.  It washes out quickly and easily and leaves hair soft and manageable without weighing the hair down.  I have extremely long hair and I am able to comb through the hair easily with less breakage and shedding.  This conditioner has a nice, pleasant scent, perfect for both sexes.  I use this conditioner daily, and leave the conditioner in for a few minutes, making sure to thoroughly massage into my scalp.  If you put in the time to use as directed, you will notice hair regrowth and less hair loss and breakage.  It is an investment, but well worth the price.</li>
    <li> product is amazing, I&#x27;ve tried countless this is by far the best and most effective</li>
    <li> This conditioner is unparalleled since it leaves your hair soft, conditioned, and aids the hair growth process. You leave it on your hair for at least 10 minutes for the most effectiveness would be my suggestion. Within 2 weeks you&#x27;ll notice your hair will be stronger and more hair follicles have appeared as well. I would also suggest to use the shampoo in conjunction with the conditioner for the most effectiveness of this product. Give it time and it will work wonders just take care of your hair like you care.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs conditioner is concentrated, leaves hair soft and manageable, and is perfectly scented (a slight aroma without being overpowering).  I use it in combination with Ultrax shampoo, and the pair has done wonders for the appearance of my hair.  It takes very little of this conditioner for it to do its magic.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product together with Ultrax shampoo and the results have been amaizing. This is the most effective conditioners that i have used so far. It is easy to use and it has reduced my hairloss and I nolonger loose my hair like I used to and most of my hair that i had lost has regrown. for the period of time that i have used this conditioner i have not experienced any negative effects.</li>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner along with the shampoo for about 3 months now (as well as horsetail and biotin) and I have to say it definitely WORKS! MY hair has not only grown faster, it&#x27;s STOPPED FALLING OUT IN CLUMPS and it&#x27;s finally growing back heathy and long, something I was afraid w</li>
    <li> This produt is amazing! It works perfectly in conjunction with the shampoo leaving my hair smooth, silky, and very soft helping my hair to grow healthier and thicker.</li>
    <li> Amazing product for hair growth.  You can feel it working it&#x27;s very powerful and we have to be careful when rinsing not to allow the product to go into to the face  because it burns.  This is no cheap stuff this is the real deal for hair growth!  I have been using this product just for five days along with the shampoo and my hair is growing wild!!</li>
    <li> I have grown tremendously in respect for Ultrax Labs; they really seem to know what they are doing. They have won awards for their research and resulting hair products, and it shows. First off, this conditioner works! It does everything a top notch conditioner should do, leaving hair moisturized and renewed. The shampoo works wonders in the realm of stopping hair loss and stimulating new growth, but adding the conditioner helps leave your hair with an impressive shine while feeling full and soft. The hair growth properties are only amplified when using the products together. I love the ingredients in this conditioner, they are natural, proven ways to improve hair quality: more than just chemicals here. Hair is really left feeling invigorated, which I chalk up to the caffeine. The best way to find out what the hype is about these products are to buy them and test them yourself. You will soon be recommending them to your friends.</li>
    <li> Showering is a happy part of my day now!&lt;br /&gt;I am 26 years old and i saw my hair was thinning, i started using ultrax labs hair products and ever since i have had GREAT success with them. this last product is one of the 3 i recommend! i have been using this conditioner with the shampoo for a month now and you can see the difference. I have seen a further decrease in the amount of hair I am shedding after a shower and throughout the day; it is thicker, stronger &amp; healthier. It gives a nice smell and after smoothing feel to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I see many people reviewing that it does not work but the key is to get the products as a whole. and for your own happiness it is worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;I combine this with another product of Ultrax Labs here it is i also recommend it 100%&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Ultrax-Blocking-Nutrient-Solubilized-Supplement/dp/B00BFFQMBA/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_product_top&lt;br /&gt;I have had great success with these it took me around a month and a half to start noticing the changes. and it feels great to be confidant about your hair again!</li>
    <li> Very nice effects and these are immediate.</li>
    <li> A great addition to the shampoo, makes my hair feel even better.</li>
    <li> The special ingredients should be enough to let you know its a great product,  works very well &amp; in a decent amount of time the price is a steal compared to name brand &amp; local stores. Perfect for growth &amp; strengthening your hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after experiencing some hair loss due to thyroid problems. I started taking biotin and evening primose oil that slowed/stopped the hair from falling out, but I was at a loss on what to do to help stimulate it to grow back. I had read other reviews and decided to try it out. It&#x27;s not an overnight process, hair growth takes time as we all know. But I could definitely see fine hairs sprouting up along my hair line within the first two weeks and I could feel a lift with my hair overall. The smell is pleasant (definitely a caffeine smell, like an energy drink but in a good way). It lasts a lot longer than I thought it would too considering the size of the bottle, you only need a small amount to get a good lather, so you don&#x27;t have to squeeze a whole lot on (I have just below shoulder length fine hair though so it depends on your own hair volume and length). At any rate I am pleased with the purchase and would recommend it to others who have the same problems.</li>
    <li> The ultrax line of products is the only thing that seems to help a receding hair line / balding crown area. I have tried products from bosley, nioxin and ds labs. Maybe its my specific genetics and hair type but I will continue using this for now. A bit pricey but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Ultrax Labs Hair Solace Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Conditioner for a couple of times when I felt its noticeable effects on my hair and hair growth. A gentle and throughout massaging of my hair and scalp every other day after shampoo is more than enough to keep it smooth and shiny. I think that the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo is an exceptional product by itself but a boost from the conditioner in the same line helps with the end result. I cannot see myself using any other conditioner other than Ultrax Labs Hair Solace Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the outcome of using both product by Ultrax Labs, my hair volume has increased and could be felt. Of course, at first it is rather hard to notice but soon enough when I ran my fingers through my hair, I saw less hair falling out on my hands afterward. I think that the scalp is much healthier, which supports my hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using the shampoo with its shampoo Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo. I wanted the best result and the only way to get it was to use the whole package.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works great.  It leaves your hair so soft and silky. It&#x27;s definitely revitalizing. My hair is more beautiful than ever.&lt;br /&gt;  It is definitely the perfect touch.&lt;br /&gt;The caffeine is actually a wonderful concept.  You can feel the effect when you apply the product.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is growing faster than ever. There are continuous results every time I use it I have more wonderful, beautiful hair.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Solace Stimulating Hair Loss and Hair Growth  Conditioner has many active ingredients that help to improve the conditions of tired and other wise falling out hair follicles. the main active ingredient Caffeine has shown to extend the life cycle of hair and i can say i&#x27;ve seen a difference vs not using this product. one of the other of many active ingredients of this conditioner \\&quot;Simmondsia\\&quot; which is a oil made from a seed found in china it acts as a Powerful scalp cleanser that helps alleviate buildup that may impede normal hair growth.</li>
    <li> Smells great, leaves my hair feeling soft and fuller. I definately dont see the shedding from my hair that I usually see. If it works this good, I cant wait to see what it has done for me atfer a few months. Plus its made in the United States.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used the entire bottle yet, so its too soon to report if it is effective. Extremely inconvenient that the conditioner is so thick you can&#x27;t get it out of the bottle. I&#x27;ll try another product on my next purchase.</li>
    <li> My hair has begun to thin a bit in recent years. This conditioner definitely provides a fresh tingle, which improves circulation to promote a healthy scalp and new hair growth. On top of that, it leaves my hair feeling so soft and silky. This conditioner is a win all around! I now use the entire line of Ultrax Labs hair products and I love the way they make my hair look and feel!</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo, so I thought for the full effect I should get the conditioner. Love the smell and leaves my hair silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Looking forward to using the conditioner on cold days when my hair lacks moisture and I’ll be blow drying straight. Hopefully, using both the conditioner and serum should add just the right amount of shine to my hair while adding the extra benefit of the caffeine stimulant.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It is as good as any conditioner I have used for moisturizing and and a light fluffy feeling to your hair. Plus the added bonus of helping treat hair loss. In just a few weeks I have noticed a huge improvement in new hair. I would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet</li>
    <li> This conditioner lives up to the description! The cost is a little more expensive, but the product is definitely worth the money. Both the conditioner and shampoo will give you good results.</li>
    <li> When I started using this product I was very curious about it because of the list of special ingredients. The consistency of the product is very nice and thick and goes on smoothly onto the hair. The conditioner is very moisturizing and you can tell it&#x27;s a good quality product just from how it looks and feels. I only left it in my hair for a minute or two and then rinsed it out. My hair was so much more manageable and less frizzy than it normally would after using other similar products. I could also very easily comb my hair right after the shower and had no tangles. The product is so moisturizing that I didn&#x27;t have to use nearly as much as I would with another conditioner. Another bonus was after a few weeks of using it my hair seemed thicker, fuller and less damaged. This product can seem to be a bit pricey for the size of the bottle but it ends up being around the same price as someone would spend on another cheaper conditioner because you don&#x27;t have to use much on your hair for it to do it&#x27;s job. It definitely is worth buying because of what&#x27;s inside the bottle.This is good stuff, I recommend this product for anyone who wants smoother, thicker and more manageable hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is a must have for any one looking to have gorgeous hair. At first I used the shampoo only, and it worked great. Now I added the conditioner, and my hair feels incredible. It is softer, and has a beautiful shine, the best part is, that I can see new growth coming in. Never in my wildest dreams did I think it would stop hair loss too. My husband also tried it and is amazed how much of a difference it makes, we are excited to have found something that truly works, and are spreading the word Ultrax Labs.</li>
    <li> Just like it&#x27;s shampoo, this conditioner WORKS! Works best if you use both!  Great size and great quantity ! Def. Recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner after using the Shampoo Brand for over a month. I was amazed to see the results I got and wanted to get the matching conditioner. This conditioner was quite moisturizing and it&#x27;s a good quality product where you can feel the difference. I love the fact that Ultrax Labs Hair Solace contains caffeinated compounds mixed with essential oils. The conditioner formula is concentrated so a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I simply left the conditioner on my head of hair for one to five minutes and rinsed it off. I have tried various other similar items to no avail. I possibly could in addition simply brush my head of hair and remove the tangles. The item is so moisturizing that I virtually had to use a small amount to get the job done. Yet another benefit has been soon after 2-3 weeks where head of hair looked thicker, less breakage and not a lot of strands came out anymore. It will be might be priced at purchasing because of what is considered inside package. This is good stuff, I would recommend this supplement for people who want to achieve, thicker plus much more controllable head of hair.</li>
    <li> If you want soft, shiny, manageable hair, start in the shower by using Hair Solace conditioner. It is good for men and women with different hair types and it is very helpful against hair lost. Hair Solace conditioner uses natural ingredients among them caffeine which promotes the strength  and health of your hair. It is a highly effective product for hair regrowth it revitalizes the scalp and enhances the follicular function. With no doubt the Hair Solace Conditioner leaves the hair silky smooth and in combination with the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge shampoo it can give unrivaled result. I definitely recommend this hair conditioner I will keep it handy in my shower. Great stuff!!!</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells so fresh and invigorating.  It&#x27;s really thick and clings to your hair.  And it&#x27;s tingly!  Such a treat.  Feels like one of those treatments you&#x27;d pay big bucks for at the salon.  And the ingredients are pretty impressive -- caffeine, eucalyptus, chamomile, peppermint, rosemary.  I read in Allure magazine that caffeine can speed up hair growth by 25%, which is why I bought this conditioner in the first place and it really does plump up your hair.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner, works great. Definately worth the price.</li>
    <li> Both me and my husband have been using the conditioner after we use the hair growth shampoo. I think my results have been better than his, but time will tell. His hair looks thicker than it used to, so that’s a big plus. He likes the smell of the conditioner, too. The hair growth doesn’t happen fast, but you don’t have to use a lot of the product, so it lasts a long time. The conditioner smells good and it helped control my frizzy hair. I can see some visible new hair growth, so I will continue to use both products. Not cheap – but thick hair is worth it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like this product. I mixed with other shampoo and conditioner because of the lather (otherwise you have to use twice as much) for me I had a lot of hair falling out in the shower.did not see new growth</li>
    <li> This conditioner works great. It leaves my hair shinny, silky smooth, thicker and smelling great!  The combination of Eucalyptus and Chamomile helps strengthen the hair at the root allowing it to grow, and grow strong! My hair doesn&#x27;t shed as much as it used to and it&#x27;s a lot fuller.  My hair has never been better! I love, love, love this conditioner.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I have been using it for more than a week now and love what it is doing to my hair. It smells lovely as well! It has made my hair softer and it feels thicker as well. It has helped with the split ends and breakage as well. Definitely give this product a shot!</li>
    <li> i paired this conditioner with ultrax shampoo for my daily use, to speed up my hair regrowth due to my surgery, after few days of use the results are amazing.. my surgery scar has covered it and not noticeable anymore.. i would definitley recommend this product for anyone trying to regrow there hair!!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is great, especially when it is used with the shampoo.  I recommend both of these products.</li>
    <li> I love how this conditioner makes my hair feel. It leaves it nice and soft. Its worth the price. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing it again</li>
    <li> Best hair regrowth product anywhere. It lasts a long time. I&#x27;m at three months with religious daily use.</li>
    <li> My first impression was, darn, the bottle is so tiny.  8 oz is actually not that much and was so darn expensive for something that may or may not work.  Might as well just buy some cheap 99 cent shampoo and add some dissolved caffeine pills to it.  Probably would work better and you would only have to spend a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> I went through a rapid weight loss recently and one of the biggest draw backs is my hair thinned out a lot. I tried a lot of different shampoos, vitamins and natural remedies but nothing has seemed to work other this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only shampoo every other day, so It was nice to find a hair loss product that works in conditioner too.  After the first month I noticed a little more volume and the ingredients make your hair so soft and shiny!  I dont see as much hair falling out in the shower or in my brush now.  Since using this brand for over 2 months, It feels like my hair has way more volume and strength. My confidence must be shining through because I&#x27;ve even been getting compliments from my husband and co-workers on good hair days! I think the smell was good too. This is a quality product and I am really satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> If you want great healthy strong fast growing hair then this is the product to use. For best results I&#x27;ve been using with the Ultrax Labs shampoo and Ultrax Labs Hair Lush. I highly recommend these products as they have worked wonders for me and they actually work. I had thinning hair. My hair was constantly falling out. I&#x27;m so thankful and happy to say I no longer have those issues since using these great products. Another 5 stars for me! :)</li>
    <li> The consistency is smooth and rich.&lt;br /&gt;Although the bottle seems small for the price, It&#x27;s much more concentrated then other products so you can apply much less per use.  Apply the conditioner well on your hair and scalp, keep it for 2/3 minutes for best results.  The Caffeine ingredient gives a fresh burst to your hair.</li>
    <li> I tried for two months. I was fooled by fake reviews. even bought the vitamins for two months!</li>
    <li> Mmmmm. I like the way this makes my hair feel and look. My hair is nice and thick now. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> This complete product line is wonderful. It&#x27;s actually true to what it states it can do for your hair.  Yes, we know that the products are expensive, but I rather pay for something that I know works than something that promises you something and at the end can&#x27;t follow through.  I have not been disappointed with any of their products and have seen wonderful changes to my thinning, weak and lifeless hair.  My hair is full, longer and lustrous now compared to how it looked a few weeks ago.  My hair is a lot stronger, thicker and longer.  It&#x27;s shine and volume is coming back.  I love it.  If you really want a product for problematic hair, please give this product a try and see results quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! I use it along with the shampoo and am so pleased with my results. Not only does my hair look shiny, healthier, and thicker, but it feels that way. I let the conditioner sit on scalp and hair for about 10-15 mins while  I go around my home tidying up a few area, just to give a bit more time on my scalp. I love how my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch any longer and appears to be healthy, and that it doesn&#x27;t take much for each application. I have had it for a few weeks only, but I am so pleased that I am telling everyone about it when I get compliments.</li>
    <li> Besides this product living up to its claims, my favorite bit(s) are how much you get (I was worried upon opening that it would not last long; it does, you need only use a dime size amount) as well as the scent (I wish it were a candle too!). This was my first time using something like this for my hair (caffeine based) and I was a bit wary at first but eventually, it grew on me (pun intended). No need to research by reading through long forums or deciding to make your own remedies; save yourself the energy and buy this. It works, period!</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Solace is the real deal! This conditioner really enhances overall the quantity of your hair by thickening your hair, slowing down the hair loss process, putting essential oils and caffeine back into your hair follicles. This is a great way to recover from hair loss or thin hair. By using the Solace conditioner by Ultrax Labs, you can not go wrong with this purchase for those who are looking to revitalize/fix your hair problems. With a mix of essential oils and caffeine, this conditioner really gives your hair what it needs to be restructured correctly. This product works really well with the Ultrax Labs shampoo too giving your hair an even better feel and look when combined! When looking for a product to truly help the condition of your hair in a positive way, this Ultrax Labs Solace conditioner is what you should buy, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I wish I would have known about it sooner. I can&#x27;t imagine my life without it! My hair is in love with it,  it has a wonderful smell and keeps my hair soft!</li>
    <li> The Ultrax Lab Hair Solace Caffeine Hair Loss Growth stimulant conditioner is so good for my hair staying healthy and strong.  My hair is thicker and fuller and shinier after each use and I also use the shampoo as well by Ultrax Hair Shampoo caffeine hair growth.  The conditioner makes my hair feel look and feel much better after each use. I recommend it to all people who have thinning hair and want their hair to grow back fuller and healthier.</li>
    <li> good conditioner to use with the ultrax shampoo. I bought it as combo set and my hair came back to life with more volume. I have seen less hair in the drain as well.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the product. It didn&#x27;t do anything for me unfortunately. For such I high prove I expected better results. Also I didn&#x27;t enjoy the smell.</li>
    <li> I read many people complaining about the price of this conditioner.  A little goes a LONG way.  The conditioner feels great on the scalp!  A soft tingle, but not overwhelming.  The conditioner smells nice, not strong like medicinal hair growth formula conditioners.  I look forward to seeing how my hair has grown in 3 months.  So far so good!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Works perfectly with the Ultrax shampoo.  It keeps my hair soft and fills in the gaps to make it fuller.</li>
    <li> Very small bottle.  Conditional smells good but would not buy it again for the price</li>
    <li> Great compliment to the shampoo and hair serum I purchased before. You do have to wash your hair 5 times a week but it&#x27;s worth it if you want results.</li>
    <li> I tried this conditioner because I have thinning hair. My hair sheds a lot making my hair look thin and lifeless. After trying this conditioner, my hair felt stronger and thicker and I noticed I was shedding less. The conditioner moisturized my hair making it feel softer to the touch and more manageable. My hair looks healthy again and has lots of body and not limp anymore.  My hair is growing back lush and much thicker.</li>
    <li> I have been super impressed by Ultrax Labs hair products and thought I would try the Hair Solace Hair Loss conditioner. It has left my hair thicker, softer and fuller. This has been a great remedy for some of the hair loss I was experiencing. People at work have noticed my hair looks fuller. My neighbor even thought I was getting hair transplant treatment, which I am not. I highly recommend this conditioner for anyone experiencing hair loss. You will see the difference. It works!</li>
    <li> Smells good and makes my hair feel amazing. Softer and definitely thicker hair since I have started using this. Well worth every penny, and again can&#x27;t beat Made in USA.</li>
    <li> Great product!goes great with hair surge stimulating shampoo! Strongly recommended</li>
    <li> This conditioner is really effective; it&#x27;s light and smells great. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot at once and I have really noticed the results in the growth and strength of my hair.</li>
    <li> This is totally worth the good reviews. My shedding has decreased to almost nothing. There is a noticeable difference in the quality of my hair. It is just shinier, healthier, and fuller looking. I have tried so many different products and the results with ultrax surpasses anything else! Definitely give it a try!</li>
    <li> OK, OK, my mom needed this desperately, and it works. Too bad the price makes it unaffordable for the older ladies who could really benefit from it.</li>
    <li> My hair is so beautiful now. It gave my hair such great texture. I love this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I was a little leery when I first bought it but I cannot tell you how impressed I am. My hair is soft, shiny and I have like  95% less hair loss! It also has a nice fresh scent that I get complimented on.</li>
    <li> I pair this conditioner up with my regular shampoo and the results are amazing. First of all, it smells great! my hair is so smooth when I get out of the shower and I only leave the conditioner in for about 3 minutes when I am in the shower. My brush goes through my hair without a problem and I don&#x27;t have any knots. This really helps with the hair loss problem because I usually lose so much hair while brushing. I have been using it for about a week and a half and I cannot wait to see what the rest of the bottle has in store because already I am so excited about the results!!</li>
    <li> I have since an increase in thickness</li>
    <li> When I first purchased these products, I did so because my hair was not growing. I wasn&#x27;t losing any, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to grow at all. I was taking supplements that seemed fairly ineffective. I began using the shampoo first and had very good results. This conditioner is excellent. My hair is looking great. It is no more expensive than any other high level salon product. It glides through my hair and I only need to use a very small amount. My usual shampoo was always two bottles of conditioner to one bottle of shampoo. With this product is a 1:1 ratio. I like that. My hair is thicker, longer, shinier, and silkier than it has been in years - did I mention longer? It has grown noticeably and I am very happy!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Of course I tried a little on my hand to test it.But it turned out great! My hair is soo soft I didnt even know my hair could feel like this.The smell is awesome. When my bf hugs me he likes to smell my hsir .I definitely will be buying this again</li>
    <li> What a great product! Smells great to.  Have your head tingling</li>
    <li> Very good! Has a nice smell do recommend for others to use! I will buy more eventually when this one runs out! Wont disappoint you as it hasn&#x27;t disappointed me!</li>
    <li> This hair conditioner is truly wonderful. After just one use my hair was left silky smooth and I was able to untangle it so easily. Even after rinsing it out my hair felt very hydrated and had a beautiful shine to it. Another thing about it is that it smells amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and my hair definitely feels fuller. I give this conditioner 5/5 stars.</li>
    <li> After discovering Ultrax Labs products, my dad is slowly gathering the entire collection. Since adding the conditioner to his routine, his hair has been growing in thicker and smoother than ever before. He easily looks 10 years younger with his new head of hair! We had looked up tons of different products online, and he had even tried a few of them, but nothing has the great reviews and results that this does. Even with the winter months causing havoc and making my own hair brittle, his is luxuriously soft and full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for a week and was extremely surprised when my hair started feeling like I&#x27;d spent the day in a salon! Best of all, the breakage almost completely stopped, even with the sharp decline in temperature. There&#x27;s no denying it works! Ultrax Labs has gained two new life-long customers.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a while now, and i wouldn&#x27;t recommend anything else!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect conditioner for the matching shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using both now for a while and have seen amazing results. My hair has never been healthier, and the growth has defnintely increased. I&#x27;m almost out of this, and I will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t purchase it. Read the ingredients everything a HEALTHY shampoo and conditioner shouldn&#x27;t contain. Save up your cash for something better.</li>
    <li> Is it fair to use the word delicious? the fragrance makes me want to whip it up in the blender into a smoothie lol. Rich botanical conditioners penetrate my hair and leave it soft fresh smelling and shiny absolutely love this product. Another hands down winner!</li>
    <li> I am now a believer..this line of products are the true deal!!! I&#x27;m definitely noticing difference in my hair..well worth the money..</li>
    <li> Great product I have been using this product along with the Ultrax Labs Hair Shampoo and have found some amazing results.  My hair has stopped falling out entirely and my hair thickness is fantastic.  The conditioner makes my hair not only thicker but it also feels soft.  I cant believe it but I dont have any split ends or any frizzy hair.  I will def continue to purchase this product in the future.</li>
    <li> This product is a truly amazing Breakthrough ,itself has the properties to enhance the blood flow into the hair follicles ,making an stronger  &amp; shinny hair ,so far I&#x27;ve experienced the effects of this product by increasing the density of my bald spot located at the crown area ,which Im combining with the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo which I bought recently ,enhancing the features of this combo ,if used simultaneously ,no regrets ,money well invested on myself,it is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this! This is such a great thick and creamy conditioner that left my hair feeling nurtured, thick, and full. No more shedding, and instead I&#x27;m left with shiny gorgeous and most importantly, healthy hair. Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better solution to my shedding.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had hair problems for quite some time. There has been some misses and some hits, and this conditioner has been great. I&#x27;m very picky with my hair and it leaves my hair incredibly soft.  Right now, this is the only conditioner I own and will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> So far it is very good.</li>
    <li> I have been trying this product for a bit now, and I&#x27;m enjoying what I&#x27;m seeing so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is feeling fuller right now, and when I&#x27;m done using the product my hair is left feeling really soft which I enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been getting compliments from friends who have asked what I have been doing differently.  No I did not get a haircut, but thanks for asking.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this conditioner!  It really does work.  The caffeine seems to be helping perk up my follicles...and that means less hair loss and new growth.  The conditioner has a nice smell - not too overpowering, certainly not too feminine or masculine.  I also like that the conditioner contains Eucalyptus because this is supposed to make the hair root stronger and more elastic.  I also like the Chamomile because it seems to soothe my scalp.  A happy scalp means more hair, I think.  Also, the conditioner is not heavy and greasy.  I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Great, I recently bought the Ultrax Labs Hair Solace caffeine conditioner as well as buying the Hair Surge caffeine shampoo. I bought these items because I started to get concerned about my hair falling out when showering. The Ultrax Labs Hair Solace Conditioner has been wonderul!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product regularly, so I would wash my hair with the shampoo I had used regularly combined with Ultrax Labs conditioner. I wanted to try and get more hair volume and stop my receding hairline. Fortunately, now Hair Solace caffeine conditioner leaves my hair feeling very smooth, strong, and overall much better. Now, no more hair has been falling out after using this product. I feel wonderful and confident. I&#x27;m glad I gave Ultrax Labs a shot.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t judge as shortly after purchasing, was dx with Lupus which was causing the thinning. I will say that I would have nothing to do with  Ultrax Laboratories.  I called them since they made the product, and it was filled by them.  They advertise their guarantee but they would do nothing!  Amazon did come through for me &amp; I returned it to them.  In the meantime a big thank you to Amazon and a thumbs down to Ultrax Laboratories.</li>
    <li> I must admit, I was skeptical at first. As a former hairstylist, I am VERY particular about what hair care products I use. I must say, this is one of the best values for what it does that I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought that I would purchase a product designed to help grow hair. As I am now in my 30’s, I have noticed that my hair is not rebounding as well from the daily abuse I put it through. I have naturally curly hair, and like many I regularly straighten it. Not only have I noticed increasing breakage, but the little baby hairs no longer seem to ever grow. As I am not willing to admit my age in person yet, I wanted to find something that would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m using this in conjunction with the Hair Surge shampoo, and am very pleased with both. I was very pleased the first time I used the product. I have tried a couple other salon brand products, but they seemed to always leave my hair either very dry or very oily. Not only did I feel my hair was incredibly clean, it felt good! I noticed an immediate difference in the amount of breakage I was finding, and those little baby hair actually seem to be getting longer, time will tell. Best part, in my mind, I’m noticing less frizz then normal on those days that my hair just won’t behave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the conditioner itself, it has a very pleasant smell, but not overpowering. Very minty and fresh. Unlike similar products, I do not smell it all day, and no one else seems to be able to smell it. The consistency is nice and thick. There is a really nice cool tingly feel, which I very much enjoy. Overall, a great product!</li>
    <li> Product seems pretty decent but packaging was horrible. The conditioner arrived with the top sprung open and a mess in the bag.</li>
    <li> Fantastic conditioner!  First, I was surprised at how wonderful it smelt with no strong odor. It&#x27;s a good idea to massage into the scalp to stimulate hair growth and you can actually feel the caffeine tingle the head.  After using, I feel my hair has much less frizz and does not break as easily. I does not weigh my hair down but leaves it feeling full and silky.  A little goes a long way with this product so the bottle will last a while.  This conditioner works perfectly with Ultrax Labs Hair Surge.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for stimulating hair growth through the Ultrax Lab Hair product combination. Caffeine has been show to not only reduce hair loss but also stimulate growth. The other ingredients, Eucalyptus, Chamomile and Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil, all help keep the scalp clean while alleviating any irritation. I highly recommend this product for success.</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with this product. It leaves my hair so soft and so easy to brush out! I have very long hair and its always a pain to brush it after I wash it but this product leaves my hair so silky and manageable. It also gives my hair volume and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling heavy. Using it in conjunction with other Ultrax Hair products has done wonders for my hair. My hair feels thicker and theres almost absolutely no more hair loss.</li>
    <li> I really liked the idea of a new ingredient to promote hair growth but this smells like car wax.</li>
    <li> This conditioner just like the shampoo smells delish.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your hair smelling great,looking shiny and feeling soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;It even makes the texture of your hair feel fuller .&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!!!!!Great Price!!!</li>
    <li> I have another hair product from this brand so I thought I would give this a try and I&#x27;m glad I did! It&#x27;s a great conditioner my hair is visibly fuller and super soft. I&#x27;vew also noticed that my hair is stronger and doesn&#x27;t shed as much. I think this conditioner would be great for those with thin hair or that sheds a lot</li>
    <li> What a wonderful complement to the shampoo product by Hair Surge. I am glad to see Amazon&lt;br /&gt;selling this it is less expensive that way.  It leaves my hair soft and it definitely is full of more hair.</li>
    <li> Good stuff!  Gifted it to a happy camper!</li>
    <li> I use this product with my Ultrax Labs Hair Solace shampoo and love the combo. Unlike other hair stimulating products, this smells great and does not leave my hair oily or bogged down. Since using this product, I&#x27;ve noticed my hair appears thicker and stronger. I highly recommend the combo of this conditioner and their shampoo.</li>
    <li> Excellent conditioner! My grandad seems to love it!</li>
    <li> I have to say that I have been really impressed with the Ultrax Labs products.  This conditioner makes my hair really soft and silky.  I have been using the Hair Surge shampoo also and together they work wonders!  The shampoo is a really great stimulator and dirt stripper, and this conditioner makes your hair soft and manageable.  Not only has my hair been looking better, it FEELS better too, not just the texture, but the thickness as well.  I know it is helping with my thinning hair because there just plain isn&#x27;t as much hair in the drain everyday!  What I like most about this conditioner is that it contains a lot of natural oils.  It has: Aloe Oil, Lavender Oil, Jojoba Oil, Chamomile Oil, Rosemary Oil, Eucalyptus and Peppermint Oils.  And of course the active ingredients and the Caffeine.  That&#x27;s a lot of good ingredients for a conditioner!  I was impressed it had that many natural oils in it.&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is slightly less expensive than the shampoo.  I believe it&#x27;s 100% worth the price!  Wish it was a little bigger, but they say dynamite comes in small packages right!  My hair has never looked better....seriously!</li>
    <li> Great for regrowth of hair! Even if you are lucky enough to not experience hair loss, this conditioner helps counteract hair loss! Great for everyone</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product with the shampoo and lush treatment, and I really think my hair is looking healthy, not sure yet about the regrowth, but so far I like the overall appearance of my hair.  I have curly hair, and it can be a pain at times, and after using these products, it seems easier to manage.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t worked at all. I used it with the shampoo for hair thinning issues. Saw no change at all.</li>
    <li> The conditioner works will with shampoo. I love the way the conditioner smells. For the week I wash my hair for five days. But after week I wash my hair twice a week. I have positive and wonderful results. My hair has more manageable. My edges grown back.&lt;br /&gt;Less shedding. My hair is much thicker, fuller, and softer. I am seeing new hair growth.I had no tangles and it is easy to come through hair.The when was the conditioner out of my and blow dry no frizz at all. It is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I have discovered the Ultrax Labs line and especially the Solace conditioner. My hair has been noticeably thicker and has completely stopped falling out in the shower and this conditioner is keeping it healthy and strong in a way I haven&#x27;t experienced in many years. The conditioner smells amazing and lathers very smoothly, really penetrating the hair and the results are obvious. When my hair dries, it has a sheen and bounce to it that I have never experienced from another product. I am totally hooked and grateful to have found this gem!</li>
    <li> I read the review and was hoping for success! I started using it and after a little over a week the hair on front is falling out incredibly fast! How do I know? Number one I can see it and number two the amount of hair in my shower drain has NEVER been more!&lt;br /&gt;With a crazy cold winter I am feeling a draft on my head. This is the ONLY change I have made over the past weeks since using it!&lt;br /&gt;The label says NOTHING about helping to keep you from losing hair or hair regrowth. The label and the description don&#x27;t match!</li>
    <li> Buyer beware… this is an 8 fluid ounce bottle. 8 fluid ounces! That is less than half the size of your typical bottle of water. For all the claims this product makes, this is so ridiculously expensive. If you condition your hair once per day and use an &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; amount of this product, this is easily less than a one month supply. I have not encountered any conditioner on the market that is near this expensive per fluid ounce. For the annual cost of using this product in tandem with the shampoo, I am much better putting it towards professional hair restoration.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner!!! I leaves my hair soft and smooth and dont have to worry about untangling my hair afterwords. I have curly hair and that is a big +!!! I recommend it to everyone I know!!!</li>
    <li> The conditioner smells great and I love the tingling feeling from the peppermint oil.  It leaves my hair soft and I have noticed my hair feeling thicker already!</li>
    <li> After trying many hair loss shampoo/conditioner combos I like ultrax set the best.  My shedding has stopped completely and hair loss under control. Both of their products feel great on my hair and I love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still like to see more regrowth but time will tell if that&#x27;ll happen.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works great when used with the Ultrax Labs Shampoo. It&#x27;s one of the best 1-2 shampoo conditioner punches that I&#x27;ve used, and leaves the hair feeling full and extremely soft after every use. Usually my shampoos and conditioners give me dandruff due to a sensitive scalp, but this formula always leaves my scalp feeling great and revitalized.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Ultrax Labs Hair Solace caffeine conditioner along with the Hair Surge caffeine shampoo because I started to worry about my hair coming out when showering. Both of these products have been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every other day, I would wash my hair with my usual shampoo and noticed some hair strands in my hand after lathering. Some in my family have receding hairlines so I was worried my hair was starting to go back. I keep my hair fairly short so it would be noticeable if my hair recedes. After a couple weeks of still finding hair with my regular shampoo I decided to try the Ultrax Lab caffeine shampoo and conditioner. I am glad I chose these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hair Solace caffeine conditioner leaves my hair feeling very smooth, strong, and best of all no more hair has been falling out after a few days of use. I&#x27;m no longer worried about showering and am confident about my hair. I feel great. I&#x27;m glad I gave the Hair Surge Caffeine Shampoo and Hair Solace conditioner from Ultrax Labs a shot.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Ultrax Surge Shampoo to help regrow and strengthen my hair and liked it a lot so it;s a wonder why I didn&#x27;t think  about getting the conditioner at that time too. I&#x27;m glad I did because it compliments the shampoo great and does a good job conditioning my hair. The product itself comes out of the bottle thicker than the shampoo as one might expect, the smell isn&#x27;t super yummy like some of the other Herbal Essence products but its not a bad smell either and it doesn&#x27;t linger in your hair after you&#x27;ve washed it out. Same tingle sensation as the shampoo and my hair is literally feeling like it has a bounce or volume in it from the caffeine.</li>
    <li> Again another amazing product this works amazing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is shining growing to the fullest I would definately suggest this product to friends and family&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are amazing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product definately</li>
    <li> So far i can tell baby hairs coming back in ...&lt;br /&gt;Only been using it about 3 weeks</li>
    <li> The best thing about this product is that you don&#x27;t need globs of it. I simply apply it for a few minutes and as soon as I rinse I feel more volume. It&#x27;s an instant feeling of satisfaction and I&#x27;ve already mentioned the brand to a few friends. My hair is very greasy and not many products leave my hair feeling light and manageable. I workout three times a week and being able to have such an easy way to treat my thinning hair is actual helping my self-esteem. Experiencing new growth every week has made me feel stronger as a woman period.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now. I leave it on for 3-5 minutes and really rub it into both the roots (for hair growth) and the tips (for extra conditioning). I like that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or leave residue on my hair. I have medium-long hair and only wash every other day to avoid excess hair fallout so the price was fair for the amount of product I use. Since using this product, I noticed that my hair is silky and smooth with little fallout. My hair feels fuller and is softer. It doesn&#x27;t look damaged and is starting to look healthy and full, which is what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Living in the desert, I&#x27;m no stranger to dry hair. Most summers I can almost see the split ends forming as soon as I step outside. That is why I&#x27;m so glad to have found this conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I began using it, my hair has been healthier, shinier, and better looking than ever before. The conditioner has a great consistency and easily rinses out, leaving my hair nourished, but not greasy. I&#x27;ve been nothing but impressed and have suggested it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner! My hair was so much stronger feeling while still extremely soft and also very shiny after just two uses! My hair is so healthy looking, I don&#x27;t think i will ever back to regular drug store conditioner again! There has been a drastic difference in hair loss since I started using this product, my hair has grown in length, and I love the way this product leaves my hair smelling! The conditioner is thick so not much is needed, and one bottle can easily last 6 weeks. I love Ultrax products!</li>
    <li> I just had a baby so my hair was falling out like crazy. I tired this product and I think it has made a substantial difference. I see less hair in my bathtub and it feels great &amp; so soft afterward. I will continue using it even after my hormones are back to normal!</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo in my bath and use it twice a week and it is perfect for use it</li>
    <li> I am getting  lots of comments about my hair looking healthy.  I am very pleased with the new fullness of my hair. This product does all that it has been advertised to do. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results I&#x27;m getting.</li>
    <li> Really Good conditioner. Hair is soft to the touch after using as well as silky and great shine.</li>
    <li> I started using the shampoo about a month ago and loved it so I thought I&#x27;d add the conditioner to my routine as well. So far so good. I&#x27;m really happy with the results, I&#x27;ve noticed thickening and new hair growth which makes me very happy.</li>
    <li> This conditioner makes my hair so soft ever since I started using my hair is much fuller I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> My husband has not noticed any changes after using six months or more?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Ultrax Labs Hair Solace Shampoo and the Ultrax Labs Hair Solace Conditioner is a great compliment used together makes my hair thicker, fuller and has a great shine.  I love it and would recommend this to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft yet, with more body and, as with the shampoo, there is a definite tingling sensation on the scalp indicating something is at work.  Make sure the product is massaged into the scalp and allowed to sit for 2 minutes or more for the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is certainly worth a try to help those of us with hair loss ...</li>
    <li> I liked this product very much! I like how silky and smooth the texture is and how clean it leaves your hair feeling. Not to mention, it&#x27;s providing key nutrients for healthier hair. I would much rather use this on my hair than a cheap sulfate shampoo.</li>
    <li> What a shock when my wife received product.  Buyer be warned.  Only 8 oz. for $40.00!  Size of container is not posted on website.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product along with the shampoo and I am in love ! The conditioner leaves my hair extremely silky smoothe, and I have noticed a huge difference in the thickness of my hair ! Since using this product I am now able to put my hair up into a hair tie when I wasn&#x27;t able to before ! I use this conditioner every day and I have noticed my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy either as it does with other conditioners. I would recommend this product to every person who is experiencing hair loss !!!!!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes that this product could bring my hair back to the thicker, softer hair I had before it started falling out due to stress. I am glad I bought it because after a short time I notice less hair in my brush and more hair on my head. I wad skeptical at first but after reading reviews and doing some investigating decided to go for it and I&#x27;m glad I did.  No regrets here.</li>
    <li> I have used other products by Ultrax Labs they continue to amaze me.  This one helps with my hair growth too, it  adds a shine and strength to my hair they was not previously was there before.  It is complementary to their Hair Growth stimulating shampoo.</li>
    <li> Very bad toxic garbage. Don&#x27;t go near this stuff get a good organic product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my father, together with Ultrax shampoo and Ultrax supplement pills and the results have been phenomenal. This is the most effective conditioners that he has used so far. It is easy to use and it has reduced his hairloss and he  no longer losses his hair like he used to and most of his hair that he had lost has started to regrown. For the period of time that he has used this conditioner he has not experienced any negative effects. This is a must buy.product for those who have to live with hair loss problems or dry hair</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with the conditioner, it left my hair shiny, soft and fuller. I also like that it is an all natural product with a pleasant smell. I have recommended it to some of my friends.</li>
    <li> I would like to say that this conditioner is definitely worth it especially with the shampoo, I love how afterwards my hair feels light &amp; not weighed down. I&#x27;m surprised that I haven&#x27;t seen it in stores, I love that I can actually style my hair how I&#x27;v always wanted to because of this product,  I&#x27;m so happy that I&#x27;m getting the results I wanted &amp; not getting jipped out of my money. Would definitely recommend this awesome secret combo^_^</li>
    <li> This goes great with the other products like the shampoo not only does it smell great and leave your hair silky and soft it actually works I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and I&#x27;ve seen less shedding in the shower when I wash and also when I&#x27;m just brushing or combing my hair im very impressed!</li>
    <li> Great product especially when used with their caffeine shampoo. After about a week you will see results and they are wonderful. This conditioner has a great smell and will leave your hair manageable and healthier after the first time using it.</li>
    <li> I really love this conditioner. It leaves my hair so soft and shiny. It also plays extremely well with my oily hair. Love the smell and love the results. No more hair chunks in my drain.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to give this product a try. I had heard so many great things about it., but I was very skeptical. I gave it a try and started noticing a difference after a while. Ib swell be ordering another soon.</li>
    <li> Excellent complement to the shampoo... dense enough so it actualky stays in your hair while you shower instead of running down your back! Shipping was extremely quick and product delivered intact without defect! *****!!!!</li>
    <li> Does not work. Had greater hair fallout while using thus product. Contains mineral oil and propylene glycol which can be very unhealthy for some folks. Price is ridiculous.</li>
    <li> This stuff definitely works. I&#x27;ve been using it every other day for a little over a month now and I am already getting compliments about how healthy my hair looks. The other day my girlfriend (she doesn&#x27;t know I&#x27;m using this) told me that she noticed something different about me and she likes it and I have a suspicion it has to do with my hair ;) I have lost track of how many different products I have used over the years to try to halt my receding hairline and I really believe that my prayers have finally been answered :) Will update!</li>
    <li> So far this has been a Big disappointment! I have only used it twice and my hair was drier than before I used it. So expensive too!!!</li>
    <li> It is simply fantastic. I love the natural ingredients, it totally makes my scalp feel healthier. It makes my hair look, feel and smell amazing. My hair has been thinning and falling out for months, within a week of using this shampoo hair loss has almost completely stopped. Within 3 weeks I was no longer loosing my hair &amp; I have started to see new growth. I could not be happier with this &amp; I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Product is real good and helpful.... I couldnt believe the outcome. My hair just been do healthy and natural still</li>
    <li> Just got the product and i love it! Makes my hair feel soft and looks great! Recommend to all!</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. It&#x27;s easy to use first of all. I put it on right when I get into the shower and then wash, shave, brush my teeth...(yes I brush my teeth in the shower when I get up) And the last thing I do before getting out, is rinse my hair. I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave a bad smell, and my hair feels thicker. I wish I would have taken a before pic before starting this so I could compare, but I feel like it&#x27;s working well. Again, the ease is one of the best features. Use it once a day and you&#x27;re done. Love it.</li>
    <li> This thick, creamy conditioner feels like silk on my scalp. It moisturizes and detangles my hair leaving me with a headful of smooth, shiny silkiness. No more breakage and shedding.</li>
    <li> Great product, use it in combination with Surge shampoo.</li>
    <li> Got it in the mail and was a bit skeptic at first, but after using it for a good period of time, I definitely saw great improvements on my own hair. The word to describe it would be fuller. The product help give my hair a healthy, thicker and darker look. The product feels really natural just like every other hair product out there. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I started with just the Ultrax hair surge shampoo but it was a must to buy the conditioner too. Having both products made the results definitely more noticeable. Sometimes my scalp is dry and irritated but the chamomile helps soothe this and it smells very mild. I went to get a haircut last week,  and my stylist noticed a huge difference with my thicker head of hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner left my hair feeling soft, smooth with a great sheen.  As far as helping with my hair loss, this conditioner is fantastic at reducing the shedding and I found that maximum hair growth can be achieved if you really put the effort into massaging it into your scalp.  This results in increasing the blood flow to your scalp and growing more hair!  I also thought that this conditioner had a nice scent to it.  Definitely adding this product to my regular hair care routine.</li>
    <li> overpriced and not very effective</li>
    <li> I feel in love with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I use it  about every other day love it I use I a palm size in my hair for about 2 mints  then rinse it out. It makes my hair feel super soft ,I was surprised my hair is very thick and at times. It take me about 45 mints to my hair done now in the morning it take me 15 mints to do my hair hair soft n growing  long my hair looks healthy and strong. I will always buy this product love it...I was having promble with my hair not growing but it has started again I seen results within a week love it...im so happy my hair finally growing.</li>
    <li> Ultra labs hair solace is one of the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever tried.  My hair was instantly rejuvenated. This is a must have for my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> After using this product along with the Shampoo, I have to say that I have begun to see the differences. My hair really feels thicker and I am more confident to run my fingers through my hair without fear of losing some hair strands. It leaves my scalp feeling refreshed and when I step out of the shower, I can see my hair is shinier and it just feels healthier. One major thing I&#x27;ve noticed with this product is how much easier it has become to use my comb and actually comb in the style that I want because my hair has become more manageable. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I started using this conditioner in combination with the shampoo, and my hair has never been more gorgeous. And what&#x27;s even better is that my hair and scalp even feel better now. My scalp is usually both overly oily AND itchy, but after using this it just feels balanced. My hair is also super shiny and lustrous now.</li>
    <li> If you are unsure about this product don&#x27;t be! You WILL see immediate results. This conditioner is stimulating and allows hair to be silky smooth. After using it five times per week, you will see better, thicker hair growth. Do not be afraid of buying this conditioner! It&#x27;s so easy to use and 100% satisfaction is guaranteed so there is nothing to lose. The caffeine has strengthened my hair root and it works together with the organic ingredients to provide me with shinier hair. There are so many natural oils such as Chamomile oil, Rosemary Oil, Jojoba Oil, among others, which together allow for healthy scalp care. Massage the conditioner onto your scalp and hair, just let it be absorbed, you will not regret it. For the amount of change you will see with your hair, the price of this conditioner is EXCELLENT! Brace yourself for new health hair!</li>
    <li> I never thought my hair could look and feel this good. This product has changed my life and given me so much confidence! I use the Ultrax Hair Solace Caffeine Stimulating conditioner in conjuction with the Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo. I will never switch. My hair has gone from thin, limp and dry to beautifully full, healthy and soft! The stimulating ingredients plus essential oils have breathed new life into my hair. This conditioner is silky and smells amazing. I am using less hair products trying to achieve the desired result because this product is so effective. Gone are the days of being embarrassed by all the thinning and shedding. Thick, shiny hair is what you will have if you use this product. I highly recommend you try it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Such a great Product Line!</li>
    <li> Hair Solace from Ultra Labs is a pleasant-smelling, remarkably hydrating hair conditioner.  I believe it is formulated to complement the Hair Recovery shampoo, and it certainly does, at least from a shine and manageability standpoint (it’s still too soon for me to tell whether or not hair growth will be encouraged).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the product is thick, yet my hair feels lightweight and smooth upon drying.  In fact, I only use a small amount to tame the summertime frizzies.  The impressive moisturizing capabilities of this conditioner actually tempt me to try a little on my knees, feet, and elbows, as they always seem to appear dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knows, perhaps I will.</li>
    <li> Who knew caffeine and eucalyptus could stimulate hair growth! Ultrax Labs’ Hair Growth Stimulating Conditioner is unlike any conditioner I’ve ever used, and that’s a good thing! This conditioner has made my hair silky soft – something I never thought was possible! In addition, Ultrax Labs’ conditioner instantly made my hair feel healthier and thicker and continues to perform day after day. Get hair you can be proud of – choose Ultrax Labs’ Hair Growth Stimulating Conditioner!</li>
    <li> Stop being embarrassed by having to buy hair stimulating products from stores when you can have them shipped directly to your door. Arriving in an ordinary box, Ultrax Labs Hair Solace is ready to help re-stimulate your hair growth. Their Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Conditioner makes it possible. It is easy to use, has a light, not overpowering fragrance, and helped me get results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with the shampoo, it works at its best when used 5 times a week. It&#x27;s as simple as using in place of your regular conditioner. Keep it on 2-5 minutes and rinse. Don&#x27;t worry about missing out on your regular conditioner&#x27;s benefits either. This conditioner leaves your hair feeling just as soft and smooth. The only difference you will see is your hair becoming fuller. Try it out. And try it out with the shampoo while you&#x27;re at it. I have definitely noticed a difference around my hairline.</li>
    <li> I like the way it feels on my hair. Feels great and smells good. I had weight loss surgery last year and in the process of losing a lot of weight my hair started falling out in abundance (typical for WLS patients). I was told to try this product along with the \\&quot;Hair Surge\\&quot; shampoo. I&#x27;m 11 months out from surgery now and the hair loss has gone back to normal, everyday stuff. I&#x27;ve been using these two products for several months now and only wash my hair every other day. I only use a very small amount. The shampoo lathers up wonderfully and the conditioner is silky smooth. My hair has started growing again and filling in from being very thin. I have more volume now and visible new growth all over. Even though this is expensive, I&#x27;ll keep using it.  See comments below for specifics on my opinion of the new formula.</li>
    <li> Seems to work. Losing less hair. Hair stays clean for long time. Nice. I have to remember to put on the Hair Lush.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs has done it again! The Hair Solace Conditioner with caffeine is head and shoulders above any other products I have tried. The conditioner has a thick, creamy feel in the hand and a velvety smooth, light feel in the hair; not heavy and oily like so many thickening conditioners can be. My scalp is re-awakened, tingling as the caffeine is massaged into it. I have been using Hair Solace for two weeks now and my hair has never looked or felt healthier. My thin hair now has a fullness and shine I never knew possible.  The Hair Surge Shampoo, Hair Solace Conditioner and Hair Lush Thickening Treatment are the perfect trio for incredible hair. Thank you Ultrax Labs!</li>
    <li> This conditioner works do great!  I can feel the difference after one use. My hair feels softer and thicker, very luscious and sexy.  The conditioner is thick like it should be.  This company had not let me down yet I love them.  Definitely try this conditioner!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and I am in love with it! It is very easy on my hair and I like the smell of it as well. I use this together with their shampoo and I have notice a huge difference on the thinness and quality of the hair on my head. It definitely leaves my hair softer and more hydrated and fresh looking.</li>
    <li> This product works great, especially when paired with the shampoo. It softened and revitalized my hair after only a few washes, and my hair is now growing fuller than ever. My hair gets very unmanageable and frizzy during the warmer months, but this conditioner was able to tame it regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product not only because it works to soften my hair and promote growth, but also because the ingredients are safe and natural. I never like loading my hair down with chemicals, but I don&#x27;t have to feel like I&#x27;m doing that at all when using Ultrax&#x27;s conditioner. 5/5, really great product, and WORTH the cost.</li>
    <li> Great product, Very nice consistency of the conditioner. Goes great after using the Ultrax shampoo:) Saw results!</li>
    <li> I started using this product and I was kind of skeptical because of the list of special ingredients. It feels very nice and goes on smoothly onto the hair. You can tell it&#x27;s a good quality product just from how it feels and it also smells great. Surprisingly the results were instant after the first shower i took, where i noticed my hair was more manageable and softer.  The conditioner is so moisturizing that I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it to notice the results as I would with conditioner i have tried. This product seems a bit pricey for the size of the bottle but in reality you don’t have to use as much as other cheaper conditioners i have tried in the past because of the good quality of this product. I really enjoyed using this conditioner because of the immediate results in my hair so i would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for smoother, thicker and more manageable hair. As far as the hair growth that the product is promising  this shampoo is great for growth in the long run and can be increased if you spend some extra time massaging it into your scalp to increase blood flow and to really get it inside your body.</li>
    <li> I have noticed no difference and have been using this product for over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the results vary from person to person. I&#x27;m 26 and noticed my hair on top my head was thinning and wanted to see if I could thicken it back up and regrow some of the lost hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe results take a while, but over a month down the road I see no visible difference. Price is quite high too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this though, I really like the smell of it. To me it smells like an orange creamsicle. Again though, not worth it just for the smell.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product, and the way it left my hair feeling after use. My hair is fuller, and softer! It has more bounce as well. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase!!</li>
    <li> This product actually works! I&#x27;ve been meticulously searching and researching conditioners for my thinning hair. A job in itself. I came across Ultrax Labs Hair Solace Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Conditioner and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I was already trying out the shampoo. I didn&#x27;t think that a conditioner would be effective to helping my hair loss…BUT I have been using this conditioner for a little over one month now and I am amazed that it actually works! The caffeine is awesome and I can actually feel it tingling and working…I&#x27;m not kidding! It really seems that the conditioner in conjunction with the shampoo seem to be helping stop the amount of hair that I am/was losing. Hallelujah!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t purchase it . But people look at the reviews ! They are clearly written by the product team .</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t take a risk of buying it .&lt;br /&gt;I am not a reviewer person.. but this product made me to write my story :)&lt;br /&gt;I tried this conditioner along with Ultrax shampoo . As a conditioner, this is not made any benefits ...But rather tremendous hair loss. It didn&#x27;t make my hair moisturized, Frizz controller and of course not hair growth but hair loss..&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS BEFORE BUYING IT.&lt;br /&gt;note: I did try this shampoo and conditioner for 5 months without any better hair loss..</li>
    <li> Quality product! I&#x27;ve had noticeable issues with hair loss within the past year and have been experiencing great results since I began using this conditioner.  Not only is my hair softer and more nourished--I&#x27;ve seen new hair growth!  I am definitely pleased and would continue to get hair products from Ultrax.</li>
    <li> I am a senior man, early 60s, who thought his hair looked pretty good in spite of some recession. My big problem, I thought, was that my hair, being very fine, just lay flat and helmet like. I began using the shampoo first and within days people complimented me on how much fuller my hair looked. Now I have this conditioner and, again, with just a few uses, friends complimented me on how my hair looked even better and fuller still! Being curious, I looked into the ingredients and found that, indeed, they do promote healthy hair and growth. This product has a nice scent and I find it doesn&#x27;t take much after I&#x27;ve shampooed and rinsed my hair. My hair and scalp simply feel better too. I&#x27;ve also had some problems with scalp flaking and, frankly, since using both products...shampoo and this conditioner...it&#x27;s gone. So, I am happy to rate this conditioner a 5 star and am thankful to have been introduced to it. Oh, and, yes...I do see some new hair growth!</li>
    <li> Works great on my hair</li>
    <li> My hair stopped shedding after using.</li>
    <li> I would recommend Ultrax Labs Hair Conditioner as a great companion to their Hair Surge Shampoo. It&#x27;s too soon to know about regrowth, but other benefits are noticeable right away. I have battled frizz issues with other products, but the conditioner seems to make it much more manageable!</li>
    <li> I like this product. I usually combine it with the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge. My hair now looks soft and more beautiful than months ago, healthier. For me the only problem of this regrowth conditioner was how much it costs... 50 bucks is quite expensive, but i think now it&#x27;s 30$, much affordable.</li>
    <li> It tears the hair out of my head, with more tangles when I get out of the shower. There is no way to even get a comb through without painstaking tearing even more hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!</li>
    <li> Good hair conditioner for growth.</li>
    <li> Highly Effective Caffeine Hair Regrowth Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;I totally recomend it.  If you already have the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Shampoo use along with that.&lt;br /&gt;Your hair is soft and shining and really give yours hair a feeling that it is growing.&lt;br /&gt;No side affects and worth trying</li>
    <li> This did absolutely nothing for my hair and I am convinced it&#x27;s a scam. There were even mis-spellings on the back label.</li>
