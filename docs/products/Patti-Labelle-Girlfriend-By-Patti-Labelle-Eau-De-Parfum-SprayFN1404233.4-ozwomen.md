    <li> It is just what I expected and it arrived on time. I will recommend to others. There are many places I can order from but I prefer ordering through Amazon.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume now. It has a sour and bitter sexy at the end. Remains in my skin and dresses forever. After couple of hours the smell gets deeper which makes me to keep smelling my self or my dress. I love it ... It&#x27;s like jazz and blues smell</li>
    <li> This item has a sharp scent, I think it&#x27;s more for the younger crown than the original Patti perfume. I bought it for my aunt who&#x27;s 35 and she loves it....</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! My mother gave me one like this a few years ago but I wasn&#x27;t able to find this at any department store.</li>
    <li> The box looked as if it was crushed at some point.  It was an old bottle of fragrace.  Since you can not send back perfume, I hate to eat the cost and threw this crap in the trash.  Shame on you seller for selling an aged perfume.  Cheese and wine are good aged, not old stinky perfume.  Will never buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a christmas gift.  I did take a while for it to ship and when I got it the box had some wear and tear.  But overall, It was still great.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my mother for christmas and I know she is going to love it. This perfume smell sweet and powdery, and last atlease 6 hours, which is a plus. I think this scent is for a more mature person, great gift for your mom or a good girlfriend. It smells really good,good job patti and at a very affordable price. Don&#x27;t hesitate and get this perfume, you will not regret it, I give it 5 stars.</li>
