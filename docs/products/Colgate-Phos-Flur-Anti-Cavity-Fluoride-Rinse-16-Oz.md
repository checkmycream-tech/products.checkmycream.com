### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This products works wonderful for him.</li>
      <li>I am very happy and feel empowered that I have successfully averted dental problems with this routine.</li>
      <li>so I was happy to find it at Amazon.  </li>
      <li>and i will continue to use this until my braces come off in 2 years lol.</li>
      <li>All I know is that I have had a GREAT result.  </li>
      <li>Works great, but my daughter was not a fan of the flavor.</li>
      <li>This is a great product.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, the service was great</li>
      <li>Great for someone who has had cavities.</li>
      <li>The flouride rince is great for my oral problems but the taste leaves ALOT to be desired.</li>
      <li>Having braces makes me a million times more cavity prone than I already am, so this was the best choice for me, and I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
      <li>The product seems as good as the prescription equivalent but who knows.  </li>
      <li>To me it tastes good</li>
      <li>It is a good product to use when you have braces to protect your teeth.</li>
      <li>Being a prime member and having the free two day shipping is great.</li>
      <li>So, I found the phos-flur on Amazon and am thrilled.  </li>
      <li>I love the product for my teeth to prevent the decay and cavities and also the service provided by amazon was just swift and very satisfying.</li>
      <li>I think the product is great and it is certainly mild.</li>
      <li>and it was recommended to be a better value for the money, but</li>
      <li>It also does not do well in the mouthwash department, more mint would be better.</li>
      <li>teeth did seem to look better with use: The bottom edges of my top front teeth were a bit translucent before I started, but they became slightly more opaque over the course of a month.</li>
      <li>and I was quite satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m glad they sell it over the counter now.</li>
      <li>one time it was prescription but became over-the-counter many years ago.  </li>
      <li>Refreshing too.  </li>
      <li>My tooth enamel feels more like it should after using this.</li>
      <li>I have been using this mouth wash for more than 20-years.  </li>
      <li>the Colgate Phos-Flur tastes better.</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast, and the packaging was very nice for a liquid product.  </li>
      <li>Love this...and so easy...</li>
      <li>This stuff is good for preventing white spots while wearing braces, however it can not replace good oral hygiene.</li>
      <li>Great product and super fast service!</li>
      <li>Arrived in wonderful condition as expected.</li>
      <li>The taste is pretty good (I ordered the mint), and at 61 years old I am excited about anything that will help me keep my own teeth!</li>
      <li>stopping the excess fluoride my dizziness, which had gotten severe, went away as well as my fatigue, body aches and easy</li>
      <li>It is more economical to purchase from Amazon.</li>
      <li>My son&#x27;s dentist suggested this mouthwash, although he&#x27;s doing great on the generic ACT mouthwash.</li>
      <li>and it comes in different flavors, which makes it great for children.</li>
      <li>My mouth feels clean after using it.</li>
      <li>My dental check&#x3D;ups have improved from alarming to great.</li>
      <li>He especially likes the mint flavor, which is surprising.</li>
      <li>I also give this rinse to my two older children once a week before bed and try to keep their teeth healthy.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite mouthwash.</li>
      <li>I really haven&#x27;t found a product that is reasonably priced and works that tastes better.</li>
      <li>a physician and had cut out everything else I could think of without success but wasn&#x27;t aware of the dangers of fluoride toxicity</li>
      <li>I have neglected my own dentist&#x27;s visits because I&#x27;m spending so much on his braces and regular check ups.</li>
      <li>This brand works better than the regular drug store brand</li>
      <li>am trying to preserve the primary teeth I still have (I&#x27;m 34 years old)</li>
      <li>Product was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>This is my first fluoride rinse, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My husband and I like the taste, and we will certainly order again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m super sensitive to mint, but this I actually really like.</li>
      <li>Our modern diet is ready made for developing cavities, as we consume way too much sugar.  </li>
      <li>Not like others that sound like they do the same thing.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because it shouldn&#x27;t cost this much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve not bought the cheaper alternatives yet, so I can&#x27;t really make a comparison.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m really liking it.</li>
      <li>I had sensitivity in one tooth which I did not worry about too much.  </li>
      <li>these days when so many people drink carbonated beverages such as soda pop, topical fluoride rinses really help to remineralize the enamel damaged by the acids of soda pop.</li>
      <li>However when a second tooth became sensitive I figured it was time to pull out all available</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>My dentist highly recommends this mouth wash</li>
      <li>The price was a little higher, but taking time and gas into account, the price is fine.  </li>
      <li>you have a real cavity problem, or have a dry mouth, there are better more-concentrated prescription products such as Gel-Cam,</li>
      <li>It has a really nice, subtle taste and it&#x27;s so gentle.</li>
      <li>I am definitely going to order more Phos Flur products once these get exhausted :)</li>
      <li>I recently had 17 cavities filled and I am not going to have anymore; that&#x27;s final.</li>
      <li>We were so surprised when we got it 2 days after we ordered it.  </li>
      <li>I am a 65 year old who has issues with receding gums.</li>
      <li>(If you are not cavity-prone and have sound teeth then this product is probably a waste of money).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>At the very least, it is likely not to be too effective given how quickly the active ingredients react.</li>
      <li>Took about a year on the worse places at the gum line but for the most part...very comfortable in a few short months.  </li>
      <li>Since I moved to an area where water is not fluoridated, everyone at my family started having cavities, some of them for the firts time in their lifes.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I placed the next order from John Alexander Upperman through Amazon, and this order came in a different bottle, tasted different, and more importantly IT IS FROM A LOT THAT EXPIRED IN 2010!!!&lt;br /&gt;Being this a health product intended to be put in one&#x27;s mouth, selling a product that&#x27;s expired years ago is dangerously irresponsible.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really say if one of the above is the key or if I have achieved a synergy amongst the entire combination.  </li>
      <li>I am a dental professional and recommend this for my teen kids.</li>
      <li>and so far i havent seen any white marks on my teeth</li>
      <li>I think this was a little more expensive than the Crest, but I&#x27;m much happier with the quality.</li>

<li> This stuff is good at controlling bad breath and lasts a long time.</li>
<li> I have severe dental issues and long story short</li>
<li> My teeth are less sensitive.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m careful to use the smallest amount I need to swish.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s no surprise that a dentist would recommend the outrageously overpriced Colgate product, since the reason for the high price was to put more money into dentists&#x27; investment accounts.</li>
<li> /&gt;BE CAREFUL WITH FLUORIDES!</li>
<li> This usually happens at the gum line and results in a white line of decalcification that often times progresses to a breakdown of the tooth and a cavity.  </li>
<li> My ortho recommended this mouthwash to me because I am extremely cavity prone to matter</li>
<li> It carries the same seal of ADA approval as the expensive Colgate version and has the same concentration of fluoride.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used it for about a week and a half</li>
<li> hygienist told me that too much fluoride is dangerous (was also brushing twice a day with Clinipro) and she was right.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
<li> My daughter got braces a few months ago and received this rinse at the orthodontist&#x27;s office.  </li>
<li> I started just after radiation treatment for cancer that dried my mouth --- a condition that continues today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The sugars feed the bacteria in our mouths and they metabolize the sugar and give off waste products that contain acid.  </li>
<li> Also the taste is pretty bad.</li>
<li> She has had an expander for the past couple of weeks and this product was recommended by her dentist.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if the formulation changed over the years</li>
<li> , they are way past their expiration date but with this rinse, I can at least try.</li>
<li> /&gt;The typical sensitive-tooth toothpastes merely deaden pain.  </li>
<li> However, I am giving it 4 stars because the taste is pretty horrible.</li>
<li> Its insane that this costs so much.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure you could even get a kid to use it, its so bad.</li>
<li> but man is this stuff expensive.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product seems as good as the prescription equivalent but who knows.  Anyway, the service was great and I rec&#x27;d it 1 day!</li>
    <li> i been using this since i got my braces and so far i havent seen any white marks on my teeth so i guess its working well and i will continue to use this until my braces come off in 2 years lol.</li>
    <li> As a dentist, I recommend Phos Flur fluoride rinse for anyone who is cavity prone, and especially kids. Our modern diet is ready made for developing cavities, as we consume way too much sugar.  The sugars feed the bacteria in our mouths and they metabolize the sugar and give off waste products that contain acid.  It is these acids that etch the calcium and phosphorus out of teeth.  This usually happens at the gum line and results in a white line of decalcification that often times progresses to a breakdown of the tooth and a cavity.  (If you are not cavity-prone and have sound teeth then this product is probably a waste of money).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concentration of fluoride is relatively low at .044%, but it still helps enamel and tooth structure remineralize and strengthen. Used once a day as a rinse for 1-minute just before bedtime (and after brushing the teeth), it remineralized tooth enamel and root surfaces.  It is clinically proven to reduce the incidence of tooth decay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a real cavity problem, or have a dry mouth, there are better more-concentrated prescription products such as Gel-Cam, that your dentist or doctor can precribe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In these days when so many people drink carbonated beverages such as soda pop, topical fluoride rinses really help to remineralize the enamel damaged by the acids of soda pop. If you drink a lot of pop, and don&#x27;t intend to stop, then use this product - it may just help save your teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim \\&quot;Konedog\\&quot; Koenig, DDS</li>
    <li> I love the product for my teeth to prevent the decay and cavities and also the service provided by amazon was just swift and very satisfying. I am definitely going to order more Phos Flur products once these get exhausted :)</li>
    <li> Arrived in wonderful condition as expected.</li>
    <li> My son has braces and this product was recommended by his ortho.  This products works wonderful for him. It is more economical to purchase from Amazon. We have to get a script otherwise</li>
    <li> I ordered Phos-Flur about two months ago and I was quite satisfied with the product. Since I moved to an area where water is not fluoridated, everyone at my family started having cavities, some of them for the firts time in their lifes.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I placed the next order from John Alexander Upperman through Amazon, and this order came in a different bottle, tasted different, and more importantly IT IS FROM A LOT THAT EXPIRED IN 2010!!!&lt;br /&gt;Being this a health product intended to be put in one&#x27;s mouth, selling a product that&#x27;s expired years ago is dangerously irresponsible. I used it a couple times before noticing the expiration date, I hope it doesn&#x27;t have any adverse effects in my health. At the very least, it is likely not to be too effective given how quickly the active ingredients react.</li>
    <li> I am a 65 year old who has issues with receding gums. My dentist recommended daily bedtime use of the product. I have used it for 2 years. My dental check&#x3D;ups have improved from alarming to great.</li>
    <li> My ortho recommended this mouthwash to me because I am extremely cavity prone to matter how well I take care of my teeth. I recently had 17 cavities filled and I am not going to have anymore; that&#x27;s final. Having braces makes me a million times more cavity prone than I already am, so this was the best choice for me, and I&#x27;m really happy with it. It has a really nice, subtle taste and it&#x27;s so gentle. It prevents cavities and helps with enamel all while preventing white spots on the teeth.  Who WOULDN&#x27;T want this?</li>
    <li> I have been using fluoride rinses since I was about 10. It used to be you had to get a prescription back in the day. But I&#x27;m glad they sell it over the counter now. I have severe dental issues and long story short am trying to preserve the primary teeth I still have (I&#x27;m 34 years old), they are way past their expiration date but with this rinse, I can at least try. I also give this rinse to my two older children once a week before bed and try to keep their teeth healthy. It unfortunately does have that dentist fluoride taste IMHO is nasty. I really haven&#x27;t found a product that is reasonably priced and works that tastes better.</li>
    <li> My daughter left on travel for a couple of weeks.  She has had an expander for the past couple of weeks and this product was recommended by her dentist.  I purchased it the day before she left and it got to her location the day she arrived.  Being a prime member and having the free two day shipping is great.</li>
    <li> Actually gave me a prescription for it....  Not necessary...you can get it over the counter now...Took about a year on the worse places at the gum line but for the most part...very comfortable in a few short months.  I&#x27;m 62 and the cold air here would kill my teeth.  Love this...and so easy...Don&#x27;t swallow it...read the directions!!! It used to be prescribed!!!  Not like others that sound like they do the same thing.  This is the only one!!!  My Dentist hammered that part into me...</li>
    <li> I have the invisible bracers and I use this rinse daily. This brand works better than the regular drug store brand and it comes in different flavors, which makes it great for children. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My daughter got braces a few months ago and received this rinse at the orthodontist&#x27;s office.  When she ran out, I looked at several stores but could not find this brand.  So, we purchased the Crest total care for braces.  This seemed to turn her teeth brown, which I have heard can be an issue.  So, I found the phos-flur on Amazon and am thrilled.  The shipping was fast, and the packaging was very nice for a liquid product.  I think this was a little more expensive than the Crest, but I&#x27;m much happier with the quality.</li>
    <li> The flouride rince is great for my oral problems but the taste leaves ALOT to be desired. Please manufacturer work on that in lyour lab.</li>
    <li> Strengthens my teeth and gums, post-surgical recommendation and now I use it daily.  Great for someone who has had cavities.</li>
    <li> Works well and does strengthen teeth however can&#x27;t be used a lot then teeth can begin to get stained</li>
    <li> My dentist highly recommends this mouth wash</li>
    <li> I had sensitivity in one tooth which I did not worry about too much.  However when a second tooth became sensitive I figured it was time to pull out all available weapons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The typical sensitive-tooth toothpastes merely deaden pain.  They do NOT actually repair the damage, which is what I am after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start with Biotene to kill bacteria.  Bacteria AND sugar are necessary for tooth decay.  Then I brush with Age Defying toothpaste on account of its patented liquid calcium.  Then I floss.  Then I use Eco-dent as a rinse.  This product hardens enamel without fluoride, so this is a valuable addition to your dental routine.  Then I rinse with Phos-Flur and go to bed.  The directions say do not eat or drink for one-half hour after using.  So, by going to bed, it can keep working for the duration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this all takes some time.  I can&#x27;t really say if one of the above is the key or if I have achieved a synergy amongst the entire combination.  All I know is that I have had a GREAT result.  In hindsight I would not have bet that my one tooth would have recovered, but it DID.  I am very happy and feel empowered that I have successfully averted dental problems with this routine.</li>
    <li> I think the product is great and it is certainly mild. However, I am giving it 4 stars because the taste is pretty horrible.</li>
    <li> This is my first fluoride rinse, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth did seem to look better with use: The bottom edges of my top front teeth were a bit translucent before I started, but they became slightly more opaque over the course of a month. This effect seems to have plateaued, but I was told that it would take longer to build my teeth back up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently switched to ACT because it was cheaper and it was recommended to be a better value for the money, but the Colgate Phos-Flur tastes better.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended this for me to use nightly.  I didn&#x27;t have time to get to Costco so I was happy to find it at Amazon.  The price was a little higher, but taking time and gas into account, the price is fine.  The taste is pretty good (I ordered the mint), and at 61 years old I am excited about anything that will help me keep my own teeth!</li>
    <li> Its waaay cheaper at Walmart. But the mint takes gross.</li>
    <li> Works great, but my daughter was not a fan of the flavor.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s no surprise that a dentist would recommend the outrageously overpriced Colgate product, since the reason for the high price was to put more money into dentists&#x27; investment accounts. Wal-mart&#x27;s functional equivalent, Equate Anti-Cavity Fluoride Rinse, costs $2.47 for a 16 fl oz bottle. It carries the same seal of ADA approval as the expensive Colgate version and has the same concentration of fluoride.</li>
    <li> The problem with this product is that it can help lead to fluoride toxicity!  It also stained my teeth BLUE.&lt;br /&gt;My hygienist told me that too much fluoride is dangerous (was also brushing twice a day with Clinipro) and she was right.&lt;br /&gt;After stopping the excess fluoride my dizziness, which had gotten severe, went away as well as my fatigue, body aches and easy bruisibility.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a physician and had cut out everything else I could think of without success but wasn&#x27;t aware of the dangers of fluoride toxicity so I&#x27;m passing this along.&lt;br /&gt;BE CAREFUL WITH FLUORIDES!</li>
    <li> The orthodontist recommended this for my son after he got braces.  We were so surprised when we got it 2 days after we ordered it.  Great product and super fast service!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It arrived on time.  My husband and I like the taste, and we will certainly order again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is good for preventing white spots while wearing braces, however it can not replace good oral hygiene. It also does not do well in the mouthwash department, more mint would be better.</li>
    <li> $1/day on mouthwash??????  my dentist recommended it for my 3 kids. so i&#x27;m paying $1,100/yr for mouthwash!!&lt;br /&gt;No thanks.&lt;br /&gt;a tube of toothpaste is $4 and lasts 3-6 months.</li>
    <li> PhosFlur was recommended to me by my dentist.  I have used it for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super sensitive to mint, but this I actually really like. I used it when wearing my braces and have continued to use to it after they were removed. My teeth are less sensitive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had tooth and gum problems.  Using this seems to be helping.  Refreshing too.  I&#x27;ve bought several and I like this brand so I&#x27;ll buy again.  I&#x27;ve not bought the cheaper alternatives yet, so I can&#x27;t really make a comparison.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mouth wash for more than 20-years.  I started just after radiation treatment for cancer that dried my mouth --- a condition that continues today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one time it was prescription but became over-the-counter many years ago.  I&#x27;m not sure if the formulation changed over the years but I feel it help prevent some cavities, but not all.</li>
    <li> I am a dental professional and recommend this for my teen kids.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what I was looking for.  It is a good product to use when you have braces to protect your teeth.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by the orthodontist for my son. He especially likes the mint flavor, which is surprising. It&#x27;s not too minty.</li>
    <li> Dental recommendation to use a fluoride product.  We&#x27;ll see at next check-up how this worked.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s dentist suggested this mouthwash, although he&#x27;s doing great on the generic ACT mouthwash. I have neglected my own dentist&#x27;s visits because I&#x27;m spending so much on his braces and regular check ups. I bought this at the big blue store for $12. Its insane that this costs so much. I&#x27;ve used it for about a week and a half and I&#x27;m really liking it. My tooth enamel feels more like it should after using this. I hope a bottle lasts a while or I may have to give it up. I&#x27;m careful to use the smallest amount I need to swish.  I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because it shouldn&#x27;t cost this much. Also the taste is pretty bad. I&#x27;m not sure you could even get a kid to use it, its so bad.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite mouthwash. I used to use ACT but it was hurting my gums so I stopped. This stuff is good at controlling bad breath and lasts a long time. My mouth feels clean after using it. To me it tastes good but my girlfriend tried it and says it tastes foul, so YRMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars but man is this stuff expensive. I&#x27;m still going to keep buying it but at this price its cheaper to get cavities (in the short term).</li>
