### Positive Reviews

      <li>A wonderful, herbal scent.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, this product is nice</li>

      <li>We&#x27;re buying more :)</li>
      <li>I must say I really love this cleanser.</li>

      <li>/&gt;Cocamidopropyl betaine is a chemical is derived from coconuts and is used to make products produce more foam.</li>
      <li>Just purchased 2 more bottles of it to stock up.</li>
      <li>I love the texture of this foam cleanser.</li>
      <li>I love this organic cleanser.</li>
      <li>It smells great, does an amazing job washing my face, and it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s light, cleans your skin without a stripping it, and smells lovely.  </li>
      <li>I love it and highly recommend it!!!!</li>
      <li>:) I love foam cleansers for the face because it makes it so quick and easy--</li>
      <li>She was pleased with the results and informs me that this product cleans deep and smells great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a scent free person and the flowery fragrance was a bit overwhelming and I was super glad that I used this product Before I showered because the showering helped take away the smell for</li>
      <li>The foam is easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t sting, and even can penetrate (my now copious)</li>
      <li>Plus, it&#x27;s a foam in a pump bottle, which I prefer, for easy application.</li>
      <li>and she has seen advise to avoid strong scented products.  </li>

      <li>I am 48 and am lucky enough to be genetically gifted with great skin.</li>

      <li>The Ageless La Cure Natural, Organic Hydrating and Refreshing Cleansing Foam by Phyto 5 is a pleasant-to-use, effective skin cleanser--perfect for combination skin and warmer weather.</li>
      <li>see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as some others have noted, the packaging could be better, my first bottle arrived and it was leaking and slimy.</li>
      <li>When the end comes, I will have to make the decision whether to return to my original cleansing product or to bite the bullet and click,&#x27;proceed to checkout&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed about this face wash was its lovely verbena scent.</li>
      <li>The foam goes on well and rinses clean.</li>
      <li>sparkling clean versus moisturized.</li>
      <li>skin felt clean and dewy.  </li>
      <li>It effectively cleanses the skin and leaves it soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>So I needed a way to gently clean the sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Rinses clean, no residue.</li>
      <li>It did not make my face feel as clean as my glycerin soap, however.</li>
      <li>I like my skin to feel clean after cleansing and not have a residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so if you like that clean lemon scent, you&#x27;ll like this.  </li>
      <li>Used to use Cetaphil because it was recommended and it did a good enough job...</li>
      <li>: It easily outperformed all cleansers that I own in a similar price</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s still a bit high for me, but much better than before.  </li>
      <li>Overall its a great facial cleanser, and it completely satisfied my wife--she would buy it again.</li>
      <li>At first the foam felt so light</li>
      <li>My face feels incredibly clean after using Ageless La Cure Natural, Organic Hydrating and Refreshing Cleansing Foam by Phyto.</li>
      <li>This has become my new favorite face wash.  </li>
      <li>It foams, which is very soothing and non-abrasive on your face, and washes away easily without leaving any sticky residue.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and many products aggravate it.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use, and my skin felt really soft and smooth after.</li>
      <li>My wife really likes this because it cleans well, doesn&#x27;t dry you out, and smells great.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and gently.</li>
      <li>I tell you how much I love this soap&#x27;s natural scent?</li>
      <li>I thought it smelled fresh and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>: After 3.5 weeks of use, my skin is soft and significantly more</li>
      <li>But, seriously, the smell of this product is so incredible.</li>
      <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think it was going to be worth the cost but after using it I changed my mind.</li>
      <li>I made the mistake of using two pumps the first time and had way too much cleanser on my hands by the time my face was clean.  </li>
      <li>It has a light fresh lemony smell and does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mild and gentle, sweeping away all the dirt that accumulates on your face over the day without stripping or drying.  </li>
      <li>The verbena smell is quite strong, so not advised for those with sensitive noses or allergies.</li>
      <li>They all have lacked in different areas and excelled in others but never have I found one that I loved completely ....</li>
      <li>Great product that I&#x27;m definitely adding to my regular skin-care arsenal.</li>
      <li>This one however is very gentle and hasn&#x27;t bothered my skin at all...</li>
      <li>The foam allows for a generous lather, with a mild and very pleasant scent from the verbena flower and apricot kernel oil (the scent strikes me as citrus-y and natural, with none of the artificial chemical scents found in many beauty products).</li>
      <li>Just clean, fresh, breathable and soft skin.</li>
      <li>: Repeat uses only made the product better.</li>
      <li>First thing I noticed was the verbena scent.</li>
      <li>I tried the product on my hands first, and then used it on my face, still avoiding getting the product in my eyes.</li>
      <li>Will the 5 oz bottle last a month or maybe more?????  </li>
      <li>I love this facial cleanser.  </li>
      <li>The oily areas of my skin become more pronounced in hot, humid weather, and I only wear powder foundation, blush, and eye shadow--no creamy makeup.</li>
      <li>Like a lemon verbena scent, very fresh and natural scent.</li>
      <li>: I&#x27;m typically not a lover of foam-based cleansers, but this one is fantastic.</li>
      <li>certification requires that the product use ingredients derived from renewable resources, manufactured by environmentally friendly processes, is absent of GMO, parabens, phenoxyethanol, nanoparticles, silicon, PEG, synthetic perfumes and dyes, animal-derived ingredients (unless naturally produced by them, e.g., milk, honey), and has biodegradable or recyclable nature of packaging.</li>
      <li>It felt clean, but not dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
      <li>How much would I be willing to pay...</li>
      <li>Cocoyl Glutamate is a mild, non-irritating, all natural, plant-based surfactant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A single pump is plenty for each wash, which makes me think the bottle would last a good amount of time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried 8-10 different cleansers in last year, and this is definitely my favorite!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It smells great. Like a lemon verbena scent, very fresh and natural scent. It&#x27;s a foam - the pump makes it come out foamy - and that makes it so that a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve been using it with a Clearsonic brush, and it works well. Feels really gentle on my skin. Rinses clean, no residue.</li>
    <li> I like a product that is easy to rinse off, but I found this one a little &#x27;sticky&#x27; so that it was hard to remove it quickly and feel that I&#x27;d done so thoroughtly.  With the foam format it&#x27;s is hard to get a precise amount, too.  Other that that it seemed fine, and others might like it.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells really good (a light, clean lemon scent) and exfoliates remarkably well, considering it is a light foam and there are none of the tiny hard bits I&#x27;m accustomed to exfoliating with. Easy to use, and my skin felt really soft and smooth after.</li>
    <li> Phyto 5 Mousse Nettoyante is a cleansing foam delivered by a plastic pump bottle and is made in Switzerland. It is certified organic by Ecocert Greenlife, (more on this below) which was founded in 1991 (France) &amp; is active in over 80 countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Phyto 5 plastic pump dispenser arrived with a sticky residue all over it - enough to allow Amazon’s sticky label to slide right off - so I needed to wash the exterior of the dispenser prior to use. I researched some of the ingredients and they are listed below for anyone interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied two pumps of the foam and massaged my face and neck with it. It smells nice with a citrus scent. I left it on my face while I was preparing shampoo and conditioner for my hair and my face began to tingle, so I washed if off immediately. It did not make my face feel as clean as my glycerin soap, however. I felt as though I had a residue left on my face. Perhaps this is intentional so the foam will be more moisturizing and may be due to the oils it contains like apricot kernel oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that this is an expensive product. I like that it is organic yet I also buy other facial products made expressly for my aging skin. I like my skin to feel clean after cleansing and not have a residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the Organic Certification&lt;br /&gt;The certification requires that the product use ingredients derived from renewable resources, manufactured by environmentally friendly processes, is absent of GMO, parabens, phenoxyethanol, nanoparticles, silicon, PEG, synthetic perfumes and dyes, animal-derived ingredients (unless naturally produced by them, e.g., milk, honey), and has biodegradable or recyclable nature of packaging. The Phyto 5’s bottle has a recycle number of 2 on the bottom. Furthermore, the certification for natural &amp; organic requires a minimum threshold of natural ingredients from organic farming to be reached - 95% of all plant-based ingredients in the formula &amp; 10% of all ingredients by weight fromorganic farming. For this foam (1st &amp; most abundant ingredient is water, which cannot be farmed), it must contain 10% to 40% organic ingredients (95% natural).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the ingredients and their purpose in the cosmetics industry:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lippia Citriodora Flower Water is an aqueous solution made from the steam distillate from the flowers of the Lemon Verbena, Lippia citriodora, &amp; Verbenaceae, which is classified as masking. Masking agents reduce or mask the base odor or aroma of a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coco-betaine is a derivative of cocamide and glycine betaine, made from coconut oil. Is a surfactant (assists in oil removal from skin), foaming agent, viscocity increasing agent, emulsifier, and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cocamidopropyl betaine is a chemical is derived from coconuts and is used to make products produce more foam. It is described as a synthetic surfactant by the Environmental Working Group and has been associated with irritation and allergic contact dermatitis according to Livestrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate is a mild, non-irritating, all natural, plant-based surfactant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sucrose Fatty Acid Esters consist of sucrose, also known as table sugar, combined with various specific fatty acids, or sucrose combined with mixtures of fatty acids from specific plants -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sucrose dilaurate is a sucrose fatty acid ester classified as surfactant skin conditioning emulsifying emollient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorbital is a humectant</li>
    <li> The Ageless La Cure Natural, Organic Hydrating and Refreshing Cleansing Foam by Phyto 5 is a pleasant-to-use, effective skin cleanser--perfect for combination skin and warmer weather. The oily areas of my skin become more pronounced in hot, humid weather, and I only wear powder foundation, blush, and eye shadow--no creamy makeup. I also avoid heavy moisturizers and cleansers that would leave a residue on my skin. The Ageless La Cure Natural, Organic Hydrating and Refreshing Cleansing Foam is light and leaves no trace of \\&quot;clammy\\&quot; moisture behind. It effectively cleanses the skin and leaves it soft and smooth. The lemony scent and quality, certified organic ingredients are a bonus. However, while the Amazon product page and the company product website offer information about how to apply the product, the container itself does not show any usage instructions or warnings about avoiding the eye area or other possible skin sensitivities. I tried the product on my hands first, and then used it on my face, still avoiding getting the product in my eyes. I would recommend this product for those like me with combination skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, this product is nice, my face felt a little fresher (not noticeably), but I noticed I still got black heads and pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin so finding a great moisturizer that cleans my face the way I feel it should is tough. I like that this product is organic, I really do, but I&#x27;m not noticing enough of a difference in my skin to justify completely switching products. If you&#x27;re in a pinch and this is what you have on hand, you could do much, MUCH, worse. But for me, I&#x27;ll stick to my go-to.</li>
    <li> I love the texture of this foam cleanser. I&#x27;m not sure, but I think this will last longer because the foam comes out so airy that I&#x27;m not using that much product. The smell of this is divine. I actually took longer to wash my face because the smell was so soothing. I&#x27;m not sure what age range this product is aimed at. It is definitely not drying, but didn&#x27;t feel as moisturizing as some other products for &amp;#34;mature skin&amp;#34; that I have tried. It may be designed to go with a moisturizer, and I only have this wash. But, seriously, the smell of this product is so incredible. I can still detect a slight whiff of it.</li>
    <li> When my wife chooses beauty products, she usually looks for the most natural ingredients. This wash seemed to satisfy her preference, with 99.3% natural ingredients, and 20% organically farmed. In her skin cleaning routine she daily uses a clarisonic brush to cleanse the face, along with facial cleansers. She found that this foam cleansed her face equally well with the brush or without it. It cleans makeup off very well, and she found it worked well to remove eye makeup without leaving the skin dry or tightened. The smell is a very strong but very pleasant and refreshing citrus scent.  Both my wife and I really liked the smell. She usually uses two pumps for a generous amount of foam to cleanse face and neck. Overall its a great facial cleanser, and it completely satisfied my wife--she would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife at her request. She wanted to try this product and see if it was an improvement over what she normally uses. She was pleased with the results and informs me that this product cleans deep and smells great. She&#x27;s become a convert and plans on continuing to use this face cleaner.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s got a nice scent, kind of like lemongrass, very mild and refreshing. Leaves skin feeling smooth. Plus, it&#x27;s a foam in a pump bottle, which I prefer, for easy application. Recommended. My wife loves it. We&#x27;re buying more :)</li>
    <li> I love oil cleansers, but I do miss the foam that regular &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; style facial washes provide.  This is the perfect marriage of the two!  It&#x27;s mild and gentle, sweeping away all the dirt that accumulates on your face over the day without stripping or drying.  It also smells pretty amazing.  Please note: You will only need ONE pump to get the job done.  I made the mistake of using two pumps the first time and had way too much cleanser on my hands by the time my face was clean.  The verbena smell is quite strong, so not advised for those with sensitive noses or allergies.</li>
    <li> This has become my new favorite face wash.  It&#x27;s light, cleans your skin without a stripping it, and smells lovely.  Actually, you know those moist towelettes you use in restaurants to clean your hands?  It smells just like that--so if you like that clean lemon scent, you&#x27;ll like this.  It foams, which is very soothing and non-abrasive on your face, and washes away easily without leaving any sticky residue.  I also like that it has ingredients I can trust.  Seriously, if you&#x27;re looking for a new face wash, give this a try.  You won&#x27;t be sorry you did.</li>
    <li> I like this foam cleanser a lot. It cleanses my skin well without leaving it overdried, and it has a nice light lemon verbena scent. The foam is... foamy. :) I love foam cleansers for the face because it makes it so quick and easy-- no lathering up required. I have sensitive and acne-prone skin, and this hasn&#x27;t bothered it at all.</li>
    <li> I am 48 and am lucky enough to be genetically gifted with great skin. While I have few lines, few wrinkles, and tiny pores, I still get oily in my T zone and clogged pores around my face, especially when the weather turns warmer. My skin is also quite sensitive, especially to product residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I love this cleanser! The foam goes on well and rinses clean. The residue that some people mention comes from the oil used in the product, which helps keep skin moisturized. It smells good and leaves my skin feeling and looking great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, because it is all organic, my skin hasn&#x27;t reacted to it at all. I had never heard of this brand, but now plan to try their other products.</li>
    <li> This cleansing foam really does offer a deep and gentle clean that leaves your skin with a youthful glow. The foam allows for a generous lather, with a mild and very pleasant scent from the verbena flower and apricot kernel oil (the scent strikes me as citrus-y and natural, with none of the artificial chemical scents found in many beauty products). I have combination skin, and with this product, I have had no dry or oily skin and no breakouts. As an animal lover, I am also pleased that it is vegan and organic.</li>
    <li> Used to use Cetaphil because it was recommended and it did a good enough job...then I found out what&#x27;s in it.  YIKES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is organic certified.  I didn&#x27;t even know they did organic certification on skin care items, but this is amazing.  It&#x27;s Canadian certification, but since that&#x27;s even more stringent standards than USDA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great, moisturizes, gentle and leaves skin smooth.</li>
    <li> My face feels incredibly clean after using Ageless La Cure Natural, Organic Hydrating and Refreshing Cleansing Foam by Phyto. It definitely removes both my makeup and the layer of sunscreen underneath, which my previous cleanser did not do.  It has a light fresh lemony smell and does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells wonderful, and feels so light and creamy. But it doesn&#x27;t clean any better than other facial cleansers I&#x27;ve used, and my skin feels no more hydrated afterward either. I still have to use moisturizer immediately following, and I do not have particularly dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with no instructions, so I used it as I would any other cleanser. A single pump is plenty for each wash, which makes me think the bottle would last a good amount of time. But I could not justify this price when it&#x27;s performance for me is average. Yes, I love the idea of organic ingredients, but there are other organic brands that work just as well and cost much less.</li>
    <li> I have used countless foaming cleansers. They all have lacked in different areas and excelled in others but never have I found one that I loved completely ....till now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed one that would clean serious make up off, smell nice, rinse away easily and not leave my skin dry. Not too much to ask you would think, but most of the time they ALL left my skin dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ageless La Cure Natural cleanser leaves my skin so moisturized, that I do not have to put on any primer or lotion after. NONE. It cleans even the thickest of eyeliner and glittery of shadow away. It is a bit on the expensive but lord its worth it. I have sensitive skin as well, and this does not irritate me at all.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash! It smells great, does an amazing job washing my face, and it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. So many face washes dry my skin out terribly and leave dry patches. This face wash made my skin so soft and moisturized. I love it! At first I didn&#x27;t think it was going to be worth the cost but after using it I changed my mind.</li>
    <li> Just purchased 2 more bottles of it to stock up. I&#x27;ve tried 8-10 different cleansers in last year, and this is definitely my favorite! I have extremely sensitive skin that rotates between being oily and dry. This foaming cleanser feels really good as I massage it into my skin, and once I wash it off, it leaves my skin feeling moist and silky smooth. I especially appreciate the natural, organic certified ingredients and gentle way it treats my skin. I rotated from this to the Neutrogena Naturals cleanser and immediately started breaking out. Now that I&#x27;ve switched back to the Ageless La Cure Natural Cleanser, my skin has cleared up again and is probably the clearest its been in a while. Highly recommend for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I must say I really love this cleanser. At first the foam felt so light, I didn&#x27;t think it would wash well but really you only need a little bit and it cleanses gently but thoroughly. My favorite part, however, is the smell. It&#x27;s not perfumey at all but has a wonderful natural citrusy (lemon verbena maybe?) scent that is just heavenly.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about this face wash was its lovely verbena scent. The next thing I noticed was how creamy the foam felt as I washed my face with it. The third thing I noticed was how soft my face felt after washing. It felt clean, but not dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All biological ingredients in this product are organic, including verbena, apricot kernel oil and lime. This cleansing foam is made in Switzerland, which has high organic standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a little bit of foam to wash your face, so this 5 oz bottle should last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I tell you how much I love this soap&#x27;s natural scent? Heavenly!</li>
    <li> I received this product free of charge in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.  YES .... I like it, I like the way it makes my skin feel, I like the scent, and I like the ease in which it rinses off.  NO.... I do not like that it costs almost $40.  I have very sensitive skin and many products aggravate it.  This one however is very gentle and hasn&#x27;t bothered my skin at all...that alone is worth 5 BIG stars.  Hence I am rating it for the product itself and not the price...that would be closer to two stars.  Since it is a foam , I don&#x27;t have the slightest idea how long the bottle will last.  I have been using it for two weeks.  Will the 5 oz bottle last a month or maybe more?????  I feel that it is very expensive, $40, and truthfully as much as I like it, I would not be willing to pay that much for it even if it does last a month or even a bit more.  I use make up remover and only wash my face with this after I have completely taken off all of my face and eye makeup, so I don&#x27;t know how it works to remove makeup.  Even though I like the look and feel of my skin after  using it, there really isn&#x27;t a whole lot of difference from my regular soap... the main difference is the ease of use and rinsing it off.  Some days I use it twice, others only once, and I dread that each push of the nozzle may be my last. How much would I be willing to pay... good question, but at this point, after only using it for two weeks, I have no figure in mind.  When the end comes, I will have to make the decision whether to return to my original cleansing product or to bite the bullet and click,&#x27;proceed to checkout&#x27;.  UPDATE:  7/1/15 ... I want to thank the seller for reading my comments and doing something about it.  Since I posted the above review, they have lowered the price of this product ... it&#x27;s still a bit high for me, but much better than before.  Thank you - speaks a lot of your customer service.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this because it cleans well, doesn&#x27;t dry you out, and smells great.  The only reason for dropping a star is the price is a bit high and she has seen advise to avoid strong scented products.  I suspect that the scent issue is a non-problem.</li>
    <li> Great product that I&#x27;m definitely adding to my regular skin-care arsenal. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANS WITHOUT DRYING: I&#x27;ve found you often have to sacrifice one or the other--sparkling clean versus moisturized. Not with Ageless La Cure Natural. My skin has that deep-cleaned feeling coupled with hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HYDRATION: After 3.5 weeks of use, my skin is soft and significantly more hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SCENT: A wonderful, herbal scent. I use the Ageless La Cure nightly and it&#x27;s like a touch of aroma therapy before I go to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOAM: I&#x27;m typically not a lover of foam-based cleansers, but this one is fantastic. It goes on smoothly and gently.</li>
    <li> I love this facial cleanser.  It foams nicely and the lemony scent is a delight.  Since it is hydrating, I would normally avoid it because though I am over 50 my skin is still a bit oily at the nose and forehead.  No worries, it cleanses effectively and leaves your skin nice and soft with faint moisture behind.  I checked my face several hours after use and it didn&#x27;t look at oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a refreshing cleaner that is a delight to use.</li>
    <li> I have never used a foam facial cleanser before so I was not sure what to expect. However I can enthusiastically say that I LOVE it!! There is a light, fresh clean scent that is very pleasant and enjoyable. I have trouble with sensitive skin and often my face will feel tight and dry after washing. With the La Cure cleanser I do not have that at all. Just clean, fresh, breathable and soft skin. I love it and highly recommend it!!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different facial cleansers - from neutrogena to clean and clear to clinique. I love this organic cleanser. It is one of those ones that foams when you use the pump. I used this in the shower while washing my face. I wet my face, used one pump of the cleanser, massaged it on my face and then washed it off. First thing I noticed was the verbena scent. I thought it smelled fresh and not overpowering. The next thing I noticed was that after washing off the cleanser, my skin felt hydrated, soft, and smooth to the touch. I am definitely a fan of this cleanser and have to say that it is worth the splurge. It is very gentle on my skin and has not caused my face to breakout in a shade of red from the harshness of the chemicals.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually wash my face.  I know that will sound strange, but my skin is dry and prone to chapping and rashes, so putting anything other than water and moisturizer on it has been my only way of controlling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;ve started to spend a lot of time outdoors and with that, I wear a lot of sunscreen.  So I needed a way to gently clean the sunscreen. This does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt clean and dewy.  Not irritated or raw like some other cleansers I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s just one thing I really, really, really don&#x27;t like;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the smell of verbena flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a scent free person and the flowery fragrance was a bit overwhelming and I was super glad that I used this product Before I showered because the showering helped take away the smell for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will still use this, but only before a shower.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any big changes in my skin yet, but I&#x27;ve only used it three times now so I&#x27;ll have to wait and see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as some others have noted, the packaging could be better, my first bottle arrived and it was leaking and slimy.</li>
    <li> This may be one of the few facial care products I have tried that I am 100% sold on. I&#x27;ll lay it down in some bullet points to speed up your read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1: Gentle. The foam is easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t sting, and even can penetrate (my now copious) beard.&lt;br /&gt;2: Almost 100% organic. This won&#x27;t mar your face with a chemical process.&lt;br /&gt;3: Repeat uses only made the product better. Seriously, after 5 days I saw a massive change in my normal &amp;#34;flaws.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;4: Cleans oily skin but not at the expense of reducing your overall moisture levels.&lt;br /&gt;5: A soothing, inoffensive smell.&lt;br /&gt;6: It easily outperformed all cleansers that I own in a similar price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t always say shell out the big bucks for a perfect facial cleanser, but PHYTO has proven me wrong with this one product. I found myself a believer (and a convert) after five days... and I have a feeling you will say the same.</li>
