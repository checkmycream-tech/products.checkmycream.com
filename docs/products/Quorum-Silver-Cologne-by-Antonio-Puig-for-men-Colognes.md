<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Unusual scent. Wife says it stinks.</li>
    <li> Smells like tress. Exactly what you&#x27;d think. I am the best smelling gentleman with this product wafting from my clothes. Not overbearing, nor overtly tree-like, but smooth. Like a fine glass of whiskey, tempered by iced glass and cubes made from unicorn tears. If you&#x27;re looking for a cedar scented cologne, buy this one. Godspeed.</li>
    <li> Nice unique scent, I wanted to try out the silver because i love the original.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
    <li> I purchased several Gift~Sets of this scent years ago. Mainly for being the brother of the original Quorum and it was on sale. Reminiscent of fragrances of yesteryear with many other wonderful layers, especially Wood. Nothing too strong or offensive. To me, there is no similarity to the original Quorum. I use Quorum Silver for it&#x27;s fresh but sultry vibrant mix. As the years pass either my olfactory sniffer has changed or the fragrance does sitting on the shelf and for the better.  The white musk &amp; tea attributes get lighter so it is mostly romantic cedar or spruce notes now. I have no clue if this brand is being reissued / reproduced or only old stock is being sold off so buying this again will be a worthy gamble. Running out plus a good temporary price makes it time to repurchase &amp; stock up. BTW/ OT The original Quorum appears to be gone for good; every time I order it, a rancid bottle arrives. Whatever is in the original does not get better with age like it&#x27;s brother Silver. If this is old stock, it hasn&#x27;t gained any awful spoiled smell (yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Today&#x27;s shipment appears to be recently manufactured. Bright, New, &amp; Shiny Silver Boxes. Again, no spoiled oils. Arrived within a week. My opinion: The fresh bottle is more announced out of the gate with notes of Black Licorice, Hot Cinnamon Candy, Cedar, White Musk, Tea &amp; Menthol [Tea, Musk &amp; Menthol are not listed ingredients only notes that I, alone, perceive]. It still reduces to an inviting but a less intense, lightly sweet scent after an hour or so when the top notes drop off. The staying power generally lasts to the next morning. A nice sensual fragrance to wake up to and especially smell on someone else.  A partial list of the ingredients are: Limonene, Linalool, Citral, Coumarin, Eugenol, Geraniol, Cinnamal, Isoeugenol, Parfum, and 80% vegetal alcohol. It claims to be made in Spain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Depending on who the seller is, what arrives at your door will be anyone&#x27;s guess but for me, so far so good.

    <li> THIS IS THE ONLY COLOGNE MY HUSBAND WILL WEAR. WE TRAVELED OUT OF STATE ON ONE OF OUR TRIPS AND FOUND SOME, HE USED IT ALL AND ASK ME TO FIND SOME MORE.  JUST HAPPENED TO GO TO AMAZON AND FOUND IT, HE WAS SO HAPPYi</li>
    <li> Excellent price and aroma.  Had a few compliments already and that&#x27;s always a plus when  it comes from a nice looking girl.  Will definitely buy it again when I use it up.</li>
    <li> I love this aroma!  It is a very nice addition to a masculine sent!</li>
    <li> Is not what i expected. .</li>
    <li> If you want to smell real good without breaking the bank, give this a try.  It has a very clean manly scent that women like!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this for my husband, I love this a lot, it does not last long, but it definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> The regular Quorum in my opinion smells even better than the Quorum Silver but this one seems to gets me plenty of compliments as well.</li>
    <li> What can I say: I love the scent, it is not overly expensive and then Amazon did a great job as usual getting it to me at a great price (and it being available). Amazon rocks as usual!</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  Shipped quickly and it was exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> I wear this myself and get many compliments. It has a sexy scent to it and men often ask me what I&#x27;m wearing. ENJOY</li>
    <li> You will either love this perfume or hate it. It is more suited for adults and mature people and, as far as the scent is concerned, I would say it is not bad but I would only use it in cold weather (winter), because the main notes that are projected by this perfume are spicy and woody.</li>
    <li> It kind of lasted more than 12 hours or so, but not all day</li>
    <li> Smells great, a bit fruity</li>
    <li> Listed as an EdT, but weak, maybe a cologne. Scent is good. I wear it as an everyday scent.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like Quorum don&#x27;t be put off by the name of this - this has nothing in common with Quorum, it&#x27;s a completely different scent. It is also far better than it&#x27;s price suggests it will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially muted fruit/citrus and slightly sweet woodiness with a bit of depth. Later there is a slight pepperiness, more depth and a little hint of smokiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appears to be quite weak at first but it seems to strengthen as it warms on your skin. Projection is subtle but quite strong for 5+ hours and it still has some projection for hours beyond that. Longevity is good - it is clear and quite strong on skin for around 8 hours and doesn&#x27;t disappear for 11+ hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth a try. A very good, safe, subtle and fresh/woody scent that is excellent value. Smells great, lasts very well and projects quite well. For me it is an office/everyday fragrance for warmer weather.</li>
    <li> Came with no plastic wrapping, the box &amp; bottle looks dirty/old &amp; the plastic cap has huge cracks on both sides so it can&#x27;t be covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sucks.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast, nice smell, all good</li>
    <li> Smells great. Easy on the wallet. I use this one when going out at night and the regular Quorum during the day. Lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> This smells good and it will you some attention.</li>
    <li> A clean mild scent that does not make my eyes water or give me a headache.  While it is not my favorite, it is certainly not the worst.  I would describe it as a clean plain scent, definitely not overpowering or offensive, but somewhat boring and rather uninteresting.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, although a big fan of cologne, and the original Quorum, this fragrance wasn&#x27;t all that nice.  It was a disappointment.  Thankfully, not an expensive experiment in a new fragrance!</li>
    <li> Right choice, I love it</li>
    <li> very good for the price. Satisfied.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and value.&lt;br /&gt;Totally was received as described.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The Totally Shipping was fast and in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma of this fragrance I love. Lasts longer than 8 hours and is always imbued with your clothing.&lt;br /&gt;Personally I like strong fragrances or aroma is shocking as he passed other fibula.&lt;br /&gt;There will always be someone asking for that fraganacia ..&lt;br /&gt;Excellent Purchase</li>
    <li> Great product at affordable price</li>
    <li> Have only been wearing this a couple of weeks and have already gotten a lot of compliments! Very manly sent that is bold but isn&#x27;t overkill. Hangs around for a while so you don&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;re-dose&amp;#34; yourself every couple of hours! I just switched from Michael Jordan&#x27;s 24 to this and it definitely exceeds my expectations.</li>
    <li> Been my favorite for years. If it&#x27;s not broke don&#x27;t fix it...When it comes to a cologne, I like to stick with what works for me not to mention I like the scent</li>
    <li> Always my favorite. Excellent price for a great product.</li>
    <li> One of the best smelling colognes on the market ... most people walk by (men and women but mostly women) and alway ask me ... what is that you are wearing ... you smell great ... whats there NOT to like about that :-) ... this order was for my son who is away for school and love&#x27;s it too!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, great price.  And best of all my wife really likes the smell.  That is all the encouragement I need.  It compares very favorably to many others for which I have paid much more.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite fragrance - a little too strong and long lasting..  I much prefer the original &amp;#34;Quorum&amp;#34; in the dark bottle.</li>
    <li> My bf has forgotten his other cologne.  He smells nice, don&#x27;t mind cuddling now. Great price!</li>
    <li> The scent is great and I receive a lot of comments about this manly fragrance.  I highly recommend this product from this vendor.  Amazon does great on getting the best for least.</li>
    <li> My favorite summer cologne.  Light and clean smelling. The regular Quorum is much heavier.</li>
    <li> Have used this fragrance a number of times over the years and keep coming back....It lasts a good part of the day.</li>
    <li> I ordered this just by reading the reviews. My husband loves cologne. He wears it morning, noon, and night. He doesn&#x27;t know how to be conservative. He has to spray 3/4 times. I hope he likes it. Would I recommend? Yes</li>
    <li> MAN!!!!! If you want a fragrance that the women go WILD for THIS IS IT!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have women stop me on the street to ask me what the fragence is. REMARKABLE!!!!!!</li>
    <li> i like this cologne because it sticks and has a sweet smell. the funny thing is that i went to hooters with my buddies and the waitress said someone smells like pine sol and i started laughing. it was the 1st ever hearing that comment but i guess maybe it does. atleast i smelled like a  clean floor anyways. lol</li>
    <li> I bought this without knowing what the fragrance smelled like. I enjoy the original Quorum so I bought this items after reading the customer reviews. This fragrance is a winner. Great value for the money and a wonderful every day cologne. Amazon did a great job on the delivery.</li>
    <li> Pretty strong. Peppery flower smell.</li>
    <li> Bought this after reading some recommendations for a &amp;#34;cedar&amp;#34; scented cologne.  No so much the scent I was looking for, but not at all bad,&lt;br /&gt;either.</li>
    <li> for the cost Quorum is always a good buy</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied. thanks.I am completely satisfied. thanks. I am very happy with this product.  Keep selling the good stuff please.  thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> Never smelt this one before until today. It&#x27;s the most delightful thing I&#x27;ve smelt in a while. It really is a great scent.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colognes and I couldn&#x27;t believe the price that I got it for.</li>
    <li> Excellent scent. Well worth every penny</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this Eau De Toilette years ago, but forgot all about it until I saw it on Amazon and bought several (for myself and for gifts). The scent is strong so you don&#x27;t need to use much and it lasts for most of the workday or if you&#x27;re going out. Very happy with the scent and will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cologne. The only reasonI did not give it a 5 star rating was because it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like it to.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best colognes I&#x27;ve had in a very long time. The scent is very unique, it lasts for a very long time (most often up to 12 hours, depending on how much you sweat), and people can immediately recognize it, particularly girls, as guys haven&#x27;t given me much comments or compliments on this cologne. I&#x27;ve been using this for years so I recommend you try it.</li>
    <li> If you want to be different from other, and if you want people ask: what perfume do you use?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then buy this one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stays over 24 hours on cloths.</li>
    <li> Nice scent, as acceptable at work as it is out on the town. Nicely concentrated, a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve been a regular Quorum wearer for years, and this is a nice change. My wife likes it, I like it.</li>
    <li> it is ok.  had better. wont by again.</li>
    <li> My son loves the way the colone smells and so do I, he wears it almost everywhere he goes.  He is already inquiring as to how to reorder.</li>
    <li> Strong cedar and vanilla. I noticed girls tend to hover around me when I&#x27;m wearing it. Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> exactly what i expected</li>
    <li> This was a gift to a family member, so I can&#x27;t comment.</li>
    <li> This is a very strong scent and you shouldn&#x27;t purchase it unless the man you are buying for has already tried it on and liked it.  It doesn&#x27;t go well with everyone&#x27;s body chemistry.</li>
