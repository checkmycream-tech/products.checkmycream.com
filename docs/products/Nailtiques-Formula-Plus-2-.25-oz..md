    <li> If you want long strong nails purchase this product. I wore acrylics for twenty five years.&lt;br /&gt;I now use this and my own nails are just as strong with no need for the cost and hassle of biweekly trips to the salon.&lt;br /&gt;Please see my review of the nailtiques nail oil and padded nail files. It will help you. You need all three and the prices are very reasonable.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work I used it for months and my nails are still brittle and weak.</li>
    <li> Best stuff I ever used.</li>
    <li> Love this and will continue to use Nailtiques in the future. For the 1st time in years,I am able to have my own nails back and stronger then ever.I have been able to get away from the acrylic nails which damaged my nails even more.I have spent so much money on products claiming to do what Nailtiques has done. Thank you Nailtiques!! Way to go!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Clear, hardens quickly, doesn&#x27;t yellow, stays on for a good week.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this product and has purchased it perhaps a dozen times in the past but this bottle is half the size I&#x27;ve purchased previously and the price here is almost double I&#x27;ve found it elsewhere.</li>
    <li> My nails had been breaking for several years, especially if I used nail polish on them. They would remain breaking and peeling until the nail regrew completely after polish use. I tried Nail Envy--the same thing happened. I resigned myself to the fact that I couldn&#x27;t use anything on my nails...then I did an internet search that directed me to Nailtiques. Thanks to Amazon and it&#x27;s wonderful reviews I decided to give Nailtiques a test...I couldn&#x27;t be happier...it has been a couple of months now that I&#x27;ve been using it an I can honestly say that since I began not one nail has broken---I have just ordered my second bottle! Nailtiques is a winner!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best thing that has happened to my nails!!!!</li>
    <li> Since going back to natural nails, I use this all the time, and my nails are stronger and growing very nicely..... Still looks like I have artificial nails, but they are my own now !!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I have been using it for years and years with great success.  With regular use this product keeps my nails healthy.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF WORKS!  After using this product for over three months, I can truthfully say that my nails are harder, thicker, peel less/crack less.  I&#x27;m so excited!  My nails have grown faster than expected.  But you MUST follow the instruction to achieve its benefits.</li>
    <li> I give a 3 stars not because of the product is because for me is too early to see improvement, my nails start to get a little bit better, I hope in few months will see better results</li>
    <li> I have been searching for something like this product for probably 40 years.  My nails chip anytime they get any length at all and this  Nailtiques formula +2 has done a wonderful job on most of them . I actually have a thumbnail that is extending beyond my thumb flesh!  You really need to follow the instructions well. Mine are still growing out and I have yet to see whether the new nail from the nailbed is going to stop splitting, but I have great hopes!  Just an additional thought, the product has a great shine so that my nails look great even without color.</li>
    <li> My nails love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I needed this product.  Has help strengthen my weak nails.</li>
    <li> Works great.. I&#x27;ll definately buy again!!</li>
    <li> This stuff was totally amazing. And I NEVER give 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Whatever is in it absolutely corrected my awfully splitting nails. In about a week. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> My raggedy nails have been helped tremendously with this product.  I cut them all off and began applying a coat of Nailtiques each night.  Even if I had polish on, I continued the nightly application.  After a month, my nails were no longer peeling, no longer brittle and had grown to a healthy length.  I totally recommend this product.</li>
