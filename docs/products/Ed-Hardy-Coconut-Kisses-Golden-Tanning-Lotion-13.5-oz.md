<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product is absolutely amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. After tanning, it has a clean/fresh scent.</li>
    <li> Ed Hardy lotions are unbelievably wonderful. I had second thoughts before I started using his line of tanning lotion, thinking it would be mediocre. It really has a wonderful color and doesn&#x27;t leave you orange or streaked as some lotion can that have bronzers. This is the second type of Ed Hardy lotion I have tried and is really excellent.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great, goes on smooth! Unfortunately if you are a constant tanner and looking to get darker this is not the lotion for you. I have been using it for 4 visits and don&#x27;t notice a change in color.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feel.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a great smell and does not have a bad after smell.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It has a pleasant smell and don&#x27;t make you stink after tanning as some of the other tanning lotions do. It has a reasonable price as well.</li>
    <li> Love this tanning lotion. Not only does it work and make my skin extremely dark in the tanning bed, it Also works as an immediate tan at home because of its added bronzer. Smells awesome and hydrates and nourished my skin. A little goes a long way. Highly recommended. People are saying that it does not have a bronzer but they are obviously not paying attention to the label which clearly states: Melanobronze which accelerates the tanning process because it&#x27;s a bronzer...get it Melabronze....bronzer.. Anyway this product rocks in and out of the tanning bed!</li>
    <li> Smells AMAZING!!! Its very moisturizing, its not sticky and it goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> Finally a tanning lotion that doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;stink\\&quot; after tanning in the tanning bed.  I will not use anything else after trying this.  It smells more like vanilla than coconut, but still smells nice.  I don&#x27;t feel \\&quot;yucky\\&quot; after tanning.</li>
    <li> The lotion itself covered good. What I didn&#x27;t care for was the scent. There is no hint of a coconut smell. The scent has a very strong perfume smell that is very overwhelming. If you are sensitive to smells I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> I use this every time I go tan. I love the smell, it absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel soft!</li>
    <li> I got this because it&#x27;s the only one I could find that promised no bronzer yet smelled great. The no bronzer may be true but the scent is not coconut. It&#x27;s more of Avon old lady perfume, which makes me sick. If you like super perfumey granny scent this is for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to tanning, and as such am trying several different lotions to determine *my* favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Coconut Kisses it a good one, to be sure. I love the smell of this lotion. The coconut vanilla scent is just sweet enough to be pleasant but not so overpowering that you need to feel paranoid about it. There is no after tan odor when I use this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Coconut Kisses feels nice on my skin and rubs in well. I do not feel sticky or greasy at all with this lotion. My skin is soft feeling, though not as silky soft as silicone emulsion lotions can acheive. To be perfectly honest, I would rate this stuff at four and a half stars, but Amazon doesn&#x27;t give me that option. If this had some silicone emulsion in it it would be the most fantastic lotion out there!&lt;br /&gt;I like this better than Phoenician (even though Phoenecian is a silicone based lotion) because the smell of this stuff is much nicer to my nose. Also, when I leave the tanning bed after wearing Coconut Kisses I can *feel* that it works as an intensifier. I almost have a slight sunburn feel, even though I do not have any redness. To me, this tells me that Coconut kissed is better at intensifying the rays of the tanning bed, better than the other lotions I have anyway...</li>
    <li> Great deal, tanning salons and even the gym charge double or more. Does smell more like vanilla than coconut. Smells like Bath and Body works Vanilla and Brown Sugar lotion. I would pay for the shipping though, the super saver ships too slowly.</li>
    <li> To many chemicals that made my skin get bumps every time I used it. I had to switch lotions imidiatly</li>
    <li> I really like the packaging.  The one I got dosnt have a smell at all and I have been using for 2 weeks and can&#x27;t really even tell a difference with my tanning.</li>
    <li> Very Pleased.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion on the market in my opinion.  Great smell, easy to apply, and super results.  I tan daily for two hours and this stuff is the bomb~</li>
    <li> Has a neat bottle with a very secure lid-which is a plus cause my last stuff spilled all over my gym bag lol.  I could take it or leave it.  It&#x27;s a very smooth no-tingle lotion, but it didn&#x27;t enhance my tan at all.  Which I guess is okay cause I didn&#x27;t want to go zero-to-dark chocolate (lol) in a month.  But now I have been tanning daily in amazing beds I would imagine It would be noticeable.  I actually got a sunburn outside last weekend lol.  It does really soften skin but if your wanting a super dark tan don&#x27;t buy this one.  Smell is so-so:  there&#x27;s no burnt skin smell afterwards, and I&#x27;ve tanned and then gone straight to work and got complemented on my &amp;#34;perfume.&amp;#34;  But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as amazing as some of the other reviews. Also, it doesn&#x27;t turn your clothing orange upon contact.  It would be a good lotion for someone who rotates out lotions, at least ones or twice a week I would use a tingle-lotion or one that really darkens.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, wished it smelled more like coconut . It really picks up my tan.</li>
    <li> i was quite Happy with the results.</li>
    <li> GREAT indoor tanning lotion. Can definitely tell a difference using it just twice. Only issue is that I wish it smelled more tropical, it barely has a scent. However, Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this lotion once and I love it! I have a tattoo that&#x27;s already had the color touched up once, so the tattoo protection&#x27;s something that interested me. I can&#x27;t verify yet whether or not that works simply because I haven&#x27;t used the lotion long enough. I still feel like I can give a fair review, though. I just started tanning this year. I&#x27;ve bought a selection of lotions to try. This is my favorite one yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to other reviews, I do think this lotion smells like coconut. I actually was quite careful in sniffing it due to all of the compliments/complaints of it smelling like vanilla. My sense of smell isn&#x27;t great, but it smells like coconut to me...and it is divine!! It made the whole room smell like a tropical party. I didn&#x27;t find it overwhelming. Just nice. It&#x27;s not a feminine smell. It smells tropical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe it worked great as an accelerator. After only one session, I can see a difference. I could actually see it in the mirror immediately after leaving the bed. This is the first lotion I&#x27;ve tried where that happened. There is not supposed to be any bronzers or tingle, but it really did make a difference. It also left my skin feeling soft and nice. Overall, this is the best one I&#x27;ve tried yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m quite happy with Coconut Kisses. I&#x27;ll buy this again. For the money, it&#x27;s the best lotion I&#x27;ve tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add: After using the entire bottle, I&#x27;m even happier with Coconut Kisses. It&#x27;s an awesome lotion. I&#x27;m about to order more. Think I found a keeper.</li>
    <li> Works great! Tans amazingly gives a better color quicker. Smooth and smells great.</li>
    <li> Excellent deal!!! Will definitely order again!!</li>
    <li> Smells so good even after tanning</li>
    <li> Love the smell but didn&#x27;t seem to get as dark from other lorions</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me at all I am completely disappointed I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone buy this</li>
    <li> Got this product in a good time. But the product itself, well it smells great and feels good going on. Other than that, not a really great tanning lotion. I wont be buying it again. Im fair. and I like to go to the tanners to keep color and not be so pale. This didn&#x27;t show any signs of helping me achieve a good base at all. I thought it was a fail.</li>
    <li> I thought I read that is was an aloe based product, it is not.  It&#x27;s okay for what it is but I thought it would have more or a coconut fragrence.  It doen&#x27;t small bad, but not like coconut.</li>
    <li> Nice scent,applies easily. I have had no problems with dry skin after tanning. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE COCONUT Smell!! I don&#x27;t smell like tanner after using it. Just a bit sweaty but that&#x27;s to be expected after baking under the bulbs. I did plateau with this lotion but it did a great job of protecting my tattoo and moisturizing my skin. I know use it in combination with the Black Elixir Tanning lotion from Ed Hardy. Ed Hardy should make a coconut accelerator!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used about ten different lotions and this is the first one to irate my skin? Test your skin first with this.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion! It makes my skin so soft and the best part it smells delicious! ! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> does not smell as I expected, but it&#x27;s okay!</li>
    <li> Great smell, goes on smooth and helps you tan quicker.</li>
    <li> I love the sugary coconut smell of this lotion. Makes my skin feel smooth as well.</li>
    <li> Smells really nice, haven&#x27;t had strong results just yet with the lotion but leaves my skin soft and smelling nice even after tanning. Think I&#x27;ll just switch this up with a bronzing lotion in between tanning visits and my tan will be legit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again. Product is thick and comes sealed.</li>
    <li> works and smells great!</li>
    <li> love the coconut sent, lotion was very good also</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this lotion.</li>
    <li> Wonderful tanning lotion!!!! Love Rd Hardy products. ..</li>
    <li> Loved it! Smells awesome!!! Super fast shipping too😊</li>
    <li> My daughter seems to like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say it is not up to my expectations. I thought it would have more of a coconut smell and&lt;br /&gt; my skin was very dry from using it. Also I did not see to much of a golden tan. I regret spending $18.95 for this lotion.</li>
    <li> Have only used a couple of time so far but it smells great. I don&#x27;t have the burnt, after tan smell. My skins feels soft and smooth as well. So far, so good!</li>
    <li> Smell is great and no bronzer which is exactly what I was looking for - bronzer makes me orange - this product works with no ugly orange tint on my very pink toned skin.</li>
    <li> Love lotion and price was great.</li>
    <li> All are great. Love the Hemp lotions( except for the coconut watermelon)  tamning smells nice coconut but not fake smell, works great.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Not overwhelming like some when you tan.</li>
    <li> Smells great, leaves my skin soft, and I had great tanning results. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Really I can not leave a review the item was never out of the bag and was returned,  why I&#x27;m asked to write a review I have no idea? I did look at one of the ingredients and decided not to use it.  that is about all I can say.</li>
    <li> Very pleased, item arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for its intended purpose yet, but it smells really good and felt nice on my skin whenever I put a dab onto my hands to see how well it went in. If nothing else you&#x27;ll have soft skin and a great scent using this.</li>
    <li> okay tanning lotion...not too crazy about the smell</li>
    <li> Love the smell of coconut! Its a great tanning bed lotion :)</li>
    <li> AWESOME!!! LOVE the scent and tanning results!!</li>
    <li> This definitely made my skin tan better! It is super moisturizing. I purchased this on Amazon due to the great reviews. I don&#x27;t really love the smell, it has a little too much perfume scent for me and not enough coconut. It&#x27;s not terrible though so I will keep using the entire bottle. Will probably purchase something else though, because if you are a coconut lover this is not the ticket.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of the lotion and it does not stain your hands.  I use it when I am in the tanning bed and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells amazing but be aware that once you shower the bronzer washes away and that&#x27;s kinda disappointing. I wanted something to help me get darker and this did help - just not as well as I had expected or hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good all-around lotion, for the price I would say this is a great deal! Absorbs well into skin and despite the name, the coconut smell is not overbearing.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really have any smell.  Nice price. Just expected more in the aroma department</li>
    <li> Love the smell &amp; my skin is so soft , it does not leave a tanning bed odor on my skin</li>
    <li> Very happy, nice feeling &amp; scent.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion because it does not contain bronzers and my hands don&#x27;t get all orange.  I think it does help you tan darker.</li>
    <li> Smells like coconut, has age deifying components, no tingle and it does not leave brown streaks from applying.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Very moisturizing and gave me a great tan. Has more vanilla than coconut smell though.</li>
    <li> The smell of coconut is out of this world. Makes you very soft. Not as good as tanista, but is my second favorite.</li>
    <li> Getting a great tan using this product!!</li>
    <li> Works great. Does not tingle, but help you tan.</li>
    <li> Smells great, although hardly like coconut.  Luxurious consistency, goes on great, good value.  I purchased two and am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Smell is more vanilla than coconut, &amp; is very light. This lotion does not streak or stain hands. I usually don&#x27;t tan quickly. I have been using it for about a week, &amp; I&#x27;m gaining good color.</li>
    <li> Love the scent.  Leaves skin feeling very soft and no bad after smell after tanning like most lotions do.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells great, doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes when I work out, and definitely helps the tan. A great product to say the least.</li>
    <li> Love it! Spreads really well and has a pleasant aroma!</li>
    <li> Smells great, and really moisturizes your skin!</li>
    <li> love the smell and texture. excellent tanning lotion.  great price.</li>
    <li> I seriously LOVE this lotion. It makes my skin feel so soft after I use it. It&#x27;s light, so it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or give me weird, gross breakouts in weird places. I use it on my face as well and no breakouts there either (and I am fairly sensitive). It smells awesome too! It also has tattoo fade protector in it, so you can tan if you have tattoos. It doesn&#x27;t take any longer than normal to tan my skin. Works at a good, average page. I love it and will be back for more as soon as I am out!</li>
    <li> Smell is amazing! I want to wear it instead of perfume!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it is a great moisturizer and I really do like the bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;I have always steered far away from bronzers due to the orange color most develop.&lt;br /&gt;Not with this item. The bronzer is good and not too powerful. That, to me is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;I love how my skin feels once it&#x27;s absorbed and after my tan, soft and hydrated. The smell is like the other reviewer said vanilla, milk, and coconut, so warm notes. It lasts after the tan, and even though you will always get that after-tan-smell this seems to make the effect not so devastating to the olfactory, and in fact I don&#x27;t feel the need to immediately go shower because I still smell good!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really feel like I&#x27;ve gotten  much darker, and I don&#x27;t think it smells that  great either but it does go on smooth and not sticky.</li>
    <li> I love it! Works great and smells good, well worth the money! Will be buying more again, thank you</li>
    <li> Smells really good, just doesn&#x27;t really improve my tanning.</li>
    <li> works like magic everntually</li>
    <li> Love this!!  It makes my skin soft plus gives me a nice bronze look. Good price and smells great!! Worth trying!!!</li>
    <li> i love this lotion and so do my friends. ive gotten alot of them addicted to tanning now and they all want to use this lotion. i mainly bought it because it has tattoo protectent, but it smells great too!</li>
    <li> I bought this on Amazon, because my Tan Salon charges tripple for these kinds of products, and I refuse to pay upwards of $70 for a tanning lotion!  I was not disappointed, either with Amazons amazing prices, or with the results I received from this lotion!  The name and bottle would suggest more of a coconut smell, it has a subtle vanilla scent instead.  Which is still a nice smell, going on and after tanning.  It doesn&#x27;t have that after tan burn smell, goes on non-greasy and stays smelling fresh until I shower it off.  It makes my skin soft, and does a great job at getting me tan.  I don&#x27;t like tinglers or bronzers.  I would rather have a natural tan instead of one enhanced with a bronzer.  I might as well just buy a self tanner lotion and forgo the tan salon if I wanted that!!  I would recommend this to anyone looking for the same!  Great product from Ed Hardy, and a great price!  Have not used any of the other Ed Hardy lines of tanning... not because I don&#x27;t like them, but I also needed something to protect my Tattoo&#x27;s... which it delivers on!</li>
    <li> As a rule I like Ed Hardy products. But not this one. Put on a tiny sample, and I couldn&#x27;t to wash it off. Will send in for a refund.</li>
    <li> It had a great smell, and went on good and absorbed fast! And it left a beautiful golden color after tanning, this is by far one of my favorite lotions that I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> I tried several of these bronzing lotions but couldn&#x27;t deal with most of them due to the smell. This one is fairly strong but the coconut smell doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff!!! It also does a really good job of bronzing!</li>
    <li> It has a bronze r in it and smells like coconut. Love it would buy it again and recommend to others</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. Can&#x27;t wait to try it tomorrow.</li>
    <li> Meh.. Okay for the price. Smells coconuty but in a cheap way.. Nice thickness.. No shimmer. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and adds a nice tanned look</li>
    <li> Does nothing at all. Returned.</li>
    <li> Smells more vanilla than coconut but it works really well. Item arrived promptly and I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it.</li>
    <li> Love this and it smells amazing</li>
    <li> The smell is so good!  When I used it in my tanning booth, I did not have that &amp;#34;burnt skin&amp;#34; smell.  Used it outside by the pool and it was equally wonderful!!  Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> smell great, works good</li>
    <li> This lotion is wonderful! Has a great smell &amp; gives a nice, natural looking tan. It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy, but it&#x27;s an excellent moisturizer. I ordered this product on a Sunday &amp; recieved it the following Thursday. So the shipping is great as well! I loved this lotion so much that I introduced it to the ladies that own the local tanning salon and they not only ordered it for themselves, but they also purchased it to sell in the salon! All in all, it&#x27;s a great product. I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff - smells good too!</li>
    <li> Works great and smells heavenly!!</li>
    <li> Great smell and seems to leave a nice color after tanning. The smell is nice too but not too much where people know you&#x27;ve been tanning. Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> After reading reviews, I was expecting for this lotion to smell like coconut with a hint of vanilla.  To me, it smells like vanilla perfume and it does not dissipate.  I was disappointed because I love coconut!  I used this on my 2nd tanning session and I noticed quite a color change.  The moisturization is ok, but I think that Australian Gold&#x27;s accelerator is much more moisturizing.  Will not order again.</li>
    <li> It smells great, was delievered on time i have used it 3 times and i still have seen no results.  I bought it because of the tattoo anti fade and the fact i dont like the tingle.  And my legs will not tan so i was hoping it would help but it did not.</li>
    <li> Love this tanning lotion. Smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I like the Ed hardy tanning lotions. I don&#x27;t think this one accelerates your tan anymore than the others, but it smells good and keeps your skin soft.</li>
    <li> Great lotion and amazing scent!</li>
    <li> Loved the results of this lotion! My skin Is really soft and smells so good after use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of tanning lotions and this is by far my least favorite. Yes it is very moisturizing but for color, it&#x27;s not a good lotion. You will not get immediate color with this lotion. It smells great, but to me, it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference while I was tanning. The main thing with this lotion is the smell. It smells more like perfume than it does coconut. The smell stays on your skin for hours!</li>
    <li> Smells great before and after tanning. Not greasy to apply and provides a nice tan. It was packages well and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> The smell did not impress me....</li>
    <li> This lotion is wonderful...it does not leave a nasty feeling or color on your skin.  Way cheaper then buying it at a salon.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly, so affordable, works great for beginning tanning. After I got my base color, I stepped up to a higher bronzer. Definitely recommend! Has a wonderful smell, &amp; you will love this!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that smelled like coconut, like old fashioned tanning lotion. This lotion, unfortunately, doesn&#x27;t, it has the barest hint of coconut scent, and is mostly vanilla smelling. Other than that disappointment, it seems to be a good lotion, and leaves my skin very smooth. With this bottle design and name, I expected more of a real coconut scent....</li>
    <li> I usually buy another lotion for tanning, but was tempted to buy this one because of the reviews. I made a great choice! This lotion goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t smudge or leave streaks. The smell is beyond wonderful! It covers up your sweaty smell if you use it after going to the gym, haha!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion because there are NO bronzers, but you get dark just as fast. You don&#x27;t have the orange look after using Coconut Kisses. Smells great too.... Best tanner one on the market for getting dark quickly! :)</li>
    <li> Disappointed. I could barely smell the lotion. It went on well tho, not too thick.</li>
    <li> NO after smell. This leaves you with a light more vanilla, little coconut scent. I would use this more in the summer because there&#x60;s not a lot of moisturizer in it.Maybe that&#x60;s just me. Its very light and goes on easily.</li>
    <li> After reviewing this product on the internet, I found that most people do not believe it is a true tanning lotion, but a moisturizer.  Because of this, I use it primarily a just that...a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning every spring for the last 7 years and have tried numerous lotions.  This is by far my fave!  The best part about it is the smell (or lack thereof).  It doesn&#x27;t smell quite like coconuts but more like vanilla (like everyone else has said). AND there is no &amp;#34;tanning&amp;#34; smell after you get out of the bed.  In fact, it still smells good.  I can leave it on for hours afterward and not even notice.  It&#x27;s really light and silky and feels great on.&lt;br /&gt;Also, (more importantly), it works great.  I am fair skinned and don&#x27;t tan easy.  So I build very slowly.  I have noticed a really great brown tan from this lotion and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  People have given me lots of compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will ever use another kind.  I&#x27;m off to order another bottle!!  :)</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion isn&#x27;t a bronzer so don&#x27;t expect instant color, but it does give you a really nice brown color usually i start looking orange with bronzers so i am loving this lotion, my tan lasts really long, my skin is extremely soft, and it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Tan lotion works great for indoor/outdoor use.</li>
    <li> I tan pretty easily. Ive tried soany tanning lotions wih bronzers , cheap ones and expensive ones, do not like tanning lotions with bronzers. I like the natural dark tan that i get from non-bronzing tanning lotions. And so far, this tanning lotion is the best ive used yet. The smell is wondeful, and it helps nurish and moisten my skin while giving me that natural dark tan. Ive been tanning for over 10 yrs. And this is by far the best tanning lotion ive used. I can use this tanning lotion when i lay out at the pool too. Still get a good tan. So it is good for outdoor and indoor tanning. Thank you.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t rly like it. I don&#x27;t personally feel it did anything for me and I already have a base tan. ima use it for outside &amp; stick with my jwow for indoors.</li>
    <li> Love this, makes your skin so soft and the smell is not over powering.</li>
    <li> I thought I would try this out because I use his perfume and love it. I like this lotion but unfortunately I plateaued and had to switch to a lotion with bronzers to get darker. It doesn&#x27;t smell like coconuts at all which disappointed me because that was one of the main reasons I wanted to try this. It smells like vanilla. Also there is no smell after you tan, you just smell like hot skin which I do not like. It does leave your skin soft and smooth though.</li>
    <li> Like all other reviews, it has a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;I did not see any GREAT change in colour... I actually saw zero change in colour.&lt;br /&gt;There was no golden tone to my skin, it did not &amp;#34;enhance&amp;#34; my ability to be darker or tan faster.&lt;br /&gt;I will however say that this lotion does work as a nice after sun lotion and the smell is nice enough to be worn as a regular lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I went in with too high of hopes for this product, but it really does not live up to the tanning hype.</li>
    <li> As many &#x27;tanning&#x27; lotions on the shelves today seem to be mostly just &#x27;glorified&#x27; hand lotion !!! ...This product has ingredients &#x27;conducive for tanning&#x27; ... with  added &#x27;benifits&#x27; for the skin.... smooths, softens and moisturizes.... A tanning lotion ...no oily mess ... creamy easy application with the most satisfying results....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking time to  &#x27;read and understand&#x27; the product label as I did on &#x27;Coconut Kisses&#x27; it gave me just what I was looking and hoping for...a natural  Golden Tan...it did what it said and I got what I wanted... at last .... A Great Tan !!!</li>
    <li> I live in Alaska, so I only get some sun a couple short months outta the year.  I love this lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t smell as much like Coconut like I thought it would, it smells more like Vanilla, but nonetheless, it smells GREAT!  It has no cosmetic bronzers in it that make you THINK you tanned well, when in reality your tan washes off a few days later.  Instead, it browns your skin using your own melanin and I have not changed a single shower routine since I used it and I still look brown.  MUST TRY (:</li>
    <li> Great product and price. Absolutely loved it!</li>
    <li> smells great. nice even tanning.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and WORKS! It a by far my fave lotion so far. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying another one for awhile.</li>
    <li> The expiration date of this product is 11/25/04? That is incredible!</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful. It smells like heaven and goes on great. Plus, my tan was gorgeous.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!  Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Love this! And unlike most lotions, this one smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Smells nice, but my skin would always tan better on the days I went to the tanning bed without any tanning lotion. They say clean skin tans better, and I have come to the conclusion that it truly does, for me at least. If you happen to be a tanning lotion believer and want a great smelling tanning lotion this would be the one. It smells great, but it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! I saw almost instant results after using this in a high power bed. This is definitely my new go to lotion when trying to get more color!! I also like knowing it helps cellulite :p</li>
    <li> Smells like I&#x27;m on vacation.  Great lotion.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love the smell! Nice color to my skin after using!</li>
    <li> makes your body feel great only used a few times and can see a difference. Great Product and shipped fast</li>
    <li> Love this! Love the smell, and the results!</li>
    <li> Works great, I noticed a visible different even after the first tanning session.  Doesn&#x27;t small like coconut though, more like vanilla.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t really smell like coconut to me, and I didn&#x27;t notice any huge difference in color when using it.  It is OK but I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fair-skinned redhead who, for the first time ever, decided to try tanning this season. I tried this out because I love the smell of coconut, but holy wow did I get dark! Even the (very experienced) ladies at my salon were shocked at how dark and quickly I tanned. The best part is that, despite having a natural yellow-ish skin-tone, I never looked orange. I haven&#x27;t tanned in three months, and I still have a little glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great. It glides on like silk. It isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky. I will definitely buy more next season!</li>
    <li> You know the smell of your skin after tanning? I&#x27;ve always HATED that - but this is the first lotion I&#x27;ve ever used that I don&#x27;t get that weird smell with! My skin smells like coconuts after tanning and I love it. Highly recommended - would be again.. and again!</li>
    <li> I tan all the time, so I was wanting this to work better than it did. It smells great which I like, because I can tan and still do things in town I need to do. With that being said I have not seen the color I want from this product.:(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d buy this again .. It was okay..</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It smells amazing, just like a day on the beach, and it gets me dark. Also the sweet cocnut and vanilla smell stays on me long after I am done tanning.</li>
    <li> Loved it! Scent was amazing.</li>
    <li> Awesome couldn&#x27;t believe how cheap I got it too, they were selling it for $60 at my tanning salon! It gives you very even tone and is an incredible moisturizer. Plus it smells great!</li>
    <li> Fantastic no bronzer product. Great moisture for skin included in the tanning process.</li>
    <li> I look so pretty in the golden tanning lotion  I love it  I will by more</li>
    <li> Not so much of a coconut smell but more vanilla.</li>
    <li> Works well, love my tan!</li>
    <li> It arrived on time, smells great, goes on smooth and leaves you feeling soft. My new favorite...</li>
    <li> This lotion smells amazing! Even after tanning! I would wear it even if I didnt tan! I only gave it four stars because its not as thick as the lotions I buy from the salon.</li>
    <li> My new favorite lotion, it smells amazing and gives fantastic results! I would highly recommend this to anyone that wants a good looking tan.</li>
    <li> Would y&#x27;all recommend this lotion over the designer skin Phoenician? I&#x27;m wanting to try one of the two, but don&#x27;t know what one to try. Please help and thanks!</li>
    <li> i love this lotion a lot i just  feel since I&#x27;ve used it to much i want something new now. but great smell, doesn&#x27;t tingle or hurt. also it&#x27;ll get you tan</li>
    <li> Smells great! No fake tanner smell at all! Smells light and tropical! It made my skin super soft too!</li>
    <li> Smells great and goes on smooth. No residue.</li>
    <li> Gave me some kind of crazy rash the first time I used it. Never put it on again. I don&#x27;t recommend. I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> As an experienced tanner I started using this because my boyfriend couldn&#x27;t stand the tingle lotion I was using because it highly irritated his skin, so he couldn&#x27;t touch me after tanning. I always believed I got a better and deeper tan with tingle but ed hardy coconut kisses has surprised me with deep, rich, hydrated color! I will always keep this lotion in my rotation :)</li>
    <li> Smells lovely!!! And super fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> Repeat buyer! LOVE this stuff....just as a body lotion! Smells divine!!</li>
    <li> I like this lotion for when u first start tanning. It helps you get a deep dark real Tan look. No orange look! I would recommend this for anyone that is just starting their yearly tanning sessions. It also smells really good an it&#x27;s not super strong.</li>
    <li> really like this product.</li>
    <li> Saw amazing color after the 1st time I used it. Worked in a tanning salon for 5 years and this is probably one of my favorite lotions. Also very moisturizing and smells great</li>
    <li> Excellent results.  I love this lotion and will order it again. I tan very often and my skin looks smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> Smell isn&#x27;t amazing lotion is nice however</li>
    <li> smells great, also gives a nice color while indoor tanning</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Great price!!! I received my order quickly!!!</li>
    <li> Has a vanilla smell which is nice. Didn&#x27;t want to smell straight off the beach leaving the tanning salon. Really don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s done much for me though. I&#x27;ve used it about 5-6 times and already I find I&#x27;m ready to move on to something stronger just not seeing the results I expected. And I tan easy. I gave two stars cause it smells nice, goes on easy and the bottle is not decorated tacky like half the garbage that&#x27;s out there right now. I can appreciate that.</li>
    <li> The lotion is awesome! ... But, they charged me an additional charge of $8 and something that was not disclosed on the payment page.  Little disappointed in that.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the FIRST lotion that I have EVER gotten INSTANT RESULTS with! It&#x27;s very moisturizing, and the smell is not over whelming (it&#x27;s smells more like vanilla than coconut), but it still smells nice! The only disappointment for me was the fact that I LOVE COCONUT and I really wanted it to smell like it! Other than that, I HIGHLY recommend this lotion!</li>
    <li> I use it every day and I have a beautiful tan and it smells great!!!Would definitely order it again as it is way cheaper on Amazon versus buying it in a salon...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been my first couple of times tanning and this is the first tanning lotion that I have used and I love it!! It soaks in and smells amazing. It does give more of a golden color for me since I&#x27;m really pale. But it works great, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy any other brand</li>
    <li> I love this lotion makes you smell so good after tanning and leaves you dark ! Love love love it !!:)</li>
    <li> I have tried this in multiple tanning bed types and i personally would not recommend this lotion.  I did not see results and for my skin that is hard to do. I have medium skin tone and family genes that are naturally tanned skin and i see results going in sun or a tanning bed within 5 minutes.  So for this lotion not to do a thing i wont be using the whole bottle.</li>
    <li> Excellent and I recieved product before schedule date</li>
    <li> Nice smell that isn&#x27;t super perfumey! Yay! Noticed color after first session. Feels very nice on skin.  Almost perfect but not as good as the old Devoted Code tanning lotion I used to get at the salon but this is the next best thing so far that I have tried.</li>
    <li> Has a great smell keeps a nice glow going</li>
    <li> This lotion smells wonderful. It is a tad watery but I would surely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent price for a name brand product! The smell was nice although I like coconut a lot and the smell did linger after tanning, but I don&#x27;t mine after tan smell as long as I smell good!! I felt I got a nice tan with this, and I was hesitant as this was my first Ed H. product. Will experiment more with this line.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel andit doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and the nice color it gives. Very happy with product</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  It has more of a lite vanilla scent than coconut scent to me, which is a nice change. This lotion is thick and spreads easily on my skin, leaving a nice soft feeling. I use this as my regular body lotion after sunning, because no big difference was noticed while trying to tan. But still a very nice lotion.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this product. Didn&#x27;t leave any streaks on my body or in between my fingers. Gave me a great tan!</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion because I&#x27;m really picky about the smell of tanning lotion. I had hoped it would smell more like coconut and not so much vanilla but it still smells good. I like the fact that the lotion has the tattoo color fade protector built in which really has helped to keep my tattoos bright.</li>
    <li> I am super fond of Ed Hardy tanning lotions. But this is not one of them. Does this lotion smell great heck yes it does. But it leaves me with no moisturise at all!!! I have to have a good moisturizer I my tanning lotion cause tanning dries you out so bad. Ed Hardy has some badass lotions too. Ghost Skull, Body Shots! Both some of my favorite. There are plenty that are much better. So save you money on this one. It smell ls nice but does not really do anything for your tan or skin!!</li>
    <li> Not real crazy about the smell!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great,  moisturizes great,  not as dark as a tingle but pretty close</li>
    <li> Bought it for me but my daughter quickly made it hers.</li>
    <li> Love this smells good tanning is good too</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS TANNING LOTION IT SMELLS JUST LIKE COCONUTS AND IT TANS GREAT IF U LOVE TO TAN WITH GREAT SMELL AND AWESOME RESULTS :) TRY THIS</li>
    <li> Feels good, smells good and last a long time!</li>
    <li> The Ed Hardy Coconut Kisses golden tanning lotion is smooth on my skin. It absorbs fast so I don&#x27;t feel slimmy or sticky. It also &amp;#34;cooks&amp;#34; well. Meaning that after I tan I don&#x27;t smell stinky or burnt, like with other lotions. I can actually tan and than go somewhere without anyone noticing. This is nice because before I would have to shower after tanning.</li>
    <li> This lotion does not have a bronzer. I used this for after I got a base tan using the Anything goes lotion. It works great! Get a lot of compliments on the smell afterwards too!</li>
    <li> The aroma is just as expected, coconut. If you like that fragrance you will love this. Plus, it does not have that funky smell after tanning. Leaves skin ultra soft.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Leaves my skin feeling soft after tanning without the typical lotion smell!</li>
    <li> Nice application. Nice fragrance. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t have bronzer so I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hands turning brown. This lotion is really good and helps gradually create a tan. Definitely has better results in a tanning salon than actual sunlight. I havent noticed fading of my tattoo, but that&#x27;s because I put spf 50 tattoo suncreen on it. I recommend this product, it does its job to create a natural glow.</li>
    <li> this smells pretty good.. not as good as all the reviews but still pretty good:) and it makes me tanner:) so all in all Good enough for 4 Stars!</li>
    <li> The lotion had clumps in it that turned into balls in a tanning booth</li>
    <li> Creamy lotion, lovely scent. Price is right. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells awesome and builds a nice natural looking tan :)</li>
    <li> Smells great! I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but it smells very good when you first put in on and leaves a good bronze but the smell after tanning isn&#x27;t any better then most lotions.</li>
    <li> this lotion got me darker than ever in just two or three visits- broke my tannign plateau!  well worth it!</li>
    <li> Great product very satisfied.makes my skin silky will definitely order again</li>
    <li> Works good, have used 2 bottles. My husband noticed a huge difference in how dark I had gotten.</li>
    <li> OMG! I just bought a three-month tanning package that I probably won&#x27;t even get full advantage of because I am just one big freckle when I tan meaning I tan brown and I tan fast. I never even buy a lotion other than the quick (much cheaper) packets, but I am getting older now and this lotion packet boasted of the anti-aging protection it provided, and I am obsessed with anything coconut right now, so I tried it. I am now waiting for a whole bottle I ordered today on Amazon! It is so amazing! I was a deep bronze brown afterwards after only 7 minutes in a ten-minute stand-up bed, and we are talking my SECOND session!!!! Super soft skin and no fried skin cell smell! I am still ROCKIN a great tan even on my face, and it has been a week :-) this is the KIND! Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It soaks in fast, It smells like delicious coconut vanilla. I really like that it has no bronzer in it, it turned me a shade darker when I did 8 minutes in a 9 minute stand up. It would take me 4 hrs in the sun to get a tan so that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t make me super dark. It&#x27;s not bad at all, I&#x27;m sure within the 2nd time I&#x27;ll get darker. Also, I did have a base tan when I tried it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this tanning lotion. :)  It works just like it says. And I am tanning fast with it! Not to mention, it smells good.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning this month to get ready for an upcoming vacation.  This product smells great and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin from drying out.</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion by far. Got a dark tan within a few visits to the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> Great lotion; leaves skin soft and it creates a nice tanning. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference  when I do and don&#x27;t use it. I do love the smell.</li>
    <li> Oh my. I love the smell so much. It smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Worked great an has an AMAZING smell (if you like coconut)!  Will definitely use again!</li>
    <li> Such a great lotion!! I love it so much and will not be changing products:)</li>
    <li> Pleasant scent compared to most Designer Skin products I&#x27;ve used. I already have used bronzers prior to using this product and so I&#x27;m merely maintaining my tan. works well in that manner but I can&#x27;t say for sure I would&#x27;ve had the same effects had I not used bronzers to build up to where I am. I tried this product because I question the healthfulness of designer skin products and wanted to try something new.</li>
    <li> Smells good... Not a runny lotion.</li>
    <li> My favourite. Smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Smells really good and leaves your skin super soft. Also love that you don&#x27;t smell like burnt skin when you&#x27;re done tanning. Don&#x27;t think it gets you very dark because I use Smile! You&#x27;re darker and notice way more of a difference with that than this Ed Hardy lotion. Its okay but wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This has got to be my favorite lotion so light but definetaly works.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, I only tan a few months in the spring. Smells great and no tingle and no orange stains when done! Worth the money!</li>
    <li> Very nice lotion... Smells great and leaves skin soft!!</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion smells amazing! I love the way it applies to the skin. There isn&#x27;t one thing I dislike about this product! I love it!</li>
    <li> Great product, doesn&#x27;t leasve you feeling greasy</li>
