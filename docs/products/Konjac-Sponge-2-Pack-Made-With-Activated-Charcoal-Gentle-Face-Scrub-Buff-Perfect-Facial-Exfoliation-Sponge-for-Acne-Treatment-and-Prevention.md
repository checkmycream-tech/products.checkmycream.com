      <li>This is a 2 pack and the way it is packaged is absolutely adorable!</li>
      <li>Once I was finished and used my vitamin C serum, my face felt and looked amazing.</li>
      <li>It felt so amazing against my skin.  </li>
      <li>I read the directions and you are to soften it under running warm water.  </li>
      <li>I did receive this product at discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
      <li>This sponge was offered to me at a discount in exchange for my honest review</li>
      <li>I used my favorite cleanser on the sponge, and exfoliated my skin in circular motions.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s refreshing.</li>
      <li>They are adorable, just have to say.  </li>
      <li>I am glad I decided to give these sponges a go.</li>
      <li>I received the sponges today and one of my favorite things about them is the lovely presentation packaging beyond that</li>
      <li>but I found these to be a bit softer and more gentle on the skin though it does give a very nice cleansing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;*I received this product complimentary in return for my honest review</li>
      <li>I am so impressed by this little sponge.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;There are two in a package - you could be greedy like me and keep both or give one to your friend so they can enjoy as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I loved the fact that this is a 100% all natural spong and the fact that the packaging is safer for the environment.</li>
      <li>They are packaged separately and would actually make for a very nice gift.</li>
      <li>Makes my face feel smoother and clean.</li>
      <li>Fun and easy and compact.</li>
      <li>and my skin feel comfortably clean.</li>
      <li>I like using the sponge to clean my face twice a week.</li>
      <li>sponge is the perfect size to use a small circular motion to gently massage and clean your face with your favorite cleanser.</li>
      <li>They are so lovely and definitely some of my favorite compared to others on the market.</li>
      <li>It smells very strongly like an old fashioned home permanent, and the odor stuck around even after repeated rinsing.</li>
      <li>Simply soaking one sponge in some warm water will soften the sponge up quite nicely.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I set one of the sponges in a warm dish of water and allowed about six minutes to pass to allow the sponge to open and soften for use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a softer feeling than the Puresol brand, and feels more like a &#x27;buff&#x27; than a scrub.&lt;br /&gt;Still a nice feeling, does the same for my faces as the puresol in terms of brightness and overall feeling of the skin, just lacks</li>
      <li>Highly recommended whether you have skin conditions or not!!</li>
      <li>My friend has acne and oily skin, and now she really likes this product!</li>
      <li>These are fantastic Konjac sponges, naturally made.</li>
      <li>I loved this feeling, it was renewing and almost like a shedding of dead skin.</li>
      <li>but I love the way my skin feels and it didn&#x27;t make my face dry after I used it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d use it more, but it takes forever to dry in between washes.</li>
      <li>I also used this on my very dry flaky lips, they were smooth within seconds!</li>
      <li>/&gt;First of all, the packaging is so eco-friendly and it comes with two Konjac sponges in their own little boxes.  </li>
      <li>It truly left my face feeling smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I cleaned my entire face and did not want to stop because it just felt so fantastic.  </li>
      <li>and I really wanted to see what the hype was about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I started the process and it really did not take but</li>
      <li>Straight out of the box</li>
      <li>I really recommend this product.</li>
      <li>You will notice a big difference in your face, more of a natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It, also, has this great little string for hanging up to dry.</li>
      <li>That was so cool to see, I just soaked it and left it for about 5-10 minutes</li>
      <li>Soft but feel like they are really scrubbing!</li>
      <li>Compared to PureSol (which is the only comparison I have), these have a much denser feel, more of a sphere shape and smaller pores in the material.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a different kind of loafa sponge, but once it&#x27;s wet, it&#x27;s not like a loafa anymore.</li>
      <li>I was also quite surprised at how &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; it puffed up!</li>
      <li>In terms of quality these are pretty similar in some ways to others</li>
      <li>/&gt;After getting the sponge soft, I put it to the test.  </li>
      <li>Taking your first look at these little sponges you would not think they were made for the fast.</li>
      <li>While they look hard and you would think they hurt your skin, it could not be more the opposite.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> feels so good to wash my face with these! Soft but feel like they are really scrubbing!</li>
    <li> Taking your first look at these little sponges you would not think they were made for the fast. Upon taking them out of the packaging they look like pieces of charcoal you would take out of the grill! However, I am one who will try just about anything once, so it was time to hit my face up with some charcoal. While they look hard and you would think they hurt your skin, it could not be more the opposite. Simply soaking one sponge in some warm water will soften the sponge up quite nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge is the perfect size to use a small circular motion to gently massage and clean your face with your favorite cleanser. I loved the fact that this is a 100% all natural spong and the fact that the packaging is safer for the environment. You will notice a big difference in your face, more of a natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two in a package - you could be greedy like me and keep both or give one to your friend so they can enjoy as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It was a bit weird at first but I love the way my skin feels and it didn&#x27;t make my face dry after I used it. I am glad I decided to give these sponges a go.</li>
    <li> I received the sponges today and one of my favorite things about them is the lovely presentation packaging beyond that I tried one immediately as I had been at the beach for a few hours and felt especially grimy. I started cleaning my skin with Tatcha cleansing oil and then I popped in the shower and completed the face cleaning with this little gem on a thread and my skin feel comfortably clean.</li>
    <li> I like it.  It&#x27;s a different kind of loafa sponge, but once it&#x27;s wet, it&#x27;s not like a loafa anymore.</li>
    <li> Great sponges. Have a little string to hand these by and the size/shape is perfect. I&#x27;m glad it comes in a 2 pack!</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel smoother and clean. I really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It is what it says it is but it isn&#x27;t textured enough for exfoliating</li>
    <li> Compared to PureSol (which is the only comparison I have), these have a much denser feel, more of a sphere shape and smaller pores in the material. It&#x27;s a softer feeling than the Puresol brand, and feels more like a &#x27;buff&#x27; than a scrub.&lt;br /&gt;Still a nice feeling, does the same for my faces as the puresol in terms of brightness and overall feeling of the skin, just lacks the other all scrubby feeling that&#x27;s refreshing. All in all though, a tight choice between the two. Just depends on what you prefer.</li>
    <li> I have never seen a sponge this this before and I was so curious to try it out.  Activated charcoal is starting to make it&#x27;s mark all across the board of beauty products.  This sponge was offered to me at a discount in exchange for my honest review and I really wanted to see what the hype was about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the packaging is so eco-friendly and it comes with two Konjac sponges in their own little boxes.  They are adorable, just have to say.  Straight out of the box I feel like I am clueless to what I am doing with this hard little sponge.  I read the directions and you are to soften it under running warm water.  I started the process and it really did not take but maybe a minute to bring it to a soft and supple little sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting the sponge soft, I put it to the test.  It felt so amazing against my skin.  No chemicals burning or drying out my skin.  I cleaned my entire face and did not want to stop because it just felt so fantastic.  It truly left my face feeling smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It, also, has this great little string for hanging up to dry. I am so impressed by this little sponge.  Highly recommended whether you have skin conditions or not!!</li>

I use this daily(usually in the mornings) and my skin has been looking great! I was also quite surprised at how &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; it puffed up! That was so cool to see, I just soaked it and left it for about 5-10 minutes and bam it was like a giant bon bon or mochi ice cream or even a cream puff. I would definitely recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product complimentary in return for my honest review*</li>
    <li> I have bought other charcoal infused konjac sponges, and none of them have smelled like this. It smells very strongly like an old fashioned home permanent, and the odor stuck around even after repeated rinsing. Other than that, it worked like any other konjac sponge.</li>

I used my favorite cleanser on the sponge, and exfoliated my skin in circular motions. I loved this feeling, it was renewing and almost like a shedding of dead skin. Once I was finished and used my vitamin C serum, my face felt and looked amazing. These sponges can be used for at least a month&#x27;s time period, and definitely worth the investment based on the quality and conclusion of how it worked for me. I did receive this product at discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> These are the neatest little sponges and seem to do the trick in making your skin smoother .</li>
    <li> I like using the sponge to clean my face twice a week. I&#x27;d use it more, but it takes forever to dry in between washes. It&#x27;s not as rough as I expected it would be. So if you are looking for something that SCRUBS, look elsewhere.</li>
