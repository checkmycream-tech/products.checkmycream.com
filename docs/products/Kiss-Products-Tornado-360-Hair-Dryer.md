### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>LOVE IT!!!!</li>
      <li>The ad sounded wonderful.  </li>
      <li>impressive on how they come up with this mechanism.</li>
      <li>Would have been a great dryer</li>
      <li>I would&#x27;ve been happy with a Conair Ionic hairdryer.</li>
      <li>It works great and it takes one to two turns on the brush with each section.</li>
      <li>Works great.  </li>
      <li>I love this dryer - perhaps one of the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>During those 2 weeks I loved it.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price for a good blow dryer</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good dryer.</li>
      <li>I love this blowdryer!</li>
      <li>However, I dropped it by mistake and there went the tornado portion which is a really nice enhancement and creates lots of volume.</li>
      <li>It worked great for two weeks; then, it got extremely hot while running and started smoking.  </li>
      <li>totally love this.</li>
      <li>so now I no longer have the hair dryer that I love</li>
      <li>so I am glad I got it.</li>
      <li>Love love love it</li>
      <li>and I just love this.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>This dryer gave me lots of volume but smooth and shiny!  </li>
      <li>The tornado attachment is ingenious and what makes this product stand out from all the others I considered before making my purchase.</li>
      <li>It no longer is safe to use</li>
      <li>Quick and very easy to use</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t see what is so special about it.</li>
      <li>It is not faster drying and leaves great bunch of wet hair</li>
      <li>It is a big piece of equipment, something that isn&#x27;t good for the job it has to do.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have believed that, but it&#x27;s true.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a cool concept, but the power is lacking.</li>
      <li>I own another hair dryer but it is really old</li>
      <li>The dilivery was quick and no problem ordering or receiving.  </li>
      <li>This does the job in less time and that makes me happy.</li>
      <li>I would definitely get this again, I love it!</li>
      <li>If it stays in good condition for a decent amount of time, I will definitely buy another &amp; recommend it to all my friends!</li>
      <li>That will be the true test...whether it can last for more than a year.</li>
      <li>My hair sticks straight out and is super frizzy after I use this dryer.</li>
      <li>Someone even asked me if I had just been to the salon after using it for one of the first times.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different dryers in an attempt to shorten drying time.  </li>
      <li>The tornado attachment was interesting and I wouldn&#x27;t have had an issue with it if the dryer actually did much of anything.  </li>
      <li>I have very long wavy hair and with this tool I am able to make it look straight and neat!</li>
      <li>The high setting feels more like a low setting.  </li>
      <li>Apparently, the ceramic/ionic did not make much of a difference, as it did not leave my hair smooth and frizz</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s much quicker and easier.</li>
      <li>Better than expected.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy this product  immensely since its easier to manage</li>
      <li>Really.  </li>
      <li>Am very</li>
      <li>I enjoy especially the insert that spins the air.</li>
      <li>I was able to style with a round brush.  </li>
      <li>but it still dry&#x27;s my hair amazingly quick.</li>
      <li>This hair dryer is VERY loud.</li>
      <li>It seems to do exactly what it says and definitely reduces drying time.</li>
      <li>The high setting doesn&#x27;t seem fast enough for my liking either.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d give it a 5 if it actually felt like 1875 watts feels more like 1100 or less even without the attachment</li>
      <li>I was afraid my hair might tangle more easily with the tornado action</li>
      <li>This is a Christmas gift, so as it is only November, I can&#x27;t really tell you how it works.  </li>
      <li>The results are quick and long lasting.</li>
      <li>I have had very high end blowdryers like T3, Sultra, elchim to name a few and this one is just as good if not better at only a fraction if the price!</li>
      <li>Not powerful enough for even fine hair.  </li>
      <li>With this new hair dryer, not only does it save time</li>
      <li>It was replaced immediately then a couple months later my daughter needed a hair dryer I gave her mine because I received a new one for Christmas but two months after using it the toggle switch broke</li>
      <li>Well I&#x27;m back to using the old one.</li>
      <li>I hope the dryer continues to work as well as it has so far &amp; will last me a while.</li>
      <li>Ive never used anything like it before but am finally able to thoroughly dry those reaaly hard to reach places.</li>
      <li>Only complaint is that it&#x27;s kind of heavy.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have to move my arms up and down so much in order</li>
      <li>my thick hair dries up so quick</li>
      <li>I like to wear it straight, but this just made a mess of it.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t figure out why one worked great and the other failed in less than two weeks.  </li>

<li> The trick is the tornado attachment which dries in a circular motion rather than the usual straight one.  </li>
<li> and I hope the dryer will be around for a long time!  </li>
<li> Then I put the concentrator on and blow dry section by section.</li>
<li> I do dry my hair every day.  </li>
<li> unfortunately the company wants me to pay for the shipping to send back which is over $15 I should not have to pay for shipping on something to be returned back that was defective and still under warranty</li>
<li> I figured out how to put it back together but was missing a screw.</li>
<li> It took less than 5 minutes to dry and then using the other attachment</li>
<li> I have long hair that usually takes forever to dry but not with this hairdryer with the tornado attachment.  </li>
<li> but the hassle of re-packing and losing $8 or $10 for return shipping it just not worth it.  </li>
<li> I can blow out my thin long hair and style it with a  big round brush in less than 4 minutes.</li>
<li> In the past I wouldn&#x27;t bother with the round brush because it would take too long now</li>
<li> Its just a typical hairdryer.</li>
<li> My only complaint, which is a small one, is that the handle is a bit wide for my hands and can get a little heavy after holding it for a while.</li>
<li> Power is stronger on the cold setting, and lessens when you set it to hot.  </li>
<li> I bought the red color on this hair dryer because I was tired of always buying black.  </li>
<li> get my hair dried.  </li>
<li> but my hair is softer and less oily!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure why, I&#x27;ve never had this happen before.</li>
<li> but when I opened the box the tornado attachment was broken.</li>
<li> Has all the power and the tornado attachment drys the air without needless moving around of the dryer.</li>
<li> An extreme disappointment and another one goes to the junk pile!!!</li>
<li> That part drives me crazy.</li>
<li> I use the hair dryer without any attachments because when I put the tornado attachment on, it snarls and knots my hair so bad, I had to cut pieces of my hair because they were badly snarled.</li>
<li> Disappointed.  </li>

    <li> Love love love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update my hair dyer caught on fire. It was replaced immediately then a couple months later my daughter needed a hair dryer I gave her mine because I received a new one for Christmas but two months after using it the toggle switch broke and it cannot be used unfortunately the company wants me to pay for the shipping to send back which is over $15 I should not have to pay for shipping on something to be returned back that was defective and still under warranty so now I no longer have the hair dryer that I love</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is VERY loud. it&#x27;s truly like you&#x27;re in a tornado. Louder than any dryer I&#x27;ve ever had. Also, it makes my hair frizzy. I&#x27;m not sure why, I&#x27;ve never had this happen before. I own another hair dryer but it is really old so I decided to purchase this one. Well I&#x27;m back to using the old one. My hair sticks straight out and is super frizzy after I use this dryer. It I still had the box, I would return it.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Better than expected.  Has all the power and the tornado attachment drys the air without needless moving around of the dryer.</li>
    <li> This dryer dries my hair in a flash!  The trick is the tornado attachment which dries in a circular motion rather than the usual straight one.  Whoever designed this attachment was genius and I hope the dryer will be around for a long time!  I now look forward to drying and styling my hair!</li>
    <li> All this does is tangle u hair and make it frizzy.  It is not faster drying and leaves great bunch of wet hair underneath.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this item to anyone.  Am very I did not return it immediately.</li>
    <li> This does the job in less time and that makes me happy. I would recommend this to anyone. Quick and very easy to use</li>
    <li> Not powerful enough for even fine hair.  Really.  I wouldn&#x27;t have believed that, but it&#x27;s true.  Instead of drying faster, as it advertises, it dries slower, even on the high/hot setting.  The tornado attachment was interesting and I wouldn&#x27;t have had an issue with it if the dryer actually did much of anything.  Power is stronger on the cold setting, and lessens when you set it to hot.  Apparently, the ceramic/ionic did not make much of a difference, as it did not leave my hair smooth and frizz-less - I was left with the same old flyaways I always get from blow dryers.  Disappointed.  I sent it back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the hair dryer for about 2 months now and no problems yet. It seems to do exactly what it says and definitely reduces drying time. The tornado attachment is ingenious and what makes this product stand out from all the others I considered before making my purchase. Ive never used anything like it before but am finally able to thoroughly dry those reaaly hard to reach places. I have always had oily hair and if I dont use a hair dryer, I might as well have not even bothered with he shower at all, it would still look oily! I was afraid my hair might tangle more easily with the tornado action but I have not noticed this to be the case. With this new hair dryer, not only does it save time but my hair is softer and less oily! Someone even asked me if I had just been to the salon after using it for one of the first times. I have a disability that makes standing for long periods of time difficult &amp; with this hair dryer, I&#x27;m able to reduce that time. My only complaint, which is a small one, is that the handle is a bit wide for my hands and can get a little heavy after holding it for a while. I hope the dryer continues to work as well as it has so far &amp; will last me a while. If it stays in good condition for a decent amount of time, I will definitely buy another &amp; recommend it to all my friends!</li>
    <li> Would have been a great dryer but when I opened the box the tornado attachment was broken. I figured out how to put it back together but was missing a screw. So it ended up breaking again 2 weeks later. During those 2 weeks I loved it. Didn&#x27;t feel the need to shake my hand. Even without it it&#x27;s a good dryer. Only complaint is that it&#x27;s kind of heavy. I f you can get it in one piece I&#x27;d recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> I use the hair dryer without any attachments because when I put the tornado attachment on, it snarls and knots my hair so bad, I had to cut pieces of my hair because they were badly snarled. The high setting doesn&#x27;t seem fast enough for my liking either. I would&#x27;ve been happy with a Conair Ionic hairdryer.</li>
    <li> OMG!  I have long hair that usually takes forever to dry but not with this hairdryer with the tornado attachment.  It took less than 5 minutes to dry and then using the other attachment I was able to style with a round brush.  This dryer gave me lots of volume but smooth and shiny!  I hope it lasts.  I do dry my hair every day.  That will be the true test...whether it can last for more than a year. I would definitely recommend this hairdryer.</li>
    <li> This is a Christmas gift, so as it is only November, I can&#x27;t really tell you how it works.  I will update after we give this to our daughter-in-law and she uses it on herself and daughter.  The ad sounded wonderful.  We are hoping it is.</li>
    <li> Saw this written up as a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; in a magazine. I have used it once and I don&#x27;t see what is so special about it. I think it lacks the force that a hair dryer this size should have. It is a big piece of equipment, something that isn&#x27;t good for the job it has to do.</li>
    <li> I bought the red color on this hair dryer because I was tired of always buying black.  I enjoy this product  immensely since its easier to manage and I don&#x27;t have to move my arms up and down so much in order get my hair dried.  I enjoy especially the insert that spins the air.</li>
    <li> Got it for the gadget. The &amp;#34;tornado&amp;#34; piece came apart within days. Its just a typical hairdryer. Could have got anything.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cool concept, but the power is lacking. The high setting feels more like a low setting.  That part drives me crazy.</li>
    <li> All it did was blow my hair all over the place.  I like to wear it straight, but this just made a mess of it.</li>
    <li> wife loves it. recommends it to every one</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price for a good blow dryer</li>
    <li> I bought one for myself from WalMart for Christmas; so, I decided to order one for my sister.  It worked great for two weeks; then, it got extremely hot while running and started smoking.  It no longer is safe to use but the hassle of re-packing and losing $8 or $10 for return shipping it just not worth it.  Can&#x27;t figure out why one worked great and the other failed in less than two weeks.  An extreme disappointment and another one goes to the junk pile!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!! I&#x27;d give it a 5 if it actually felt like 1875 watts feels more like 1100 or less even without the attachment but it still dry&#x27;s my hair amazingly quick. I can blow out my thin long hair and style it with a  big round brush in less than 4 minutes. It works great and it takes one to two turns on the brush with each section. In the past I wouldn&#x27;t bother with the round brush because it would take too long now it&#x27;s much quicker and easier. I would definitely recommend this. I also wouldn&#x27;t have seen it or bought it if the wattage was printed as lower so I am glad I got it.</li>
    <li> I love this blowdryer! I have had very high end blowdryers like T3, Sultra, elchim to name a few and this one is just as good if not better at only a fraction if the price! I start off with the tornado feature and blowdry all over. Then I put the concentrator on and blow dry section by section. The results are quick and long lasting. I have very long wavy hair and with this tool I am able to make it look straight and neat!</li>
    <li> my thick hair dries up so quick and I just love this.&lt;br /&gt;Very impressive on how they come up with this mechanism.</li>
    <li> totally love this. bought two, one for myself and one for my daughter. it shortens our hair drying time dramatically!</li>
    <li> I love this dryer - perhaps one of the best I&#x27;ve used.  Especially with the Tornado attachment.  However, I dropped it by mistake and there went the tornado portion which is a really nice enhancement and creates lots of volume.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different dryers in an attempt to shorten drying time.  I have been amazed that my drying time was reduced by several minutes - at 5:00 a.m. every minute faster counts!  I would definitely get this again, I love it!</li>
    <li> The product meets my satisfaction quota.  The dilivery was quick and no problem ordering or receiving.  I like the hair dryer because it is lightweight and has a couple of attachments to aid in drying and stying.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
