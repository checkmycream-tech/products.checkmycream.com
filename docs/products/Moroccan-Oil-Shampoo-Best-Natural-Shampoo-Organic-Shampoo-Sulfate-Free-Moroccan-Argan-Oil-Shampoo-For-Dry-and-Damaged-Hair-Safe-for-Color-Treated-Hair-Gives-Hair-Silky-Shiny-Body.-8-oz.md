<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Do not buy the shampoo it strips your hair it left my hair like straw smells great but works terrible</li>
    <li> I have been using the Tru Moroccan shampoo and conditioner for a few weeks now and I am very pleased with them both.  I have fine hair and sometimes it falls flat, so I was worried that the argan oil would weigh my hair down.  But so far that has not been the case.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser that also provides some moisturizing and shine to my hair.  But what I like best is the more natural ingredients it contains, there are less chemicals than other shampoos.  The scent is fruity and smells nice without aggravating my allergies.  It doesn&#x27;t lather up as much as other shampoos but I realize that is because there are less foaming chemicals.  Most of the natural shampoos lather less than average.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service has also been very kind and helpful.  I would recommend this shampoo and also the conditioner to anyone looking for natural hair care with moisturizer and shine.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for review purposes and I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smelled funny and made my hair dry after washing.</li>
    <li> Shampoo wasn&#x27;t that great but conditioner was....</li>
    <li> Smells great and is a natural shampoo which I love!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a moisturizing shampoo, it is more of a purifying shampoo. If I didn&#x27;t follow up with the conditioner, my hair would&#x27;ve been a tangled mess. The conditioner by this company is very good though!</li>
    <li> Fist of all let me say that this shampoo smells incredibly good. I love the fact this item is Paraben free and Sulfate free, so I can safely use it after straight my hair at the beauty parlor, flat ironing at home, and so on. The product is thick, so you don&#x27;t need a lot of it; it&#x27;s concentrated.  My hair feels smooth and silky after the use, without any frizz. It makes the hair very easy to manage and style, but at the same time, does not make your scalp oily like some similar products do. I would definitely recommend this item</li>
    <li> This shampoo is very good for dry britlle hair,it leaves my hair soft and not oily, this shampoo is so good that I&#x27;m able to use it every other day,thank you amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the worst shampoo ever.  No suds, no smell, and made my hair feel like horse hair.  Left it dry and frizzy.  Returning</li>
    <li> My hair is usually frizzy and gets to be dry at times from the weather as well as using different styling products daily.  When I used the Tru Moroccan Shampoo I can definitely smell the orange citrus scent, which is so refreshing!  It left a very nice scent on my hair that lasted all day long.  I had to use a lot of the shampoo to be able to cover my whole hair, since I have longer hair.  I also noticed that because this is a natural product there was not much of a lather, but I was more concerned with how well it left my hair. It was shiny and moisturized all day long.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the smell but more importantly, the natural ingredients are what sold me! I am trying to switch from a higher end line due to the cost and this one fits the bill!</li>
    <li> My gray but colored hair is soft and bouncy again!!!</li>
    <li> My hair is very dry and frizzy and I had been purchasing an Argan oil shampoo from my hairdresser which worked well, but the price was outrageous and I couldn&#x27;t continue to buy it. I decided to look for one more reasonable and chose this one and was not disappointed :) .&lt;br /&gt;  I saw a difference in my very first use, I love the light refreshing scent and it worked better then the one I had been purchasing. My hair looked and felt wonderful, shiny and healthy with a major reduction of frizz.&lt;br /&gt;  I will absolutely be back for more :) Thanks so much for a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This product alone will not work for long hair.  It seems to strip your hair of everything and without adding a ton of moisturizer/conditioner you can&#x27;t even get a comb through 1/4 inch of it.  The bottle also came damaged so the pour spout is unusable.  Mainly though, it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel good at all.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally wavy and very oily. My friend recommended I try a promotion in return for a honest opinion. My salon shampoo does a pretty good job at taming my hair, but this organic formula really impressed me. It made my hair silky without the added chemicals. I&#x27;ve told all my friends and they are on the Tru Moroccan team now. Can&#x27;t wait to try your conditioner!</li>
    <li> Tru Moroccan smells so good on my hair keep&#x27;s my scalp healthy looking I&#x27;m so amazed by this product the best I done use so far loving it</li>
    <li> I have jumped on the Argan Oil train and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be getting off any time soon. I was given the opportunity to review this shampoo and I was so excited because:&lt;br /&gt;It is Designed For Hair That&#x27;s Been Weakened Or Damaged By Color And that is me!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect For Dry, Flaky Or Itching Scalp, As Well As Damaged, Weak Hair.&lt;br /&gt;Contains No Parabens, Pabas Or Sulfates and Contains 100% Pure, Organic Argan Oil&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part is that it is Made In The USA!!  What it fails to mention is how wonderful this shampoo makes your hair smell, I feel like I&#x27;m at a spa once I step out of the shower.  I&#x27;m going to purchase the conditioner next, because if it&#x27;s half as good as the Tru Moroccan Shampoo, I need to have it.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is ok.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as silky as the description says it does &amp; definitely is not worth the money (in my opinion).  I have the conditioner as well.  The conditioner is nice but again - I don&#x27;t see a huge difference and for the money ($18+ / bottle) I guess my expectations were set pretty high.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner bottle itself was a downer because the top has a big piece of plastic blocking it from dispensing properly so I have to unscrew the top and force the conditioner out of the bottle instead of just being able to squeeze it out like I can with the shampoo.  Overall, I will use the rest of the product but won&#x27;t waste my money on purchasing more unless it goes down to about $4 / bottle.</li>
    <li> I washed my hair last night with this shampoo and the top of my hair matted together!! My hair has NEVER done this! I had to cut my hair out.. Do not recommend at all.</li>
    <li> I got this product because of the good reviews... I don&#x27;t know why people like it. It made my hair way too oily, and I have dry hair!</li>
    <li> Love the smell. I went to my hairstylist and she is using these products too so can&#x27;t go wrong. It is a little pricey and it takes a lot to lather, however, I&#x27;ve noticed my hair stays feeling clean and not greasy for about 3 days . I will buy it again .</li>
    <li> I do not like this stuff.  I have curly hair (3c/3b), and this doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with a clean or a moisturized feeling.  I want to feel very clean and non greasy, or a shampoo that moisturizes and cleanses.  This does not create suds, but that is fine - I have used other shampoos like this, but this doesn&#x27;t clean my hair at all.  Won&#x27;t be buying it again</li>
    <li> after shampooing my hair it was a big mess of tangles and snarls.  I needed to put a lot of the conditioner in to get the comb through.  Would not purchase this product again</li>
    <li> Hope you have super oily hair to use this. Ive never had my hair so tangled up before until using this shampoo</li>
    <li> My wife says her hair is really shiny and soft when she uses this shampoo and it works really well if you also use their conditioner after shampooing your hair.</li>
    <li> Argan oils are rage these days. I was provided a sample for review. Nice packaging/well made. No side effects observed.</li>
    <li> The shampoo turned my hair to straw.  Smells great but you need half a bottle of conditioner to make up for it.  Back to my old shampoo.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this shampoo all that great it didn&#x27;t moisturize well to me so I won&#x27;t order anymore.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was packaged well and was even sent with a nice email from the seller explaining the use and ingredients. I really like this product. It worked great on my hair. I love the way it smells and feels. I noticed that my hair seemed silkier and smoother after washing. It was also easier for me to style my hair after using this. Its truly a great shampoo.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like this product. First, when it arrives the film on cap was glued to cap. I was unable to use the dispenser. I have to open the cap and pour every time. And after using it my hair starts to have lots of scurf that&#x27;s never there before. I absolutely dislike this product and it is a totol waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love this so much! I switched to this because of a sensitivity to traditional shampoo. I still wash my hair as often as before, but my hair is softer, shinier, and somehow curlier. I use the conditioner with it about every other wash, otherwise my hair gets a bit oily. I&#x27;m a big fan and recommend it to anyone I know is looking for a natural alternative.</li>
    <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to give this a try.  Well, so much for for raving reviews from people who received this shampoo for free.  Like all &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos, this one did not lather and even after two applications did not leave my hair feeling clean.  The best shampoo I&#x27;ve found for my thick dyed hair is Morrocanoil&#x27;s.  Their products smell great and deliver on their promises.</li>
    <li> cleans well, doesn&#x27;t dry hair</li>
    <li> Not a fan. Drys my hair right out. Definitely over priced products. I would not suggest this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This did absolutely nothing for my hair. Not worth buying it</li>
    <li> It is expensive but it got the job done and the results were amazing.This is the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, not as moisturizing as I&#x27;d hope...but washing your hair twice you get the lather....</li>
    <li> This did not agree with my hair.  I have Caucasian thick wavy hair and it was not a good fit.  It also made my back and chest break out.</li>
    <li> it is supposed to moisturizing, but feels very drying.</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail today... It&#x27;s pretty pricey for only 8oz of shampoo,specially for me with long coarse hair...I recently did highlights on my entire head &amp; that left my hair very very dry &amp; damaged, I&#x27;ll come back later for an update.</li>
    <li> My hair is dry , so , I bought this shampoo to try and i didn&#x27;t like it.  My hair after this are getting oily and not shiny at all.</li>
    <li> I Love Love Love this.  It makes my hair very soft.  I have wavy hair that likes to frizz and this helps with that.  I don&#x27;t use it every day because I&#x27;m afraid since it is an oil shampoo/conditioner, that it will make my hair look greasy after awhile, but I love it on the days I do use it.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughters curly fine hair demands the gentlest ingredients. I prefer to NOT use anything with Parabens, Pabas Or Sulfates and this Tru Moroccan shampoo does not contain any! Curly hair does well without these ingredients and it shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo smells amazinggggg!!! so so good!! my daughter&#x27;s hair was so easy to brush out after it was washed (we use a wet brush). I even used a little drop as leave in conditioner and it dried so beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is 8 fl oz and if you have medium length hair it should last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is in made in the USA, has no artificial color, no artificial additives, or impurities. AND is NOT tested on animals ...Cruelty Free!!!! No ingredients derived from animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients include 100% Organic Argan Oil, Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Wheat Germ Oil, Vitamin B5, Organic Asparagus, Organic Cilantro, Organic Geranium, Apricot Kernel Oil, Organic Rosemary, Jojoba, Olive Oil, Rose Hip Oil, Tea Tree Oil, Ethylhexyl Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol.</li>
    <li> This product is not for tick or waivy hair, my hair felt very dried even when using both shampoo and conditioner, will not buy again</li>
    <li> This shampoos very well and smells like fresh brewed ice tea, along with a faint citrus scent. I love how easy I can manage my hair and how unbelievably soft it feels after I use this in conjunction with the conditioner! It also seem to help with my dandruff and scalp build up!</li>
    <li> Fantastic shampoo! I am in my mid-70s and have dry , thin hair. This has made my hair much softer and easy to manage. I&#x27;m a convert!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product along with several other items. I love the way that it smells. However I found that it left my hair feeling very hard and stripped which was surprising. I love argan oil products. However my hair is relaxed. I used it on my daughters natural hair and it worked great. I did follow with the Silk 18 conditioner and that definitely helped. I would use again for my daughters but would mix it with a conditioning shampoo for myself. I am really interested in trying the argan oil deep conditioner. All in all, it depends on your hair type. Although I&#x27;ve used other argan oil brands and didn&#x27;t have this issue.</li>
    <li> Liked the shampoo. Looking forward to conditioner coming in a few days. I ordered them separately for some reason. I have thin fine hair and extensions.  I would definitely  recommend  it. A lot of comparable shampoos are a lot more expensive.</li>
    <li> I ordered the shampoo and a conditoner and got 2 conditioners :(. I didn&#x27;t realize until I was already in the shower and it was lathering.  Seems like a good product but I wish I had the shampoo to go with it...</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t see any difference in my hair</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WAS DISCOUNTED IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST UNBIASED REVIEW***  MY DAUGHTER USES THIS MOROCCAN ARGAN OIL SHAMPOO IN ADDITION TO THE OIL TO MANAGE HER NATURAL HAIR AND IT IS PURE LOVE!!  HER HAIR IS SO SOFT, SHINY AND BOUNCY, IT WAS LIKE THE TEXTURE OF HER HAIR JUST DRAMATICALLY CHANGED IN THE COURSE OF 30-45 DAYS.</li>
    <li> Made my hair greasy. I didn&#x27;t use it beyond two washes. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Smells great, love the way it leaves my hair feeling clean, soft, and silky. I get plenty of body without frizz. A friend recommended this shampoo to me who regularly colors her hair because she knows that I do as well, and this product has helped to repair the damage without fading the color. This will now be my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; shampoo along with the Tru Moroccan conditioner</li>
    <li> My friend ordered this shampoo (along with the conditioner) and highly recommended that I try it. I am so glad that I did! I have dry hair and this shampoo brought it back to life! It made my hair so smooth without making it look greasy and it gave it tons of shine! Plus, it smells AMAZING! I will definitely continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has been great,  our whole family is using it. Working for the dry, flaky scalp.Less oily  and smells so nice.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing! It keeps my hair from being so oily.</li>
    <li> This shampoo revived the dead since my hair which I almost gave up as a hopeless case was revitalized and now I don’t look like I’m wearing a wig that was left out to dry in the sun a little too long!</li>
    <li> Smelly, but it definitely works. It leaves the hair really soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> works as advertised - doesn&#x27;t produce a lot of suds, but makes hair soft, clean, with some shine, and does it with only one shampooing if you want to conserve shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel.  Thanks for the descriptive follow-up email. It lets me know you believe in your products.</li>
    <li> I love what both the Conditioner &amp; Shampoo have done for my hair!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using them both for a few weeks and my hair is noticeably softer, it doesn&#x27;t look or feel as dry as it used to and it looks healthier overall.  Plus, they smell AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;These are really great products that I highly recommend that you try out for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;I also love that they have no artificial colors, no artificial additives, or impurities and it is not tested on animals (and no ingredients are derived from animals, totally Cruelty Free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I did receive this product at a discount or complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  However, I was not paid in anyway and my thoughts and opinions are my own.***</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s hard to tell how much to use. Because it doesn&#x27;t lather or extend on the hair I have to keep using the product in hopes that is cleaning. Nevertheless, my hair seems OK and clean. I don&#x27;t see much improvement on my hair after using this product, but I like to think that at least it&#x27;s natural and I&#x27;m not adding more chemicals to my hair. This is the first time I&#x27;m using a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo; while I won&#x27;t order this brand again, I have ordered a different brand of natural shampoo so I am able to compare results.</li>
    <li> I completely loved this shampoo! I have dry, damaged hair, and I&#x27;ve been using a lot of different kinds of products to get my hair healthier and smoother. I tried the Tru Moroccan shampoo and condition and my hair looks so much better! It smells amazing, and leaves your hair feeling soft, silky, and moisturized, and it&#x27;s never looked healthier! It works best when you buy the conditioner, so make sure to purchase that as well!</li>
    <li> Tru Moroccan shampoo leaves your hair feeling and smelling soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;My teenage daughter and I both use it.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell! i will definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried it once and I&#x27;m on the fence with it.  My hair just doesn&#x27;t feel clean.  I&#x27;ll have to try using a lot more next time and see if I see a difference.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product.  Shampoo is extremely runny and the bottle lists no manufacturing address.  Tried this product as an alternative to Pureology, but it doesn&#x27;t even come close.</li>
    <li> Its the only thing I use now!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth a shot! I have pretty dry hair and it didn&#x27;t help, but if you don&#x27;t have dry hair it may work better.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this product for so many reasons.....  The smell is fabulous, and it gets my hair extremely clean. I love the lather as well.</li>
    <li> Hair does not feel &amp;#34;Silky, and gives no Body&amp;#34;. Left my hair feeling tangled and heavy/greasy feeling at the scalp. Dissapointed in the product despite the high reviews.  I have fine hair and it left it feeling flat and all tangled up.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing! My hair is color treated. I dye my roots blonde every 4 weeks and my hair has been brittle and breaking off. This shampoo transformed my hair. I can tell my hair is healthy and is soft and silky at the roots. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  Leaves my hair feeling natural and clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this before, or at least, reviewed this before, but the bottle is kind of small, though I enjoy the shampoo, especially since it doesn&#x27;t have sulfates.</li>
    <li> I wanted a natural shampoo that could take frizzy hair, but I have to use a great deal of this product to wash my hair. The bottle will be gone in no time and at $15/ bottle its just too steep for my taste.</li>
    <li> I have tried lots to tame my hair and this did it...this makes my hair so soft and looks great!!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. Along with the conditioner, my hair is very soft and healthy, and scalp no longer itches.</li>
    <li> This shampoos is working very good. I think it&#x27;s full naturall and very good for anyone .</li>
    <li> This shampoo is very watery. It&#x27;s not dense at all like you&#x27;d expect a saturating moroccan oil shampoo to be. It truly didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair. Upset I wasted money</li>
    <li> Very nice shampoo, makes my hair soft and shiny and good for everyday use.</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my hair lifeless, and dull....also leaves a residue that makes my hair feel dirty again in less than 8 hours.  Worst I ever used.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo but 4 stars for price too high! Should be 16oz not 8oz for the price. You tend to want to use too much because of the lack of lathering. Smells good and nice final results. It is too expensive for me, so I will be switching.</li>
    <li> I really like the shampoo.  It does not suds the first application as described but does the second application.  I only gave it 4 stars because I am 75 and have very little strength in my right hand and the bottle is almost impossible for me to squeeze.  Even though I like it, I probably will not buy again because I have such a hard time getting it out of the bottle even with pounding it upside down.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of these products and the way it makes my hair feel. It has made my hair shinier, healthier and smoother. Great products and results.</li>
    <li> Tru Moroccan shampoo and conditioner are the best hair products I&#x27;ve found! My husband and daughter use these products as well. My hair has never looked better. I will be back to purchase more</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! It is very concentrated so you need a small amount to go a long way - making this bottle last longer than it looks! I have hard water, a dry scalp, and bleached/highlights and a Brazilian blowout... this shampoo was a godsend. It is sulfate free, so is safe for my color treated and Brazilian blowout hair, and adds softness and shine to my hair while helping my dry scalp. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I like it, but it is hard getting used to a shampoo without a good amount of lather.</li>
    <li> Tru Moroccan Shampoo is a great product!! It made my hair feel clean and left it smelling fresh. It was delivered promptly as well. I will buy again!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing!!  Never again will I buy store bought!  I would definitely recommend this to everyone I know!</li>
    <li> Need to have a bigger bottle especially for the conditioner..price can be a little more affordable as well...but did like the product..</li>
    <li> very good shampoo but a little expensive compared to the normal stuff on the shelf.  there is a slight lathering that gives you the feeling that...yes..i&#x27;m shampooing my hair.  Hair is left very soft and managable  and feeling really clean.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this oil from my stylist.  My hair is long, thick, and curly.  Sometimes it gets a bit unruly, especially if I try to blow it dry straight. This oil is absorbed into the hair instead of sitting on top of it.  That means that if you use the proper amount (I use two pumps - no more) you will get a wonderful feel and shine.  My hair has never felt this good.</li>
    <li> I completely loved this shampoo!  I have dry, damaged hair, and I&#x27;ve been using a lot of different kinds of products to get my hair healthier and smoother.  I tried the Tru Moroccan shampoo and condition and my hair looks so much better!  It smells amazing, and leaves your hair feeling soft, silky, and moisturized, and it&#x27;s never looked healthier!  It works best when you buy the conditioner, so make sure to purchase that as well!</li>
    <li> May be it was my hair.. But this shampoo did not do what it claims to do. I have very dense dry hair. I wanted a shampoo that would moisturizer it and make it smooth and silky. I felt like this dried my hair out even more. May be this one is not for all hair types. Good luck to other buyers.</li>
    <li> From begining it was not full inside.&lt;br /&gt;has moisteure but get ichey very easily.&lt;br /&gt;It was $25 for this size not worth it</li>
    <li> First of all, Amazon did not pack properly.  I had this product leaking inside of a opened bubble wrap pack.  Although this product smells amazing.  I tried it and was disappointed as I was expecting my hair to be silky and moisturized.  I always let my hair air dry and never use a blow dryer.  It looked dry just like other moisturizing shampoos claim. I also realize this product does not lather, leaving my scalp not feeling clean. It did not meet my expectations.  Therefore I will not re-order this product again.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to review both the Shampoo &amp; Conditioner by Tru  Moroccan. First of all let me say they smell absolutely amazing. I love the scent and it&#x27;s a must if its a shampoo I am going to use as I always want my hair smelling good! Anyway I have hair past my shoulders and I still didn&#x27;t have to use that much.&lt;br /&gt;This lathered into my head very well and the conditioner left my hair feeling so soft and rejuvenating. This shampoo also restores hair and helps with damage which I could use since I color treat my hair once a month. It also hydrates which is very important fact in keeping healthy looking hair that is manageable.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner even helps with dry scalp and dandruff which I every now and than battle. So they both take care of all my needs and wants in a shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing! My hair is shiny and healthy. It cleans the oil from my hair really well and I haven’t had to wash it as frequently.</li>
    <li> Decided to try this after finding my hair was unbearably dry and unmanageable after years of coloring and the harsh winter. I will not be using anything else from now on, this shampoo (and conditioner) is great! I have coarse dry hair that&#x27;s a weird mix of curls and waves. This stuff leaves it looking soft it and put together..and not oily. No going back. Thank you thank you thank youu!!</li>
    <li> Disappointed in this product. The shampoo is very drying and the conditioner does nothing to condition your hair. I can buy better shampoo at the grocery store. I think what irritates me most, though, is the fact that you can&#x27;t find out who the manufacturer is. I&#x27;ve looked all over the internet and they don&#x27;t even have a website. That&#x27;s suspicious.  It just says made in U.S.A.  I don&#x27;t trust them.  What are they hiding?</li>
    <li> Excellent fragrance, good cleaning, and easily rinsed out.</li>
    <li> This shampoo might be sulfate free, but what did they put in it instead? I used it twice, hoping that it was me.. But truly, it is very harsh stuff. It stung my eyes like fire, and after two washings and tons of conditioner my hair felt like a pile of straw. I would have been better off using PRELL or some other old fashioned detergent based stuff. I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but after the price I paid I felt that people should know my experience. P.S., I am disliking the trend I see with product reviews, where all the bad ones are at the bottom. Let&#x27;s see what happens with mine...</li>
    <li> this shampoo made my hair feel fuller and gave me more control of frizzies and fly away hair&lt;br /&gt;I really like the nice clean citrus smell</li>
    <li> I just love this shampoo and conditioner.it smells so good.its too small of a bottle for me.I have long thick hair.its too much money fir the size of them.I wish it was cheaper and a 33oz bottles.I do love it tho.</li>
    <li> Not sure if its me but... my hair felt pretty good for the first few weeks then kind of dried out and now my scalp is flaky. I used both the shampoo and conditioner together.</li>
    <li> The whole line of products are awesome! Love all of them.</li>
    <li> Did not really work well for my hair type.</li>
    <li> Did not like it, it made my hair dry I don&#x27;t know why with all the oils in it</li>
    <li> didnt work for my wife and mom. they both tried it and it dried their hair more</li>
    <li> Really liked the feel of my hair after just the first use and hardly needed the conditioner. I have really thick,long hair that gets coloring alot;but when my hair dried it was sooooooooo fluffy,untangled even and felt CLEAN. LOVE the smell alot,but the one drawback that may put people off is a bit pricey. But the best products are gonna cost more folks.And using the conditioner after that makes the smell even more delightful and shiny!!! Recommend using this for people who have to color treat alot.</li>
    <li> Before using Tru Moroccan shampoo, I always felt like my hair and scalp were left greasy, but  now that I&#x27;ve switched to this brand, I  enjoy the feeling And the smell of my hair!!</li>
    <li> I like the smell, but it leaves my indian hair tangled and dry texture.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. This is the first I have found ever that actually leaves my hair soft, not frizzy, stays curly if I want a natural look and also blow dries well for straighter hair. I am in love this product!</li>
    <li> I am always doubtful, but this product had such great reviews when it came to healing damaged hair that I thought I would give a try for my split ends... They send an email after purchase regarding instructions, usage and timeline, which is kinda great.  It took about two months of use (I wash my hair every other day and followed the instructions to the letter) but my split ends are GONE.  Completely! Which is amazing.  I love it and will never use another shampoo/ conditioner again!</li>
    <li> I got my hubby to go sulfate free with his shampoo several years ago; his hair grows so fast he calls sulfate free shampoo &amp;#34;fertilizer shampoo&amp;#34;!  (I am a no shampoo girl, use only condition to both cleanse and condition.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Tru Moroccan&#x27;s conditioner and recently purchase the shampoo for him.  He loves it!  Gently yet thoroughly cleans his hair and scalp, hair is soft and manageable, rinses out easily, a calming tropical mango/pineapple scent.  His new favorite &amp;#34;fertilizer shampoo&amp;#34;.  Try it!</li>
    <li> I have psoraiasis on my elbows and scalp. Used every kind of shampoo to control and this cleared and keeps it clear.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Did not notice a difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> Wow, this shampoo smells wonderful.  I love that it is sulfate and paraben free.  I&#x27;ve been trying to use gentler hair products because I am trying to grow out my hair.  This product did suds up for me and rinsed out clean.  No residue left behind and works great with the conditioner.  The shampoo is not as moisturizing as I though it would be but, it does not dry out my hair either.  It is just right.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided</li>
    <li> I did not like this shampoo at all.  It dried my hair up horrible.  It felt completely stripped and and dry after I rinsed it.  I use it as a body wash now :/  Waste of money!</li>
    <li> This is a wonder shampoo. It leaves my hair feeling soft, bouncy and smooth. I struggle with dry hair and it tends to get frizzy in the summer heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In just a few applications, this shampoo is taming some of that wild woman frizz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent. It is nice and not overpowering as some Moroccan products can be. The shampoo cleans and removes the buildup of products. Only need a little amount as a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combined with the conditioner, this is a great combination treatment to repair your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> I was offered a new, improved version of;&amp;#34; Tru Moroccan,&amp;#34; and it really is improved.&lt;br /&gt; My hair is quite dry and coarse. The first&lt;br /&gt;bottle  I tried made little difference- this one does.</li>
    <li> The best  scented shampoo I ever tried. Makes my hair soft and shiny. I wish there was the same conditioner would be even better. Absolutely recommend it, try it and see the difference. Thanks to who ever made this shampoo. Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Not the best for the price.. Helps soften but nothing out of the ordinary.. Could definitely find something comprable for less</li>
    <li> This is a good product. Since using it my hair isnt as frizzy anymore and its softer. The shampoo also smells really good too.</li>
    <li> Worst shampoo I have ever used. Made my hair dryer and completely unmanageable I have sent back for a refund. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this crap.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s done any wonders for my hair though... but it hasn&#x27;t made it any worse either :)</li>
    <li> Great organic and natural product. It does have an odd smell but it is not nasty or anything. It is just odd, like a juice. I guess because this product is so much different from the other ones that use chemical and perfumes and toxic stuff.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis on my scalp so it&#x27;s often dry and itchy.  Add to that I color and use a flat iron regularly, so between the psoriasis, chemicals and heat, my hair can always use some help :)  After using this shampoo for a couple of weeks I can really tell that my hair and scalped are more moisturized.  I don&#x27;t need very much of the shampoo to lather up in my shoulder length hair, so this bottle should last a good while, plus it&#x27;s cheaper than other argan oil based shampoos I have used.  Bonus... it smells fantastic, when my husband comments on how good my hair smells that underscores it ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this shampoo at no cost to myself for an honest review.  All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed when I was opening the shampoo was the nice seal that was on it. May not be a big deal to some, but for me that was a big plus. The OCD girl in me appreciates knowing that they care enough to make sure each product was sealed after they produced it, so that I know the product hadn&#x27;t been tampered with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next thing I noticed was the amazing Moroccan Argan Oil smell, it has a very unique smell unlike any other but I rather enjoyed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I proceeded to wash my hair with it, which I actually used and rinsed twice just to make sure I was getting the full effect from it. However, I am sure one time is enough. After, I was amazed at how soft my hair was, and how clean it felt. This was before I even used the conditioner! I thought this was a huge plus in itself as well, because I usually have such dry and sometimes flaky hair. It also added a lot of moisture to my hair, which is something I don&#x27;t always get with my regular brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I often do is flat-iron my hair (since I have such wavy hair) and just this once decided not to put a whole bunch of protecting products in it, and noticed it did just as well as when I do put products in it. I love knowing that if I am out of a product, I can be comfortable with straightening my hair and not have to run out that minute to get something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really have any negatives with the Shampoo. I guess if I had anything to pick at it would be the price is a little on the high end. For the amount of product and the quality of the product, I believe it is well justified though. I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I did receive this product complementary, but this is 100% my honest opinion and that in no way changed my opinion about the product (I have been a blogger for 2 yrs now, and have given good reviews &amp; bad. If this review happened to be good than it deserved it).</li>
    <li> This shampoo worked great to give my hair shine! It made my hair very soft and manageable as well. It smells absolutely wonderful! I would highly recommend this product and I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I have used the shampoo 3 times and have already noticed a huge difference in how my hair feels, and it feels great! The company e-mailed me directions and some facts about the shampoo after I bought it which was really nice. They had said to expect maximum results after a couple of months of use, and at this rate I can only imagine how amazing my hair will be :) Now I just need the conditioner...</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo in combination with the TruMoroccan Conditioner and I love them both equally, but together, they are amazing! Both the shampoo and the conditioner smell fantastic—very similar to Victoria&#x27;s Secret &amp;#34;Lovespell&amp;#34; perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is made with all-natural ingredients and it works like a charm on my hair. My hair is clean, soft, and shiny after every use. I highly recommend it. It is not watery like other shampoos that I&#x27;ve used in the past, so a little bit goes a long way. The sale price, to me, is absolutely reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Product provided for review without cost. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Amazing! This is my first time using shampoo that&#x27;s free of harsh chemicals and has all these oils. It smells great, too! My hair is dry/super prone to being frizzy because it&#x27;s curly/wavy and I&#x27;ve been coloring it and straightening it for years. So my hair is very damaged...first use and it&#x27;s softer already! Will keep buying.</li>
    <li> This product works well on my winter-ravaged hair and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo made all the difference my hair was dry and now looks really great. But i must admit I like all of Moroccan items</li>
    <li> I ordered this to replace another argan oil shampoo I had been using and it just doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  It left my hair feeling dry and the conditioner gave it a heavy waxy feel but it wasn&#x27;t soft.  Now I am stuck with a full bottle of each and I wasted close to $30.00.</li>
    <li> Nice, clean smell, not perfumy, which I do not like.  It also leaves my hair soft and not dried out.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the high reviews...it was absolutely worthless! It doesn&#x27;t work at all and it doesn&#x27;t even open! Maybe I just got a bad batch idk,but it really sucks!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like at all. I think this makes my hair feel worse than any shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used other than the maple holistics Argan oil which is just as bad. As soon as you rinse it out, your hair feels like you have been in a pool with too much chlorine. The price is ridiculous for such a bad product.</li>
    <li> There are a couple of things that I miss about coloring my hair, first is the shine. When I color my hair I have the shiniest hair!! Not so much without it. I was thrilled to be given the opportunity to review Tru Moroccan Repair shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I’m thoroughly impressed with both the Tru Moroccan Repair Shampoo and the Tru Moroccan Repair Conditioners. Both are made of high-quality ingredients. Both smell divine!!  But, beyond smelling wonderful, my hair is also very soft with plenty of shine.  My hair isn’t too soft that it doesn’t hold a style.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is great my silver hair, containing Jojoba along with Argan oil to strengthen, protect, and provide shine. I love that this shampoo uses natural ingredients to moisturize my hair and scalp. My hair is so dry due to the pool water; Alice and I swim everyday; not only am I exhausted at the end of the day but my hair also takes the brunt of the damage. Pool water is HARD on hair!! This duo has truly helped to repair my hair, restore it’s shine and make my hair feel so soft!  A small amount of this very potent and rehydrating conditioner is all you need to thoroughly seal in moisture, shine and protection to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;No sulfates or parabens. This shampoo is not tested on animals. The shampoo is gentle enough to use everyday.I have received a free or greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and the matching conditioner completely dried my hair out. This is one of the worst shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair. Not a quality product in my opinion unless you have really oily hair... Even then it might still destroy your hair.  BEWARE AND BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK! This will be going in the trash...along with the money spent to buy these horrible products.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft and smelling nice. My scalp can be sensitive and can get many pimples if I use poor quality shampoo. Have never had pimple problmes yet since i switched to this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I am using this and the matching conditioner.  I am very pleased with the results.  This shampoo is clear.  It lathers nicely.  It has a nice smell that lingers for a couple of days.  It makes my curly hair frizz free.  I have applied argan oil to my hair in the past, but this shampoo and conditioner is so much handier.  I am quite pleased with this product.  sample provided.</li>
    <li> I really love this product but it makes my scalp itchy. Maybe I just need to get used to it first. Besides that it is amazing. My hair has never felt better, and I can tell it doesn&#x27;t get as oily as quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review for a hair product before, but this particular shampoo and conditioner deserves some accolade. I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out for the past year while still regularly dyeing it, and as a result my hair has become brittle and wiry. Nothing like it used to be. With just ONE shower using this shampoo and conditioner my hair feels like it used to. It&#x27;s soft, elastic, and even though we&#x27;re expecting a huge storm today it&#x27;s not at all frizzy or unmanageable. Also, I&#x27;m not sure what other reviewers are talking about when they say the shampoo is runny. Maybe they&#x27;ve changed the recipe a bit because it&#x27;s thick enough for me, and it lathers just fine. Such a great purchase. I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I love this Shampoo it makes dry and brittle hair soft and  shiny I will be puchasing another bottle+conditioner really soon</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner to help with my fine, dry greying hair which had acquired a mind of it&#x27;s own, particularly in damp weather. It works very well indeed and the product in both the shampoo and conditioner is highly concentrated so one does not need to use much. My hair is shiny and manageable. I will certainly continue to buy this product</li>
    <li> My hair falls off more.</li>
    <li> wish it came in large bottles</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter.  Her hair is very thick and was very dry.  Tru Moroccan totally changed the texture of her hair!  Her hair now has body and isn&#x27;t frizzy at the ends.  I would refer this product to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> This Best Natural Shampoo is amazing stuff!&lt;br /&gt;This morning, I went to my salon to get my hair cut. My hair dresser said she was amazed that I had no product build up in my hair and needed to know what I was using. I told her what I was using and she hadn&#x27;t heard of it but wanted to know where she could buy it. She also told me my hair was very healthy. This shampoo has done the best job with my (pasted) damaged hair. I am so happy it&#x27;s noticeable to other&#x27;s. I love the smell, how well it lathers and it&#x27;s very easy to rinse out. I highly recommend this Best Natural Shampoo. I based this review with my honest opinion</li>
    <li> As a swimmer with chlorine damaged hair, this shampoo has helped repair my hair. Smells great and makes my hair soft.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great! It has really helped my oily hair and frizz. I will be buying more soon!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for my son who started to develop a dandruff-type scalp. Since Best Natural Shampoo says to have Moroccan oil and it is a sulfate and paraben free product, it worked for three or four times. The itchy, flaky scalp returned so he stopped using it and started washing his hair just with organic black soap and his condition improved it, tremendously. Now he&#x27;s back to Best Natural Shampoo as his daily shampoo, but he alternates between Sage shampoo, bought through Amazon too. When for a long time a person has used those chemical-based shampoos, it is not easy to reverse a condition because our bodies need time to heal. This shampoo has proven to be appropriate to combat my son&#x27;s scalp problem and to be his daily shampoo and it is my hope the company won&#x27;t change its business ethics or raise to astronomical prices, for there the vicious cycle will start when going back to cheap-made shampoos. Please with this product.</li>
    <li> Buy this product and the conditioner! It is worth it! So, I really don&#x27;t take time to write these but I really need to!  I purchased this shampoo and conditioner based on the reviews and I am so HAPPY I did! The shampoo does not lather (which I miss) but that is because it is not full of chemicals-it&#x27;s organic and healthy! You even get an email from the company telling you that you will not experience the lather in the shampoo and why -that is a nice touch from the company that makes this.  The shampoo and conditioner have taken away my frizz and although the conditioner felt heavy the first time in the shower, -the results are worth it. Like everyone has said, I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed. :)</li>
    <li> I did receive this product in exchange, but this is 100% my honest opinion and that in no way changed my opinion about the product&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice it to be heavily scented which is what I expected. I did not notice a huge lather when applying. If those are things you look for this is your product. It does provide a nice clean and shine without weighing hair down. It was easy to rinse from hair and more manageable.</li>
    <li> My hair looks beautiful an feels great ! Well worth the purchase ! I color my hair every month  &amp; this doesn&#x27;t strip my hair so my color last longer. It smells great too, Love this product. 07/10/15 I have been using Tru Morrocan shampoo for over a year &amp; I can&#x27;t say enough about how my hair looks &amp; feels. My hair dresser says my hair is in great condition!!</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!!  If you have dry or dead looking hair, this shampoo will restore the shine and help make your hair more manageable.  I had very damaged hair from too many color changes and after using this shampoo only once, my hair regained most of its original shine and now after a few weeks of use, my hair is back to it&#x27;s original shine and fullness. It has a great scent and lathers up really well with just a small amount so that means it will last for a while!</li>
    <li> This is PERFECT for my type of hair!</li>
    <li> I have long, curly hair that tends to be dry. This shampoo was moisturizing, but did not weigh down my curls or make my hair greasy. Smell is nice and fresh but not perfume-y.  I really like this and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Smells AMAZING, but it makes getting a brush through my hair almost impossible. I have to use a deep conditioner every day with this. Will probably buy again some day.</li>
    <li> I like less or no harsh/harmful chemicals but this really wasn&#x27;t anything special for my hair. I prefer using my homemade shampoo (coconut water, aloe, a little olive oil, and dr. bronners liquid soap and/or rosemary or chamomile tea) or I like the brand Shea Moisture which is about $13.</li>
    <li> Very good and natural product. Cleans very well, use it with the conditioner so you can moisturize your hair. Give a nice heathy shine.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells great!  Alittle bit goes a long way! Tru Moroccan has great lather and washes out clean. The amazing scent lasts way longer than other similar products! I will never use anything else!</li>
    <li> Ive tried a lot of Moroccan Oil products...but this one is far and away the best!!! It smells AWESOME...and leaves my hair clean and shiny and SO soft!  This will be my new go-to in Moroccan Oil shampoos!!</li>
    <li> Fabulous smell &amp; and leaves my hair feeling extra clean and soft. Typically I need to shampoo my fine hair every day but with this stuff, I actually skipped a day and my hair looked and felt great!</li>
    <li> I had never heard of this product until it was recommended by a friend and I saw it sponsored by Amazon. When I tried it my fine, straight overly processed hair was either going to have to be cut short which will never happen or a miracle needed to happen!  I&#x27;ve always been one to try new things, but as far as my hair goes I have had little luck and I have tried it all.... expensive, budget smart, home remedies....nothing came close to what I was needing. Until I used TRU Moroccan!!!! Not only did it leave my hair soft but full of body and some volume even when I didn&#x27;t blow dry! Awesome for me. It has no sufates which are damaging to hair. Smell is also important to me and this is just clean and smells like citrus,...perfect! After washing my hair I put the tiniest bit of oil through my hair comb and style as usual. If this worked for me and I love it, I know it will work for you, too!!!!</li>
    <li> Good for colored hair.  Doesn&#x27;t lather greatly but not unexpected.  Good price.</li>
    <li> I just bought this shampoo to help with my dry hair. I bleach and color a lot so my hair is always dry. The smell isn&#x27;t fantastic but my first use I already feel and see a difference. My hair feels healthy and shiny already. I can&#x27;t to see what it does after a few more usages. I used the conditioner that goes along with this shampoo and it wonderful. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather up so much but they say that is a good thing. The scent isn&#x27;t bad but it&#x27;s not very scented either. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I have RA and since starting the medications needed to treat my condition I have been looking for products for my family that aren&#x27;t full of harsh chemicals.  I just found this Moroccan Argan Oil Shampoo and let me say, it is AMAZING!  The shampoo has a really beautiful fragrance when you open the bottle, but it&#x27;s not so &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; that my husband wouldn&#x27;t try it.  We&#x27;ve both used it several times since receiving it and we are hooked.  You don&#x27;t need a lot, but when used you get out of the shower with clean feeling, clean smelling, soft and manageable hair.  We are both really impressed with this product and my next purchase will be to add the matching conditioner.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was a great buy. I feel like it helped to repair my color damaged hair. It cleaned my hair and scalp well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on the previous reviews, and I had very high expectations on it. But I didn&#x27;t feel much of the difference when I used it for the first time. Maybe it&#x27;s too early to say so, but I will keep using it and see if it actually make a difference on my hair. By the way, it just says Made in USA, but without a clear location. This is a bit uncommon compared to the other hair products.</li>
    <li> I was able to feel my hair more soft and docile with the first time use.</li>
    <li> tru Moroccan Shampoo Argan Oil has been used with the conditioner on my color treated hair&lt;br /&gt;and I love it&lt;br /&gt;my hair has no frizz and shines so much more&lt;br /&gt;love this Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;and it is far better than the OTC at most retailers</li>
    <li> Makes my hair so soft and manageable, just not much lather like I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> I have been using salon style products for years. I was wanting to be more natural after reading all the chemicals on the label. I was offered a coupon to try this all natural shampoo and thought why not. My honest opinion is WOW, if I had known my hair would feel like this without all the chemicals, I would have tried it years ago. Thank you Tru Moroccan, you gave me a bottle but now I&#x27;m hooked!!</li>
    <li> Ive used Moroccan Oil hair products for years and this one  smells great and leaves my hair cleaner and shinier, with more volume. It keeps my hair cleaner longer than most shampoos.</li>
    <li> I got these (along with the conditioner) mostly for my mom and she loves them!  Considering she&#x27;s been a beautician going on 26 years, she found the shampoo worked really well for her frizzy hair and made it much more soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She also pointed out the list of natural ingredients used, how they&#x27;re safe and haven&#x27;t stripped her hair of any color.  She really liked that the ingredients DON&#x27;T include sulfate, which explained all the lather she got from it.</li>
    <li> This product smells wonderful, but did not lather much, besides being very runny. I had a hard time getting it from my hand to my hair without spilling off my hand</li>
    <li> This is the most horrible smelling shampoo that I have ever smelled in my life. I can&#x27;t even describe the smell other than some sort of strong fake orange smell. I returned this product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is horrible.  I&#x27;m very puzzled by the reviews.  It&#x27;s so drying that my hair was knotted up after using it.  It smells great though.  I am returning this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Dont let the lack of suds fool you. My hair is the healthiest its ever been and my hair also stays clean longer. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Product is perfect for my fine thin hair. Everything else i&#x27;ve tried leaves my scalp with red bumps and alot hair loss. If you&#x27;re considering trying this product because nothing else works well.. BUY IT and see for yourself how well it works. Still on month 1, but if this first month is any indication of future progress on healing my scalp and hair i&#x27;ll be buying this everytime i need shampoo!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. It&#x27;s so thin you end up using a quarter of the bottle as it pours out so fast. Didn&#x27;t do anything useful for my hair.</li>
    <li> The only thing I liked about this shampoo &amp; conditioner was the smell. Other than that, it didnt do anything for me. I have long, fine hair. I feel like it weighed it down/didnt wash my hair very well, which is a problem for me, because I wash my hair every other day.</li>
    <li> Very nice, gentle, low to no suds shampoo. Be sure to follow the instructions.</li>
    <li> this organic, chemical free shampoo makes my hair glossy and stopped my hair fall thoroughly. But i recommend that one has to get theconditioner to go with this to make the hair soft and manageable. although i can go without conditioner at times and my hair still looks nice and fresh. My scalp don&#x27;t itch too from this shampoo and i like the fresh feeling and fresh scent after every wash. it lingers and stay long too.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this shampoo would have a nicer scent.  It is a good product; just don&#x27;t know that I would re-order.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! My hair is so healthy and soft a few weeks in after using it. Also love the smell.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product to me and so far I love IT!!!</li>
    <li> Because I am always testing natural products on my &amp;#34;over-60&amp;#34; hair, I recently tried the Tru Moroccan Argan Oil shampoo. I pay for all of the products that I have reviewed, so no one sent me any free samples to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I used only a little, expected it not to suds up a lot, as I knew that was not necessary for cleansing, and was very pleased with the results. I was taken back by how little was necessary to thoroughly shampoo my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liked it so much, that I loaned it out to a family friend. Now, she wants to buy it, so I just ordered more. My hair sometimes feels like a horse&#x27;s mane, but with the Tru Moroccan shampoo, it felt clean, smooth, and bouncy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Once you apply it to your wet hair, then add more warm water to your head. You will have PLENTY of suds, but they are soft, gentle suds - NOT like what you may be used to. After you rinse it out, your hair and scalp will be REALLY clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is very thick, and a small amount goes a long way! My hair feels extremely soft, and is starting to look like it did many years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just give it time to counteract the sulfates and dimethicone that may have been in your regular hair products.</li>
    <li> my hair has never been drier or frizzier... not for curly or dry hair! on the plus side, the smell is really nice, but not nice enough to have frizzy hair over</li>
    <li> I recently colored my blonde hair a very bold red.. The first few times I washed my newly red hair, I watched my expensive color go down the drain. My colorist told me to use a shampoo that was free of sulfates so I took to Amazon to find a sulfate-free shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Tru Moroccan, read over the ingredients and decided to give it a try, ordering both shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order arrived quickly and was preceded by a lovely email from the company with detailed instructions on product use and letting me know the order was out for delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order arrived securely packaged with no leaks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, next to wash my waist length, newly red mane. This product smells so great!! The shampoo lathers but not in a huge way, just a nice, little cleansing lather. I was so very happy to not see a red tinted lather!! Could this be the savior for my new color? Now granted, I did have a bit of a tangled mess after lathering up that full mane of mine so it was time to try the conditioner. I used an amount equal to a grape. Flipped my head upside down and started to work it through. All those tangles melted away and no red color left my hair!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinsed my hair, did not repeat. Wrapped a towel around my head and was thrilled to no longer see red streaks on the towel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair smells, great, looks great and is maintaining that lovely red color! I love this product so much, I just purchased another bottle of shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I am posting this same review on the conditioner)</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It allows me to wash my hair without having an oily residue left over. It helps maintain the natural wave and body in my hair, something I had lost after years of using regular shampoo and conditioner. I will continue to use and recommend this product to others. I especially appreciate the email that I received after each order to give me tips for using the product effectively.</li>
    <li> Great results, my hair feels really moisturized and silky too!  I love it, this is a great product!  Can you make a nice leave in silk moisturizing treatment for the hair too?  That would be awesome!</li>
    <li> Due to very dry, damaged hair, I was seeking a shampoo and conditioner that would resolve that situation with very natural ingredients.  There are other products that contain Argan oil, but this one is the best quality available.  Most shampoos and especially conditioners contain alcohol and other ingredients that dry the hair.  This one is pure and contains no harmful chemicals.  I intend to buy the shampoo and conditioner again.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have always had soft shiny hair. After using this shampoo for 2 weeks my hair is now dry and dull. And it makes my color run. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> cleans and protects my hair color.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I am not using it. It leaves my hair so dry, I don&#x27;t think it is for me.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and quality of ingredients. It appears my hair does too! I&#x27;ve noticed a definite increase in shine, softness, and thickness. I will probably repurchase as its a lot cheaper than other organic shampoos.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. If I use regular shampoo, sometimes I&#x27;ll take a tiny dab of this stuff. I live in a very dry climate, so dry skin and dandruff is unavoidable. A little dab gets rid of the friz, but doesn&#x27;t make things all oily. A little expensive for what it is, but use tiny amounts and it&#x27;ll last.</li>
    <li> Seems like a good shampoo and conditioner, however the conditioner will not come out of bottle.  Even if I take the cap off, it will not come out !</li>
    <li> This is a water based, natural shampoo that is very light. My hair definitely benefitted from this shampoo. But, now that I have been using it for a month, it isn&#x27;t going to keep bringing my hair to the next level such as a super saiyan. Give your hair a break with this shampoo. Honestly. If you have very oily or dry or damaged hair, it doesn&#x27;t mean it is neccessarily nature. It means you are probably doing something wrong to your hair like overheating it, using harsh chemicals, etc. I reccommend using this shampoo for 2 months. A quarter sized amount is directed however it does not lather enough so it spreads throughout your whole head of hair. I have to do 2-3 quarter sizes. 1 for the scalp area, 1 for the longer hair. Then, after you have used this shampoo for a while, try buying a gentle, natural, fragrance-free shampoo. Maple Holistics has many varieties for all hair types.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife&#x27;s long hair... it goes down to the middle of her back. She has a hard time keeping to a single shampoo because her hair begins to feel weighted down and becomes unmanageable. She wanted a light, healthy, natural shampoo so we decided to give this a try. After two bottles, she says this is the BEST SHAMPOO she has used in years. It doesn&#x27;t matter what conditioner she uses, her hair always feels light and refreshed with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells AMAZING. Probably one of the best smelling shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used. I liked this shampoo ok; sometimes it seemed like it didn&#x27;t clean my hair well the first time and I needed to wash a second time. I don&#x27;t know if it did anything spectacular to my hair, so probably not worth the price, but I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it.</li>
    <li> No longer has same ingredients as when I last bought it so I changed my review. I went to buy again and this is a different product, not natural with gotu kola but instead has all kinds of other chemical ingredients.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the consistency too much and feel like i need to use more than a quarter&#x27;s amount to cover my shoulder length hair, but overall, the feeling after the shower is soft</li>
    <li> I recently switched to an expensive and the most well-known national chain hair salon, which surprisingly has a contract to only use a certain brand of cheap over-the-counter hair bleach (the same brand that punk teenagers buy from the beauty supply store to use, when they are playing with their hair color at home). I had pretty &amp; thick hair for a long time before, but after switching to the new salon, they eventually fried my hair terribly.  The breakage looks like I layered my hair, even though I&#x27;ve only ever had it cut to one length. Word to the wise - don&#x27;t be so trusting of salons - ask which products are used and look up reviews and ingredients yourself, no matter how snooty they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I&#x27;ve been using organic African hair products, which work well. And this Tru Moroccan conditioner also made my hair feel really soft and smooth. It doesn&#x27;t have any of the bad chemicals that I&#x27;ve stopped using in shampoo and conditioner. It&#x27;s really thick, so it helps to keep the bottle upside down to get the product out. I am going to order my second bottle, and I plan to keep using this.</li>
    <li> silky hair restores hair in women</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shampoo!! I have tried a ton of different &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos, and they always fall short. Not this one. I have oily, straight, thin hair AND dandruff, so I&#x27;m a tough customer. Dandruff is now gone! My hair is bouncy and clean looking, but not dried out. It smells great... almost like fruity candy, but not in a sickening way.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has been the only shampoo that has worked for me!  It is natural and has taken away my itchy scalp and flakes that was so embarrassing.....This works!!  I love it!</li>
    <li> A must if you have extensions</li>
