      <li>I am now looking spend more money and invest in a better shower radio.  :)</li>
      <li>Not a terrible thing</li>
      <li>I make sure that I am the one who changes the batteries in this one.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this radio in my shower for over a year and it works ok.  </li>
      <li>It was mentioned as one of the top 3 shower radios.  </li>
      <li>The sound quality is good, just what you&#x27;d expect from a cheap radio, and I have no problem getting my station.</li>
      <li>and I am satisfied.  </li>
      <li>Bought it again this time more for the clock than the radio, and the clock did not work.</li>
      <li>I got this radio about a month ago, and it works great so far!</li>
      <li>But these are the most cheaply made shower/clock/radios ever.</li>
      <li>just wishes the sound quality was better.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s dial is really tricky to work and get any good reception.  </li>
      <li>This is an extremely &#x60;neat&#x27; one, looks good,  and has a surprisingly good quality sound!  </li>
      <li>I was kind of nervous to get this with all the other reviews but it works great in my shower.</li>
      <li>I had the previous iSing model and it worked great!</li>
      <li>but this is so cheap it isn&#x27;t even usable.</li>
      <li>or you can have it free standing with a pull out stand.  </li>
      <li>sound quality and tuning make this a paper weight for me.</li>
      <li>(some people do not take into account the size and capability of these speakers - and their purpose when criticising the sound of these things)  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect the suction cups to attach securely, even to smooth ceramic tile.</li>
      <li>When the radio dies, the buzzing/wailing sound is all you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The top 2 were around $50, so I bought the Ising because it had a more reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>over many years; they are making some really nice quality ones nowadays at exceptionally low cost.</li>
      <li>Spend a little more and get something better!!</li>
      <li>I found that pressing on the tuner knob made everything better, so it&#x27;s now permanently pressed into contact with a stout rubber band (the kind you get with broccoli) stretched horizontally around the unit and across the knob.  </li>
      <li>I had a shower radio for many years that worked very well..  </li>
      <li>The dial is super touchy and any movement will fuzz up any radio station.</li>
      <li>People with larger fingers may find it even more challenging.</li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;m just lucky...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m right downtown and all my other radios work great).    </li>
      <li>This radio is not super great.</li>
      <li>bigger, more unforgivable issue is that it can not hold a radio station!</li>
      <li>The product was what it was....gets better than fair reception, not great, but fine</li>
      <li>The volume and tone are good and receiption in the fringe area where I live is better than other radio receivers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t rate it as worth $15.00.</li>
      <li>This is the cheapest shower radio out there, but it&#x27;s not even worth the $10 list price.     </li>
      <li>IF you want a good shower radio look at some other radio.</li>
      <li>just right</li>
      <li>One did not work right out of the box.  </li>
      <li>I returned it and was refunded right away.</li>
      <li>so tuning shouldnt be a problem right?  </li>
      <li>so i can get a halfway decent sound out of it.    </li>
      <li>I gave it three stars because it worked fine initially, but after a period of time it has a tendency to lose sound sporadically.</li>
      <li>digital clock is handy and very</li>
      <li>Ok, got this as a gift and it worked ok for about the first day with a little bit of patience..</li>
      <li>tuned in, the sound is very loud and</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re not picky about sound and just want something simple, this is a great little radio.  </li>
      <li>It died after a couple of weeks and now only makes a lovely whining noise when you turn it on.</li>
      <li>I am able to pick up all local stations.</li>
      <li>so it takes extra diligence to make sure it has been turned off.</li>
      <li>you have to make sure and turn it all the way off or your batteries run down quickly.</li>
      <li>Sound quality is barely acceptable.  </li>
      <li>This radio might be good on a sidetable or on a desk somewhere as a small portable radio, but for the purpose of a shower-radio??</li>
      <li>but i thought it would be fine for my purposes as i only really listen to one station.  </li>
      <li>so this didn&#x27;t really bother</li>
      <li>the batteries get low, the radio begins to make a buzzing and then a wailing sound.  </li>
      <li>The sound cuts in and out and you have to constantly fiddle with the button, and it goes</li>
      <li>I spent more time trying to tune in a station.   </li>
      <li>I got this radio for my shower,it will not pick sound inside or outside the shower.</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s very touchy),</li>
      <li>The fact that I spent four years listening to you should indicate I hoped for more.</li>
      <li>It helps me keep track of time when I&#x27;m getting ready.</li>
      <li>It would have cost almost as much to ship it back as it originally cost, so I&#x27;m stuck with it.  </li>
      <li>The sound is good, but it&#x27;s frustrating to be listening to a story on the radio, and have it drop off for several seconds.</li>
      <li>I bought this mainly to keep me on time when in shower.</li>
      <li>and sometimes I must put it up high or on a desk to get the stations</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t even a high quality radio but served the purpose well.  </li>
      <li>i didnt have high expectations for this product given the review</li>
      <li>This radio is much smaller than most of the other big, clunky shower radios available.  </li>
      <li>in all, though, it&#x27;s cheap and generally does what you ask of it, and you can finally listen to Car Talk in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM</li>
      <li>I listened for a few more years like this and then it lost all power.</li>
      <li>(Strange but true.)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Poor quality shower radio. Requires separate batteries for radio and clock (quite annoying). Battery compartment did not seal properly, resulting in water ingression and corrosion of the battery posts. Cleaned with steel wool but the unit ultimately failed after less than 6 months. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> On the recommendation of Good Housekeeping, I purchased the Zadro Ising Shower Radio.  It was mentioned as one of the top 3 shower radios.  The top 2 were around $50, so I bought the Ising because it had a more reasonable price.  It turned out to be no better than the old one I had thrown away.  The only time the stations came in clear was when I was holding it in my hand, which makes it a little difficult to shower.  I tried placing it in a good place, but the reception didn&#x27;t improve.  It would have cost almost as much to ship it back as it originally cost, so I&#x27;m stuck with it.  I guess you get what you pay for, but I can&#x27;t afford $50.00 for a shower radio.</li>
    <li> The product was what it was....gets better than fair reception, not great, but fine but it took twice as long to receive as it was suppose to .It took almost 2/12 weeks.</li>
    <li> This is very light &amp; fits well in the shower. However, I ended up returning it, because I thought it also contained AM, it&#x27;s FM only.</li>
    <li> PROs: This radio is much smaller than most of the other big, clunky shower radios available.  It&#x27;s only about 6 1/2 x 3 inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With two suction cups, it really does stick firmly to any smooth shower wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When tuned in, the sound is very loud and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The digital clock is handy and very simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs: It eats batteries, 3 AAAs at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find the green color anymore, and it was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s difficult to tune in - the numbers on the dial have no relation to reality, and it takes a good bit of finesse to home in on a station.  (Once you do, it&#x27;s set as long as you leave it alone.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the batteries get low, the radio begins to make a buzzing and then a wailing sound.  When the radio dies, the buzzing/wailing sound is all you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, though, it&#x27;s cheap and generally does what you ask of it, and you can finally listen to Car Talk in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM to this review: after a few weeks of use, the channel started going out.  I found that pressing on the tuner knob made everything better, so it&#x27;s now permanently pressed into contact with a stout rubber band (the kind you get with broccoli) stretched horizontally around the unit and across the knob.  A simple fix and all is well.</li>
    <li> The clocks digital screen was broken when I opened it, so I had to return it. the radio came in well but it didn&#x27;t get very loud.</li>
    <li> This is a powerful little radio, just right to have in the shower.  It gets stations very clear. I only have one complaint.  I can&#x27;t get it to stay on the wall with the &#x27;cups&#x27; on the back on the radio so I just set it on the ledge of the shower.  The fact that it is little and brings in stations clearly overshadows the little suction problem.</li>
    <li> This is the second of these radios I have had.  The first only failed because it fell off the wall and broke.  I make sure that I am the one who changes the batteries in this one.  We love listening to NPR in the shower!  This is one of the best buys you will make.</li>
    <li> I bought this radio for my shower about a year or two ago.  It doesn&#x27;t sound great, and I often couldn&#x27;t get stations to come in unless I put it on the counter OUT of the shower (thus defeating the purpose of a shower radio).  I&#x27;d recommend getting a different one, or using a regular radio outside of your shower.</li>
    <li> This is the Only one that gets my hard-to-find stations. I&#x27;ve tried more expensive ones &amp; they didn&#x27;t work at all! I guess I&#x27;m just lucky...</li>
    <li> My biggest problem with this radio is that the numbers on the dial in no way correspond to where the actual numbers are!  For instance, I was going nuts trying to find 101.1.  Where did I finally find it?  Next to  the number 104 on the dial.  Ridiculous.  Then, I&#x27;ll be listening to it and it will just go out!  So I have found that when I&#x27;m in a rush in the morning (which is a predicament I find myself in everyday being a working Mom), I take longer showers because I&#x27;m spending too much time trying to find a station.    As they&#x27;ve said about some movies..... \\&quot;Be afraid.... be VERY afraid.\\&quot;    And stay away!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to beat this FM radio at the price. This is my second. The first gave out after about two years -- the volume knob had to be held down to get any volume out of the speaker. But two years of daily use in a shower isn&#x27;t bad for a radio at this price. The volume and tone are good and receiption in the fringe area where I live is better than other radio receivers I&#x27;ve owned. The only defect: suction cups on the back aren&#x27;t up to the task. Don&#x27;t expect the suction cups to attach securely, even to smooth ceramic tile. Instead, extend the 6\\&quot; antenna. Then carefully bend the end of the antenna into a hook with long-nose pliers. Hang the hook over any rail or rod in your shower stall.</li>
    <li> I spent more time trying to tune in a station.   Then when I finally got the station I wanted tuned in, within a few minutes it would fade out!!  YIKES..  Sound was poor.  This radio completely died few months.   But, as others said.. You get what you pay for. :(    I am now looking spend more money and invest in a better shower radio.  :)</li>
    <li> One of a few Shower Radios I&#x27;ve been purchasing to add to my collection recently. This is an extremely &#x60;neat&#x27; one, looks good,  and has a surprisingly good quality sound!  (some people do not take into account the size and capability of these speakers - and their purpose when criticising the sound of these things)  It has two suction cups if you want to stick it anywhere (I personally never rely on them - they always fall off due to steam etc.) or you can have it free standing with a pull out stand.  It takes separate batteries for the radio, and there is a built in clock which is run by a watch type battery separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great radio and great quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a collector of quite a few shower/bath radios, and over many years; they are making some really nice quality ones nowadays at exceptionally low cost.</li>
    <li> i didnt have high expectations for this product given the review but i thought it would be fine for my purposes as i only really listen to one station.  so tuning shouldnt be a problem right?  wrong...this radio has a fairly loose tuner so everytime i turn it on, i have to fiddle with it and get the tuner just right so i can get a halfway decent sound out of it.    i would not recommend purchasing this product.  gave it 2-stars cuz the aesthetics arent bad and its pretty waterproof.  sound quality and tuning make this a paper weight for me.</li>
    <li> This radio is not super great. It died after a couple of weeks and now only makes a lovely whining noise when you turn it on. We also tried to replace the batteries but that was not the problem. Also, the radio tuner was really hard to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried tuning into any station with no success.  I missed the window to return this item but I DO NOT recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got this radio for my shower,it will not pick sound inside or outside the shower.I wish that I could get my money back but I have had it for to long.IF you want a good shower radio look at some other radio.I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly to keep me on time when in shower. The time does not stay visible and it never stays On Time. Its very strange, the display just disappears. I&#x27;ve changed the batteries twice!</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a birthday gift for my sister. It works great in my area. Crystal clear and very loud. It can definitely be heard when the shower is on.</li>
    <li> I bought this and it stopped tuning in to radio stations after 3 weeks.  The sound was also lousy.</li>
    <li> Very low price for what it does, but it doesn&#x27;t hold the FM channel. I constantly have to re-tune to the FM station.  The sound is terrible and the batteries do not last. Worst radio I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this radio in my shower for over a year and it works ok.  The battery is not very long for a small radio and the reception is touchy with the dial. And my radios clock doesn&#x27;t stay on time for very long; probably due to shorter battery life.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised and ahead of schedule! Radio had no reception in shower and wouldn&#x27;t stay attached to shower wall-would not recommend for purchase.</li>
    <li> I got this radio about a month ago, and it works great so far! The sound quality is good, just what you&#x27;d expect from a cheap radio, and I have no problem getting my station. You get what you pay for, but I&#x27;m perfectly happy with it.</li>
    <li> We spent four years together. I knew we weren&#x27;t a perfect match, but hey, I thought I would give it a chance. Mediocre sound, sensitive tuning, short battery life. The fact that I spent four years listening to you should indicate I hoped for more. It never came. I left you for a Sangean H201 Shower Radio. I think me and Sangean are a closer match.</li>
    <li> Considering this is a low cost item, and I truly believe you get what you pay for, this is a pretty decent little radio.  The stations were a little difficult to find (it&#x27;s very touchy), but once I found the station I wanted, I just left it there and have had no troubles.  I can hear it over the noise of the shower, and it works pretty darn well, especially considering the low price.  If you&#x27;re not picky about sound and just want something simple, this is a great little radio.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t pick up radio signals in shower room. or in hallway or near window.</li>
    <li> Husband uses it daily  just wishes the sound quality was better.  All stations are of poor quality every when moving it to different rooms</li>
    <li> This is the cheapest shower radio out there, but it&#x27;s not even worth the $10 list price.     This radio will not hold a station. You&#x27;re constantly tuning and trying to find the signal again (and this is not because I live in the middle of nowhere...I&#x27;m right downtown and all my other radios work great).    Not only that, but it also goes through three AAA batteries every week.     Finally, the knobs are almost impossible to work with wet fingers.    I&#x27;d skip it, and buy something else.</li>
    <li> Lasted several years. Everyday use: I replaced the AAA batteries roughly every few months. The suction cup didn&#x27;t aways grip so well (on a window) and if it fell down (which it did often) no permanent damage done, BUT the battery cover got out of wack. Battery cover is a screw-in plate; need a screwdriver (flat). Tuning is good. Volume button is temperamental. It&#x27;s a knob but I found that PUSHING it helped keep the volume up. (Otherwise it would fade low.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of working -- the reception started to get static-y. For some reason the antenna got loose, and I got fed up with it so before I chucked it completely, I decided to remove the antenna from the slot. Resolved my static issue! (Strange but true.) I listened for a few more years like this and then it lost all power. Great life for the price. At $10, it worked and I didn&#x27;t care about perfection. Would buy another.</li>
    <li> not bad for the price, it is tough to get reception sometimes or might only have a few stations to choose.</li>
    <li> The clock worked, but the radio didn&#x27;t. We ended up returning it. I looked for an inexpensive one but this is so cheap it isn&#x27;t even usable.</li>
    <li> Even with the antenna up this radio barely gets any radio stations. The last one we had got them clearly so it&#x27;s not a reception area thing. Spend a bit more $$ and get a better radio...wish I did!</li>
    <li> I live in nyc, with a million radio towers and never any problem picking up a signal from my house, but this thing cannot do anything but make annoying noise and avoid all radio stations .. do not buy its a complete waste !!!</li>
    <li> Ok, got this as a gift and it worked ok for about the first day with a little bit of patience..now it does not find any radio stations and the only way for it to play anything is if you push on the tuning dial. The dial is super touchy and any movement will fuzz up any radio station. If you have a ton of patience you can buy this but it does not last and the tuning dial sucks for getting any stations.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. This has a horrible design. The volume dial doesn&#x27;t even work half the time and every time you find your station you want the next time you turn it on its gone.</li>
    <li> I knew what I was buying. This brand has like a 50/50 probability of working. Maybe less. I needed something with the time on it for the shower. I would have loved the clock to work but it never did. I kept it because the radio works, for now. Didn&#x27;t feel like bothering with a return. But these are the most cheaply made shower/clock/radios ever.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care how cheap something is, it has to at least work without making you angry, and at this, this item fails.    Sound quality is barely acceptable.  You have to turn it up really loud to hear anything.  Talk radio is OK but you will not enjoy listening to music on this thing.    The sound cuts in and out and you have to constantly fiddle with the button, and it goes REALLY REALLY LOUD to (cut-off dead quiet).  No middle ground.    I nearly punched this thing through the wall today.    The reason why I am on Amazon today is I am going to buy a radio to replace this piece of garbage.    Still, 2 stars because at least it was very cheap.  Does that make sense?</li>
    <li> I purchased this shower radio because it was small and had suction cups to stick to the shower wall.  The problem was that it got barely any reception.    In addition, the sound quality was terrible, if you actually found a song you wanted to hear and you wanted to put it loud, it would become all garbled!  Don&#x27;t wast your money!!!</li>
    <li> Broke almost immediately.</li>
    <li> This is actually the worst thing so far I have bought off Amazon.  I read the specs and while I was not in love with it I did like the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just didn&#x27;t work.  I didn&#x27;t mind having to put batteries in it.  I did mind that I cannot find the clock battery anywhere so I never put one in.  No clock.  Not a terrible thing but I could have used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the volume dial was so bad that I never got to use this thing.  It has two settings - loud and off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Good Housekeeping claims it to be the 3rd best shower radio out there.  I would rather spend $50 and go for the Sony.</li>
    <li> I have bought two of these thing&#x27;s, the first one was bought and failed to work right away so I thought it had a problem. Bought the second one and it seamed to work for awhile, but it stopped working right after my return period expired, so I am stuck with two non-working units and I am annoyed. They weren&#x27;t placed anywhere by the actual water and they are obviously not water-proof. DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> I saw this at my local salvation army and decided to give it a try.  It has static and sometimes I must put it up high or on a desk to get the stations but I am loving this radio.  The static does not happen all the time at all and the stations come in good or great once I get it all the way on the station. I dont use it in the shower but I do use it near my wet sauna and infrared sauna.  It can be quite loud on the highest setting.  Great deal and I am satisfied.  If it quits, I would buy another one.  I got it for 2.99. One mans junk is anothers blessing. happy music listening everyone.</li>
    <li> I gave it three stars because it worked fine initially, but after a period of time it has a tendency to lose sound sporadically. The sound is good, but it&#x27;s frustrating to be listening to a story on the radio, and have it drop off for several seconds.</li>
    <li> This is the worst shower radio I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It&#x27;s dial is really tricky to work and get any good reception.  It&#x27;s frustrating and time consuming to deal with.  Spend a little more and get something better!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very unsatisfied overall with this shower radio.  I had a shower radio for many years that worked very well..  It wasn&#x27;t even a high quality radio but served the purpose well.  It finally died and I just replaced it with the Zadro ISing radio.  I read a few bad reviews about the Zadro ISing but I figured, how bad can it be?  Well, it&#x27;s bad.  The sound quality is horrible and the reception stinks.  Worst of all, I can&#x27;t hear it once the shower is running.  This radio might be good on a sidetable or on a desk somewhere as a small portable radio, but for the purpose of a shower-radio?? Forget it.</li>
    <li> Clock didn&#x27;t work. But the music played. :/</li>
    <li> It showed up on time and the fm radio works great but the clock doesn&#x27;t work which was a disappointment and it&#x27;ll often tune itself off the station that I would be listening to.</li>
    <li> Gave each of my 3 daughters one of these for Christmas.  One did not work right out of the box.  After one month in the shower, another stopped working.  Do not purchase!</li>
    <li> I had this in the past and it lasted a couple of years in the shower. Kind of hard to tune so usually left it on one station. Bought it again this time more for the clock than the radio, and the clock did not work. I returned it and was refunded right away.</li>
    <li> Station reception varies by where I am standing in the shower. The dials are smooth, so if your hands are wet you have to dig your fingernails into the little indentations on the dial. I don&#x27;t have long nails so it is tricky. People with larger fingers may find it even more challenging. The on/off/volume dial is very small so it takes extra diligence to make sure it has been turned off. I wouldn&#x27;t rate it as worth $15.00.</li>
    <li> I love my shower clock/radio.  It works great!  It helps me keep track of time when I&#x27;m getting ready. I also like that you can put it on the counter and it has a stand that flips out.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, looks cute in the shower. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was kind of nervous to get this with all the other reviews but it works great in my shower. I am able to pick up all local stations. The only down fall is you have to make sure and turn it all the way off or your batteries run down quickly.</li>
    <li> I had the previous iSing model and it worked great! Unfortunately, it fell one too many times and no it is broken. I purchased this POS thinking it would be the same quality. Soo wrong,&lt;br /&gt;You now need a separate battery for the clock. It is the little round watch-type battery. Mine arrived dead. I can live without the clock. The previous version the clock ran off of the 3 AAA batteries which powered the radio. I guess the trade off is that before you had to keep setting the clock once a month when the batteries died. Not sure about the new clock as the batteries were DEAD.&lt;br /&gt;The bigger, more unforgivable issue is that it can not hold a radio station! It keeps losing the channel and you constantly have to adjust the tuner to get the station back. What crap.&lt;br /&gt;Another smaller issue for some people would be that they removed the AM radio. Personally, I never listen to AM so this didn&#x27;t really bother me.&lt;br /&gt;Find something else. I am still looking.</li>
