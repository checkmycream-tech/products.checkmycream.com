      <li>It is uniquely shaped to allow free eye movement during your REM sleep cycle excellent for a great nights sleep, so you wake up feeling refreshed and energized ready to face the day.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what kind of sleeping mask</li>
      <li>I suppose the magnets create more circulation to the area and for me it was an amazing relief.</li>
      <li>The ear plugs have a nice travel case to be able to take them with you anywhere you</li>
      <li>I received the Magnetic sleeping mask very fast and it is a great sleeping mask.</li>

      <li>I was able to fall asleep and rest for a couple hours and when I woke my head was no longer hurting.</li>
      <li>What I like most about this eye mask is that the head strap is adjustable.</li>
      <li>i shouldn&#x27;t have to break-in or wait a month for an eye mask to be able to be worn without pain.</li>
      <li>But, sleep is deeper and more refreshing since I use this to block the light.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to enjoy sleep for awhile</li>
      <li>This mask is really great; it really does block all the light and is really comfortable.</li>
      <li>I did get this item complimentary  to review and give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
      <li>its comfortable help block the light for sure.</li>
      <li>While my eyes started feeling better, my temples and frontal lobe were on full attack.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a huge nose.</li>
      <li>Ear plugs as well, thankfully; because sound was no friend,</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know the elastic strap was too small</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing eye masks while I sleep since I was young and I was really intrigued when I read about this upgraded sleep mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Magnetic Sleep Mask plus ear plugs by Adella Skincare is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask has 16 bio-magnets built in it and is made of a very soft red flannel fabric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most sleep masks either fit or they don&#x27;t. You don&#x27;t have to worry about it fitting because it has an adjustable strap, so just adjust it to the perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask fully blocks out all light, so you can sleep peacefully and it helps you fall into a deep sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefits-&lt;br /&gt;-Helps remove wrinkles, puffy eyes and dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;-Shaped to allow free eye movement&lt;br /&gt;-Helps give you a restful sleep and leaves you feeling refreshed and stress free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> This mask claims to removes wrinkles, eliminates pouch, puffy eyes, and,dark circles, and etc, all with the help of the magnets inside the mask but over a long period of time. I do know that when used daily it has provided daily eye protection. It also relieves eye fatigue and dry eyes, acerbity, itching, pain, and discomfort symptoms. The magnets help teenager&#x27;s myopia, blurred vision, vision fatigue, etc. It is uniquely shaped to allow free eye movement during your REM sleep cycle excellent for a great nights sleep, so you wake up feeling refreshed and energized ready to face the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been sleeping with an eye mask off and on for about 2 years. I&#x27;ve always gotten better sleep with them. Now getting this one I can sleep even more better knowing that will help with tired and dry eyes. The magnetic beading in this helps with circulation and is to help with wrinkles. You can&#x27;t ask for anything better from your sleep mask. I think I&#x27;ve found my number one mask. Love the look and feel of it as well.  Thank you for this.&lt;br /&gt;I received this during a promo period for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Poor quality, shoddily made cheap product.</li>
    <li> Scratchy not comfortable</li>
    <li> I love this eye mask. I ordered one of these masks after reading the current research on the healing benefits of magnet therapy. I have suffered most of my life with terrible sinus issues and can barely breathe when I lie down to sleep. Since I received this mask, I have slept better than ever. No longer does the light bother me. The mask blocks out light and is so soft that I don’t even notice it on my face. It has an adjustable strap so that you can loosen and tighten it to your preference. I have had other masks not work as well as this one. I already have noticed how much better I breathe at night. I also get terrible headaches and began using this mask and it has helped so much. I won’t go to sleep now without wearing my mask. I can’t believe how comfortable this mask is to wear. My face normally gets irritated if I put anything on it and I was hesitant at first to purchase this mask, but I am so glad that I did. If you are wanting to benefit from the magnet therapy and get a good night’s sleep buy yourself one of these masks. They are very inexpensive as other similar masks costs almost twice as much. Every morning I feel energetic and well rested and I haven’t felt that in years. My eyes are not as puffy in the morning and my dark circles are starting to disappear. I would recommend this mask to anyone wanting to get a good night’s sleep.</li>
    <li> oh my!!! this is the best mask I own. I received it in the mail yesterday and slept like a baby last night. I love the earplugs that come with it. this way not only are you free from light, you are free from sound. I recommend this sleep mask for anyone who has issues sleeping. I give this a BIG TWO THUMBS UP!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am always dealing with puffy eyes all day long and some creams I&#x27;ve tried haven&#x27;t really worked early in the day. When I was offered this Magnetic Sleeping Eye Mask for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I decided to  give it a try. I didn&#x27;t really understand what made it magnetic until I opened my package and saw all the 16 mini magnets. I read the information about it and got it sized perfect for my head, and proceeded to fall asleep. The first thing I noticed about these that set it apart from other sleep masks is there was no velcro straps bothering me during the night. The next difference was obviously the magnets and the magic they perform over night. I couldn&#x27;t believe how great my eyes looked just from one night if sleeping with them! If you don&#x27;t want to use cream around your eyes to help with the puffiness, I recommend this Magnetic Sleeping Eye Mask!</li>
    <li> I should but I never write reviews but have to on this one!  I was looking for a sleep mask to block out light since my husband likes to leave the tv on at night and I like a pitch black room.  I tried a couple others but they were either too hot or the last one the strap was too tight (not adjustable) and caused a headache.  So when I came across this one I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I&#x27;m 33 years old with a few fine lines around my eyes so I thought I would try it.  Also, i have what a nurse told me once, longer than normal eye bags.  The length from my eye socket to the top of my cheek bone is longer than the normal so there was nothing medically I could really do about my puffy bags except surgery. Any injectable fillers would actually make them worse.  So, first night I slept with this mask, I woke up this morning without the normal headache and neck pain.  I usually take Tylenol as soon as I wake and crack my neck all day to release the tension.  Didn&#x27;t have to do that this morning.  I read the Pamphlet that came with the mask to my husband and bragged about no headache, etc.  When I said removed the puffiness around the eyes, he said &amp;#34;your eyes aren&#x27;t puffy&amp;#34;.  He is usually a smart ass by nature so I looked at him and said whatever he said &amp;#34;no they really aren&#x27;t!  You aren&#x27;t scaring me this morning.&amp;#34;  I looked in the mirror and I am amazed!  Under my eyes is completely flat!  I usually have a puffy bag that is at least an inch long and looks like I haven&#x27;t slept in a week.  I am truly impressed!  At around $10 I cannot believe the results.  After this review I will order a couple more just to have extras!!</li>
    <li> This mask ran a little small and and could have been a little more padded.  Other than that, it well worth its price.</li>
    <li> I really like this sleep mask. I never heard of a magnetic sleep mask until I was offered this one to review. I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would do anything that it said it would. I was surprised that while using I would wake up without the morning puffiness that I normally wake up to. My eyes also didn&#x27;t fell as tired and made waking up easier. It is made great and I love the size of the strap. The only downside it the strap is not adjustable. I receive a sample to review.</li>
    <li> Not as good quality as I expected, will probably be gifting to someone.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what kind of sleeping mask I will get for 10 dollars, but after trying it for a night i was happy i made this purchase. The mask blocks light entirely, and feels very comfortable. Going to use every night now. A great buy!</li>
    <li> Used several overnights no effect. Strap is not comfortable it&#x27;s rough edge cuts into the top part of your ear.</li>
    <li> This eye mask is a good idea at a good price but FOR ME it is not comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;The mask itself is verry stiff and i had to crunch/ smush it up several times so that it wouldn&#x27;t hurt my nose, the first nite i actually got a rubbing bruise from this mask.&lt;br /&gt;The band that goes arround the head hurts and rubs on my ears, it feels like it is sewn too far down on the sides of the mask if it was sewn closser to the top of the mask i think that would help.Also the part that lets you shorten or lengthen the strap falls right behind my ear and caused some of the discomfort so maybe if that part was behind the head or made of softer/rubber material instead of hard/rough plastic.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried every variation of where to put the strap that the seller has related to me (in their daily e-mails asking me to delete this review) up higher above the ear- didn&#x27;t even stay on my head, over the ear hurt worse than behind the ear and i even tried putting medical tape arround were it rubs my ears to try to cushion it but that didnt work either.&lt;br /&gt;As to weather or not it works i can&#x27;t say because when i have been able to put it on before sleep i wake up with it off-I am not sure how long it actually stays on, and i am still waking up with the headaches i had when i put on this eye mask.&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE IS THIS MASK MAY WORK FOR YOU, IT JUST HASEN&#x27;T FOR ME-i will keep trying to make it comfortable because i want it t work but i want something to be comfortable and usefull from day one- i shouldn&#x27;t have to break-in or wait a month for an eye mask to be able to be worn without pain.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many different eye masks over the years and so I figured what would it hurt to try one more to see what made it different from all the others.  What I like most about this eye mask is that the head strap is adjustable. It gives you the freedom of wearing it tight or loose, whatever makes you comfortable. When the mask is used along with the included ear plugs you can get a quiet yet dark nights sleep. The mask has a soft velvet like feel which I really love.</li>
    <li> This eye mask is garbage. After a few weeks the magnets start sticking together because they seem to be poorly glued inside the eye mask. Also it&#x27;s clearly made for smaller heads. Even with the adjustable elastic band, it is highly uncomfortable, and I wake up each morning with a rash around the ear area.</li>
    <li> Having a husband that snores and suffering from migraines is an issue for me. I can not sleep at night when my husband sleeps so I have to sleep during the day, which is sometimes hard to do so I suffer from insomnia quite often. I use sleep masks often to help me with the insomnia and to help relieve the migraines and headaches that I get on an almost daily basis. I have always just used them during the day to help block out light when I am trying to sleep or get rid of a migraine, sometimes it helps sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However this is much different from any of the other sleep masks that I have tried. I have never used a magnetic sleep mask so I decided to try it out because I remember a few years back hearing about magnetic therapy being used for different pain issues. I had another one of my migraines come on and instead of grabbing for the other sleep masks that I own I got this one out. I did take a couple of my migraine pills before hand. I laid down and put this on. Its a very soft comfortable material. It was not tight on my head and was comfortable to use. Within an hour my migraine was started to diminish. I was able to fall asleep and rest for a couple hours and when I woke my head was no longer hurting. Now if it was the magnets or not I can not say but I can say that I was able to rest wearing this and that when I awoke my pain was gone, whether it be from the magnets or just that I was actually able to rest better. Either way I was pain free and happy :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product Free of charge for the purpose of inspecting and reviewing. All statements made are 100% of my own based on my personal experiences with this product.</li>
    <li> what a peaceful sleep! i received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. wow i really got a peaceful restful sleep with out the worry of a headache when i woke up. i frequently get headaches and migraine headaches from a car accident that messed up my spine and other things so anything to relieve the headaches in the morning when i wake up is a plus. i am super impressed with this magnetic sleep mask by Adella. there are so many benefits from magnetic therapy but i had never tried it before and wow i am sold. this sleep mask is made very well with a plush velvet feel outer fabric that is of a nice dark shade making your sleep mask not only dark but soft and comfy. also along with the comfort and fabulous style of the sleep mask is the benefits of the magnetic therpy actions included. the black out from the sleep mask effect made me rest easier and relax my facial muscle s...see my hubby like to watch tv and movies at night to go to sleep and that doesnt help with the headaches or help with me a busy mom of 6 trying to go to sleep ...this mask is amazing of how it blocked all the light out and i could actually rest my head, face, eyes, everything,,,thank you so much ..i love this sleep mask!!</li>
    <li> Wow is all that I can say!!! I had never heard of a Magnetic Sleeping Eye Mask, but after reading the description, I was intrigued to try it.  I was very impressed with the results.  The magnets help to reduce puffy eyes, and I have noticed that my dark circles are starting to fade.  It helps me get a great night sleep, with no light coming in, as my husband sleeps with the television on, and the light can keep me awake.  I also suffer from headaches, so this is great when I get a migraine as it keeps all light out and helps to get rid of the headache.  I highly recommend this, as it is more than just an eye mask.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I did not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.

    <li> I tried this for a week or two and slept well about half of nights but experienced severe insomnia the other half. I&#x27;m not sure if the mask had anything to do with that, but it might have. I stopped using it because it didn&#x27;t fit well, and caused an uncomfortable sensation as it pressed against my eyes. I went back to my good old bucky blinks mask which is contoured for comfort but keeps the light out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this magnetic sleeping mask for a week now and I have to say its short of a miracle. I have trouble getting to sleep and sleeping through the night, but since I now wear the mask I have been falling in such a deep sleep, its amazing. I have no idea how it works, but I really recommend this product for anyone who has trouble sleeping. I also used it during the day when I wanted to get extra sleep and I really slept so deeply and it blocked out all the light in my room which was great.</li>
    <li> Only complaint, is the bottom part of this, where it fits over your nose. It does not have the same curvature as the picture shows. So for me, it&#x27;s uncomfortable on my nose. I don&#x27;t have a huge nose. Or a tiny nose either. But It was feeling squished while I was trying to fall asleep. I like that the mask makes everything black. Minus the nose issue, I like the weight of it on the eyes and it&#x27;s comfortable. I did wake up in middle of night though and the mask was pushed up onto my forehead. I did receive this as a promotional product. And I must say, it was suppose to be delivered Friday. I received it a day early. I&#x27;m very pleased with the quickness.</li>
    <li> Came in the mail the other day. Its itchy and uncomfortable and prevented me from getting a good nights sleep. Not worth the money.</li>

    <li> This is not overly comfortable.  No real cutout for the nose. It blocks out the light.  I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Quite satisfied. Might be a little too warm, but I live in Florida and lots of things are too warm. I like it because I can open my eyes behind it and it&#x27;s comfortable. I do seem take it off during the night on occasion. But, sleep is deeper and more refreshing since I use this to block the light.</li>
    <li> I had to cut the mask because it put to much pressure on my nose. I did not find it to help with sleep mostly because it was not comfortable and I no longer use this product.</li>
    <li> Does not cover the eyes well.  Even when on the light still goes through them.</li>
    <li> We bought 3 for family members.  They are comfortable and have additional positive effects.  My son and spouse have allergies that often cause them to have headaches and/or stuffy sinuses.  They have both confirmed an ease in breathing when they sleep and my son&#x27;s morning headaches are gone. We all find a more restful sleep.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Put red dye on my very pricey pillow light colored cases and it won&#x27;t come out, needless to say, extremely unhappy.</li>
    <li> I feel the eye mask is very helpful when I&#x27;m trying to got to sleep after a long day at school.</li>
    <li> I loved it. Perfect for me. Provides Blackout and I feel the magnets are doing its job.</li>
    <li> I received the Magnetic sleeping mask very fast and it is a great sleeping mask. I am very happy that I ordered it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> It is nice that it does reduce the stress in my eyes but the material is stiff, I would keep waking up in the middle of the night just to take it off, can&#x27;t sleep on your side tough material only good for naps</li>
    <li> Amazing. Took my migraine headaches away after 3 nights of sleep.</li>
    <li> its comfortable help block the light for sure.</li>
    <li> Great and comfortable</li>
    <li> This is great mask it use it all the time. I love it because when you put it on your face it is magnetic so if you toss and turn and move around it stays on your face. That is great because I have never liked the other mask because they fall off every move you make. Thanks for making a great item like this.</li>
    <li> gott this for free when they were running a promo i highly recommend best night sleep i had in a long time</li>
    <li> I suffer from insomnia and I need my room to be completely dark in order to sleep.  We have blackout curtains but I feel like even with them it&#x27;s just not enough.  This mask is so comfortable and trust me I&#x27;m typically not a mask wearer as I feel like I&#x27;m being smothered.  I think that the magnets have actually been helping my stress headaches.  I was able to get this for a promotional price but I think it&#x27;s well worth the full amount.</li>
    <li> We took a little trip to visit my family this weekend – they warned us when we walked in that they were recovering from a stomach bug and everything was going straight through them. I (ridiculously) joked “Give me some of THAT!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They told me I didn’t want it. My immune system disagreed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days later I was in misery. I really felt bad for my little ones, they had a mild case but I still felt responsible and terrible. Even worse, the next day; when I had a migraine that would not quit. Was worse when I did anything but lie down, which is everything my children wanted to prevent me from doing when they got their appetites back, needed me for everything…as under the weather dollbabies do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next night, I was able to fix dinner – some chicken &amp; rice – hoping it would be easy on our tummies. Yet my brain still wanted to burst from my forehead . I was literally near tears when I remembered a product I had recently received at a discount to review. How lucky, because it happened to be a magnetic sleep mask and light was my new enemy. Ear plugs as well, thankfully; because sound was no friend, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put them both to work right away. While my eyes started feeling better, my temples and frontal lobe were on full attack. I slid the mask up on my face and was able to rest peacefully…and as soundly as possible with a toddler in arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning I awoke a new person. Was it possible? Could I really feel so normal just hours since my skull was rejecting my sinus cavity? Apparently so…maybe all the gatorade and chicken soup had finally combined to create this magical healing effect but it could be no coincidence that the pressure in my face where the mask remained felt amazing. I suppose the magnets create more circulation to the area and for me it was an amazing relief. In no time I was scrubbing the teen’s sink and steam mopping the tots playroom. Ah, living the dream.</li>
    <li> This mask does not fit snugly over the nose and so the light comes in at sunrise which makes it useless really.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I was able to relax and get some good sleep using this! As a mom of a baby and a toddler I wasn&#x27;t able to enjoy sleep for awhile but with this mask and the ear plugs I finally got some rest.</li>
    <li> I  use it ,and I like it. I want order other ,but I not see on the list.I want order again.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> too small and I can&#x27;t return it</li>
    <li> very good quality for the price, I have paid much more and the quality was not near as good as this one.</li>
    <li> I wear it all the time. Not sure if it works..</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is very soft to the touch and once you have it on, you don&#x27;t even know there are magnets in it.  Magnets are suppose to help with many different ailments, I haven&#x27;t had this mask long enough to speak to what it can do physically for me but it absolutely has helped me achieve a full nights sleep. My husband wakes very early and the lights often wake me up. Once I started wearing this mask I was able to sleep straight through. The ear plugs are an added bonus since my husbands snores terribly. They are comfortable and great at blocking out that terrible snoring.  I am giving this product four stars only because some of the elastic band is coming off after only a short time (see picture).  I was given this product for my review.</li>
    <li> I have tried sleep masks in the past, but always had trouble with them making my face red or making it sweat. When asked to test and honestly review this product during a promotion, I was a little hesitant. This mask is really great; it really does block all the light and is really comfortable. The adjusting strap makes it fit my head just right. I am not sure exactly if the magnets are doing anything, but I definitely get better sleep with the mask on than with it off. I am sure part of the reason is how light my bedroom is due to heaters having numbers on them that always project light. The ear plugs that come with the mask are a great added bonus and block out at least a little bit of noise – my cats are very loud so I am not sure exactly how much noise it would block out for a normal household. My eyes have not been as puffy and the black rings are starting to disappear, but I am sure that has to do with the better quality of sleep I am getting due to this mask.</li>
    <li> I like the mask. It keeps the light out. I do not think the magnetic do anything though. However, it was a bit expensive for a mask and is nothing special.</li>
    <li> This works wonderfully! The dark color keeps the light out to a perfection. The soft feel of having this mask on is amazing and relaxing all at the same time. I need something because I have been working very late nights at work and trying to take some naps during the day the next day. This has done the trick. I have had issues with other masks that felt like it as rubbing the side of my face, this one was very nice. Very pleased with the eye mask. I highly recommend this to others looking for some daytime naps.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful magnetic eye mask.  It would be a lovely gift for a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time trying a magnetic eye mask.  I have researched a lot obout magnets.  They are great for your health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with ear plugs.  The ear plugs have a nice travel case to be able to take them with you anywhere you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eye mask is a pretty purple wine color.  It&#x27;s made of a velveteen material and is super soft.  It has 16 magnets in it but you do not feel them at all while wearing it.  It&#x27;s very light weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it to try to get a full night&#x27;s sleep and if it helps eliminate wrinkles and puffy and dark circles under my eyes that&#x27;s even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a nap during the day since I didn&#x27;t get a lot of sleep last night.  I usually don&#x27;t nap because I feel worse when I wake up.  I tried this mask for my nap.  It was very comfortable.  The strap was thick and adjustable.  I forgot I even had it on.  I actually woke up feeling better and refreshed.  I felt like I had a good couple hrs of rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend.  I did get this item complimentary  to review and give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I have trouble getting to sleep and sleeping through the night, but since I now wear the mask I have been falling in such a deep sleep, its amazing.  I have no idea the science behind all of it, but I do have to say it is working great.  The mask blocks out light and is so soft that I don’t even notice it on my face. It has an adjustable strap so that you can loosen and tighten it to your preference.  It comes with ear plugs, I don&#x27;t use them, mainly because I have kids and I want to be able to hear if something happens at night.  But If i&#x27;m traveling I will definitely put them to use.  The mask is pretty soft and looking at one side, you can see the 16 magnets this mask contains. While wearing this mask, you don&#x27;t feel these magnets at all.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a full night sleep and feel refreshed in the morning, get this mask.  I completely recommend it!!&lt;br /&gt;  I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad. My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.</li>
    <li> Great product! The seller was very kind.</li>
    <li> The buckle on the elastic hurts when I lie down. I have a small head and  think this is a little too tight even in its loosest position. I did not notice any benefits from the magnets.</li>
