<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This size is good for my smaller adult mouth. It fits the body of the brush, which also fits into my (smaller) hands comfortably.</li>
    <li> While the kids sonicare toothbrushes are easy to find the replacement heads have become elusive. I was not able to find them in any of the typical stores. The price through Amazon was what I expected, what I usually paid at Wal Mart. The brush heads are they exact same I usually buy and fit perfect.</li>
    <li> I needed some new brush heads for our child&#x27;s toothbrush. It really is one of the best toothbrushes out there for kids.</li>
    <li> I bought many replacements for my kids&#x27; Sonicare toothbrush.  Great product but I wish it would be a little cheaper.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are a perfect fit and excellent price. I will  most definitely order them online again via amazon.com.</li>
    <li> My son started using this when he got his braces.  Works very well and has a 30 second time so easy for him to know when his two minutes is up!</li>
    <li> These work well and as described. These make brushing my kids teeth easier and they do an excellent job. The prices on Amazon for these are generally the best. They can fluctuate quite a lot so it is important to watch them.</li>
    <li> Good product and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement heads for sonicare toothbrush.  My son has used this tooth brush for over a year and it does help to form a good habit of brushing teeth.</li>
    <li> Performs as expected.  Great that I don&#x27;t have to think about ordering more.&lt;br /&gt;Nice that 2 colors/pack.  Would be even nicer if there were more color choices.</li>
    <li> This is great, and the heads last about 5 months or so before needing replacement.  definitely helps make teeth-brushing for children easier.</li>
    <li> I CAN ALWAYS SEEM TO FIND A BETTER PRICE FOR THESE ON AMAZON THAN IN THE STORES.  ALOS HARD TO FIND THIS LARGER KID SIZE IN STORES.</li>
    <li> Could not find these replacement brush heads at my local Walmart and saw them on Amazon for a better price. When I received them I was pleasantly surprised that they are both big kids sized. My kids have outgrown the ones available at the stores.</li>
    <li> Thanks to these fine quality toof brush heads, my children will not appear to have meth mouth despite the fact they drink a six pack each of Monster energy drinks for breakfast.</li>
    <li> It might seem early for a kid of 8 (now 9) to use an electric toothbrush of the quality and sophistication provided by Sonicare.  Not at all.  We are very glad we tried it.  The difference between regular toothbrushes and the Sonicare is entirely visible.  Our son&#x27;s teeth are a gorgeous white, and proof of what made the difference is that when, without realizing it, the toothbrush had been accidentally reset to the shorter, entry-level cycle, we wondered after a few days why his teeth were not looking so great.  I checked the brush and found the error, reset and within a couple of days his teeth were looking fabulous again.  Like we adults, after using the Sonicare for a while it feels yucky to him to use a regular toothbrush again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We travel a bit and the toothbrush holds its charge for up to about two and a half weeks.  The charger is easy to transport.  The subscription service we use with Amazon is great.</li>
    <li> I bought the kids toothbrush for me, and I am a grown-up.  I love it and have been using it for a long time.  It was so hard to get the replacement heads where I live so I was so pleased to find them here on Amazon.  I change mine often and its convenient because they are available on a subscription basis.  They will just arrive at the time you need them.  LOVE.</li>
    <li> For all of you out there who love this toothbrush for your kids but hate the price of the replacement heads, the diamondclean line of heads work fine for the kids brushes too!  I just bought the 6 pack at Costco for $24 (so that&#x27;s $4 per head) and tried it on my kids brushes and it fits.  Funny sonicare doesn&#x27;t let you know about this....they are making tons of extra money on people who think they have to pay $10 per replacement head for their kids.</li>
    <li> These fit great. The walmart replacements are a bit loose. You can really compare to manual brushes. This is a great brush that helps children brush better.</li>
    <li> Since I use the toothbrush that requires these replacement heads, I will say that they perform as expected and arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> Finally found what I need for the kids toothbrushes! This is a 2 pack of the same size toothbrush head to fit the kids Sonicare toothbrush. It originally came with one small head and one large but I could not find that combo anywhere for replacement. Now I have an extra in this size</li>
    <li> I got these for my kids and they work great. According to my youngest, they are dirty. But that comment strikes me as an excuse to not brush his teeth.</li>
    <li> these need to be replaced every 3 months, the replacements are great, never worry about the fit or any design changes!</li>
    <li> We have since upgraded our kids&#x27; toothbrush to an adult brush. What I don&#x27;t like about these brush heads is that they come in only the pair. If I want a brush head for each child, I&#x27;d have to buy 2 pairs because they&#x27;re the same age. I wish they offered buying one size or the other in multipacks.</li>
    <li> It came packaged nicely, looks brand new.  I was a bit concerned, considering it&#x27;s a tooth brush but they work great.</li>
    <li> Have been buying these replacement brush heads for a couple years. My last shipment had a brush head in the sealed package that was missing bristles in one of the holes. Never had that happen before. Otherwise, happy with product.</li>
    <li> I searched everywhere for a cheaper version, looked at Costco (where we get our e-series heads) and NOTHING.  I took a chance on a 3-pack of &amp;#34;GENERIC Philips Sonicare HX6013/66 Pro Results Brush Heads&amp;#34; on eBay for $7.  Surprise! They fit &amp; work great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is less than a 1mm gap between the bottom of the brush head plastic base and the toothbrush body, but it makes it easier to pull off the head that way.  These brush heads don&#x27;t fit very snugly on the brush stand, but that&#x27;s no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering that we had a Philips Sonicare HX6042/64 replacement brush head break at its base (had to super-glue it) the generics are an all-around better deal.</li>
    <li> It is the replacement head for the Kids sonicare, so if that is what you are looking for then you will be happy with is product.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent toothbrush for kids.  They don&#x27;t always brush that great, and this really helps assure a good brushing.  I&#x27;m very thankful my son has it!  I have so much trouble finding these replacement heads in my area though!  I&#x27;m so happy Amazon had them, and at such a great price!  I would definitely order these again!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Fit perfectly on our Philips Sonicare Kids toothbrush.  Now if i could just get the kid to use it!</li>
    <li> Would like it better if they did not package two different sizes together (small with larger kid sizes). as the smaller one is a waste as your kids get older.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been using this toothbrush for months now.  Her teeth are noticeably whiter and they actually look cleaner!</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous when purchasing these products but I&#x27;m use to seeing two heads in a package at the store and these didn&#x27;t look the same. This product is the same as the ones in the store. Fits the Sonicare Kids electric toothbrushes just fine. I was hoping it was the combo pack or 1 for a 5 yr old and 1 for a 10 yr old, but this package contains two of the same size brushes so if you have  the heads for two different age groups you are looking at purchasing another pack but the good side is that you will be covered for the next yr.</li>
    <li> OK, those are just brush heads, but using a brush like this, makes them really brush easy. Mine is jumping in front of the mirror, where it looks like that he uses his electrical brush as a microphone, although it is in his mouth ;-) To make sure that it keeps doing the job, I replace the heads every 2-3 months. The good thing with Amazon and ordering online, is that it also happens: when you see that he needs new ones. Directly order them online. When I need to buy them in a shop, I will always forget it. In this way at the moment: zero cavity !!</li>
    <li> Great, wish they had more colors.  Not much more to say, wow, way too many words required.  Almost there. done.</li>
    <li> The Kids teeth in good condition thanks in part to this toothbrush. Can&#x27;t ask for more from it can I?</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my kids Sonicare toothbrush. I like the fact that the two brush heads are red and blue. The two colors are very easy to tell apart so my kids won&#x27;t get their brushes mixed up. Will be back for more when they are needed.</li>
    <li> Needed replacement heads and could not find them in the stores (why?).  My boys, however, were hoping for &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; colored ones.  Blue does the job.</li>
    <li> These heads are a perfect size for my 8 year old son. The different colors are nice for when my youngest child gets one of these brushes. No confusion!</li>
    <li> These are so overpriced!  Not just on Amazon but everywhere.  You are better off getting the adult Sonic care for you kids just to save on the heads.  It will pay for itself in a few years as you save on the heads.</li>
    <li> Just like in the store.  I love these</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for...couldn&#x27;t find them in the store anymore where I purchased the toothbrush originally. Glad I can still get them here.</li>
    <li> These are high quality replacements that are a perfect fit. Also the price on amazon is way better than at the local store.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Fast shipping. Highly recommended!</li>

    <li> needed age 7+, and all I could find at the store was the ones with the two different heads....&lt;br /&gt;expensive but i needed to purchase them and didn&#x27;t know where else to look</li>
    <li> These do the job and are a good size for my seven year old&#x27;s mouth. I love that they are on subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> its sonicare, what else can you say ;)&lt;br /&gt;Since my children started using this toothbrush, NO CAVITIES!!! well worth every penny</li>
    <li> We love this product!  We are planning on getting a second toothbrush for our other children as well.  Cleans their teeth perfectly!</li>
    <li> Our entire family uses Sonicare brushes - our dentist recommends them and the hygienist can tell the difference between those that use Sonicare and a regular brush when it comes to cleaning time - there&#x27;s no comparison.  We started our young son on the kids Sonicare brush and the replacement brush heads are needed.  Wish they were cheaper, and I wish you could get them in larger packs to keep the price down even further, but they work great.</li>
    <li> We have the sonicare for our kids.  This product is the replacement heads needed.  We replace them every 6 months.  It&#x27;s so easy getting them online</li>
    <li> good buy would buy again</li>
    <li> Love the toothbrush for my kids - I feel better knowing that they are getting a good cleaning  w/o them having the skills to brush up and down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hardest part is these brushes are $8 to $9 each for the heads !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are following the Gillette model way and it should not be so high !</li>
    <li> I have these auto delivered every 3 months to keep the brushes fresh on my kids sonicare&#x27;s they work well and are small and soft enough for small mouths.</li>
    <li> I love the Sonicare for kids toothbrush.  With the integrated timer, and powerful brushing action...this is the only way I can ensure that my kids do a thorough job of cleaning their teeth.  These brush heads are a perfect match.  Highly recommended for regular toothbrush maintenance.</li>
    <li> Hard not to meet expectations, it is a replacement head from the manufacturer if the tooth brush.  We like the sonic are for kids, as do the kids.</li>
    <li> Easy to snap on and off for cleaning.  Soft bristles for sensitive kids gums.  Will purchase these replacements again in 3 - 4 months</li>
    <li> Our whole family has a sonicare toothbrush and loves them. My kids have the kids brush and use these replacement heads. The heads need to be replaced at least every 3 months or the toothbrush isnt doing the job.These replacement heads are great and come in a 2 pack for both my kids. Recommend</li>
    <li> I love the Phillips Sonicare toothbrush for my kids.  They are now 9years old, and have never had a cavity.  The Sonicare makes it much easier to keep them brushing appropriately.  Unfortunately the replacement brushes are expensive, so it was great to find them at this price!  Their teeth are worth it!!</li>
    <li> Kids love it.  Makes for great &amp; healthy teeth for the young ones.  This is also a fair price and value.</li>
    <li> These replacements are the real thing. Never had a problem with them.</li>
    <li> Think the Sonicare line has something here by making an electric brush just for kids.  After using this their dental reports are better and we don&#x27;t have to encourage them to brush. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> purchased these replacement brush heads for my children. They both have braces and use the water pick daily. Couldn&#x27;t find replacement heads for this sonicare model in stores. Like that they are different colors so they are distinguishable. very pleased with purchase. would recommend.</li>
    <li> This was a great replacement item... Have set up on standing order so get brush heads at regular interval. Just what our dentist ordered.</li>
    <li> We all know how hard it is to get our kids to brush not only for the full two minutes but also to do a good job brushing. Using these brush heads with the kids sonicare allows them to do just that.</li>
    <li> I was at wits end trying to get my kid to brush her teeth right.  She has her dad&#x27;s weak teeth and was lazy about brushing.  This toothbrush helps her not get more cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The refills are the right fit for the Sonicare for Kids toothbrush.  They&#x27;re lasting and do not fall apart.  They fit on well (just pull up on the old one and it slides off, then slide the new one on)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t get these in my area, so I&#x27;m glad amazon carries them :)</li>
    <li> I love sonicare.  All their products are amazing.  The two minute timer for the kids to brush is great, great.</li>
    <li> My 7 year old son love it. Very easy for him to handle a tooth brush. Just remember to order a replacement before it wears off.</li>
    <li> Amazon has the best price I could find on these replacement tooth brush heads for my kids. They love using these toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Same price as Walmart, but with the ease of shipping to my homw. Cleans well, but wears out quickly. My 5 and 9 year old use them.</li>
    <li> Right sized handle with interchangable decorative faceplates.  Good size brush head with music chimes that indicate moving around the mouth. My son actually loves to brush the full time.</li>
    <li> Product looks and works as described.  Kids enjoy brushing their teeth with the Sonicare for Kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of weeks of use, it appears some of the bristles are coming out... just a few.  Not sure if this is normal or not.</li>
    <li> These work well but the price is outrageous.&lt;br /&gt;Basically they are sticking it to parents who need a smaller brush head for kids.&lt;br /&gt;Charging 50% more than the same 50 cents worth of plastic for adults, nice.</li>
    <li> After going through a bunch of battery powered toothbrushes that you have to throw away when the brush is worn out, I was feeling bad about the waste.  The Sonicare for Kids was a great investment and Amazon&#x27;s subscription service, I get the 2-pack of replacement brush heads about every 5 months or so without having to think about it.</li>
    <li> I received exactly what I ordered.  These seem to work really well for my 7 yr old.  I like that the kids brush heads are sized right for their mouths.</li>
    <li> These were hard to find in stores in the Minneapolis area.  They are over-priced but my son does a better job of brushing his teeth with an electric so I&#x27;m happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order came withing a few days.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Phillips Sonicare toothbrush for several years now and have been very impressed as to how much better it cleans my teeth.  I bought a kid&#x27;s version for my grandson when he was 6 (what an amazing grandfather I am!!!) especially as it had brush heads for different ages.  Although not the world&#x27;s most exciting present, he found it fun to have an electric toothbrush and so uses it more often and more readily than he used his ordinary brush.  So in the long run it is a present that will have a good impact.  I bought these replacements because now he is old enough for the next level of brush.  Yes, they are not cheap compared to normal toothbrushes but the fact that he readily uses it and his teeth are cleaner is worth the price, don&#x27;t you think?</li>

    <li> I love the fact that there are two to a package.  I change my son&#x27;s brush head every 3 months.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush head is technically &amp;#34;for kids&amp;#34; as it will fit the kid&#x27;s toothbrush.  However, the head is NOT the kid sized one.</li>
    <li> this was recommended by 11 yr old grandson&#x27;s dentist;  it&#x27;s making improvements to his oral hygiene attempts</li>
    <li> Great product my kids always get an A+ at the dentist. Great price and fast delivery.  Also easy to use and kid friendly size.</li>
    <li> just toothbrush heads cheaper than grocery store. My son is 14 and needs the older sizes not the combo pack for his mouth. so this was great deal</li>
    <li> My 6-year-old son has been using Philips sonicare for 3 years and he is keen to brush his teeth with it. Those brushes can reach almost all sides of his teeth and clean them very good.</li>
    <li> Was having a hard time finding the replacements at the store. Received product and fit perfectly into toothbrush. Daughter loves using her toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I was looking to replace the the toothbrush on my 8 year old son Sonicare toothbrush. He had the toothbrushes that fit a 4-7 year old mouth. I could not find this size at my local walmart so I looked on Amazon and found them! Plus they were three dollars cheaper than walmart and I received free two day shipping since I have Amazon Prime membership. Awesome!</li>
    <li> So convenient to find them at amazon with the replacement heads I needed for my sonicare adult brush as well</li>
    <li> It fits Philips Sonicare kids brush as advertised since these heads are made by Philips.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this toothbrush if you haven&#x27;t already bought one.  One of kids use a generic kids electric toothbrush just fine.  That toothbrush was a lot cheaper than the replacement head.</li>
    <li> My son likes it.  Good product.</li>
    <li> The reason why the price on this model is so expensive is that it&#x27;s been discontinued by Philips.  Philips no longer distinguishes these by age group (4-7 or 7-10), but they now sell kids toothbrush heads in Compact or Standard size.  Search for models HX6032 or HX6042, and the price is back to $10/head.  Still expensive, but much less so...</li>
    <li> Our dentist suggested that instead of buying the expensive &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; brush, we buy this one which does exactly the same thing. It works great for our family! The kid loves it and both parents use it with &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; brushes.</li>
    <li> My family has a history of poor dental health no matter how well we clean our teeth. These sonicare brushes really get the job done!</li>
    <li> Good by my, and great that they offered both colors in one pack so not on ly does my boy love the tooth brush, he has a blast mixing it up with the colors whie brushing.  Not a necessaity but awesome enough to provide even more encouragement for the kid to brush.</li>
    <li> Fits the ridiculously expensive toothbrush that was purchased for the kid...  Her dentist recommended it to train the kids how long to brush for.  The kid&#x27;s mother decided to buy it...  Then you need to buy these replacement heads that fit kid sizes every couple months.  Well I found them here on Amazon.  Not sure if we&#x27;re going to keep going with this system or not.  I never had a motorized tooth brush, and I didn&#x27;t get my first cavity until I was in my 20s.  I don&#x27;t know if we will be buying any further replacements.</li>
    <li> I love the sonicare toothbrush for kids.  I have bought one for each of my grandchildren.  Their teeth stay much cleaner, and they think it is fun to brush.  Billiie Nicks - registered Dental Hygienist, retired.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t for me , however the person that wanted it needed it for a replacement so I&#x27;m sure she was pleased.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  Fits my 7 and 8 year old perfectly.  Highly recommend as replacement for sonic care brushes.</li>
    <li> My son has been using it for over a year.  He likes it.  The replacement heads are, in my opinion, too expensive and very hard to find locally (they cost about $10 a brush head even online).  We are thinking about switching to the Oral B Pro Health for Kids 8+ Electric Toothbrush for that reason.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Really like the Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Sonicare for kids it a great thing.  This helps so much with the dentist visits &amp; build up on the lazy brusher&#x27;s teeth :-)  Good find.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have a four and seven year old and they both use the Sonicare.  These refills are the perfect size for them.</li>
    <li> I have the sonicare for my daughter in the hopes that it will get her teeth more clean than the manual toothbrush. Not much to say about these heads, other than I&#x27;m glad I can throw them in the dishwasher to sanitize (per my pediatrician) rather than having to toss the whole thing (like my sonicare battery-operated toothbrush).</li>
    <li> After a bunch of cavities, I got the sonicare and have way less. :) My kids like their brushes and I love how you can order them to come every so often. It reminds me to change their toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> They work as advertised.  Fits my kid&#x27;s teeth which is important for good brushing.  I just wish they were more affordable.</li>
    <li> Love the price of this item. It is cheaper to buy on line than in stores.  This is my third purchase off these and have never had a problem!</li>
    <li> These are great for brushing my kids teath.  No more disposable tooth brushes anymore.  Give it a try today! Ok</li>
    <li> My son loves brushing his teeth now.  These brush heads are great.  The sonicare system is simply wonderful and I am so glad that my son loves it too!</li>
    <li> Purchased these cheaper online than what I would have to pay for 1 from a store.  I think the Philips Sonicare toothbrush system for kids is great!</li>
    <li> My grandchildren have had perfect checkups since they began using these toothbrushes. It takes the guesswork and inefficient brushing out of the picture for kids. It does the work for them. The bristles are comfortable too.</li>
    <li> Ordered this as a replacement. Works great. Seems to last quite well in addition. Could not be more pleased. Quality product.</li>
