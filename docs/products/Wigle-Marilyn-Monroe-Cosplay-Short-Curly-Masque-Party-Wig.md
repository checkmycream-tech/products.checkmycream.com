      <li>She&#x27;s worn it many times.</li>
      <li>I love this wig alot.</li>
      <li>Very well made wig and great feel.</li>
      <li>Many people didn&#x27;t recongnizes me ecspecially while I was in cosplay as Dave Strider.</li>
      <li>I would say I am writing my review now because I wanted more experience with wigs before I wrote this.</li>
      <li>I might have been able to trim it to suit, but it didn&#x27;t matter - it couldn&#x27;t stay on, so there was no reason to try and make it work.</li>
      <li>she&#x27;s a drama queen never laying still though I thank you guys for sending a wig cap it make&#x27;s putting the wig on more easyer</li>
      <li>I love how I can cosplay now, and it looks just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
      <li>I managed to cover most of it</li>
      <li>Searched this up to see how many Dave&#x27;s bought this.</li>
      <li>You can manage to make it look alright, if you put a beanie on, or keep a hood up, because the front of the hair I love.  </li>
      <li>I must say I was pretty impressed with the quality and that it actually looks good on her.</li>
      <li>It came at a decent time,  the wig doesn&#x27;t look EXACTLY like the one in the picture,  but it&#x27;s still great!</li>
      <li>Luckily it already fits nicely on my head.</li>
      <li>I was worried it would be more of a cheap party wig</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m fine with how it is.</li>
      <li>when my wig got here it came as all wigs do in a wig bag with a free wig cap</li>
      <li>THE BANGS ARE REALLY SHORT but great for Dave Strider cosplay</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also about as comfortable as a wig can get.</li>
      <li>It is a comfortable wig though I do give it that.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic color</li>
      <li>, this scores a 15%.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend that you NEVER buy this wig for cosplay, but if you&#x27;re a parents looking for a fun, one time use wig, this might be okay.</li>
      <li>It was great though for my Dave Strider cosplay, plus I can use it for many other cosplays as well.</li>
      <li>First of all it came three weeks early which was great.</li>
      <li>Was not disappointed 😏</li>
      <li>Using this at Comic con this year :)</li>
      <li>I am more then positive</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>The wig came in quick and doesn&#x27;t seem to shed.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my daughter who has very long hair, and this covered her own hair well and the hair is very full looking.</li>
      <li>It is exactly as described and fits comfortably.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft and shiny, yet super easy to put on and brush!</li>
      <li>it was exactly what I wanted, but try as I might I couldn&#x27;t make it fit</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s not a hard fix :)</li>
      <li>It only works for Rose...</li>
      <li>Will wear well and be useful for costumes of all kinds.</li>
      <li>Is it worth the buy?</li>
      <li>It is ok, way too big for my head..</li>
      <li>Sadly, no matter how I tried to style it, the wig just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
      <li>Its exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I will be making future purchases from them! :)</li>
      <li>Sure enough, as soon as I opened it, it glistened, exactly like a wig from a party store.  </li>
      <li>I doubt it&#x27;s good for everyday wear though.</li>
      <li>Had to trim the wig a lot, but overall pretty cute and realistic once stylized.</li>
      <li>it was way to long- more of a armin then a dave strider wig</li>
      <li>It does make my head a bit itchy but you&#x27;ll find that in pretty much every wig out there.</li>
      <li>but it was really noticeable at first.</li>
      <li>It is much longer than the picture, and not shaped at all.</li>
      <li>Thanks for reading~</li>
      <li>when I gave it my inspection, most of the hair in the back it spaced so far apart</li>
      <li>I kinda tuck my shades under the sides of the wig, by the way, because putting them under the wig keeps them on firmly.&lt;br /&gt;Since these downsides are nothing big and can be fixed rather easily</li>
      <li>Nice quality wig but too small for my head</li>
      <li>The color is most like the picture, and the wig needed little to no styling.</li>
      <li>Bangs are long but with a little bit of alterations it looks good.</li>
      <li>I got this to complete my Dave strider cosplay and I really like it</li>
      <li>I loved how the hair was so soft and easy to move, but my only problem was that it was just a bit too long (Kinda hard to see through &#x27;^-^).</li>
      <li>The wig is a little small but over all its really good! ^_^</li>
      <li>Along with the wig obviously looking fake and not looking like real hair, But if you are cosplaying Dave Strider, Rose Lalonde,  or Alois Trancy, this wig is fine</li>
      <li>your pinky can fit in between the little chunks.  </li>
      <li>The only complain I really have is that it&#x27;s a bit snug, but it stays in place snugly so.</li>
      <li>Spiking the wig is a whole different story.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This wig is way too small for my head, and there&#x27;s not nearly enough hair. I ordered this for a Brienne of Tarth costume, and will have to buy another wig, as this one is basically unusable.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> It is not worth the money.</li>
    <li> A little thin, and a little small. Very nice color, though. It does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> In my opinion it is one of the lower quality wigs I have. It is very thin but it still works. Not much you can do with styling due to it&#x27;s thinness. I have had this wig for a year I would say I am writing my review now because I wanted more experience with wigs before I wrote this. It is a comfortable wig though I do give it that.</li>
    <li> It came at a decent time,  the wig doesn&#x27;t look EXACTLY like the one in the picture,  but it&#x27;s still great! I got this for my Dave Strider cosplay and it&#x27;s perfect! It can also be used as a Rose wig, so that&#x27;s even better! It&#x27;s soft and shiny, yet super easy to put on and brush! It&#x27;s snug and comes with a wig cap, and the wig can be secured by two straps in the back! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> It fit the requirement of what I was looking for, but stunk like acid mixed with cow farts when I pulled it out of the bag. I had to use a LOT of wig shampoo and perfume to make the smell go away. I will not buying from you again until you fix this problem.</li>
    <li> The wig is very soft and it arrived within several days. It&#x27;s perfect for my Dave Strider cosplay!</li>
    <li> Ordered this wig for a Dave Strider cosplay, and it&#x27;s great for it. It arrived nicely packaged, and is very smooth and neat. The only complain I really have is that it&#x27;s a bit snug, but it stays in place snugly so.</li>
    <li> I loved how the hair was so soft and easy to move, but my only problem was that it was just a bit too long (Kinda hard to see through &#x27;^-^). It was great though for my Dave Strider cosplay, plus I can use it for many other cosplays as well. I was very happy with this product and hope others will be after buying this as well! Thanks for reading~</li>
    <li> After a while i have noticed it turns a little yellow. It has a good amount of hair but it still doesn&#x27;t hide the wig itself. Along with the wig obviously looking fake and not looking like real hair, But if you are cosplaying Dave Strider, Rose Lalonde,  or Alois Trancy, this wig is fine but i would recommend a lighter wig. This could possibly be used for Armin Arlert.</li>
    <li> Made for small SMAAAALL headed people.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for a Dave Strider (Homestuck) cosplay but it&#x27;s too short. It only works for Rose...i was very disappointed</li>
    <li> Had to trim the wig a lot, but overall pretty cute and realistic once stylized.</li>
    <li> For the price I was expecting something really awful but the wig came already styledwith a good amount of hair. This wig works great for a Sanji cosplay!</li>
    <li> This wig was good quality but it was too small for me or my friends&#x27; heads. We are all teenagers.</li>
    <li> I got this wig for a Dave Strider cosplay, and when it came, it&#x27;s a little small, and the back is short. I don&#x27;t mean short, I mean it&#x27;s so short that I can see and feel my wig cap falling out. I decided to cover it with a beanie which fixed that problem. The color is most like the picture, and the wig needed little to no styling. It is a little thin and very choppy layers in the back. Otherwise, it&#x27;s good. If I&#x27;d buy from this seller again, I think probably not. In summary, the back is too short with very choppy layers, the wig itself is a little small, and it&#x27;s thin. But the color is correct from the picture and the front works for my cosplay. So I rate it 3/5.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much shorter than I expected. I don&#x27;t think I have that big of a head, yet it barely covers my hair follicles. If I pull it down on the back, the bangs would be above the nose. I know some are supposed to be above the nose, but not as much like the pictures.</li>
    <li> Great first wig. I was worried it would be more of a cheap party wig but it&#x27;s perfect. Many people didn&#x27;t recongnizes me ecspecially while I was in cosplay as Dave Strider. If you are worried about shedding it does shed a little bit but that is to be expected from wigs sometimes. Wonderful product. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I got this to complete my Dave strider cosplay and I really like it the color is great and its thick and soft my only problem was that it was a bit long but that&#x27;s not a hard fix :)</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I love this wig alot. Its exactly what I was looking for. Its a good wig for dave strider. The shipping wasn&#x27;t to bad. They also have amazing customer service! They were extremely helpful! I am more then positive I will be making future purchases from them! :)</li>
    <li> I give it three stars because even though the shipping was fast (it actually got here weeks before it was supposed to), the item looks quite fake.. and looks nothing like what is in the picture.</li>
    <li> when my wig got here it came as all wigs do in a wig bag with a free wig cap but- when i opened it and put it on my wig head it was way to long- more of a armin then a dave strider wig and it was really thin- i attemted to cut it but that only made it worse- would not buy this again ;~;</li>
    <li> The wig is a little small but over all its really good! ^_^ I love it thank you! It actually came a little earlier than expected but I&#x27;m not complaining! XD THANK YOU!!! I love it! It&#x27;s perfect for my Finland (from Hetalia) cosplay!!</li>
    <li> Im sorry but I can not write a review of this product  cause i received a different wig instead i ordered</li>
    <li> First of all it came three weeks early which was great. Also I got this wig for my dave strider cosplay and it worked out great it was a bit short in the back but that was knelt because my hair was out up weird</li>
    <li> I bought this wig hoping I could use it for my Alois Trancy cosplay. Sadly, once the wig arrived, I put it on and regretted this purchase. The wig is very thin, and was very small. After realizing I couldn&#x27;t even use it for my Alois cosplay, I tried styling it for Dave Strider. Sadly, no matter how I tried to style it, the wig just wasn&#x27;t for me. It was a waste of money, since it&#x27;s a wig I can never wear.</li>
    <li> It is exactly as described and fits comfortably.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my sister for her Dave Strider cosplay (from Homestuck) and got it today, it&#x27;s soft and thicker in some spots than others, it&#x27;ll work though, the colour is perfect</li>
    <li> The wig comes quickly, and pretty great! My only issue is that it&#x27;s kinda rough feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s good for a Dave cosplay!</li>
    <li> Wayyy too short and not like the image as described. Will not order again</li>
    <li> she&#x27;s a drama queen never laying still though I thank you guys for sending a wig cap it make&#x27;s putting the wig on more easyer</li>
    <li> sadly im not really  satisfied with the product it looks not even close to the product that was being shone and when I comb it the some of the hair just shed out which made me even a bit disappointing which is making me not to want to buy it again not to mention  it being a little bit to shiny and the wrong kind of yellow</li>
    <li> This wig is very easy to style, and was a very good price, and is very good quality. Using this at Comic con this year :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my Dave strider cosplay.  I was semi-pleased. My only complaints are that the wig is too thin at the top and back.  Also the wig its self is short backed and tight for the average female head. The color is spot on-platinum blonde and it got here about the predicted time.  Bangs are long but with a little bit of alterations it looks good.</li>
    <li> This is a great  wig. Thank you! nicely packaged and good color. Will wear well and be useful for costumes of all kinds.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who has very long hair, and this covered her own hair well and the hair is very full looking.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter. And she loves it. I must say I was pretty impressed with the quality and that it actually looks good on her. She&#x27;s worn it many times.</li>
    <li> the wig was way too long. at least 4 inches longer than pictured.</li>
    <li> the back of it was hacked like someone just cut straight across</li>
    <li> Searched this up to see how many Dave&#x27;s bought this. Was not disappointed 😏</li>
    <li> It came earlier than I expected, and before Halloween too. I love how I can cosplay now, and it looks just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;All my friends love it as well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very well made wig and great feel.</li>
    <li> the material is weird</li>
    <li> Nice quality wig but too small for my head</li>
    <li> I found that I can use this wig for 3 cosplays, but the only problem is that the wig is a bit small for my head and needs some adjusting sometimes.</li>
    <li> I have a smaller than average adult sized head, and even for me this wig is far too small.  With a tight wig cap on and the weird inner straps adjusted to provide maximum stretch and security I couldn&#x27;t keep this thing off my head. Even when it was on - and I wasn&#x27;t moving so it didn&#x27;t pop off, it didn&#x27;t cover my hairline in the front or back.  When the lining is situated to cover the hairline the bangs in the front totally made it so I couldn&#x27;t see. I might have been able to trim it to suit, but it didn&#x27;t matter - it couldn&#x27;t stay on, so there was no reason to try and make it work. The color was great, and I liked the over all style and shape it was exactly what I wanted, but try as I might I couldn&#x27;t make it fit and I returned it.</li>
    <li> I got this a while back for my Dave Strider cosplay and it&#x27;s alright. Looks a bit different than what is shown before buying. I have posted a pic if you want to see me in the wig (Dave Cosplay!). Also I do want to point out the wig is rather small and very tight. I struggled putting it on because of that...maybe it&#x27;s just my head, even though I thought my head was small. Is it worth the buy? Maybe? I doubt it&#x27;s good for everyday wear though.</li>
    <li> THE BANGS ARE REALLY SHORT but great for Dave Strider cosplay</li>
    <li> When this product was still in the bag, I mentally cursed myself.  I saw glistening threads of a blonde, and a very bare back.  Sure enough, as soon as I opened it, it glistened, exactly like a wig from a party store.  I cosplay, which is the act of taking another character, and acting as they would.  I make my costumes, buy my wigs and usually buy my makeup.  I absolutely loved the idea of this wig, the picture is almost perfect for one of my characters, the style, the cut, everything.&lt;br /&gt;But when I gave it my inspection, most of the hair in the back it spaced so far apart your pinky can fit in between the little chunks.  The hair itself looks greasy and disgusting.  And it&#x27;s quite bare. when it&#x27;s on your head, the back of the wig shows whatever is underneath (wig cap or hair) and looks awful.  It glistens, it&#x27;s simply a child&#x27;s Halloween costume wig, if even deemed of that.  You can manage to make it look alright, if you put a beanie on, or keep a hood up, because the front of the hair I love.  It&#x27;s full, beautiful bangs.  But the deal-breaker is the obviosity of the plasticness.  I like my wigs to at least look 75% like real hair, this scores a 15%.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend that you NEVER buy this wig for cosplay, but if you&#x27;re a parents looking for a fun, one time use wig, this might be okay.</li>
    <li> It is ok, way too big for my head.. I wish they get smaller size... since not that expensive I do not want to send it so far away deal with back and fourth with china people!</li>
    <li> The wig came in quick and doesn&#x27;t seem to shed. It is thin though and at certain angles you can see the netting at the back. Its also a tad too shiny in some lighting but that can be fixed by adding a little baby powder to it.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t as i expected it to be. The bang are extremely short as is the back. The back is straight line cut and very choppy and thin. The wig in general is very thin which isn&#x27;t only a bad thing. Since its thin its also very light and breaths. The fibers are heavenly soft i can&#x27;t seem to keep from petting it. This wig would be okay for photoshoots and maybe cosplay but not for casual wear.</li>
    <li> This wig is perfect for any Dave Strider cosplayers. It holds well together and you can also style it very easily, depending on what you&#x27;re trying to go for. Spiking the wig is a whole different story. It doesn&#x27;t stay up well with hair spray but I haven&#x27;t attempted to use gel. Not sure how that would do on this wig but I&#x27;m fine with how it is. The only real problem I had with the wig is that the inner part where you can adjust the sizes were sewed. Luckily it already fits nicely on my head.</li>
    <li> A bit shorter than I had expected it to be, but it&#x27;s still amazing, I often use it for cosplay c:</li>
    <li> It came in on time, but it wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. It is much longer than the picture, and not shaped at all. There is no clear part to the wig, so it&#x27;s difficult to style. If you want a ROXY wig, this would be an excellent choice, but not for a DAVE wig.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Dave Strider (Homestuck) cosplay and it&#x27;s pretty great! It&#x27;s a fantastic color, it doesn&#x27;t look completely fake, it&#x27;s not too big or too small, and I didn&#x27;t have to mess with it too much to make it look right, which is a good thing because I don&#x27;t know how to style wigs at all. It&#x27;s also about as comfortable as a wig can get. It does make my head a bit itchy but you&#x27;ll find that in pretty much every wig out there. It&#x27;s tight enough to stay on but not tight enough to hurt. However, I don&#x27;t give it a full five stars because there are a couple slight flaws. Nothing major but I want to mention them anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;First off it&#x27;s kinda thin, especially in the front. I managed to cover most of it so it&#x27;s not a huge issue but it was really noticeable at first. Also it has a bit more volume to it than I expected, which is weird because of how thin it is. I had to flatten it out, but all it took was a few minutes of running my hands down it to make it better. It still has some volume, but if you&#x27;re cosplaying Dave like I am, the shades kinda reduce the effect. I kinda tuck my shades under the sides of the wig, by the way, because putting them under the wig keeps them on firmly.&lt;br /&gt;Since these downsides are nothing big and can be fixed rather easily, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. If you&#x27;re looking for a good Dave wig with a friendly price tag, you may have found your match with this one!&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I forgot to mention that the wig is a little bit long in the back, but the extra length can be tucked underneath the wig itself so it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
