      <li>It works on my forehead which is my biggest problem area for fine lines.</li>
      <li>great for daily use and helps with fine lines</li>
      <li>the best, as expected!!!</li>
      <li>but I discovered, well when my skin discovered Murad, I have noticed a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Murad.</li>
      <li>I can see a huge improvement since using this product.</li>
      <li>It feels smooth and light weight going on.</li>
      <li>That will not affect my evaluation of the product, but it could be important to customers looking to make a decision, so</li>
      <li>Great product, seems to lessen deep wrinkles over time.</li>
      <li>they are worth the money!</li>
      <li>I will not be ordering again unless a significant difference in the rest of the container.</li>
      <li>It goes smoothly almost like silk and penetrates quickly leaving no oily residue.</li>
      <li>This product really does smooth out the lines around my mouth and gives a lovely glow to my skin.  </li>
      <li>I received a sample size and liked it so much I ordered some right away.</li>
      <li>somewhere special.  </li>
      <li>product is true to its name</li>
      <li>Much smoother and more supple.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s wonderful &amp; within a few days I could see positive results.</li>
      <li>I like seeing quick results.</li>
      <li>Will smooth the skin out very gently and soften.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 36 and stay out of the sun, so the fine lines in my forehead are not terribly noticeable yet, generally speaking; this may take longer to have an effect on someone with sun damage).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 36 and stay out of the sun, so the fine lines in my forehead are not terribly noticeable yet, generally speaking; this may take longer to have an effect on someone with sun damage).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The person who used this has pretty much flawless skin but just getting older and their skin is maturing a bit so wanted to get a little something to help boost it for them.</li>
      <li>stuff is amazing - wish it came in a bigger container</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kinda like a quick fix for something that isn&#x27;t really fixable...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s non greasy, easy to apply, smells pleasant and is non irritating.</li>
      <li>dont know if it&#x27;s making me look any younger, but love Murad products.  </li>
      <li>First thing that goes on the face after my shower.  </li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says it will.</li>
      <li>damaged has some pretty pronounced wrinkles</li>
      <li>I use this product daily and am pleased with the results and on line price.</li>
      <li>Although I don&#x27;t use as consistently as I like, I do believe that when I do use it, there is a  suttle effect.</li>
      <li>I am now on my second bottle of this product and have enjoyed the results.</li>
      <li>First of all, I think the ingredients list on the product page is incomplete, as I&#x27;ve found a longer ingredients list somewhere else.  </li>
      <li>entirely sure which ingredient is responsible for the tingling, but in other products I&#x27;ve used that tingle a bit, the tingling is often associated with plumping (which would have the effect of minimizing fine lines and/or wrinkles).  </li>
      <li>It does just what it advertises, quickly absorbs and leaves my face soft.</li>
      <li>No dramatic results ....</li>
      <li>It penertrated fast.</li>
      <li>I am really liking this</li>
      <li>but I can really tell that something is working on my skin.</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t see any improvement, but I will keep using it.  </li>
      <li>I have very sentitive skin, and this has not bothrred it.</li>
      <li>This is no different than a cheap drugstore pump bottle cream.</li>
      <li>I really believe it makes a difference in how my skin looks and feels.</li>
      <li>So this product isn&#x27;t so much correcting the problem permanently as it is masking it for the day.  </li>
      <li>Most of the other Murad products I use are in Salon size.  </li>
      <li>This serum works very well particularly after a microdermabrasion procedure or chemical peel.</li>
      <li>More firm and filled out with regular use.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey to blow that kind of money for each small bottle.  </li>
      <li>A perfect everyday cream that after so many other more expensive brands, this one is terrific.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use this since I think my skin feels more supple and I have noticed a slight decrease in wrinkles.</li>
      <li>but i have used better products for less money.</li>
      <li>so she suggested using this stuff, particularly a couple hours before I go out for the evening or</li>
      <li>I would recommend this highly to anyone.  </li>
      <li>On the same day I bought the Murad I also bought Kiehl&#x27;s Powerful Wrinkle Reducing cream</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This serum works very well particularly after a microdermabrasion procedure or chemical peel. My skin is visably smoother and fine lines definitely decreased.</li>
    <li> I love murad.  Definitely worth the money</li>
    <li> Seems to be doing ok for me.  Having very old skin doesn&#x27;t help matters.  My granddaughter recommended it to me.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle.u</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wonderful &amp; within a few days I could see positive results.</li>
    <li> Second time purchasing, will not use anything else.</li>
    <li> Notice my skin is smoother and I see less wrinkles using this Product.</li>
    <li> I am now on my second bottle of this product and have enjoyed the results. I have read some reviews that said the user saw no change but I think I have, even if it is subtle. I will continue to use this since I think my skin feels more supple and I have noticed a slight decrease in wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Too expensive for what it does,  I have tried other products that are less expensive but still have made a difference.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It works on my forehead which is my biggest problem area for fine lines. I am 30 and started to develop fine lines on my forehead. I can see a huge improvement since using this product.</li>
    <li> This is my go to face cream. It is light, not oily and  I do believe great value for the price. Have ordered this from Amazon and received both bottles promptly and in perfect condition. A perfect everyday cream that after so many other more expensive brands, this one is terrific.</li>
    <li> Noticed some benefits- nothing fancy.  This product does not replace the importance of using moisturizer and the occasional exfoliant.  This product does not work best alone.</li>
    <li> It was good and appeared new&lt;br /&gt;Seems to work well&lt;br /&gt;Would buy from again&lt;br /&gt;The product is true to its name</li>
    <li> I really believe it makes a difference in how my skin looks and feels. It minimizes my wrinkles and makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
    <li> Yes. I notice when I don&#x27;t use this. It lifts just enough to make me feel a few years younger. And it holds most the day. Ideally I would apply it twice during the day, but life doesn&#x27;t allot for that. It&#x27;s non greasy, easy to apply, smells pleasant and is non irritating. I&#x27;ve learned to just keep this batboy in my daily/night regime for optimum results. Its works for me, and I shall not stray again!</li>
    <li> It feels smooth and light weight going on. It penertrated fast. I have very sentitive skin, and this has not bothrred it.</li>
    <li> Perhaps too soon to judge, but after 30 days no improvement at all!</li>
    <li> Great product, seems to lessen deep wrinkles over time.</li>
    <li> It works so well, it&#x27;s scary.  My mum just loves it, I noticed the almost immediate improvement when she started using it,  this is her 2nd bottle. Lines and wrinkles around her eyes and forehead have improved drastically you can visibly see the difference in as much as a few days.</li>
    <li> The cream is fantastic and makes my skin feel and look great.  I apply it to my neck and face every night after applying retin-a</li>
    <li> This product really does smooth out the lines around my mouth and gives a lovely glow to my skin.  Can&#x27;t go out without it!</li>
    <li> Meh. I returned this. I use a lot of Murad and Dermalogica products (among other brands) but this made no difference at all.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It does exactly what it says it will. I have used Channel exclusively for years and years until I had a Murad facial at Massage Envy. I am a believer in this product!</li>
    <li> Did not see any notable tightening of wrinkles</li>
    <li> One of my favorite Murad products and love these prices!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the results so far.  I would recommend this highly to anyone.  I will order this again soon.</li>
    <li> Although I don&#x27;t use as consistently as I like, I do believe that when I do use it, there is a  suttle effect.</li>
    <li> The product is ok.  I would recommend just a good moisturizer instead.  I feel product is overpriced.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> If you use the whold system of Murad products it is hard to tell which one are working but I can really tell that something is working on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love it! Have to be careful not to get on my lips. Causes swelling. Around my eyes it is amazing. Much smoother and more supple.</li>
    <li> I have really liked the results of this product. It is not drying OR greasy,and the lines around my eyes and mouth seem smoother.</li>
    <li> A good product and up to expectation</li>
    <li> This product works like magic I absolutely love it!!  I notice the lines on my face are hardly noticable now.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily and am pleased with the results and on line price.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Will smooth the skin out very gently and soften. I like seeing quick results. You won&amp;#34;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> should be packed better for the heat.collagen should be kept in cold temp.</li>
    <li> Not worth the cost.  I use it every day and don&#x27;t notice any difference at all.</li>
    <li> stuff is amazing - wish it came in a bigger container</li>
    <li> You only need a tiny amount, and it seems to be working!</li>
    <li> the best, as expected!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for six weeks now.  I use it twice a day, only on the deep wrinkles right under my brows and around my mouth (botox takes care of forehead wrinkles).  I really can&#x27;t see any improvement, but I will keep using it.  I probably should have taken before photos.  I am not expecting miracles, however if I cannot notice any improvement by the time I use it up, I will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This product has an estrogen component which I can&#x27;t use because of my breast cancer.  So i am unable to use the product.</li>
    <li> I used this product for eight weeks and saw absolutely no difference in the appearance of my skin. NO VISIBLE DIFFERENCE!! I feel ripped off once again. On the same day I bought the Murad I also bought Kiehl&#x27;s Powerful Wrinkle Reducing cream and I was happier with that product.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be effective in providing better skin tone.  More firm and filled out with regular use.  The only thing that would bring it up to 5 Stars is a salon size!  It&#x27;s a bit pricey to blow that kind of money for each small bottle.  Most of the other Murad products I use are in Salon size.  I recommend this product to anyone who needs a little firming up (not to be confused with a face lift!!) in their neck and face.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad bottle or what but I have not seen any improvements at all.</li>
    <li> My esthetician gave me a sample of this.  I&#x27;m pushing 50 with very fair skin.  The skin on my face is good but the skin on my neck and chest  is quite sun  damaged has some pretty pronounced wrinkles so she suggested using this stuff, particularly a couple hours before I go out for the evening or somewhere special.  I tried it and it works quite well; about an hour or so after I put it on my chest and neck appear much, much smoother both in terms of the very deep lines and the skin tone itself.  It&#x27;s kinda like a quick fix for something that isn&#x27;t really fixable...probably even surgery wouldn&#x27;t fix it.  I cannot say that the correction is permanent, by the next morning the effects are gone and I need to re-apply.  So this product isn&#x27;t so much correcting the problem permanently as it is masking it for the day.  I now use it every morning and reapply if I&#x27;m going out for the evening,  I think of it more as applying a cosmetic (whose effects I expect to wear off and I will need to reapply every day) rather than a semipermanent correction like I do with most of my skin care.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, it makes my skin feel wonderful and rejuvenated!</li>
    <li> Been using for over a month and have not seen the changes it promised. I will not be ordering again unless a significant difference in the rest of the container.</li>
    <li> dont know if it&#x27;s making me look any younger, but love Murad products.  they are worth the money!</li>
    <li> great for daily use and helps with fine lines</li>
    <li> I cannot be without my Rapid Collagen Serum.  First thing that goes on the face after my shower.  It does just what it advertises, quickly absorbs and leaves my face soft.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t praise this product enough - it&#x27;s just brilliant !!!</li>
    <li> First of all, I think the ingredients list on the product page is incomplete, as I&#x27;ve found a longer ingredients list somewhere else.  So I&#x27;ve pasted what I believe to be the entire ingredients list below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua), Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Olivate, Dimethicone/Bis-Isobutyl PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Sorbitan Olivate, Butylene Glycol, Honey, Urea, Yeast Amino Acids, Trehalose, Inositol, Taurine, Betaine, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Alaria Esculenta Extract, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5, Codium Tomentosum Extract, Hydrogenated Olive Oil, Olive Fruit Oil, Olive Oil Unsaponifiables, Sodium Hyaluronate, Collagen Amino Acids, Watermelon Fruit Extract, Apple Fruit Extract, Lentil Fruit Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium PCA, Sodium Lactate, Zinc Gluconate, Ascorbic Acid, Chitosan, Propyl Gallate, Polysorbate 20, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Aminomethyl Propanol, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Chlorphenesin, Linalool, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Lavender Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes: This contains some ingredients derived from animal sources.  Collagen amino acids can only come from animals, chitosan generally is produced as a byproduct of shellfish processing, and hyaluronate is often produced as a byproduct of poultry processing, although it can also come from modified bacteria (I don&#x27;t know which is the case here).  That will not affect my evaluation of the product, but it could be important to customers looking to make a decision, so I thought I&#x27;d include it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this at night for a couple of weeks now, after cleansing and toning and before a moisturizer.  I find that it&#x27;s easy to spread and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy or oily.  I do notice a bit of tingling a few seconds after I apply it.  I am not entirely sure which ingredient is responsible for the tingling, but in other products I&#x27;ve used that tingle a bit, the tingling is often associated with plumping (which would have the effect of minimizing fine lines and/or wrinkles).  It has not caused any allergic reactions (my skin is somewhat sensitive) and doesn&#x27;t seem to have increased breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for smoothing wrinkles or fine lines, I think this does a decent job but is probably not the best product I have ever used for that purpose.  I do feel that the fine lines in my forehead are minimized (note: I&#x27;m 36 and stay out of the sun, so the fine lines in my forehead are not terribly noticeable yet, generally speaking; this may take longer to have an effect on someone with sun damage).  3.5 stars.not entirely sure which ingredient is responsible for the tingling, but in other products I&#x27;ve used that tingle a bit, the tingling is often associated with plumping (which would have the effect of minimizing fine lines and/or wrinkles).

    <li> I have seen absolutely no results with this product.  I haven&#x27;t used any Murad products before, but always heard good reviews.  I do not recommend - it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I am really liking this it feels great &amp; I do see a difference.Its only been 3 weeks,so I can&#x27;t wait to see in 2 months what it does.I will keep you posted.  The bad part is too pricey @ MURAD,but AMAZON makes it happen.</li>
    <li> Also, just what she wanted, and not at the blown-up salon price.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. Light pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I have used this for three weeks.  I have noticed absolutely no difference in the appearance, or firmness, of my skin.  This is no different than a cheap drugstore pump bottle cream. I was expecting more from Murad.</li>
    <li> Only giving two stars based on the gift recipients reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The person who used this has pretty much flawless skin but just getting older and their skin is maturing a bit so wanted to get a little something to help boost it for them. Didn&#x27;t react well at all. Clogged pores resulted which never happens to this person. Can&#x27;t foresee it doing  any better for someone with problematic skin or more prone to clogged pores.</li>
    <li> I do love this product! I do see a difference since using it and use it twice a day! It&#x27;s not a wrinkle eraser (nothing is) but it does soften those deeper wrinkles for me.</li>
    <li> i used to use Estee Lauder products but I discovered, well when my skin discovered Murad, I have noticed a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Murad.</li>
    <li> i have been using  murad products since JOAN LUNDEN  introducet me to the product  havent stopped since love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey. I received a sample size and liked it so much I ordered some right away. It goes smoothly almost like silk and penetrates quickly leaving no oily residue. Living in Houston, I have to watch what I put on my skin or I could fry an egg from all of the oil by the end of the day. No dramatic results ....yet, but I think with any product you have to give it ample time to work.</li>
    <li> this product was satisfactory but i have used better products for less money.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I will buy again !</li>
