    <li> I am so disappointed with this purchase.  The perfume smells disgusting.  I want to return it badly.  Can&#x27;t stand the smell.  My rate should be 0 star.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this cologne after hearing several people talking about it. I went to the store and bought this fragrance for myself and I&#x27;d like to say, I am very happy with my purchase and the smell is fantastic! It sprays on evenly and has a very fresh, clean and distinctive smell. I must also say that the smell is extremely lasting. If I put some on in the morning, it is still noticable in the evening. The price is reasonable and there are several gift packages out there if you choose to be more economical. You just can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. I hope this helps. NEOSOUL.</li>
    <li> Great smell, not too strong, JUST RIGHT! good for any occasion, for young spirited personality, one of my favorite collections.</li>
    <li> I have used it a couple of times and think it has a nice smell. I have yet to receive any comments on it from women yet, but I get the feeling they like it.</li>
    <li> I recently tested this EDT when visiting a cousin that was using it. I immediately liked it and was surprised to hear what the price tag was. Definitely a winner! I usually stick with the YSL EDTs, but they are much more expensive. I&#x27;ll keep this one for a while, until I find my next cheap favorite! ;-)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son for Christmas and he loves it!! I couldn&#x27;t find it in any department store so I bought it based on customer reviews..I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
    <li> Daughter bought this as a gift and ended up giving it to my husband.  He and I really like it and now its all he wears.</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift for my significant other . Great price. Tghe smell is great i would shop more</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my fiance and every time he wears it, I would always ask what he&#x27;s wearing (he has a many cologne that he switches and selects daily) because it smells so good. To my surprise, each time I had ask him, it would turn out that he&#x27;s wearing the one that I had bought. It&#x27;s a very good aroma that&#x27;s not too powerful but is enough to get your attention. Soft and not too musky. Very refreshing! I highly recommend especially for the price, it&#x27;s a very good purchase!</li>
    <li> This is better than the signature.  Smell stays the whole day!    And people says it smells good lol</li>
    <li> I had the previous Beckham Signature cologne.  I really liked Beckham Signature and the Story is just as good if not a little better.  I think the best thing about it is it lasts a long time.  Not as in the bottle last longer, but the actual fragrance lasts throughout the day and longer.  I would definitely give it a try if you weighing between the original and story.</li>
    <li> Such a perfect scent for all seasons and ages! I have chemical sensitivities, and this fragrance allows me to hug my boyfriend without getting a headache. It&#x27;s not too strong, yet lasts all day. I don&#x27;t know why this product isn&#x27;t sold in retail stores anymore, but I can get it at a great price thru Amazon. I hope they continue making it.</li>
    <li> I received a cologne sampler of this cologne and loved it.  Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think this quite smells like what I  had in my sample but I may be wrong.</li>
    <li> Love this scent &amp; it was a good deal on price.  Easy transaction with timely delivery.  One of my favorites!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells great and the scent is a lasting one. Bought this for my friend for his birthday and he gets a lot of dates.</li>
    <li> The smell is okay and lasts a reasonable amount of time....not bad..just nothing special</li>
    <li> I risked to get this parfum, and now I love it.  I think that is better than others that maybe they cost much more.  This has everything, sensuality, elegance, and it last a considerably time.  When it is over, without any doubt I&#x27;&#x27; get it again.</li>
    <li> I use this cologne as my \\&quot;summer scent\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s light and refreshing and definately not overpowering even when you overspray it (as I have a tendency to do on occasion).  Only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t really last as long as other colognes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my husband and not only does he love it, its his favorite cologne he owns (which he owns quite a few.) Great purchase we will definitely be buying more.</li>
