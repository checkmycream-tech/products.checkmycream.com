      <li>, it&#x27;s great stuff.  </li>
      <li>I am so happy with this deodorant.  </li>
      <li>I have used Lafes Deodorant over a period of years and am quite happy with this product&#x27;s performance.</li>
      <li>This is better than having aluminum going into your body!!</li>
      <li>I love this!!</li>
      <li>Anyway, this is the best organic and safe option I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
      <li>I loved the formula when I could get it from WF.</li>
      <li>Avoid shaving armpits with a razor, as it can cause unwanted irritation.&lt;br /&gt;- Scrub your armpits good in the shower with good soap and a scrubber, I use an Axe Detailer Shower Tool.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>and we feel good using it.</li>
      <li>I went for it, and have been very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Just a word of advice, carefree organics deodorant is very good and worked very well for me.</li>
      <li>I used to use the regular Lafes Roll-on, and it gave me great protection throughout the day, this one did not disappoint me either!</li>
      <li>it is OK</li>
      <li>While this product does not stop a user from sweating it does neutralize the odor and most importantly does not seem to affect my asthma or allergy.</li>
      <li>Everyone&#x27;s different, but this works great for me.</li>
      <li>This natural deodorant is simply the best I&#x27;ve found anywhere, and I&#x27;ve tried my share of them.</li>
      <li>I have used many of the different scents and much prefer this one, as it seems to be the most effective of all of them.</li>
      <li>I find that regular exercise helps; get a good sweat going during exercise</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to everyone who wants to switch to a healthy and non-aluminum deodorant.</li>
      <li>Keeps me dry and smelling nice!</li>
      <li>My favorite natural deodorant!</li>
      <li>I do have to reapply occasionally but it&#x27;s kind of nice to not have to scrub in the shower to get the more typical antipersp residue off.</li>
      <li>It is mostly scentless as far as I can tell, but smells clean when you first apply it.</li>
      <li>It goes on wet, but dries fast and gives me great protection.</li>
      <li>Of all the natural deodorants I have tried, this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>When it is fresh it works fantastically.</li>
      <li>I started buying this deodorant when I lived near a Whole Foods and was able to purchase it from them.</li>
      <li>but I was willing to give it a try for a longer amount of time if it had not grown mold.</li>
      <li>My husband and I found this last year at a health food store and we love it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely more effective and last longer than a lot of the other naturals I have used (the crystal deodorants, Tom&#x27;s, Jason&#x27;s, etc...).</li>
      <li>I prefer this to the effective Crystal salts which drips &amp; needs to dry, the less effective Crystal roll on and the sage Weleda spray which however is a nice refresher addition on those hot or active days, perhaps get the travel size.</li>
      <li>Extraordinary scent control, very clean fragrance, and none of the propylene glycol found in other so-called &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; options.</li>
      <li>However, it has its own odd odor which, it seems to me, is inappropriate for a deodorant.  </li>
      <li>For real, everyone, this is the one.</li>
      <li>and I threw out the whole bottle.</li>
      <li>This works very well.</li>
      <li>This deodorant works very well</li>
      <li>It REALLY works</li>
      <li>Cap it very lightly and prepare for a mess.</li>
      <li>With the new stuff, there was mold on the roller!</li>
      <li>My husband used to love this product, but his last two bottles have been noticeably different.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t sweat heavily or smell much, so I can&#x27;t speak to how this works for the more fragrant folks out there.</li>
      <li>Also, i heard positive things about jungle mint  deodorant for sensitive, pore-clogged people but i haven&#x27;t tried it as yet.</li>
      <li>I have been searching for years (literally, years) for a natural deodorant that smells decent and really works to curb odor.  </li>
      <li>It really works and I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I tried this out as I was looking for a new deodorant, but found that it wasn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t go two hours before I started funking up the world with the new formula.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry quickly and if you rub some off you&#x27;ll lose the effectiveness.</li>
      <li>and now I use Schmidt&#x27;s Natural Deodorant http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D6OWWQC/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_9&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!</li>
      <li>I was disappointed in this product but my search for the perfect deodorant will thusly continue.</li>
      <li>All natural deo - I don&#x27;t smell perfumed</li>
      <li>I wanted to switch to a natural deodorant and I was using Jungleman for a while.</li>
      <li>Tea tree and sage are natural antibacterials, so those scents seem to work better.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly suggest this brand; I have tried several others and none of them come close to working as well as this brand.</li>
      <li>My last order, the liquid was thinner than normal and it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this deodorant a lot, but what turned me off was that it starting growing moldy in the bottle, so I had to get a new bottle.</li>
      <li>One of the only non-aluminum deodorants that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, however I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that effective at masking odors sadly...</li>
      <li>Half of the time this product is spoiled (it either looks yellow or smells funny from the get-go).  </li>
      <li>; A few tips for effective armpit hygiene:&lt;br /&gt;- Remove armpit hair using a clippers, it will eliminate unnecessary hair which traps sweat and stink - also, this way you can apply deodorant directly to the problem area.</li>

<li> It has never stained my clothing; several other natural deodorants I have tried left yellow marks that wouldn&#x27;t wash out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I know this sounds strange but,</li>
<li> only thing I would change is the smell, which took a little getting used to.  </li>
<li> I also had the problem like some other reviewers of the mold.</li>
<li> The other roll-on itches me and gives me under arm bumps this does not.</li>
<li> I should have listened to the other reviews about the mold.  </li>

<li> I finally got tired of the sticky feeling and ineffective ingredients</li>
<li> so basically it was a waste of money since I&#x27;m not going to use it again.  </li>
<li> I will continue to purchase this product, since it contains no aluminum or other nasty chemicals found in most mainstream deodorants.</li>
<li> Perhaps bc I am lazy and don&#x27;t bother to recap tightly at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and usually buy 10 at a time.  </li>
<li> I recommend that everyone try Lafes Roll-On at least once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys</li>
<li> I will say that the stick itself develops a strange smell after about a week, almost like very faint body odor.</li>
<li> After a couple uses the head of the bottle gets a horrible armpit smell, it is not coming from my armpit</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is better than having aluminum going into your body!!</li>
    <li> I bought this deo after a friend suggested it to me. It took awhile to get to me but the seller was up front about the shipment time. This deodorant works very well and I use it in conjunction with the crystal deodorant. I can go all day without smell or reapplication. I highly suggest this brand; I have tried several others and none of them come close to working as well as this brand.</li>
    <li> I started buying this deodorant when I lived near a Whole Foods and was able to purchase it from them. I loved the formula when I could get it from WF. However, I moved and needed some so I decided to buy it from Amazon. I couldn&#x27;t go two hours before I started funking up the world with the new formula. I also had the problem like some other reviewers of the mold. I never really noticed until I got to the end of the bottles with the old formula. With the new stuff, there was mold on the roller! I&#x27;d never had that happen before! Needless to say, I&#x27;ll never be buying this again until they decide to switch back to the old formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and now I use Schmidt&#x27;s Natural Deodorant http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D6OWWQC/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_9&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!</li>
    <li> It keeps down my body odor all day compare to other roll-on. The other roll-on itches me and gives me under arm bumps this does not.</li>
    <li> This natural deodorant is simply the best I&#x27;ve found anywhere, and I&#x27;ve tried my share of them. I used to add a solid fragrance deodorant to my crystal/mineral deodorants and it simply is not necessary with Lafe&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I first tried this. It really works and I have sensitive skin. So it took care of that problem. I love this!!</li>
    <li> While this product does not stop a user from sweating it does neutralize the odor and most importantly does not seem to affect my asthma or allergy.</li>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s different, but this works great for me. I do have to reapply occasionally but it&#x27;s kind of nice to not have to scrub in the shower to get the more typical antipersp residue off. I prefer this to the effective Crystal salts which drips &amp; needs to dry, the less effective Crystal roll on and the sage Weleda spray which however is a nice refresher addition on those hot or active days, perhaps get the travel size. Tea tree and sage are natural antibacterials, so those scents seem to work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had 5 bottles and have never seen the black mold thing as others have. Perhaps bc I am lazy and don&#x27;t bother to recap tightly at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issue I&#x27;ve had is in air travel where the pressure seems to force excess product thru the rollon into the cap, making a mess &amp; waste. Cap it very lightly and prepare for a mess. Might dust off the Crystal salts for travel, since the Lavanille travel I got at Sephora doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.</li>
    <li> I have used Lafes Deodorant over a period of years and am quite happy with this product&#x27;s performance. I have used many of the different scents and much prefer this one, as it seems to be the most effective of all of them. I will continue to purchase this product, since it contains no aluminum or other nasty chemicals found in most mainstream deodorants. Great product!</li>
    <li> I wanted to switch to a natural deodorant and I was using Jungleman for a while. I finally got tired of the sticky feeling and ineffective ingredients so I went on the hunt for something else. I ended up with Lafes Roll-On.. I went for it, and have been very satisfied. It goes on wet, but dries fast and gives me great protection. It is mostly scentless as far as I can tell, but smells clean when you first apply it. I&#x27;m a big guy and have had a hard time finding something that works. I recommend that everyone try Lafes Roll-On at least once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys; A few tips for effective armpit hygiene:&lt;br /&gt;- Remove armpit hair using a clippers, it will eliminate unnecessary hair which traps sweat and stink - also, this way you can apply deodorant directly to the problem area. Avoid shaving armpits with a razor, as it can cause unwanted irritation.&lt;br /&gt;- Scrub your armpits good in the shower with good soap and a scrubber, I use an Axe Detailer Shower Tool.&lt;br /&gt;- After my shower I disinfect further using a baby wipe to get rid of any residual bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;- Apply Lafes Roll-On Deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;- I find that regular exercise helps; get a good sweat going during exercise so your body doesn&#x27;t sweat when you don&#x27;t want it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Lafes and Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this deodorant a lot, but what turned me off was that it starting growing moldy in the bottle, so I had to get a new bottle. It&#x27;s definitely more effective and last longer than a lot of the other naturals I have used (the crystal deodorants, Tom&#x27;s, Jason&#x27;s, etc...).</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 5 years now.  It REALLY works and I can&#x27;t imagine changing brands.  Thank you Lafes&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I am a woman who sweats a lot and who has bad BO if my deodorant fails (which unfortunately most natural deodorants do...toms of Maine I&#x27;m talking about you). This one also did not do the job. It doesn&#x27;t dry quickly and if you rub some off you&#x27;ll lose the effectiveness. Also, you&#x27;ll need to reapply after about 3-4 hrs. I was disappointed in this product but my search for the perfect deodorant will thusly continue. Just a word of advice, carefree organics deodorant is very good and worked very well for me. Also, i heard positive things about jungle mint  deodorant for sensitive, pore-clogged people but i haven&#x27;t tried it as yet.</li>
    <li> Half of the time this product is spoiled (it either looks yellow or smells funny from the get-go).  When it is fresh it works fantastically.</li>
    <li> One of the only non-aluminum deodorants that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, however I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that effective at masking odors sadly...</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this deodorant.  I have been searching for years (literally, years) for a natural deodorant that smells decent and really works to curb odor.  I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year, and I hope they never discontinue it.  The price can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would change is the smell, which took a little getting used to.  I know this sounds strange but, to me, the scent reminds me of the smell of Juicy Fruit gum.  It has never stained my clothing; several other natural deodorants I have tried left yellow marks that wouldn&#x27;t wash out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recomend this product highly enough.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL. Would have odor within a couple of hours wearing.</li>
    <li> My favorite natural deodorant! Keeps me dry and smelling nice!</li>
    <li> After a couple uses the head of the bottle gets a horrible armpit smell, it is not coming from my armpit, I use it every time I sower and my armpits actually don&#x27;t smell, if you wash it the smell goes away for a couple days but then it comes back (even if you don&#x27;t use it) for the rest it is OK but the smell is a big downer</li>
    <li> My husband and I wanted to like this, but now on our second bottle we&#x27;re noticing some stinky shirt pits -- and it&#x27;s the middle of winter. It&#x27;s probably stress sweat, which is admittedly stinkier than hot-weather sweat, but we still won&#x27;t risk using this once the weather warms up.&lt;br /&gt;Also - FYI, we lost a lot of product when traveling with this bottle. If you don&#x27;t keep the bottle upright, product leaks into the cap and then spills out when you open it.</li>
    <li> Of all the natural deodorants I have tried, this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> All natural deo - I don&#x27;t smell perfumed and I don&#x27;t stink either, it&#x27;s great stuff.  My husband and I found this last year at a health food store and we love it, it works for both of us.  Great stuff and we feel good using it.</li>
    <li> I used to use the regular Lafes Roll-on, and it gave me great protection throughout the day, this one did not disappoint me either! I would recommend it to everyone who wants to switch to a healthy and non-aluminum deodorant.</li>
    <li> I tried this out as I was looking for a new deodorant, but found that it wasn&#x27;t for me.  Made with organic hemp oil and aloe vera, I thought that it would have been ideal.  However, it has its own odd odor which, it seems to me, is inappropriate for a deodorant.  Perhaps it is the smell of \\&quot;activity,\\&quot; but I wanted something that would combat odors, not generate them.  I use the unscented version instead.</li>
    <li> I think they&#x27;ve changed their recipe.  I&#x27;ve been using these for years and usually buy 10 at a time.  My last order, the liquid was thinner than normal and it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Within a couple days, the roller ball stank and I threw out the whole bottle.</li>
    <li> This works very well.</li>
    <li> My husband used to love this product, but his last two bottles have been noticeably different. And he&#x27;s noticeably stinky. I don&#x27;t know what happened but a product that used to work great just doesn&#x27;t anymore</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the other reviews about the mold.  After only a week the roller ball had mold so basically it was a waste of money since I&#x27;m not going to use it again.  It also didn&#x27;t work but I was willing to give it a try for a longer amount of time if it had not grown mold.</li>
    <li> For real, everyone, this is the one. Extraordinary scent control, very clean fragrance, and none of the propylene glycol found in other so-called &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; options. I don&#x27;t sweat heavily or smell much, so I can&#x27;t speak to how this works for the more fragrant folks out there. I will say that the stick itself develops a strange smell after about a week, almost like very faint body odor. It doesn&#x27;t transfer to your armpits in any way, but it&#x27;s noticeable. Anyway, this is the best organic and safe option I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
