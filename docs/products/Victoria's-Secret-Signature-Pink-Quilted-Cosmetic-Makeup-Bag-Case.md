    <li> Love it!Really cute and love the pink color!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my girls needs.</li>
    <li> Bought This For The Girlfriend Since She Just Throws All Her Make Up In Her Purse And It Gets Quite Messy. Nice Material And It Has A Nice Pink Color To It. Now All Her Make Up Fits Into This Bag Case. She Loves It And That&#x27;s All I Need.</li>
    <li> Made this into a little emergency kit bag for my purse!</li>
    <li> It is supper cute, and the color matches the picture!!! It&#x27;s perfect to put your makeup inside!!! Very happy to buy it!</li>
    <li> I love this bag. it is very cute and good quality. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and is still in good condition.</li>
    <li> This is a very sweet, ladylike cosmetic bag.  It is structured and holds its shape, just like in the picture.  It has a lovely pale pink pearlescent patent finish to it, with a little gold charm on the zipper pull.  The inside is pink and white stripe.  It is not too large and not too small, and would fit inside any but the smallest of purses.  Perhaps the only disadvantage would be if you wanted a cosmetic bag that opens very wide, like some that I have.  Because of the structured nature of the bag it doesn&#x27;t do that.  This bag would be appropriate for women of all ages, from very young to very mature, unlike some of the VS bags which seem to target a specific demographic or have slogans emblazoned on them.  I would recommend this, for yourself or as a gift.  I would love to see more products like this from Victoria&#x27;s Secret.</li>
    <li> I love the color the shipping was super fast. It is made out of very strong material and I feel like it will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> I love the pink case and I like how it doesn&#x27;t open &#x27;wide&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;b/c my makeup doesn&#x27;t spill all over the place</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loved it.</li>
    <li> Wife liked it. The zipper works wells and the color is nice in person.</li>
    <li> Love it! So nice to look at and stores all of my cosmetics very stylishly!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I found this little cosmetics bag because I needed one and I thought It would be a great size because I dont wear a lot of makeup by any means, and it is very cute. Needless to say, I was SO disappointed when within a DAY of having it and using it, one side of the bag lost some of its pink color. Its kind of hard to explain. I checked everything in my purse to see if it somehow scratched the bag or rubbed off on it or something and I cant figure it out :(. Its not so major to where it already looks worn out and I&#x27;d stop using it. But I am disappointed that It didnt stay nice, despite my efforts.</li>
    <li> Bigger than, I thought it was going to be. I love it, it&#x27;s perfect to carry my must have make-up supplies for the boat.</li>
    <li> Super cute!! It is the size of a regular makeup case for travel &amp; super durable!! A year later &amp; I still use it!! It&#x27;s exactly what you see in the picture. I am definitely ordering again once mine is ready for retirement!</li>
    <li> my fiance loved this make up bag, perfect size for her everyday purse. she said it was really well made and could fit her day to day needs real easily.</li>
