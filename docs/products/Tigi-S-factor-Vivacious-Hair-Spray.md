      <li>Received purchase fast and just as described ~ THANK YOU!!!! :)</li>
      <li>Tigi S-Factor Vivacious Hair Spray is the best that I have found in a long time.  </li>
      <li>Great for hold and not stiff at all.</li>
      <li>great hair spray, not stiff or unmanageable.  </li>
      <li>I was so surprised how great it smelled and</li>
      <li>Holds hair really well, plus smells good also.  </li>
      <li>so it is easy to work with, yet holds my flyaway super straight hair in the bouncy full style that I love!!</li>
      <li>I remembered I had that new hair spray and thought what a good opportunity to put it to use and test it.  </li>
      <li>Super hold and shine!  </li>
      <li>This hairspray holds all day without doing any of those things and it smells fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with the product and the price.  </li>
      <li>You can layer it so you can have a light or max hold.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s light, not sticky.  </li>
      <li>Provided a light hold but a bit sticky.</li>
      <li>I love this hair spray, use it every day and will continue to buy it from Amazon.com because the price is right.</li>
      <li>It has a nice smell, which is a big problem with most hairsprays.</li>
      <li>Just right!</li>
      <li>I really loved this hair spray, would definitely recommend it.</li>
      <li>they charge you full retail...  </li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>Product arrived quick.</li>
      <li>I went through this stuff so quick.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>, it comes right out.</li>
      <li>The seller shipped it quickly and the price is a real bargain.</li>
      <li>This hairspray comes out in a fine spray - better than any other spray I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>but this hairspray holds really well and smells great, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stiff or sticky.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m pretty neutral about this hairspray.  </li>
      <li>I love the hairspray, but when I received my order this last time, the can had leaked.</li>
      <li>I find I can even spray it first then put a bobby pin in.</li>
      <li>hot water and brush should do it.</li>
      <li>I would totally recommend this product for stay and play:)</li>
      <li>I love this hairspray so much, but if you shop it at local stores and salons...  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got a small can of this hair spray when I participated in a fund raising event.  I threw it in my bag of goodies and forgot all about it until one day it was raining and I needed to spray my hair to protect it from falling in the rain.  I remembered I had that new hair spray and thought what a good opportunity to put it to use and test it.  I was so surprised how great it smelled and how well it held up in the rain.  My hair didn&#x27;t lose its style, still had movement and the best part: my hair didn&#x27;t get that hard and crunchy feel a lot of hair sprays give you.  I had to buy more and every where I looked the price was way too high so I did an online search and found it on Amazon.com.  I love this hair spray, use it every day and will continue to buy it from Amazon.com because the price is right.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quick. Good product, Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Hairspray for three years now. I absolutly love it. I smells great, has fantastic hold and shine. I do alot of updo&#x27;s and vintage hair and this stuff is perfect for stying. You can layer it so you can have a light or max hold. I find I can even spray it first then put a bobby pin in. This is by far the best hairspray I have ever used. Well worth the money. It brushes out great too.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Speedy delivery as well. I would recommend it to any and everyone.</li>
    <li> Totally love this spray!! Great for hold and not stiff at all. You are able to still have movement.. I would totally recommend this product for stay and play:)</li>
    <li> My hairdresser turned me onto this.  It holds without being too sticky allowing me to now go 3-4 days between washing my hair.  Finally!  It is hard to find locally and when I do, very pricey.  I am so glad to be able to order it on-line.  I do several at a time and re-order when I start my last can.</li>
    <li> This hairspray comes out in a fine spray - better than any other spray I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s light, so you can spray it all over to tame the flyaways without it looking like a helmet.  It smells great, too, though it is not the cotton-candy smell of the lusterizer or shiny happy people spray from this line.  I am really happy with this hairspray.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this brand at a salon for double the price.  I love this and love the price that Amazon offered.</li>
    <li> This hairspray has a very strong hold and doesn&#x27;t look clumped in your hair. It sprays on very well, but the scent turns me off from it. I have only used this twice now because I end up smelling like the fruity hairspray all day instead of my perfume. I would recommend this product if you are looking for a good hairspray with a very nice scent (just be warned that it is a STRONG smell).</li>
    <li> o.k......on the plus side it smells great and is really strong.  The negatives it is sticky and gave my \\&quot;helmet hair\\&quot;.  I much prefer Elnett which holds great and isn&#x27;t sticky.  So I&#x27;m pretty neutral about this hairspray.  I will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I went through this stuff so quick. I never use hair spray because I do not like the crunchy hard feeling it give hair. This stuff works and if you use the right amount it is perfect. A little goes a long way. I realized if I use a lot it does make my hair crunchy so its nice that it works with just a small amount. The smell of course, was phenomenal....all of the S factor line smells like heaven! I really loved this hair spray, would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  Not a stiff hold and allow for your hair to move.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray!</li>
    <li> Best hair spray i have ever used.  It&#x27;s the perfect hold and not stiff.  The next best thing about this hair spray is that it smells so good.  I have had so many complements from people wanting to know what kind of perfume i&#x27;m wearing.  And it&#x27;s noticable only when someone is close to you so as not to be over powering.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a few years now after my daughter got it in a gift bag at an event she had gone to.  I just love it.  It doesn&#x27;t get stiff or sticky, but still holds my hair, which is very thin and fine.</li>
    <li> Best hairspray I&#x27;ve had. Hold, shine, softness, frizz control....love it. The smell gets me lots of compliments, too! The packaging did seem a little wasteful though.</li>
    <li> I love this spray.  It doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell like some do and it&#x27;s light, not sticky.  I ONLY use this spray for my hair.  I&#x27;ve tried others but nothing compares.</li>
    <li> I am a hairdresser,, and I personally recommend this product,, not sticky, smells &amp;#34; GREAT&amp;#34;, overall,, is meant for a sturdy hold in the hair without the stiffness,,, the aroma brings on many compliments</li>
    <li> This hairspray is light but holds perfectly and does not have a strong scent, which works for me since I&#x27;m allergic to so many perfumed products.  I&#x27;ve paid over $25. per can in the salons both in the U.S. and in Europe.  I&#x27;ve never found it on a regular retail shelf.  The seller shipped it quickly and the price is a real bargain.</li>
    <li> This was my first time purchasing this hair spray and it is quite wonderful.  Super hold and shine!  I have ordered more for backups.</li>
    <li> As expected and arrived timely.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and was worried about the expiration date based on other reviews.  I found out from the manufacturer that the date on the bottom of the can (12/20/14 in this case) is the batch date on which it was created and that the average shelf life is 3 years.  Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with the product and the price.  I&#x27;ve used this for a while and I love how light it feels while still being effective.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a long time and was amazed that the price on line is so much cheaper than buying it at local store.</li>
    <li> good firm hold hair spray... yet doesn&#x27;t leave it aqua net crispy.. dont get me wrong... it leaves it kinda crispy... but more matte... if that make sense</li>
    <li> very nice light fruity smell, hair spray strength is mild. i tried the shampoo and cond. but my hair didnt like it. you need clean the tiny hole ..hot water and brush should do it. i like it.</li>
    <li> I buy this hairspray all the time. I always get compliments on how nice my hair smells. It works great for me because I need a strong hold and I need the volume it provides. I have been using for about 4 years now. I also like the fact that you don&#x27;t get a heavy build up so when I wash my hair, it comes right out.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It keeps the curl in my hair all day without feeling stiff</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to write a review on this after my frustrating experience. I loved the hairspray I bought at the salon, but this freezes up and won&#x27;t come out of the can. Yes, I kept track which cans came from where. The spray nozzle in the picture (I can see it through the cap) is the kind that came with my salon spray, but NOT the one that came with this order. This won&#x27;t save you money if you can&#x27;t get it out of the can!</li>
    <li> Love this spray.  Not sticky and great smelling.  My hairdresser used this on me and I had to order some afterwards.  I&#x27;m not into hairspray however this one holds nicely without the next day need to wash hair issue I had with other hairsprays.</li>
    <li> Great product. Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Tigi S-Factor Vivacious Hair Spray is the best that I have found in a long time.  My hair is very fine, rather thin, and somewhat fragile.  I have a hard time find a hairspray that holds without weighing my hair down, making it feel sticky or stiff.  This hairspray holds all day without doing any of those things and it smells fantastic.  I will continue to use this product for as long as I can get it.</li>
    <li> It holds your hair in place, but you can pay a lot less for the same thing.</li>
    <li> This hairspray goes on very light so it is easy to work with, yet holds my flyaway super straight hair in the bouncy full style that I love!!</li>
    <li> This hairspray is amazing....  not only does it hold really well...  it has a very nice smell to it... almost fruity...  I love this hairspray so much, but if you shop it at local stores and salons...  they charge you full retail...  and that can be as much as $25..  so to purchase it for $12 if they had more would have gotten more...  great spray</li>
    <li> too sticky for my taste. The smell is great however. The hold is just a tad to much for my taste</li>
    <li> the pump dose not spray that well you have to force it down.. but i love the spray and the smell.</li>
    <li> Best hairspray ever. Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or look like you have hairspray on your hair, yet holds. Smells great.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this hairspray!  It has a nice smell, which is a big problem with most hairsprays. I use to use this other brand that worked just as well but my husband especially couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.  When one of my friends commented on the nasty smell, I started my search for a new brand and found Tigi!  It holds your hair in the most humid conditions but yet if you touch your hair it still feels soft. It really is the best!</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray.  I have very fine hair and it works extremely well to keep my hair in place.  It is also less expensive than other hair sprays I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray.  Holds hair really well, plus smells good also.  I have been using for a long time now and so glad that Amazon.com carries it.  Works on all types of hair.  Good product to buy.</li>
    <li> Lov this stuff!  A bit pricey so I only use it when going out out...Will def buy this item again!</li>
    <li> I love anything Tigi...but this hairspray holds really well and smells great, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stiff or sticky.</li>
    <li> Received purchase fast and just as described ~ THANK YOU!!!! :)</li>
    <li> great hair spray, not stiff or unmanageable.  Holds all day,Just right!</li>
    <li> I love the hairspray, but when I received my order this last time, the can had leaked.</li>
    <li> This hair spray is light enough that you can gently comb through it.</li>
    <li> This hairspray smells soooo good!!! It&#x27;s leaves your hair manageable but with hold. I love the S-Factor line!! My favorite hairspray!</li>
    <li> Will continue ordering from Perfume World Wide Inc!</li>
    <li> Provided a light hold but a bit sticky.</li>
