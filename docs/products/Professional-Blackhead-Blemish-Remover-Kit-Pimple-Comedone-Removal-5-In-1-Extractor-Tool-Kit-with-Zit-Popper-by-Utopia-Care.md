<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the tool kit comes in a tidy zip up case that is really nice and portable a little over the size of my hand. Once unpackaging them, I quickly washed them (not that they were dirty, I just always wash anything that&#x27;s going to touch my face because my skin is sensitive) and started testing them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about to wrap up my first trimester of my pregnancy and my skin has been AWFUL. I&#x27;m not one to pick but dear lord has it been bad. This tool kit easily removed the inflamed zits. The next day they looks almost healed (this is why you DON&#x27;T want to use your fingers, it can cause huge scabs that last a couple of weeks). My husband also has been using them and told me to give them a 5 star review, he loves them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of useful youtube videos on how to use these tools, or similar. So if they look a bit overwhelming definitely check them out!&lt;br /&gt;Please note, I received this item at a reduced price for my HONEST review.</li>
    <li> Good quality, works great, love the case.</li>
    <li> Great product! I mostly only use the main blackhead remover tool, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find uses for the other ones in due time.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with these tools.  I couldn&#x27;t get them to work without causing damage to the surrounding skin but it doesn&#x27;t remove the blemish.</li>
    <li> The kit does not come with instructions. I had to Youtube some techniques. Not as easy to use as it looks.</li>
    <li> Good starter kit. I haven&#x27;t used them on the skin yet, but the quality is decent. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> love it. good quality</li>
    <li> Excellent product of high quality ....</li>
    <li> Great quality. Arrived super quick. Love it</li>
    <li> works pretty well.  I like it.. I use it once a month</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the quality of these.  I&#x27;m also pleased they come in a nice case which keeps them much more sterile when not in use than just throwing them in the bathroom drawer.  I&#x27;ve purchased other products from this company and they seem to sell all high quality merchandise.</li>
    <li> These are not bad, however the one issue i have with them is that three of the sides generally seem to be exactly the same. They work great though, and are sturdy and easy to clean! So, I find  myself constantly using them! I can&#x27;t get over how well they work! Just flatten the skin on your nose, press down with the blemish remover and, voila your blackheads have been extracted!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample Provided</li>
    <li> great selection of tools.  I was able to get rid of some black heads that no other blemish remover was able to do in the past.</li>
    <li> Lousy metal, low grade, mostly useless</li>
    <li> Do Not buy these tools!This product is dull and not like the tools they show on the site.Don&#x27;t work,just threw them away.</li>
    <li> Great kit for the money. Came in a black zip case and all of the tools are decent quality.</li>
    <li> Small, compact, and very effective.</li>
    <li> A must have for anyone with a teen in their home. Product is sturdy and well made.  Not weak and bendable.  Multiple tips available in order to use most effective style. Love the case, which is sturdy too.  Best group of tools I have owned. Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> It is a good product and I am not disappointed with the quality. The only thing that would have been useful is an introduction/instruction guide on how to use the tools. Utube has been helpful though.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set for my husband. He absolutely loves it! Between all the different types of extractor heads, he&#x27;s been able to remove just about every blackhead. The tools are very high quality, easy to sterilize, and they don&#x27;t bend like other tools he&#x27;s tried.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted this to clear up some blackheads and other skin issues , she says that these tools are the perfect remedy for said problems</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected. Fast shipping. Fully Satisfied with purchase.</li>
    <li> Great tool kit. With a family of two teens we find very useful. Built of steel all the items in the kit are sturdy. Every family needs one!</li>
    <li> Still trying to figure out what each tool is for, but so far i am loving it. My poor pores... they need minimizing!  :*)</li>
    <li> Received as advertized  no problems</li>
    <li> Only really needs one of them. Should have bought a smaller pkg.</li>
    <li> These are great tools you can really tell, even by touch, they are great quality! The are bigger than I expected but no problem there! I DEFINITELY recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Received the product with in a few days of my order.  The case that the tools comes in is very convenient.  The tools them self are pretty easy to use.  They are sturdy  and get the job done.</li>
    <li> l love this product it keeps you from creating those ugly scars that come from pinching,</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know too much about the process , but I have been successful using these tools.  I have my favorites and ones that have never been useful, but I am happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product! Came just as described. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. It&#x27;s a great, pain-free way to remove any sort of blemishes. The stainless steel is remarkably sterile and cleaning the tools is very simple. The variety of tools allows for a selection depending upon your needs. Upon ordering I received this within a few days and I really like the handy little carrying case the tools came in, will definitely recommend this product/seller to anyone.</li>
    <li> I found this product useful and exactly what I expected after reading the reviews. After reading some reviews that their tools were not quality made, I was worried that mind might not be what I was hoping but I love them! I only use about 3 of the 5 tools because they get the job done. Make sure you use steam on your face to open pores when using these or you will not get results!!! Very happy with the price and quality.</li>
    <li> We have been popping for a while. Now we are on the next level. With these tools we&#x27;ve upgrade to a dermal surgeons excavating pores faster than a motorcycle</li>
    <li> This is a keeper. However I have some problems working it on my own so I have one of those magnifying mirrors that I use to ensure I can see what is within my pores. The item is a wonderful cosmetic addition!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love it and don&#x27;t hate it. My blackheads are very hard and difficult to remove even after professional advice. Works fine on my husband,</li>
    <li> Really nice kit in a nice case.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t mastered these yet but the little I have used them, they&#x27;re great for not leaving nail marks in the skin.</li>
    <li> Really good quality for the price. Pushing ring is well polished, no shape edges. Nice build.&lt;br /&gt;I glad I make a good choice.</li>
    <li> I like the case and the tools look cool, I wish it came with one sharper object for popping pimples.</li>
    <li> I was happy with how this packaged in the mail shipment as it came just as stated. It gets the job done for sure.</li>
    <li> It help to have the set for all size&#x27;s what a defiant.</li>
    <li> Finish isn&#x27;t quite as pictured, more of a dull leaden coloration but otherwise it is as pictured. Tools work perfectly as does the case although the bands holding the tools are difficult to work with and already I am tearing up the case interior a bit trying to wrangle them into secure positions. The problems are very minor - no big deal and all in all I am happy with the tool set!</li>
    <li> Very nice carrying case with a variety of high quality tools very any application. Honestly, there are so many tools here I dont even know where to start but everything is here!</li>
    <li> Works very well. Nice, quality tools. I would recommend. ...I&#x27;d also recommend buying a steamer as well. It&#x27;s better to use a steamer on your face before using these in order to bring blackheads or whatever to the surface.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and weight, and also very good material.</li>
    <li> I order this kit and was really excited!! I was tired of messing up my face trying to get rid of blackheads and blemishes with my long gel nails! This has made the job super fast and super easy! Will never go back to using my hands with this great kit in my arsenal!! Arrived fast! Not over packaged and in great shape! My only problem now is always wanting to use it to clear my husbands blackheads and blemishes with it too!!</li>
    <li> The best kit you can find on Amazon. It is helpful for all problems that you can have! (Even milia)</li>
    <li> Not top of the line extractors, but great for what you&#x27;re paying. The circle looped one is my new favorite, though I&#x27;m still learning how to use the other ones.</li>
    <li> Great set. Very sturdy, strong and well made. Does exactly what I need it to do!</li>
    <li> The Material used for the product is excellent and is very useful as well.</li>
    <li> Fast shipper well packed item as expected.Looks good!</li>
    <li> They rusted the first time I cleaned them</li>
    <li> Good quality skin care set. Nice case. Have wanted a set for a long time, for my Son who is just starting to get breakouts. Professional made and durable.</li>
    <li> I got this set just to have a variety of tools for removal of tiny plugged pores (they have a little white head, eww).  I thought they were made of stainless steel, but the metal appears dull and cheap.  They seem sturdy enough and there is a nice variety of sizes for different uses.  I was interested in the lance as well as the small cup like end.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the tools fault, but so far I&#x27;ve had no luck getting rid of or even getting anything out of my plugged pores.  I&#x27;ve also been afraid to use the lance as I don&#x27;t want to scar.  Guess I really don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing (despite watching several you tube versions), or else these plugs are too solid in nature to come out with the tools. I do admit that I haven&#x27;t tried steaming my face first, so I&#x27;ll just have to try again after doing that.  Overall the set is good enough and I think the price is right for so many different tips. It is nice to have a case to keep them all together in one place.</li>
    <li> Sturdy tools, not too big, not too small.  The pointed one is not sharp enough then again a dermatologist should be doing any kind of deep punctures.  Easy to travel with.  Not sure what to use the big loop tools for.  I tend to use 2 or 3 ends of the whole set, but for the price and small packaging it&#x27;s worth it for me.</li>
    <li> This set is awesome for the price, a few of the tools need to be shaped a little differently, some more flat and others more rounded. But like I said it doesn&#x27;t get any better for the cost!</li>
    <li> Very low quality set of tools, a couple of the extractors still had very rough edges.The only useful thing about this product is the case they came in. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> It arrived in a timely manner. It is well worth the price. I like the way it helps remove the blackheads from my teenage grandson.</li>
    <li> This set has every tool that you would need to keep your face blackhead and blemish free.  The tools come in a carrying case so that you can just throw them in your suitcase or overnight bag.  I will be honest I&#x27;m a little perplexed on the best way to use a couple of the tools so I am going to look up some videos on youtube so that I can get the most out of this set.  They don&#x27;t appear to be surgical quality but they seem nice and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item at a promotional rate for review purposes.  My reviews are always unbiased and honest.</li>
    <li> Worked great for my 12 year old son... Had to watch a few YouTube videos to get the hang of it (which was kinda nasty) but very satisfied w/ results!!!</li>
    <li> I think this is a useful set of tools and they look fairly durable though I have not yet put them to use. Very nice to have the storage case to keep them together too.</li>
    <li> Works like a champ. I have a 13 year old boy so it is a useful item!</li>
    <li> This is a great set of tools for cleaning out your facial pores. And they don&#x27;t mark up your face and leave scars. The price was fantastic. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This set is very thoughtfully created. It has a tool for just about everything you could need to keep your skin clean, clear and in tip top shape. I received a discount on this product for the opportunity to review it but I can say that I will be ordering a few more just to have for back up. The metal is not flimsy and the little carrying case is very nice. This product is an A+ in my opinion and for the price you can not beat what you get included. I have been looking for the tool in the middle of the picture for years and just now found it. I am so glad that I ordered it am I am sure that you will be too.</li>
    <li> If you know how to use it, it is an indispensable tool</li>
    <li> Nice kit, works great!</li>
    <li> Tools are sturdy and well made, product does exactly as it is designed to do!</li>
    <li> Good products. It works for my chin black heads. I feel like it may work better with  bigger black heads.</li>
    <li> The quality is great and the case keeps them all together and clean. I would have liked an explanation on their functions but that is more my ignorance than it is a fault of the items!</li>
    <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s but still get a blemish every once and a while so got this kit.  It helps get the gunk out and clear up the blemish faster without picking apart your face.  When your skin is steamed or warm from working out, it really gets lots of junk out of the pores for a healthier looking face.  Easy to use and different sizes make the kit worthwhile!</li>
    <li> Good one.  As explained. So happy to have it as promised.</li>
    <li> I was happy when this arrived. The tools are good quality and the case that it comes in is perfect for storage. I have a bad history of picking at my skin. I wish I had this a long time ago when I was younger and had more acne. I think using these tools would have prevented some of the scarring. I have used the tools on my nose and chin and they work! Also, they seem easy to disinfect.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product and quick shipping!</li>
    <li> Since this got to my house, my husband and I both have been going to town on the pores on our noses. It can be a little painful, but I have to say, we both have brand new faces. Our pores are clean and tiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is decent, but the little rubber bands that hold the tools in place are a pain. Getting the tools back in place can be a hassle. At least I don&#x27;t have to worry about them slipping out of place. Also, we only seem to use two of the tools. I guess there is a use for the others, but I haven&#x27;t figured it out yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure to sterilize the tools and your face before and after (and maybe even during) use. We use rubbing alcohol on the tools, and salicylic acid on our faces, followed by moisturizer.</li>
    <li> The carrying case is cheaply made and a couple extractors aren&#x27;t very useful.</li>
    <li> my husband works at night in the heat so he gets lots of bumps on his back. I love popping bumps and will attack his back on a daily basis. he always complains that I hurt his back. I used this item this morning and it made it so much easier and less painful. will be using these from now own.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother in law who is infatuated with popping bumps and blackheads and such. She LOVES these tools. All items included are built very good, steel. Cute little black zip up case comes with it so she can carry it in her purse. Her husband said that they work and feel much better on his back then fingernails, so they must do the job well!</li>
    <li> It works pretty well and the zipper pouch is nice</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 16 year old. She kept picking at her face with her fingers and turning a small blackhead into this huge red bruised area where everyone asked what happened to her face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She likes the case it came in and also says it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Very nice!  I know some of you can relate when I say you get a blemish that you just cannot get to pop no matter what.  It&#x27;s in an awkward area that you can&#x27;t get your fingers in the right position to squeeze.  It&#x27;s just not budging when you squeeze with all your might.  No more!!  This does the trick.  There are multiple tools to do the trick.  You cannot go wrong.  Everyone should have one of these sets on hand.  I was given a great discount to try this kit out and I&#x27;m so glad.  It&#x27;s amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I will recommend to my friends, shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Good blackhead remover without leaving a scar. I didnt give a 5 since I think it can be improved. I would prefer if it is thinner.</li>
    <li> The littlest tool works well on little black heads on nose. That&#x27;s all I need this tool for! Would recommend for that.</li>
    <li> Really good product for the price.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how the cylindrical extractors have a hard time sliding into their elastic band properly.  The edge gets caught on it.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> This product does not rust like some other ones and a couple of the applicators works really well in extracting the blackheads on my nose and chins.</li>
    <li> Good quality and elegant set to keep in your cabinet. Pretty intuitive even though I would appreciate some link of instructions or tips. would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This kit was exactly what we needed for blackheads and other skin problems. Nicely packaged to keep them all together and clean.</li>
    <li> It helps get those blackheads out. Use it after a hot shower or steaming your face. Will take a bunch of different sessions to get all the gunk out of your pores. It doesnt hurt as much as pinching pores and doesnt peel skin as much when your doing work on your face.</li>
    <li> This tool pack is an awesome deal. There are so many different shapes. The ends are nice and rounded so you don&#x27;t tear skin. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the metal doesn&#x27;t slide as easy over the skin as shiny chromo-plated tools. However, this prevents slipping too.</li>
    <li> good product - great price.  you just have to work with each piece to see what will work best for your blackheads/blemishes.  share them with my teenage daughter (disinfect after each use), and she found them to be quite effective as well.</li>
    <li> The set is very high quality, you get many instruments and the case for the price of one instrument. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I have owned other instruments which were of higher quality.  The stainless is not shiny and doesn&#x27;t feel like it is made if high end stainless steel.  I will be replacing it by going to a store where I may look and feel product before I purchase.</li>
    <li> great tools for the price!</li>
    <li> Excellent products!!!!!!!This helps my teenage son a lot!</li>
    <li> The product seems ok, but it would have been helpful to receive instructions as well.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and great pruduct!</li>
    <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve used it with great success!</li>
    <li> Great quality at a great price!</li>
    <li> works good. some of them i dont really use or need you maybe need like 2 of them out of the 5. maybe buy a cheaper one that comes with the ones you need</li>

    <li> Good quality I love it</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m not particularly great at operating the tools yet, there are a wide variety included in the kit and they work well for what they are intended for.  Hopefully practice helps out.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to review it. Comes in a cute little case. It worked for a blemish but not so far for black heads. Still at this price it&#x27;s good for what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> Unfortuneitly, my husband has terrible acne on his back, This works wonderful without all the pain and contamination.  So much that I have purchased this for family and very close friends when making holiday baskets or as a stocking stuffer.  You cannot beat the price</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son for Christmas because he is always stealing my little black head remover tool. This set is really great! iI has such an assortment of tools and they are varying thicknesses so you can get the smallest or largest with perfect fit. I tried it on a small blackhead I had on my chin and it came out with such ease and no gouge or blood. Great product and fast shipping. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This tool was recommended to me by my sister but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would.  My daughter and I both tried it but gave up.  I figured if it was much better than using your own fingers, then my esthetician would be using it.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a blemish removing tool look no further,  this kit comes with every type of blemish remover you will need!</li>
    <li> Works just as expected. They are easy to use, and the case keeps everything in order. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> It would be helpful to have a better idea of how to use all the tools. Does not come with instructions. Those might be gross anyhow. The tools that I can figure out do work and are made out of a good metal that should last quite a while.</li>
    <li> Just as described. I been searching for a set like this for awhile. Love love the bag it came in.</li>
    <li> This did not come with instructions, which made it very difficult for me to use the tools efficiently. However, The tools are sturdy and offer a variety to deal with various &amp;#34;problems&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> My son has deep blackheads and this didn&#x27;t help extract them at all.  It works good for whiteheads with minimal pain.</li>
    <li> Occasionally have a few stubborn blackheads.  The tool worked well !</li>
    <li> The product is great, the package contain different kinds of blackhead removers.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping, great quantity and reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend it for removing black heads.</li>
    <li> It works like it should.</li>
    <li> I have seen these tools but never used them before.  As it turns out, they work pretty well and leave fewer and less traumatic marks on the skin to relieve blemishes.  They are good quality utensils but I wish they came with some expert instructions, as well.</li>
    <li> Certainly not the most glamourous thing to talk about, but this handy kit is highly effective is getting the job done. Perfect selection of tools to properly care for your skin from head to toe and all perfectly stored in a neat zipper case. I use this kit nearly everyday. Easy to use and maintain.</li>
    <li> It is just what I asked for.  It worked the first time I used it, If I needed another I would get it.  THANKS</li>
    <li> I have not used the product because there were no instructions on how to use the extractors.  There are a variety of instruments, but it is not clear what the purpose is for each one.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I&#x27;ve had blackheads on my nose for years and after 1 use the majority of them are gone.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Only one of the heads is actually useful, the L shaped one. All the other heads don&#x27;t apply pressure correctly and could potentially damage skin so I don&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> These work alright. I thought they would be a little less flimsy. They bend easily.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I saw all those YouTube videos where they extract zits and blackheads with these and my mom had one of these tools that she swore by. I also saw all the other reviews where people said that it took some learning how to use before they loved it. I am sure when I figure out how to use it correctly, I will be more thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;Also, know that you will probably not extract from your face the amount of gunk than they do on those extreme cases on YouTube so it is a lot less exciting.&lt;br /&gt;But great product. Quality, fast delivery, good price. Just real nice stuff.</li>
    <li> I chose this one because of the ratings over other products. It seems to be made of quality material, and sturdy. It doesn&#x27;t have an instruction manual so I&#x27;m using the internet for that part. All in all it was a good buy.</li>
    <li> Great set, one tool in particular has become my go to for cleaning my pores.  Very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> If you know how to use it they might have been more helpfull</li>
    <li> I watched someone use similar products on youtube &amp; it worked perfectly for them. I heard that it doesnt leave scarring. I have white heads on my chin that i cant get rid of &amp; when i pop them w/ my fingers it scars really bad. these tools left a little scarring just not as bad. it did get a lot of my whiteheads though. im not in love w/ the product but i will continue using it. i will try to post another review after a few more uses</li>
    <li> Good set of tools for my teenager&#x27;s acne.</li>
    <li> Great product! Has a tool for everything! Love it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have many white head zits, but for those ones these extractors are perfect. Using these for the deep, painful acne I rate it a 4. I can&#x27;t get it to work as well as perhaps a professional could while doing it on another person; it is challenging to see and extract some of the acne, and the tool does an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; job overall. I like having this in my bathroom, but I think I had higher hopes for this product.</li>
    <li> I was impressed by the super fast shipping and packaging!! I love the case these came in and the best is all the options :) really like that I have an alternate way to take care of blimishes!</li>
    <li> product for review: Overall this is great product. It works and is of GREAT sturdy and durable quality.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I did not like about this product would be the case it comes with. The case itself is fine, but the bands holding the items in place is not very practical. The hooks removers are easy to remove, but difficult to put back in. Although I guess I could just purchase another case that reflects my character!! :) In the end, this is a great product of quality that gets the job done. I would highly recommend this company and item. Shipping was also fast!</li>
    <li> Amazing product....cleaned out all the whiteheads on my face!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son.  He uses it often and say it works great.  Nice kit.</li>
    <li> The tool set comes complete with everything you would need.  I was very satisfied with its various tools and for the price, it&#x27;s a very hard deal to beat.  The quality of the tools are very good and I would recommend this product to anyone.  Shipping was also a pleasure.  It arrived when they said it would.  Overall, I am quite happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Happy Customer</li>
    <li> These tools are very nice quality, smoother and better made that the any store bought brand. I read all the reviews before my purchase and noticed that one reviewer wrote, \\&quot;You don&#x27;t need the whole set.\\&quot; Well, they are right, but each person is different, and who knows which tool is right for their particular skin sensitivity? I certainly didn&#x27;t. Bit I tried out every tool to see which one worked for me, and at such a great price, it seemed silly to buy one at a time and do the trial and error approach. This is a great set.</li>
    <li> So cool  even my 13yr son uses it</li>
    <li> This is a great set!! It is way better than spending the same amount of money for a single one.  I got it because I have long finger nails and I was causing a lot of scarring using my nails to pop my blackheads.  I can select the right tool for my pimple needs and my acne inflammation is just about completely gone.  I works so great I got a second one for my sister&#x27;s birthday.  She loves it too!!! This is so worth it if you have stubborn acne of any type.</li>
    <li> The tools are of high quality,  and overall have a real nice feel to them when holding them during use. I would certainly recommend this kit as it has everything you need.</li>
    <li> It works best when blackheads or pimples are at least 1 mm large.  Overall, it&#x27;s a good kit to have.  Glad to have made the purchase.</li>
    <li> Great set, much more than I expected.  Would give 5 stars if they included instructions on how to use all of the various tools.</li>
    <li> Beautiful kit,  sturdy metal. Not really sure it works.  I tried it a couple times and nothing happened.  Maybe instructions or tips might be useful.</li>
    <li> Nice job, decent quality tools, case is not bad. This price ($15) for this case with these tools is definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> Tools in the kit are as described. Knowing how to use the kit will depend on the rating given. It is best to use warmth to bring comedones / blackheads to a &#x27;head&#x27; where they can be more easily removed with less pressure applied to skin. Less pressure reduces possibility of tearing hence less scarring. This kit with an astringent and cotton balls is a good start to begin your clean face journey. Just remember to cleanse with each use. Tools are sturdy and seem durable. Package arrived on time and the price is quite affordable - a great deal!</li>
    <li> I have this set for more than a week and so far used it for a couple of times already after my do it at home facials. So far I have been happy with it and it is very useful for me. It comes in a nice storage and comes handy when travelling. The grip is good thus making it more easy to handle it when I&#x27;m cleaning my face. The set doesn&#x27;t look cheap to me its actually very useful! Great product!</li>
    <li> Very useful in getting those stubborn ones!</li>
    <li> I saw these tools being used on the Doctors show.  I am so glad that I found these tools. My teenager is always asking me to pop a pimple.  I disliked pressing my nails and getting his pimple goo on my hands. After using the fingernails the area seemed more irritated. These tools are strong and sturdy.  There small enough to focus on the area. The directions that came with kit was very helpful.</li>
    <li> I was delightfully surprised by the small size of the tools and case, which is no bigger than a case for eye glasses. The tools are sturdy, well-made, and did not bend even slightly when I went to use them on my face. Now, the only problem is going to be finding the uses for all 10 tips! I am on Day 3 of having this kit, and have only used 3/10 of the tool tips on my face with any success of extraction. Maybe I can learn to solder/ pick locks with the unused ones. I love love LOVE the &amp;#34;lancer&amp;#34; they&#x27;ve included in this kit. No more fishing around for safety pins and a lighter! Overall, easy to use, but it will take time to develop technique and efficiency.</li>
    <li> My husband loved it.  He always has to have all sort of gadgets.  Product was as described.</li>
    <li> A very complete collection of tools for removal of blackheads. Good quality.</li>
    <li> Very good set of tools for removing blemishes! Thank you!</li>
    <li> wish it came with a manual or instructions on how to use each tool</li>
    <li> Okay, we&#x27;ll I&#x27;ve always sorta had this bad habit of picking and end up with scarring because of my olive skintone, but a couple years back after turning 18 I started having really bad breakout and was always tempted to try to &#x27;pick&#x27;. I started scarring a lot more and ended up more frustrated and stressed out, but I remember i used to visit an esthetician who used similar tools on my face to  perform &amp;#34;extractions&amp;#34;, and I wouldn&#x27;t have any scarring afterwords. So in a leap of blind faith and not really sure what I was getting to I bought these, I bought the whole kit, all 5! The product arrived super quickly, I was really excited to try them out as soon as I got them, when I first tried them I was saddened and became easily discouraged and thought it was a &#x27;bust&#x27;, so the 5kit just sat around my room in solitude for two or so weeks until I decided I&#x27;d give them a try again, its like having a new toy and not knowing how to work it, so I prepared myself this time and watched a couple youtube vids with people using similar looking extraction tools, and attempted to mimic what I saw and viola!! Like magic I had learned how to use it (sorta), so far I have only mastered (learned) how to use three of the five tools, my quest is still far from complete but I&#x27;m am EXTREMELY happy with my purchase and I&#x27;m glad I took the dive and bought these i use these so so so very often and they great thing is I.DONT.SCAR, when I use these tools to do extractions. I&#x27;ve used them for the blackheads on my nose, pimples on my face, those weird semi wannabe blackhead I get sometimes on face, and It works for all of it. Now something to note though is that there is a method to how you use each tool and what part of your face your using it on also. Like for example I use the long loop for blackheads on my nose, for blackheads or wannabe blackheads that are on other parts of my face like my chin, cheeks, forehead I use the loop with the shorter handle, and for pimples I like to use the rounded loop. When your using the loops though you want to bring it towards the edge to make it easier to remove, it you apply on center and just press down you won&#x27;t really achieve much doing that. If you get too confused on how to use these just remember.. Youtube is the savior (in this case), so try to look up Manuals, guides, instructions, how-tos anything that will help and make sure your properly disinfect your tools after each use. Also to keep your skin clean, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend applying things like makeup onto skin after doing extractions because that can clog pores. The reason I give it four stars and not five is because the tools are SOOOOO GOOD!! But there&#x27;s no manual or guide with it so it is definitely confusing for those who have never used anything like this before or just don&#x27;t know how to use it. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking or thinking of buying something like this.nded loop.

    <li> Nice, tidy unit with five tools of various shapes and sized loops to tackle any sized pimple or blackhead. Each tool has a nice weight to it. It&#x27;s not a cheap kit and the quality seems to represent the price I paid. Overall I am very happy with it and Yes I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that the logo on the pouch screams overkill to me. Maybe a subtle hue in smaller letters would have done it for me</li>
    <li> Awesome! Awesome! Tool.  Excellent on the go, Excellent as a gift, &amp; I love it. Before using the Blackhead Remover tool, use a hot towel on the pimple area.  This will make it easier to remove Acne.</li>
    <li> The tools are useful in some cases; but are too blunt for most blackheads.</li>
    <li> If you enjoy popping black heads or helping others, this will do the job and personally I have fun using these tools. It&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> Honestly my wife used them to clean wax out of my ears and they work great.</li>
    <li> These tool are very well made great that it comes with a case. And that is has instructions and tips on how to use them great the is had all the tools you need</li>
    <li> They work.  good deal...</li>
    <li> I find nothing in this kit to be effective.  Maybe instructions would help.  I wonder who the people are that gave this thing high marks.  They must work for the company that sells these  things.</li>
    <li> A short manual on how to use the instruments might come in handy. Without it, you generally have to guess which one is good for a given problem.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit because I have pores that respond better to flat-ended removers (forehead, chin) and pores that respond only to more round-ended removers (nose, cheeks). The shape of the remover at the end makes a big difference and I bought this kit because it includes both kinds. Each tool is rugged steel and the $14.95 price is the best I could find anywhere. They work great and it&#x27;s nice to have them all in one case. I have been buying (and losing) them separately for years.</li>
    <li> a good kit for facial care ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it just that I do not know how to use these tools properly, but I don&#x27;t like them at this point. Maybe I&#x27;ll google it one day when I can make myself care.</li>
    <li> These tools are too damaging to the skin. They damage the skin and don&#x27;t remove the problem.&lt;br /&gt;I was so hopeful but alas... I&#x27;m very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning this item.</li>
    <li> I learned about this Utopia care on YouTube, young lady in the video explain, how it works. In addition, this kit bruise my face, around chin area and cheeks. I would not recommend this kit!!!</li>
    <li> Much cleaner and easier than using your fingers</li>
    <li> Great blemish remover!  My preteen loves to use this instead of hurting herself by squeezing and picking her pimples.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really expect what I recieved for $12.00. The set is very nice ,well worth the price, even the case is surprising well made. The tools themselves are easy to use ,no rough spots on the metal.</li>
    <li> Just be careful and sanitize it before and after use.</li>
    <li> It is great deal. I am satisfied</li>
    <li> Looked ever place I knew of until I checked Amazon out,.  Perfect kit and priced right,</li>
    <li> its a good one. like it! I guess this one is wort buying. This product really helps me a lot.</li>
    <li> Pretty good quality, nice, neat and convenient! It definitely worth the money! It is good for deep cleaning and routine facial.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 5 stars not only for the quality of the tools included but for the customer service and shipping as well. For the price you CANNOT beat this kit. All the necessary tools to make you feel confident again!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! The case makes it super easy to keep everything organized and in one place. The tools are super way to use as well and the different varieties make it easy for the bigger and smaller problems on your face.</li>
    <li> This product really does what it claims to do and that is clean out your pores. I used it on my face and on my husbands back. You just apply pressure and the dirt and oils just come right out. I was give this product to review and i recommend it because it truly works.</li>
    <li> Very good quality nice packing very fast shipping time and price. recommended 100%</li>
    <li> Good Product but 3 of them are almost same, I brought this for my wife and daughter and they like it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Waste of money. I want my money back.</li>
    <li> This is a very well made kit.  Especially considering the low price.  It works as advertised.  Instructions would be nice but a google search will net what you need.</li>
    <li> Quality product @ a great price.</li>
    <li> Well, they work quite well. Only thing I&#x27;ve seen is that you have to be very gentle when pressing on your skin to clear the pores, otherwise you can get little red marks on the pores that last for at least a week or so.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS VERY WELL!  I&#x27;VE ALREADY USED IT A BUNCH OF TIMES.  IT COMES WITH A VERY NICE CASE AS WELL.</li>
    <li> This kit comes with everything you will need to pop a pimple.  These tools were reasonably priced and arrived quickly.  I would  recommend this kit to anyone who has acne or an occassional pimple.</li>
    <li> Not as easy to use as some I&#x27;ve had used on me by professionals during facials.</li>
    <li> I had a roommate in college who had a tool that removed blackheads. It was awesome and all of the girls wanted to use it. It allowed you to clear your pores without damaging your skin more with all that pushing and pulling trying to clear the white or blackhead. I have thought about that tool for several years and finally decided to look it up on line. I found several options and chose to order this kit from Utopia Care. I am very pleased with it. It has several skin care tools that come neatly packaged in a small, storage case and it was a great price. It works well!</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just love it.</li>
    <li> This item does not come with instructions.... But I went on YouTube and got some idea on how to use atleast one of the tools. It would be great to have some idea on how to use the other tools. FYI, remember to steam and cleanse your face well to avoid  damaging your skin.</li>
    <li> Great tools, good quality.</li>
    <li> Im 48 years young and have never had acne problems except for those pesky blackheads.  Even as a teenager, the dermatologist stated that I needed to us dove with each face wash and they will go away.  Dove never worked.  I have over the  years used various tools, and yes, I know about scarring.  If one does it correctly, there should not be scarring.  Fingers crossed still... I have been lucky!  When i came across this product, wit seems to have everything except a piercer, which I have a few of those.  So perfect.  However I did not detect that my husband needed &amp;#34;pimple poppers&amp;#34; as he calls them.  For santiatary reasons, I purchased his own kit.  He loves it and no more asking where my popper is. Of course, at times, I still jump in to get either the Whopper Pimple or those hard to reach.  Seems that so far, we have not needed any other tool that was not in this kit.</li>
    <li> Works nicely.  I really didn&#x27;t need all the tools that were included..but certainly got my money&#x27;s worth.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have received your items in a very nice case and they are extremely useful.  I have used similar tools for keeping my skin free of blemishes and these are superior.  Thank you for your product!</li>
    <li> Product is ok.  Haven&#x27;t used much.  Don&#x27;t know what arrow tip us for.  Case us nice.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> These are very sturdy tools and are well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Great product. Well made and wires don&#x27;t bend like other cheap models.</li>
    <li> Very high quality tools, neat package.  Effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried these in the past and one end usually breaks off after a while. This kit is nice and sturdy and has a lot of tools in it for all sorts of uses. I would recommend this product, it&#x27;s only a few more dollars than a single extractor tool and you get all these!!</li>
    <li> Kit is excellent!  Fast shipping, too.  Highly recommend both product and seller!</li>
    <li> Great tools, good quality and came fast.</li>
    <li> Came exactly as described</li>
    <li> Unique tools that I had been searching for awhile.</li>
    <li> Well-made, definitely does the job.</li>
    <li> Good set for the money.  Well made tools in a nice case.  Very pleased with my purchase.  Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> great value, seller was very helpful. Thanks</li>
    <li> My lady has a great time cleansing my blackheads with these.  Woo!</li>
    <li> For the normal everyday blackheads - it&#x27;s a bit much.  I didn&#x27;t find anything useful about this kit but I don&#x27;t have acne - these tools are for much bigger problems than I have.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and seems to be of good quality. Now if I can just figure out how to use it.</li>
    <li> Variety in a nice storage pouch. Low price and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, awesome product.</li>
    <li> Good quality tools but the lance is pretty large. I personally wouldnt want to lance Anything with it. Other than that, the rest of the tools are great. It didnt take long to get to me either.</li>
    <li> Excelent! This help me a lot with my acne</li>
    <li> This, along with the facial sauna I purchased, has really helped to keep my skin bump free.</li>
    <li> Are we all getting the same thing?? I have to wonder, since my set is junk - dull colored metal of some sort, clearly not &amp;#34;surgical grade stainless steel.&amp;#34; The case was useless once you removed any of the tools because it was impossible to put them back in: the tools were held in place by a very tight elastic band, and since the tools have deeply etched middles (think rough to the touch), the elastic catches on the tool making it impossible to slide it back underneath the elastic. The point on the tool pictured in the center was not pointy at all - just blunt. The loops on the tool shown on the left weren&#x27;t even symmetrical and had uneven welds at the point where the loops were meant to join into a continuous circle. There were rough areas on every tool but one. Reading some of the positive reviews here, I cannot believe we are all getting the same set.  Maybe you&#x27;ll be one of the lucky ones who gets a well made set of surgical stainless steel, maybe you&#x27;ll be like me and get what I got - junk. In the trash it goes.&lt;br /&gt;p.s. I have attached photos trying to show the poor quality of the metal used, the assymetry of the loops, and a photo with two tools side-by-side meant to contrast a tool from this set with a much higher quality tool I also bought from amazon - note the difference in metals - the bottom, shinier one of the tools is more symmetrical, has a better grip (not so rough cut), is of better quality metal, and is NOT from this set. I&#x27;m not the best photographer, but I hope these help.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as I expected but very useful none the less.  Good price. Great delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> I first gained knowledge of this device after watching an indian dermatologist use these to operate on his patients. I was previously unaware such a contraption existed; nevertheless, it&#x27;s one of the most helpful and useful bathroom accessories I could own. Being only 17, I still face the horrors of hormones and often get pimples, blackheads, and other blemishes all over my face. This kit does wonders if you use it right, it includes numerous tools for nearly every situation and is nearly painless. For best results-- I find it easier to turn the shower on with the heat setting on max, let your bathroom fill with steam and then water your face off. Your pores should be a lot more relaxed, making the process purely simplistic. The case is small and of decent material, and the tools are easy to clean as well. Definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Clean and convenient case</li>
    <li> Good product. Very strong and fast shipping</li>
    <li> The tools seem a little bigger than they appear. I hope measures of each can be provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally quite handy to use.</li>
    <li> Great products! Exactly what I wanted and expected. Affordable, got here quick, and it made of a high quality material, like at the salons.</li>
    <li> Very nice set, i love it! defintely alot easier getting rid of blemish and not having to worry about scarring</li>
    <li> I have an issue with zits forming in areas where it is very difficult to deal with them. Particularly problematic are the ones that form around the Alar Sidewall of the nose. This kit contains one tool that has been fantastic for dealing with these hard to reach juicers. This one tool has been worth the cost of the kit all by itself.</li>
    <li> These tools are exactly as described. They feel solid and are of good quality.</li>
    <li> Happy with this purchase. I have finally found a way to stop picking at my acne with my hands (which only makes it worse). My face has significantly cleared up since i started using these tools instead.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy steel. Would say even surgical quality. Shipped fast and on time!</li>
    <li> It did what it was suppose to but don&#x27;t press too hard it leaves a mark.  But it works well and I like it - wish I would have know about this sooner.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t use all the items that came in the package.  I only used 2 so far and I definitely need to watch a You Tube video on how to do it properly but they do work.  All the items are well made and came in right away after ordering.</li>
    <li> I wish you would have sent instructions with it.  It would have been nice.  to figure out what they all work on.</li>
    <li> Only really use the one with the bent end. Don&#x27;t really use the other ones. But found that the blackhead removers on here were around the same price as all of these combined. You get a zip case for all of them. The blackhead remover works well by nose and chin area. Just push and pull down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product seems sturdy and good quality</li>
    <li> Very useful set of tools in carrying case.  Well made.  Very good quality.</li>
    <li> i received this in the mail its awesome it came with 5 different tools it very easy to use and so much healthier for your skin then using your fingers great sellers and super fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great experience with this seller. Good product, good delivery, good price!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! I have acne prone skin it works great but u have to be careful so you want damage your skin</li>
    <li> This product works wonderfully!  I could not be happier with it.  The price is very reasonable, and it makes dealing with pimples much easier, cleaner, and quicker...and with a lot less pain!  It also doesn&#x27;t damage the skin, so I am 100% pleased with this kit :)</li>
    <li> This set is great. Made with excellent quality. Works wonderfully. Would definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> I have many small tools. These tools are high quality, well made, and strong. I&#x27;m impressed with this purchase. I would recommend this kit. The holder is also well made.</li>
    <li> The quality of the product is great, as a matter of fact for the price it exceeded my expectations,great quality, great price, great product</li>
    <li> I got this discounted item for testing and review purposes, Gosh, I&#x27;m so In Love this stuff! Very high quality Stainless Steel, Resistant to Rust and Tarnish, Easy to Clean. It Includes Lancing Tools, Needles, and Cone Dome Extractors, really had a fun using this stuff since got it. I promised myself to bring this always wherever i go, lol!  So cute and worked really good specially cleaning my pimples on my face. So very helpful, I&#x27;m so pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> These tools are nice and very quality. I do wish it would&#x27;ve come with better instructions because I haven&#x27;t figured out what all of them are for. Other than that they&#x27;re really great.  The bag they come in is also very nice and helps to keep them in a clean area.</li>
    <li> Number the case is cool. I tried out all but 1 tool (don&#x27;t need it yet) all tools worked wonderfully</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I had really big pores and lots o little blackheads in/on my nose area.  I read a few posts about how to properly use the tools and was amazed and the crap that was coming out of my pores! I have only used the tools twice, along with a facial exfol cream and my pores are almost non existent on the problem areas. If you do decide to purchase this, read a couple posts showing how to use them. I am not going to explain it because it is out there ad nauseum how to use these things. If you are looking for a surefire way to reduce pore size and crud in your pores, these are just about as perfect as things can get!</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping :)</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and was exactly what I was looking for. Seems to be made well and gets the job done. For those of you who say it didn&#x27;t do anything, definitely steam your facd or take a hot shower right before you do it. It opens your pores up so you can get all the gunk out much easier.</li>
    <li> The multiple instruments will give you a choice to choose the best one for your needs. They work great and will help to prevent scarring you may get by mashing with your fingers.</li>
    <li> All of the tools are either too small or too big. I guess I am just picky. Great quality for price :D</li>
    <li> For the money, very good but much of the instruments are redundant.  Also the quality of the items are sub par.  Still worth the money.</li>
    <li> Item was not was I expected.</li>
    <li> Very good for the money.</li>
    <li> I like it, best quality</li>
    <li> It was great, and has help me clear out my blackheads. I love the different tools available and found it painless and quick.</li>
    <li> Works great and the case is useful!  :)</li>
    <li> It works well, just got it and used it twice so far...I do wish there was a way to put one on about a 1 foot extension to reach my back</li>
    <li> High quality instruments in very nice case.  The extractors are much easier on the face than squeezing.  Cleaning the instruments can be tricky, but a Q-Tip with alcohol generally does the trick.</li>
    <li> Great item great price. It&#x27;s nice to have the complete set at a more than reasonable price in place of the high cost of individual pieces. Plus it comes with a nice carrier.</li>
    <li> I only really use the loop tool, but it works well.</li>
    <li> This little kit is amazing.  I bought it to replace my previous blemish remover which bent every time I used it until it finally broke.  But this kit?  I don&#x27;t see the tools breaking.  They do not bend.  These five pieces are stiff, strong and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another perk is the value.  This kit--all five tools and the case--was about the same price as my previous single tool.  And I love the case: no more searching through the door for the tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be daunted by the &amp;#34;hows&amp;#34; of each unfamiliar tool.  There are youtube videos available that show how to use each tool.  So, if you&#x27;re in the market for a kit... get this one.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product! I need to learn how to use them individually!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and non-expensive high quality toolset.</li>
    <li> Well-made and good assortment of tools.  The case is a nice addition.</li>
    <li> Great, precisely made instruments that are much higher quality than I expected- thank you! g-</li>
    <li> I dont have many zits but i get a break down once in a while and this cleans out the pores without damaging your skin awsome!!!</li>
    <li> When you press it into your skin the pressure required to pop a pimple (regardless of black or white head) also pops your capillaries, which really damages your skin. I strongly advise not using this on your face or on any skin you want people to see. However, it&#x27;s good for knocking out pimples you can&#x27;t reach, like on your back.</li>
    <li> Described perfectly and product was great!  Great Seller!</li>
    <li> These tools were great... just make sure you go on YouTube for instructions on how to use them properly lol. Lets just say i did some damage on my nose. Now that i know how to use the tools properly I can control my breakouts and prevent damage on my skin. Another thing make sure you steam your face before using these tools for best results in my opinion. You can steam your face by boiling water to a bearable temperature, then putting your face over the boiling water again at a temperate you can handle and like 12 inches over the pot, for about 3 to 6 minutes, then use these tools and your are your own dermatologist!!! You should also get a mirror that has magnification so you can see what your doing, or just get someone else to do it for you. I have been using these tools for about a month and my face has dramatically cleared up. I also stop using horrible acne products like Silica acid, benzoyl peroxide... look at this website very helpful i did not by the book just looked at what they had on the page Hope this helps someone ----&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah thats my story... great product, use them when ever I get a pimple and my breakouts heal in about 3 day rather than 3 weeks... Thank You</li>
    <li> The case is defective. It has a broken tooth so it will not zip up at a certain point. I expect the case to work when I buy something. Also the white lettering on the front of the case is coming off. So to make it even worse the tools are useless. They are cheaply made and just don&#x27;t work well at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this kit.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price. You need this! Everything is as advertised. I would buy again, for me or as a gift.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and it was exactly what was displayed and described.</li>
    <li> Wonderful and well-made tools! They are very easy to use and very solid. I was worried about the metal being weak and the tools being bendy but these are very well made. I would recommend this to anyone who wishes to purchase a blackhead remover as the kit comes with a variety of useful tools.</li>
    <li> Very well put together, professional grade, and cost effective. Not much else you can say about a purchase such as this.</li>
    <li> exactly what i was expecting</li>
    <li> Excellent quality products and the packaging makes it handy to keep nicely organized.  This is the first product I&#x27;ve purchased like this and am completely satisfied.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product with lots of versitile tools to get those pesky blackheads.  Plenty of sizes and good heavy steel quality.  Works great!</li>
    <li> Great product, worked better than expectes</li>
    <li> There are no instructions with the kit</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly, product was just as advertised</li>
    <li> The worst metal I&#x27;ve ever had. Does not extract either.  Quality is horrible</li>
    <li> Good for removing all sizes of blackheads and pimples.</li>
    <li> So when I heard about &amp;#34;extractors&amp;#34; I was intrigued and decided to purchase this set. So glad I did. While I don&#x27;t get zits very often when I do it is much easier to pop them using the tools in this kit. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got this kit for my 12 year old son.  After he watched a brief video on how best to use them on Youtube, he likes them a lot.  Handy, sturdy, travel size carrier for them.  Exactly as I&#x27;d hoped when I ordered them.  Good, solid quality.</li>
    <li> Ineffective, even following the directions.  The case and attachments are annoyingly difficult, too.  Went in the trash pretty fast.</li>
    <li> Pops the black heads out like butter.</li>
    <li> I freaking love it! Now when i pick my face i can blame the tools and not my chronic dirty fingernails! .. they work awesome.</li>
    <li> Very nice and useful product. Great value as well. I suggest everyone who purchases this product to do their homework first though. These tools are very effective if you know how to use them properly. At first I didn&#x27;t have much luck, a quick google search later and I was able to easily remove all of my unwanted blemishes with ease.</li>
    <li> These things are amazing. They really do the job once you get the feel for using them properly.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know, I was expecting something different. The holes at the ends of these implements are very large, too large to be useful in extraction of pimples. Maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to use them properly.</li>
    <li> These tools are well made, stainless steel, just the right size and a nice assortment. Nice zip close case. Very satisified.</li>
    <li> Great, easy to use! Lots for the price!</li>
    <li> Works great for removing blemishes. Finish on the metal is a little rough, but not so bad that it breaks the skin. Overall, good value for the money</li>
    <li> Delivered as advertised. Tools have a smooth, polished finish and are well-made.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a better product at removing blemishes.  It hurts and leaves large red marks after each use.</li>
    <li> A bit disappointed.  Tools with loops work the best.  Suggest watching tutorials on general tool use on UTUBE before purchase.  (some are pretty icky!)  While well made, they do not all seem to be from same manufacturer.  Handles are different.  A better use of $ would be the purchase of 1 or 2 more expensive tools that do work correctly.  The tool with the small hole in the middle did not work well at all for me even with preparation of skin.  I honestly don&#x27;t encourage purchase.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and well made.  Various types and sizes of tools that work well and seem like they will not break easily. A quality leather case with a zipper is included for storing the instruments.  Fast processing and shipment by Utopia.  Would not hesitate to order from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Very high quality kit and we&#x27;ll worth the $$. Shipping was fast too! I highly recommend. Made of metal and there are a ton of tool options.</li>
    <li> Not so great.  Lots of tools but not very useful in getting blackheads out.  Really don&#x27;t recommend it.  Don&#x27;t really think anything works on blackheads</li>
    <li> Wanted ti try new ways to help clear some annoying problems with blackheads and pimples. These versatile set of tools opened up some new ways to remedy this. Still new at it but the few times I have tried it worked and made it easier.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful high quality items!!! They have out performed my expectations. I highly recommend this product!  Not only does it work but I received it faster than expected as well. I&#x27;m so satisfied!</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and was exactly as described. Well made and works great! Get&#x27;s the job done and a good buy. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The tools work well and I and my daughter use them and they do not leave scars on your face. Like other reviews have said make sure to use the tools right after taking a warm shower or after you have washed your face with warm water. It is easier to us the tools when your pores are open. They are useful when you either have a small pimple or when you have a deep pimple, I wish I had bought these tools years ago.</li>
    <li> very nice kit to have...good quality utensils and casing.  If needed I would repurchase and even gift.</li>
    <li> These work well for what they&#x27;re intended.  I&#x27;ve only had occasion to use them twice so far, both times on areas I repeatedly get ingrown hairs on and normally can&#x27;t get to very easily like just inside my nose.  In those cases, I normally just leave the suckers alone and they bother me for a few days but these did the trick and the spots were gone within a day.  This set is a little overkill but if you don&#x27;t know what size works better for you it&#x27;s a good choice, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rather only knock half a star but what I did knock was for the pointed pick, which seems like it was intended for scraping and not lancing, as it&#x27;s not particularly sharp and only mildly pointy.  I haven&#x27;t needed it but played with it for fun.  If you need that kind of tip, I suggest sterilizing a fabric needle in boiling water and using it instead.</li>
    <li> I wanted a quality product and that is what I got.  This kit has everything you need at a very good price.</li>
    <li> Good tools, and they are not flimsy like some other tools. I would buy again for a friend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used similar blackhead removers in the past its easy to use and painless.i would personally buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;Fast. Reasonably priced. Solid steel. Not a cheap knock-off. What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> Great Product! Highly satisfied with the quality of the instruments, and the carrying case is very convenient!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have never used tools like this before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what shape/design to get, which is why I got this kit. That and the cost was very reasonable. They work and are easy to clean and the case is nice for storing. I gave it a 4 for the slight imperfections in metal finishing, but all the edges that come into contact with skin are smooth. I prefer using the wire loops anyway.</li>
    <li> I wish the product came with instructions on how to use each tool.  Otherwise the product was as described in listing.</li>
    <li> Good Stuff, nice finish on tools, the casing is not the greatest. Worth it for the price invested in it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves to use this on everyone. She sees a blackhead and she gets that look in her eye.</li>
    <li> Great product, as advertised.</li>
    <li> I like this case it comes it so that I don&#x27;t lose these. I have put them to use on my husbands back. Yea it might be gross but its the truth. They work great and there are many sizes and styles to chose from in this kit. Easy to zip right back up and store. I have paid this price for just one in my local store before so this is a great deal. I was sent this product free to review. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and it does just what it&#x27;s intended for I am satisfied and glad I purchased this now I can remove my black heads with out people noticing it you can see a huge difference.</li>
    <li> These are high quality metal and exactly what I wanted. I expected them to be a little bit cheap because of the price, but they were not. I would highly recommend. There are enough sizes for just about any pimple. Stop squeezing and picking today!</li>
    <li> Arrived ahead of schedule and everything was as promised!</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality set of tools.  Each piece is made of a very heavy gauge metal so there&#x27;s not worry of it bending while applying pressure.  For the low price I was very surprised.  I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> The tools are solidly made and decently sized for intended purposes. The case is compact and, so far, durable. I recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Good quality&lt;br /&gt;Should include directions,</li>
    <li> Most, if not all, of the tools work great. By far, for the low price, this is the best kit you can buy. Comes in nice zippable package. I easily recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a nice set. It is just as shown in the picture.  It can be a very helpful tool.</li>
    <li> Stainless steel, good construction and price.  The extractors didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped, but I don&#x27;t see how they could be designed any better.  Good choice of instruments in the set.</li>
    <li> This kit is very good quality, and a great deal!  Hours of blackhead popping, blemish oozing, OCD fun!  I am very happy with my kit, shipping speed, and the quality and would definitely buy one again - but I have a feeling I won&#x27;t need to!</li>
    <li> Very cheap materials. The case barely zips closed. The tools are fine, if not somewhat underwhelming.</li>
    <li> Great product. Came exactly as described.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I give this blackhead removal kit its rating because it was well worth it. Finding blackheads or other cosmetic issues and not having the right tools to get them out were hard to find. I&#x27;m glad I found these because they work and do a good job.</li>
    <li> Works great,  fast shipping.</li>
    <li> ...but NO DIRECTIONS! I&#x27;ve watched a few u-tubes and found their instructions of minimal use. I&#x27;m still experimenting and it should be noted that I don&#x27;t use the tools for pimples or even blackheads, but rather for some enlarged pores on my nose and chin that I want to keep clear. I just don&#x27;t know how best to use this dandy little kit with no illustrations or instructions. BUT- - a little discovery that others may find helpful: I have a Clairol face steamer I use first to open the pores and in which I prop the tools for about 10 minutes to sterilize them before and after use. This eliminates hauling out alcohol and cotton balls to clean the extractors!</li>
    <li> Im so glad i bought this! The tools are very sturdy, not at all flimsy, durable, and well constructed. The case is very nice too. Holds everything in place,  easy open/close, slim, quality materials, and again,  well constructed. I have no complaints at all. I&#x27;m very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using these tools right after you get out of a hot shower, or use a facial steamer. You could also place a hot moist towel on your face for 10 minutes. This softens up the skin and makes extractions easier and less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash hands thoroughly before you begin extractions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you sterilize your tools with alcohol before and after each use,  and in between each extraction, to prevent infection and spreading bacteria. (don&#x27;t forget the handles!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash face gently when done, and use a toner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only got the hang of using the spoon shaped tool with the poker on the other end. Works great on white and blackheads. Not sure if all the other tools are needed.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm awesome product!!!! Very good buy top quality</li>
    <li> There were no instructions for the various implements - which is crazy. I&#x27;ve tried several and NONE worked. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> 5 tools that are all pretty much the same. Low quality material</li>
    <li> Gave away to teenager. Says it works good...</li>
    <li> Came nicely packaged.  The case for the tools is nice too.  Not cheap at all. The tools look good quality.  Wish it came with instructions as to when to  use which tool.  Waiting to hear from the son how it works.</li>
    <li> Nice little gadget to your face.</li>
    <li> More than I expected.</li>
    <li> I like it it is working for me</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. Not the highest quality but that being said well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is a nice kit for the amount of instruments you get but my son doesn&#x27;t like them because it hurts when using.</li>
    <li> tools are not sharp enough to do anything with.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast . All excellent  quality instruments and in a nice heavy duty case. Was surprise at the overall quality of each tool and the case .  I&#x27;m not endorsing the use as I can still hear that &amp;#34; don&#x27;t pick at that &amp;#34; voice in the back of my head . But, you know you want to.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that the negative reviews for this blackhead remover kit were wrong, but they were 100% correct. This kit is crap. The quality of these tools is suboptimal, especially considering that they are used on your face. The amount of pressure needed to make to tools do their job is ridiculous. The lance is too dull to even attempt using it.</li>
    <li> It works great! And it arrived really fast! It&#x27;s a reasonable price for a 5 piece kit. Would totally recommend it to someone.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product really helps keeping your face clear</li>
    <li> Really neat products if you have excessive blackheads used several times already has paid for it self.</li>
    <li> very well made, I was surprised at how well this product was made, should do exactly what I want it to do.</li>
    <li> Cheap quality. Threw it away soon as I received it.</li>
    <li> These products are great, we have had some similar products in the past but this product has everything you need to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Bought it to have on hand for my son, haven&#x27;t used it yet. Looks like good quality stainless, nice pouch.</li>
    <li> Great set. High Quality. The case was very nice. Works great</li>
    <li> Great product....very heavy duty not like the cheapies that are out there. This set will last a looong time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a blackhead removal kit with various tools ever since I had a facial a few years back. There are so many ways to remove small blackheads, but I had some difficult-to-reach ones on the sides of my nose. These five tools helped rid my face of those blemishes quickly! I read the directions that came in the package and figured that to use these it would likely make my face red (which did happen), so I saved the process until a late weekend night. I&#x27;m glad I did. My face didn&#x27;t stay red nor inflamed for long (a little steam and a shower the next morning and it looked like nothing happened), but it was a chance I wasn&#x27;t willing to take given the way I tend to break out. Several days later I&#x27;m still reaping the benefits of these tools. I&#x27;m happy to have them in my arsenal of beauty products!</li>
    <li> got these to review they do job</li>
    <li> Works for all your blemishes. Will recommend to my friends. Shipping was fast</li>
    <li> This kit is AWESOME!  It is lightyears beyond the single chrome ones you find in the store.  Flat, non reflective finish.  Heavy duty construction.  Great grip and nicely weighted.  This is what I would expect a dermatologist would have in their office.  The case is small and very easy to pack.</li>
    <li> We have a household of teenagers and this kit works very well with little to no blemish after the fact. I wish I had this kit when I was younger.</li>
    <li> These should work okay one I get used to using them.  They are painful to use, though, and it does leave the areas I used them on red and painful for a day or two.</li>
    <li> This item arrived quickly and seems to be of good quality.  My daughter has used it several times and feels it works well for her.</li>
    <li> Works great and would recommend to anyone.Thank you for your great product and service.</li>
    <li> This is a really good kit. I know I&#x27;m not the only person obsessed with popping pimples (I&#x27;ve seen youtube--there are many of us), and I&#x27;m so glad to have this kit so my blemishes are less likely to scar and I&#x27;m less likely to be tempted to pick at them with my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice:&lt;br /&gt;Always, always, always sanitize your tools (rubbing alcohol pads available in the drugstore are great for this)&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t try to force a pimple/cyst to pop when it isn&#x27;t ready&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s best to do extractions after steaming the face--after a shower is usually good&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t know how to use a tool, search online or ask around. Don&#x27;t use them until you&#x27;ve got a good grasp of how to achieve what you&#x27;re trying to do.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected. No more. No less.</li>
    <li> get what you pay for, tools do their job!</li>
    <li> Awesome tools, professional grade!</li>
    <li> Good quality metal, nice case &amp; easy to use. No more fingernails or scars.</li>
    <li> Very good set of tools for removing blackheads and pimples</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teen daughter and she loves it. some of the tools she has yet to figure out how to use but the ones she has figured out works great.</li>
    <li> Granted, I rarely use it because apparently I do not have bad acne, but for the few I get monthly this set is divine. Firstly, it is stainless steel and easy to clean. Secondly, they are all very sturdy so you can squeeze with all your might without bending them. I like the variety so they can stand up to any challenge and the length is good too because I have managed to extract some in my back! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> still getting used to it...</li>
    <li> Works well, worth the money.</li>
    <li> Have some rust, not very good material.</li>
    <li> Well crafted, quality product - works well. Would be nice if there were instructions for proper use, or a link to online instructions for proper use. Had to find a video on YouTube, took a while to sift through the false results.</li>
    <li> The best fast and efficient!!!</li>
