<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Every once in a while a product comes along that is great for both external and internal use. This 100% organic seaweed powder from Kazu is one such product. Made entirely of kelp (with no additives whatever), it is especially good as a substitute for salt for flavoring food. It is entirely sodium free, and, unlike salt, is a rich source of proteins, minerals, and vitamins. Since I need to watch my sodium intake, I&#x27;ve replaced salt with this seaweed powder almost entirely. It also goes well as an addition to smoothies and other blended drinks. (Some of the vitamins and minerals in seaweed powder are: Vitamin C, Vitamin K, Zinc, Copper, Riboflavin, Folate, Calcium, Iron, and Magnesium.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there&#x27;s a lot more. It can also be mixed with water for making detoxifying masks and scrubs or as a homemade soap. While I haven&#x27;t tried it as a mask, I have made a soap from it, and it leaves my hands feeling soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for writing an honest review.</li>
    <li> During hot summer days, my face starts to feel really sticky and dirty. I use this wash my face and hands and I automatically feel more refreshed and clean! It’s really good for your skin since it is high in omega-3 content.</li>
    <li> I mixed this powder with a warm water and got my daughter and her friend to try facials with me, which was a blast. We made Shrek jokes as we smeared the green jelly over our faces. We even dragged my very reluctant teen boys into the experiment. A little bit of powder goes a long way, since it thickens quite a bit when mixed with water. It&#x27;s very finely ground, so there were no lumps, and it does appear to absorb facial oil, which is handy for anyone with oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for cooking, there is a distinct fishy scent, and the flavor is fishy, grassy, with a faint bitter finish. A pinch would go a long way in seasoning miso soup, and it would be fun to experiment with in savory cooking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in the mail in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Very versatile product!! You can eat it, drink it, or apply it anywhere on your body. When using it on skin, it feels very refreshing if you refrigerate the powder. Otherwise I believe this powder is best when drinking it because you get the most bang for your buck. Get as much healthy vitamins and minerals as possible by drinking!</li>
    <li> I used the Kazu 100% organic seaweed powder for a DIY mask that works great! I mix 1/8 teaspoon of the seaweed powder, with about one teaspoon of water, a squeeze of aloe vera gel or glycerin, and approximately 1/2 teaspoon of honey (adjust to your desired consistency) works fabulously to open up pores and remove toxins from your skin. My skin feels super soft, looks brighter, and my pores look significantly smaller. I love seaweed masks, and this is an excellent quality product for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any cons for this product except, the powder does smell like seaweed and increases when water is added, but all seaweed powders are like that (at least all that I have tried).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item received in exchange for review. All reviews, whether self-purchased or provided for review, will be completely honest.</li>
    <li> Can be used in smoothies and dishes for an added boost of healthy antioxidants and minerals.  Works wonderfully as a mask and as a detox bath!  Mix some seaweed powder in with water or aloe vera and apply to skin until it dries.  Rinse well and reveal smoother, firmer skin!  Add some to your bath as a nice way to detox your body!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I got to review this product. I&#x27;ve been hearing about all the benefits of using natural seaweed as a DYI face mask. Naturally, it&#x27;s the first way in which I used the product. I added the powder to goat milk and got amazing clarifying results after leaving it on for 20 min. The powder has very fine granules which also helped me in exfoliating as I washed the mask off. I am a believer! I&#x27;ve added small amount to my smoothies since it also can be taken internally. I think less than half a teaspoon is sufficient since it&#x27;s some pretty potent stuff. In studies, it&#x27;s said that consumption of this powder lowers LDL cholesterol, breast cancer risks, blood sugar and provides Iodine.</li>
    <li> I actually use seaweed powder to fertilize my houseplants. I grow 100% organic houseplants, which I sell on Amazon as an independent seller. I use seaweed in a few of my fertilizer teas and am always looking out for organic, high quality, powder that can easily be broken down and ingested by the enzymes in my plants&#x27; dirt. This 100% organic seaweed powder IS USDA certified. Keeping an eye out for the USDA label helps ensure you are receiving something that has been federally approved to be organic (no unnatural pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers were used while growing it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This powder is very very fine, which makes it great for using as a fertilizer. Because of it&#x27;s very light-weight make-up, it&#x27;d also make a great mixture for making facial scrubs and masks. I will sometimes do a foot cleanse, and adding a few tablespoons of this powder to warm water and let my feet soak in it. It helps pull out chemicals, naturally, from my body- and also leaves my feet feeling very clean and refreshed. I&#x27;ve never used this to make masks or scrubs, but I&#x27;d assume it would have the same refreshing feeling when applied to any other part of your body. Because of it&#x27;s high salt-content, it&#x27;s great for oily skin and acne, BUT on dry skin it can cause some minor irritation. Keep this in my mind. Depending on your skin type it can work wonders- but it can also dry out your skin a bit. For me and my oily/ acne-prone problems, this seaweed will work fantastic as a natural scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is very mild salty with a bit of an herbal undertone. I haven&#x27;t used it for cooking, but I&#x27;m sure it would make a delightful seasoning- especially on fish dishes. I&#x27;ve also heard that seaweed powder can be used as a vitamin supplement for canines and can actually benefit them greatly if fed in moderation. I&#x27;m not sure if this is true, but it seemed like a fun fact to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kazu packages all of their products very well. This powder comes in a resealable, secure, thick plastic bag that keeps it fresh and well-packaged. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with any of Kazu&#x27;&#x27;s products breaking open and spilling in transit, and I appreciate sturdy, heavy-duty packaging. This seaweed powder will easily be kept fresh with it&#x27;s zipblock top as well. I love packages that think long-term storage rather than instant use. For fertilizing I only use a small amount of this at a time and need to store the rest away. I like that this can be re-stored over and over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product. Comparable, if not better, than other organic seaweed powders I&#x27;ve used. A bit on the pricey side, but worth it if you want to pay for better quality.plastic bag that keeps it fresh and well-packaged.

    <li> I enjoy making this drink whenever I&#x27;m feeling that I need more omega 3 in my diet. It&#x27;s important to consume seaweed and get your seafood I your diet. Can also add this to my skin.</li>
    <li> I already take kelp capsules every day for all the nutrients.  If you&#x27;d rather not take pills, you can add this seaweed powder to smoothies (in small proportions), savory dishes, etc.  Kelp is really high in iodine and a lot of other minerals including calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, zinc, and copper (some of which are difficult to get in a vegetarian diet, in particular), as well as folate and vitamin K.  This looks and smells exactly like what is inside the capsules I take.  So if you are interested in nutrients from whole foods instead of supplements, this product could really be useful to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I do take kelp, I decided to try this product for the cosmetic benefits instead.  I have never done that before but I am always looking for the next big thing when it comes to skincare, especially skincare for the body.  I showered as usual, used my normal sugar scrub, and then massaged my outer thighs with a wooden cellulite massager to increase circulation before using the seaweed powder.  I have no way of verifying this, but I have heard that increased circulation to the skin results in better nutrient absorption, so I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, when I felt I had massaged long enough, I made a paste of this seaweed powder by mixing it with a little water and applying it to the massaged area.  It won&#x27;t all absorb into the skin (since seaweed like kelp has cell walls, which are made of cellulose and are insoluble in water) but I was hoping that some of it would.  After all, it is a fine powder so it has been ground pretty thoroughly.  After a time, I rinsed it off (takes a bit of effort as seaweed can really soak up water!) and toweled off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later on in the evening, I noticed that my skin was incredibly smooth and soft.  I don&#x27;t have a terrible cellulite problem, and I think it would take time -- and exercise -- to truly improve the appearance of cellulite.  However (and this could totally be psychological), I do think I saw a small effect with respect to cellulite as well.  And the smoothness of my skin was better than if I&#x27;d used expensive body butter.  I&#x27;ll be using this on my upper arms now to see if I can get my keratosis pilaris under control (if I do, I&#x27;ll update this review), and on my face as a mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a finely-milled powder that flows fairly freely (although flow is not perfect).  As long as you reseal it tightly (it comes in a zip-top pouch) and don&#x27;t let it get wet, it should retain that texture.  It will pick up a lot of water if you let it, so be careful in humid areas like bathrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sat around for a long time because I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do with it to test it out.  I am so thrilled that it is smoothing out my skin.  It didn&#x27;t irritate me at all, it&#x27;s organic, and it really seems to have had an effect.  I&#x27;m glad I took the plunge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the manufacturer for evaluation purposes.do think I saw a small effect with respect to cellulite as well.

    <li> so nutritious for adding it into any meal. It&#x27;s also good for your skin! My skin felt so much smoother after using this.</li>
    <li> Seaweed Powder is great to have to make the perfect facial mask. Just mix together a little bit of the seaweed powder with a few tablespoons of water &amp; a drop of peppermint oil and you have the perfect seaweed mask. Yes, there are probably a few seaweed masks mixture already available to purchase, but I would rather make my own as I don&#x27;t want any unwanted and harmful ingredients. Overall, I&#x27;m pretty impressed with the Organic Seaweed Powder and I recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I washed my face with it this morning and all my acne fell right off. Just kidding, but my face definitely felt more fresh and rejuvenated. This product will make your skin feel lighter, younger, and healthier.</li>
    <li> Acne is the bane to all teens faces, especially mine. After putting this on my skin every night, this seaweed powder helped me lose a bunch of acne. Fellas, this helps a lot with the ladies!</li>
    <li> Seaweed as we all know is very high in nutrition. This powder can be used for multiple purposes. It’s an interesting drink to mix with water, but I also like to add this into my Cetaphil cleanser since its a light abrasive and absorbs well into my skin. After using it daily I noticed my skin looked much more radiant. Call me crazy but I think it removed my unwanted skin lines and made my skin complex more “sharp”. Either way, it makes me feel great!</li>
    <li> Using seaweed to wash your hands?  Thats the first time I ever heard of such thing so i decided to try it.  It leaves a cool feeling after using it so its best for summer hot days!</li>
    <li> This was a very interesting product, I must say. I have never tried seaweed powder before, but I love seaweed so I decided to give it a try. What I found out that it tastes great as seasoning, it adds a lot of flavor to anything that is bland (i.e. rice etc.). Some people have even used it to help exfoliate their skin! Personally, I haven’t tried it yet but it sounds natural and a great cosmetic item.</li>
    <li> Woo this feels great to add to so many things!  I&#x27;ve been adding it to shakes and it&#x27;s great!  Such a boost, as it says!  Recommended for sure.</li>
    <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been hearing and reading about a lot of the benefits of kelp/seaweed powder (thanks, Dr. Oz!) and I was so excited to finally try it.  I tried it yesterday during lunch by sprinkling it into tuna salad that I made.  It has this great umami flavor--a subtle saltiness--that tasted great in my tuna, made better by the fact that it has the added benefits of lowering LDL cholesterol and being a great source of minerals like calcium, iodine, magnesium, etc.  I even sprinkled some over popcorn later in lieu of salt and I loved it.  I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s great for your skin--for masks and for help reducing cellulite (NOT THAT I HAVE ANY...) (but can&#x27;t wait to try:)</li>
    <li> This made an amazing face mask! I love trying new things for my face but am always skeptical because I have sensitive skin this worked great. The package had some great suggestions for other uses as well If I finally start to cook more I think I am going to try to use it rather than salt as recommended I&#x27;m always looking to cut my salt intake &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I tried this as both a mask and mixed it into my kale smoothie. In the smoothie, I could hardly taste it and knew I was getting a lot of amazing nutritional benefits. After the mask I noticed that my skin was brighter and more clear.</li>
    <li> I used it as a cellulite wrap.  It definitely left my skin feeling tighter and smoother.  I only used it twice and perhaps with more use it will get rid of my cellulite.  I will update.</li>
    <li> So, I initially use this as a salt substitute, but it simply doesn&#x27;t have a strong enough flavor to really excite my tastebuds.&lt;br /&gt;Now, as a face mask, this rocks! I&#x27;ve used products containing seaweed before for my skin, and, like those products, this worked really, really well! I have sensitive combination skin, and this helps even it out quite nicely!</li>
    <li> I use this stuff for everything. I put it in smoothies, but also on my face as well. It has so many health benefits I recommend it to everybody!</li>
    <li> Kazu&#x27;s organic seaweed powder has great nutritional value and I have been using it in smoothies and sprinkling it on my salads. It is great and doesn&#x27;t have a super over powering flavor or fishy smell which I had been concerned about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also excited to use it on my skin! It&#x27;s a great product with all the benefits of Seaweed!</li>
    <li> Kazu&#x27;s Organic Seaweed Powder is a very versatile product.  It can be used in food, facial masks, soaps and many other ways.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a nice smooth non-fishy smelling seaweed powder. The taste isn&#x27;t offensive, like some brands. You can add it to smoothies to improve the vitamin and mineral content. It even contains B-12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applied to the skin, Seaweed treatments act as a powerful detoxifier that draws out toxins and impurities while adding beneficial nutrients. It helps to stimulate the body&#x27;s metabolism and circulation which gives skin a healthy, revitalize and glowing appearance.</li>
    <li> I originally bought Kazu&#x27;s organic seaweed powder to add an extra nutritionist kick to my morning smoothies and juices, because as you may know, seaweed powder is full of nutrients and vitamins. The powder doesn&#x27;t overpower the flavor of my drinks and it isn&#x27;t fishy smelling like some brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package also gave me other great ideas on how to use seaweed powder, like in homemade soaps and as a skin moisturizer, both leave my skin refreshed and soft.</li>
    <li> Great as an additive to my green (vegetable) drink mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve added this and it adds a nice flavor to my green drink without overpowering it.</li>
    <li> I love seaweed but sometimes it’s a hassle to crumple it into your mouth. Well try the seaweed powder from Kazu, problem solved. Not only is it great for meals but it tastes great as well. It is easy to eat and delicious, what more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> I love this product because it is not loaded with salt.  It also provides you with the iodine requirements you need.  I also add this to my protein shakes, and it tastes great! Great price and great value.</li>
    <li> I was told that Seaweed is good for your skin so I bought this to use as a face mask. It is awesome it helps tighten your skin and shrink your pores. The package says you can eat it too in smoothies and as a soup. The only down side is the seaweed smell but it lowers once it dries. I would recommended this to people that doesn&#x27;t want to use chemical face masks since this is organic and real ingredients.</li>
    <li> I was recently introduced to 100% Organic Seaweed Powder and decided to use it in two different ways. First, I added a couple tablespoons into my morning smoothie for added nutrients. The seaweed is good for your skin, and it also has iron in it. It did not change the taste of the smoothie, so I was happy about that. I also tried it as a facial mask. I mixed about 1/8 of a cup of the powder with some Neutrogena Light Sesame Body Oil, and applied it to my face and neck. I left it on for about 15 minutes, and rinsed it off with warm water. My skin has never felt so clean and soft! I am looking forward to keeping 100% Organic Seaweed Powder by Kazu in my day-to-day health routine. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This powder has all the health benefits I need when I add a dash of it to my smoothies in the morning. The kids don’t even notice it when I add it to their smoothies—the perfect way to sneak in a little vitamin into their daily routine! Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This powder is a product that helps reduce the heat in the summer. It’s great for washing your hands or face to help cleanse your body of toxins. You can also use this as a tea also which you can drink.</li>
    <li> This powder is really interesting. Its coarse texture feels rather interesting, but when applied to my skin, it felt great! If I ever felt groggy, I would definitely use it revitalizes my skin so much.</li>
    <li> Free sample pack provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really nice in the bath.  It doesn&#x27;t dissolve that readily, but if you work it around a bit, it will.  The powder is just very fine.  I used a handful with each bath and that worked well.  It makes the water a sea green.  It&#x27;s nice to add some essential oils with it, because by itself it smells a bit briney.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves skin feeling tight, clean, and smooth, but what I really like about it is how relaxed it makes me feel.  It has magnesium and other minerals, vitamins and nutrients in it that absorb through the skin.&lt;br /&gt;It really tightens the skin.  I used it mixed in with dead sea mud on my face and it left my skin so tight it just pulled the finest lines and wrinkles on out.  I tried it alone, and that was nice, but it was great mixed with the dead sea mud.  Of course the effect is temporary, but it&#x27;s nice for a while.  In addition, it&#x27;s exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;The magnesium and iodine are absorbed through the skin.  You can also eat this- the bag states that it would be a good salt substitute.  I tried it, and didn&#x27;t find it all that salty and without that much of a taste.&lt;br /&gt;I will include it the next time I make up bath salts, and perhaps in my next batch of homemade soaps.  It&#x27;s a great ingredient and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the smell - it is a bit briney, almost fishy, but it isn&#x27;t very strong.  A few drops of essential oil covers it nicely.</li>
    <li> I bought this seaweed powder to add to my shakes and I liked the flavor it added and love the daily extra nutrients it&#x27; has added to  my diet. In addition, I mixed it into my usual exfoliant and in the end my skin did feel slightly softer, however I haven&#x27;t noticed a reduction in my cellulite but I&#x27;m willing to keep trying because all other outcomes have been great!</li>
    <li> I love a multi-tasking product I can use on myh skin and for food! I use some in smoothies and soups/stews, sprinkle onsalads, and added to a seasoning blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND I also have used it to exfoliate my face. The smell is neutral, not fishy. So you won&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re in the ocean! I love the idea from the package about making soap with it but haven&#x27;t tried yet. I like it in the bath and for the face..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything kAZU is so pure. I feel the energy through the package before even opening the bag. I love how I feel using the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow your BLISS,&lt;br /&gt;Ronda Del Boccio</li>
    <li> (Full disclosure: I received a package of sample products for review from Kazu, including a pouch of seaweed powder.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first foray into the world of seaweed powder. I&#x27;ve previously used nori, toasted and crumbled into small pieces, as a seasoning, and was curious how seaweed powder would stack up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed upon opening the bag was the smell: it has an earthy aroma that&#x27;s immediately obvious, though not overpowering.  The powder is quite fine, and readily blends into soups, smoothies, baked goods, and the like. I like to sprinkle a tiny pinch onto already-green soups (cream of broccoli, cream of celery, etc.) to give them a little extra flavor. The taste is more understated than nori-as-a-garnish, which I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the very first thing I did while experimenting was to try the seaweed powder in ice cream: a St. Patrick&#x27;s Day-themed Spinach &amp; Seaweed Superfood Ice Cream (recipe below!). A teaspoon and a half did the trick, giving the banana-based ice cream a subtle umami feel. Seaweed pairs surprisingly well with bananas, and the shocking green color provided by the spinach cuts down on the cognitive dissonance you might otherwise experience. This ice cream looks green, tastes green, and feels green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kazu&#x27;s Seaweed Powder is made of organic kelp, and is packed with vitamins and nutrients: Vitamin C, Zinc, Copper, Vitamin K, Riboflavin, Folate, Calcium, Iron, Magnesium and Manganese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;St. Patrick’s Day Spinach &amp; Seaweed Superfood Ice Cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Makes just under one quart of ice cream.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4-5 overripe bananas, peeled, sliced and frozen&lt;br /&gt;3 cups (4.5 ounces) baby spinach&lt;br /&gt;1.5 teaspoons seaweed powder&lt;br /&gt;sugar to taste (optional)&lt;br /&gt;a splash of non-dairy milk or creamer, if needed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Place the spinach in the food processor and pulse until the leaves are cut up into small pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Next, add the bananas to the food processor and pulse until smoothly blended. Most likely you’ll need to stir them by hand several times, as the frozen chunks tend to gather and become “stuck” on one side of the bowl. If necessary, add a splash of non-dairy milk or creamer to get things moving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternately, you can allow the bananas to defrost on the counter top for 30 to 60 minutes beforehand, so that they’re easier to work with. Before putting them in the food processor, break them up into smaller chunks with a butter knife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Since introducing extra liquids (such as non-dairy milk) into the mix results in a slightly icier finished product, I prefer defrosting to non-dairy milk. If you’re in a hurry, pop the bananas in the microwave for 20 to 45 seconds instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Add the seaweed powder and continue to process until thoroughly blended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Sample the ice cream. If the bananas aren’t sweet enough for your taste (sometimes this happens if you freeze them before they’re sufficiently ripe), add a bit of sugar to taste. Any sugar works fine – white, brown, etc. – but I find that powdered sugar results in a smoother blend. Add a little extra seaweed powder (a quarter teaspoon at a time) if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Transfer the ice cream to an airtight container. Enjoy immediately as soft serve, or pop the ice cream in the freezer for an hour+ for a firmer dessert. Store any leftovers in the freezer in an airtight container. If the frozen banana ice cream proves too hard to scoop, microwave it for ten seconds to help loosen it up (or let the container sit on the counter for ten to thirty minutes prior to eating, depending on room temp).the bananas to the food processor and pulse until smoothly blended.

    <li> After buying this product, I have to say it is the best thing. Plus it is not loaded with salt, to which is an added benefit. You get the iodine requirements and benefits easily. I add 1/4 teaspoon to my protein shakes.</li>
    <li> When I open the package there is a nice smell of the ocean and if you close your eyes... you can image taking a stroll along the beach.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mixed this powder with water to make a nice paste which I use as a mask.  You can add other things to the mask to change it up, such as honey. It rinses off easily leaving the skin soft and smooth. I really like it as a mask and love that it is a natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label notes that it can be used as a mask, scrub, additive to bath water, or as a replacement for salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Seaweed Powder supplied by Kazu.</li>
    <li> It was exactly as expected. There is no negative to its uses and health benefits.&lt;br /&gt;Use as directed and enjoy!</li>
    <li> I have a slight iodine deficiency, so while I take kelp supplements daily but I also try to eat fish and seaweed, since they are generally good sources of iodine. Well, since I can&#x27;t afford to eat sushi all of the time, I decided to try this, especially since this is 100% kelp. I sprinkled some on my rice, and it gave a nice subtle flavor to the rice... just a slight salty, umami flavor. I&#x27;ve taken to using it in soups and when cooking fish as well, and I&#x27;ve been happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea that it can be used for homemade soaps and face-masks/moisturizers/cleaners as well, but I like it too much as a garnish for my food that I don&#x27;t want to use it on the outside of my body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received a free sample in exchange for an honest review.</li>
