### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Use it as a shaving guide to achieve the perfect Abe Lincoln beard?  </li>
      <li>and it works great!</li>
      <li>The Respironics Chin Strap does an excellent job of holding my mouth shut, keeping my teeth in the corrective mouthpiece and allowing the passage of air through my nose.  </li>
      <li>but if you have sleep apnea, your best bet is to still see a doctor.</li>
      <li>and this is the best ever it keeps my mouth shut</li>
      <li>but this is the best I have found.  </li>
      <li>The chin cup has no stretch (ideal).  </li>
      <li>I end up flinging it across the bedroom, where the dogs give it a sniff and wisely ignore it!</li>
      <li>It does a great job of keeping my jaw from falling out of position while I sleep.</li>
      <li>This chin strap works great.</li>

      <li>Out of all the straps I have used, This one is by far the best.   </li>
      <li>In order to attempt control of the snoring symptoms, I wanted to try either a mouth guard or a chin strap to see which one worked more effectively for me, or a combination of using both at once.</li>

      <li>This is by far the best product out there.  </li>
      <li>The strap is very comfortable.  </li>
      <li>I Love it.</li>
      <li>If you suffer from sleep apnea (trust me, someone who sleeps with you will be able to tell the difference- that or try taping yourself one night while you sleep)</li>
      <li>It seems to work OK then since I&#x27;m not groggy when I wake up, but wearing it overnight is close to useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This strap sure beats lugging around the C Pap machine.</li>
      <li>The company seals them up and there are no returns so be sure you like it, you can&#x27;t try it without wasting $20.</li>
      <li>Then I make sure the velcro that is on top of my head is facing up</li>

      <li>This chin strap was ok.  </li>
      <li>it woke myself up, and now I sleep soundly most the nights.</li>
      <li>hope you enjoyed translation</li>
      <li>Perhaps if you&#x27;re bald, you might be able to glue the straps to your scalp....</li>
      <li>the one I received is surely damaged or incomplete--  </li>
      <li>Why end up with more problems than with you started with.</li>
      <li>and once I got the idea of how to use it, it is even better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using earplugs, not the wimpy over the counter kind, I&#x27;m talking super plugs, that you have to buy online.  </li>
      <li>the meterial is comfortable but it would be alot better if they figure out something else around the ears.</li>
      <li>I think a more detailed manual with many pictures on this strap&#x27;s fitting and usage would be of tremendous help.</li>
      <li>Not something easy to use all night ..  </li>
      <li>Foam rips easily.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t give up too easily.  </li>
      <li>It was easy to figure out and easy to adjust.</li>
      <li>This product is about the best available for its purpose, keeping one&#x27;s mouth closed at night.  </li>
      <li>I chose this one because it was advertised as a good price and most of the people who had bought it were satisfied overall.</li>
      <li>I bought a mouth guard (Zquiet) which works fine.  </li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t comfortable around the ears and fell off and got tangled easy.</li>
      <li>Fortunately for Respironics, the affordable price allows me to just write this off as another option crossed off the list</li>
      <li>That said, here are my important conditions:    </li>
      <li>He recommends a mouth piece that&#x27;s custom fit instead of a chin strap but for the money, I think it helped somewhat.  </li>
      <li>It may be of poorer quality than the genuine strap</li>
      <li>I now wear it every night, and sleep soundly through the night.</li>
      <li>Does what it&#x27;s suppose to an is extremely comfortable an infinitely adjustable.  </li>
      <li>and they didn&#x27;t fit correctly.  </li>
      <li>The Respironics Premium Chin Strap fit comfortably and probably did what it was supposed to do.</li>
      <li>I was able to wear this strap comfortably right from the package.  </li>
      <li>I know we all have our special needs for fit</li>
      <li>This one works great and lasts long!</li>
      <li>To clean I spray with water/white vinegar solution and wipe.</li>
      <li>Far more resistant to coming off at night than most straps I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Great product to keep mouth closed.</li>
      <li>I contacted Avalon Air, they admitted they do not sell the Respironics brand and offered a full refund.  </li>
      <li>The items I ordered were returned for a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this product really help me to sleep better.</li>
      <li>What I received is a true Respironics brand strap - and it&#x27;s great, supporting the chin vertically rather than pulling both upward and back.  </li>
      <li>So far I have found that the chin strap, when used in conjunction with an anti-snoring mouth guard does a pretty good job.  </li>
      <li>Also, it is stretching out quickly.</li>
      <li>maybe two if you&#x27;re lucky.</li>
      <li>I purchased this chin strip as an experiment to see if it will adequately replace my CPAP machine when I go on a whitewater rafting trip.  </li>
      <li>Obviously I&#x27;ll look for something that&#x27;s better quality and is more durable.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not that this respironics premium chin strap was super pricey</li>
      <li>This is as advertised, very comfortable (I was a bit surprised at that) and does what it is purported to do.</li>
      <li>The material isn&#x27;t very substantial but that makes it comfortable and not bulky.</li>
      <li>Now this one did fall apart after six months and if i washed it, but it is really worth it</li>
      <li>I thought it was worth a shot.</li>
      <li>and this product is effective for keeping mouth closed and being comfortable.</li>
      <li>Although this is a good product it is due for an upgrade in design.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m baffled by the reviewer who thought the lack of a slit on the right side is a manufacturing defect.</li>
      <li>If you put it on right, it will not move or fall off.  </li>
      <li>Respironics has it right with this product.  </li>
      <li>And while it certainly is adjustable to nearly every head size the overall quality isn&#x27;t great.  </li>
      <li>I have tried several different chin straps, even going so far as to try to customize one and this one works great for me!  </li>
      <li>These little things like the chin strap or mouth guard may work for you, but getting some professional advice will most likely do the most good.</li>
      <li>Mine arrived a genuine respironics product and quite comfortable, however it is made in mexico and began falling apart during the second hand washing.</li>
      <li>I bought another type and it looked like it was cookie cut out of some large sheet of material and smelled strongly of something like a new shower curtain.</li>
      <li>on&#x27;t know why you would want to pay mroe or look for a \\&quot;higher quality</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as described, makes the face sweaty and hot, and causes a rash as a result.</li>
      <li>I used it the first night</li>
      <li>The ball prevents me from laying on my back while sleeping and thus relieves most of my snoring according to my family.</li>
      <li>It looks funny but is not uncomfortable.</li>
      <li>This item is OK if you&#x27;re only taking a nap for an hour.</li>
      <li>Obviously I will not be able to bring the CPAP,</li>
      <li>This price is right where it ought to be; some other companies are selling them for alot more which is pretty rediculous after I got them home</li>
      <li>It has a slit on one end and no specific method or place of attaching it to the main portion that goes on top of your head.</li>
      <li>Do it the same way every night and it is easy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I placed an order, but immediately cancelled it when I looked through the reviews and saw that this was NOT A RESPIRONICS BRAND! It&#x27;s a knock-off by Avalon Air and from the reviews I read not nearly as good.</li>
    <li> Everybody is different, and this may not work for everyone, but I have completely stopped snoring since I started wearing it.  Considering the low cost, I&#x27;d recommend giving it try.  It takes a few days to get used to.  It will occasionally slip off at night, but that&#x27;s not a big deal, any sleeping aid is bound to do the same from time to time.  Other reviewers have mentioned it making their jaw sore...but that&#x27;s if you wear it too tight.  I suggest for starters, wear it loosely, and tighten it a little bit each night until you find your comfort zone - a compromise between over tightening or too loose to stay on.  I used to snore so bad it woke myself up, and now I sleep soundly most the nights.</li>
    <li> Out of all the straps I have used, This one is by far the best.   If you put it on right, it will not move or fall off.  I Love it.</li>
    <li> This item is OK if you&#x27;re only taking a nap for an hour. If you&#x27;re wearing it overnight, FORGET IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strap is stretchy and has a tendency to come off in the middle of the night which defeats the purpose of having it. The instructions are rather vague about how to attach the strap, but it&#x27;s just a Velcro strap so it doesn&#x27;t need a lot of instruction, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing this strap at night while wearing a Breathe-Right nose strip. Almost every night, I wake up and have to put the strap back in place because it has fallen off or slipped down around my neck. It rarely stays on the entire night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also worn the strap in the afternoon taking an occasional nap. It seems to work OK then since I&#x27;m not groggy when I wake up, but wearing it overnight is close to useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to sleeping on my side (I don&#x27;t snore as much), not on my back, but this strap makes it near impossible,  so it&#x27;s somewhat self-defeating. I do not use an anti-snore mouthpiece, but am considering it to see if it will help. If it does, I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
    <li> This device never worked to stop or reduce the snoring. I bought it and tried it but the wife said it never really worked to stop or reduce the snoring.  I bought a mouth guard (Zquiet) which works fine.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I got this item for my husband. It looks nice, but without the CPAP machine, my husband still snores. The strap alone does not stop snoring.</li>
    <li> This was NOT A RESPIRONICS BRAND! It&#x27;s a knock-off by Avalon Air.  I have been using the Respironics brand of chin strap and these copies were not the same quality as the name brand.  The sellers description and photo showed a Respironics brand when I ordered.  Only after I contacted them did they add the disclaimer that these were copies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I contacted Avalon Air, they admitted they do not sell the Respironics brand and offered a full refund.  The items I ordered were returned for a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful with this seller.  You may not get what you ordered.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this strap for a few months now. It started out working really well but the overhead straps have stretched quite a bit causing the fit/tension to be pretty loose. Due to this extra slack I can just barely get it tight enough now to be effective. I have to basically stretch the right strap over my head to my left ear.    I was unaware at the time of purchase that this item was in fact not a genuine Respironics strap. The one I received is an Avalon Air brand. It may be of poorer quality than the genuine strap but I have never used the Respironics strap so cannot vouch one way or the other.     After this strap becomes totally stretched out and useless to me I will be looking for a different one. I do not plan to purchase this strap again.</li>
    <li> This is nowhere near the quality of the Respironics strap. Pure garbage and a waste of $15. This vendor should be banned from Amazon for selling these as Respironics. I now see they have a disclaimer on their listing but it was not there when I ordered or I wouldn&#x27;t have... I would have given it 0 stars if Amazon would let me...</li>
    <li> The Respironics Premium Chin Strap fit comfortably and probably did what it was supposed to do. Unfortunately, while it kept my mouth closed, I merely snored through my nose. So, as far as my wife is concerned, nothing changed with the purchase of this product.  Fortunately for Respironics, the affordable price allows me to just write this off as another option crossed off the list and I won&#x27;t waste time sending it back!  Overall, it may work for you and not cost you an arm and a leg to try it and see!</li>
    <li> This is the only chin strap that has done the job.  Every other one I have tried has either not prevented the mouth from opening or has fallen off in the night--or both.  This one works great and lasts long!</li>
    <li> If the strap is put on properly, it will work. I stopped the CPAP machine because I could not tolerate the air blowing up my stomach, no matter what the pressure setting. So I decided to just try keeping my mouth shut and sleeping on my side.  The other chin strap styles are not comfortable nor do they stay on,or are very expensive. I no longer snore, or wake up in the middle of the night with anxiety attacks, or with a mouth so dry that my tongue hurts, since I started using this strap. I just ordered two more, because the old one is getting a little loose after 2 years constant use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this chin strap, because I don&#x27;t feel confortable and i can&#x27;t sleep when I wearing this chin strap.Also the quality and material are this very unconfortable.</li>
    <li> I ignored other reviewers that complained about quality and brand name.  I shouldn&#x27;t have.  I will be notifying Respironics next that this company is illegally using their brand to sell their own products.  I&#x27;m pissed, but given the price it&#x27;s hardly worth going through the trouble to return it.      Other than it not being as it was described, the one I received is surely damaged or incomplete--  There is no possible way to configure it so that it an ANY way resembles the photo.      This item is literally pure trash.  Others that review it as anything else must have received a different product-- so consider this your warning.  You&#x27;re playing roulette when you buy from this company.</li>
    <li> I was able to wear this strap comfortably right from the package.  I have a TMJ disorder so I use it in conjunction with a bite guard.  It does a great job of keeping my jaw from falling out of position while I sleep.</li>
    <li> Please think twice about this item before buying. I have had a problem with snoring and thougth this is a safe way to start by trying to fix the situation on own. I used it the first night and my husband complained that I was still snoring so I thought I needed to adjust it a little tighter. Well I did and I am sorry I used this product. It has affected my jaw and can feel pressure in the alignment of my jaw. I think it can be easily misused and you can end up with serious problems with the alignment of your jaw. Why end up with more problems than with you started with.</li>
    <li> I would consider this product &#x27;almost&#x27; a life saver.  I have severe sleep apnea and currently use nasal opening adhesive strips and a soft plastic mouthpiece which moves the lower jaw forward to keep the passage behind the throat open.  These help, but at sleep, my mouth tends to fall open defeating both these aids.  The Respironics Chin Strap does an excellent job of holding my mouth shut, keeping my teeth in the corrective mouthpiece and allowing the passage of air through my nose.  That said, here are my important conditions:    1. I would not wear this strap without a corrective mouthpiece.  Otherwise,it would tend to pull the jaw back blocking the airway.  2. When wearing, I would use adhesive nasal strips and nasal sprays to keep the nose clear.  3. Learn to wear the strap properly (by following directions and looking at the pictures).  It&#x27;s easy to get it wrong.  4. Spend time adjusting both the straps for comfort and effectiveness.  Heavy use of Velcro makes wide adjustments easy.  5. Take time getting use to it.  Don&#x27;t give up too easily.  There will be a lot of nights you&#x27;ll simply take it off.             I think a more detailed manual with many pictures on this strap&#x27;s fitting and usage would be of tremendous help.</li>
    <li> The first night, I had the chin strap off before I woke up the next morning.  I think the next couple of times I managed to keep it on all night.  I was told that there was no significant difference in my snoring, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a bad product.  It was just an inexpensive POSSIBLE solution to my snoring problem.  Now, I&#x27;m on to the next, more expensive step.  I did, however, look absolutely ridiculous.  So don&#x27;t expect to avoid getting made fun of by your significant other.  The chin strap was fairly comfortable and did not easily fall out of place.</li>
    <li> Ordered this along with a mouth guard to try and alleviate snoring problems. I have suffered from sleep apnea previously and through 2 surgeries my symptoms have been mostly relieved for the apnea episodes. However, my wife and my son both let me know recently that my snoring has returned and was quite loud at times, enough to wake my son up who sleeps some 30 feet and one room away from me. In order to attempt control of the snoring symptoms, I wanted to try either a mouth guard or a chin strap to see which one worked more effectively for me, or a combination of using both at once. This was to see if either one worked before investing in a professionally designed mouth piece from my dentist.  My results were good but I am still testing. Unfortunately, the mouth piece seems to have been lost in the mail and a new one is being shipped, so I can&#x27;t comment on the effectiveness of the mouth guard alone or in use with the chin strap. Using the chin strap alone, however, was limited in its effectiveness. No matter how tight I got the chin strap before falling asleep, it always seemed to loosen enough to allow my lower jaw to fall open during deep sleep and snoring to occur.  Since the chin strap alone was not effective in relieving my snoring, I tried another tried and true method to alleviate the problem, one my ENT suggested using long ago. Since I didn&#x27;t know that my snoring had returned, albeit without apnea episodes as before, I never really put the method to use.  Simple solution for me? Sewing a tennis ball into the middle of the back of an old t-shirt and sleeping with it on. The ball prevents me from laying on my back while sleeping and thus relieves most of my snoring according to my family. I did find at times when I first started this routine that even with the ball in my back I still found a way to somehow comfortably sleep on my back. I countered my body&#x27;s obsession to sleep that way by sewing a second ball near the first and so have not slept on my back forabout three weeks now.  I am giving myself another week to see if the the ball alone will relieve the snoring before I try using the chin strap again in conjunction with the ball shirt. I am also going to try to use the mouth guard once it arrives to see if that works as well.  I was a sleep apnea sufferer for over 20 years before finally getting some professional help to solve my issues. It took several sleep studies, two surgeries and a change of my habits to do so (along with some prodding from my wife and son), but going from 35+ episodes an hour to none in less than 2 years probably saved my life and prolonged it. These little things like the chin strap or mouth guard may work for you, but getting some professional advice will most likely do the most good. My problem was a deviated septum and a polyp that was blocking my nose airway and therefore I became a mouth breather when I slept. A mouth guard or the chin strap are not going to alleviate that issue, sorry to say.  Simple thing I&#x27;m trying to convey is sometimes it may take a little experimenting to get what works for you personally to relieve snoring. If you suffer from sleep apnea (trust me, someone who sleeps with you will be able to tell the difference- that or try taping yourself one night while you sleep) THESE DEVICES ARE NOT THE ANSWER! Been there and know the difference between the two. If its just an annoying sound from snoring, try one of these methods and hopefully they&#x27;ll work for you. If its apnea, try to get some help. Most doctors in the know say that sleep apnea is probably one of the leading causes for heart failure and for people who simply \\&quot;die in their sleep\\&quot;. Apnea usually damages the heart by causing arrythmia which is not good.  Sorry to be so long winded, will try to post more when my little experiments with these devices is concluded.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Respironics product to help eliminate snoring, but it is worthless. It doesn&#x27;t work as described, makes the face sweaty and hot, and causes a rash as a result. Go have a sleep apnea test and order a C-PAP machine.</li>
    <li> Mine arrived a genuine respironics product and quite comfortable, however it is made in mexico and began falling apart during the second hand washing. It was unusable after the third. So it will probably last you about a month, maybe two if you&#x27;re lucky. I have other chin straps, some generic non branded, that last three or four times longer.</li>
    <li> I have had no more complaints concerning snoring.  At the beginning the strap may bother... just a matter of getting used to it.</li>
    <li> my snoring did not change....by the time you wake up the strap is loose and not where you want it...</li>
    <li> I got this product after reading several mixed reviews on them.  This one was pretty reasonable comparted to some of the other similar products advertised out there.  It&#x27;s comfortable but usually comes loose halfway through the night and I end up just taking it off.  My ENT says the jury is still out on whether or not these types of products actually work but it seemed to help me a bit.  He recommends a mouth piece that&#x27;s custom fit instead of a chin strap but for the money, I think it helped somewhat.  My husband said I still snored but not as loud.  The main thing it did do was to help keep my tongue from slipping back and blocking my airway........at least for part of the night.  I would recommend it but if you have sleep apnea, your best bet is to still see a doctor.</li>
    <li> I use a CPAP machine with nasal pillows and was waking up in the middle of the night with an extremely dry mouth. Of course, this was due to me breathing through my mouth at night, so, I told my doctor and she prescribed me a chin strap, but it was on back order. So, I decided to look for one on Amazon until mine arrived. I chose this one because it was advertised as a good price and most of the people who had bought it were satisfied overall. I thought it was worth a shot. I have been using it and have been using it about a week and it works great! It was easy to figure out and easy to adjust. I figured it out without looking at the instructions. I would recommend this product for keeping your mouth closed when using nasal pillows!</li>
    <li> I hate that this is a waste of money.  It&#x27;s not that this respironics premium chin strap was super pricey, I&#x27;m just super disappointed it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hubby snores.  Not a gentle lawnmowerlike purr, I&#x27;m talking olympic sized snorts, huffs and growly grubbing noises.  The sound is so loud and disruptive, that most nights it would wake me, over and over, until I was lying in bed, seething with frustration, completely exhausted only to do it all over again the next night.  Naturally, The intense snoring didn&#x27;t bother him in the slightest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using earplugs, not the wimpy over the counter kind, I&#x27;m talking super plugs, that you have to buy online.  Wearing earplugs every night has several downsides, the first being that it blocks out all sounds, including our son, if he should call for me late at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This chin strap seemed like our salvation.  No pills, no scalpels, no sleeping with a mask on.  But it&#x27;s nothing more than a weird accessory, I can&#x27;t imagine what we&#x27;ll do with it now.  Use it as a shaving guide to achieve the perfect Abe Lincoln beard?  Hang small plants from it?  Wrap it around a bottle of wine and call it a bottle protector?  Attach horns to the top to make it into a reindeer hat?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, the one thing we wont be using it for is stopping my hubby from snoring.</li>
    <li> Not something easy to use all night ..  If you were forced to use a cpap you might be able to get used to it but not me   It wasn&#x27;t comfortable around the ears and fell off and got tangled easy.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different chin straps, even going so far as to try to customize one and this one works great for me!  I wear a nasal pillow C-Pap and need assistance in keeping my mouth closed and this does the job far better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. It has enough \\&quot;give\\&quot; to get in an out once the initial fit is done and then I only have to undo the back strap to take it off an on. I know we all have our special needs for fit but this is the best I have found.  The price made it even better!</li>
    <li> As much as I wanted this thing to work, it just wouldn&#x27;t stay in place on my chin.  The strap that goes behind the head is also a very poor design.  No instructions came with the strap so you&#x27;re left to use your imagination about how to attach the strip that goes on the back of your head.  It has a slit on one end and no specific method or place of attaching it to the main portion that goes on top of your head.</li>
    <li> This thing is awful!  In my opinion very poorly designed.  without the back strap the thing crawls forward towards the forehead.  But, getting the back strap on right is IMPOSSIBLE.  I find that my hair is stuck in all the velcro and it is too much of a challenge to actually get the darn thing on, tight enough but not too tight.  I end up flinging it across the bedroom, where the dogs give it a sniff and wisely ignore it!</li>
    <li> This is as advertised, very comfortable (I was a bit surprised at that) and does what it is purported to do.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use a CPAP or BIPAP machine but I do tend to open my mouth while sleeping and this product is effective for keeping mouth closed and being comfortable.</li>
    <li> I am reasonably happy with this item. However, when I received it, the slits that you pass the headband through were only on one side. I had to cut the other slit. Come on, I know the work is farmed out to Mexico, but jaysus, is it so much work to cut a second slit and seam it? NOTE: I&#x27;ve now noticed that the small strap you pass through the main one has the velcro wrong on one side. Makes it almost impossible to use. BUT: I have noticed a difference when I don&#x27;t use it. I feel more tired and I wake up with a dry mouth. So my complaints are mainly with the way it&#x27;s made. Can&#x27;t someone make one of these inexpensively that is well made?&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Thanks to the helpful comment posted, I amend my recommendation: It does not come with any instructions on how to use it and it is easy to put it on backwards, or wrong, or whatever. I am also noticing that after a month of use, the neoprene it&#x27;s made of is shredding and getting ratty. Also, it is stretching out quickly. You get what you pay for. I will be very selective the next time I purchase a chin strap. And by the way, comments that are not helpful will be answered with sarcasm, as I did with the one I got here. Be polite people, or I&#x27;ll answer in kind. Sorry to be so grumpy, but I snore, and I had a bad night last night.</li>
    <li> This product is about the best available for its purpose, keeping one&#x27;s mouth closed at night.  It is not perfect but it provides a very good balance between comfort and actually keeping the mouth closed.</li>
    <li> Whatever it is I received (not the whole strap, looks like just part of it) is worthless, so don&#x27;t waste your money.  No instruction, which if I received the complete strap I probably could have figured out.  A (1) piece of neopreme with Philips Resprironics silked screened on it, with some valcro strips that attach to nothing.  Would guess I was only sent one part of the strap.  Tried using it as a sling to throw rocks but worthless in that respect also.  Don&#x27;t buy it!!!!</li>
    <li> This chin strap works great. I like to camp out and travel. This strap sure beats lugging around the C Pap machine. I highly recommend it for those who want their roommates to have the ability to sleep in the same room or tent.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have used. I bought another type and it looked like it was cookie cut out of some large sheet of material and smelled strongly of something like a new shower curtain. Being sensitive to those things and suspicious of the safety I threw it away and went with this. Now this one did fall apart after six months and if i washed it, but it is really worth it and once I got the idea of how to use it, it is even better. First I loop one side that goes behind the head and shown it the manican (sp?) picture. Then I make sure the velcro that is on top of my head is facing up (it scratches my bald head). Do it the same way every night and it is easy. To clean I spray with water/white vinegar solution and wipe. I don&#x27;t soak it. Now if it got really smelly and cleaning does not work. I always keep a back up.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000QYC2P6 Respironics Style Premier Chin Strap]]Basically simple, well designed and sturdy. As advertised. Some slippage unavoidable and use of elastic limits the rigidity.</li>
    <li> This chin strap is poor quality, uncomfortable and will not stay on... a waste of money</li>
    <li> this product really help me to sleep better. I am not waking up in the middle of the night 2-3 times per night looking for glass of water anymore. the meterial is comfortable but it would be alot better if they figure out something else around the ears. it&#x27;s a little bit uncomfrtable around the ears, but once you fall to sleep, you wont feel it.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly; the chin strap works excellent at curbing mouth breathing at night. I wake up rested and peppy in the morning.</li>
    <li> Long time CPAP user. Great product to keep mouth closed. Key feature is that it is not as hot on my head as the old wide white headgear, but is still good enough to keep mouth closed.</li>
    <li> What I received is a true Respironics brand strap - and it&#x27;s great, supporting the chin vertically rather than pulling both upward and back.  The chin cup has no stretch (ideal).  The sides are stretchy enough to allow conscious jaw movement, but firm enough to reliably prevent a jaw from opening while sleeping.  Far more resistant to coming off at night than most straps I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Good luck keeping this on for more than 5 minutes.  If you move even slightly, the whole contraption  will start to slip off your head.  Perhaps if you&#x27;re bald, you might be able to glue the straps to your scalp....</li>
    <li> This chin strap is difficult to put on and it falls off during the night. Might work if I had a crewcut and bigger head.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to try because he snores loudly and wakes me up. It keeps his mouth shut but the air coming out from his lips makes horrible whistling and blowing sounds. That is worse than the snoring. The company seals them up and there are no returns so be sure you like it, you can&#x27;t try it without wasting $20.</li>
    <li> I just wanted something to hold my jaw closed while I was sleeping, so that I didn&#x27;t wake up every half hour with a dry mouth. This product looked as though it would do the job - at a reasonable price. And it does! I now wear it every night, and sleep soundly through the night.</li>
    <li> I purchased this chin strap thinking that it was a Respironics Premium Strap.  It isn&#x27;t.  Very poor quality.  Foam rips easily.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  If you have sleep apnea, go to a website that specializes in these types of products.  You&#x27;ll pay more, but will get something of much better quality.  Also, I&#x27;m surprised that Amazon is letting the seller get away with false advertising.  I compared this strap with a Respironics Premium Chin that I purchased off another site, and they&#x27;re different.</li>
    <li> i am german, so the review you want in this specific length comes in german:  das product ist sehr haltbar und sicher auch zuverlaessig zu tragen. aber es ist auch viel material zusaetzlich am kopf und ich persoenlich mag diese zusaetzlichen baender nicht am kopf haben. da ist mir doch ein etwas filigranes und nicht so voluminoeses kinnband lieber. aber wer gerne die ohren verschlossen haben will, fuer den ist sicher das band genau richtig.  hope you enjoyed translation</li>
    <li> Due to my sleep apnea I decided to by this chin strap hoping that using it in combination with my CPAP setup would net positive results.  Apparently the combo does work quite well together and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results.  And while it certainly is adjustable to nearly every head size the overall quality isn&#x27;t great.  I&#x27;ve had mine about eight months, washed it a few times, but the foam cushion parts are literally falling apart to the point that about all that&#x27;s left are the Velcro straps.  Granted the chin strap wasn&#x27;t a huge amount of money, but there were no indications as to how frequently to wash it, care instructions, or how long it would last.  At least now I know they&#x27;re essentially disposable short-term items that need to be replaced after roughly six months.  Obviously I&#x27;ll look for something that&#x27;s better quality and is more durable.  Keep all of this in mind and this option isn&#x27;t such a terrible choice, but you may want to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This chin strap was ok.  The instructions are not well written so it is confusing to know how to put the item together and put it on.  Only one side of the chin strap has a split for placing the band going around the back of the head.  The material isn&#x27;t very substantial but that makes it comfortable and not bulky.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many chin straps and this is the best ever it keeps my mouth shut and sometime I do not even wear my a-pap.</li>
    <li> Although this is a good product it is due for an upgrade in design. Would I buy another? Yes, I probably will.</li>
    <li> Maybe I require additional chins to keep this in place but it just keeps sliding up into my mouth. Waking up with nightmares that im a horse</li>
    <li> I ordered the chin strap and was told it wasnt in stock a week afterwards and then was told i could cancel my order if i wanted to so I did.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best product out there.  It did take me a couple of nights to get the tension adjustment correct; but since I have gotten used to the product it works great, is comfortable and I wear it every night.  This price is right where it ought to be; some other companies are selling them for alot more which is pretty rediculous after I got them home and they didn&#x27;t fit correctly.  I returned every one of them.  Respironics has it right with this product.  I totally hated the C-PAP device and this chin strap alternative keeps me sleeping and I dream again every night and the depression went away.  Thank you Respironics!!!!</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose to an is extremely comfortable an infinitely adjustable.  I on&#x27;t know why you would want to pay mroe or look for a \\&quot;higher quality item.\\&quot;  This thing does the job.</li>
    <li> The seller delivered as promised and is recommended.  I have all Respironics products and ordered the chin strap because I expected the same quality as all other CPAP items.  Within 2 weeks the liner started seperating. It doesnt have a very long shelf life.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with this product. I purchased it due to advertising that it would be an aid to stop snoring.  I tried this product several nights &amp; it didn&#x27;t help and in reading the instruction booklet there is no reference that it was even to be used as a snoring aid.  I wanted to return it for a refund but the instructions say I can&#x27;t return it as it&#x27;s a health product???  I am really dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> My doctor prescribed the CPAP machine for me.  While using it, I would wake up with a mouth so dry that it felt as if it was constructed of cardboard.  After ordering and using the Respironics Premium Chin Strap, I find that my mouth stays shut, and therefore moist, while I am sleeping.  Furthermore, I no longer need to bother with the CPAP machine.  This chin strap keeps my mouth shut, and as long as my mouth is shut, I do not experience sleep apnea.  The strap is very comfortable.  It stays in place/does not slip around during the night.</li>
    <li> I purchased this chin strip as an experiment to see if it will adequately replace my CPAP machine when I go on a whitewater rafting trip.  Obviously I will not be able to bring the CPAP, so I am searching for a way to prevent apnea/snoring without the use of electricity.  So far I have found that the chin strap, when used in conjunction with an anti-snoring mouth guard does a pretty good job.  This particular chin strap has worked better than others I have tried due to the part that cradles the chin.  If you are looking for a chin strap, this is the one to get.</li>
    <li> Chin straps help, but if your snoring occurs when sleeping on your back, as is true in most cases, here&#x27;s another trick:  drop a tennis ball in the toe of a soft sock, fold over or trim sock and pin it to the inside of a snug sleep tee, so the tennis ball stays centered on your back, between shoulder blades (approximately).  You can get serious and sew in a pocket, if you like.  You may roll onto your back, but you will not stay there.  Try it!</li>
    <li> This item is low-cost &amp; effective. I&#x27;ve purchased two identical ones from this manufacturer so that one is available while the other is drying. I bought them to keep my mouth closed while sleeping. Injuries force me to sit up in bed to sleep, &amp; my mouth drops open. Because the tightness is adjustable, &amp; it doesn&#x27;t cover the ears, it&#x27;s considerably more comfortable than any other I tried, all more expensive. I&#x27;m baffled by the reviewer who thought the lack of a slit on the right side is a manufacturing defect. He obviously didn&#x27;t examine either the photo or instructions. It would be extremely inconvenient if it were necessary to thread the other end of the strap through an opening after putting it on.</li>
    <li> The price was so affordable, I said why not try it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works as advertised.  It provides just enough pressure to keep my mouth closed during the night and I no longer wake up with a sore throat and dry mouth.  Since I live alone, I can only guess my snoring is diminished.&lt;br /&gt;I think people who have it fall off during the night do not have it adjusted correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, how can you not give it a shot?</li>
    <li> I ordered this chin strap to see if it would keep my mouth closed while sleeping. It took me a night or two to get it adjusted properly; I was not making it tight enough. I now sleep for longer times and no longer wake up with a dry mouth. It looks funny but is not uncomfortable. I ordered and received two more; one for a backup for use when one is being washed; the other because my wife wants to try one. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is an OK chin strap for the price, but I find it somewhat uncomfortable because it forces my jaw back too far.  Also, it sometimes comes off during the night.</li>
    <li> This product works well. I probably still need a cpap machine, though... I can definitely use it in the meantime.</li>
    <li> This product is a waste of money, granted it was only about $5.00, it was not work $1.00. It doesn&#x27;t stay put and definitely doesn&#x27;t stop or lessen snoring by any means.</li>
</ol>
