### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Very nice pads however.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find it here!</li>
      <li>These make up remover pads are absolutely the best for me.</li>
      <li>So, if you buy these, be sure to order a good supply of your liquid eye makeup remover of choice to use with them.</li>
      <li>It is a good , very mild eye makeup remover.</li>
      <li>Should&#x27;ve read more closely before purchasing.</li>
      <li>Let me start by saying I like Neutrogena products a lot, and have used many of them for years.  </li>
      <li>Great makeup remover, and much cheaper here than in the store.</li>
      <li>Com for allowing me to try and love, love, love this product at the &#x27;bestest&#x27; price.</li>
      <li>These eye makeup remover pads are just okay.  </li>
      <li>I was able at one time to find them in CVS, but no longer.</li>
      <li>They get an okay amount of makeup off but mostly just the powdery stuff.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love these because they are smaller and easy to just use on the eye area!!!</li>
      <li>The Reason I have given 4 STARS , is because I feel that the Packaging could be made more Travel Friendly.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t expect my eye makeup remover to smell like light perfume.</li>
      <li>Highly Reccomended for People Who Apply a Lot of Make-up OR Change Make-up , more than once a day .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;ll love these little babies! :-)</li>
      <li>It works great, and very useful when you are tired and want to quickly remove the eye makeup.  </li>
      <li>I only am able to find the full make up remover towelettes &amp; I don&#x27;t wear that much make up to warrent a full sheet.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a Highly Effective Product without any Side-Effects or other problems.</li>
      <li>Thanks again Amazon.</li>
      <li>If you use Lancôme&#x27;s Bifacil Make-Up remover, YOU WILL LOVE THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT IS LESS INTRUSIVE ON THE WALLET!!!&lt;br /&gt;P.S.</li>
      <li>I would recommend the product highly and I will keep ordering.  </li>
      <li>I poured a considerable amount (about 2 oz) of the Bi-Facial eye makeup remover into the container  and lo and behold, the Neutrogena pads worked!  </li>
      <li>These pads also have a light fragrance added to them, which is not cool since I have a sensitivity to fragrance.</li>
      <li>the above and check out the website \\&quot;Skindeep\\&quot; and&lt;br /&gt;Beautypedia to get the whole story.  </li>
      <li>and it is truly gentle enough not to sting at all.  </li>
      <li>Eyeliners and such need extra scrubbing with this pad which really irritates the skin.</li>
      <li>There was not enough wet product on the pads to do a lot of good without pressing hard several times.</li>
      <li>I really like these eye makeup remover pads, but, they are not as moist as I expected.  </li>

<li> I really like these eye makeup remover pads, but, they are not as moist as I expected.  </li>
<li> and I use it mainly to take off heavy eye liner.  </li>
<li> I would highly recommend, especially for those of us over age 35 who don&#x27;t want to tug at our delicate eye area.</li>
<li> the pad is soft and thick enough to be used for eyes</li>
<li> These removed my waterproof mascara, but only with a lot of heavy rubbing.</li>
<li> I can never find this stuff in the store, just an empty space where it should be.</li>
<li> I will stick with my other Neutrogena waterproof makeup remover instead.</li>
<li> &quot; so that&#x27;s a big duh on my part.</li>
<li> I purchase these monthly, but, not sure for how long.</li>
<li> My Daughter introduced me to Neutrogena Make-up Removal Cloths, that I typically purchase from Amazon.</li>
<li> The black liner comes off all the way</li>
<li> As others have mentioned, they were dry - as in no remover to speak of on the pads - so little in fact, that I thought they had dried out!  </li>
<li> I usually come in from work, take off my make up &amp; can get on with my eveing until I&#x27;m read to get showered for the night, when I then wash my face.</li>
<li> The Jar is Too Bulky for a Small Clutch or Purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Duh, it&#x27;s Amazon.</li>
<li> Takes off the eye make up effortlessly and doesn&#x27;t leave behind a greasy or oily feel.</li>
<li> at a time, thereby making it a very expensive proposition.</li>

    <li> I have been using this product for years.  It works great, and very useful when you are tired and want to quickly remove the eye makeup.  Will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> My Daughter introduced me to Neutrogena Make-up Removal Cloths, that I typically purchase from Amazon.Com. Found these and tried them because the price point cannot be beat! Duh, it&#x27;s Amazon.Com! Love, love, love these because they are smaller and easy to just use on the eye area!!! Thanks again Amazon.Com for allowing me to try and love, love, love this product at the &#x27;bestest&#x27; price. If you use Lancôme&#x27;s Bifacil Make-Up remover, YOU WILL LOVE THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT IS LESS INTRUSIVE ON THE WALLET!!!&lt;br /&gt;P.S.: I still purchase the Neutrogena make-up remover cloths as well, because the Amazon.Com price just can&#x27;t be beat! Now you go tell someone!!!</li>
    <li> the pad is soft and thick enough to be used for eyes</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I like Neutrogena products a lot, and have used many of them for years.  But the eye makeup remover pads were a big \\&quot;fail.\\&quot;  As others have mentioned, they were dry - as in no remover to speak of on the pads - so little in fact, that I thought they had dried out!  So, given this state of affairs, it&#x27;s unsurprising that they didn&#x27;t take off any eye makeup to speak of.  But thank goodness I had a sample of Lancome Bi-Facial eye makeup remover on hand! I poured a considerable amount (about 2 oz) of the Bi-Facial eye makeup remover into the container  and lo and behold, the Neutrogena pads worked!  Or should I say that the Bi-Facial worked on the Neutrogena pads.  So, if you buy these, be sure to order a good supply of your liquid eye makeup remover of choice to use with them.</li>
    <li> I received it about a week back.It is a good , very mild eye makeup remover. I&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for ages for an eye makeup remover that isn&#x27;t oily and also takes the eye makeup off.  I have found it!  There is no irritation around my eyes, in fact, the pads have a soothing effect.  Great product!</li>
    <li> There was not enough wet product on the pads to do a lot of good without pressing hard several times. Very nice pads however.</li>
    <li> Does not remove waterproof eye makeup.</li>
    <li> I really like these eye makeup remover pads, but, they are not as moist as I expected.  I have to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; at getting my eye makeup off.  I purchase these monthly, but, not sure for how long.</li>
    <li> I just re-ordered a jar and I use it mainly to take off heavy eye liner.  The black liner comes off all the way and it is truly gentle enough not to sting at all.  I would recommend the product highly and I will keep ordering.  I find it moist enough since I get in a hurry and I don&#x27;t want to get another rag to mop up any run off.  No odor.</li>
    <li> Too expensive...equate works and is cheaper</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot but will not reorder. As I read in some reviews, only one side is moist, and I found myself using too&lt;br /&gt;many at a time, thereby making it a very expensive proposition.</li>
    <li> These eye makeup remover pads are just okay.  They get an okay amount of makeup off but mostly just the powdery stuff.  Eyeliners and such need extra scrubbing with this pad which really irritates the skin.</li>
    <li> No thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Read the above and check out the website \\&quot;Skindeep\\&quot; and&lt;br /&gt;Beautypedia to get the whole story.  Get the truth.</li>
    <li> I can never find this stuff in the store, just an empty space where it should be. I was thrilled to find it here!</li>
    <li> Takes off the eye make up effortlessly and doesn&#x27;t leave behind a greasy or oily feel. I would highly recommend, especially for those of us over age 35 who don&#x27;t want to tug at our delicate eye area.</li>
    <li> These removed my waterproof mascara, but only with a lot of heavy rubbing. These pads also have a light fragrance added to them, which is not cool since I have a sensitivity to fragrance. Didn&#x27;t expect my eye makeup remover to smell like light perfume. I will stick with my other Neutrogena waterproof makeup remover instead. These are getting donated to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I just noticed that the ingredient list includes \\&quot;fragrance,\\&quot; so that&#x27;s a big duh on my part. Should&#x27;ve read more closely before purchasing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these remover pads for the last 3 years. I was able at one time to find them in CVS, but no longer. I only am able to find the full make up remover towelettes &amp; I don&#x27;t wear that much make up to warrent a full sheet. These make up remover pads are absolutely the best for me. It&#x27;s the size I need &amp; there&#x27;s no oily residue, I don&#x27;t feel as if I must immediately wash my face after using them. I usually come in from work, take off my make up &amp; can get on with my eveing until I&#x27;m read to get showered for the night, when I then wash my face. I say give them a try &amp; see for yourself. I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;ll love these little babies! :-)</li>
    <li> Great makeup remover, and much cheaper here than in the store. I am almost out of the pads, so I&#x27;m considering buying the refills.</li>
    <li> The Reason I have given 4 STARS , is because I feel that the Packaging could be made more Travel Friendly. The Jar is Too Bulky for a Small Clutch or Purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a Highly Effective Product without any Side-Effects or other problems. Highly Reccomended for People Who Apply a Lot of Make-up OR Change Make-up , more than once a day .</li>
