    <li> Product watered down. ..weak! Compared it dept. purchase, font and location of type in the same location as dept store product! I&#x27;ve used this product for 10+ yrs</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite scent. I love the scent of Jasmine in it. Every time I wear it I get compliments. It is my go-to scent all the time.</li>
    <li> Purchased this perfume as a gift for a family member. Product arrived quickly and as advertised. Price on Amazon could not be beat. Thanks for a great experience in every way.</li>
    <li> exelente vendedor lo recomiendo exelente producto muy puntual todo llego en buen estado segun lo acordado comprenle con confianza 100% recomendable</li>
    <li> The product title was deceiving.  When I first selected it, it said &amp;#34;Eau the Perfume&amp;#34; (which is the product I have bought from amazon in several occasions). I was ordering so many things that I did not noticed that in the last page the title did not red &amp;#34;Eau the Perfume&amp;#34;. (it did not specified anything). I received &amp;#34;Eau de Cologne&amp;#34;, which is a cheaper product. I learned my lesson, I will be more thorough from in the future.</li>
    <li> I prefer eau de parfum because is strong.&lt;br /&gt;The smell stay on the skin until the other day.&lt;br /&gt;In portuguese: eu prefiro eau de parfum porque gosto de perfumes marcantes e que permaneçam na pele at&amp;eacute; o dia seguinte.Para mim &amp;eacute; um perfume ideal para se usar no verao, pois embora seja marcante e um pouco sensual, &amp;eacute; bem floral e tamb&amp;eacute;m serve para o dia e a noite. Tem pessoas que usam no inverno...mas no inverno gosto de perfume floral adocicado como o Hot Couture (givency).</li>
    <li> I have been using Carolina Herrera for several years and continue to be pleased with the fragrance.  I still occasionally try something new but I always return to Carolina Herrera.  I have received more compliments from strangers, both men and women, than on any other fragrance.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when UPS delivered my package today! I thought $47.14 was a great price for a CAROLINA HERRERA For Women By CAROLINA HERRERA Eau de Parfum Spray in 3.4 oz size, as posted in Amazon. I just opened the box and it is NOT Eau de PARFUM, but Eau de TOILETTE! Geesh! I was so disappointed!!! Eau de toilette dissipates much faster; Eau de Parfum stays on your skin much longer. Needless to say, I must return :(&lt;br /&gt;In going through the return process, I contacted Amazon Chat, and the lady was very helpful - for which I rate Amazon 5 STARS!</li>
    <li> My favorite since it came out in 1990 or 91, stays on forever even through washes.  Love it!</li>
