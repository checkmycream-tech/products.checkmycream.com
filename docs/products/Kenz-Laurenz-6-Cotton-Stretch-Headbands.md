      <li>:)</li>
      <li>They are super soft, stretch nicely to cover her wound, and come in great colors.</li>
      <li>They are easy to use, and can be tossed in the wash.</li>
      <li>they fit</li>
      <li>but overall they were great.</li>
      <li>Love the headbands and the price was right.</li>
      <li>very comfortable nd pretty</li>
      <li>All of the other headbands we have tried squeeze her head too much, but these fit perfectly.  </li>
      <li>that i was able to pick all the colors, came fast and fit</li>
      <li>However, the price is totally right!</li>
      <li>They were very accommodating with the colors, love the options to pick and choose.</li>
      <li>I just can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
      <li>Very comfortable and exactly what I was looking for, but at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Received quickly and I will be saving this company for return purchases.</li>
      <li>They had mistakenly sent me a couple colors that were not my choices, and quickly sent me the ones I didn&#x27;t get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The headbands are nice, but wouldn&#x27;t fit a larger head size.</li>
      <li>super fun to coordinate .</li>
      <li>They were exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>I got them very quickly, the seller was prompt and professional, and I received all the colors I wanted.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping..</li>
      <li>Also, shipping was super fast.</li>
      <li>They came in much quicker then I expected (5days) and the quality is pretty good for the price as well.</li>
      <li>Second time ordering, will be getting more.</li>
      <li>I got exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>colors exact every time.</li>
      <li>Got exactly the patterns and colors</li>
      <li>I really like the pretty colors u can choose from I</li>
      <li>These don&#x27;t stretch much.</li>
      <li>The company is very responsive with pleasantry.  </li>
      <li>No slip headband stays in place my whole work shift, as a nurse..</li>
      <li>Each type of headband fit slightly different in tightness</li>
      <li>The shipping was really fast.</li>
      <li>I think the tie dye ones were slightly looser fitting then the solids.</li>
      <li>Great for yoga, and for working out at the gym or on a cold day walking around the neighborhood, Keep my hair off my face and they don&#x27;t slip off your head like these kind of headbands typically do.</li>
      <li>They fit pretty tight but my head seems to stretch them out.</li>
      <li>My daughter has long, thick hair and these are working great.  </li>
      <li>The colors are vivid, each headband is enclosed separately and therefore can be shared as gifts.  </li>
      <li>I was a little skeptical at first about picking my colors, but the seller was very prompt and friendly, and they arrived very quickly as well.</li>
      <li>They are fairly tight and stretchy so they stay in place as much as something made of cotton can.</li>
      <li>The only thing is that because they are so good at staying on, they are very tight and hard to get over your head to put down.</li>

<li> Her hair is very thick and very curly.  </li>
<li> They are not as wide as other yogi head bands but work just as well.</li>
<li> I got white, black, teal, neon green, brown cheetah, and teal zebra.</li>
<li> She has worn them to school with her hair down and to soccer with her hair in a ponytail.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Bottom line is, I highly recommend them and you really can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>

    <li> VERY GOOD FIT AND QUICK SERVICE.</li>
    <li> I like that you can pick which colors you want. The shipping was really fast. These are the same quality as what you would get at the pharmacy for 5 or 6 dollars each.</li>
    <li> What my daughter was looking for, seam is in the middle so they stay in place better.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and great quality!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> These are made of nylon or ??? rayon.  They were too tight for my head.  Because I could wear them, I gave them to friends.</li>
    <li> Love these head bands! They are not as wide as other yogi head bands but work just as well.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my sister who recently had brain surgery. They are super soft, stretch nicely to cover her wound, and come in great colors.</li>
    <li> The headbands are nice, but wouldn&#x27;t fit a larger head size. I have a small adult head and they are snug.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with these headbands! I can wear them with anything, they keep my hair back, and they are perfect for the gym! These headbands also came in a timely manner...I ordered them and with in 3 days of being shipped they were in my mailbox! All around perfect product and perfect seller!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my sister. She said they were extremely comfortable and she loved them! Probably will buy more!</li>
    <li> These are great headbands. They look and feel very soft, and I was very impressed with the quality given how affordable they are. Also, shipping was super fast. I put in an order on Friday evening, and received the items by Monday. And to top it all, the seller is amazing. They had mistakenly sent me a couple colors that were not my choices, and quickly sent me the ones I didn&#x27;t get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is, I highly recommend them and you really can&#x27;t go wrong with these. I will be repurchasing from them.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter.  Her hair is very thick and very curly.  These were great to have this summer to keep her hair up to help her stay cool.  The width was perfect.  Not too wide so that they slide off and not too thin so they weren&#x27;t able to manage her hair</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift, and they really liked them.</li>
    <li> Very nice headbands. Just a little snug for my head. Got exactly the patterns and colors I ordered.</li>
    <li> At first I thought they were great they held my hair in place just how I wanted but after 1 time using the band ripped</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with the stretch headbands.  The colors are vivid, each headband is enclosed separately and therefore can be shared as gifts.  The company is very responsive with pleasantry.  I will definitely order from them again and put them on our holiday gift shopping list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REJ</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t stretch much. Popped off my radio I have them to my nieces.</li>
    <li> They are GREAT!!  I love the colors and the width is perfect!!  Definitely recommended!!  :)</li>
    <li> Awesome headbands. Perfect stretch-fit, wonderful bright colors. They were exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> love love love. that i was able to pick all the colors, came fast and fit</li>
    <li> Yeah. The headbands are nice. I&#x27;m actually enjoying them.</li>
    <li> Awesome headbands for cheap! Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Great headbands.  Nice that you can pick out the colors.  We could match up with my daughters softball team&#x27;s colors.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on while I workout</li>
    <li> I use these when I wash my face and want to pull my hair back. They are easy to use, and can be tossed in the wash.</li>
    <li> I got what I asked for. I only wanted two colors and told them to choose the other color&#x27;s for me. I loved the colors that I picked, but I also love the colors they chose for me. They look great and feel fantastic on my head.</li>
    <li> Great for yoga, and for working out at the gym or on a cold day walking around the neighborhood, Keep my hair off my face and they don&#x27;t slip off your head like these kind of headbands typically do. The only thing is that because they are so good at staying on, they are very tight and hard to get over your head to put down.</li>
    <li> Love the Headbands! They were very accommodating with the colors, love the options to pick and choose. Each type of headband fit slightly different in tightness but overall they were great. I think the tie dye ones were slightly looser fitting then the solids. Overall I would buy them again.Thanks!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t as thick as I expected. Colors were nice so I gave them to my 11 yo daughter.  Although none of us have used them.</li>
    <li> They arrived quickly and have worked great!</li>
    <li> bought these to embroider for stocky stuffers, came super fast the colors are excellent</li>
    <li> Very good price, fit, color selection. Seller is excellent to deal with when selecting your color choices.</li>
    <li> These are great!  After you place your order, click on the link to email the seller and you get to pick your colors.  My daughter&#x27;s headbands arrived almost a week before the estimated shipping date.  My daughter has long, thick hair and these are working great.  All of the other headbands we have tried squeeze her head too much, but these fit perfectly.  She has worn them to school with her hair down and to soccer with her hair in a ponytail.  The headbands stay in place and don&#x27;t give her headaches.</li>
    <li> Very nice headbands though of not very high quality. However, the price is totally right!</li>
    <li> Love the headbands and the price was right.</li>
    <li> Daughter plays softball and loves them. Great price.</li>
    <li> Great product and exceptional customer service.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. They fit pretty tight but my head seems to stretch them out.</li>
    <li> I definitely recommend these headbands. I got white, black, teal, neon green, brown cheetah, and teal zebra. They came in much quicker then I expected (5days) and the quality is pretty good for the price as well. They are thick so they hold back my hair while exercising without sliding off. Some are a little snugger then others but at about $1 a piece you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I got these headbands for keeping my hair back while I run. I like the thicker ones, because my hair is too short to put in a ponytail, so these keep my hair out of my face while I run. They are fairly tight and stretchy so they stay in place as much as something made of cotton can. Absorbent too! I was a little skeptical at first about picking my colors, but the seller was very prompt and friendly, and they arrived very quickly as well. Great quality for how cheap these are!</li>
    <li> I really like the pretty colors u can choose from I wish I could have all the colors.. Some are tighter than the others though but it&#x27;s still good..</li>
    <li> Yes it did I like the colors n they fit</li>
