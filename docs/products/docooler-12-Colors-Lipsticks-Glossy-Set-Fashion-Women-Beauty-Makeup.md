      <li>The lipsticks are nice!  </li>
      <li>Good delivery time.</li>
      <li>I love the reds!</li>
      <li>These are cute colors although bright.</li>
      <li>Many of the pinks are very light, kind of pastel, and have a shimmer to them.</li>
      <li>are like more lipgloss</li>
      <li>I suggest they put these in better containers.  </li>
      <li>I would just pay more money to get a brand name.</li>
      <li>but I add a bit of shimmer of frost gloss on top.  </li>
      <li>[...]- I got free Clash of Clans gems here!</li>
      <li>Top players use this to get gems!!(6BWqjDtOj3)</li>
      <li>I received a variety of colors, and I love the pinks better than the peachy ones.  </li>
      <li>The colors are okay.</li>
      <li>Love the colors and the price although it would have been better it</li>
      <li>I love these because they gave me a chance to determine what colors I like without having to go to the store and spend $10 on each tube.</li>
      <li>Came on time colours are ok.</li>
      <li>but again, I love the pink shades the best.</li>
      <li>But its the pinks I really found nice, but the containers are a problem as the lids come off easily and dont stay on in my make up bag.  </li>
      <li>I liked it but the colors are not the same as like the picture the colors in the picture are more like popping</li>
      <li>The colors are cute,  but they dont paint very Well</li>
      <li>But I would just but clear chapstick and it makes it more easier to apply.</li>
      <li>then the product is worth, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
      <li>None of the colors seem to be right for me.</li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t smell right.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not going to send it back as it would cost more</li>
      <li>be me, when i first looked at it on amazon</li>
      <li>but when u get it it&#x27;s kind of jus bland</li>
      <li>but once i got them, i was really unsatisfied.....</li>
      <li>I buy this , but really i dnt like the colors</li>
      <li>i ended up throwing them out because i really didn&#x27;t like anything about the lipsticks</li>
      <li>i was really looking forward to receiving them</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed them drying out my lips any more than normal, and the color does stay for quite a long time.</li>
      <li>and more than half the colors dont show up on your lips.</li>
      <li>Cute colors and long lasting too.</li>
      <li>I was excited to received my order faster than expected</li>
      <li>texture is a little off the first time your use it, but it softens up right away.</li>
      <li>i had to keep applying it and the colors were not ordinary colors that would be worn frequently</li>
      <li>The colors go on thick and bright, and I like that, but apply carefully or they end up looking clownish.  </li>
      <li>I found myself wondering what it was that made my lips so soft</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s not a wide variety or colors.</li>

<li> Some of them came broken and a dry and the other ones came okay.</li>
<li> I apply lightly to my lips, add a touch of soft pale pink floss to tone it down or another lipstick that is pale and frost, and then its not quite so in your face looking..</li>
<li> Others are solid and remind me of the bubble gum pink crayon color.&lt;br</li>
<li> They are not as moisturizing as other brands</li>
<li> and i would definately not reccomend buying theese lipsticks they were not worth the money or the time.</li>
<li> but I was disappointed with the item because all of the lipsticks were exactly the same color..</li>
<li> My product was delivered all broken and all 12 of the lipsticks were red, will never purchase these again</li>
<li> Tues were dried out and after just one application broke off.</li>
<li> Waste.</li>
<li> The packaging was all banged up, the lipstick was hard and dried out.</li>
<li> Get yous too in less than two minutes!!</li>
<li> and you have to push it hard against you lips.</li>
<li> it wasn&#x27;t so hard</li>
<li> That is a little frustrating.  </li>
<li> I do not love !, almost no paint, the colors look</li>
<li> Poor bitch</li>
<li> I felt if I kept using them I would get sick.  </li>
<li> This is the worst product I have ever encountered.</li>

    <li> The colors are cute,  but they dont paint very Well</li>
    <li> I received a variety of colors, and I love the pinks better than the peachy ones.  They are not as moisturizing as other brands but I add a bit of shimmer of frost gloss on top.  But its the pinks I really found nice, but the containers are a problem as the lids come off easily and dont stay on in my make up bag.  That is a little frustrating.  I suggest they put these in better containers.  The colors go on thick and bright, and I like that, but apply carefully or they end up looking clownish.  I apply lightly to my lips, add a touch of soft pale pink floss to tone it down or another lipstick that is pale and frost, and then its not quite so in your face looking..but again, I love the pink shades the best.</li>
    <li> They. Just. Want to stole my&lt;br /&gt;Money 😡 eat the money. Poor bitch</li>
    <li> I liked it but the colors are not the same as like the picture the colors in the picture are more like popping but when u get it it&#x27;s kind of jus bland</li>
    <li> These are cute colors although bright. I found myself wondering what it was that made my lips so soft and I realized that it was either wax or it contained lead. Neither of which I want to put on my lips</li>
    <li> I buy this , but really i dnt like the colors are like more lipgloss No Lipstick:/&lt;br /&gt;Like for my lil girls ..</li>
    <li> I do not love !, almost no paint, the colors look</li>
    <li> I was excited to received my order faster than expected but I was disappointed with the item because all of the lipsticks were exactly the same color.. What a dissapointment</li>
    <li> Came on time colours are ok. Would recommend it</li>
    <li> Some of them came broken and a dry and the other ones came okay.</li>
    <li> Tues were dried out and after just one application broke off. Finally was able to get a tube that wasn&#x27;t dried out or broken and color came off three minutes later while still applying makeup</li>
    <li> This is the worst product I have ever encountered. Some of the lip sticks had such a foul odor.They didn&#x27;t smell right. I felt if I kept using them I would get sick.  and more than half the colors dont show up on your lips. I contacted the seller and they were giving me the run around.  They finally re fund my money. But would not answer my Qs as to if I received a contaminated batch or something.  They said the problem was me. I don&#x27;t recommend these.  I would just pay more money to get a brand name.</li>
    <li> Some of the lips don&#x27;t work well</li>
    <li> None of the colors seem to be right for me.</li>
    <li> My product was delivered all broken and all 12 of the lipsticks were red, will never purchase these again</li>
    <li> i had to keep applying it and the colors were not ordinary colors that would be worn frequently be me, when i first looked at it on amazon the picture that showed up was way different than what i received the  colors and the quality of the lipstick did not cut it for me i ended up throwing them out because i really didn&#x27;t like anything about the lipsticks and i would definately not reccomend buying theese lipsticks they were not worth the money or the time. i was really looking forward to receiving them but once i got them, i was really unsatisfied.....</li>
    <li> Waste. It&#x27;s like crayons</li>
    <li> I am so dissapointed with my purchase. ALL the lipsticks are the same color.</li>
    <li> [...]- I got free Clash of Clans gems here! Get yous too in less than two minutes!! Top players use this to get gems!!(6BWqjDtOj3)</li>
    <li> It came looking amazing! Love the colors and the price although it would have been better it it wasn&#x27;t so hard and you have to push it hard against you lips. But I would just but clear chapstick and it makes it more easier to apply.</li>
    <li> Cute colors and long lasting too.</li>
    <li> Great colors . Good delivery time.</li>
    <li> The lipsticks are nice!  At this price I am very happy with them.</li>
    <li> This is the driest lipstick I have ever used.  I&#x27;m not going to send it back as it would cost more then the product is worth, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> If I could give this no stars I would. The packaging was all banged up, the lipstick was hard and dried out. There&#x27;s not a wide variety or colors. Just don&#x27;t buy guys.</li>
    <li> The colors are okay. Some of the lipsticks are the same colors.</li>
    <li> I love these because they gave me a chance to determine what colors I like without having to go to the store and spend $10 on each tube. There are a lot of pinks, one orange, and about three reds. I love the reds! Many of the pinks are very light, kind of pastel, and have a shimmer to them. Others are solid and remind me of the bubble gum pink crayon color.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is a little off the first time your use it, but it softens up right away. I haven&#x27;t noticed them drying out my lips any more than normal, and the color does stay for quite a long time. Overall I&#x27;d definitely recommend if you&#x27;re trying to figure out what color you should wear, or if you just want a ton of colors to choose from!</li>
