      <li>Very easy to put together.</li>
      <li>Nice and sturdy and fits most polish bottles</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect to hold my essential oils</li>
      <li>I found with Jamberry lacquers, I was able to fit 42 on it!</li>
      <li>I would still consider buying more because of the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll need another polish rack.</li>
      <li>twice-- the first time, it came in perfect condition and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Met most expectations.</li>
      <li>but Soon I need to get something that will hold more nail polish😁</li>
      <li>I love how organized it look.</li>
      <li>Perfect for displaying my essential oils.</li>
      <li>well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product also came in great condition, very shiny, no scratches, and easy to assemble.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I knew my essential oil bottles would fit perfectly in them, and they do!</li>
      <li>Other than that, it works beautifully!</li>
      <li>Easy to assemble.  </li>
      <li>Everything is displayed where I can see it easily.  </li>
      <li>but it was a corner so easy to repair.</li>
      <li>Easy to assemble.  </li>
      <li>This rack would work for so many things that you need to access quickly.</li>
      <li>So easy to set up and super cute and clean to organize my nail polish.</li>
      <li>I use this rack to hold essential oil bottles and it works great.  </li>
      <li>Also, two of my screws didn&#x27;t fit</li>
      <li>I liked it so much</li>
      <li>Very nice, and even holds larger bottles.</li>
      <li>I was excited when I received this as I bought it to display my Doterra oils, which would have fit six 15 ml bottles per row</li>
      <li>It works very well for that purpose! :)</li>
      <li>You have to assemble it yourself- which would be fine if the manufactures drilled the holes in the right spot on both acrylic pieces.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle to return.</li>
      <li>I had to give it 2 stars because my nail polish rack came without some screws and the holes to assemble the rack were not in the right spot.</li>
      <li>so the size is right.</li>
      <li>I would suggest spending a little more money for better packaging and quality.</li>
      <li>Like them very much</li>
      <li>and it definitely could do with better pre-packaging.</li>
      <li>For the price, I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s worth it, unless you really need a caddy for your nail polishes, which was my case.</li>
      <li>Love this rack for my essential oils.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty upset.</li>
      <li>and they look very neat!</li>
      <li>Very sturdy!</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m cool with that I can live with the crack.</li>
      <li>From the product photo I was not sure it would the of good quality.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine for the purpose that it was made for, however, it is big and takes a lot of room.</li>
      <li>Arrived fast, this item was just what I was looking for</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very upset and will not be buying this again</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>Product came in with fast 2 day shipping.  </li>
      <li>My wife loves this and the price was reasonable too</li>
      <li>Right now I have about 35 bottles on it and still have room for a few more.  </li>
      <li>It arrived with a huge chunk missing out of the side (they were nice enough to put the piece in a normal zip loc sandwich bag)</li>
      <li>Perfect for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;There were a couple pieces broken, but I didn&#x27;t bother sending it back, I could live with it.&lt;br /&gt;Juliana</li>
      <li>I had to have new holes put in</li>
      <li>and I stack them on top of each other (without using the back plastic stand)</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and  the plastic is thicker than I thought it would be, it was much larger than I thought it would be too!</li>

<li> Unfortunately, one side had a piece missing out of it, the other side had a big scratch, and one of the nuts did not have any tread in it to secure the screw and hold it together.</li>
<li> Works as expected.</li>
<li> Only thing that was off is that one of the four screws that holds it together did not fit.</li>
<li> Furthermore, there were so many pieces broken off; some pieces that I couldn&#x27;t even find in the packaging, which makes me think that they have a bunch of these that are broken that they just send out to people.</li>
<li> I decided to purchase another due to an expanding nail polish collection, but the second one came with pieces broken off in the envelope and jagged edges.</li>
<li> But it&#x27;s a little damage</li>
<li> the side pieces do not fit flush like the photo shows.</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> and I had to buy screws because mine were missing.</li>
<li> so they take very little room.  </li>

<ol>
    <li> Easy to assemble.  Using this to display essential oils so the size is right.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. Two of the screws were stripped for putting it together.  Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love it!  Easy to assemble.  Very nice, and even holds larger bottles. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> Mine was cracked when it arrived. amazon packed it quite well so I belive it may have been cracked before it got to them. called them and they knocked off 10%. i&#x27;m cool with that I can live with the crack. Just using it for a display anyway. Amazon is Awesome!</li>
    <li> Cheaply made and came broken</li>
    <li> Perfect for my nail polish collection. I love how organized it look. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I liked it so much I bought a second one.</li>
    <li> Awesome awesome rack but Soon I need to get something that will hold more nail polish😁</li>
    <li> From the product photo I was not sure it would the of good quality. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. It&#x27;s very sturdy and  the plastic is thicker than I thought it would be, it was much larger than I thought it would be too! It holds all the different bottles shapes well. I was concerned about that. With this rack. It&#x27;s not an issue at all. I love it!! I have been on a makeup and nail polish binge lately. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll need another polish rack. I will buy another one of these when I do.</li>
    <li> So easy to set up and super cute and clean to organize my nail polish.</li>
    <li> LOVE this! It&#x27;s perfect to hold my essential oils and they look very neat!</li>

    <li> What a great price! I bought this because I knew my essential oil bottles would fit perfectly in them, and they do! This nail polish table rack arrived in great shape, and has held up well. I would order again!</li>
    <li> I like it! But it&#x27;s a little damage</li>
    <li> Awesome!! Thank you! Arrived fast, this item was just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I was excited when I received this as I bought it to display my Doterra oils, which would have fit six 15 ml bottles per row had I not had to return it. Unfortunately, one side had a piece missing out of it, the other side had a big scratch, and one of the nuts did not have any tread in it to secure the screw and hold it together. Had to return.</li>
    <li> This works perfectly for organizing my E-Cigarette / Vapor / Juices / etc at my desk. I imagine there&#x27;s a lot of great uses for this besides nail polish!</li>
    <li> Met most expectations. Only thing that was off is that one of the four screws that holds it together did not fit. I had a screw to replace it.</li>
    <li> I am using it in my art studio to store my alcohol ink. The bottles fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this and the price was reasonable too</li>
    <li> Product came broken but I glued it and still used it. Was disappointed. Wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle to return.</li>
    <li> Love it! Easy to assemble &amp; perfect for holding my nail polishes.</li>
    <li> Product came in with fast 2 day shipping.  Very easy to put together.  No instructions came with the product. Nice and sturdy and fits most polish bottles</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Very easy to put together.</li>
    <li> Excellent product..love it thank you</li>
    <li> Love this rack for my essential oils.  I keep it in the kitchen, so when I need a spice or blend, I just grab it off the shelf. Everything is displayed where I can see it easily.  This rack would work for so many things that you need to access quickly.</li>
    <li> Mine came broken and even if I wanted to fix it there were no screws to put it together.  It was very evident that it was put in the box broken.  I immediately packaged it for return.  I have not heard anything about my refund yet.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Shipped from Amazon and came in perfect condition. Depending on the size of your bottles, it may hold more then 36! I found with Jamberry lacquers, I was able to fit 42 on it!</li>
    <li> All my nail polishes fit in so happy because I have so many. Taking it with me to college.</li>
    <li> Great for my nail polish</li>
    <li> Came broken. Poor quality.  I&#x27;m not going to bother to even return it. Waste of money. If you buy this, keep your fingers crossed that yours doesn&#x27;t arrive broken. I&#x27;m pretty upset.</li>
    <li> It arrived cracked with a small piece broken off. Also, two of my screws didn&#x27;t fit so I had to use my own. Despite that, it does what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> While like quite a few others, mine came broken but it was a corner so easy to repair. Other than that, it works beautifully!</li>
    <li> This shelf works perfect for me. I bought it to display items for my vendor table. It works very well for that purpose! :)</li>
    <li> I had to give it 2 stars because my nail polish rack came without some screws and the holes to assemble the rack were not in the right spot. The screws were just thrown in the box. They should package the screws inside a small bag so they don&#x27;t get lost or forgotten. Also- this rack does not come assembled! You have to assemble it yourself- which would be fine if the manufactures drilled the holes in the right spot on both acrylic pieces. I had to have new holes put in and I had to buy screws because mine were missing. Once I got it together though it looked really good. I would still consider buying more because of the price. If the next one comes without screws or damaged I would suggest spending a little more money for better packaging and quality.</li>
    <li> If I had to guess I think they shipped me someone else&#x27;s returned piece of junk. It arrived with a huge chunk missing out of the side (they were nice enough to put the piece in a normal zip loc sandwich bag) two cracks on the opposite side and the side pieces do not fit flush like the photo shows. Fortunately someone I know has a use for it because I sure don&#x27;t!!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect..I put it together wrong but then I figured it ouy.</li>
    <li> Perfect for displaying my essential oils. Would be good for what it was intended for too, I guess. But I don&#x27;t use nail polish. LOL .. Well made. I really like it</li>
    <li> Very easy to put together. I&#x27;ve purchased this product twice-- the first time, it came in perfect condition and was exactly what I wanted. I decided to purchase another due to an expanding nail polish collection, but the second one came with pieces broken off in the envelope and jagged edges. Not safe at all and it definitely could do with better pre-packaging. Still not sure if I&#x27;ll be using it or not.</li>
    <li> I use this rack for my essential oils and I think it looks great and does the job of displaying my oils well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product also came in great condition, very shiny, no scratches, and easy to assemble.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what it should be! Very sturdy!</li>
    <li> When I got the product the delivery time was good but it came CRACKED and pieces were shattered. I&#x27;m very upset and will not be buying this again</li>
    <li> Love this! Easy to put together and looks great with all of my polishes!</li>
    <li> Use this for my essential oil bottles. Works perfect, it is just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Holes do not match up.</li>
    <li> I use this rack to hold essential oil bottles and it works great.  Right now I have about 35 bottles on it and still have room for a few more.  Makes a nice presentation.</li>
