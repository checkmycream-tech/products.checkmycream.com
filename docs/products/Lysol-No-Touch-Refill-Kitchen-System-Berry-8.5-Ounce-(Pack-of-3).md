    <li> Great product, but hard to find except online</li>
    <li> these no touch refill kitchen system refills were hard to find. really like this type soap.</li>
    <li> I purchased two 3-packs of this product. The packaging was apparently inadequate because one of the 3-packs was leaking when it arrived. One of the bottles had a crack near the cap which would have rendered it unusable. Since any scent of this refill is very difficult too find, I decided to try and rescue the remaining soap in the bottle by sealing the crack with nail polish. That worked so I got 5-1/2 bottles for the price of 6!</li>
    <li> So hard to find! Smells good.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed and the price was great.  Delivered right on time.  Thankyou</li>
    <li> Expensive but can&#x27;t be purchased in stores since the product was discontinued.  If you need a refill pry the top off the empty one you have and fill it with dish detergent.  Works fine with the system.</li>
    <li> Love this thing, although it&#x27;s very expensive...</li>
    <li> This is a really good product that I can no longer find in the retail stores. I do not know why. I purchased the system for myself and loved it so much, I bought it for two other people. The refill bottles are now impossible to find and was delighted to find them on Amazon. My only complaint is the high cost for what is really only dishwashing soap. The cost will be prohibitive in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this product I just wished that Lysol would not have stop selling it in the store. I purchased enough for 6 months but I use it so much that I need to buy more next month. I love this product.</li>
    <li> Great smell and great price.</li>
