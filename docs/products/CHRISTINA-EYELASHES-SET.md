    <li> Lashes are very cheap and they break apart when you try to pull them off to apply to your lashes</li>
    <li> This particular number of lashes were way too  crazily wispied lol but still beautiful in the package. I&#x27;ll have to trim the tips. I&#x27;m sure another number would look better on me. Regardless, the quality is beautiful. The reason I give it 5 stars though is because of the shipping!! Came over a week early! Received them in about 3 days, which I did not expect at all. This reason alone will make me a constant customer :)</li>
    <li> This brand is very flimsy. I almost broke it the first time I tried taking the glue off. And I have shiseido glue so it comes off very easily. The price is reasonable, but quality, not so much. You&#x27;re better off buying ardell.</li>
    <li> Great quality. I went to spending a little more, to finding these that were a perfect fit. Will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> These are great for the price and are super natural . I just love them ! The band is super thin and that is very important to me .</li>
    <li> Good just didn&#x27;t know the glue didn&#x27;t come with</li>
    <li> Not please with the quality. I&#x27;ve tried many brands and this one is not good by comparison. Transaction went very well but the product is not very good</li>
    <li> FELT LIKE THIS WAS A SCAM</li>
