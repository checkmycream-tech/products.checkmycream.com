<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I’ve not really gotten into the essential oils trend, but I really enjoy color changing light that this diffuser provides. The ultrasonic vapor made by the diffuser is really quite soothing and the light is bright enough to be a night light for any size room. It’s very easy to get started with this item.&lt;br /&gt;You simply twist off the top and put some water into the reservoir. Then, you plug it in and turn on the diffuser. You can turn on the colored light mode or just have the diffuser without the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review. I am a technology journalist and pride myself on providing fair and honest reviews. Please feel free to ask any questions you might have.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Excellent diffuser for smaller spaces.  Took it to work to use at my desk.  Colors are pretty as they change, or I can choose just one color.  Both continuous and intermittent settings work well.  Good product at a good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this ultrasonic aromatherapy essential oil diffuser. It works really well, has two settings. The lights are a bonus but I don&#x27;t really use them. They are really attractive though and change to many different and romantic colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device is awesome. It works just as described. Use it regularly in my bedroom. The sound is not very loud at all. I have every intention of buying another one for my living room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I have bought various brands in the past, and this one is our favorite.Easiest to clean, and the color changing lights look really nice in at night.&lt;br /&gt;Love the fact that you can put your favorite essential oils in this! Most humidifiers strongly advise against this because it will mess them up, so finding this oil diffuser is a win win for me.&lt;br /&gt;My 2 year old son really loves falling asleep to the changing lights.&lt;br /&gt;comes with:&lt;br /&gt;1 x Aroma Diffuser&lt;br /&gt;1 x Wall Charger&lt;br /&gt;1x Measuring Cup for Filling Water&lt;br /&gt;1 x User Manual&lt;br /&gt;Above all. The seller is very cooperative and does follow ups on any information regarding the product before and after purchase.I am satisfied that this is the best one for the price. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it and will get another for other rooms in my home.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:80dcbc8b639ddadb5a4deeac3fae8a32]] I love air diffusers. Any shape I do not care.&lt;br /&gt;This one is a very classy trianglish shape.&lt;br /&gt;I use them to add oils to the air.&lt;br /&gt;This changes with very pretty colors and helps your mood tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample to review.</li>
    <li> This oil diffuser is amazing. The quality of the diffuser is amazing. My husband loves the changing lights. We use it every single nights</li>
    <li> Most diffusers work the same way. They use ultrasonic vibration to transform water into cool mist. When you put essential oils into the water, they atomize into the atmosphere, creating a pleasant smell, and allowing the healing qualities of the essential oil to enter us thru our sinuses, skin, and lungs.  Basically, you select the diffuser you like, based on the shape, and operating features. The URPOWER diffuser works well, and has features that let you get more enjoyment out of the unit. For starters. you have separate buttons to control the MIST function, and the LED LIGHT. You can have mist and the LED morphing lights, or just the lights as a nightlight, or just the mist. Also, you can select to see morphing colors with the LED, or you can click on the LIGHT button, until you find your favorite color. (Some people use colored light therapy in conjunction with their aromatherapy. For example, green light to relax, matching it with Lavender oil. Red light energizes, match that with some peppermint and orange oil. Violet light is healing, match it with eucalyptus oil during a cold, etc.) With the MIST button, you can select a constant mist, or just intermittent mist, so your diffuser can last longer, between refilling the water tank. The tank holds about 120 ml of water....about a half cup of water. Most of them hold this much. It should run for about 3 hours on continuous function, then when the water tank it empty, the unit will turn off automatically. You have an indicator LED light, to let you know which mode the mist is functioning in. (Green - constant mist. Red - intermittent mist..) The URPOWER diffuser also includes a plastic water container, so you don&#x27;t have to unplug your  diffuser, and take it to the sink to fill with water.  All in all, a nice diffuser, produced by a company which has released a lot of quality products for sale on Amazon. When you buy a diffuser, you&#x27;ll get everything you need to start practicing aromatherapy, except---NO ESSENTIAL OILS INCLUDED.  I would suggest either getting one of those 6 bottle starter sets, so you have one of each of the most popular essential oils (Peppermint, Lavender, Orange, Eucalyptus, Tree Tea, and Lemon Grass), or just buy a bottle of a pre-mixed blend of essential oils, that  will have a title like Rejuvenate, or Relax.  Also, consider buying a favorite oil, so you can use your diffuser like a smokeless incense stick. I use Patchouli oil in my diffuser, or sometimes Myrrh,  Around the holidays, you can buy essential oil of Pine, so your whole house can smell like a Christmas tree or Hanukah Bush. Another idea, is to buy essential oil of Citronella, to chase away bugs from a porch. Also, Cedarwood oil is a bug repellent. Consider buying a book on Aromatherapy, if you catch the bug and want to learn more and more, about this fascinating art. Your first step, will be to purchase a diffuser to disperse your essential oils. (You can put oil on your light bulb, and let it burn into the air, but the smell is released too fast that way, plus heat destroys some of the qualities of the carefully produced Essential Oils.) If you&#x27;re looking for a good quality diffuser at a very reasonable price, you would do well with the URPOWER unit.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a free sample in exchange for a fair and honest review.ILS INCLUDED.

    <li> I have the older model of this and loved it! URPOWER brought out a new model with a nice modern design to it but they honestly could have done without the annoying branding on the front. Its an eye sore in my opinion but lets jump into the usage...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This humidifier/diffuser works really well. There are a number of different ways you can operate this diffuser: 30 seconds on/30 seconds off, or always on. The manual is difficult to understand because of the translation problems, but if you read it slowly and carefully you can figure it out for the most part. Hit the button to change from 30 seconds on/off mode to continuously on mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mist is steady and plenty. It&#x27;s amazing that a relatively small amount of water can create hours and hours of mist. I use it with essential oils (2-3 drops, as per the manual), and the mist still rises high and is NOT heavy where it falls quickly. The room fills with the scent. The reservoir is larger than other diffusers I have used recently, providing more hours of mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the LED color options. You can choose a mode where colors continuously fade from one to another or choose any individual color to keep on. Or you can turn off the LED completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this unit has an auto-shutoff, which is very helpful. The product comes with a power adapter (thankfully, it does not run off of USB, it uses a regular wall power adapter). I really like this diffuser and I definitely recommend it. I am going to try and rub the branding off using an alcohol swab. I will report back with my success or failure.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> Its beautiful just love it</li>
    <li> Very nice design. Color changes are nice. Just pop in your favorite meditation routine (either alone or guided meditation with apps like Headspace) I have lot of aromatic oil and I was wondering how to use them. They are very intense and few drops are enough. Essential oils are a natural oil typically obtained by distillation and having the characteristic fragrance of the plant or other source from which it is extracted. Essential oils are generally extracted by distillation, often by using steam. Some of essential oils are Sweet orange, Peppermint, Lemon, Eucalyptus globulus, Clove leaf. I was provided a sample of the product for reviews. (not the oils).</li>
    <li> An ultrasonic diffuser is a type of essential oil diffuser that disperses essential oils into the air. There are several different types of diffusers but this one is the very best and is easy to use. And if you are an essential oil lover, then you definitely want to own one!  This diffuser has several different colors to choose from if you turn on the light function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diffusers work by breaking down the essential oil into micro molecules then projecting them into the air to fill a room or work space.&lt;br /&gt;As the oils break down they release natural ozone and, freshen and improve the quality of the air! The particles remain in the air for several hours depending on how long the diffuser was on and how much oil was used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This diffuser uses electronic frequencies to create vibrations that are carried to the surface where oils are floating. The vibrations vaporize the oil and disperse it into the air without using any kind of heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essential oils benefits include that they can immediately penetrate the skin and cell membranes. They can actually diffuse throughout the blood and tissues instantly in a matter of seconds! Oils cross the brain-blood barrier and reach the amygdala and other limbic parts of the brain that control our mood, emotions and beliefs. So they can help us with our ability to handle stress, anger or any other emotion we are dealing with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essential oils soothe muscles and joints. They also can assist with minor aches and pains related to everyday activities especially in combination with massage. Yeah, who doesn&#x27;t like a massage?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to clean, quiet and makes the house smell great!  I received this unit at no cost to evaluate, test and review.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I took mine to the office. It sends out a refreshing mist of your favorite essential oil. When you twist and lift the outer cover, you will see a water reservoir with a clearly marked fill line. After adding the water, add about 8 drops of your favorite essential oil. Replace the cover and rotate to close and lock. Plug in, press the side switches to start the color display and vapor mist. Soft colors fade in and out from white, red, yellow, green, blue, purple, and back to white. A fill lasted me about 6 hours. Mist is released from a 3/4 inch slot in top. Unit is about 2 3/8 diameter across the top, 4 inches across the bottom, and 5 3/4 high. Comes with instruction sheet. My coworkers are already buying some. Make a nice gift, too. Something a little different.</li>
    <li> I just got this diffuser yesterday. After unboxing, I was a bit apprehensive about the quality of this diffuser. It seemed a too lightweight and flimsy to do the job. I suffer from asthma. After setting it up and plugging it in, I was blown away by its performance. Wow! As soon as I turned it on, a strong plume of steam  appeared. I diffused eucalyptus, cypress and a citrus blend. I ran it  a handful of times and didn&#x27;t need to use my inhaler once for the first time in weeks,  I&#x27;m hooked! I&#x27;m ordering one for each of my kids rooms.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:f7a8e651f15381bb406cd8b5f7d27a64]]This review is for the Essential Oil Diffuser, URPOWER Aromatherapy Diffuser and Humidifier with Timing Settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an updated version of an already-wonderful essential oil diffuser and humidifier from URPOWER. This version features a textured acrylic cover as opposed to the once smooth one this model featured. I love the texture it gives a peaceful and modern look to the device!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This diffuser is SOOO easy to use, and one of my favorite items to turn on at the start of the day and keep running with different scents until bedtime. It gets CONSTANT use in my household. The aromatherapy benefits of essential olds are extremely beneficial and something like this can really help you utilize their powerful mental and physical therapies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The URPOWER diffuser has a beautiful and highly ambient cycling color light. You can stop the cycle and leave it on a solid color - although I find I use the multicolor option so much since it is sooooooo beautiful! You can turn on the light and turn it off with the button on the left. There are many jewel tone shades and you can find a shade that matches your mood!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The automatic turn off feature is really nice for me since I am a very busy person. If you turn the diffuser mode on ... click RED for auto shut off and click GREEN for 3 hour cycle (then turn off). Sometimes before nursing school I add some drops of lavender and turn on the 3 hour and it is off by the time I get home, but leaves my house peaceful and scented to greet me when I open the front door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top just twists off of this one. In fact, this model with the textured cover is easier to twist on and off then the prior model. It is easy grip. When you want to empty the unit, just pour out the drain side. If you want to fill the unit - used the enclosed measuring cup and fill to the MAX FILL LINE. It is so simple and easy to use even a child could do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This runs on AC wall power. I hope in future versions to see a rechargeable diffuser for wireless use! This takes very low wattage. You can turn it on without the light feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 stars for functionality, design, and incredible value for such a high quality diffuser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! I received a free promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review.ns on AC wall power. I hope in future versions to see a rechargeable diffuser for wireless use!

    <li> Its pretty, works good. Little flimpsy, cheapy looking but does what it needs to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on review : diffuser doesn&#x27;t open anymore ! Gets stuck ! Can&#x27;t even operate it anymore bc of this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another update: company sent me a new one and it shuts off after the first minute ! :/</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;No noise.  Very calm and relaxing!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I was so happy to have received a sample of this diffuser for review. The operation is simple and effortless. We used some lemon essential oil and the smell freshened the room in what seemed to be no more than five minutes. I love the color changing capability of this thing! This is great for any room in your house, but it is especially good for dealing with last-minute company! Do a bit of dusting, stash a little clutter and turn this on for a wonderful subliminal message that says, \\&quot;I&#x27;ve just been cleaning all day!\\&quot; :) Gotta love it -- what an alibi!</li>
    <li> Works as described. I want to buy another one for my roommate, who also loves anything involving aroma therapy.</li>
    <li> This Essential Oil Aromatherapy Diffuser by URPOWER has become my new favorite.  First of all, it is unbelievably quiet.  Several others I have all claimed to be quiet, but this one is practically silent.  This makes for a very zen-like atmosphere and it&#x27;s much easier to fall asleep without having to hear a diffuser run in the background.  The color changing LED lights are very relaxing and the super lightweight construction makes this one of the most portable units I have owned.  I was very happy to see this came with a measuring cup, too, since it just makes everything easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very impressive how the entire unit is only about 6 inches tall, however, it puts out a great amount of fragrance for aromatherapy bliss!  It holds up to 100 milliliters of water, and since it&#x27;s ultrasonic, it only takes a couple of drops of my favorite oil to fill my entire, large bedroom with a Heavenly fragrance.  I have had over a half-dozen different items from this company, and they are always of the highest quality.  I have never been disappointed with anything from them, and I absolutely recommend URPOWER and any of their wonderful products.  I am so fortunate to have been provided a sample of this diffuser, gratis, to evaluate and keep, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.This is definitely a 5 Star product, all the way!</li>
    <li> URPOWER® Aromatherapy Diffuser and Humidifier&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a beautiful aromatherapy diffuser. You fill it with water, measuring cup included, add a few drops of your favorite scent essential oil assemble and turn it on, A/C adapter included. There are two buttons. One sets the humidified mode to run to empty or three hours and shut off. The other button starts the light show. Each button makes a beep noise when you press it so you know you did. The humidifier lights a small red or green light to show you the mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is silent in operation and the mist being from an ultrasonic machine is cool. The colors can rotate and are very pretty or you can click to your favorite color and it will stay there. Either mode, colors or diffusion can operate independently of the other or together. The power supply plug is arranged to not take more than on slot width if you are plugging into a power strip. This was a thoughtful design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested it in my large living room and the fragrance did reach all the way around the room. I was very impressed as it’s a large room combined with a dining area. Placement is important, so a central location helps with distribution of the scent. This is a wonderful addition to your home and it is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided at or nearly no cost for the purpose of evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> I bought this to disperse healing therapeutic  essential oils for medicinal reasons. It&#x27;s a cute little machine good for a small bedroom  or kitchen or bathroom. I&#x27;m going to have to buy a larger capacity model I have cathedral ceilings. However this model dispersed the therapeutic lavender oil and about 45 minutes later I was falling into a deep sleep at 4 pm in the afternoon. I could hardly wake myself back up. I wanted a soothing relaxing  healing oil  and the diffuser did its job and so did the essential oil. Oh my gosh stress was  completely gone.  I should have bought a diffuser long ago.  I see now how this can be a wonderful addition to your health regime. I know now what  some relatives will get for Christmas !!!!!!</li>
    <li> Everything was packaged great. I love it!!!!</li>
