### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;Either way, it still did a great job!</li>
      <li>I tried Unred with a home root touchup, using 5 drops per 0.5 oz of L&#x27;Oreal Preference Medium Ash Brown - worked great!</li>
      <li>great service and value!</li>
      <li>The shipper was awesome received it in a timely manner!</li>
      <li>This has to be a consumer&#x27;s best buy.    </li>
      <li>Adding drops of it to hairdye is the best way to do it, for me anyway.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t very happy with how it looked on me and since then have tried to change it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really impressed that a cheaper product like this can get me close to the hair color</li>
      <li>Great stuff!!!</li>
      <li>It was awesome.</li>
      <li>My wife told me about the product and that this was a very good price.</li>
      <li>It works great.  </li>
      <li>She has used it once and is happy with the results</li>
      <li>This is a great product I have used it 2 times and already see a difference.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m extremely happy with this product..</li>
      <li>Thankfully there is a great product to fix this problem.</li>
      <li>With all of the money we saved I bought her some very nice jewelry.</li>
      <li>Ive tried everything to get a successful use out of this and never can.</li>
      <li>Definitely a good product.</li>
      <li>Good Price.  </li>
      <li>Really good one,if you don&#x27;t want to have a redness on your hair,just buy it and get some glamorous look.</li>
      <li>I have heard good things.</li>
      <li>Good Product.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m really happy :)    </li>
      <li>but she is very satisfied with the product and has used it for years.</li>
      <li>Carrot top!</li>
      <li>it is amazing the difference</li>
      <li>Now my wife gets lots of accolades from her friends and family on how nice her hair looks.</li>
      <li>when I found this on here I was thrilled..</li>
      <li>I believe this product is meant to be used with any color dye to keep it from pulling too warm.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and it works like magic!</li>
      <li>It does lift off most of my reds and golden hues, but I can still see some reds under the sun or very bright light.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>sure how this would work for blondes though.</li>
      <li>So if you are not getting results try mixing in more to your dye or conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>more</li>
      <li>This product was a great find for me - a real problem solver.</li>
      <li>I am glad I din&#x27;t mix it with the hair dye as I think it would have been darker than I want still in the summer months.</li>
      <li>Not too sure about this product.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I tried it again, this time putting about twice as many drops in... still</li>
      <li>/&gt;It did a fantastic job!</li>
      <li>Will use once more &amp;</li>
      <li>This is my much more convenient.  </li>
      <li>then it will take some time and more than one treatment.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tested in by mixing it in my hair dye, and the results were pretty good.</li>
      <li>I have medium ash blond hair (8.5-9), natural color light brown, tried over the counter Clairol Perfect 10 light blond, turned my ash blond hair orange-red.  </li>
      <li>I used this product with a Hi-Lift Light Golden Brown color which I have used and loved before.</li>
      <li>It was easy to use, though.</li>
      <li>I color my hair light ash brown (I&#x27;m naturally light brown, with about 30% gray), and I use a highlighting kit on top of that.  </li>
      <li>Easily.</li>
      <li>Orange tones return to my hair very quickly.</li>
      <li>So I appreciated when the sales girl nicely and respectfully suggested the packet of UNRED.</li>
      <li>First, I mix Mrs. Stewart&#x27;s Bluing with my favorite conditioner to make my own special anti-orange conditioner (I make my conditioner about the color of a blueberry).  </li>
      <li>I had gone over blond highlights with a light neutral brown.</li>
      <li>I bought a light 6A ash brown and planned to add the UNRED to it.</li>
      <li>think they sell a bigger bottle too, don&#x27;t quote me lol</li>
      <li>ok first of all, i didn&#x27;t buy it on amazon.</li>
      <li>First off buy a better brand.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just glad I tried a sample first.</li>
      <li>UnRed is my first line of defense, but on top of that, Mrs. Stewart&#x27;s Bluing is my life-saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it will, great product, lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>This stuff is pure magic.  </li>
      <li>Good for keeping those red tones out of your hair.</li>
      <li>I used Madison Reed Sienna Brown (Taupe brown w/ cool tones).</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was putting way too much, but it didn&#x27;t end up doing anything.  </li>
      <li>so my hair was a cool platinum in the lightest areas and a honey in the darker areas.</li>
      <li>I have naturally chestnut/black hair, and I dyed it to a platinum blond on my own.</li>
      <li>Cant really say any more about it than that.</li>
      <li>If I dye my hair again in the future I will plan to use more Unred to see if I get better results.</li>
      <li>thank you very much Un-red!</li>
      <li>and they are a much more normal shade.</li>
      <li>Nice and Easy has worked better for me in the past.  </li>
      <li>This stuff REALLY works!!</li>
      <li>and I end up with a lovely natural sunny shade.</li>
      <li>Great stuff  got most of the  brass red tone out after dying my hair from blond to dark brown.</li>
      <li>Right away I could tell that it was not going to look the shade I had imagined in my head.</li>
      <li>I have had my hair a bright, bright red for a few months now and when I bleached my hair again, to attempt to get it white, it was light pink/light orange in places.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There was no brassiness when I went from brown to blonde, and I was able to do the die job myself without going to the salon.</li>
      <li>So I will have to keep an eye out for sale prices on bigger bottles! :)</li>
      <li>a darker red hers more lighter than mine</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had success just adding UnRed to my shampoo or conditioner, or even applying it straight to my hair.  </li>
      <li>Unred really works!</li>
      <li>Without adding UnRed to my mixtures, my hair always ends up pretty orange.  </li>
      <li>My goal was to take my brown hair with reddish undertones to a more ash shade of the same level brown.</li>
      <li>When I saw this product and the reviews I was hopeful I would be able to remove the red from my hair.</li>
      <li>BUT OMG it is the first time in 20 years</li>
      <li>It turned my hair darker and MORE red, 2 things I dislike.</li>
      <li>I first tried this product by mixing it with conditioner.  </li>
      <li>for now..this stuff is a very cheap and great answer if you mess up your hair or need to tone down orange/red tones.</li>
      <li>Other people may have better success depending on their hair though, of course.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The first time I didnt notice any changes really, mayeb</li>
      <li>My hair turned out kinda black/dark brown (when the hair dye was light brown) and has red hues too.</li>
      <li>Perhaps on a blonde it would work, but on a darker-haired girl, I need the more powerful chemical processes created by the hair color kits to actually have the UrRed take</li>
      <li>and it did not have any odor, but it seemed very ineffective on my hair.  </li>
      <li>This did absolutely nothing, brassy tones are not reduced at all.</li>
      <li>I really regret using this.</li>
      <li>, the real reason I&#x27;m writing this review is to share about Mrs. Stewart&#x27;s Bluing (which I also get on Amazon).  </li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t really work for me</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Total crap... My hair had a reddish tint to it... now it has a purple tint to it. thank you very much Un-red!</li>
    <li> Really good one,if you don&#x27;t want to have a redness on your hair,just buy it and get some glamorous look.</li>
    <li> It did not work when i used it. I tried it with conditioner and with the developer and neither did anything for my brassy hair :(</li>
    <li> I dye my own hair and occasionally get a red tinge after a few washings.  This was highly rated and I tried it.  I did not notice any difference.  It did not damage my hair in anyway and it did not have any odor, but it seemed very ineffective on my hair.  My hair is extremely coarse and there is a possibility I should have added more product; however after 2 tries I gave up on Unred.</li>
    <li> Absolutely no difference for me. I dyed my hair a few weeks ago and it turned out with lots of brassy tones. I have now used this 3 times! 1 5min, 2 10min, 3 30min! Nothing, nothing, nothing. I am so upset, and my hair is still brassy!!!</li>
    <li> Unred really works! It takes away the awful brassy tones and leaves a lovely color. It didn&#x27;t take all the red out of my hair, but it certainly left my hair looking much healthier than it was. Adding drops of it to hairdye is the best way to do it, for me anyway.</li>
    <li> It helps tone down red, but it does not completely eliminate it. I have dark ash-blonde hair and after seeing my first grey a few months back, I made the slight mistake of using a box dye on my whole head. Unfortunately the dye put red tones in my hair, which means that even though I have not seen a grey since I am still dying my hair every 6 weeks because the roots don&#x27;t match. Adding this stuff to my boxed dye did minimize the red tones quite a bit. My roots are not a perfect match, but the red is subtle enough that I think I might be able to stop dying it and test my luck as it grows out (crossing my fingers for no more grey hairs!). Be warned that it looks REALLY scary when you put the dye in after this is added; the dye looks black and super wet. I was so afraid my hair was going to be black but it rinsed out to be pretty close to my natural color. If I dye my hair again in the future I will plan to use more Unred to see if I get better results.</li>
    <li> This really does take the red out of your hair color. Two or three drops is all you need.  I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> My brown hair has a red cast to it that I try to tone down when I color it. I try to use &amp;#34;ash&amp;#34; shades, but often the color looks flat. I had high hopes for this, but all it did for me was darken the shade overall. I used Madison Reed Sienna Brown (Taupe brown w/ cool tones). The red/brassy tones still came through. I wish I hadn&#x27;t used it. It would&#x27;ve looked more natural as a lighter shade if the red was going to be there anyway. It was easy to use, though. The product is thick and it was easy to add the correct number of drops. It looked like black ink. The bottle is white, so it&#x27;s had to tell how much is in it, but it feels like it has enough for multiple uses. It states to use 10 drops per ounce of color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get the red hair dye out of my hair for weeks and was hoping this product would do it. It seemed to work well for other reviewers but didn&#x27;t produce the effect I wanted. After using the entire bottle over a period of a couple weeks, it did tone down the red somewhat, just not as much as I wanted.</li>
    <li> I used this product with a Hi-Lift Light Golden Brown color which I have used and loved before. It turned my hair darker and MORE red, 2 things I dislike. Now to decide whether to let my hairstylist try to correct it, or live with it for 4 or so weeks. I really regret using this.</li>
    <li> I am a natural medium brown. I few months ago I went red (request by the husband). I wasn&#x27;t very happy with how it looked on me and since then have tried to change it. Light Brown hair dye just made the red redder. When I saw this product and the reviews I was hopeful I would be able to remove the red from my hair. I first tried the conditioner recipe one customer wrote about that - it didn&#x27;t work, actually increased the red tones in my hair. Next I tried as the product states to mix with the hair dye. It did reduce some of the red but it isn&#x27;t working for me. My hair turned out kinda black/dark brown (when the hair dye was light brown) and has red hues too. Hopefully over time this red in my hair will go away.This product may have worked for some others, but it is not for everyone.</li>
    <li> It prevents trashy brassy tone color hair.</li>
    <li> This product was a great find for me - a real problem solver. I have strawberry blond hair and using even the ashiest blonde hair color alone will leave me with orangey hair. I use 15 drops of Unred and I end up with a lovely natural sunny shade. Lasts a long time and well worth the price.  Be forewarned, it will turn the hair color solution dark grey/black so it&#x27;s a little scary.</li>
    <li> This is a great product I have used it 2 times and already see a difference. It really does take the red out.I been dying my hair red for the past 8 years. Recently decided that I want to go similar to my natural color so I stripped the color out with vitamin c. Then I decided I would try this product. It works great.  The shipper was awesome received it in a timely manner!</li>
    <li> My wife has saved several thousands of dollars dying her own hair to blonde without going to a professional hair stylist. The only problem was that some read highlights would always appear. Ardell Unred saved the day by toning down the red tint. Now my wife gets lots of accolades from her friends and family on how nice her hair looks. With all of the money we saved I bought her some very nice jewelry.</li>
    <li> I have medium to light brown hair naturally, but have been dyeing it at home for several years. I usually use a dark ash blonde shade, and my hair usually ends up a golden blonde with lots of red/orange tones. I decided to try L&#x27;Oreal Preference 8 1/2A Champagne Blonde and use the Ardell. It turned the dye a dark purple/black like the other reviews mentioned, and I only used 5 drops, which is much less than they say to use. I could tell a difference as soon as my hair dried- my hair was lighter than I&#x27;ve ever been able to take it, but instead of seeing more orange or red, I saw much less- I look closer to a blonde instead of a strawberry blonde. I have also mixed some into my conditioner and used it that way. Next time, I&#x27;ll be adding the recommended amount to the hair dye. I&#x27;m really impressed that a cheaper product like this can get me close to the hair color I&#x27;ve been wanting for years.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions just as they were written. The hair color I mixed it with was a liquid and when unred was added, it turned into a black goo.  A lot of the red in my hair did come out.... but I&#x27;m not sure which is to blame for my color turning out darker than intended, the hair color or the unred. I was going for a dark blonde and ended up with more of a brown.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years &amp; recently the company&lt;br /&gt;changed the way they sell it at our local supplier.&lt;br /&gt;So when I found this on here I was thrilled..&lt;br /&gt;The item came as pictured &amp; the delivery was through&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;prime\\&quot; so it was here in 2 days.</li>
    <li> My hair turns very red. Easily. I will always use this stuff!</li>
    <li> I tried it a capable of times following the directions closely.  This didn&#x27;t help me get rid of the red.  It darkened the dye way too much and negatively affected the final color of my hair dye.</li>
    <li> I tried Satin Hair color (ash blonde) and it turned my hair a brassy/gold blonde.  This Unred fixed it, you can use it mixed with water, and I&#x27;ve also put it in shampoo and conditioner.  Thankfully there is a great product to fix this problem.</li>
    <li> I used to buy single use of this product at Sally&#x27;s.  This is my much more convenient.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> If you want a real ash color to your blond, this is the product for you. It suppresses red tones, and can be added to shampoo to keep red tones out.  Does what it says it will, great product, lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I use to buy this in Sally&#x27;s but they are not carrying it in my store. I use this whenever I do my hair or it would be really red. I usually use 20-30 drops.</li>
    <li> I used Loreal Dark Golden Brown which I&#x27;ve went dark before but not with Loreal.  First off buy a better brand.  Nice and Easy has worked better for me in the past.  Dyed my hair 4 days ago along with my daughters hair which was a dirty blonde.  Both of us had the same problem it went a darker red hers more lighter than mine but mine was dark brown with dark red hightlights and more light red at the roots.  I was not happy.  I did a lot of research yesterday with the Ardell Unred and Ardell Red Gold Correcter Plus trying to see the difference and maybe what it would do for me.  I said why not and went to the local Sallys Beauty Supply and bought both products.  (You can&#x27;t get the .25 bottle of unred at Sallys just the packets).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So last night I added 1 packet of unred to about 2 ounces of my conditioner for color treated hair after I shampooed hair so my hair was pretty wet when i applied.  I let it set 30 minutes and then rinsed it out.  Although my hair was still wet when I went to bed it didn&#x27;t look much different.  This morning I woke up and decided to try the Ardell Red Gold Correcter Plus.  I used a 3 minute deep conditioner (3oz or so) with about 30 drops of the correcter and I put it on my DRY hair with just a touch of water to get it smoothed through. I let it set 30 minutes, rinsed it out, dryed it and straightened it.  AND I CAN tell a difference.  It looks less red and less brassy and more ashy.  I think if your using this stuff (either one) as a correcter instead of adding it to your dye then it will take some time and more than one treatment.  I am thinking that the red gold corrector worked a little better but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try both.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference when bleaching my hair, maybe I didn&#x27;t add enough or I added too much but I put a little more then the bottle said</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work.  My roots are as orange as ever. I used Ash Blonde.  I put 40 drops in a box of hair color.  It said 10 drops per ounce and it was total 4 ounces.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was putting way too much, but it didn&#x27;t end up doing anything.  Disappointing.  I think I&#x27;m going to try Wella toner.  I have heard good things.</li>
    <li> Where to even begin.... I&#x27;ve attempted using this product multiple times and have yet to experience any positive results. I have tried using it in conditioner, developer, bleach, and multiple hair dyes to no avail. The first few times I tried to use this, i brushed it off due to the fact that my hair was an unnatural bright mahogany color(notorious for being difficult to remove) however, even when used on a faded warm brown color, it still did not work. Ive tried everything to get a successful use out of this and never can.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it works like magic! :) It completely avoids and/or removes orangish/red tint to dark colored hair when lifting or bleaching! I was truly amazed. I first tried it out with the individual packets and wanted to keep it in stock with all my other hair care/maintenance products, I just didn&#x27;t realize how little 0.25 ounces really is until I received this product! it&#x27;s tiny! So I will have to keep an eye out for sale prices on bigger bottles! :)</li>
    <li> OK so by drops they mean globs because it is thick. I was expecting drip drip drip. No big. BUT OMG it is the first time in 20 years my hair did not turn red/brassy. It was awesome. I actually followed someone else&#x27;s advice to also get the old lady(man?) blue stuff...I forget the name, but I did not need it. I am a drug store box user and hope to graduate to Sally&#x27;s next time, but it really worked. I was going darker and did use and brown with ash, but I have gone every direction before and always had some red/brassy. Definitely a good product.</li>
    <li> Only has a few customers who use/need this product but she is very satisfied with the product and has used it for years.</li>
    <li> This product works very well.  There was no brassiness when I went from brown to blonde, and I was able to do the die job myself without going to the salon.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  It takes the red out of my hair as I&#x27;m bleaching it blond and I use professional hair color with gold base and the correct peroxide too.  Before this product, no matter what I did my hair had a reddish look to it.  I&#x27;m so grateful to the person who turned me on to this product.  One bottle lasts me up to 6 hair colors, even though you have to use 10 drops per ounce of hair color.  Good Price.  Good Product.</li>
    <li> I have ongoing issues with my hair fading to a flat unflattering red. I had gone over blond highlights with a light neutral brown. Right away I could tell that it was not going to look the shade I had imagined in my head. Does it ever! I just dealt with it for about 3 weeks as it did not look hideous. But today I thought I would go to Sally&#x27;s and see what I could do. I work in the salon industry so I&#x27;m not totally unaware of color and how it works. So I appreciated when the sales girl nicely and respectfully suggested the packet of UNRED. I bought a light 6A ash brown and planned to add the UNRED to it. But at the last minute I decided to just mix it with my conditioner and leave for 45 min with a plastic bag wrapped tightly around my head. The color of the UNRED is black, but if you look closer it&#x27;s actually a violet color. Violet is the color that counteracts the red. When I washed it out I could still see gold tones in my hair so I thought it didn&#x27;t work. But then as it dried I began to see that golden tones in my hair were very pretty and natural looking vs. the drab orange look before. I am glad I din&#x27;t mix it with the hair dye as I think it would have been darker than I want still in the summer months. But as fall comes around I do think I will add it to color. As a bonus: my hair feels very soft which is rare given that I have course, thick wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Finally, a product that works !    Have tried many expensive de-red products over the years, all a waste of money.  This has to be a consumer&#x27;s best buy.    Mix with your color and process for 25-30 min.  I have medium ash blond hair (8.5-9), natural color light brown, tried over the counter Clairol Perfect 10 light blond, turned my ash blond hair orange-red.  What a mess.  Didn&#x27;t want to completely strip back to pale yellow and re-dye a medium ash blond, hair can only take so much, so tried this. The prelim test I tried for 30 min., gave the exact color minus the orange red.  Did the rest of my hair, tried 40 min., which was a bit too long ... took the color about 1/2 a shade darker ... which actually was a color I&#x27;ve been trying to get for years so I&#x27;m really happy :)    Would never dye or bleach without this product again !</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to help anything. Used in my hair dye shampoo and conditioner an didn&#x27;t notice a difference. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my $ just buy a toner or toning shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have had my hair a bright, bright red for a few months now and when I bleached my hair again, to attempt to get it white, it was light pink/light orange in places. I typically do not have an issue bleaching to white, but this red was just refusing to come out. I bleached a few times over a few weeks, with purple and blue toner, and it just wasn&#x27;t coming out. So, this time bleaching, I decided to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did a fantastic job! Some warnings though:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes out a very, very dark purple, almost black. If you leave it in with your bleach (like it says) and leave the bleach in for a longer period (I did 45 mins) it will end up dying your white hair a bit. My hair came out silvery purple. I actually think it&#x27;s really pretty, but others might not! So, if you want to use it to tone, keep it in for only like 15-20 mins at a time if you dont want it to deposit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, it still did a great job!</li>
    <li> This did absolutely nothing, brassy tones are not reduced at all. Cant really say any more about it than that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ardell UnRed with my box dyes and box highlighting kits for several years.  I color my hair light ash brown (I&#x27;m naturally light brown, with about 30% gray), and I use a highlighting kit on top of that.  Without adding UnRed to my mixtures, my hair always ends up pretty orange.  I&#x27;ve never had success just adding UnRed to my shampoo or conditioner, or even applying it straight to my hair.  That&#x27;s never worked for me.  Perhaps on a blonde it would work, but on a darker-haired girl, I need the more powerful chemical processes created by the hair color kits to actually have the UrRed take effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the real reason I&#x27;m writing this review is to share about Mrs. Stewart&#x27;s Bluing (which I also get on Amazon).  It&#x27;s the same stuff elderly women have used in the past to rinse their white hair in to keep it from looking dull or discolored.  I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s where the term \\&quot;blue hair\\&quot; (used to describe elderly ladies) came from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you know anything about the color wheel, blue is the opposite of orange, so by rinsing orange-tinged hair in blue water (made by mixing Mrs. Stewart&#x27;s Bluing in water), any remaining orange that&#x27;s not taken care of by the UnRed is really neutralized.  As anyone who colors hair lighter shades of brown knows, the orange is REALLY hard to prevent.  UnRed is my first line of defense, but on top of that, Mrs. Stewart&#x27;s Bluing is my life-saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two ways I use it.  First, I mix Mrs. Stewart&#x27;s Bluing with my favorite conditioner to make my own special anti-orange conditioner (I make my conditioner about the color of a blueberry).  And second, I fill my bathroom sink with water and add the Bluing, and after each shower and I do a final rinse of my hair in that blue water.  It doesn&#x27;t take out 100% of the orange, but it helps A LOT.  I do have to be careful, as there have been a couple times that I&#x27;ve made my water a little TOO blue and my hair has ended up a tad greenish-gray.  It&#x27;s not abig deal though, as it comes out at the next shampoo - just give your hair an extra rub between your palms to help get the unwanted blue out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll definitely need to experiment with how much Bluing to put in the rinse water.  I would recommend starting out by making your water at least the color of the blue hospital signs you see on the road, and go from there.  Sometimes I make my water a very deep dark blue.  The lighter, and the more damaged your hair, probably the less blue you&#x27;ll need.  I&#x27;m not very scientific about it.  I just give the bottle one or two big squeezes into the sink of water.  Oh, and be sure to use an old (or dark) towel to dry your hair, as the rinse water will leave temporary blue stains on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone the way it has helped me!</li>
    <li> ok first of all, i didn&#x27;t buy it on amazon. i messed up my hair at home - i have very bright blonde (professionally highlighted hair) and my roots are a boring mousy brown...i tried to lighten my roots a few shades so that i could extend the time between expensive salon trips. well the result was AWFUL orange-y/reddish roots!! it looked like my roots were glowing orange while the rest of my hair was a very pretty natural blonde. so came online and found this unred stuff and thought...\\&quot;i can&#x27;t wait a few days to get this in the mail, i need it NOW!\\&quot; so i went to sally beauty supply. sadly they didn&#x27;t have a bottle like amazon does...they just sold the little one time use packets. so i bought a few. here&#x27;s the part that my review may differ from others. i know you&#x27;re supposed to mix it with your hair color but since i already screwed up my color i didn&#x27;t have that option. so i took a very thick conditioner i have and put some in a bowl and mixed it with the unred. i used a highlighting brush and applied it to my roots. ((heads up...this stuff is full on black when you apply it to your hair...terrifying but normal)) i left the conditioner/unred mixture on for about 40 minutes and then rinsed. my roots are NOT glowing anymore and they are a much more normal shade. i&#x27;m extremely happy with this product..and i think in a week or so...i&#x27;ll do it again. it is amazing the difference and i didn&#x27;t even use it with hair color like they recommend. next time around when i do my roots between salon trips i&#x27;ll add the unred and come back and update my review. for now..this stuff is a very cheap and great answer if you mess up your hair or need to tone down orange/red tones. :)</li>
    <li> It took 90% of the red in the bleached hair, but not the color of the toner that my hair stylist applied over the bleached hair.</li>
    <li> Not too sure about this product. The first time I didnt notice any changes really, mayeb cuzz I didnt use enough so the next time I had used ALOT, I did notice slight changes but nothing dramatic.</li>
    <li> I first tried this product by mixing it with conditioner.  I started with four drops, and finally used five, but it never corrected the terrible red in my hair.  I then tried it with haircolor and it actually made my hair look worse all over with more red highlights.  Maybe I need more tips from someone, but for now it&#x27;s a total failure for me.</li>
    <li> I tried this the other day when I dyed my hair and I didn&#x27;t notice any less red in my hair afterwards. My goal was to take my brown hair with reddish undertones to a more ash shade of the same level brown. I followed the directions and used 10 drops per ounce of hair color and it didn&#x27;t do anything. I used ash based dye as well. Too bad.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t really work for me but I think that is because I didn&#x27;t understand how to use or what it&#x27;s supposed to help with.  I do wish it had clearer instructions.  Basically I was using it because I was going from dyed red hair to blonde.  I bleached my hair to a sort of orange and tried to use this with permanent dye to cover the orange up.  But that&#x27;s not how this product works.  I believe this product is meant to be used with any color dye to keep it from pulling too warm.  That seems to be a problem for some people when using golden based dyes or even ash dyes, so this product makes the ash (green) more prominent.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, just in case anyone might be reading this and might make the same mistake I did, what you really should do to go blonde is bleach your hair at least to a yellow color and then dye with a semi-perm blonde (you don&#x27;t need to put yourself through the damage of a perm color if you&#x27;re just going darker because you don&#x27;t need the lift), unless you&#x27;re going platinum in which case you will bleach to a pale yellow and then use a toner.</li>
    <li> Good for keeping those red tones out of your hair. You can use this in your hair dye or your shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. I tried the suggested amount of drops and the result was the normal brassy look. I tried it again, this time putting about twice as many drops in... still no effect. I put almost the rest of it in the third time with my final bleach, and it was as brassy as ever. I would not suggest this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have naturally dark ash blonde hair that always seems to turn out orangy/golden when I dye it light ash colors. I was really hopeful that this would product would help produce different results with my last home coloring efforts, but sadly it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> It does get the red out... After bleaching 3 years of black out my naturally blonde hair I&#x27;ve been left with unsightly, returning orange/red tones. My hair is damaged enough so I limit my use of dyes/toners (until my hair has grown out)... I actually mix about 30 drops into deep conditioner (not the bottle just what I intend on using at that time) and slather it into my hair and let it sit for as long as I can (since my hair is damaged lol) Seems to do the trick. For my hair though, the results do not last long... Orange tones return to my hair very quickly. Other people may have better success depending on their hair though, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did take me a few times to learn how much to use... I wasn&#x27;t using enough initially. So if you are not getting results try mixing in more to your dye or conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think they sell a bigger bottle too, don&#x27;t quote me lol</li>
    <li> This product initially fixed the problem of my hair &#x27;pulling red&#x27; on hair coloring. Every time I&#x27;ve gone to the salon for brown coloring they have to add max blue-green to dye prevent the red cast. I tried Unred with a home root touchup, using 5 drops per 0.5 oz of L&#x27;Oreal Preference Medium Ash Brown - worked great! Without the Unred addtive, this supposedly &#x27;ash&#x27; color still pulls red. The product insert claims it works with bleach if you&#x27;re lightening your hair, but I&#x27;ve only tried ash brown (my natural color). I used the recommended solution strength (10 drops per 1 oz. color). This additive is deep violet (blue + red), so the initial correction will fade over time leaving some red.</li>
    <li> This stuff REALLY works!! I hate when my hair gets brassy with reddish tones (as it often does cause I color it) even when I have used products that claim to take the brassiness out. Just a few drops of this stuff and I could see immediate results even when I just put it in my shampoo! When put it my hair coloring product, it took nearly all the red out! Will use once more &amp; the red should all be gone! Great stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff  got most of the  brass red tone out after dying my hair from blond to dark brown. Had to use with conditioner and let it set it for 10min. With three drops.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this at all. I could not find any directions in the size 7 font print, so I took a guess. It was a disaster! I even tried looking online for directions, and couldn&#x27;t find any. I&#x27;m just glad I tried a sample first.</li>
    <li> great service and value!</li>
    <li> This stuff is pure magic.  Whenever I need to beach my brown/red hair... it&#x27;s KEY to a god color.</li>
    <li> maybe I expected too much, but even putting it on right on my orange hair, leaving it on, mixing it into shampoo or hair color, the discoloration did not leave my hair. Carrot top!</li>
    <li> My wife told me about the product and that this was a very good price. She has used it once and is happy with the results</li>
    <li> It did eliminate the red in my hair but unfortunately it did leave it a little darker than it would normally be. I will still be using it again. I would rather go a little darker than a little redder.</li>
    <li> Did not work on my hair at all. Was very disappointed and would not recommend this product. I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Only product that works for me.</li>
    <li> It works just as advertised.</li>
    <li> I used this today and my hair is back to normal!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go to the salon and get my hair to a medium brown with dark blonde ombre. I had a 3RV on my hair previously. After stripping, I ultimately ended up looking like a lion :( Deep red undertones throughout the brown and it made its way into the blonde. My hair looked unbelievably brassy even after double processing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After crying my eyes out, I took it upon myself to darken my hair myself (2 days later) after 275 dollars got thrown down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up going in with 2 bottles of Wella ColorCharm 4N &amp; 4A mixed with .5 ounces of UnRed and .5 ounces of Wella ColorCharm in Cool Violet. One warning though, Unred turns the dye completely black but rinses out fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product completely removed the ugly, harsh red undertone in my hair -  My lifesaver. I would recommend this to everyone and anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how this would work for blondes though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tested in by mixing it in my hair dye, and the results were pretty good. It does lift off most of my reds and golden hues, but I can still see some reds under the sun or very bright light.</li>
    <li> Worked like a freaking charm. I have naturally chestnut/black hair, and I dyed it to a platinum blond on my own. I had some remnants of a red ombre I had done the year prior, so when I lightened it, there were a few strands that had a peachy pink tone to them. I used this product one time and never needed it again. It removed all the pink so my hair was a cool platinum in the lightest areas and a honey in the darker areas. Exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my pics, the four-pic one is with the peachy tone (before UnRed) and the one of me alone is after, peach tones gone.</li>
