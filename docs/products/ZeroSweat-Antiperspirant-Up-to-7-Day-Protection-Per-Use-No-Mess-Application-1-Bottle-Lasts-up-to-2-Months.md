      <li>It mostly goes away, but every now</li>
      <li>Hence, this is why I experienced so much burning.</li>

      <li>After searching for an alternative to prescription strength antiperspirants, I stumbled up this item, ordered it, and a month later think it is the best item out there.  </li>
      <li>However, after using this, I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;pit-out.&amp;#34; I recommend for anyone that needs protection better than even prescription deodorants.  </li>
      <li>I can forget to use it for 4 or 5 days now and still not sweat AT ALL from my underarms unless I&#x27;m actually working out, which is perfect.</li>
      <li>My case is probably more severe compared to others, so it might work for someone else...</li>
      <li>Love love it.</li>
      <li>Zero sweat works better than anything else i have ever used.</li>
      <li>I have tried many many “clinical strength” deodorants and none of them seem to do what they claim.  </li>

      <li>Good Luck ;-)</li>
      <li>But it is sooo worth it to not stink anymore!!</li>
      <li>Not the best, and it does not keep you dry up to 7 days!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so much more comfortable.</li>
      <li>Incredible that it actually works!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Been using over a week and still no results. Definitely not a 100% guarantee.</li>
    <li> Zero sweat works better than anything else i have ever used. I normally sweat like a faucet. It does not always keep me completely dry like it claims, but i can live with a little sweat. I already purchased another.............6 months later, still working better than anything else i have ever used. Not perfect, but close.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my son after he called me from school to tell me he researched excessive sweating and wanted to have surgery to remove his sweat glands.  I was surprised he was willing to go to such an extreme.  I asked him to give me some time to find a less invasive solution.  We found ZeroSweat. It took about a week to ten days before he saw results. He had very little irritation and we are very pleased with the product. I have recommended it to some other moms who&#x27;s children are having the same issues.  Thanks for developing this product! I had no idea how much my son&#x27;s sweating was bothering him.</li>
    <li> Honestly, this stuff actually works! It has saved my life and gave me so much confidence! Thanks so much!!!</li>
    <li> Tyler how should I use it I just received it today and I&#x27;m so happy I haven&#x27;t made home from work but I need to no the proper way.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a magical deo</li>
    <li> This did absolutely nothing. In fact, I sweat more with this than I do with a regular secret deodorant. And the bottle leaks everytime you use roller.</li>
    <li> This product WILL keep you from sweating! It says up to three days, but I usually don&#x27;t sweat for about 6 days, and without it I sweat constantly. I don&#x27;t know if it happens for everyone, but this leaves my armpits extremely irritated! They itch really bad for about three days after applying this. But for me, the itching is worth not sweating through all of my shirts.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! It help me since The first week I used it!</li>
    <li> I have seen a definite reduction in sweating since using this product. I like it, and am especially pleased that--despite the significant percentage of aluminum chloride--this product caused no rash. I live in a hot, humid climate, and I&#x27;m not sure anything could completely stop excessive perspiration here. But this comes darn close. Thanks to the makers of ZeroSweat.</li>
    <li> This product is beyond expectations.  I have struggled with finding a good deodorant/antiperspirant for YEARS.  Simply nothing had worked.  I would apply several times a day..I would still have armpit odor and my clothes would be ruined.  This stuff has been fantastic.  Apply before bed time every other or every 3rd night.  NO more odor!  Make sure you read the instructions though!  They are not playin&#x27; when they say do not apply after showers or shaving!!!  You will know it if you do!  It does make your armpits slightly itchy after applying.  But it is sooo worth it to not stink anymore!!</li>
    <li> I have always had problems with excessive underarm sweating. This is the real deal. I actually only use it about twice a week and it is completely manageable. Nothing worse than sweat stains on your shirt at 1100, or bringing multiple extra shirts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not so sure yet how well this works. I am still trying it out. It&#x27;s a surprisingly thin liquid. I will check in and update my review after a few weeks use.</li>
    <li> This has really helped me control underarm sweat. I was very skeptical, but it works better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this product again when I run out!</li>
    <li> Got it for my teenage daughter, who has tried everything.  This unfortunately didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet. But was delivered quickly and exactly what I expected! Look forward to trying the product! Thanks!</li>
    <li> After trying many products over the years, this is the one that works the best.  Lasts for several days.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately. I ended up having to get botox shots instead.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped. I was purchasing hydrosol, which was pricey and I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore so I bought this as a backup. I prefer the hydrosol.</li>
    <li> This stuff really does work, I was pretty surprised. I have been suffering from hyperhidrosis my whole life and I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to work so well. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far and over the past two days I&#x27;ve had almost no wetness. Definitely worth trying!</li>
    <li> Working so far and we are in a heat wave!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!!!  After the first use, it reduced my sweat by 90%..  I couldnt believe..  I didnt have much problem with itching..  This is a life saver!!!  So glad ai found it..</li>
    <li> This product is outstanding! I have tried many similar products to no avail. I can go for days without a hint of smell or sweat. Thank you again for this gift from above.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist diagnosed me with hyperhydrosis (excessive sweating) a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Tried this product and does not work for me at all. I gave it plenty of time to work (a few weeks). My case is probably more severe compared to others, so it might work for someone else...</li>
    <li> Works amazingly well...  a terrific product that does what it promises!  Will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, life changing</li>
    <li> I opened the bottle just after receiving it and liquid immediately spilled all over my legs and bed. Not sure if this is bad packaging or an issue with the roller ball. Disappointed to already have lost a bunch of the product I paid for without having been able to use it.</li>
    <li> Works great. Still sweat a tiny bit which is expected but I no longer have to change my shirt  at work. This product was way more effective then regular anti persperant.  Without this I would have had to get something perscription.</li>
    <li> I used to buy Certain Dri until they recently changed their formula and it stopped working. Zero Sweat is like the old Certain Dri, although much more expensive, but I&#x27;ll pay it to be dry and not smelly.</li>
    <li> It was actually good even thoe at first didnt work but then i started using it again it worked for me i still sweat but not as much as before which im usually happy cuz the product does work</li>
    <li> My forehead use to sweat like crazy and I apply this every other night oh my forehead and my forehead doesn&#x27;t sweat hard anymore</li>
    <li> As female after getting laser hair removal it caused my sweat glands to absolutely freak out the last few years.  I&#x27;d tried every sort of &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; antiperspirant/deodorant with no effect.  I noticed a difference with this product after 2 days.  There is a little bit of irritation and itching for me and I think I&#x27;m going to see about using a moisturizing deodorant in conjunction with this product.  However I am willing to accept a little itching to not sweat through blouses, dresses, and work cloths.</li>
    <li> Thanks to zero sweat this product changed my life.I try it all nothing I use seem to work but now I can glady say  no more sweat stains I feel more confident I dont have to wear only dark clothes .thanks a million.</li>
    <li> This is the first product that has worked for our teen. It took a couple of weeks using it almost daily but they have finally seen a big difference and now don&#x27;t need to use it every day. It did sting initially but doesn&#x27;t anymore. Glad to have found something that works!</li>
    <li> At first, the product took at least a week to start working and have experienced some redness (reason for 4 star review), but overall  it does work and I apply every 3 days or so. I&#x27;m just happy that I won&#x27;t so many stained  shirts anymore and feeling embarrassed  anymore. Thank you!</li>
    <li> After trying all the supermarket items and reading all the reviews, I decided to order this product. I&#x27;ll tell you what, it really works. No longer do I have embarrassing wet stains under my dress shirts. I&#x27;ve applied it every other day so far and zero sweat stains. I will caution, it stings a bit for 5-10 mins after applying but it&#x27;s a small price to pay. Order it, it works.</li>
    <li> Great product, took some time but definitely works!</li>
    <li> My daughter stated that this product &amp;#34;CHANGED HER LIFE&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Zerosweat for allowing my daughter to enjoy her days without worrying about under arm sweat stains.</li>
    <li> When the impossible is possible.  This stuff is great!  Only have to use it every couple of days and best to use it at night. Great dealer to work with and shipping was lightning fast!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical because I work flying helicopters in the hot desert and I sweat profusely all the time in the summer. However, after using this, I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;pit-out.&amp;#34; I recommend for anyone that needs protection better than even prescription deodorants.  Finally a product that works when and where I need it the most.</li>
    <li> It takes a little while to start working but it definitely works. 3-4 times a week...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 17 year old son.  He said it works, loves it!</li>
    <li> I have anxiety so i sweat like crazy. I&#x27;ve had this for about 3 weeks now and i definitely see improvements. I used it every night before bed for 4 days in a row, now i can use it 2 days in a row then skip 2 days n its been going well like that so far. I work in a hot factory as well and even tho it still feels like I&#x27;m sweating i look at my shirt and i don&#x27;t see any sweat around my arm pits. Every time i use it it feels like I&#x27;m wearing an irritating scratchy sweater on my arm pits only. But i fall asleep then shower in the morning, put on my mitchum deodorant and the itchy feeling is gone.  I say that&#x27;s a small price to pay for the only thing that has actually ever helped me out with my sweating problem. I never leave reviews but this one is a 5 star product for sure</li>
    <li> It is a very good product. I am trying to figure out why the directions say not to use it after you shower. Isn&#x27;t that the time everyone puts on deoderant?</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had hyperhydrosis since I was 14 and I&#x27;m now 22. I no longer have health insurance so going to the doctor is kinda hard to do but I hoy zero sweat online for a great price and it does wonders! And the awesome thing is you don&#x27;t even have to put it on everyday! Use it once every three days at night before bed and you won&#x27;t sweat a drop:)</li>
    <li> I have been sweating alot for about a year even in the winter and this is the first time thy I am completely dry!! Works better than advertised.. Excellent!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> this is the only deodorant that works for us!! I have tried many many “clinical strength” deodorants and none of them seem to do what they claim.  It is the only deodorant my active girls use that protects them and their costumes for dance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had to get in the habit of applying at night and by default have been experiencing that it works for multiple days with one application.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a miracle! I have the worst sweat stains sometimes on my shirt and in my line of work it is very embarrassing. I couldn&#x27;t even wear colored shirts for that reason. This works and now I can wear whatever I want. I am a skeptic for everything and I was really impressed. Love love it. Will use forever</li>
    <li> I have tried multiple products for hyperhydrosis including prescription dosage with limited success. I have used Certain-Dri over the years and while it has been somewhat effective, it doesn&#x27;t compare to Zero Sweat. Highly recommended. I use at night about every 3-4 days.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Will be sure to buy again!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for a family member who for many years has suffered a number of the same symptoms and embarrassments as reported in the reviews by other individuals diagnosed with axillary hyperhidrosis. This young man does not wear anything other than black tshirts and sweatshirts to cover up the excess sweat stains, and takes multiple showers a day as needed to try and stay fresh.  He has tried a number of products including Certain Dri and Sweat Block with limited success although some products initially had some slight promise but ultimately did not work. He was skeptical in trying ZeroSweat because the ingredients do not seem significantly different from the others, but it has been 2 weeks now and it appears to be working very successfully so far, much better than any other product tried to date. He does use regular deodorant during the day but no longer seems to have that excessive level of sweating! This is the first product that seems to be working and we are keeping our fingers crossed that it will continue to work. I will provide an update again in a month or two.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a very smelly sweater in the summer. What I may lack in quantity is DEFINITELY made up for in quality! I can&#x27;t speak for the effectiveness on profuse sweating but I can tell you it has stopped my sweating COMPLETELY - no more spots when I lift up my arms and no more icky smell. I used to have to shower twice a day in the summer due to this but can now go several days without a shower (only when camping people!!!) and even then I only have to shower for basic Hygeine and not due to smell. You will need to keep it upright in the box or somewhere you can keep it upright without knocking it over because the bottle I had leaked like crazy when I bumped it sideways but that may just be a defective bottle I got. I will be ordering this again and again! Shipping took about a week if I recall, which is average so no delays.</li>
    <li> Hey Everyone,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have hyperhydrosis and it severely effects my underarm area. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products and they&#x27;ll work for a day or too and then I&#x27;m back where I started. Literally after the first night I applied ZeroSweat I started to see results the very next day. After about 3-4 nights of applying the product I&#x27;ve been completely dry! I&#x27;ve been using ZeroSweat for about 3 weeks now applying it only about once or twice a week and the stuff is amazing. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So happy to have a product that works! It&#x27;s nice to get through the day without the embarrassing and annoying sweat stains! Love it!</li>
    <li> An amazing product that has truly owned up to it name. I would recommend zero sweat to any one that has tried everything and still struggling to stay dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those &amp;#34;sweats during the freezing winter&amp;#34; people, and doing manual labour as well, nothing worked for me. I went through every clinical strength antiperspirant and was worried I would have to start getting shots to ever stop leaking under my arms....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is AMAZING!!! I haven&#x27;t pitted a single shirt once since buying it. I can&#x27;t possibly imagine not using it now, as my underarms stay dry as a bone. I use it every 3 days now, and even if I go longer, I&#x27;m still good!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to be able to wear light coloured shirts again! Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> My battle shall continue as this product was the same as all the others that have aluminum chloride as the active ingredient. Works well for the first few days then not so much after.</li>
    <li> I have searched for an antiperspirant that actually works! Nothing had until I found ZeroSweat! I can actually feel comfortable in my clothes and not worry about perspiring! So thankful for the pros that finally invented a miracle!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical as nothing else worked...but this works great. I use it every other night and it keeps me dry</li>
    <li> The actual product is amazing. I can&#x27;t believe how much it has changed my life. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the roll on function is pretty annoying. It often leaks when you&#x27;re trying to roll it in. I wish they made this product in a solid or spray form.</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery great product!</li>
    <li> Zero Sweat is the only antiperspirant that I have found to actually work. I consider this product to be a blessing as I am a youth pastor that gets a little nervous speaking to a crowd. I would begin to sweat extremely bad, causing a lot of embarrassment. I was amazazed at how well this product worked. This product has saved my life from the fear of being seen with severe sweat stains. I can now speak with confidence! Thank you for this awesome product!</li>
    <li> Absolutely terrific stuff. Works as described. Would try it for sure.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;ve tried just about everything else (various \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; antiperspirants and home remedies) nothing had been working. I would still sweat buckets (only from my underarms) and have to change shirts multiple times in a day. I tried certain-dry and while it worked the irritation wasn&#x27;t worth it. I was expecting a bit more from this product given its guarantees, but it did eventually work. The key is USE IT EVERY DAY UNTIL IT STARTS WORKING and don&#x27;t apply it in a wide area and don&#x27;t apply too much... also for me it irritates anywhere I don&#x27;t grow hair (if you&#x27;re a guy trim your underarm hair so it soaks into your pores better). I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks and it&#x27;s only been working for about 4 days (I did not use any other kind of deodorant or antiperspirant during that time). Not 100% dry but I can go through the day without pit-stained shirts and hopefully that will allow me to stop needing to discard ruined clothes so often (that would make up for the cost). I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because the results I&#x27;m seeing lead me to believe I&#x27;ll need to use it just about every day and the irritation (sort of a burning itch) is manageable but still a bit uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 12-10-14&lt;br /&gt;I had to change my rating to 5 stars as this product has been working great for the last several months. It took a while to get used to but now I only need it once every 2-3 days and it eliminates underarm sweating 100%. I would definitely recommend this product but with the warning that it can take longer than they claim to get the results. What&#x27;s more, I also used one stick for 4 MONTHS, and that was in summer! Maybe I wasn&#x27;t applying enough, but any more would irritate the skin. I can forget to use it for 4 or 5 days now and still not sweat AT ALL from my underarms unless I&#x27;m actually working out, which is perfect. 5 months after my initial purchase, I&#x27;m still on my second stick and I&#x27;m so much more comfortable. There&#x27;s also the added benefit that I don&#x27;t have to throw away stained shirts from sweat/antiperspirant. This is definitely the most life altering product I&#x27;ve found on Amazon :)</li>
    <li> I was skeptical as NOTHING I ever tried in the lines of &amp;#34;wetness protection&amp;#34; anti-perspirants ever did a thing for me. After a few weeks of using this product I&#x27;m happy to say the days of pitting out for no reason are behind me. Great product...will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this item for a few months now and it does work great.  My only reason for the 4 out of 5 stars is because the roll on applicator is pretty bad.  There is no way the bottle will last as long as it states with how much drips out when you apply it.  I do use it daily (only had redness/itching on the first two days) and I never have any issues.  I will occasionally miss a day here and there but the sweating comes back but I have an extreme case.</li>
    <li> Love it! Stop my rediculous amount of sweat! Ya I&#x27;m that guy that is always sweating or was! Highly recommend this product! :)</li>
    <li> If anyone has issues with ruining their dress shirts with sweat stains this is product for them.  No more spray and wash when I get home from work!  I am so impressed with this product that I have already purchased more so I won&#x27;t run out.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for coming up with such an amazing product.</li>
    <li> For a guy living with hyperhidrosis, wearing light colored shirts was not an option. However, with Zerosweat, I can now wear whatever I want! All day protection for approximately three days. Thanks Zerosweat!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on hands and feet for about two weeks. Still working out how often I need to apply, but so far I have noticed some improvement, to my tremendous relief. Will update once in more familiar with product.</li>
    <li> Immediately after putting it on, I had a strong burning under my arm. It lasted ALL night. Please buy with caution</li>
    <li> It really works. It is a little Irritating to the skin at first but after a well or so the irritation was over. This is a product I will keep using.</li>
    <li> Incredible that it actually works!! I use ZeroSweat every three days (at night) and my armpits don&#x27;t sweat at all. It took a couple of weeks (using it more often) to get it to start working, but now it works like a charm. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because of the mild irritation my pits feel shortly after applying it (itchy/burning). It mostly goes away, but every now and then my pits will get a little itchy....it&#x27;s not too bad and it&#x27;s worth the zero sweat. :)</li>
    <li> First product to actually help stop excessive sweating. It does itch quite a bit at first, but not too bad. Completely worth it.</li>
    <li> I was previously using a different brand but then they decided to &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; it and came out with a new formula which is completely useless. ZeroSweat is the only one that still contains just the three basic ingredients of Aluminum Chloride, Baking Soda and Water. You can try all the other brands but they are loaded with way too many junk ingredients to actually work effectively. Save yourself a lot of time, money, and frustration and just go directly with ZeroSweat.&lt;br /&gt;To the few people who complain that ZeroSweat is too irritating: I suspect that you are probably using way too much of it. You honestly only need just a couple strokes under each arm, that&#x27;s it. And most people only need to use it about once or twice a week. Give ZeroSweat about a month of use exactly according to directions and it should work for you. If it doesn&#x27;t work then you may have severe hyperhidrosis that might require a prescription. Drysol works on severe hyperhidrosis for people who have tried everything else.</li>
    <li> For those of you that have tried everything else, this product is for you. Plain and simple...it works. Hands down the most effective product I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
    <li> My entire life I dealt with trying to hide uncomfortable, stinky, sweaty armpits.  I used to sweat through suits, hooded fleeces, jackets, you name it, I could sweat through it. This product really works.  I wish I had known about it sooner.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works. I used to sweat buckets, every day. I&#x27;ve been using this for less than a month &amp; already have seen results. I hardly sweat at all (only when its hot &amp; I&#x27;m moving around a lot, but even then its less than before). The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because it burns/itches like crazy if you use to much (a full roll is too much for me). Only need to use a little bit for it to work.</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive.&lt;br /&gt;Most of the pharmacies in my area were having problems with back orders for my prescription for my feet and I had tried so many over the counter foot products.&lt;br /&gt;I finally broke down and purchased Zero Sweat. I am so grateful that I did!&lt;br /&gt;I roll it out on my palm and apply to feet, I like the feel and the way it dries so quickly. No odor at all!.&lt;br /&gt;After years of embarrassing foot sweat and odor I can wear boots, tennis shoes or any other closed shoe.&lt;br /&gt;Yepee! Thanks, Lisa</li>
    <li> At first I was very skeptical about ZeroSweat. I&#x27;ve suffered from horrible underarm sweat for years, I&#x27;m talking like wet underarms within an hour of putting a shirt on. But this stuff is a miracle. The first couple times I used it it was severely itchy and my armpits became red and sore,(I&#x27;m thinking because I got it on the skin that doesn&#x27;t grow hair around my armpit) so I gave it a rest for two or three days. I think that you just have to build a tolerance to it because when I use it now,every two or three days, It doesn&#x27;t itch or turn red and sore. But I no longer worry about sweat stains and it is the best thing in the world. I give it 4 stars only because of the itchy and soreness when I started using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a heavy sweater, and frankly it&#x27;s embarrassing.  I&#x27;ve tried the sports brands, spray on, natural remedies, but ZeroSweat actually works.  It&#x27;s been a huge confidence booster to be able to work in a long sleeve shirt without undershirts just to hide the sweat.</li>
    <li> Works great, wore black for years because of underarm stains, feels good to finally wear colors again. Some itching an hour or two after applying but totally worth the comfort of being able to show your underarms in public.</li>
    <li> Yes, it works! As a matter of fact, works so well, I am about to see what other types of products this company makes. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> A couple of months ago I had a severe sports injury which triggered hyperhidrosis in my arm. I tried ever antiperspirant from mild to clinical, and was still sweating through my shirt. Out of embarrassment, I was selective with clothing selection so it would become less noticeable. I researched quite a few options including laser treatment and now that I have found Zero Sweat, I don&#x27;t have to look anymore. I received the product last night, followed the instructions and today was stress free and I wasn&#x27;t self-conscious, because it worked. No more sweating. I am forever thankful. FL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00K4I91RG ZeroSweat Antiperspirant - 100% Guarantee - 72 Hour Protection - No Mess Application - 2 Month Supply]]</li>
    <li> the product arrived on time but the product is kind of watery</li>
    <li> Works so great. I had realized that I used to sweat for no reason. I found out that it was excessive sweating and decided to look up some products. I bought this and it gave me such a confident booster, I WILL purchase this product again. May irritate a little but worth it.</li>
    <li> Keeps me dry with my backpack on or off. If you read the instructions first (unlike me) there should be no problem.</li>
    <li> Keeps me from smelling so bad. Not bad for its price.</li>
    <li> This is truly an awesome product for a person like me who sweats a lot in underarm area. I was initially in doubt about 72 hour claims, but after using it just few times, I became a fan :) I use it after taking shower before I go to bed and it helps me stay odor and sweat free for 48 hours ( i re apply it after 48 hours but I think it can work even longer)  Do not use it immediately after shaving, it can irritate the skin. I have been using it for 3 months now and still still didnt run out of my bottle.</li>
    <li> It hasn&#x27;t been a week yet so I don&#x27;t know if the product will continue to work, but so far so good. I definitely noticed a big difference on day 2, which is just amazing! As somebody who sweats a lot, I am very thankful to have found this product. I wore a white shirt to test if it would work, and at the end of the day... no sweat marks!! Woohoo! My only problem was I definitely experienced a burning/itching sensation the first 2 times I put it on, but the third time I did&#x27;t feel anything. I&#x27;m really hoping this product continues to work.</li>
    <li> Best thing that I can say.....no sweat!!</li>
    <li> I cant believe this product! absolutely life changing - seriously - I was googling botox when i decided to try this product and I am absolutely amazed with the results. (this is the only product review I have ever bothered to write)</li>
    <li> Ive tried everything for my underarm hyperhidrosis and this seems the best so far.</li>
    <li> I just received this a few days ago. To get started I used it for 3 nights in a row. After just the first application I was completely dry the next day. It does have a little itching discomfort after applying it, but it is well worth it. I&#x27;ve been dry everyday for 3 days! This even includes being outside in the heat doing yard work. I&#x27;m hoping this lasts long-term. So far I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Helps but isnt great. Applying everyday doesnt yield dryness.</li>
    <li> Zero Sweat has really worked for me.  After the first application at night, the following day the wetness diminished.  I am amazed at the results.  I am now using Zero Sweat every 3 days.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, I&#x27;ve suffered from excess sweating all my life and finally found something that stops it almost completely. I had never been able to wear light colored clothes, and always had the sweating problem designating I my had. Will definitely be ordering more!</li>
    <li> I was excited to see that such a product existed. Unfortunately this product is way to strong. I followed the directions using a small amount, but experienced such horrible burning that lasted about 1 hr followed by itching which lasted just about the remainder of the day. I had read that some experienced burning or tingling which was short lived. Too much effort to return, so wasted money for me.&lt;br /&gt;9/1/15. Update. Instructions say to apply at night and this is what I did; however, I shower at night and applied Zerosweat. Instructions, also state that this product should not be applied when pores are open. Hence, this is why I experienced so much burning. It does say to apply at night, but only if you don&#x27;t shower or bathe at night. So this time I waited until the am to apply and there was no burning and no perspiration for me with only one use.&lt;br /&gt;I needed to come back and clarify my first review so the product would not get a negative rating.  So this time it gets ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ as compared to my ⭐️ review.</li>
    <li> Works great. So good, that my girlfriend has been using it too.</li>
    <li> Purchased for 20 yr old daughter.  She says that it works great.  Saved us a trip to the dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Dog loves them. Considers them a treat, after several weeks he seems to be improving.</li>
    <li> Overall good, but should be called SomeSweat. Definitely works better than most in-store antiperspirants.</li>
    <li> TL;DR: ZeroSweat worked for me after trying numerous alternatives. If you value your clothing and appearance, buy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I&#x27;ve suffered from hyperhydrosis. From high school to the working world, I&#x27;ve ruined many a shirt with the dreaded &#x27;canary&#x27; stains. I&#x27;ve tried numerous expensive over-the-counter antiperspirants and even talked to my doctor about it. However, the antiperspirant recommended to me  by my doctor irritated my skin and required shaving due to containing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting tired of antiperspirants I looked into sweat gland botox injection surgery, but I was astonished to see that it was over $1000 for treatments that only lasted 8-12 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking to amazon, I tried to find a antiperspirant that had non-irritant ingredients, and that was when I discovered ZeroSweat. This stuff is incredible, I was so shocked to actually have dry underarms after a day of work. I didn&#x27;t even have to shave, although I&#x27;m sure it works better if you do. All I did was trim my underarm hair, and it still absorbed like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this product is that I can&#x27;t buy it in a bigger container, nor can I buy it at a bulk discount. $20 is a bit high, but then is it really when you consider the alternative? Washing and soaking shirts after wearing them,  expensive plastic surgery, or irritating alcohol based antiperspirants?</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a month now and after 11 years of dealing with excessive underarm sweating and working in finance (ie trying to wear business and business casual attire that would conceal sweating) I can say this product works!!  Yes, it&#x27;s itchy and a bit burny when you apply it, but as long as I do it at least every other night, I am sweat free in my underarms!!!  If you go a few days without putting in on, it&#x27;ll take a few days to start working at 100%.  Hope it continues to work!!</li>
    <li> It works. Only thing u need to know.</li>
    <li> I have received this product about 2 weeks ago, and I have been using it since .&lt;br /&gt;At the beginning,  the first couple days, I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference, but I kept on using it.&lt;br /&gt;I used it every night for a whole week , even though it says to use it every 3 days. It did start showing some improvement after that :D&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I could say, don&#x27;t use it after shaving  as mentioned on their package... it can be really uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I have seen some people say that they have some irritation from Zero, but luckily I only feel a bit ticklish and have no problem falling asleep with it.&lt;br /&gt;I really do recommend this product, I now only have to use it every 3 days and feel more comfortable in my own clothes.&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy that now I can wear any shirt I want, and not worry about some ugly under armpit wetness.</li>
    <li> leaks and alot comes out at once</li>
    <li> Not the best, and it does not keep you dry up to 7 days! I would say maybe for 2 days. It does sting a little, but that goes away fast.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve taken someone to several medical doctors and tried ALMOST EVERY product on the market and nothing worked, not even prescription deodorants.  This PRODUCT works.  They can bust out in a sweat just sitting down.  The sweat is very musty and ruins their clothes etc.  The next day, after first using this product they put on a silk blouse and wore it ALL DAY, and NO SWEAT.  They will be a customer FOR LIFE!</li>
    <li> Love this product, it really works!! Buy it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a difference since I&#x27;ve started using this produce. I would recomend it to anyone. It doesn&#x27;t burn your under arms whe you use it. I haven&#x27;t complement stopped sweating but it definitely works</li>
    <li> Great product that actually works.  I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;clincal&amp;#34; antiperspirants that are not affective. After the first use the product does create an itchy sensation on the skin that I didn&#x27;t care for.</li>
    <li> What a great product!  Does exactly what it says it will do. I am surprised it took so long to get something on the market that works so hard against excessive perspiration.</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t someone invent this sooner?  This is perfect for the hot, 100 degree+ summers that I live through.  Super fast shipping too, thank you!!</li>
    <li> Now I don&#x27;t have excessive underarm sweat. This works great.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I can&#x27;t even express how happy I am with this stuff!! Customer for life!!</li>
    <li> It seems to work for a day, but the need to constantly reapply every night it&#x27;s taxing...</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with ZEROSWEAT.  After searching for an alternative to prescription strength antiperspirants, I stumbled up this item, ordered it, and a month later think it is the best item out there.  I have little to no irritation after applying it and find that one application will last me a solid week without reapplying Zerosweat.  That says a lot to me because I am very active all day and don&#x27;t want embarrassing sweat stains.  If are like me and want something that WORKS, this is it.  BUY IT.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t oversweat, but I do sweat in heat as everyone else does.  I think this product made me sweat more than I normally do.  I&#x27;m a fit male that works out regularly &amp; eats somewhat healthy.  I also drink mostly water.  This product did not work for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff does work!  I must admit, I am terrible at remembering to put it on at night if I don&#x27;t have to put it on every day, however even with my inconsistency the product does what it is advertized to do.  It makes life a lot easier.</li>
    <li> The best product i ever bought. Im really happy with the results and it really works like it said.</li>
    <li> Yes! Finally something that actually works! I have tried SO many products over the years and pretty much gave up and figured that I would just have to deal with excessive sweating forever. One day I was given ZeroSweat to try and I was very skeptical and didn&#x27;t think it would work. I went ahead and tried it and now I can honestly say that this product has changed my life! It actually worked when no other product ever did. And it continues to work a month later! I will forever be a customer and will also be buying this product for my teenage daughter. Thank you ZeroSweat!!!</li>
    <li> I have suffered from very terrible hyperhydrosis since I hit puberty. The worst is in my underarms amd low back/groin area. Certain Dri did work for me, but then they changed their ingredients. I have used ZeroSweat as advertised for three nights, and I was 100% sweat free from my underarms at work today. I got a shower and waited an hour to put it on for the night and played some video games (I used to sweat excessively during gaming too), and not a single drop of sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to update this after I go through my first bottle.</li>
    <li> First time using ZeroSweat antiperspirant and I love it. It doesn&#x27;t iritate my skin like Certaindri which by the way didn&#x27;t stop me from sweating. I will continue to use ZeroSweat because it really works</li>
    <li> this doesn&#x27;t hold on me. I wake up smelling like I never put anything on at all</li>
    <li> Boy, where do I start?????? I really never leave reviews but I would be remiss if I didn&#x27;t leave a review.. This product is wonderful, I have struggled with sweaty armpits for years.. My closet is full of dark colors that would not as much when i sweat. I have only been using this product for 1 week and the very next day no sweat!!!!!!! OMG, the first day I thought is was a fluke... Then the next day no sweat, so since I have started this product no sweat!!!! I have been wearing shirts that I bought because I liked them and they have been hanging in my closet, because I knew if I put this coral, grey, pink or lime green shirt on it would surely show my embarrassing sweaty armpits. I have not had much irritation except when I used it 2 nights in a row because I was scared to go more than 1 day without using product, so i use every other night... I&#x27;m so excited about all the colors I will be able to wear from this point on!!!!!!!!! The other reviews helped me make my decision, so I hope this helps someone out there because I know what you are going through.... Good Luck ;-)</li>
    <li> Ok product. Not for everyone</li>
    <li> this is an absolute Godsend...I work long hours and sweat a lot, I was at wits end trying to figure out what to do short of going to a Dr to get this resolved, Day 1 was sweating before I bought it, I showered and since it was my day off a relaxed, I put some on about 5pm since wasn&#x27;t going anywhere, next day woke up normally smell like sweat and nothing, day 2, again nothing, but have been putting normal deodorant on daily but no sweat while working, day 3 still nothing, day 4, once again nothing, im not sure if this is day 5 or 6 but either way, I went outside in 93 degrees in holt sunny florida, doing yard work, my back was all sweaty smelled my armpits and nothing, no odor...since people say it is about a week before needs it again, im doing it as precaution, but, like I said I have been using normal deodorant everyday, but even with that and overdosing on that, by days end it was horrific and embarrassing smells and now im a firm believer in this product and just pray it never goes off the market for people like myself because although I knew I wasn&#x27;t the only one with this embarrassing problem, its nice to know there is a great product invented for this!!!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product; the company stands behind its product and most of the reviews were glowing. But whenever I applied this stuff to my underarms, I felt this immediate burning and itching. It was truly unbearable. I have never had sensitivity in my underarms area so I&#x27;m not sure what ingredient caused the irritation; but I tried multiple times and got the same painful reaction with each application. Please be careful when using this. I would do a test patch before applying it fully to both under arm areas.</li>
    <li> We bought this for my daughter to use for her sweaty palms. So far it has worked great!</li>
    <li> The first day of using zero sweat I was disappointed, it reduced the sweat by about 10%. But the second day i was completely dry! I really recommend this if you suffer from excessive sweating or hyperhidrosis (same thing). I will tell you this,if you plan to your shave your underarms when the product arrives it will irritate a lot! I recommend you shave the same day you place your order, so by the time it arrives It won&#x27;t irritate, I apply every 3 days and use Regular DEODORANT in the mornings NOT ANTI PERSPIRANT!</li>
    <li> I can start by saying I was having hopes about this products since all the reviews were wonderful and the guarantee the company.. Well guaranteed. The product did work a little but sometimes, but just like other people said I felt like I sweated more for some reason. And on top of that it burned me. I&#x27;m not sure how it happened. It wasn&#x27;t after I shaved or waxed .. Nothing. I even waited awhile after my shower. It burned after I applied and I expected that, but the burn left it&#x27;s mark. In the shape that I applied and was sore for a couple of days.. there is a mark in that exact shape. It scabbed as well.. I don&#x27;t really understand, and this is not to scare people away from the product by any means. This was just my experience, and review.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d be fine if it just didn&#x27;t work for me (everyone is different I understand) , and I would get over it. But to burn me to the point of marking me, then scabbing over?..</li>
    <li> Works great! Stings like a mother when applied to freshly shaven skin.</li>
    <li> Follow the directions!  I found this product to be much more effective than others on the market.  The roller makes the application simple, as opposed to sheets of paper inside individual packets.  What a life changer.</li>
    <li> I want to say this product rocks..I&#x27;ve always sweat so bad this is the only product to choose. ..the only one the truly works....the only product I approve ....all the products are junk and don&#x27;t work at all...your product is the one and only  that stands by his ZERO SWEAT...</li>
    <li> Does it work? Yes! Now for the downside. There is a fair amount of itching upon application. It feels similar to a prickly heat rash. I find the itching makes it tough to get to sleep until it settles down. Although this product definitely reduces sweating, I am not entirely sure persevering through the intense itching is worth it.</li>
