      <li>The bottle also feels really nice in your hands, almost like plastic velvet.</li>

      <li>Love the shampoo, and the conditioner is really nice too.</li>
      <li>This is the best conditioning conditioner I have tried by far.</li>
      <li>So I did some research and read more about the Arvazallia Advance Hair repair shampoo and conditioner  </li>
      <li>It is even more moisturizing and hydrating than the Argan Oil Hair Mask in my opinion.</li>
      <li>The Conditioner is my favorite product out of all of them.</li>
      <li>Argan oil is one of the best oils to use in your hair, especially because it improves the texture of your hair follicles.</li>
      <li>recommend these phenomenal products to all of those people who&#x27;ve given up on the idea of restoring damaged hair and also to those who want to prevent their hair from ever getting to the point of no-return.</li>
      <li>My hair is staying in my head more and not ending up at the drain.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner, it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve been using.</li>

      <li>most days I just brush it out after washing and let it go.</li>
      <li>received the product for free in an exchange of an honest review.</li>
      <li>it seems to be giving me more body and hydration w/o oily weight.</li>
      <li>Great product, I highly reccomend it!</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>So will probably get even better.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love any of Arvazallia hair products.  </li>
      <li>The product had leaked out and was all over the top of the bottle.</li>
      <li>That is where my hair is most frizzy and</li>
      <li>have been using this along with the shampoo and mask for over a week, and have to say that I love this conditioner.</li>

      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I have been using this conditioner (along with the shampoo and hair mask of the same brand) and have had great results!</li>
      <li>This passed the hubband head sniffer test :-)</li>
      <li>This product lasts us at most through 5 conditioning treatments.</li>
      <li>It is a nice conditioner that does not leave a build up, but for me, there was nothing special or miracle working about it.</li>
      <li>Something about the new scent just makes me happy</li>
      <li>love the light scent.</li>
      <li>Paired with the Shampoo, it makes my hair more manageable and feeling silky smooth.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have tried many different hair products for my hair to try and make it beautiful but couldn&#x27;t find the right one. But I found that beautiful hair with Arvazallia. Literally after one wash, it left my hair soft and shiny. This is a product that I will buy again ♡♡♡</li>
    <li> The best shampoo I have ever used! This has left my hair feeling soft and volumized! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have long natural dark hair that I dye blond, so needless to say it is very stressed. I have a hard time finding conditioners that do what they say. This is all I will buy from here on out! My hair feels silky with no frizz, but not greasy or heavy. I can brush right through it as soon as I get out of the shower with no tangles and that is unheard of for me. This stuff is wonderful and worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I really havent noticed a difference. I have long, thick over processed hair.  I am on day 4 of using it, i even left it over night, but my hair does not feel drastically different. I have been using Enjoy Luxury conditioner and my hair feels much softer.  I will give it a fair try and keep using it though...will let you know.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!  Has helped my hair so much, feels so soft!!! I am truly amazed and surprised but how much I love this stuf and his well it works! Got it to try and world for sure purchase this when im out, my hair feels back to normal, soft, frizz free and not so dead looking, love love love this stuff</li>
    <li> I love it, it leaves my hair soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> I really like this conditioner, it smells good, leaves your hair feeling super soft, and smooth. It is thick, the only downside is how difficult it is to get it out of the bottle. I kept shaking and squeezing, it took quite a moment. The bottle is good sized though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample Provided.</li>
    <li> I love the way this is working so far. My hair is pretty damaged so only time will tell but for the improvement so far I have to give 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have a tailbone length hair so keeping my hair as healthy and chemical free as possible is my first priority when it comes to that. I do have to heat style my hair ever so often which damages it and makes my hair and the ends pretty dry and damp like so that’s why I need something that actually helps to nurse my hair back to health. Most shampoos nowadays include a lot of chemicals that ruin and dry out your hair even more (even though they promise all kinds of miracles) so that’s definitely not a solution for it. So I&#x27;m using Arvazilla Repair Moisturizing shampoo along with the Daily Hair Conditioner to maximize the results and keep my hair healthy and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is great about the Arvazallia Daily Hair Conditioner:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sulfate free. If you didn’t know then sulfates is what makes the shampoo turn into a thick lather in the shower and is also used in other household cleaning products. This is what actually causes frizziness especially in curly hair and damages hair that is color treated and makes it fade off quicker. It might take a little getting used to it because it doesn’t bubble up like typical shampoos do. It is also known that sulfates might cause cancers so that’s something to take into consideration.&lt;br /&gt;*Paraben free. It has been found that parabens contain agents called xenoestrogens which are what mimic estrogen in the body and what has been linked to breast cancer and reproductive issues.&lt;br /&gt;*Includes Argan and Macadamia oil. Argan oil is one of the best oils to use in your hair, especially because it improves the texture of your hair follicles. Macadamia oil on the other hand helps to prevent against hair breakage by penetrating the scalp and hair follicles to improve hair strength and elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;*got a fresh floral scent to it&lt;br /&gt;*is for all hair types&lt;br /&gt;*helps to repair the heat damage and fully hydrate your hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt extremely soft after using the shampoo along with the conditioner. The floral scent is still there even the day after and my hair ends aren&#x27;t as dry as they were so I can definitely see a difference. If you haven’t tried Arvazallia Repair Moisturizing shampoo yet along with Daily Hair Conditioner then you really should because it’s the closest thing to natural chemical free you can get without having to make one yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product for free in an exchange of an honest review.oral scent is still there even the day after and my hair ends aren&#x27;t as dry as they were so I can definitely see a difference.

    <li> These products are amazing. My hair was a mess from coloring it,flat ironing  and blow drying. It now looks and feels like silk.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you !!!!&lt;br /&gt;Patricia</li>
    <li> I absolutely love any of Arvazallia hair products.  I have very long &amp; thick hair that has a mind of its own.  Their products help me manage my hair.  I would definitely recommend their products!!!</li>
    <li> Smells good; foams up well and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue</li>
    <li> This conditioner has the WORST, old-lady perfume smell that I&#x27;ve ever experienced. It&#x27;s so pungent and harsh, it&#x27;s hard to use. It does work well if you can get past the smell. I won&#x27;t buy again because of it.</li>
    <li> LOVE it! Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Made my hair so silky smooth. Do you guys sell this in the large bottles?</li>
    <li> Great product - my hair feels healthier and this conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave heavy residue.</li>
    <li> Affordable product. Prompt shipping. Only been using product about a week, but so far, I love it. Leaves my hair smelling great and feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m willing to try anything that will help my dry fly aways! Very impressed with the results so far. Makes my hair feel like I just came from the salon. Hopefully, with continual use this product will help my hair mend overall.</li>
    <li> Tonight I just washed with this conditioner for the first time, and I already feel a difference. My hair was slightly dried out/heat-damaged from straightening so much, and it already feels revitalized from my first wash with this product. Unlike some other reviews, I was not given this product for free and bought it out right after doing some online research. I have to say, my money was well spent! It&#x27;s more expensive then the products I normally buy for my hair, but it&#x27;s well worth the extra money. I think this has just become my new conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have to add my feedback on the customer service. I ordered this conditioner along with the accompanying shampoo, but was mistakenly sent 2 conditioners instead of 1 shampoo, and 1 conditioner. I emailed their customer service, and within mere minutes I received a reply stating that they were shipping me the shampoo free of charge along AND letting me keep the extra conditioner I had already received! The problem had been with Amazon&#x27;s distribution center, but they were still incredibly quick to rectify the situation. And I emailed them after 11pm at night! The customer service here is unparalleled. I&#x27;m so happy I decided to try this brand!</li>
    <li> Seems to work great so far. My frizzy hair has calmed down quite a bit but the humidity in mi. Right now is horrid! So will probably get even better.</li>
    <li> This product smells good and works wonderfully! I have always had problems in the past with conditioners not doing quite a great job with keeping my hair moisturized. I&#x27;ve used this Advanced Hair Repair Daily Hair Conditioner by Arvazallia several times and I am now hooked! It makes my hair so shiny and soft! Unlike some conditioners I have used in the past, it keeps my hair moisturized - and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> Bought the shampoo and the defining cream as well.  This line is excellent for curly headed girls like myself.  It is so hard to find products that actually work.  I would highly recommend this product.  In addition, i have below shoulder length hair and only need a small amount of this product.  So I expect it to last for quite a while, unlike other conditioners.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Repair Daily Conditioner (not in combination with the shampoo) for a few weeks now and I have definitely  noticed a difference. So much that I&#x27;ve had friends take notice. You know a product is good when you take folks into your bathroom to pull the conditioner out of the shower to show them! I have medium weight and curl with slight coarseness. I have more issue with deep conditioners and styling products making my hair oily and heavy quickly however with this product- it seems to be giving me more body and hydration w/o oily weight. Yay!</li>
    <li> I recieved this conditioner for review and testing purposes along with the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;The results this conditioner gave me was soft, bouncy and touchable hair. It smells amazing and it&#x27;s infused with argan oil and macadamia oil which is very beneficial for skin and hair. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s makes the Arvazallia conditioner and Shampoo combined a wonderful beneficial hair experience!</li>
    <li> best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ve tried many other brands including shea moisture and treseme moisture complex. Nothing is as good as this, I wish they sold it in larger quantities and I wish it was a bit cheaper. If either of those options were available I&#x27;d give it 5 stars. also wish it was in stores. I have 4b/4c hair and this makes it shine and provides lots of slip.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells AMAZING and makes my hair really soft! I love it!</li>
    <li> This is a very good conditioner,  however, I have long hair and so do my daughters, and this is only 10.14 oz per description, so if you typically buy the larger 32 to 38 oz size this would set you back $54 approx to buy roughly the equivalent plus a few ounces . I wrote the company and suggested they offer a bigger size but it does not look like they are planning to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For families, this gets way too expensive, so if the company are targeting single women, those with short hair,  or less hair, they are probably hitting the target, but they are missing a large segment of the population - those who frequently wash hair and want a larger size; those of us with long and or thick hair, and those of us buying conditioner for more than one. This product lasts us at most through 5 conditioning treatments. I still buy it, but along with several others, while I continue to look for a better option, and better value.</li>
    <li> Use this along with the shampoo. Very pleased. Hair seems healthier.</li>
    <li> this made my dry, damaged hair, so soft and smooth. I love it, worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was sceptical to buy at first, plus it&#x27;s little pricey, but results are amazing!! I have bleached hair and those products make than soft and not frizzy!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love it! Recommend</li>
    <li> Really like this stuff it has helped my perm burned hair tremendously!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft and manageable.  Love it.  my hair feel strong.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this amazing product! I received a full head of highlights from a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; stylist and my hair ended up fried and damaged. It felt and looked like straw.  I thought for sure I was going to have to cut my hair off. The layers around my face were burned so bad they were crispy and singed. I found this product on amazon and decided to try it. Let me just say it has brought my hair back to life. It took a few weeks, but the more I use this product the healthier, softer and shinier my hair becomes. I will never use anything else going forward. I initially bought the 3 pack of the shampoo, conditioner, and mask. The mask was so wonderful. I used it a few times a week to soften my fried hair. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product and the fragrance smells so good! My fiance is always telling me my hair smells great. I also think this product has helped my hair to grow a lot longer because it&#x27;s so healthy. Try this product. You will be happy you did! :)  I posted a pic of my hair from this past weekend.</li>
    <li> Definitely takes some getting used to, but my hair has never been so healthy.  I had bleached my hair and it felt as if it was going to break if I touched.  After a couple weeks using this conditioner, my hair feels better than if I had never bleached it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use after I had a Keratin &amp;#34;blow-out&amp;#34; treatment. Works great! Love the smell. Will continue to purchase as long as I continue to have Keratin treatments for my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner it is so light doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and smells completely amazing, i have tried others that leave my hair completely a dry mess and this one doesn&#x27;t i have bad ends that just soak up this conditioner like crazy and leaves them soft just like the rest of my hair, i couldn&#x27;t have enjoy it anymore in the shower than i already do! It&#x27;s not greasy or sticky or leaves build up, its like it was made just for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC Disclosure: &amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation, Licensed Cosmetologist as of 1996 (expired 2013 i will not renew it due to pricing on the license and renewal classes, major was skincare, haircare and makeup).

    <li> I am currently trying this new hair routine from Arvazallia. After using the shampoo, conditioner and mask twice (following the recommended 4-day cycle), I felt that the texture of my hair has improved. It keep my hair less oily (or longer in ideal state).&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product to review on my blog. I used to in place of my regular shampoo for over a week, and I have been SO in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;The first day was pretty rainy and I was out of mousse, so after washing I put my hair back in a headband. Not the most exciting do&#x27; but it works when the mousse is gone. I literally sat and petted my hair that day. It was incredibly soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the light scent. It is not drowning out my perfume, or making me smell it all day. But I can smell it on my hands after all the petting ( A LOT OF PETTING.) It did not bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not feel my hair was weighed down, and I have very fine hair. VERY pleased with this product line.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> As a quick FYI, I have baby fine hair that is color treated and damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this along with the shampoo and mask for over a week, and have to say that I love this conditioner. After shampooing, I need conditioner to bring my hair back to life. I apply this on, let it sit for 3 minutes or so, then wash it out. My hair is left feeling super soft, smooth, and shiny. I tend to concentrate this starting at the middle of my hair down through the ends. That is where my hair is most frizzy and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased that this doesn&#x27;t weigh down my baby fine hair at all, which most conditioners tend to do. So bonus points there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one problem is how the bottle was sealed. I had this issue with the shampoo and conditioner bottles. The aluminum piece that is used to seal the bottle opening just wasn&#x27;t sealed properly. The product had leaked out and was all over the top of the bottle. Thankfully the bottles are all individually shrink wrapped so it didn&#x27;t make a mess while shipping, but I did have to clean up each bottle and lost some of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like this conditioner a lot and it does seem to work well with my stubborn hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> After shampooing my hair, it is a tangled mess unless I use conditioner on it. And a lot of conditioner. Without it, not only is my hair hard to brush out, it is wild woman hair when it comes to styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On most days I just brush it out after washing and let it go. This is where I can tell the differences in conditioners. I have been using this product for a couple of weeks and wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it at first. It took about a week of use before I really noticed a difference. According to the product information, this is common and the interim period was when the product was removing the build up and restoring my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am sure that I will be really sad when the bottle runs out! The scent is just yummy and it leaves my hair soft and easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> I just tried the shampoo and conditioner and I really do love it. No tangles, shine, and nice smell. Do I recommend these? I am going to order the mask as soon as I finish this! So, oh yeah!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love this product. First it smells amazing. My four year old described it as delicious. And it really has done wonders for my hair which is thick coarse and naturally wavy/curly. I also purchased the curl cream which has the same smell which is a plus. And equally amazing. Would highly recommend these products!!!</li>
    <li> This is sulfate free and paraben free, which is a huge plus. It also has great ingredients in it, like argan oil and macadamia oil. The bottle also feels really nice in your hands, almost like plastic velvet. This has helped thicken and strengthen my hair and all produce a nice shine. This is ideal for dry, damaged, weak, and processed hair, which I definitely need. I saw a difference immediately after using it and everytime I use it and now, my hair feels softer, bouncier, more manageable, and less brittle. Great stuff and super beneficial to the hair and scalp. My hair is also easier to comb after using the conditioner, which is always a plus. This is a nourishing conditioner that is nice and thick, without weighing your hair down. Certain conditioners (especially ones with argan oil in them) tend to make my hair kinda greasy the second day, but I have no problem with this one. It just leaves my hair soft, smooth, and manageable. And it smells so great on top of everything.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! It works wonderful on my hair. The conditioner really gets down to the scalp and makes my hair feel so moisturized.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this conditioner.  It is really thick and my hair has never looked so healthy.  I will continue to purchase this and the shampoo by Arvazallia.  I also have the intense conditioner which I use once a week.  Love, love, love this product</li>
    <li> Admittedly, I have problem hair.  It&#x27;s wonderfully thick and has oodles of volume but has a tendency towards dryness that drives me crazy.  This conditioner has a great smell but it leaves my hair feeling as if it is coated with something.  This makes it dry nice and sleek...but it does not seem to actually get into my hair.  So it conditions it visually, but not genuinely.  I have been using it for a few months now and my ends are starting to support this gut feeling--looking dry and brittle with increased split ends.  I have tried countless formulas and brands and have found few &amp;#34;winners&amp;#34;.  Most previously I used Redken All Soft, but their formula change left me wanting more so I decided to give this a try.  Solid conditioner, but the search continues!</li>
    <li> So far this product seems to be okay.  I can&#x27;t really tell in the 4 washes and conditions that I&#x27;ve used it, that it is any different than the other repairing conditioner that I have tried.  I has a floral smell which isn&#x27;t bad, I&#x27;m just a coconut kind of woman and don&#x27;t care for flowery scents very much.  It isn&#x27;t overpowering though and once it is washed out, and my hair is dry, there is barely any smell to it at all.  I am a 42 year old, Caucasian woman who has extremely dry, natural curly hair.  I can only wash it every 3 - 4 days because it is so dry.  According to the &amp;#34;dramatic&amp;#34; differences in some of the reviews, I was hoping for really super soft, bouncy, manageable hair to come from this product.  It is a nice conditioner that does not leave a build up, but for me, there was nothing special or miracle working about it.</li>
    <li> This smells really good, leaves my hair soft and manageable, and I only need to use a small amount.</li>
    <li> Extra virgin coconut oil from Jamaica works better</li>
    <li> Not as good as other things I have purchased. Seeking return</li>
    <li> WOW - I have extremely fine long bleached hair (it&#x27;s almost invisible) and it feels like a wet ball of cotton after shampoo. This product smooths it out to comb out easily in the shower. It may also control static, not sure because that&#x27;s mainly my problem during winter. Now I&#x27;m able to have shoulder length hair which gives me a few more options for styling it.</li>
    <li> Great product so far. I started using the conditioner about 3 weeks ago and really like it. It has the same feel as a deep conditioner but not the greasiness from daily use. I was able to tell the difference from other daily conditioners from the first use. Looking forward to trying out the shampoo too.</li>
    <li> Not geared for African American people hair type.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo, and the conditioner is really nice too. It does not weigh the hair down like so many conditioners.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve been using. My hair is staying in my head more and not ending up at the drain.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I used to fight my curls every day but no more.  This product rocks the curl!!</li>
    <li> The Conditioner is my favorite product out of all of them. It smells amazingly sweet and fresh and it leaves my hair super silky. It is even more moisturizing and hydrating than the Argan Oil Hair Mask in my opinion. This is the best conditioning conditioner I have tried by far. I would say it is comparable to the conditioners that come inside of a hair dye box. Those are like gold to me and this is treated the same way. A super special treat to my hair. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions</li>
    <li> very hard to  get out of container</li>
    <li> Great for dry fragile hair....very pleased with the product!</li>
    <li> I cannot say it is a miracle for my hair! I have used it for about a week and there is not much difference than before I started! I figured by now I would feel something new and exciting about the texture, but so far absolutely nothing. I will use the whole thing before actually giving up!!</li>
    <li> Love this for curly hair!</li>
    <li> My hair feels so silky and smooth every time I use it and has been easier to manage.</li>
    <li> Did not see any improvement in my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner (along with the shampoo and hair mask of the same brand) and have had great results! My hair is normally very dry and dull looking and pretty unmanageable. After using this conditioner for a few days I saw a difference. It appeared shinier and smoother and felt softer and less straw like! I love that this conditioner is sulfate free! So many conditioners on the market contain harsh chemicals that doesn&#x27;t help or hair at all. The Macadamia and Argan Oil combination in this conditioner has helped repair my dry hair. This conditioner is well worth the price!</li>
    <li> LOVE this Conditioner! My hair feels fantastic after using it. Instant results in detangling my hair. This bottle is bound to last me a long time. I have used it about 5 times already and it feels like I have barely made a dent in it. Paired with the Shampoo, it makes my hair more manageable and feeling silky smooth. *sample provided for review*</li>
    <li> So far this product seems to be working well.</li>
    <li> I have really coarse, thick, super curly hair that needs a lot of moisture. This product provides it! I love that I can get a comb through my hair with this conditioner and that it feels soft and looks shiny. Great product, I highly reccomend it!</li>
    <li> I was recently given the opportunity to try a new hair care system. I love changing my shampoo and conditioner. Something about the new scent just makes me happy and it&#x27;s always an added bonus when your hair feels amazing afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;Arvazallia Advanced Hair Repair Moisturizing Shampoo and Repair Daily Conditioner are Members of the Arvazallia Advanced Hair Repair System. These products are specially formulated to work in combination to Restore, Strengthen, and Revitalize hair that is dry or that has been damaged or weakened by heat styling, chemical processing, or coloring.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t colored my hair in a few years but I have been putting highlights in.  I have been wearing my hair a little longer than my usual chin length bob of some sort so I have noticed the damage that has been done.&lt;br /&gt;I am obsessed with how these products smell!  I feel like I just stepped out of a salon each time I shower!  My hair is so soft and full of volume which I struggle with.  The shampoo is thick and really lathers up even though it doesn&#x27;t have sulfates or parabens which makes me love it even more!  The conditioner is a great detangler and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! It has helped with breakage and split ends. I will be purchasing the shampoo that goes with it. I love the look and feel of my hair after I use it!</li>
    <li> Yeah, a reasonably priced product that really works!  Leaves my chemically treated hair solf, manageable every time.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! It is thick and smells AMAZING! I also love the bright red bottles. I did recieve this product complimentary from the seller for my unbiased opinion</li>
    <li> Please note that this product was sent to me for FREE in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok the first time I used the shampoo I was confused mainly because it wasn&#x27;t lathering up so I added more shampoo which was a waste because it still didn&#x27;t lather up. Until I read the label again on the bottle and noticed that it mentioned it was sulfate free, now that explains the no lathering. So I did some research and read more about the Arvazallia Advance Hair repair shampoo and conditioner  and what it&#x27;s offering. Turns out that that you have to at least use the products for at least a week or 2 in order to see a real difference in your hair. Well I&#x27;m glad I did, at first it annoyed me because it felt like my hair wasn&#x27;t clean and still felt oily and for some reason seemed even more lifeless which is odd because I have flat hair, how much more flat can one&#x27;s hair get!? but after about a week and 1/2 I realized my hair looked AMAZING and I mean nice hair, the nicest it&#x27;s ever been, it was so soft and shinny and static free! which is rare for me. The shampoo does need a little getting used to since it doesn&#x27;t lather up but the benefits are worth it, as for the conditioner, I love how it feels on my hair in the shower it feels very silky and the bonus part is that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily at all, plus they have a great scent! As for the hair Mask, i&#x27;ve honestly have never used one before and after using this one I wish I would of started sooner. I use a hair straightener every day the ends of my hair tend to get really dried up so after using the hair mask my hair looks much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall these products are really nice and I would definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how grateful I am for this incredible hair care system. I saw an instant difference-- not only does it look soft and smooth, it feels hydrated and healthy. I really thought that it was going to take years for my hair to stop breaking and look somewhat healthy, but with this Arvazallia Advanced Hair Care System it only took 4 days for my hair to improve drastically. My hair quit falling out in large amounts, the breaking stopped, and that dry feeling is gone. Now when I run my fingers through my hair all I feel is smooth and silk, soft-to-the-touch hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these phenomenal products to all of those people who&#x27;ve given up on the idea of restoring damaged hair and also to those who want to prevent their hair from ever getting to the point of no-return. Not only will this hair care line help you restore already-damaged hair but it will nourish and hydrate curly, color-treated and heat-exposed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read my full review on my blog- Meandmyminime.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers</li>
    <li> I have extremely fine and thinning hair, so I tend to avoid anything that is &amp;#34;Deep Conditioning&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Moisturizing&amp;#34; in hair products, because I find that they can make my hair greasy or weighed down. Unfortunately, I also have wavy hair that can get dry and brittle, so I&#x27;m always searching for a product line that can smooth and moisturize my hair without making it look like a greasy mess. I had the opportunity to try the Arvazallia line, and figured it would be worth it to see how it would work on my fine, yet damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used both the shampoo and conditioner daily for a week before deciding my final thoughts. Firstly, the scent is just divine. I had 4 people ask me what perfume I was wearing only to realize it was my hair they were referring to! If you don&#x27;t like strongly scented hair products, these might not be up your alley, however I love when my hair smells amazing! After a week of use, I can confidently say that not only does my hair look and feel softer and silkier, but I had no issues with these products making my hair greasy or weighed-down! Halleluiah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was one day that I think I used a bit too much of the conditioner and my hair felt a bit on the heavy side, however I scaled back on the sheer amount I was putting into my hair and that solved the issue immediately. I used the shampoo as you normally would, however I left the conditioner in my hair for about 2 minutes before rinsing, and rinsing well. I didn&#x27;t want to leave any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recently re-colored my hair, and I really do think I&#x27;ve noticed the color staying in my hair longer. For some reason, almost as soon as I dye my hair, it begins to wash out of the root-area. So far, my hair has stayed looking freshly dyed! That also could have to do with the fact that I don&#x27;t always use sulfate-free products, though. Regardless this shampoo has been absolutely fantastic for me!</li>
    <li> WOW! Okay, that doesn&#x27;t really count as a review, huh? When I was sent this haircare trio to review, all I could focus on was the hard to pronounce name :-) After using them, all I could focus on was petting my own head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sulfate free and paraben free, these are safe for all hair types including processed and color treated hair. I&#x27;m often skeptical when shampoos and such claim to work on all hair textures, but I believe it now. My hair is super fine, oily and fairly damaged and using the shampoo and conditioner together made my hair feel silky soft, look amazingly shiny and super clean without being stripped. I swear it actually stayed looking clean and fresh for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo, being sulfate free, doesn&#x27;t overfoam and strip your hair of it&#x27;s natural, scalp protecting oils but still makes it crazy clean. The conditioner made my hair really soft and detangled; amazingly without weighing it down at all. Usually such deep conditioners make my hair limp and lifeless, but this actually had the opposite effect. After being basically bedridden the last 2 weeks, I used the hair mask to try and bring it back to life and it did that and more. This does not look like the hair of someone who&#x27;s been lying in bed like a dirty mop for half a month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful, a subtle fruity scent that had The Mister burying his face in my hear repeatedly. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; and he&#x27;s 6&#x27;4&amp;#34;, so he spends a lot of time smelling my head! This passed the hubband head sniffer test :-)</li>
