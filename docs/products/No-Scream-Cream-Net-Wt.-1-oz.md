### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This stuff is really great!</li>
      <li>My friend recommended this to me, she says it is brilliant</li>
      <li>the product does work great</li>
      <li>Take 2 panadol 30 mins before its much better!</li>
      <li>It works amazingly if you follow the directions.</li>
      <li>It was not verry effective for me, I suspect, because I was not within the time limit.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a difference honestly.</li>
      <li>I purchased this cream so I could wax my own bikini area.</li>
      <li>so our hair tends to be more thicker then most, so  getting waxed was bearable but not so pleasant.</li>
      <li>The amount of discomfort more than doubled on the un-creamed leg.  </li>
      <li>I also have notice taking a pain reliever helps as well before going. :)</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>Nothing will make it so that waxing is painless, but this stuff does a good job taking the edge off if you can find the right timing for it.</li>
      <li>Try to get as much as you can if you find it for a good price too.</li>
      <li>The pain can be reduced from a 9/10 to a 5/10 easily with this cream.</li>
      <li>It is amazing how much it reduces the pain.</li>
      <li>had to use the product a couple of times before I figured out how to really get the most out of it, but hopefully if you buy this product what I&#x27;ve learned and shared will help you get the most out of it</li>
      <li>I have a lot of pain when I get my bikini and underarms sugared, and I was excited to try this product.</li>
      <li>had brazilian wax yesterday, and even though it was not the best time of the month to wax ( middle of cycle), I barely felt any pain.</li>
      <li>I use it for full bikini waxing.</li>
      <li>I use the cream only where I really need it and it will be effective (most vascular/ easiest for cream to penetrate).</li>
      <li>But i waxed anyway and well worth the pain.</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>thank you so very much it helped with the pain</li>
      <li>just took the edge of the pain off thank you so very much</li>
      <li>I ordered this for I and my sisters first brazillians.</li>
      <li>If you are self-waxing, try making the paper strips smaller, it makes the pain more bearable.</li>
      <li>Just drink a beer or have a drink first.</li>
      <li>, then I remove the cream on the next section so that the skin gets the most contact with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The pain was as intense as the first time with no cream.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
      <li>but then again, the waxer was so fast that maybe there wouldn&#x27;t have been much pain anyway.</li>
      <li>I really didnt notice any difference when I had my bikini line waxed.</li>
      <li>I put it on kind of thick the first time about 40 minutes before my appointment.</li>
      <li>It gives you more courage, this cream was a waste of money.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and use this every time I wax.</li>
      <li>In areas where I can take the pain and manage okay, I don&#x27;t use it I only use it on the parts that are TERRIBLE to wax, that I know for a fact will cause tremendous pain, and have thinner skin and are most vascular (so the cream sinks in better).</li>
      <li>product review is based on getting waxed with soft wax &amp; cloth strips.</li>
      <li>It made it worse honestly.</li>
      <li>We put it on before we left to go to the salon, an hour from where we live.</li>
      <li>It really takes the edge off, but it took me a little while to find the timing and amount that I needed for it to work well for me.</li>

<li> product review is based on getting waxed with soft wax &amp; cloth strips.</li>

<li> It really takes the edge off, but it took me a little while to find the timing and amount that I needed for it to work well for me.</li>
<li> a thick layer is totally needed for adequate penetration of enough of the active ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to this cream, I take an aspirin 20-30 min before I start</li>
<li> So, I&#x27;ve managed to save a lot of the cream and not wasted it on less worth-while areas.</li>
<li> It was a complete waste of money.</li>
<li> Personally I think it is the most painful thing EVER.</li>
<li> I used hard wax once &amp; the waxer couldn&#x27;t even complete the service.</li>
<li> How much this cream reduces the unpleasant sting was made apparent when I used it on only one leg.</li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way and if you use a few painkillers it actually decreases the amount of pain you feel by about 60%.</li>
<li> This may have helped a very little bit, but I was hoping to feel a big rduction in the pain.</li>
<li> The product is a thick white cream.</li>
<li> Once the cream is thick and white STOP!</li>
<li> It took edge off the pain slightly, I will keep using product.  </li>
<li> I have had my tube for a little over 6 months</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> Ill give it another try and come back to you!</li>
<li> So, I usually put the cream on when I start waxing, and by the time I get to the places with the cream, it&#x27;s been 20 min.</li>
<li> This is NOT based on people getting waxed with HARD WAX.</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream should be applied as a fairly thick layer and should not be rubbed in to the skin like lotion.</li>
<li> Definately apply a thick layer, as the instructions say.</li>
<li> The product works well, but is a little expensive.</li>
<li> I hardly even felt it!</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re waxing it&#x27;s gonna be uncomfortable cream or no cream.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, it did not minimize my pain at all.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> Nothing will make it so that waxing is painless, but this stuff does a good job taking the edge off if you can find the right timing for it. I use it for full bikini waxing. I put it on kind of thick the first time about 40 minutes before my appointment. I put on another bit of it when I arrive at my waxing appointment, about 10 minutes before the appointment. It really takes the edge off, but it took me a little while to find the timing and amount that I needed for it to work well for me.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t get waxed without this! It truly does work. I also have notice taking a pain reliever helps as well before going. :)</li>
    <li> I trusted this no scream cream for my second waxing appointment.  Big mistake. It didn&#x27;t help a bit.  The pain was as intense as the first time with no cream.  I followed all the directions too.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. My waxer recommended this product to me and it definitely helped with the pain a LOT. Before I use to take any pills I could get my hands on to help with the pain. I am Hispanic so our hair tends to be more thicker then most, so  getting waxed was bearable but not so pleasant. With this product now I can look forward to getting waxed and I no longer worry about being in pain. Don&#x27;t get me wrong you stick feel a sting but nothing compared to what you would feel with out it, including with the pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream should be applied as a fairly thick layer and should not be rubbed in to the skin like lotion. Once the cream is thick and white STOP! And let the cream absorb into the skin on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product review is based on getting waxed with soft wax &amp; cloth strips. This is NOT based on people getting waxed with HARD WAX. I have no idea why some people would use it for a Brazilian wax. Personally I think it is the most painful thing EVER. I used hard wax once &amp; the waxer couldn&#x27;t even complete the service.</li>
    <li> Use this for waxing my underarms and I feel almost nothing. This stuff is really great! Don&#x27;t wax without it.</li>
    <li> It did not work! One bit. It made it worse honestly. Just drink a beer or have a drink first. It gives you more courage, this cream was a waste of money. Very disappointed. But i waxed anyway and well worth the pain.</li>
    <li> The product works well, but is a little expensive. The product is a thick white cream. I used for self-waxing and it does what it says it should. It will not take away 100% of the pain, but it helps a lot. The pain can be reduced from a 9/10 to a 5/10 easily with this cream. The size of the tube and amount of product that you get is not proportional for the price. However, the effectiveness of the cream would make me repurchase at this price. I have had my tube for a little over 6 months and I still have a lot left. I use the cream only where I really need it and it will be effective (most vascular/ easiest for cream to penetrate). In areas where I can take the pain and manage okay, I don&#x27;t use it I only use it on the parts that are TERRIBLE to wax, that I know for a fact will cause tremendous pain, and have thinner skin and are most vascular (so the cream sinks in better). So, I&#x27;ve managed to save a lot of the cream and not wasted it on less worth-while areas. Definately apply a thick layer, as the instructions say. Do not try to be too sparing when applying the cream a thick layer is totally needed for adequate penetration of enough of the active ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to this cream, I take an aspirin 20-30 min before I start waxing.&lt;br /&gt;BIG TIP: I always clean the skin and let it dry and then apply the cream in a thick layer and *~*~*~*~*cover it in saran/plastic wrap~*~*~*~ to help the cream penetrate. I leave the cream on for about 20 minutes before I get to that area. So, I usually put the cream on when I start waxing, and by the time I get to the places with the cream, it&#x27;s been 20 min. Also, I leave the cream on until the VERY last minute. So, if I wax an area with cream, I wipe off the cream only where the strip will be and wax it, then I remove the cream on the next section so that the skin gets the most contact with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to use the product a couple of times before I figured out how to really get the most out of it, but hopefully if you buy this product what I&#x27;ve learned and shared will help you get the most out of it right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it five stars if the tube came in a bigger size or was cheaper.</li>
    <li> Whatever you do dont put this cream on and think that there will be no pain. I really didnt notice any difference when I had my bikini line waxed. Take 2 panadol 30 mins before its much better! My friend recommended this to me, she says it is brilliant so maybe it works for some. Ill give it another try and come back to you!</li>
    <li> It took edge off the pain slightly, I will keep using product.  I think it reduced pain by about 20%.</li>
    <li> This may have helped a very little bit, but I was hoping to feel a big rduction in the pain. Dissapointing.</li>
    <li> I use this product 45 minutes before each waxing appointment. A little bit goes a long way and if you use a few painkillers it actually decreases the amount of pain you feel by about 60%. Try to get as much as you can if you find it for a good price too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream so I could wax my own bikini area. It works amazingly if you follow the directions. I hardly even felt it!</li>
    <li> EH?  Didn&#x27;t do much for me but then again, the waxer was so fast that maybe there wouldn&#x27;t have been much pain anyway.</li>
    <li> thank you so very much it helped with the pain just took the edge of the pain off thank you so very much</li>
    <li> I have a lot of pain when I get my bikini and underarms sugared, and I was excited to try this product. Unfortunately, it did not minimize my pain at all. I applied it an hour before my appointment, and even put extra on about 30 minutes before...oh well.</li>
    <li> the product does work great and I definately recommend it. had brazilian wax yesterday, and even though it was not the best time of the month to wax ( middle of cycle), I barely felt any pain. It does like advertized: Relax and wax</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference honestly. If you&#x27;re waxing it&#x27;s gonna be uncomfortable cream or no cream. The longer you do it the easier it gets. If you are self-waxing, try making the paper strips smaller, it makes the pain more bearable.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and use this every time I wax. It is amazing how much it reduces the pain.</li>
    <li> I do not mind the pain of a Brazilian but I thought I would give this a try to compare for a friend. It did not work at all! There was no difference in waxing with the cream and waxing without it. It was a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> How much this cream reduces the unpleasant sting was made apparent when I used it on only one leg. The amount of discomfort more than doubled on the un-creamed leg.  I would never wax without this again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for I and my sisters first brazillians. We put it on before we left to go to the salon, an hour from where we live. It says on the instructions that the cream reaches effectiveness 30-40 minutes. It was not verry effective for me, I suspect, because I was not within the time limit. However it did work for my sister. I guess it depends on your body chemistry.</li>
