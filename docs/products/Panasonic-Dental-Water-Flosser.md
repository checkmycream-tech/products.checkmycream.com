      <li>and I have no complaints, love it.</li>
      <li>Having owned a Water Pik for years, I knew exactly how good they are.</li>
      <li>This is a quality product that is easy to use and provides satisfying results.  </li>
      <li>While the nozzle top is in the water, pressure isn&#x27;t felt so strong.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, easy to clean and effective.</li>
      <li>Sturdy and well manufactured (most important to me), can be charged at both 110v and 220v.</li>
      <li>The unit itself will fit in my medicine cabinet making it even more clutter-free.  </li>
      <li>The portability is great, but it can get old to stop and refill the tank.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The positive is that the resevoir is quick easy to refill and does a great job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>teeth are very fresh and gum condition is getting better every day so that now I don&#x27;t feel pain or bleed with flossing periodontal pocket with it.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to use and the process of flossing has become, for the very first time in my life, enjoyable and not a painful experience to be tolerated.</li>
      <li>Easy to travel with</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s in the box:&lt;br /&gt;An easy to remove tray slides out of the cardboard, and all contents are within, so no pieces to get from under/over/inside, it&#x27;s all compartmentalized for easy access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Works on both 110 and 220v, easy to learn how to use.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to charge.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s about the size of a electric toothbrush, and just about as easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Flip</li>
      <li>/&gt;Water pressure is quite strong</li>
      <li>then strong water flow&lt;br /&gt;get</li>
      <li>Love mine a life saver with my braces, no more bleeding gums, dental hygienist was happy!</li>
      <li>That it&#x27;s rechargable is a huge plus for me.  </li>
      <li>This one fit the bill</li>
      <li>Both sprays are a comfortable pressure.</li>
      <li>I’ve never used an electric water flosser before, but dental hygiene is important to me, so I decided to give it a try.  </li>
      <li>Filled with water, it makes it a bit heavier and</li>
      <li>This would be great for those with gum issues, and I wish we had had it when my daughter was in braces; flossing was a nightmare for her, and her gums were always red and inflamed.  </li>
      <li>I can put the charger in some out-of-the-way place, leaving the vanity space free of clutter.  </li>
      <li>put the unit on the charging stand - it fits securely onto two plastic</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to note that teeth do not absorb water, they repel it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall a very powerful, compact and well engineered water flosser.</li>
      <li>I refill the tank 4-5 times to clean all teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I refill the tank 4-5 times to clean all teeth.  </li>
      <li>My teeth feel and look nice and clean, and my gums are nice and pink.  </li>
      <li>Very strong pressure water goes through between teeth even normal flosser won&#x27;t go in.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;lamp does not go off even when charging ends&amp;#34; so you&#x27;ll just have to set a 15 hour timer if you want a full</li>
      <li>However, if you do a quick job you can get away with 1 or maybe 2 fill ups.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I love this water flosser and would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>(the high is more effective than the only setting on the Waterpik), and the more gently options are there if I need them.</li>
      <li>The battery life seems okay for normal usage as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A well engineered and powerful water flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The water tank provides about 30 seconds worth of water, though this depends on the mode you are using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So when this item came up for offer on Vine it looked worth a shot.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It comes with two different heads that have resting spots on the charger so you and another can have your own water bit,</li>
      <li>This is a very handy little water flosser.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s right, 15.</li>
      <li>Handy &amp; easy to use, just a little under-powered.</li>
      <li>The weight of the flosser is heavier when filled with water, and expect to refill the tank more than once in a single flossing session.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this water flosser for the past week with great results.</li>
      <li>And the soft, sure-grip area is great for use with wet hands.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very low-maintenance and super convenient.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s certainly adequate, but really pales in comparison.  </li>
      <li>The water container does empty pretty quickly when using, so you will need to stop and refill frequently during cleanings, but I liked the products I received free from the Vine program to sample.</li>
      <li>move the nozzel in the gaps of our teeth on the bottom and top to remove meat, pop corn cernals and the like from our teeth in short order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am pretty thorough with my water flossing.</li>
      <li>for exactly 1 hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed the unit from the charging stand and attached one of the nozzles then stuck it in my mouth and turned it on.</li>
      <li>, I took it off from mouth first...</li>
      <li>or more specifically &amp;#34;automatic universal voltage&amp;#34; from 100-240v.</li>
      <li>Well, actually, decades are more like it.</li>
      <li>instead of tun it off first in mouth&lt;</li>
      <li>My wife who routinely flosses had no blood even on her first usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have found it&#x27;s easier to do this in the kitchen, as the sink is bigger and it gives me more room to tilt the unit so I can fill it up all the way.</li>
      <li>and I was able to use it for both of these tests after only charging for 1 hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The water pressure is good enough to dislodge particles and left my mouth feeling fresh.  </li>
      <li>is even more strong and I don&#x27;t understand who can use such strong sharp water pressure in mouth.&lt;br</li>

    <li> A well engineered and powerful water flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like using it, it&#x27;s fairly compact and the unit with charger stand doesn&#x27;t take up much room on my smallish bathroom counter. Water pressure is extremely powerful - especially in JET mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I really like - you can charge the unit on its charger stand, with the water tank removed while it dries overnight. I find this pretty useful, since I like to take out the water tank after every use so it can dry well (though you don&#x27;t have to do this, you can just simply leave the water opening flap open while charging overnight too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually find I refill the water tank about 2 - 4 times per use. I am pretty thorough with my water flossing. However, if you do a quick job you can get away with 1 or maybe 2 fill ups. The water tank provides about 30 seconds worth of water, though this depends on the mode you are using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filling the tank is super easy, as the water opening flap simply flips open and water fills under your faucet. I have found it&#x27;s easier to do this in the kitchen, as the sink is bigger and it gives me more room to tilt the unit so I can fill it up all the way. In the bathroom my sink is small so I couldn&#x27;t tilt the unit all the way down to fill it up to the max. Works either way though, it&#x27;s not a big issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I gave it 4 stars only because the water tank could be slightly bigger, though filling it up is super fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very powerful, compact and well engineered water flosser.</li>
    <li> This is a very handy little water flosser.  It is lightweight and untethered which makes it really easy to use.  The water pressure is good enough to dislodge particles and left my mouth feeling fresh.  I am tempted to put Listerine in it but I won&#x27;t, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used a water flosser before so I have nothing to compare it to, but it does the job.  It is very sloppy, as one would expect with a water gun for your mouth, but I just lean over the sink to keep mess to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with a charge so I could use it right away which was really appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two different heads that have resting spots on the charger so you and another can have your own water bit, one blue one white to tell them apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty loud, so don&#x27;t attampt to use this on a young kid without warning first ;)</li>
    <li> This is a quality product that is easy to use and provides satisfying results.  It comes with two heads that my wife and I can each enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We move the nozzel in the gaps of our teeth on the bottom and top to remove meat, pop corn cernals and the like from our teeth in short order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only draw back that I have is the need to refill the tank at least once during the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positive is that the resevoir is quick easy to refill and does a great job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product and my best guess is that you will too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> We bought several waterpiks at the recommendation of our dentist--as an alternative to flossing.  They work great but they&#x27;re notorious bathroom real estate hogs.  So when this item came up for offer on Vine it looked worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s certainly adequate, but really pales in comparison.  First of all, between the charger and the size of the flosser--to accomodate the water well--it too takes up a decent amount of room.  More importantly, it&#x27;s not as powerful as the waterpik and the water reservoir is shallow enough that you may have to refill it during use.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, easy to clean and effective. The water container does empty pretty quickly when using, so you will need to stop and refill frequently during cleanings, but I liked the products I received free from the Vine program to sample. The unit is easy to hold and use for the average adult, but a young child may have some difficulty gripping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great that its easily washable and the water container can be cleaned to prevent contamination. I believe this unit would be an important addition to anyone&#x27;s daily dental hygiene routine.</li>
    <li> This Panasonic Cordless Water Flosser with rechargeable dock is the perfect size. It&#x27;s about the size of a electric toothbrush, and just about as easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Flip open the cap on the body of the flosser, and fill it with water. There are two settings for the water spray; jet and soft. Both sprays are a comfortable pressure. The water tank can be removed from the body of the flosser to make it easier to wash out.&lt;br /&gt;The Flosser comes with two nozzles, although I couldn&#x27;t find and substantial difference between the two.&lt;br /&gt;The charging dock is small enough as to not overtake your vanity.&lt;br /&gt;My only con would be that the water take is quite small, so refilling may be necessary. This is a very nice unit.</li>
    <li> My parents used the original WaterPik years ago, and we have a different brand of corded water flosser upon recommendation from my husband&#x27;s dentist. It takes up a ton of room on the counter, as it has two bodies and two heads. I will be replacing that flosser with this one because it&#x27;s so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 3 settings. My husband has sensitive teeth. The soft works well for him. I personally like the regular, and there is also a JET setting to really blast stubborn stuck foods. My teeth are very close together so I&#x27;ve needed to use it a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two nozzles, of different colors, for unique users. The entire body can be washed, which is really fantastic. The tank is easy to fill (and empty between uses, if you desire) and it doesn&#x27;t look like there are hidden tubes where water could stagnate and grow bacteria unbeknownst to the user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaints:&lt;br /&gt;1) the JET setting sprays water on my face as it bounces off my teeth and mouth. But it does dislodge food well.&lt;br /&gt;2) the water tank is small enough that if you are thorough, you&#x27;ll need to refill it during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I love this water flosser and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Not long ago, I finally gave up my electric toothbrush, as the rechargeable battery died for the second time. I&#x27;ve found that using a good old fashioned toothbrush works just fine, and may even wear down my tooth enamel less than the electric did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I had never before tried a water floss device, and when Amazon Vine offered one, I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works like a dream. Like another reviewer here, I keep it plugged in an out of the way place, and store the unit out of sight when not using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I too like the regular speed and find soft too fine a touch. The jet stream, as it were, is too jet age for my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device cleans well, and overall I give it a high grade.</li>
    <li> Its just as they said it would be!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time. Have been using it for a couple of months already and I&#x27;m very happy!!! Works perfectly well, comfortable and easy to use (do remember to keep your mouth closed when flossing!). Sturdy and well manufactured (most important to me), can be charged at both 110v and 220v. Teeth and gums look and feel like they just came back from a thorough cleansing at the dentist!</li>
    <li> For its size it does an excellent job. Easy to travel with</li>
    <li> Update Mar 23, 2015.&lt;br /&gt;1st review was 3 stars however now I can give 5.&lt;br /&gt;I trained myself for using it every day once a day(usually at night) for about 2 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;Water pressure is quite strong but I found how to control it, it can be controlled by how much water you keep&lt;br /&gt;in your mouth. I think basically it is used not keeping your mouth widely open like looking teeth on mirror&lt;br /&gt;while brushing your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;How I trained myself.&lt;br /&gt;1st, Completely close your mouth with putting the nozzle in to your mouth and feel how the pain of water pressure&lt;br /&gt;  can be controlled. While the nozzle top is in the water, pressure isn&#x27;t felt so strong. By draining water from mouth&lt;br /&gt;  little by little, the pain can be controlled.&lt;br /&gt;2nd, Put it in your mouth without switch on, open mouth and look at mirror, and see how you need to turn the nozzle&lt;br /&gt;  by right thumb to properly aim at periodontal pocket.(I am a right hander)&lt;br /&gt;  Once this can be done well, you can imagine direction of nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let&#x27;s try with turning it on, face down, slightly open mouth and control the draining amount from the water, move the nozzle imagining where it is aiming at, now you feel water pressure so that you can also feel where the nozzle is and water hitting. then just keep doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jet is a little different, when using Jet, spot the nozzle between teeth without switch on, hold it well and turn on. Very strong pressure water goes through between teeth even normal flosser won&#x27;t go in. It&#x27;s grate but never shoot gum or periodontal pocket directly, you might get kinda injured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was mess when I used it very early time but now I can use it quite cleanly even busy morning and teeth are very fresh and gum condition is getting better every day so that now I don&#x27;t feel pain or bleed with flossing periodontal pocket with it. I got braced on my teeth but teeth are cleaner than before getting braced.  My wife and daughter told my bad breath was gone.&lt;br /&gt;(I brush my teeth before using it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;First review&lt;br /&gt;I got bracing on my teeth a few days ago and struggled with flossing my teeth every day and found this product.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans my braced teeth quite well but be careful for strong sharp water pressure and splash all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very power full even &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; , it is quite painful when water hit gum or tongue directly, but still ok.&lt;br /&gt;Regular power is also quite strong, don&#x27;t aim at periodontal pocket directly, (I don&#x27;t recommend it) it&#x27;s quite painful.&lt;br /&gt;I have to be careful where I aiming at, not directly the pocket, it must be lower part of tooth. then strong water flow&lt;br /&gt;get into the pocket and flash the pocket.&lt;br /&gt;Jet is even more strong and I don&#x27;t understand who can use such strong sharp water pressure in mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Manual said don&#x27;t use it on periodontal pocket. Jet is to go between teeth, not for between tooth&lt;br /&gt;and gum.(never try!) It&#x27;s kinda danger using JET it in mouth. even shooting my hand, it&#x27;s quite painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s human nature, when it&#x27;s pain, I took it off from mouth first... instead of tun it off first in mouth&lt;br /&gt;and take it off..so when it came out from mouth, it&#x27;s usually aiming at my face. it&#x27;s not so safe if it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;hit an eye directly.(maybe better use it with safety glasses??) anyway but it is that much quite strong.&lt;br /&gt;Need a little bit of training to get use to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Power button is press-ON, press-off. not press &amp; hold for ON.  Press &amp; hold for ON would be better I believe.&lt;br /&gt;then I could place the nozzle first and just press for short time easy hitting and save limited water in tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is NiMH battery powered, not user replaceable but manual shows how to take them off for recycle so actually&lt;br /&gt;it can be replaceable but water proof may not function correctly if installation is not good.&lt;br /&gt;100-240V AC power for charging.&lt;br /&gt;Body has no metal contact for charging, so I guess it is using inductive charging system so that it takes 15hrs&lt;br /&gt;for full charge and allows 15min operation.(sound so short for charging time but long enough for actual use)&lt;br /&gt;Water tank is not big enough for me to clean even only my bottom teeth with soft&lt;br /&gt;pressure. I refill the tank 4-5 times to clean all teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be ready to splash all over your washbasin, mirror, sink whatever around you are facing to.&lt;br /&gt;It makes mess all over. It&#x27;s 100% water proof so that it&#x27;s better use while taking shower, better&lt;br /&gt;train yourself using it in shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 2 nozzles, charger, charger mount screws.(I don&#x27;t use it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe the way advertising it will give cleaner impression for people but when it&#x27;s using it,&lt;br /&gt;really splash all over. so I give 3 starts. but it clears my teeth very well. not as tiring as flossing.sound so short for charging time but long enough for actual use) Water tank is not big enough for me to clean even only my bottom teeth with soft pressure.

    <li> What&#x27;s in the box:&lt;br /&gt;An easy to remove tray slides out of the cardboard, and all contents are within, so no pieces to get from under/over/inside, it&#x27;s all compartmentalized for easy access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Instruction manual presented in English and Spanish&lt;br /&gt;* The unit base (the large part of the device that contains the battery pack, water reservoir, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;* Two nozzles (detached, which you will attach as you put it together - note that one has a blue ring and one has a white ring so you can swap&lt;br /&gt;them out for two people using the same device in the household - beyond that you&#x27;ll have to get additional nozzles but keep reading - I think&lt;br /&gt;think you should bother)&lt;br /&gt;* Charging stand (it&#x27;s got a wide footprint, so hopefully you have bathroom counter space for it because it was too big to fit on my&lt;br /&gt;pedestal sink; the stand has two holes for storing the two nozzles when they are not attached to the unit base)&lt;br /&gt;* Two tiny screws for mounting the stand (I didn&#x27;t use these because I don&#x27;t plan to mount the charging stand)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started by flipping open the plastic cover on the water reservoir and filling. It doesn&#x27;t hold a huge amount of water, maybe a cup or less. I&lt;br /&gt;then put the unit on the charging stand - it fits securely onto two plastic prongs.&lt;br /&gt;The guide recommends you charge for 15 hours. That&#x27;s right, 15. And you won&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s done charging because the guide advises that &amp;#34;the&lt;br /&gt;lamp does not go off even when charging ends&amp;#34; so you&#x27;ll just have to set a 15 hour timer if you want a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This feels incredibly excessive to me given that 15 hours of charging only nets you 15 minutes of operating time. Seems like the battery&lt;br /&gt;technology in this device must be from the 80&#x27;s. I didn&#x27;t wait 15 hours before testing (because quite frankly that&#x27;s ridiculous) and so I let it&lt;br /&gt;charge for exactly 1 hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed the unit from the charging stand and attached one of the nozzles then stuck it in my mouth and turned it on. It began a rapid-fire machine-gun spray into my mouth - with three speed settings which are selectable by pressing the associated button (it cycles through fast/normal/slow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now let&#x27;s talk about the mess. Although I was holding my head with mouth facing down toward the sink, water went everywhere. All over the&lt;br /&gt;sink basin and sides, the mirror in front of me, the faucet, and all down the unit base. It&#x27;s important to note that teeth do not absorb water, they repel it. Water sprayed everywhere. I then closed my mouth a bit more (like the instruction manual says) and my mouth began to fill with water. I opened it to let the water pour out into the sink and again water sprayed everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re supposed to have your mouth pretty much closed when using this, but at some point you HAVE to open your mouth and let the water drain&lt;br /&gt;out or you&#x27;ll have a mouthful of water. If you don&#x27;t turn the device off every time you do that you&#x27;re going to have jets of water spraying and&lt;br /&gt;bouncing off your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the mess it created, the device is NOT lightweight - which I suppose is good since it only has a water reserve for approximately 35&lt;br /&gt;seconds of use before you have to turn it off and refill. Quite frankly I was done with the product after less than 15 seconds. My teeth and gums did feel like they&#x27;d had a massage - which I suppose is a positive aspect to all of this, but what a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I decided to take a break and give it another try. I refilled the reservoir and this time completely closed my mouth after inserting the nozzle. I turned it on and ran it all around the inside of my mouth and opened my lips just barely to let the water pour out. It still made a mess all down the unit base and my hand, but not as much splashing around the sink. Still I was left with cleanup to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the device is clunky, noisy, cumbersome, and messy. The instruction to charge it for 15 hours seems excessive and I was able to use it for both of these tests after only charging for 1 hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just can&#x27;t see myself using this product on a regular basis. It takes up too much space on my pedestal sink, is not lightweight or comfortable to hold in my hand, and makes too much of a mess during what I consider to be reasonable use. I&#x27;ll just stick with my toothbrush, floss, and Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars for this one.o charge it for 15 hours seems excessive and I was able to use it for both of these tests after only charging for 1 hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just can&#x27;t see myself using this product on a regular basis.

    <li> Love mine a life saver with my braces, no more bleeding gums, dental hygienist was happy!</li>
    <li> My dentist has been trying to get me to floss on a regular basis for years. Well, actually, decades are more like it. But I hate the way dental floss smells and my gums are so sensitive that they always end up bleeding after flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cordless water flosser from Panasonic has been amazing in getting me to floss every day. It is very easy to use and the process of flossing has become, for the very first time in my life, enjoyable and not a painful experience to be tolerated. It&#x27;s important to adjust the warmth of the water you use to fill in the flosser because if the water is too cold or too warm, that will make flossing unpleasant. Other than that, however, it&#x27;s the easiest product to use. It&#x27;s very low-maintenance and super convenient.</li>
    <li> Handy &amp; easy to use, just a little under-powered.</li>
    <li> No real complaints; I only wish it had a slightly larger water capacity (like 50% more). But that might make it too heavy. It works very well for me. I have a tooth that needs a crown to seal a food trap on my gum line, but can&#x27;t have dental work done until 6 months after my quad-bypass. I don&#x27;t think it could get the food out with floss, since it is literally in a crack between my gum &amp; tooth, so I bought this and it cleans it quite well.</li>
    <li> I just LOVE this cordless water flosser. Works on both 110 and 220v, easy to learn how to use. Gives range of pressure and is a welcome addition to any dental hygiene program.</li>
    <li> Though I don&#x27;t like electric toothbrushes, I do like having a water flosser, but the one I have is cumbersome, and takes up a lot of real estate in my very small bathroom.  This one fit the bill so I jumped at the chance to try it, and I have to say I&#x27;m glad I did.  That it&#x27;s rechargable is a huge plus for me.  I can put the charger in some out-of-the-way place, leaving the vanity space free of clutter.  The unit itself will fit in my medicine cabinet making it even more clutter-free.  High marks for space saving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The regular speed works very well for me.  Soft is a bit too gentle, and jet a bit too hard for anything but a really stubborn piece of food.  And the soft, sure-grip area is great for use with wet hands.  My only quibble is that the reservoir doesn&#x27;t hold enough water to get me through my whole mouth on the regular setting.  It&#x27;s not a huge problem, but if it was just a touch bigger, it might not be a problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes apart for easy cleaning, and there are two color-coded nozzles for different family members.  All things considered, this really is a winner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this water flosser for the past week with great results. I hate flossing -- I will gargle mouth wash, brush my teeth twice daily, but I just can&#x27;t get into sticking string into my mouth between my teeth. This inevitably leads to the dentist bothering me each time I go to visit about how I need to floss and how it causes my gums to bleed because I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter this cordless water flosser. My first use resulted in the expected heavy bleeding from my gums but over the past week it&#x27;s really stopped happening. My wife who routinely flosses had no blood even on her first usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re supposed to remove the water after use to keep it from getting gross and full of bacteria which has never been a problem as I usually have to refill it once or twice during my flossing due to how much the jet mode uses. The battery life seems okay for normal usage as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I think it&#x27;s great and I have no complaints, love it.</li>
    <li> The only drawback to this water flosser is that the water tank is not very big and does require refilling a couple of times during use.  I like that it is cordless and rather compact so it doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the counter.  The jet setting is quite powerful and has caused my gums to bleed (in a spot that normal flossing does the same), but it works well for getting stuck stuff out of my wisdom teeth.</li>
    <li> The only major shortcomings of the EW1211A are it&#x27;s relatively small water supply and, ironically, it&#x27;s somewhat prodigious size (to accommodate the water supply it does possess).  These short comings must be balanced, of course, with the fact that the user isn&#x27;t tethered to a stationary unit and the entire device, including its small charging stand, is relatively portable.  The EW1211A has a fairly powerful action, but it&#x27;s simply not the equal of the non-cordless units I&#x27;ve used.  It does have three useful settings -- soft, regular, and jet (which adds a pulsating feel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless portability is very important to you, I simply cannot recommend this over a standard, tethered alternative.  I&#x27;d rather have a larger reservoir of water (I had to refill this unit at least three times each use) and a more powerful spray, and, in the long run, I think most would agree.</li>
    <li> I previously have used a Waterpik flosser with the tank and I wanted something a little less clunky and easier to clean, so I went with this model. It IS easier to handle and clean - you only have a small tank compared to a large one with the Waterpik and it&#x27;s easy to charge. But when the instructions tell you to put the nozzle into your mouth - you really want to do that. I first turned it on expecting it to work similarly to my Waterpik flosser and it sprayed out all over the bathroom. Even across the entire room!! It has 3 settings - jet, air regular and air soft. The pressure comes out with such force that the only setting I can use it on is the air soft which is actually meant to &amp;#34;massage your gums&amp;#34;. I am afraid if I tried any other setting, I wouldnt have any gums left! That being said, the lowest setting still seemed to do a decent job of flushing particles out from my teeth and gums, so I will continue to use it and just be careful to start it up in my mouth and keep it there until I turn it off!!</li>
    <li> This takes some getting used to, but just remember to lean into the sink to avoid splashing.  The weight of the flosser is heavier when filled with water, and expect to refill the tank more than once in a single flossing session.  I use the regular speed as part of my routine, but the jet is more forceful which I only reserve for stubbornly stuck food.  The noise is a little louder than my electric toothbrush but nothing that&#x27;s overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 heads included with this package, so you can share with another family member.  The portability is great, but it can get old to stop and refill the tank.  I can see this being really great for anyone with braces.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think that a cordless water flosser could possibly stand a chance against a Water Pik. Having owned a Water Pik for years, I knew exactly how good they are. Unfortunately, in a small bathroom, it&#x27;s the size of a tank on the vanity. Water Piks are just BIG, there&#x27;s no getting around it. Or no easy way to store it, cause it&#x27;s not a lightweight. I just thought an ugly water flosser on my vanity was the price you pay for good dental hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic rechargeable just knocked my socks off! I didn&#x27;t expect much from anything cordless. The device fits nicely in the hand, and it isn&#x27;t overly cumbersome, seeing as how the water reservoir is contained in your hand via the device. Filled with water, it makes it a bit heavier and thus a bit ungainly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just expected the water to dribble out, but wow! This thing is amazing! The burst of water took me by surprise...if anything, it was definitely on a par with the power I get from my trusty ol&#x27; Water Pik. Incredible power from a handheld water flosser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that, if you&#x27;re like me and do a lot of water flossing, you&#x27;ll be refilling this several times in one session. That&#x27;s OK, though. it was easy enough to do, it&#x27;s just that when you get into the Water Pik rhythm, you hate to break it off for a gadget refill. Your arms may also feel a bit tired; you are, now, holding the entire water flossing system in your hand, vs. having most of it tethered to a reservoir on your vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all things considered, I&#x27;d definitely recommend the Panasonic Water Flosser. It shocked me with its power; the other details - refilling the thing and the weight - I&#x27;m sure I can get used to for the joy of not seeing a Water Pik tank on my size-limited vanity!</li>
    <li> Great water flosser!! Only warning - if you have it on hard setting, you will get a shower! This is a compact unit, so takes up little space on the counter. Rechargeable - which is very nice! Very simple to use and clean. Has two heads (you can buy more if needed), can be rinsed under running water, and water chamber will go in the dishwasher - that is a real positive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, a great addition to home dental care!</li>
    <li> This is the first water flosser I have owned, although several family members have the bulkier style ones from another manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;While unsightly, the older flossers do the job but never inspired me to purchase one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;But the Panasonic Cordless Water Flosser is different.&lt;br /&gt;The space saving design fits neatly on a countertop or even in a medicine cabinet. It is slightly larger than a battery operated toothbrush with the water reservoir easily accessed on the back of the unit. I have fairly small hands but still found this very comfortable to hold and operate.&lt;br /&gt;Because using a water flosser is new to me, I took my time experimenting with the best way to keep any overspray to a minimum. I found the regular mode the best for everyday use and the jet mode good for removing particularly difficult foods like popcorn or corn on the cob. I do need to refill the water reservoir midway during use but that&#x27;s a trade off I don&#x27;t mind for the space saving and portable design.&lt;br /&gt;I especially like that this is dual voltage, or more specifically &amp;#34;automatic universal voltage&amp;#34; from 100-240v. The compact size fits easily in a toiletry kit and makes this ideal for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic Cordless Water Flosser is nothing like the flossers that my parents own, and that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
    <li> The Water flosser is ok... but, I have sensitive teeth and if the water is a little on the cool side, the blast from the flosser is uncomfortable...  the speed of the water jet is also difficult to get adjusted to.  So, unfortunately, I have not been able to get much positive use out of it.</li>
    <li> I previously owned a similar model Waterpik who&#x27;s rechargeable battery died in just over a year.  After reading many reviews saying this was very common and would only happen again and again, I wanted to try something else.  This Panasonic was a great alternative!  I hope to get a much longer batter life from it, but in the mean time I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that it&#x27;s already a far superior product.  The swiveling head is a great feature over the Waterpik.  I like the adjustable water pressure (the high is more effective than the only setting on the Waterpik), and the more gently options are there if I need them. The charging stand is much more convenient than other brands.  Has a sturdy, good build quality feel.  So far, 10 out of 10 would buy this again and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This water flosser does a good job.  The only drawback is that the water tank doesn&#x27;t hold enough water and I have to re-fill it while I am flossing.</li>
    <li> Resovoir reqires frequent refilling.</li>
    <li> I’ve never used an electric water flosser before, but dental hygiene is important to me, so I decided to give it a try.  I was really surprised by the charging time required, 15 hours or 23 hours before first use, which I guess means this thing needs to live on its charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once charged, I gave it a try.  In theory, it’s not difficult to use, but it certainly isn’t for the uncoordinated, of which I may be a member.  It’s going to take me a while to learn how to use this water flosser without spraying water all over my bathroom or having water dribbling down my chin.  The former is totally my fault; I forgot to keep my mouth closed.  There may not be much help for the latter; all that water has to go somewhere.  I also had to refill the water tank a second time before I was finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the three different settings: Jet for cleaning in between teeth, Air In Regular for cleaning between the teeth and gums, and Air In Soft for massaging gums.  My teeth feel and look nice and clean, and my gums are nice and pink.  This would be great for those with gum issues, and I wish we had had it when my daughter was in braces; flossing was a nightmare for her, and her gums were always red and inflamed.  I also like that it comes with two nozzles, one which is plain white, the other with a blue strip around the bottom to differentiate them so that two different family members can use the water flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite my ineptitude, I was able to effectively clean in between my teeth with the Panasonic Cordless Water Flosser, and I’d definitely recommend it to those who have trouble flossing and/or gum issues.</li>
