<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the scent as always. Will definitely purchase more soon. Afraid of running out. Shipping was faster than expected which of course is not a bad thing. I enjoy how its my usual go to smell that sometimes the scents lingers on my pillow and clothes although its been washed. Would completely recommend it to someone who is looking for a scent that last long with a mild mature musk.</li>
    <li> Always get complements on the scent of this oil.</li>
    <li> Best clean FRESH smell ever!!!!  People will stop you and ask what your wearing!!  They will ask how they can get it.  That is how I found it!</li>
    <li> Wish this came in a larger size!  I get more compliments when I have this on.  I mix it in with my un scented lotion and use it all over.  Almost ready to order my next bottle.</li>
    <li> I literally got 3 time the amount of purfume for half the money I usually spend in local stores for the same purfume and that&#x27;s with shipping included! I was able to fill 6 roll-on smaller bottles with some still left over!</li>
    <li> I love this scent. One bottle lasts me a year so even though to some it may seem high priced, it is well worth it. You only need a little bit and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Not as potent as the smaller Egyptian goddess oils I was very disappointed it barley smelled of anything and whatever little scent it had did NOT last all day like the smaller version, Id suggest just get the smaller one, I will never buy this perfume again :(</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of this oil, however, I think they put too much base oil and not enough essential. It does kind of smell like the base oil more than the fragrance oil.  I will not purchase the large bottle again, I will stick with the small roll-on.</li>
    <li> It has a very weak scent. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Product is ok! It has a great scent sometimes &amp; sometimes when i go to use it smells like some plain oily smell.... Wish it wasn&#x27;t like this because i REALLY Love this scent!!</li>
    <li> I adore this sexy, subtle and very feminine scent.&lt;br /&gt;For the adult woman.&lt;br /&gt;Chronologically and mentally.</li>
    <li> The Egyptian Goddess perfume oil smells amazing in the bottle. It is so disappointing that Auric makes it so weak. It is only detectable when you are applying and the scent is gone in a couple minutes. Unfortunately I would not purchase again because it is so diluted. Why put oil on yourself with little scent. The whole idea with fragrance is that it is fragrant. Pump up the scent to oil ratio and I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this oil... it is by far the BEST Egyptian Goddess out there, all others are sub par! However, I was hoping for a perfume spray, not an oil based based product. The sent doesn&#x27;t seem to last long enough, at least not to me. Still, the essential oil blend is a more natural choice to perfumes and very moisturizing. I love it!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t ever really used perfume oil before so I don&#x27;t have much to base this on but I am a major perfume junkie and I have to say I LOVE this!  It smells beautiful.  It is a mixture of sweet and sexy.  The scent is noticeable but only up close, there isn&#x27;t an overpowering scent which I really like.  The oil seems to have a thicker texture which I like and it soaks into the skin quickly and easily.  I will definitely be purchasing more of this when I run out.  It is a great price for the size of the bottle, it makes your skin soft, and it smells great.  My Husband even liked it and asked what I was wearing and he is not a perfume guy.  Overall this is a great deal and a great purchase and I am so glad I decided to try it out!  The bottle is very nice also, very sturdy and pretty.  I think this is a great summer scent for all ages.  If you love soft, feminine scents than this is for you!  Plus the price is so reasonable even if you don&#x27;t like it you wouldn&#x27;t be out that much money.  I can&#x27;t see how someone wouldn&#x27;t like this though, it is a lovely fragrance.  I am planning to buy it for my Mom and Sister!</li>
    <li> I was recently on vacation and was in a store that sold Egyptian Goddess. I tried the tester and really loved the scent but didn&#x27;t purchase the product. While walking to a few other stores, I realized that I did want to buy it after all, so I returned to the store and purchased the roll on oil. However, after getting it home, I could not smell any scent in the one I purchased. I saw this on line and decided to try it..thought that the one I bought might have been a \\&quot;dud\\&quot;. However, I am finding that there is no scent to this one, either. Nothing like the tester I tried in the store. :(</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting an aresol perfume, which probably would of spread the smell better. But to be honest with you, it has a tiny bit of smell going on! It is nice and it goes away within seconds. I would not of bought it if I had seen it on display in a store.</li>
    <li> Received this product broken</li>
    <li> Very nice smell and lingers for long. However I feel that very low quantity of the essential oil is added to the filler oil making the scent very faint. The bottle was not packed in a box and was sent in bubble wrapped envelope unlike the previous shipment which was better packaged.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this smell.  I have been using it for years now.  It isn&#x27;t overpowering, but one thing I noticed with the oil is that it gets stronger the warmer you get.  It is a clean fresh but very feminine smell.  I have tried one other Egyptian musk, but it didn&#x27;t quite have the feminine notes that this one has and was runny.  This one is very thick and I usually mix it with water and spray it on in a spray bottle then rub it in.  Really, I cannot get tired of the scent.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is not for me.  The odor is too strong even for layering or mixing.  This scent strongly attracts men or strongly repels them. Many men tend to be a little too sexually aggressive around this scent.  I think it smells like bad body odor.</li>
    <li> I first purchased Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess in the roll-on form on eBay a few years back and fell in love with it. Of all the Egyptian musks out there, this one is definitely one of the best (Abdul Kareem Egyptian Musk is another). When I ran out of my roll-on a few weeks ago, I decided to splurge and buy this bottle and I am glad I did. This is the warmest, yummiest scent and I really love the fact that it is not flowery, overpowering or offensive. This is not one of those scents that will knock someone over when you come into a room. Rather, it is a scent that most people cannot smell until they are close to you or you walk by them which is really a perfume&#x27;s purpose. In short, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While other reviewers stated their dissatisfaction with the weaker smell of the larger bottle, I did not find this to be the case with the particular bottle I received. The bottle I received has the exact same potency and staying power as the roll-on. I will continue to repurchase Egyptian Goddess.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product. The perfume oil smells divine and I received my shipment promptly. A good company to do business with. Buy without hesitation.</li>
    <li> This is the best value for the money! It&#x27;s easier to apply and is the exact same scent as in the rollerball.I apply this allover my body after a shower and it radiates throughout the day.A beautiful,if not bewitching fragrance,It&#x27;s related to the Egyptian Musk family of fragrances for sure and Cleopatra herself and pharaohs are said to have worn Egyptian Musk.</li>
    <li> All I can say is I am obsessed, I have been using it for years and i love it. I have friends who use it too and i never knew it was the same stuff, but it smells different but amazing on them too.</li>
    <li> When you open the bottle it smells great, but once you put it on it just smells like oil. I don&#x27;t know what the manufacturer has done to the product that has ruined a great product. I&#x27;ve tried the roll-on as well and same thing :( very disappointed.</li>
    <li> As I usually ignore negative ratings, I ordered this larger size of Egyptian Goddess perfume oil and am very pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I find the larger size to have the same strength as the roll on oils I have ordered from different vendors.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I received was NOT cut with filler oil and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;Egyptian Goddess is not supposed to hit you over the head.  It is supposed to be a subtle but long lasting fragrance which&lt;br /&gt;my bottle received is.&lt;br /&gt;Glad to have the larger size handy for refill my smaller roll ons when I use them up.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend the large bottle.</li>
    <li> My go to scent, I will never wear anything else.  I am always getting compliments on how wonderful I smell.</li>
    <li> I am a regular purchaser of the 1/3oz roll-on.  Thought I would finally splurge for this larger bottle. I will be able to wear it everyday at this size and not save it for &#x27;special&#x27;, but I am slightly disappointed in the level of fragrance.  It&#x27;s less than what I&#x27;m used to.  The scent is there, just lighter.  I love wearing this scent.  I don&#x27;t notice it after it&#x27;s on and I always get complimented.  I will be interested to see how this bottle pans out.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous scent! I have read the negative reviews from other seller&#x27;s reviews about this particular oil and I recommend curious buyers pay attention to the positive feedback, and buy it from this seller. Ladies, you cannot douse yourselves in this oil. A little goes along way. Its a subtle scent that strengthen over time with your body heat.     So women who need immediate gratification of an over bearing scent with hope it lasts throughout the day, this scent is not for you.. This a scent for controlled women who like to tease men with an alluring essence, and can walk away from their stimulated inquisitiveness.     Think this is an overrated review??? Try it</li>
    <li> A 3 heart score from me...this products smell is so unique.  It cannot be found just anywhere.  I enjoy the subtle smell it offers the wearer, when you walk into a room, you know your there, so do others, as this unique scent carries with you all day long.  I will re-order more &#x27;</li>
    <li> I already wrote a review about the fragrance itself...sexy, subtel, seductive, very feminine and mature (but not mature like old lady..oohhhhh no!) It&#x27;s also very versatile, it can be worn every day and be appropriate for every setting. But anyway, I just wanted to say how great it is that they have this larger bottle.  It&#x27;s a nice savings compared to buying the roll ons.  I still have a roll on for my purse though.  I&#x27;m obsessed with this perfume!  Auric Blends in general have really made some truly delicious scents, and such high quality oils for so little money! Does it get much better than that? I think not.</li>
    <li> Great scent at a good price. Ordered it more than once. Larger size that lasts alot longer then the smaller version.</li>
    <li> I have bought a number of Auric blends in the past years.&lt;br /&gt;I was buying the smaller vials and the Scent didn&#x27;t seem quite what it was originally so I decided to switch to the auric blend perfume.&lt;br /&gt;well, the same thing is happening.&lt;br /&gt;It appears its very little scent and LOTS of oil.&lt;br /&gt;I have read other reviews and I don&#x27;t seem to be alone in my findings.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad for when I wear it and the scent is there a bit I get many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;I am tired though of not getting a better more lasting product for my money.&lt;br /&gt;too bad the manufacturer continues to water down this product.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed once again</li>
    <li> Love it...My wife has had many favorable comments... The aroma definitely evolves over time... The longer the wearer has it on the better it gets. It&#x27;s intoxicating and really gets the heart pumping for me...!!</li>
    <li> Maybe they&#x27;ve changed the amount of perfume since some of the earlier comments? I got my bottle tonight and used just a drop of it in the tub. My husband complained that it was smelling up the other room. Ha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Divine smell. First musk I&#x27;ve purchased. It&#x27;s feminine and sexy so there&#x27;s no regrets here.</li>
    <li> I was so looking forward to receiving this and so disappointed when I did.  It had little aroma and what was there smelled more like cooking oil.  I did read a number of the comments.  I&#x27;m wondering if it was fake.</li>
    <li> smells great , very soft scent love it</li>
    <li> I wear the oil version of egyptian godess. I receive so many compliments especially from men.  Men of all demographics seem to be drawn to it&#x27;s scent. It&#x27;s has a very broad appeal as well as a  unique smell that is warm and seductive and also subtle. The scent mixes with your body heat and it&#x27;s like magic. It&#x27;s not a floral smell. The smell reminds me of inscense. Love, Love, Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have the roll on version of this oil and I LOVE it.. I went ahead and ordered this in the larger bottle - and just as other reviews warned about, it is so diluted that it has barely any scent whatsoever.  I am bummed out!! I HATE that you can&#x27;t count on a consistent product.  This just smells like oil - not worth it at all! I will stick with the roll on from here on out..</li>
    <li> This wonderful smelling oil comes in a bottle so large that it will probably last me for several years. The fragrance is not overpowering but soflty sweet, warm and very feminine. A great value for the money.</li>
    <li> Love this scent!  I&#x27;ll continue to re-order when I run out; product shipped quickly!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance. It is like no other. Pairs nicely with the soap of the same fragrance. A very sexy all woman smell that exudes confidence.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product!  Love the smell!</li>
    <li> Not nearly potent enough.  I was expecting this musk to be so much better than it was. .. no lasting scent.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume!!! Best ever &amp; tons of compliments!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, and this time, it was super thin and the scent was very diluted.</li>
    <li> I have purchased roll on before and found this tone great as well. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> this wonderful product arrived in good time and great shape. best of all- it smells great. i used wild musk coty oil for years, and as you all know it is unavailable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Egyptian Goddess oil and incense for years. Auric Blends have maintained their quality and I hope they continue to do so. A nice subtle musk that is clean-smelling and not overbearing.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume oil.  It&#x27;s slightly musky but not too strong.  I haven&#x27;t smelled anything quite like it before so I feel like I have my own unique scent.  I also have a smaller roll on one so I use this to refill it.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this scent. It is a very light, feminine musk. It is a very sensual scent, I have already received numerous compliments from the gentlemen!</li>
    <li> When my daughter purchased this scent years ago, it smelled great....now there is hardly a scent at all...don&#x27;t waste ur money..can&#x27;t smell a thing!</li>
    <li> My daughter in laws favorite!!  It was nice to see a larger bottle instead of the little slim roll on containers and the price was good also!!</li>
    <li> This has been my FAVORITE perfume for years, I&#x27;ve gotten thousands of compliments on it over the years.&lt;br /&gt;The last time I ordered it, it wasn&#x27;t quite the same, something was different. I noticed it was more diluted but&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t think much about it at first, then when I wore it, I noticed it didn&#x27;t smell as strong as it always did, I thought&lt;br /&gt;it was just me at first, then I talked to some other friends who use it too (thanks to my referral) and they noticed&lt;br /&gt;the same thing, I don&#x27;t know why they would mess with perfection, but I&#x27;m looking for a new perfume until they change&lt;br /&gt;it back to the old version!!!!!  Charge more if you must, just make it the original way! PLEASE</li>
    <li> I have used it only for 5 days and already the scent is faded to nothing, so sad. I read the reviews and hoped the few who had this problem were an unusual complaint. I hate to send things back, but this turned out to be a bummer.</li>
    <li> scent not as strong as it use to be years ago.. very disappointed you can barely smell&lt;br /&gt;they need to go back to the way it use to be.</li>
    <li> This perfume has the most softest, alluring fragrance to it that I have ever smelled or purchased before. Yes the bottle size is also a very good size that will surely last for a very long time. If you&#x27;re into clean, soft fragrances then you will love this.</li>
    <li> This product is NOT worth the money lost  the scent way to fast not even half of the bottle used. I just bought another from but was the spray version i figurd it might be better and last longer...boy was I WRONG have had it 2weeks and scent does not exist..WILL NEVER BUY THIS BRAND AGAIN $50.00 WASTED burned twice..</li>
    <li> This was a wonderful buy. A timeless scent for everyday wear!</li>
    <li> Has a very clean scent.  It is not overpowering and I can catch a whiff of it--soft but it is there.  Love it.  Came right on time.</li>
    <li> I love this oil . I tried other brands but this is the best!! I would absolutely recommend this to everyone...in fact I have!!!</li>
    <li> I like this fragrance but to me it doesn&#x27;t smell the same. It seems like it&#x27;s to oiled down to where the fragrance doesn&#x27;t stand out like it use too.</li>
    <li> I love g his Egyptian goddess oil and perfume this is the only place I found it and love it. Never had a problem</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume oil! I&#x27;ve bought other brands of Egyptian Musk because I love the scent, but none of them come close to this one. I love the fact that the oil is a bit thicker, so it seems to have staying power. I love that I can at any point get a small whiff of it and it has such a calming effect on me. This is good stuff and I&#x27;ll continue to buy this brand instead of the others. I also love that I get so many compliments from wearing it. Funny thing is that it&#x27;s usually at the gym after I&#x27;ve been sweating that I get these compliments. So it&#x27;s nice to think that it actually continues to work even when I&#x27;ve been sweating. Love it!</li>
    <li> What can I say?  I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Heavenly! I wear this daily. Yes, it&#x27;s true that you can&#x27;t smell it on your own self for very long, but I promise that other&#x27;s can smell it on you ALL day. It&#x27;s very subtle- not the type of scent that overwhelms the senses. People stop me in the strangest places and ask what I&#x27;m wearing (grocery store, parking lots, the park, everywhere I go &amp; I love the compliments). I work in a healthcare facility and many of my patients and co-workers have asked me to order it for them.  Men say it&#x27;s intoxicating &amp; women want it for themselves. I&#x27;ve been wearing this for almost a decade so I&#x27;ve learned a lot about the mystery of Egyptian Goddess. I&#x27;m not sure how to explain it, but a small portion of the population simply can not smell it. I&#x27;d almost describe it as &#x27;scent blindness&#x27; (I made that up) but some people&#x27;s noses simply can&#x27;t smell it. My Mom being one of them and unfortunately my boyfriend can&#x27;t either. So, for those of you who say you tried it &amp; couldn&#x27;t smell it, give this a try. Wear it for a few days, I rub it on the tops of my hands, wrists &amp; then rub my wrist on my shirt. I bet someone will stop you &amp; say you smell fabulous. If anyone does give this a try, I&#x27;d love to hear about your results. Egyptian Goddess is worth every penny. I look forward to hearing your experiences.</li>
    <li> This oil compliments ANY fragrance I wear. This scent stays on my skin all day. I saw that some said they did not have the same experience and was concerned due to their posts but I have used this oil nearly everyday since I got it and it lasts. My kids and hubby all love it.</li>
    <li> Such a beautifully smelling perfume.  I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.  You only need a very little bit on your finger before applying to your neck and wrists.  The bottle will last an extremely long time.</li>
    <li> Changed my mind. Never had so many compliments.  I cannot smell it post application,  but others praise it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this scent and oil</li>
    <li> I love this perfume oil but I assume this product is very old. there is no scent left to this oil.</li>
    <li> I love this product because the smell is subtle, yet sexy. It&#x27;s an oil so the smell lasts longer. Just be sure not to get a drop on your clothes because I imagine it would be difficut to remove. I wish it came with an applicator (maybe a roller ball or glass rod). I use my finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product came intact and quick.</li>
    <li> Compliments every single day! I hope they never stop making it.</li>
    <li> When I opened the bottle and smelt it as well as put a dab on my wrist, I was really impressed with the fragrance.  I was so impressed until I put it on again the following morning.  I can only guess that the bottle had been filled with oil and only one droplet of perfume was put into it, which just sat on top of the oil, just a faint scent is detectable.</li>
    <li> have order directly  form auric blends in the past. This product did not smell quite the same. not quite sure why</li>
    <li> amazon fair prices and good products</li>
    <li> My husband &amp; I love this scent! Soft &amp; clean yet sexy. We&#x27;re always complimented on when wearing it. I like how it somehow seems like the scent fades &amp; I can&#x27;t smell it on myself, but everyone else can. Never nauseating, perfect for any occasion. May be a little feminine for some guys, but I promise, it smells wonderful on mine. If you&#x27;re into perfume oil you won&#x27;t regret getting this.</li>
    <li> This is my go to scent.  Men Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this and at first I couldn&#x27;t smell a thing and thought I was anosmic to musk as there were a few others that I could not smell at all. This was thick in consistency and went on me like cooking oil. Then I remembered reading somewhere that if you put in on a windowsill, it would help to develop the scent. What I did was gently turned the bottle upside down and rolled it around, then I took the cap off and put it in the microwave oven for 15 seconds, took it out put the cap back on and rolled it again, took the cap off and put it back in the microwave for another 15 seconds. I did this 4 times, your microwave may vary. The oil was a little thinner and the smell was there. I did this just enough to get the bottle warm. It didn&#x27;t get extremely strong, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to. It smelled beautiful to me and on me. Now I am thinking I should have hung onto those other oils and tried this out. I was so glad to find out this worked for me and I hope its helpful to someone else. I don&#x27;t take pleasure in spending money on things and then having buyers remorse. And if I find I have to use this method each time I wear it, its only a matter of less than 5 minutes to go through the process. Yay! I can smell musk!!!</li>
    <li> It smells good but to me it doesn&#x27;t last that long. I think I will stick to my Jovan White Musk.</li>
    <li> Love it and received it on time would highly suggest getting this product</li>
    <li> this is my all time favorite scent of all time ever...seriously, fresh clean and subtle enough with a lingering scent</li>
    <li> With my allergies this is the only thing I can wear that does not affect me. Everyone always comments when I am around about who smells so good!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I get wonderful compliments when I wear it. The fragrance is light, refreshing and awesome. Love this product ! It is a keeper and my top oil fragrance. I&#x27;ve used this product for approximately 2 years.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 8 years and I absolutely love this fragrance. I get compliments on it all the time because it is such a subtle, yet powerful scent. I started out buying the little roll-on bottles and after about 6 of those, I decided to switch to the larger bottle in 2012. Now, in 2014 I was almost out so I needed to re-up my stock! My mom had purchased the same bottle last year from a different seller and it was exactly as the other reviews had described. Diluted, scent didn&#x27;t last, smelled like cooking oil, etc. and Upon reading these reviews, I feared the same. I was going to be so broken-hearted if my favorite scent in the entire world had changed. The product I received did smell a little different when first put on, a little more tobacco-y scented, but ended up lasting the entire day. I do agree that something in the product changed, for I still have a little bit in my old bottle on reserve but for the most part, the integrity of the product is intact. DEFINITELY BUY FROM AURIC BLENDS JUST TO BE SURE.</li>
    <li> I read so many reviews about the Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess being so wonderful, that I had to try it. First off, not only does this stuff not have a &amp;#34;wonderful delicate fragrance&amp;#34;, as so many reviewers claimed, it has very little if any fragrance at all. What little it does have, has a slight &amp;#34;rubber&amp;#34; odor. No, I&#x27;m not kidding, it smelled like rubber! I even did a little test and had my husband smell it on me, and he actually wrinkled his nose and asked what the heck it was I had on. So it wasn&#x27;t just me dear reader. Even my dog had a funny reaction to the scent. What ever it is that people are going on about, it sure isn&#x27;t this. I am throwing the bottle away, and chalking all of this up to live and learn. Oh, and I will know better in the future to stray away from quality perfumes, that may cost a little more, but are sooo worth the extra cost. I will most definitely not be recommending this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery. Nice quantity for the price. Very nice scent. So weak. I like a nice strong lasting scent. Like it, just a little disappointed with it&#x27;s lasting potency.</li>
    <li> Excellent and prontly service</li>
    <li> Let me star by saying that I have been using this scented oil for over 25 years, it&#x27;s one my all time favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchase this product back in 2012 directly from Auric Blends. The scent was strong, just a little bit of the oil went along way. Fast Forward to Feb 2014, I was running low so I decided to purchase another bottle, the same exact product, but this time from another seller (Day Dream) This time around the scent is almost non-existent....WTH?!?! I still have some left from my 2012 purchase and there&#x27;s a NOTICEABLE difference in the strength of the fragrance. I&#x27;m assuming that somehow this batch has been diluted or it&#x27;s a different formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately these bottles do NOT come with a sealed cap so who knows what can happen to it from the time the manufacturer bottles this product to the time you get it delivered. Or it could be a Quality Control issue, either way this was a complete waste of money. I will be requesting a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whole foods here locally sells the 1/3 Oz Roll-on Bottle which seemed to be very consistent with the one I purchased here on Amazon in 2012, I guess I will stick to that rom now on.</li>
    <li> This is my smell. I love it. I always get good feed back from others, everyone keeps asking me what I am wearing. I keep this one a secret, I just say, I use soap and water.</li>
    <li> I love how this smells! I get compliments on it all the time and you only need to use a small dab. I will be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> GREAT SMELL AND IT BLENDS IN VERY WELL WITH THE SKIN....A message to everyone....this last a really REALLY long time,so do BE AWARE OF THE AMOUNT YOU PUT ON YOURSELF AND KEEP TRYING until you get your perfect amount for you.</li>
    <li> This is a soft, subtle musk. It&#x27;s clean and gives a &#x27;your skin but better vibe&#x27;. I think it&#x27;s wondeful for the price and will continue to buy it. :)</li>
    <li> Weak scent. Smells like mineral oil</li>
    <li> I love the scent of the Egyptian Goddess Perfume Oil.  I now have my two Daughters using it too!! I am always getting compliments that I SMELL GOOD.</li>
    <li> Want to smell divine?  Want people to say to you, &amp;#34;Oooh, you smell so good!&amp;#34;?  Here&#x27;s the perfume oil for you.  I just love this!  Been wearing it for 15 years.  I don&#x27;t like Department Store perfumes, they smell like chemicals to me.  I want a clean, fresh, earthly smell on me.  So, if this is what you&#x27;re looking for too, this is the one for you!  Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I have to agree with some of the negative reviews.  My bottle did not have much fragrance, and I am a bit disappointed.  I saw this item in a natural foods store, and it was rather expensive. I tried some on in the store, and the aroma lasted all day. I loved it! So I came to Amazon and found it here for a much cheaper price.  I have to put a LOT of oil on in order to smell it, and the scent disappears within a few hours.  I can&#x27;t imagine why this bottle would be different from the one I tried on in the store, but it seems to be.  I really love the fragrance, but this bottle did not really deliver.</li>
    <li> The roll on was much better. I will NEVER buy this size again!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell. so soft and clean .... It&#x27;s exactly the smell I like. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> No absolute perfume in it!!!</li>
    <li> Oh my GOODNESS!!!! I LLLLLLOVE this size! I adore this fragrance and I knew I would need a bigger one. I received it today and I am thrilled! I&#x27;m looking forward to placing a regular order each time I run low and I&#x27;ll be ordering many other items as well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you and I&#x27;ll talk to you soon!!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly as we have always loved! The scent is unique, clean, for male or female. The compliments on it when we go places is always positive, unlike some other oils. Very sensual; yet a hint of strength.</li>
    <li> I must say that I am very impressed with this perfume. I have been looking for this exact perfume for a long time. I was able to buy it on here, and I was really excited about it. It really has met my expectations.</li>
    <li> just got my Egyptian goddess perfume and I love it  thank you sending it so quickly,</li>
    <li> Smells great, roll on is easier.</li>
    <li> Smells very good, although it does not last very long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started using oils as perfumes at least for 3 months now. It wasn&#x27;t until I started using this one thy my husband mentioned how much HE LOVED IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I feel like I need to layer it on because I can&#x27;t smell it... But you can smell it. And it does lady all day!!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this fragrance, but when I received mine both fom this site and a Roll on that I purchased elsewhere, the scent is not noticeable.  It has now been a few months....will it get stronger with aging, or have there been batches with defects.</li>
    <li> My wife is absolutely addicted to this scent! She rubs it all over several times a day and can&#x27;t stop sniffing herself! LoL&lt;br /&gt;Her only complaint is that the scent does not last very long like normal perfumes and that&#x27;s why I only gave it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume, but it is very, very subtle.  If you like heavy perfumes, this is not for you.  I bought the oil and it&#x27;s especially nice after a shower.</li>
    <li> This is the only scent I use and have been wearing it for years. I went to this site to buy it because it was cheaper, but I feel like it was diluted... Definitely not as potent as usual... I will be buying from the auric blends from now on</li>
    <li> I had previously used the Egyptian Goddess roll on which was great. I loved the scent so much I decided to get the larger bottle which was a bit different than the roll on I had used. It barely had any scent to it. I thought maybe I had just gotten used to it because when I first opened the bottle I could tell it was Egyptian Goddess. I didn&#x27;t use it for a day or so &amp; when I did I turned the bottle upside down and sideways to mix it up before putting it on. I used a fair amount and thought the scent was a bit stronger. Some family members commented on well I smelled and I confirmed it was the Egyptian Goddess. I had read reviews about others ending up with no scent. Perhaps, the bottled oil is a bit less potent than the roll on. Try turning the bottle before each use. Seemed to work with mine. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s supposed to be very strong, anyway. Its a wonderful scent. Very light and relaxing...&amp; it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache!!!</li>
    <li> Smells awful, very disgusting, the scent is still lingering in my nose, makes me want to vomit.</li>
    <li> Hardly ANY smell at All and when you do get a whiff it smells like a campfire .</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  It&#x27;s a bit of sweetness and a bit of musk.  I dislike just about every perfume I&#x27;ve smelled over the years and had nearly given up on finding anything other than just essential oils.  Most perfumes are overly floral or acrid and biting and they give me a headache.  This scent doesn&#x27;t induce headaches for me.  The reason I give it 4 stars is because the bottle&#x27;s narrow base makes it easy to tip over ... and if this happened without the lid it would be so very messy!</li>
    <li> great price , was a perfect present for a friend and they loved it</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume, has been ever since high school in the 90&#x27;s, and I love having such a large bottle of it. I add it to my bath water, to unscented lotion, even on a cotton ball in my pillowcase. It&#x27;s such a soft, lovely fragrance, after all these years, I still can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
    <li> Love love love it if you want Egyptian musk oil this is the brand you want Shake well before applying</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess for years, and when i saw they had a perfume spray i was seriously excited! What could be better than spraying this wonderful scent all over my body? Well, at the first spritz my excitement had turned to sadness and disappointment, it had the distinct scent of buy spray! I looked at the ingredients and knew that it was the strange alcohol that had something to do with it. I just don&#x27;t understand why they would ruin such a wonderful product with something so yucky. Once the gross bug spray scent wore off, a very weak EG scent was noticeable, however, it just wasn&#x27;t the same. I&#x27;m sticking to the roll on oil and the perfume solid from now on and would never recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very big bottle it it smells so soft and wonderful not too strong.  I like to use it when i go to bed!!!!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this body oil. It&#x27;s aroma is very nice. I always get compliments when I wear it. Very soft scented, never over powering and natural.</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful. I could bathe in this stuff!!</li>
    <li> this oil was veryyyyy yummy smelling, especially right when i opened the box.  it still retains a strong smell when i wear it, but tends to wear off pretty easily after sayyy 5 hours or something.  but i wear it whenever i can cuz i like the musky smell.  will stick to buying smaller bottles after i use this up, but it is still nice :)  thanks</li>
    <li> hi, this solution seems different since I used it the first day.  The smell is  gone. What&#x27;s the deal? I feel I got ripped off. I don&#x27;t want to post this.  Help...my perfume lost it  sent......I did not lose my nose. thanks</li>
    <li> OH WOW.  MY FAVORITE FRAGRANCE.  NICE AND CLEAN.  GET ALOT OF COMPLIMENTS.  HAVE AN OVERSTOCK OF&lt;br /&gt;IT RIGHT NOW.  BETTER TOO MUCH THAN NOT ENOUGH.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll have to agree with other reviewers on this in that you can barely smell the fragrance. On occasion I get a very faint smell, which is fantabulous. Wish Auric would go back to their original formula.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this!!&lt;br /&gt;I use to wear it all through high school, and feel in love it was my first perfume that lasted throughout the day, and smelled way better than those crappy body mists.&lt;br /&gt;This is an Egyptian musk, and if you&#x27;ve never been a fan of that smell then you won&#x27;t like it. I wear this during the winter time because it&#x27;s very subtle, sophisticated, and I always get people asking &amp;#34;that smells good what is that?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s is about 1.7 oz but it will definitely last you a long time especially if you don&#x27;t wear it that often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an oil so it will be a lot thicker than a liquid perfume. Put your index finger over the open and tip the bottle upside down. With the oil on your finger apply it behind your ear/under jawline, inside wrist, and inside elbow (this will make any perfume last longer).</li>
    <li> Love this scent! Have been buying it for about 4 years now. Always a good price and shipping is fast.</li>
    <li> I was Very,Very,Very DISAPPOINTED with this Product. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!! BUYER BEWARE!! the Product has no smell whatsoever. NO SMELL OR FRAGRANCE. JUST PLAIN OIL!! Just got this today and I just tossed it in the Garbage!! I won&#x27;t be buying from this seller and this Product anymore! Total Rip-Off! Wasted my $19.95. :-(((</li>
    <li> I love this product. Have been using it for months. And it never disappoints</li>
    <li> This is such a great value!  It smells great, and the bottle looks great.  I will definitely order this again</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like \\&quot;fashionable\\&quot; scents. i like scents that highlight my body chemistry and this does just that. Men and women love it. it&#x27;s sexy. it&#x27;s fresh. and lasts a long time. i use the roll on and the oil. be sure to get this scent from auric blends because everyone does not blend it the same.</li>
    <li> Again, the scent is quite faint.  What I could make out was fairly nice but you have to have your nose almost directly on perfumed area.  Would I re-order?  No</li>
    <li> I purchased the small roll on of this Egyptian Goddess in a shop and fell in love with the scent although it seemed to fade quickly.  I was hoping this would be a different experience.  Not so.  This oil has even less scent and was a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN IN LOVE WITH EGYPTIAN GODDESS FOR YEARS. I&#x27;VE ALWAYS USED THE SMALL ROLL ON. NOW THAT I FOUND THIS I AM HAPPY BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT MORE. THANKS</li>
    <li> It just smells lovely. People stop me everywhere I go &amp;#34;you smell so good...what are you wearing&amp;#34;? When I say Egyptian Goddess they always want to know where to get it. It&#x27;s a very subtle scent not overwhelming like many perfumes and smells calm and fresh I love it.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it !!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfume oils,  I orginally purchased some at a health food store and fell in love w/ the frangrance and sillage.  I wear it Everyday and always get complements on it.  This perfume in diluted it does not smell like Egyptian Godness at all, in my opinion and it&#x27;s was the same price as the orginal, because I would call what I purchased that.  All it smells like is a heavy based oil....GO TO THE WEBSITE if you want the perfume.</li>
    <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last , would love to return it .</li>
    <li> If i could  do no star&#x27;s  i would. It&#x27;s  nothing but oil, Zero scent what so ever! I couldn&#x27;t  believe  it.  I was so excited  to  get it but come to find out its  not what  they  say. Extremely  disappointed</li>
    <li> Awful! Has NO scent at all...Bring back Egyptian Goddess!</li>
    <li> For me, this scent was not good at all! Heavy on the rose scent and not a nice mellow scent at all! Even after a couple of hours the scent did not fade down at all and was just so overpowering and awful that I had to scrub it off.</li>
    <li> Love my Egyptian Goddess.</li>
    <li> it has no smell to it whatsoever...smells like oil...with no fragrance</li>
    <li> Such a unique scent- very soft and feminine. I&#x27;ll never use anything else! It lasts all day and I always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume, even after over 15 years of wearing Egyptian Goddess I still get complimented regularly on the scent.</li>
    <li> This has a soft, not overpowering musk smell.  I like to put it on after showering and have even found that I can use it in place of deodorant.  The smell does go away, or at least the one wearing it can&#x27;t smell it after awhile.  My daughter kept telling me it was too strong, but I couldn&#x27;t even smell it, so I don&#x27;t know what to say about that.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the bottle.  I had to put a small flat dish under it because it leaks. I would still recommend it.</li>
    <li> i bought this 1.7 oz Perfume in hopes that it would be stronger than the oil.. i was a bit disappointed at the very mild almost non-existent scent.  The quick service from vendor was excellent but the product is weak.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not smelling it.  The fragrance is too weak for me.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me, My husband isn&#x27;t impressed either.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume, ever.  It smells so good...everyone I hug tells me I smell &amp;#34;delicious&amp;#34;.  Funny though, once you put it on, you can&#x27;t smell it yourself, so you think it&#x27;s worn off.  But everyone else is enjoying it when they come close to you.  I would recommend this perfume to anyone young or old.  It&#x27;s soft and wonderful.  Can be worn night or day.</li>
    <li> The scent isn&#x27;t very strong and I have used this before so I know it should have a stronger scent.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this perfume, but it doesn&#x27;t love me.  I wondered why I had headaches a lot and did some trial and error and found out it was this perfume.  It totally bummed me out because I love this smell.  My friend wears it at work and I&#x27;ve realized that smell gives me a headache, too.  I normally do not get bothered by perfume, so I&#x27;m not sure what it is.  This did not go to waste, though, my 17-year old loved it, so I gave it to her.  I just told her to put it on when she leaves the house!</li>
    <li> Great product! It smells great, exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I have bought this same brand before and loved it, this bottle has hardly any fragrance at all. wish I liked this one as well as the last</li>
    <li> i was excited about this purchase, as i was just about out of the roll on, however the fragrance is VERY light, you can barely smell it.&lt;br /&gt;for the price, i would have expected a little bit more.</li>
    <li> This is a bottle of oil. There is absolutely *NO* perfume in it, nor does it contain anything to cause it to have a scent. I cannot believe I bought this after reading reviews stating exactly that. But I thought with my hound-dog sense of smell I&#x27;ll be able to enjoy this &#x27;fine perfume.&#x27; No such thing. There is *NO* smell here AT ALL. This one is going back. Do NOT buy.</li>
    <li> This beautiful scent has become one of my favorites. I purchased a small container months ago and decided to go for the full size and I am enjoying it tremendously and I get compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> LOVE this perfume, just wish it came in a spray</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff on earth. I am very picky about smells and this is my all time favorite. I get complimented all the time and have shared the link to page with several people so they can order it. It smells clean and fresh but unique. I buy a bottle every few months.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the real Egyptian musk oil, I was hoping because my oil that I&#x27;ve been using is very hard to get. The woman that makes it is ill and I was hoping your product would have been it. It starts with the smell then it just looses it&#x27;s sent. It&#x27;s not very good.</li>
    <li> Love this oil just make sure not to loose the paper cover or it leaks out. Will buy another bottle soon</li>
    <li> Absolutely no smell to this oil, why called it a perfume oil? Just a bottle of thick,gluey oil. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the scent is so faint that you can&#x27;t even smell it when it is on your skin.</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  I always get compliments.  Like some reviewers mentioned, I thought the scent had faded, but people smell it on me even when I can&#x27;t smell it myself.  The price is reasonable too.</li>
    <li> love love love the scent</li>
    <li> Egyptian Goddess is just the best fragrance on the market! Nothing else (in my mind) even comes close!!  I have loved this oil for years, I will ALWAYS be buying this. I am currently waiting for my fourth bottle to arrive , via mail.. A beautiful soft airy musk powdery notes and slight floral notes. You cant go wrong with this scent..</li>
    <li> I always love perfumes,since a very young age.i was looking trough amazon and ask to see old fraganze.i saw this perfume and then I read the peoples review and then took a chance,i made my order.i love the cent so much that every time I go to the bathroom I put some on,funny but true iam a perfume maniac.this cent is so soft I just want to drink it.thats how much I like it...&lt;br /&gt;Egyptian godess</li>
    <li> Best ever, really lasts no need to use any other fragrance. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this selection. Lots of compliments with this one.</li>
    <li> Returned this stuff immediately...they must have changed the blend from previous as some reviews were truly delighted with the oil.  This was basically vegetable oil or something of less quality... I was VERY DISAPPOINTED. Thankfully they gave a refund on my return.</li>
    <li> I read a review from another buyer saying the scent isn&#x27;t what it used to be. That is seems to be &amp;#34;watered&amp;#34; down or they changed the formula and sadly I agree. This was by far my favorite scent product and I would give all the stars allowable before; So I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I purchased through Amazon (seems odd though - that a different product formula would be sent out through amazon orders) or what may be going on. I might purchase one more bottle to see if that&#x27;s indeed the case but have no expectations.</li>
    <li> This  scent is  nothing like Patchouly... I was very very disappointed. I am returning this product.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has order a Authentic patchouly perfume oil please let me know.</li>
    <li> UPDATE!  As with other reviewers, this product is nowhere nearly as &amp;#34;potent&amp;#34; as bottles I&#x27;ve purchased in the past from Amazon.  The fragrance dissipates quickly and it seems I have to use more.  Frankly, I can barely smell it!  What&#x27;s up with that, Auric Blends? Or is Amazon keeping it on the shelf too long?  Whatever the case, I share other customers&#x27; disappointment and I&#x27;m changing my original 5-star rating to 3-stars.  Sad times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I will never try another brand of Egyptian Musk oil again.  I&#x27;ve strayed to other brands because of price and/or reviews, but no more.  Nothing smells as good as this brand, and no other Egyptian Musk gets the compliments this one does.  Everywhere I go, people comment on how fresh and clean I smell.  When I tell them it&#x27;s Egyptian Musk, they are surprised.  &amp;#34;But you don&#x27;t smell like musk oil!&amp;#34; they&#x27;ll respond, and they&#x27;re correct.  I don&#x27;t know how to describe it other than, well, fresh and clean as I mentioned above.  Don&#x27;t bother trying imitations or you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it&#x27;s still the BEST fragrance EVER!! I get so many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I love this purfume so much that i will probably still try other purfumes,but this one is my main one the smell is just sexy and not loud. I love this purfume so much that when someone gives me a compliment. I don&#x27;t want to tell them the name because i don&#x27;t want them walking around with my perfume. I love it ,I love it,I love it. THANK GOD FOR THIS PERFUME.</li>
    <li> ADVISE TO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS SELLER!!! TWICE I ordered the Egyptian Goddess perfume from this seller (second time by mistake, I didn&#x27;t realize I was ordering from the same people). Twice I received some kind of diluted oil - almost no smell detected at all! It was nothing like this old favorite scent I have been wearing most of my life! Very Disappointing! I think I will be buying this product directly through Auric Blends from now on.</li>
    <li> This is indeed the oil, not the diluted perfume. This has been my wife&#x27;s scent since... forever, and at the time I write this Amazon has the best deal on the internet.</li>
    <li> What can I say? Smells fabulous. .great gift for a friend..I burned mine in the oiler..next two I get I&#x27;ll burn one and wear one..my home smelled so good..my friend liked hers alot also...</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this scent. I had purchased it a small amount in solid form at a local shop and really enjoyed it. I decided to take the leap and get the oil. I am not disappointed. This is the first time I have used perfume oil, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to use it correctly.</li>
    <li> Heavenly scent. It smells like a cheap perfume that you just can&#x27;t put down. I can&#x27;t explain it any other way.  It&#x27;s wonderful and odd smelling at the same time.  Supposedly it&#x27;s the secret ingredient in Gee Your Hair Smells Terrific....and I believe it.    Update 9/2014 Scent is completely gone. Now it is just a rancid oil.</li>
    <li> beautiful scent though I noticed that sometimes you buy it it&#x27;s stronger and longer lasting than other times. I think it depends how the batch is  mixed. maybe sometimes it isn&#x27;t mixed well enough and there could be more concentration in some bottles and less in others...Nice when you get the random bottle with the heavy concentration but sucks when you get the dud cause the scent is too gentle and doesn&#x27;t last..</li>
    <li> This is my go to scent. I wear it both alone and with other perfumes. I use this bottle to refill a roller ball that I have. It doesn&#x27;t take much and most people just know I &amp;#34;smell good&amp;#34; but they can&#x27;t quite put their finger on it. I apply it in this fashion with the roller ball; a nickel sized circle on one wrist, rub both wrists together, and a dot, just touching the roller ball to the skin, behind each ear. The scent lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have purchased the fine perfume oil. I&#x27;ve been buying the roll-on for years. I can&#x27;t tell what justifies the much higher cost. The fragrance is disappointingly subtle and I have an oddly keen sense of smell. Based on the numerous other complaints about weak fragrance I will likely not buy this product again unless I can smell it first. Bums me out. Now I&#x27;m going to go burn things to deal with my pain.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product many time in the past and was completely satisfied. Not so much with this order! It barely has any smell at all? Just a very faint smell. Not sure what happened but will not order this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the positive reviews it got. However, the negative reviews overpowered the positive ones when i finally recieved my order! First, let me start off by saying that this prduct did NOT come in its&#x27; own box within the package. It was individually wrapped in cellophane and tape!! Honestly, what the heck? When i opened it to try it out the product was FRAGRANCE-FREE upon application and stayed that way. I left it on for a few minutes to see it it would absorb and it didn&#x27;t ; it just left a awfully greasy oil slick on my write. The heart breaking part is that this product had a faint potential of smelling beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this product. I don&#x27;t want you guys to go through the heartbreak i went through. 😥</li>
    <li> my wife loves this scent</li>
    <li> LOVE this...my signature scent.</li>
    <li> I love this! It has an amazing fragrance that last all day and I receive compliments from strangers all of the time! This is a quality perfume oil.</li>
    <li> I got this product after smelling it on a friend. It smelled very nice. Excited to receive my purchase, I opened the bottle and it smelled nice, but as I used it the smell went away. I don&#x27;t even smell it out of the bottle now. I don&#x27;t know if this has something to do with my chemistry or not, but after the first whiff after I opened the bottle, it doesn&#x27;t even smell to me now.</li>
    <li> Such a wonderful scent. Many compliments and inquires.</li>
    <li> The scent was exactly what I was looking for, however it does not last long.</li>
    <li> No scent at all, I returned it.</li>
    <li> Hardly any scent at all! The oil is very sticky.  Rip off!</li>
    <li> Seemed watered down compared to the roll on, and the smell only lasted a couple minutes, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of what my favorite musks use to smell like -- light and long-lasting.  Would highly recommend for anyone.</li>
    <li> This smell of this perfume is amazing, however I am very disappointed with the oil perfume. No matter how much I put on, the smell fades withinnthe hour!! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance in the roll-on I bought a couple of years ago.  The scent is very mild, but pleasant while it lasts.  But this 1.7 oz. bottle of it is useless unless you are looking for an oil, nothing more.  It has nearly no detectable scent.  Immediately after dabbing it on (because this bottle has no roller and no sprayer), I can barely smell it even when putting my nose right on my wrist.  Olive oil has more fragrance.  I consider this purchase a waste of money.  I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
