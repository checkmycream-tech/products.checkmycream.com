      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I was satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>I think anything you can do to promote good healing is worth it.</li>
      <li>I also was able to cut a section off to use if I didn&#x27;t want to wrap it all the way</li>
      <li>A lot of people have wondered if this is an authentic gelzone belt.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, in my particular experience, this belt works great.</li>
      <li>I really loved my first gelone belt.  </li>
      <li>and they are more comfortable.  </li>
      <li>Washes well and easy to use.</li>
      <li>started wearing this at 2 1/2 week post.wear on skin then a huge silk grandma underwear then a compresstion</li>
      <li>I found this Gelzone Belt to be extremely comfortable and wore it 16 hours a day.</li>
      <li>Its fairly comfortable and can be adjusted to to fit your level of compression.</li>
      <li>Anything that can help you recover faster and better is worth trying.</li>
      <li>Also, it is comfortable with support needed when in the healing process.</li>
      <li>It is a good binder but is pretty hot and makes me itch along my scar area.  </li>
      <li>I definitly can not wear it without wearing a compression garment on top because the belt will simply not stay on and adhere on its own...</li>
      <li>The delivery was quick and in a secure package.</li>
      <li>And with this type of scar, to me, that&#x27;s a huge plus and worth trying this belt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used this shortly after a tummy tuck and loved it.</li>
      <li>and you need to wear silicone for 2-3 months to achieve the full benefit.</li>
      <li>While I do understand that what Amazon is actually shipping is not the official \\&quot;Gelzone\\&quot;, this silicone belt is still a really good value.</li>
      <li>I may wear it now only if I&#x27;m wearing something a bit more form fitting.</li>
      <li>Right now I&#x27;m still wearing a binder and bra all the time, but I take them off at night.  </li>
      <li>Very pleased with the healing of the scar due to using this belt.</li>
      <li>I was so pleased that I promptly ordered a second one.  </li>
      <li>I used dial antibacterial and it was still sticky (good thing) when it dried.</li>
      <li>I was able to cut the belt to make two long pieces.</li>
      <li>It riped really fast.</li>
      <li>I used this Gelzone garment belt after having my c-section and it really did work.</li>
      <li>And made me very sweaty</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t think it was a real</li>
      <li>I wear it for 12 hours each day and wash it with gentle soap each night.</li>
      <li>I guess I cant complain too much.</li>
      <li>helps you to move and feel better.help flat puck skin and smooth scar.</li>
      <li>Bear in mind that you still need to be careful when you clean it, but if you do it right it works.</li>
      <li>Genuine gel zone product as described, but couldn&#x27;t use for long..</li>
      <li>The silicone has a stickiness to it, so I just gently wrap it around my body, I do pull it a little bit when attaching the velcro, but for the most part, I&#x27;m not stretching it much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is falling apart, in the same way that my first one did after 4 weeks!  </li>
      <li>However, if you are wearing it for a little while, it is ok.</li>
      <li>She has been using it for the past 4 weeks (only at bedtime) and I do see some good scar healing;</li>
      <li>I started usinging it again right after and broke out 3 days later.</li>
      <li>The product was new out of the box.</li>
      <li>Usually the scar is not as big as the area of the whole sheet that covers your body, but you have to cover a large area of your body in order for the velcros to secure the sheet.</li>
      <li>Now there are several large tears in the sheeting after one month use.</li>
      <li>As far as I know, it is.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know how much the silicone actually helped, but I know it didn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 7 weeks thus far.</li>
      <li>After consulting with my doctor, he told me to use the small silicone strips just enough to cover the scar itself, which has been working better for me.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend to future abdominal surgery patients.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, the belt is wide enough that the actual scar is still covered by the silicone sheeting.</li>
      <li>The scar is beginning to fade - lighten in color - it&#x27;s definitely not as red, but some of that could just be attributed to natural healing over time.</li>
      <li>Sheeting can be very expensive over a long period of time to replace, so this sheeting filled the bill as l was able to cut into strips and use as needed.  </li>
      <li>Dont be a victim of the classic \\&quot;bait &amp; switch\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I had to wind up ordering the real thing from another site other than amazon.</li>
      <li>This product was soooo much cheaper than any other silicone gel strip product.  </li>

<li> I had to wind up ordering the real thing from another site other than amazon.</li>
<li> This product was soooo much cheaper than any other silicone gel strip product.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because I did not use it long enough to test out the quality or effectiveness of the silicone.</li>
<li> There will be a large area of your skin not able to breath any air for a long time.</li>
<li> They also last really long especially if you take the time to wash and dry them carefully.  </li>
<li> it just doesnt conform to my shape very well because it has a stiff fabric backing on the other side.</li>
<li> I used after my lower body lift it smoothed the scar , however I didn&#x27;t use it for a long time because I had another surgery , that&#x27;s why the scar didn&#x27;t fade away .</li>
<li> Been wearing it daily for about 4 months now, and it&#x27;s just beginning to show a little wear on the ends that I overlap, which doesn&#x27;t actually touch my skin, so no worries there.</li>
<li> Your skin should be completely dry when you put on the belt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> When you consider the size, 6 inches wide by 4 feet long, that&#x27;s a lot of silicone for under 70 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It&#x27;s like a big piece of tape that you wrap on to your body and won&#x27;t fall down.</li>
<li> but when I cut off a strip to put it on my scar and held it down with my medical binder or my underwear</li>
<li> The area that needed treatment was big enough that the small strips wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
<li> This belt is definitely a cheaper alternative for applying silicone sheeting on the skin, but my only complaint was that the belt is kinda \\&quot;thick\\&quot; thus making somewhat \\&quot;inflexible\\&quot;...</li>
<li> (incision/scar wraps all the way around my waist) about 12 weeks ago, and was cleared by the surgeon to begin wearing a silicone strip after 5 weeks - once the wound had fully closed.</li>
<li> But even my plastic surgeon has commented on how flat and narrow my scar is getting.</li>
<li> Even though it was 4 feet long, I cut about 16 inches off to tailor it to my waist size, leaving just a little bit of an overlap.</li>
<li> My scar (which  went from one side to the other across my abdomen) is healing &amp;#34;flat and beautiful&amp;#34; according to the doctor.</li>
<li> I wear it for 10-12 hours daily, usually through the night while resting at home and sleeping.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve not experienced that, but I wonder if it&#x27;s because others are stretching it too much and wearing it too tightly.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a little surprised by all the negative reviews for this product.</li>
<li> Having purchased this item several times from my local Medical Supply Store I was very upset to open this package today and find its a FAKE!!!</li>
<li> and now I am using the other half.</li>
<li> After I use it for a few hours, I started to feel itchy, hot and uncomfortable.</li>
<li> It stays in place and you never have to pull it up or down like the compression garments you get from the doc.</li>
<li> The silicone sheet is very thin, and we noticed a couple of tears developing within the first few days of use.</li>
<li> If you are planning to wear it for hours to half a day, this is not a product you want to use.</li>
<li> too expensive to only last a week!.</li>

    <li> started wearing this at 2 1/2 week post.wear on skin then a huge silk grandma underwear then a compresstion grament.that how i wear it 24/7.  helps you to move and feel better.help flat puck skin and smooth scar.</li>
    <li> This belt is definitely a cheaper alternative for applying silicone sheeting on the skin, but my only complaint was that the belt is kinda \\&quot;thick\\&quot; thus making somewhat \\&quot;inflexible\\&quot;...it just doesnt conform to my shape very well because it has a stiff fabric backing on the other side. I definitly can not wear it without wearing a compression garment on top because the belt will simply not stay on and adhere on its own...even with the velcro strips.     But you do get 272 square inches of silicone sheeting for 70 bucks, so I guess I cant complain too much.</li>
    <li> I purchased this belt after my surgery and began wearing it the second week after to replace my surgery garment. The delivery was quick and in a secure package. Also, it is comfortable with support needed when in the healing process. I would highly recommend to future abdominal surgery patients.</li>
    <li> It is a good binder but is pretty hot and makes me itch along my scar area.  I have used Scar Away c-section strips and they are more comfortable.  It would have been nice if the two were combined.</li>
    <li> too expensive to only last a week!. don&#x27;t think it was a real Gelzone- no labels on the product, very disappointed</li>
    <li> This silicone garmet belt is very easy to put on. It&#x27;s like a big piece of tape that you wrap on to your body and won&#x27;t fall down. However, if you are wearing it for a little while, it is ok. If you are planning to wear it for hours to half a day, this is not a product you want to use. Usually the scar is not as big as the area of the whole sheet that covers your body, but you have to cover a large area of your body in order for the velcros to secure the sheet. There will be a large area of your skin not able to breath any air for a long time. After I use it for a few hours, I started to feel itchy, hot and uncomfortable. After trying it for 3 times (I wore it for 6-8 hours per day), I started to get some rashes on my skin. After consulting with my doctor, he told me to use the small silicone strips just enough to cover the scar itself, which has been working better for me.</li>
    <li> I had abdonminal surgery at the time 4 weeks post-op. I loved the compression and that this was not so bulky. By week 2 I had a rash and itched like crazy.I used some hydrocortisone and it went away after 2-3 days . I started usinging it again right after and broke out 3 days later. I would wear it all day at work 8 hrs. I&#x27;m not sure what made me break out but when I cut off a strip to put it on my scar and held it down with my medical binder or my underwear I never broke out. I may wear it now only if I&#x27;m wearing something a bit more form fitting. It stays in place and you never have to pull it up or down like the compression garments you get from the doc.</li>
    <li> This is the second gelzone belt that I have purchased.  The first one was perfect.  It provided great support and lasted 4 weeks.  I was so pleased that I promptly ordered a second one.  I think this product has been used!  It is falling apart, in the same way that my first one did after 4 weeks!  Only I have only worn this one for two days.  I definently got a lemon, and am upset because I can&#x27;t send it back.  This is an expensive product.  I also paid for 2 day shipping and I didn&#x27;t receive the product until day 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am upset.  I really loved my first gelone belt.  I think someone has scammed me with this one though.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Gelzone and this was a no name wrap in a gelzone box. It was not the one I have seen on T.V or the picture that they have up. I paid the money for the gelzone not for a off brand wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Garrett</li>
    <li> This product was soooo much cheaper than any other silicone gel strip product.  I cut it to size for my tummy tuck scar and then for my breast implant areole scar.  Right now I&#x27;m still wearing a binder and bra all the time, but I take them off at night.  I wear them for 12-16 hours and my scars are looking great.  The binder keeps the cut strip on for now.  Later I will wear something like spanx which will keep it in place.  They are not meant to wear without something holding them in place.  If you don&#x27;t have anything you might try medical paper tape.</li>
    <li> This product has been wonderful. My surgery scars have softened and are healing. The gel belt also gives me comfort with the swelling. The product was new out of the box. I was concerned because of some negative reviews. I was able to cut the belt to make two long pieces. I just finished using one for four weeks and now I am using the other half. I wear it for 12 hours each day and wash it with gentle soap each night. I am very pleased with the gel belt and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I found this Gelzone Belt to be extremely comfortable and wore it 16 hours a day. My scar (which  went from one side to the other across my abdomen) is healing &amp;#34;flat and beautiful&amp;#34; according to the doctor.</li>
    <li> unfortunately i am unable to wear the belt due to excessive itching and rash occuring-----stayed on great--and was made well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. This is great to use in scars.</li>
    <li> Great product helped with my procedure. Affordable too. I recommended it..</li>
    <li> I love this product. I took it into my plastic surgeon and he said that this product speed up my healing.</li>
    <li> I used this shortly after a tummy tuck and loved it. I used it under my binder and not only did it help the scar bu helped with added compression. Also helped with compression after done using my binder. Washes well and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I used this Gelzone garment belt after having my c-section and it really did work. I was satisfied with the product. Bear in mind that you still need to be careful when you clean it, but if you do it right it works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little surprised by all the negative reviews for this product. While I do understand that what Amazon is actually shipping is not the official \\&quot;Gelzone\\&quot;, this silicone belt is still a really good value. When you consider the size, 6 inches wide by 4 feet long, that&#x27;s a lot of silicone for under 70 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, in my particular experience, this belt works great. I had a lower body lift (incision/scar wraps all the way around my waist) about 12 weeks ago, and was cleared by the surgeon to begin wearing a silicone strip after 5 weeks - once the wound had fully closed. This belt has been perfect for me. Even though it was 4 feet long, I cut about 16 inches off to tailor it to my waist size, leaving just a little bit of an overlap. There are two sets (4 total) of velcro strips for you to use for clasping the belt and holding it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few people have commented about how the belt rolls up or down, and that the silicone eventually stretches and rips. I&#x27;ve not experienced that, but I wonder if it&#x27;s because others are stretching it too much and wearing it too tightly. The silicone has a stickiness to it, so I just gently wrap it around my body, I do pull it a little bit when attaching the velcro, but for the most part, I&#x27;m not stretching it much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 7 weeks thus far. The company claims it will only last about 4 weeks and you need to wear silicone for 2-3 months to achieve the full benefit. I wear it for 10-12 hours daily, usually through the night while resting at home and sleeping. Then in the morning, once removed, I apply scar creme and still wear a surgical compression garmet throughout the day. Then once at home, I put the silicone belt back on. One note: this silicone belt is not designed to be worn with any type of topical lotion, scar creme or otherwise between it and the skin. Your skin should be completely dry when you put on the belt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;ve seen great results. The scar is beginning to fade - lighten in color - it&#x27;s definitely not as red, but some of that could just be attributed to natural healing over time. But even my plastic surgeon has commented on how flat and narrow my scar is getting. And with this type of scar, to me, that&#x27;s a huge plus and worth trying this belt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation (I&#x27;m a man) - give it shot, I&#x27;m very satisfied and will purchase another once this one wears out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: This belt is still working for me. Been wearing it daily for about 4 months now, and it&#x27;s just beginning to show a little wear on the ends that I overlap, which doesn&#x27;t actually touch my skin, so no worries there. Very pleased with the healing of the scar due to using this belt.</li>
    <li> This product is very uncomfortable to wear. I do see that the product keeps my scar moist and that&#x27;s why I haven&#x27;t returned it ..</li>
    <li> I could not wear this long enough to see if it works because it doesn&#x27;t stay on, which is very annoying,</li>
    <li> A lot of people have wondered if this is an authentic gelzone belt. As far as I know, it is. It arrived just the way it looks in the picture, with the  gelzone  logo and all. Its fairly comfortable and can be adjusted to to fit your level of compression. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because I did not use it long enough to test out the quality or effectiveness of the silicone. If you&#x27;ve had any sort of abdominal surgery, I would say try this belt. Anything that can help you recover faster and better is worth trying.</li>
    <li> I used after my lower body lift it smoothed the scar , however I didn&#x27;t use it for a long time because I had another surgery , that&#x27;s why the scar didn&#x27;t fade away .</li>
    <li> This Gelzone silicone sheeting worked well with an abdominal scar I had.  The area that needed treatment was big enough that the small strips wouldn&#x27;t work.  Plus because it was on my abdomen, it moved a lot.  This belt product worked well and allowed me to wrap it entirely around me.  I also was able to cut a section off to use if I didn&#x27;t want to wrap it all the way around.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how much the silicone actually helped, but I know it didn&#x27;t hurt.  And my scar is nice and flexible.  I think anything you can do to promote good healing is worth it.</li>
    <li> Having purchased this item several times from my local Medical Supply Store I was very upset to open this package today and find its a FAKE!!! What you see in the picture is the REAL Gelzone Garment Belt, however, what you will receive in the mail is a FAKE!! Dont be a victim of the classic \\&quot;bait &amp; switch\\&quot;. Buyer Beware!!!!!</li>
    <li> Genuine gel zone product as described, but couldn&#x27;t use for long.. Gave me a rash.. And made me very sweaty</li>
    <li> This is the best after surgery. Love this product and is wonderful in healing and smoothing scars</li>
    <li> Sheeting can be very expensive over a long period of time to replace, so this sheeting filled the bill as l was able to cut into strips and use as needed.  They also last really long especially if you take the time to wash and dry them carefully.  I used dial antibacterial and it was still sticky (good thing) when it dried.</li>
    <li> It riped really fast.</li>
    <li> I received the container that said Gelzone Belt, however when I opened it up it was not a gelzone belt.  It was a generic look a like.  I had to wind up ordering the real thing from another site other than amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this item form my wife to help w/scar healing after her tummy tuck. It was a great price and I thought it would make a nice &#x27;transitional&#x27; binder device after she was done using the post-surgical binder. She has been using it for the past 4 weeks (only at bedtime) and I do see some good scar healing; probably faster than it would without the silicone gel sheeting. The silicone sheet is very thin, and we noticed a couple of tears developing within the first few days of use. Now there are several large tears in the sheeting after one month use. Fortunately, the belt is wide enough that the actual scar is still covered by the silicone sheeting. I guess it will serve it&#x27;s purpose, but I am a bit disappointed in the thin layering of the silicone.</li>
