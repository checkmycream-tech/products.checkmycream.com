### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best out their.</li>
      <li>Colorfix is an excellent topcoat.  </li>
      <li>The best for keeping color on and not chipping!</li>
      <li>Your nails will look priceless and nice</li>
      <li>I did not understand the good reviews.</li>
      <li>The even crazier part is that it smells GOOD to me.  </li>
      <li>Excellent top protective top coat</li>
      <li>This IS the Holy Grail of top coats!</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s great that it is available on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I love this top coat!  </li>
      <li>But it really is the best top coat available, despite the Hazmat warnings.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m over the moon about this top coat.</li>
      <li>Love this top coat.</li>
      <li>Love this product, makes me want to do my nails, Susan Muller</li>
      <li>more then if I didn&#x27;t put anything on.  </li>
      <li>I got this top coat originally years ago at a salon in Virginia where I got my nails done a couple of times.</li>
      <li>Now rich housewives have no excuse to fly to Geneva.  </li>
      <li>I love it and it makes it fun to paint my nails.  </li>
      <li>It dries fast, goes on smoothly and does not bubble!</li>
      <li>I bought some of this topcoat there and no longer live near that salon and have not found it; I was so happy to find it on amazon as I am almost out and</li>
      <li>I used to be a Nail Tech and still use this for my own personal use.</li>
      <li>I have horrid fingernails that break and split, and this is a nice simple coating to keep them &amp;#34;together&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Thanks Mavala!</li>
      <li>I just bought this product and used it for the first time.  </li>
      <li>I love having pretty nails, but stopped painting them about a year ago because they would always chip the same or next day even with Seche Vite top coat.</li>
      <li>I have tried every top coat you can think of and this is the only one that works!</li>
      <li>This stuff really sticks!</li>
      <li>I did get a small chip on the second day, but I didn&#x27;t make any efforts to protect my polish in the kitchen, so I&#x27;m still VERY impressed.  </li>
      <li>This was my last stop before going for a gel manicure, which I&#x27;m not yet certain is safe.</li>
      <li>It also really works well on my toenails after polish.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s right - and it does indeed smell like flowers and garbage (likely because it contains benzophine, which is in the benzene helix).</li>
      <li>I used this to top red polish and it lasted pretty well even through heavy cooking and hand-washing.  </li>
      <li>I CAN&#x27;T LIVE WITHOUT IT.</li>
      <li>I will probably apply this any time I get a professional manicure, too!</li>
      <li>This polish has lasted through me picking at things, removing keys from key rings and many other activities.</li>
      <li>To me, it smells exactly like a grape jolly rancher and that&#x27;s only when I smelled it up close.  </li>
      <li>No other topcoat can deliver what this can.</li>
      <li>I barely smell it at all.</li>
      <li>I get tired of my nail color before the manicure needs touching up or redoing.  </li>
      <li>The bottle is small for $12, but worth every penny.</li>

<li> A little thick and rubbery but it works!</li>
<li> Rock hard, shiny finish.</li>
<li> My polish lasts at least 10 days sometimes for 2 weeks</li>
<li> It sucks.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t be fooled; it&#x27;s expensive and it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>

<li> It&#x27;s a piece of crap.  </li>
<li> I use Essie \\&quot;Fill the Gap\\&quot; base coat.</li>

    <li> I used this to top red polish and it lasted pretty well even through heavy cooking and hand-washing.  I did get a small chip on the second day, but I didn&#x27;t make any efforts to protect my polish in the kitchen, so I&#x27;m still VERY impressed.  I will probably apply this any time I get a professional manicure, too!</li>
    <li> I love this top coat!  It doesn&#x27;t crack like some.  Add a coat every few days for long lasting nail polish.  I use Essie \\&quot;Fill the Gap\\&quot; base coat. And Zoya polish.</li>
    <li> This IS the Holy Grail of top coats! I love having pretty nails, but stopped painting them about a year ago because they would always chip the same or next day even with Seche Vite top coat. I&#x27;ve had this on for three days now with no chipping! The bottle is small for $12, but worth every penny. I keep staring at my hands. I do a lot of crafts at home and I&#x27;m a midwife so I wash my hands and wear gloves a lot at work, which can wear on a manicure.This polish has lasted through me picking at things, removing keys from key rings and many other activities. I&#x27;m over the moon about this top coat. This was my last stop before going for a gel manicure, which I&#x27;m not yet certain is safe. Thanks Mavala!</li>
    <li> Excellent top protective top coat</li>

    <li> A little thick and rubbery but it works!</li>
    <li> I just bought this product and used it for the first time.  I can&#x27;t get over how low odor it is.  The even crazier part is that it smells GOOD to me.  To me, it smells exactly like a grape jolly rancher and that&#x27;s only when I smelled it up close.  I barely smell it at all.</li>
    <li> Love this product, makes me want to do my nails, Susan Muller</li>
    <li> I did not understand the good reviews. I used the top coat mavala colorfix and also used the mavala base coat 002 (top&lt;br /&gt;coat, nail polish and base coat) waited for dry between base coat, nail polish and top coat. My nails chips in two days.</li>
    <li> Rock hard, shiny finish. The stuff of legend.</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  No chips for 7 days!  I love it and it makes it fun to paint my nails.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It sucks.  I&#x27;m so mad I bought this.  It&#x27;s a piece of crap.  It makes my nail polish crack more then if I didn&#x27;t put anything on.  Don&#x27;t be fooled; it&#x27;s expensive and it doesn&#x27;t work.  If anything; try and buy it from a place that can be returned.</li>
    <li> This stuff really sticks! I have horrid fingernails that break and split, and this is a nice simple coating to keep them &amp;#34;together&amp;#34;. It also really works well on my toenails after polish.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s right - and it does indeed smell like flowers and garbage (likely because it contains benzophine, which is in the benzene helix). But it really is the best top coat available, despite the Hazmat warnings.  And it&#x27;s great that it is available on Amazon.  Now rich housewives have no excuse to fly to Geneva.  Just don&#x27;t bring it to Catalina Island; not sure why? Perhaps it is the catalyst for the androgynous asexual fish species featured in other films and the folks on Catalina Island ain&#x27;t got time fo dat.</li>
    <li> I have been using this polish for 12 years. Your manicure stays on and does not chip, and it stays on my toes for 1 month. It&#x27;s the best out their. I used to be a Nail Tech and still use this for my own personal use.</li>
    <li> Love this top coat. It&#x27;s thin and dries fast but still has ultra high shine. And yes ...it smells like garbage and flowers.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I never found this product before. It&#x27;s what I have been looking for. Now I can take off my acrylics and my polish will finally last longer than 2-3 days and stay shiny.</li>
    <li> Colorfix is an excellent topcoat.  I use it to extend the life of my manicure.</li>
    <li> I got this top coat originally years ago at a salon in Virginia where I got my nails done a couple of times. I bought some of this topcoat there and no longer live near that salon and have not found it; I was so happy to find it on amazon as I am almost out and other topcoats I have used can not compare.</li>
    <li> I CAN&#x27;T LIVE WITHOUT IT.</li>
    <li> Your nails will look priceless and nice</li>
    <li> I use Mavala Colorfix as basecoat and topcoat. It dries fast, goes on smoothly and does not bubble! About as durable as you can get without resorting to gel nail color, without the damage to my nails or the salon commitment or price.  I get tired of my nail color before the manicure needs touching up or redoing.  No other topcoat can deliver what this can.</li>
    <li> I have tried every top coat you can think of and this is the only one that works! My polish lasts at least 10 days sometimes for 2 weeks and I only reapply once after about 5 days. It has a brillant shine and I feel that it makes my nails stronger.</li>
