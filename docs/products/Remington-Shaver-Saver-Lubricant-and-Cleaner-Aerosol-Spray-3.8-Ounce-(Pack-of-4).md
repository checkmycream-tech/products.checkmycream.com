      <li>works great</li>
      <li>This product is great for the electric razor.</li>
      <li>A good product.</li>
      <li>So I was glad to see it available and at a good price.</li>
      <li>I tried one and since it work so well, I ordered more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m okay though.</li>
      <li>The product was what a needed but couldn&#x27;t fine,</li>
      <li>Received product quickly and well&#x3D;packaged!</li>
      <li>I have always received great service from Amazon and they sell only quality products.</li>
      <li>When you use Shaver Saver after emptying the whiskers, the blades stay lubricated and clean and you get a smooth shave.</li>
      <li>Keeps razor heads clean and lubed resulting in smoother, closer shaves.</li>
      <li>I clean the razor a couple of times a week, then spray on the foil.</li>
      <li>It helps to keep it clean and running well.</li>
      <li>but I imagine it is about as good or better than other brands.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and found it very helpful.</li>
      <li>My husband is totally satisfied with the quality of this product and the fast shipping.</li>
      <li>If you just keep emptying the whiskers, your blades will wear out quick.</li>
      <li>Seems worth the money to me to not have to buy the replacement head and foil so often.</li>

      <li>Remington Shaver Saver works real well.  </li>
      <li>While I quickly grew dissatisfied with and abandoned the shaver, because it was cheaply made and started losing its charge much too soon, I continued to use the Shaver Saver Lubricant &amp; Cleaner with the Braun shavers which I had been using previously.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several years now and it does a fantastic job of keeping the blades running smooth and sharp.  </li>
      <li>abd makes the blades last much longer</li>
      <li>The reason I ordered it in such large quantity is that I&#x27;ve had difficulty finding it in my local stores.  </li>
      <li>I find that one application per week is all that is necessary to get those ten year old shavers working like new.</li>
      <li>All you do is spray a little on the blades when you are cleaning it ,after use, and it will be ready the next time it is needed.</li>

    <li> I started using this on the foil screen of my Braun shaver. It seems to extend the life of the cutterhead and foil screen. I clean the razor a couple of times a week, then spray on the foil. Seems worth the money to me to not have to buy the replacement head and foil so often.</li>
    <li> I started using Remington Shaver Saver Lubricant &amp; Cleaner when I received a Remington electric shaver as a Christmas present. While I quickly grew dissatisfied with and abandoned the shaver, because it was cheaply made and started losing its charge much too soon, I continued to use the Shaver Saver Lubricant &amp; Cleaner with the Braun shavers which I had been using previously. I find that one application per week is all that is necessary to get those ten year old shavers working like new. Great product.</li>
    <li> this is the best shaver lubricant on the market . wal-mart use to carry it but  they stopped.  works great</li>
    <li> This product is great for the electric razor. It helps to keep it clean and running well. All you do is spray a little on the blades when you are cleaning it ,after use, and it will be ready the next time it is needed. Remington has always had great products and this is one of them. I received this product before the date that was given to me. I have always received great service from Amazon and they sell only quality products. I recommend this shaver saver lubricant and cleaner to anyone that uses an electric razor</li>

    <li> I ordered four Remington Shaver Savers and got 3 Remington Shaver Savers and One Norelco Shaver  Lubricant which offers far less than the expected results. I&#x27;m okay though.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely a must for a non-self-cleaning electric razor. If you just keep emptying the whiskers, your blades will wear out quick.

    <li> Always a very good product</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a number of years on my Norelco Triple head razor and like the way it works. It is becoming difficult to find locally and this purchase of a multi-pack was convenient.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST way to keep your shaver in tip-top shape!</li>
    <li> This was for my husband.  He had been looking in all the stores around where he use to purchase this item, but could not find it.&lt;br /&gt;I suggested looking on Amazon and we found it, so he is now happy.  It helps his shaver move and shave closer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and found it very helpful. I intend to keep it with me as long as I need it.</li>
