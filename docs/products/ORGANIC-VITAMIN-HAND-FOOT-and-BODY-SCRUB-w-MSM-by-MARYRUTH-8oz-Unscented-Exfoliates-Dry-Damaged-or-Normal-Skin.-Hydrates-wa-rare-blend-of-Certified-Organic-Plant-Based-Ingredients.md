<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I never thought an unscented body scrub could feel so luxurious and be so moisturizing until I tried this scrub. The product contains no artificial colors or artificial perfumes which means I don&#x27;t have to be concerned about something unnatural being absorbed through the skin. Great for exfoliating the feet, elbows, knees and hands. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  It is amazing for hands and the entire body.  I even use it to exfoliate my face.  It leaves a silk, sweet finish to the skin.  You almost want to eat it!</li>
    <li> This scrub works so well! It leaves my hands so smooth and youthful looking! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Especially used with MaryRuth Hsnd cream a must for smooth skin - easy &amp; uplifting. I&#x27;m ordering for Mother&#x27;s Day</li>
    <li> MaryRuth&#x27;s hand and body scrub is fantastic. It&#x27;s perfect - not too rough but very cleansing - I would recommend this to everyone, especially for summer!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember how my hands felt like when i was a baby, but after using the scrub and the lotion i think its the closets possible :) just amazing stuff!</li>
    <li> I purchased my organic vitamin scrub about 40 days ago. I absolutely love it!  You only need a little amount to be affective.  It leaves your skin soft and doesn&#x27;t leave a Greasy residual on your skin. I leave mine next to my kitchen sink and use it on my hands on a daily basis!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Massaging hands and body with Mary Ruth&#x27;s scrub is like a therapy for your mind. Eases your head and releases tensions after a long day. Brings you back to a state of peace, harmony and love btwn the body and mind. Skin feels so soft and healthy after use. Amazing in combination with Mary Ruth&#x27;s hand cream. High recommend.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible product. I&#x27;ve never used a hand scrub before but I&#x27;m hooked on this one. Bottom line - hands feel silky smooth and totally invigorated after using.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Ok, you&#x27;d normally not see me using a scrub. I&#x27;ve been a basic soap and water guy. But my girlfriend insisted on me trying this for my &amp;#34;she says&amp;#34; - rough hands. Gotta say, I love this stuff. My hands feel SO much better after using it compared to soap. Really clean and not dried out. Wish I had listened to her sooner. So, just saying, if you&#x27;re a guy and reading this, definitely give it a try, you&#x27;ll notice the difference immediately.</li>
    <li> Love the MaryRuth organic body scrub! Use it every day!!!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing body scrub.  I recently moved and have been furiously cleaning, making my hands so dry and rough.  This is the only product that actually made a noticeable difference immediately after using!!!!  I was thoroughly impressed and highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> So easy to use &amp; my hands look so great most what i love about is what it&#x27;s made of . Feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Took with me rafting down the Colorado River and camping for 3 days to the bottom of the Grand Canyon. The product did everything it promised.I would highly recommend it to anyone !!!</li>

    <li> My wife bought this hand cream and scrub, and my hands were so dry I decided to try it too. The results were smooth and relief! Shhh don&#x27;t tell her I used it. Now I order my own!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate in purchasing this.  I have my hands in water all day working with kids and cooking. This is my hand saver.  It moisturizes as it exfoliates.  And it is organic and natural so I know I am taking care of my health while taking care of my hands.  Leaves hand soft and smooth!  The best.</li>
    <li> MaryRuth Hand scrub is truly transforming and worth it. Makes a big difference on your hands and lets your skin detoxify without drying it, but on the opposite side hydrates it. The ingredients in this product are truly organic and chemical free and I don&#x27;t believe you will find another one like this on the market today, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Loved this product!  Just a little bit will deliver a youthful glow to your hands.  It very oily at first BUT absorbs amazingly! My hands look fresh from the exfoliation and moisturized perfectly after without any oily residue and it&#x27;s organic!</li>
    <li> I love this Organic Vitamin Hand &amp; Body Scrub With MSM by MARYRUTH. The MSM has 7 key benifits:&lt;br /&gt;-Assisting in the breaking up of unhealthy calcium deposits deep within the body that are often the root cause of degenerative diseases&lt;br /&gt;-Improving joint flexibility&lt;br /&gt;-Reducing pain and swelling&lt;br /&gt;-Reducing stiffness&lt;br /&gt;-Improving circulation&lt;br /&gt;-Improving cell vitality&lt;br /&gt;-Increasing the capability of the cells that are within the skin to flush out excess fluids and toxins&lt;br /&gt;-Assisting in the gradual healing of Psoriasis, Eczema, Rosacea, Dermatitis &amp; Acne.&lt;br /&gt;Since I began using this amazing product, my skin is super soft. There is never a greasy residue left on my skin. I love the scent. It is a very light, kind of fruity scent. The ingredients are all non-toxic, and promote the organic lifestyle.  It is working great for me, and I would definitely recommend this to everyone! Definitely 5/5&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review</li>
    <li> This is my first MaryRuth organics product but I know for sure it wont be my last. With a dog and two kids, I am always washing my hands, all day it seems. I used this once when it first came and it was AMAZING. It didn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling greasy like other scrubs that I have tried. It exfoliated my hands and left them feeling really clean and soft. It says that there is a light scent, but I didn&#x27;t smell anything at all. My boyfriend works construction and always has dry gross hands. I made him use this right after I did, and he liked it too!!

    <li> I have learned that exfoliation is a key part to healthy skin. However, some products that exfoliate also leave your skin dried out. Not this one! After using this product my hands were so soft and moisturized that I did not even need to use lotion. The vitamin E and vitamin B oils that are in this scrub heal, protect and moisturize your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The granules of 100% all natural and organic sugar in this scrub are larger than that of a grain of table sugar, it is more like raw sugar and they work wonders! This is another way you know that this is a high quality product!I wish I could buy this stuff by the gallon to use in the shower everyday. Yes, it&#x27;s that good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you open your jar of hand and body scrub you may want to get a spoon and stir it up because the oils get a little separated in shipping, more proof of how natural this product is!

What&#x27;s not to love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it didn&#x27;t burn or irritate my sensitive skin at all. I paired it with the MaryRuth Organics Hydrating Hand Cream and my hands are so incredibly smooth!&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you open it carefully with the jar sitting flat on the counter --I tore into it and slopped some oil out of the jar. Not a complaint at all, I&#x27;m just a bull in a china shop ;) Just thought I would warn others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a discount on this in exchange for my honest review, and I honestly love it!</li>
    <li> We have been using MaryRuth Organics Hand Cream and Vitamin Scrub. We love the texture and feel of these products and have never been disappointed with a MaryRuth Organics product. The results are wonderful. You won&#x27;t know what you are missing if you don&#x27;t try them.</li>
