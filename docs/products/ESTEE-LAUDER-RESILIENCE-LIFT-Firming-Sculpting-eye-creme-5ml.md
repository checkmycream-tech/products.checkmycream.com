    <li> I forgot to notice the quantity.  That was disappointing after thinking that I was getting a really great deal on an Estee Lauder product.  Oh well, life is a lesson.  It is too soon to judge the product and decide whether I will get it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it every day and have for years. My skin loves it.  Pleasant smell. Pleasant feel. People tell me I look good. I love the small jars--great for travel.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order this but I did. It has to be old. Mascara is dried out or very little in it. The words are faded off the jars.&lt;br /&gt;Service was great. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Great price for such a good cream.</li>
    <li> This helps with soothing my eyes after wearing eyeliner &amp; mascara. I love the pink &amp; gold of the container. I stocked up on 2. Thanks, Amazon!</li>
