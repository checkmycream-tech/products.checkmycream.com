      <li>others with sensitive skin have had great results with Purpose, but I just didn&#x27;t in the end.</li>

      <li>Great product - simple and protects from UVA rays.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and non greasy and protects my skin.</li>
      <li>I used to have an Amazon subscription to this but for some reason it was no longer available that way.</li>
      <li>It goes on light and is not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light on the skin and makeup stays put all day.  </li>
      <li>I have fair, sensitive, acne prone skin, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate it one bit.</li>
      <li>Only 15 SPF calls for extra protection,but the light feeling after applying is very welcome.</li>
      <li>I recall reading some reviews several years ago that said the recipe had changed and the product wasn&#x27;t as good.</li>
      <li>Seems like good, simple ingredients.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it does make your face feel greasy and it is very light also has sunscreen everyone should wear when outside</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
      <li>The consistency is nice; it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy after application, and it&#x27;s just enough to keep my face feeling moisturized.  </li>
      <li>A dermatologist recommended this to me many years ago because I have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Personally i use it right after i shave in the morning and also apply it at night after i shower and before going to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The price is right on, too.</li>
      <li>It smells so clean and makes applying my foundation much easier.  </li>
      <li>Nice daily face cream with a little SPF for good measure.</li>
      <li>Great cleared acne within a few weeks!</li>
      <li>My face was doing pretty well with keeping away acne before this moisturizer</li>
      <li>be aware.</li>
      <li>This pair split at the seam the first time I wore them.</li>
      <li>Since I use the Purpose Cleanser, I saw the positive reviews on this product and thought, why not?</li>
      <li>It has an SPF which I really like.  </li>
      <li>not oily and moisturizes very well, along with having SPF-15 protection.&lt;br</li>
      <li>No irritating scent, and gentle on the skin.</li>
      <li>Excellent sunscreen,never makes you feel sticky or dirty.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth a try if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and MAY work for you if you do.</li>
      <li>The price went up significantly (almost double)</li>
      <li>This product does its job, but I wish it were a little less greasy and more apt in making my skin softer.</li>
      <li>I typically don&#x27;t use primer anyway, but it feels like I have and makes my foundation go on very smooth after application.</li>
      <li>Terrific moisturizer - one of the most essential products I have.</li>
      <li>I work in a hospital where temperature never goes high.</li>
      <li>The price was right, it spread like a dream, and my sensitive combination skin felt soft and well-moisturized all day without shine (and I live in Florida, so that&#x27;s saying something).</li>
      <li>I agree with other reviewers, it&#x27;s a straightforward product that does what it says, and at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>It definitely has a sunscreen smell, and feels more thick than I typically like for daily moisturizing, but it dries well and really does a great job of priming for makeup.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is light-weight and wonderful. Gentle and yet keeps your face looking good, protected from the sun and not looking greasy. Dermatologist recommended, especially if you use Retin-A.</li>
    <li> I use purpose face wash and lotion daily.  I think it is a great straight forward product.  Never have had any issues and it was what was recommended 16 years ago as a pimple faced teenager by my dermatologist.  Have used the face wash every day since for 16 years and my skin has always looked great, felt clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price on Amazon is great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years, the only one I buy. No irritating scent, and gentle on the skin. Doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out and great knowing I am wearing spf. I put it on every morning after I wash my face.</li>
    <li> LOVE this moisturizer. Feels great and mixes well with foundation! Better than expensive options! The price is right on, too. I have tried a lot of expensive creams and I prefer everything about this one. Trust me, Get it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, it absorbs quickly so I can get right to my make- up or crawl into bed without waiting for it to dry!</li>
    <li> It works about as well as Clinique Acne Solutions for about a third of the cost and one less step. That is, I combined this with the Purpose soap.</li>
    <li> Seems like good, simple ingredients.  Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, or oily, but doesn&#x27;t feel watery, either.  Nice daily face cream with a little SPF for good measure.</li>
    <li> I use this day and night. I have fair, sensitive, acne prone skin, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate it one bit. This product does its job, but I wish it were a little less greasy and more apt in making my skin softer.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great if you have oily skin.  It is the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t make me shine like the sun.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years and have been extremely happy.&lt;br /&gt;Its not oily and moisturizes very well, along with having SPF-15 protection.&lt;br /&gt;Personally i use it right after i shave in the morning and also apply it at night after i shower and before going to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive facial skin and this has never done me wrong.&lt;br /&gt;definitely would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.  I&#x27;ve tried other products but always go back to the Purpose brand.  It&#x27;s light on the skin and makeup stays put all day.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> Awesome face cream, can&#x27;t find in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I wear it every day on face and exposed parts of body.  It&#x27;s light and non greasy and protects my skin. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This lotion leaves my face feeling moisturized but not greasy at all.  It does smell like sunscreen if that would be a problem for you.  It hasn&#x27;t given me any breakouts and a small pump goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is my fave lotion for my face. It&#x27;s so hard to find, a little pricey online, but well worth it!</li>
    <li> Have been using it as a moisturizer for my fair,sensitive skin for 3 years.Smell is ok for me , liquid not creamy- thick,but stays put under my foundation even when my face is sweating.Only 15 SPF calls for extra protection,but the light feeling after applying is very welcome.</li>
    <li> This was another product I looked forward to receiving and was unfortunetely let down. I am not a daily SPF wearer and recently I felt like trying something new on my skin with SPF in it. Since I use the Purpose Cleanser, I saw the positive reviews on this product and thought, why not? I gave it a try and (by the way, I do use foundation and it did not blend well) maybe it had a reaction to type of makeup I use because it left these white \\&quot;crusts\\&quot; on my face after applying my makeup. Either way, it was just not the thing for me and I decided to stick with Ceaphil&#x27;s moisturizer. If there are any suggestions for makeup that reacts well with this product, I would greatly appreciate reccomendations.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for over 10 years. My doctor recommended this because of all the acne creams I used dried out my face. Could find it in stores anymore and am so glad I found it here.</li>
    <li> use this product as a soothing after shave lotion us it&#x27;s an SPF 25 for sun screen</li>
    <li> when i left N.Y.C. to go to AZ i asked my dermatologist what face cream to use and and he recommended Purpose because of the SPF15.  i have used it now for 22 years and have been very satisfied. i don&#x27;t understand why stores like Walgreen and CVS don&#x27;t carry anymore</li>
    <li> Best day moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer about 12 years.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily and does not cause breakouts.  It doesn&#x27;t have any scent which is nice.  It has an SPF which I really like.  I recommend this lotion.  I even use it on my hands and arms every day.</li>
    <li> the very best in moisterizer and sun blocker...i have been using it for years and has kept my youthful, moist healthy.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and as soon a I started using this product, my face broke out very badly. I thought the breakout might have been due to other factors, so I kept using the product for a month. As soon as I discontinued using it, my face cleared up. When I searched the ingredients list to try to figure out what might have caused the trouble, I realized that none of the inactive ingredients are listed on the bottle.</li>
    <li> Prescribed by my dermatologist to use as a moisturizer under my foundation and at night. I have used this product for years. This gives you the moisture you need without a heavy or greasy feel. Foundation goes on easily. Great product and reasonability priced. You won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> A dermatologist recommended this to me many years ago because I have sensitive skin.  I put this on along with Olay eye serum after my shower.  It soaks in well so that by the time I finish brushing my teeth I can use Olay touch of foundation moisturizer at the start of my makeup.  Two moisturizers may seem a bit excessive, but it never feels heavy or greasy and at my age I need all the moisture I can get!</li>
    <li> In my work, I am in and out of my car five days a week. I apply another sunscreen, Aveeno Positively Ageless, SPF 30, at the start of the day, then apply Purpose Dual Treatment Moisture Lotion at least twice in the afternoon. I love it. I have dry, sensitive skin and the extra applications of this product help keep my skin moist and dewy. I agree with other reviewers, it&#x27;s a straightforward product that does what it says, and at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This is the best face moisturizer! Love that it has SPF built in. I recall reading some reviews several years ago that said the recipe had changed and the product wasn&#x27;t as good. I haven&#x27;t found that to be the case and I am happy the recipe seems to be the same! I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do if I had to find something else. I&#x27;ve used this lotion since 2003! I&#x27;ve recommended this stuff to dozens of friends who also use it now. I&#x27;ve only had one friend who said, &amp;#34;it feels too greasy.&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t know what they meant. I even lived abroad for 2 years and brought enough to supply my two years abroad, just in case this lotion was unavailable there and I&#x27;m glad I did, because it wan&#x27;t available. I find that when the pump stops working, that if I leave it in a plastic cup - upside down and under the sink, that I can continue to use the lotion by unscrewing the cap and wiping the plastic straw on my face. This can add several additional MONTHS of use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a shiseido daily moisturizer for the past few years, but it&#x27;s been discontinued. I decided to try this as an interim moisturizer until I find my new cult-favorite, and for the price, this does the job. It definitely has a sunscreen smell, and feels more thick than I typically like for daily moisturizing, but it dries well and really does a great job of priming for makeup. I typically don&#x27;t use primer anyway, but it feels like I have and makes my foundation go on very smooth after application. While I don&#x27;t think this is going to replace my shiseido moisturizer, it does the job.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this moisturizer. The price was right, it spread like a dream, and my sensitive combination skin felt soft and well-moisturized all day without shine (and I live in Florida, so that&#x27;s saying something). But within a few weeks I started developing redness and a slight burning sensation that I couldn&#x27;t ignore. Nothing else in my skincare or medication regimen had changed, so I concluded it was a reaction to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many others with sensitive skin have had great results with Purpose, but I just didn&#x27;t in the end. Like anything else that goes on your skin, you have to try it yourself to determine if it&#x27;s best for you. I&#x27;m giving this three stars because I really loved it before I started reacting to it and you can&#x27;t beat the value. It&#x27;s worth a try if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and MAY work for you if you do. In the meantime, my quest for a perfect moisturizer continues.</li>
    <li> Excellent sunscreen,never makes you feel sticky or dirty. Protects for hours.</li>
    <li> Great cleared acne within a few weeks!</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for more than 15 years and love it. I even have all of my adult children using it and four of them are males.</li>
    <li> Great product - simple and protects from UVA rays. Does not try to oversell itself, but does what it says. Good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used cheap skin care products and expensive products. This one works! It is gentle, non-greasy, unscented and completely wonderful for my skin. I also use the Purpose gel cleanser. They both have allowed me great skin. I hope it works well for you too!</li>
    <li> On the advice of a dermatologist, I began using this about 20 years ago. It has everything you need to protect your skin without being harsh. I used to have an Amazon subscription to this but for some reason it was no longer available that way. The price went up significantly (almost double) but it&#x27;s still worth it. A small bottle lasts a long time so even at the current price it works out to about two dollars a month. You can use cheaper products but none as good as this. Your skin is not something to skimp on.</li>
    <li> A make-up artist who did my wedding make-up suggested this product to me as an alternative to a more expensive face cream I was using before. I really liked it at first - it seemed to be light, non-sticky, and it felt good when I was applying it on my face. But in a few days I started noticing something that had never happened before - my skin became really OILY. Wiping the oil away wouldn&#x27;t help a bit - my skin would produce some more oil just a few minutes later! I have to mention, that I am not talking about staying outside under the sun, when the sweating of the skin is a normal response. I work in a hospital where temperature never goes high. I do have a combined skin (normal + oily in the T-zone), and it does become oily when I am under the bright sun, which is OK with me. But I am not ready to wipe the oil off my face every 10 minutes at work or any other place I go to during the day.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if this moisturizer will work better during winter time, so I decided to save it and give it another try in a few months. So far, I am moving to the moisturizer I was using before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and I love it! I am in my mid-thirties and have acne-prone, sensitive skin and I also suffer from eczema. This is the best daytime moisturizer with sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. No burning, no irritation, no sunscreen smell. I do wish the SPF was higher but not enough to switch! Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really surprised that there are not more reviews for this lotion. I had a neighbor that was a dermatologist recommended I use this product when I was suffering with acne as a young girl. It goes on light and is not greasy at all. Alittle goes a long way and it penetrates quickly. This stuff has never cause me to break out. Over the years I have tried different face lotions. (When it works, why change?) But always ended up with a break out and coming back to this lotion. I also have used the face wash for the same length of time. LOVE that stuff. Gives me a nice clean face.</li>
    <li> I love this moisture lotion.  It smells so clean and makes applying my foundation much easier.  I have tried every product on the market and this is by far the best!</li>
    <li> Buen precio, entrega rapida y en perfectas condiciones. Producto hidratante con proteccion solar,  de primera linea para uso diario. Lo recomiendo</li>
    <li> I love the way it does make your face feel greasy and it is very light also has sunscreen everyone should wear when outside</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. Been using this product for years and it lasts me for a very long time so the price for it is perfect considering how long it last.</li>
    <li> Perfect to use after cleansing your face. Good sun screen. Your face doesn&#x27;t feel dried out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years after my co-worker told me about it. I absolutely love it - it moisturizes my face so well...I use it each morning and usually at night too. My face is really sensitive to anything - and get this - this lotion is awesome because it will not give you a rash!  It&#x27;s nice and creamy too! :) A must have.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and have been using this as part of my post-shower routine to moisturize my face.  The formula definitely changed a few years ago - the scent was noticeably more like sunblock than it was before.  The consistency is nice; it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy after application, and it&#x27;s just enough to keep my face feeling moisturized.  I&#x27;ve tried several other face lotions over the years, many specifically for sensitive skin, and they&#x27;ve felt greasy or have been too perfume-y and I keep going back to Purpose.</li>
    <li> This product is a good moisturizer but I felt that it made my skin a little bit oily. It was okay during the day but I&#x27;ve stopped wearing the moisturizer to bed because it made me break out. I just use Aveeno for my face before bed now. During the day I do have to dab my face with blotting paper to lessen the oiliness of my face. My face was doing pretty well with keeping away acne before this moisturizer so I guess I&#x27;ll just be using it less.</li>
    <li> Glad I could get this at Amazon.  This product is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;My granddaughter and I use this all the time.  I&#x27;ve never&lt;br /&gt;been someone who is constantly changing facial products.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t remember when I started using this but this works&lt;br /&gt;wonders for my skin.</li>
    <li> Its a great lotion.  I use it on my face for hydration after my glycolic peels and it moisturizes great. Its a small bottle compared to most lotions but will last a long time depending on what you use it for.  I will always use Purpose!</li>
    <li> Terrific moisturizer - one of the most essential products I have. Good sun protection and fragrance-free. A dermatologist friend agreed that this is one of the best moisturizers, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> this is not the same formula it used to be. be aware. it now has a scent and different chemicals. read other reviews on this product by other sellers here at amazon. you have been warned&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wait edit review may 31 2013: I checked at Wal-Mart for the heck of it and they seemed to have changed it back. no scent again and the texture is the same as it used to be. I noticed the bottle now says \\&quot;see new drug facts\\&quot; on the upper right corner of the label.</li>
    <li> I liked the weight of these. I have another pair that I bought a few years ago and they are fine. This pair split at the seam the first time I wore them. I bought a medium because I don&#x27;t like running tights so snug .</li>
