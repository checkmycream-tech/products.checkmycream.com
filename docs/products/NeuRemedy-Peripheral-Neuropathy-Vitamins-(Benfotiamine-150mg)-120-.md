    <li> At last something to rave about for Neuropathy.  This is the best products.  Why didn&#x27;t my doctor recommend this sooner?  Huge help when taken as prescribed.  Once this builds up in your system and your body gets what it needs... You are good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great ...</li>
    <li> It will take the pain away! Start with 2pills and then go to 1pill; it is doctor approved.  Need I say more?</li>
    <li> It seem&#x27;s that it has helped my neurophathy. I am planning to continue this product.I am quite satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> NeuRemedy did not meet my expcations.&lt;br /&gt;It just didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;But I would not tell someone else not to&lt;br /&gt;use the product. It just might work for them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give this product a 5-star rating, but it doesn&#x27;t totally eliminate my problem...&lt;br /&gt;but it is a huge help.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for a while now and can&lt;br /&gt;feel the difference if don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Introduced to this by my podiatrist for shooting, searing pains in feet almost every night,&lt;br /&gt;and sometimes during the day. Since I have been taking this, I no longer have nightly pain.&lt;br /&gt;There is some but only on occasion, and during the day it is much more rare. I&#x27;m very happy&lt;br /&gt;and very relieved with the results.</li>
    <li> This product does not seem to work for me. It is really hard to tell how well it doers work as my neuropathy is very bad. Maybe I feel a small amount of relief but not enough to warrant the cost of the product.</li>
    <li> I had both chemo therapy and high glucose resulting in neuropathy in the feet.  I was walking everyday but not comfortably and tiring soon.  The podiatrist I am seeing gave me a bottle of the NeuRemedy Benfotiamine  which relieved a lot of my discomfort after the first bottle.  Being out of town and out of Benfotiamine, I looked it up on line and easily found it, and ordered a bottle.  I am continuing to take two capsules per day and am walking much more comfortably now, although the neuropathy is not gone entirely. I am about 70% better.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my podiatrist and seems to be working!  I have ordered 2 times and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This product is a godsend for me in the way it helps my neuropathy. No burning or itching. Still have numbness but it comes and goes. Was recommended by my Doctor and it really works. The best part is that it is a vitamin which helps the neuropathy. I would highly recommend it to any one having the same condition as I.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product for anyone suffering from foot neuropathy.  It has lessened the burning discomfort plus the tingling sensation in the toes and feet.  These symptoms seemed to happen at night so now I sleep better.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  I bought this for my Mother, who had neuropathy, and couldn&#x27;t stand it.  It got rid of the neuropathy pain and keeps the blood surgars down.  It has done eveything that it said it would do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> This seems to work ok, it was recommended by my podiatrist I still have tingling but nothing like it use to be.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My legs, feet, arms, hands, and face are definitely affected with Peripheral Neuropathy.  My walking and standing ability have been affected.  Since  I began taking 4 of these NeuRemedy pils every day for 3 months, my walking and standing abilitites are stronger, and the effect of Peripheral Neuropathy  is not as strong as it had been for many years.&lt;br /&gt;  Because of the help I have received from these capsules, I will continue taking them 4 times every day.</li>
    <li> Some of my friends had tried this product and it helped with their neuropathy.  However, it did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
    <li> Exceptional product have not seen anything better in the  market&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helps control my neuropathy pain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you increase the dose</li>
    <li> have used this before but I was getting it from the doctor that i don&#x27;t go to no more so was glad to find it on here.i would recommend this to anyone who has this problem</li>
    <li> My husband has peripheral neuropathy and has been suffering from severe burning in his feet.  Since taking this for about two weeks he has noticed a lessening in the pain and burning.  It was recommended by his podiatrist.</li>
    <li> This product has helped my feet.  It&#x27;s far better than neuroton. Too bad doctors can&#x27;t prescribe this.  They should at least acknowledge it.</li>
    <li> Great Product!&lt;br /&gt;Great Service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that it is worth a try; you have nothing to lose but pain.</li>
