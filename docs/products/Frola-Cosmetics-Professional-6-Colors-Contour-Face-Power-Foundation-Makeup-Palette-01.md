<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this palette, it lasts a long time, mildly pigmented (which I prefer for contouring) and the colors suit my skin tone.</li>
    <li> One of the colors broke, it was the pink blush thing, I would have nevered used it on myself but it would have been nice to have.</li>
    <li> pleased with this product.reccomend!</li>
    <li> The product is cheap for a reason</li>
    <li> I LOVE this palette. First off, I did receive my package with one broken powder. I was able to fix it and glad I kept it because it is a good quality powder. I am no where close to being fair skinned; I wear a NC 40-42 in Mac Cosmetics Foundation. I can contour with this and I use the top right one for my setting powder. It does a better job for my skin than any of my Mac powders do. I am ordering my second palette soon.</li>
    <li> Took forever to get and it had 2 pink colors instead of what it said. The case was cracked too. But I learned to love it and it&#x27;s bigger than I expected.</li>
    <li> I like the range of shades.  These are large sizes and a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> when i got it in the mail the 3rd one on the top was broken and everywhere but i fixed it. havent tried it on my face yet. so we will see!</li>
    <li> was broken when I received it</li>
    <li> This is a huge contour palette. Price, size and quality is awesome! Very pleased</li>
    <li> Produce arrived as depicted. (I noticed some of the posts mentioned it traveling from Shanghai and being in crumbs, but my order was fulfilled by Amazon in US and was on time and fine.) So far I&#x27;ve only used the white and darkest shade for highlighting and contouring. I like the white a lot. It provides nice highlight without being stark. The dark is not really dark enough to show up. I&#x27;m sporting the remnants of a spring break tan so my skin is darker than normal.</li>
    <li> Product came as shown. Colors are great. Easy to apply and lasts most of the day. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I really like the true brown color.  The colors blend well.</li>
    <li> It was alright. Not pigmented a lot though.</li>
    <li> Arrived cracked and broken with powder everywhere. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love this pallet it works perfectly</li>
    <li> I bought this cause i wanted to start learning and practicing contouring and highlighting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Havent mastered that yet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this applys wonderful</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s bad but not for people of color. It makes you look like a ghost</li>
    <li> when taken out of the box there was powder all over it(including the bubble wrap) and it made a mess. When I open it I could tell the powder was cheep. When I lifted it at a slight angle to get ready to use it one of the pods flopped out. It reminds me of one of those really cheep makeup sets you can get at a discount store that, the type that really shouldn&#x27;t be considered make up. It was the first thing I have ever returned to Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not that impressed with this. The powders didn&#x27;t seem to last on my face even with primer. I probably won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> The reviews were correct. This is an incredible pallet for an incredible value</li>
    <li> Honestly a waste of money . The powders have no consistency</li>
    <li> this is good to have for a makeup kit to work with different types of skin colors for contouring, it&#x27;s not an anastasia beverly hills contour palette but it&#x27;s a cheapy version of it and it does do the job</li>
    <li> I love this contour set. I have the IT cosmetic brand contour and the Frola is just as good for a lot less money.</li>
    <li> Nice Pallete for the price. I didn&#x27;t realize you could choose which color you get in the drop down menu. I thought I was getting one with only neutral colors but mine ended up having four skin tones and two blushes. The blushes are cute colors but are horrible to apply and VERY pigmented. I tried it once and I&#x27;ll never try them again. These powders do smell and are a little difficult to blend but nothing to impossible. They cost next to nothing and come from China so I don&#x27;t understand what other reviewers were complaining about.</li>
    <li> bought this and headed straight to youtube to learn how to use it. it&#x27;s excellent!</li>
    <li> I like the darker shades, but don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;m able to really achieve the highlight/contouring look that I see all over Pinterest</li>
    <li> This product doesnt even work. I try to put it on my makeup brush and try to put it on my face but nothing shows up. Recommend not buying.</li>
    <li> Larger product than expected. The pigment isn&#x27;t very strong, and doesn&#x27;t seem to stay very well.</li>
    <li> Looked just as it was pictured! Took a long time to get, but I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> Great size. Powder pallet&lt;br /&gt;Came dirty on the outside and in side. Good color pigment. One color came with a finger mark or something.</li>
    <li> I love this set. I can hardly believe I got it on the cheap. It stays really well, even on my oily skin and hasn&#x27;t broken me out. Its not gonna fit in a regular little makeup bag, though. This thing is huge! I think it will last a really long time. The colors are perfect for me. I have moderately fair Caucasian skin. The color is also buildable. Its not overly pigmented, which keeps it from looking masky and makes it blend well. I would say that a medium or tanned Caucasian could probably use it, they would just have to build up the darker color in the spots they really wanna contour. There&#x27;s plenty of it, so apply away!</li>
    <li> One of the makeup circles was completely destroyed. there was makeup everywhere, even on the outside of the packaging.</li>
    <li> Good Product. The powder is finely milled, and goes on silky when applied with a brush.  Not heavily pigmented, but the color is  buildable, which is something I like in a face powder.  The only problem was the darkest disk was broken when i opened the package.  Seems they skimped on the packaging/case to carry the savings over to the consumer.  Still a bummer, thus only the three-star rating.  I would pay a few dollars more for quality packaging.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t express how amazing this palette is. I use a face primer as a base otherwise any powder will look chalky. It blends so well. I only receive compliments on how my skin looks on the days I use this palette. I would recommend this to anyone who has a skin type similar to mine- not too dry and not overly oily.</li>
    <li> Excellent for contouring. Very generous portions.</li>
    <li> This product arrived in pieces I never got to use it!  It was broken!</li>
    <li> Just as good as Anastasia contour-kit. Very pigmented</li>
    <li> the makeup came leaky out all over the case</li>
    <li> Larger than expected, and a good product.</li>
    <li> My daughter was completely  thrilled with her contour makeup.</li>
    <li> Half of it arrived as loose powder. 😯</li>
    <li> Why  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, because I hoped it contain more quantity of each tone. It&#x27;s good for its price.</li>
    <li> Ehh... Most of the disks are ok, but a couple of them are completely broken up. I would replace it, but it would most likely just happen again, not worth my time. Certainly dissapointing.</li>
    <li> Came on time... colors were safely packaged and no damage or cracks in powders. Looks more neutral in real life. Pictures look slightly more warm</li>
    <li> I really love this palette. It&#x27;s great for my pale skin, and gives me so much control over my contour! It also really huge. I was surprised! It&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
    <li> Much bigger than what I expected.  So far its good but haven&#x27;t used it enough to say its GREAT!</li>
    <li> Not highly pigmented, slight perfumed smell. More product than I was expecting. Good for the price!</li>
    <li> These powders are ok for contouring, but they have an &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; smell to them. If they were unscented I would probably give 4 stars. They&#x27;re not fantastic, just good - but for $10, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> The pallete itself is made cheap, but I mean the colors go on good and it&#x27;s worth it for 10 bucks.</li>
    <li> Wonderful setting powder!</li>
    <li> This is a supposed &#x27;Anastasia Powder Contour Kit&#x27;. It is not an exact dupe but it is very similar. The overall product is very nice. I use this everyday. The powder doesn&#x27;t look cakey on your face and has good pigmentation. I am in the shade m30-m35 I&#x27;m Mac and this does look good on my skin. Even the dark brown in the palette. I would recommend this to anyone w/ my skintone or lighter and I would definitely buy this again especially for the price!!</li>
    <li> They had a horrible smell to it.  Couldn&#x27;t even use them and had to toss. I give it no stars</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this out, when it came it was a little cracked but not a big deal. I like it for the most part, my biggest complaint is that it wears off easily. I will still use it though</li>
    <li> A bit chalky but overall good for the price.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to see how large the product was! I had previously ordered a cream set, used one color once and in the bottom drawer it went. These go on perfectly, easy to blend and the perfect colors for someone who is fair like myself. I&#x27;d definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> Wayy bigger than I though but good stuff it&#x27;s kinda light wearing but it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> The lighter shades are too light for me. I have Olive skin and the shades appear whitish on me.</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s one of the color matches my skin tone perfectly so I use it as a powder too. It&#x27;s well pigmented and it&#x27;s bigger than you expect which was surprising. It will Deff last me a while. Only $10 you should deff try it!</li>
    <li> Just received my item in the mail and the make up is busted. The white powder at the top was everywhere!</li>
    <li> The colors were too orange for me.  There is only 2 of the colors that I can actually use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice, big set of contour powder. The white is a little too white and the yellow doesn&#x27;t give much of a highlight for my light to medium skin tone. I would recommend getting a highlighter instead of using those colors. The dark shades are nice, they blend easily. Overall it is a good, cheap option.</li>
    <li> Do not buy. Product colors are like something out of a crayon box. Product is oily and arrived completely broken.</li>
    <li> Not at all what expected. I&#x27;m a light brown skin complexion and this went on my skin sheer. No matter how much I packed on nothing showed up. This product is made for porcelain complexion. If your you have a dark/tan skin tone this product is not for you.</li>
    <li> Great but i thought it was going to be a small portable pallet and it turned out to be huge!</li>
    <li> My first stab at contouring and I read many Amazon reviews before I tried it this one. I also was nervous not to spend too much on something I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like. I LOVE IT and I think this product is a big part of my good experience. TIP: Get a good brush! This palette works great for me, I have fair skin.</li>
    <li> Love this, last pretty much all day(as long as you dont touch your face to often.) Arrived very quickly nothing broken.</li>
    <li> Colors are not even close to photo. Cheap packaging. Wouldn&#x27;t buy product again.</li>
    <li> I have not used it yet but the quality from trying it on my hand seems really pigmented! Im not an expert and wanted to try conturing and i think this is perfect! its pretty big to so thats nice to me... if you have seen the beverly hills couture kit by Anastasia its a bit bigger than that! I recommend it to people wanting to try it(: seems like a good price to me! Plus I ordered it on Thursday and received it that Saturday!</li>
    <li> It came on time and the powders were very smooth and soft. When I received mine it was broken and there was powder all over the package. These powders are light coverage in my opinion but are very nice.</li>
    <li> Kept it anyway, wheel that arrived broken didn&#x27;t think I would use anyway. Easy to apply and blends well but looks &amp;#34;cake-y&amp;#34; after a few hours.</li>
    <li> This is my second palette,  it blends well and the colors are perfect for blending and highlighting can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
    <li> Can I give a lower number? Not pigmented at all, sure it was $10 and even a beginner in Pro makeup I know that this stuff sucks. Big time. It&#x27;s a great package and looks like the real deal, but honestly I was thinking someone played a joke on me? It goes on like chalk. It&#x27;s really low quality...go ahead and get the Anastasia. I know you want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is currently in the trash by my vanity.</li>
    <li> This size is huge! Love it!</li>
    <li> It is just what I wanted.  A wide variety of colors for shading and highlighting.  Holds my make up in place nicely and blends together well.  If you are looking for a set of powders to shade with its hard to go wrong with this set.</li>
    <li> very cheaply made.. honestly would not waste your money.</li>
    <li> It was awful. When received every pallet was broken</li>
    <li> Pros: good for the price, efficient timing, usable, comes in a good variety of colors and as shown, easy to apply and does stay on well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Packaging was messy, one of my colors was in pieces completely (lucky, probably not a color I was planning to use) and that pieced color got mixed with the others at least a little bit. However, still usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/5 stars because of these reasons.</li>
    <li> Palette arrived with 3 of the colors broken and powder all over EVERYTHING. It was a huge mess. Very disappointed because I was really looking forward to using it.</li>
    <li> The palette of colors was exactly the same of the pictures they have here, the colors are good when you blend. For the price is a very good deal, this palette is for new people at contouring very good colors to start doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually love it, the colors look so natural on the skin and the finish look is really good.</li>
    <li> Has a very nice consistency.  It is a powder, which I am very pleased about, but there also a creamyness to it which makes it go on very smooth and opaque. I would definately recommend this to ANYONE who is interested in contouring</li>
    <li> Great item reasonably price, came fast.</li>
    <li> When the kit arrived, it was all broken up.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a big palette! I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so large.</li>
    <li> This is from CHINA! It smells of chemicals and the colors are different than the PHOTO. Do. Not. Buy. This.</li>
    <li> The colors are great, if I got the right ones. The middle shade on the top is yellow and the blush is orange.</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened the packaged, powered was everywhere. I one of the colors was broken and it was a powder mess. I should&#x27;ve listened to other reviewers</li>
    <li> I like this makeup however I am very pale skinned so I only use these contour during the night time and I think it will be ok during the summer day or night when I have a little bit of a tan. It is very easy to apply and there are lots of how to videos on Youtube.</li>
    <li> It has no name brand , no name? No brand? No exp date ? You don&#x27;t see anything on it at all. Not even where it was manufactured ..&lt;br /&gt;I would never buy this ever</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great deal for what it is, and way bigger than I had expected! I guess I pictured a 3x5in deal, but it&#x27;s actually like 5x8! I use it everyday on my neck, and sometimes my nose. I use a sephora contour pallet on my cheeks and forehead. All in all this is a good product.</li>
    <li> I really do love this contour palette. Definitely met my expectations</li>
    <li> Good for very subtle contouring.  Amount of product is good for the price.  Would be 5 stars if the product was more pigmented when applied.</li>
    <li> This thing is huge! I did not expect it to be so big. Mine was not broken when it arrived. I am learning to contour and not by any means an expert.</li>
    <li> I really like this contouring kit, I use it every single day. I would say the color directly under the white is more yellow than the picture shows. It comes on very easily, I&#x27;m very pale skinned and I use the top far right for the cheek contouring. I put the bottom middle color on the cheek bones and around my hair line, looks very nice like I am sun kissed. The white color is a bit powdering, I do not use it that often.</li>
    <li> Great palette!  It goes on smooth and is easy to blend.</li>
    <li> Good product. I wish it were a cream instead of powder though. I&#x27;ve never bought a contouring kit. But I like it b/c the colors aren&#x27;t too dark. It definatly works for fair skin. But idk if I like it yet. I mean it is possible in using the product wrong. I would definatly suggest using a cream instead of powder. I would think it would be easier to blend and manipulate.</li>
    <li> Product is good for the price. The colors are great but they tend to not hold for more than 5/6 hours. Also, powders were very cracked when I received them.</li>
    <li> This is a great palette for highlighting and contouring on fair skin. If your a woman of color with dark brown tones this isn&#x27;t the palette for you. For medium skin tones and lighter its fantastic! It arrived 2 weeks earlier than it was supposed to. I love it.</li>
    <li> Nice pigmentation, but be sure not to over do it. Add on a little at a time.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it not what inspected ...</li>
    <li> Great item, bigger than I thought it would be but great color and overall value of product</li>
    <li> Very good set and perfect for beginners. The colors are surprisingly not too dark, which is perfect</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s start with the good... This palette is huge! It will surely last even a makeup artist more than a few months. However, the colors aren&#x27;t too pigmented (except for the darkest brown), so don&#x27;t expect to have to use it as sparingly as Anastasia&#x27;s palette. One big issue that popped out for me was that the middle color on the bottom row isn&#x27;t a warm beige color as may be seen on the computer screen... It&#x27;s actually a deep peach blush. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a pretty blush and works well with the rest of the palette, but it&#x27;s just not what I expected to get. Also, the white color is actually just white. Unless you&#x27;re a ghost, I&#x27;m not sure how you would use it on your face. I use it mostly for eyeshadow purposes since I don&#x27;t want to waste it. I think it&#x27;s honestly good if you do a lot of theatre or stage makeup, since it&#x27;s big enough for a few people to use and it&#x27;s cheap but effective. It&#x27;s a good palette to use to get a hang of contouring before you move up to using more expensive products, but I&#x27;m not sure I would ever repurchase it upon its completion.</li>
    <li> Just what we wanted and arrived on time</li>
    <li> This thing is fantastic! It shipped quickly and was totally undamaged (something I was really concerned about. I&#x27;m still learning how to properly contour but this is a great learners starter kit with a good selection of shades to play around with. Excellent product, would order again.</li>
    <li> Great pallet for my skin type. Im light skin colored and its a great add to my makeup collection.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I just received today my contour palette and it was broken. Hopefully the seller can replace it. I like the colors and I had read reviews from people that have had the same issue. I guess I was hoping for the best.</li>
    <li> The color pick up well it just is really hard to blend. You really have to sit there and blend all over.</li>
    <li> Lots of product!  Bigger than expected. The colors are pretty but not perfect for my skin tone. Next time, I will purchase a cream contour pallette.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s bigger than it looks in the picture. Worth the price</li>
    <li> It was broken  when it arrived  and the colors don&#x27;t transfer  from brush  to skin well. Bummers</li>
    <li> This was just what I was looking for for contouring and highlighting. I&#x27;m new to it and these were easy to use.</li>
    <li> Mine arrived safely! Awesome size, seriously way bigger than I imagined it would be. The colors are nice, the only thing is the middle bottom color is like a peach color. That&#x27;s the only reason I gave it a 4. It was packaged nicely, and with so much bubble wrap. So no worries on that!</li>
    <li> Did not come with instruction guide or anything but the product itself. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Great set for makeup contouring!</li>
    <li> nice make up , i love it.very good price! will come back again, my friend want to buy it also</li>
    <li> i was expecting this product , but when it arrived the white was all broken , but the rest were just fine .</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this palette! Perfect for lighter skintones. I reach for it over more expensive ones, it&#x27;s beautiful. Has a perfect cool toned color for contouring. And two very pale setting powders. Blush is lovely too and I almost always use it when I have the palette out</li>
    <li> something about the colors seem chalky....makes for a dark ashy look. pigment seems good. too forever to arrive but at least it was all intact</li>
    <li> I have Latin skin, medium to dark brown, and this palette is perfect for contouring. It&#x27;s light weight and although it isn&#x27;t super pigmented, it works well.</li>
    <li> This was my first foray into contouring,  and this pallette was perfect!! I love it, bought 3 more as gifts!!&lt;br /&gt;Be sure and get the makeup brushes to help complete your look. I got the Kabuki makeup brushes. Love them too!!!!!</li>
    <li> This review from my daughter who loves this product.</li>
    <li> Love the options you have for contouring!  Its light but packs a lot of color.  Must have for contouring.  I do wedding make up and don&#x27;t know how I made it this far without it.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Very complete color palette. Great  for contouring and highlighting. I love that I don&#x27;t have to buy other sets of makeup,  and I can mix and match for my skin color, specially during winter or summer when my skin changes due to sun exposure. Fast delivery too!</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product I almost received it instantly. I have had this for over a year now and do not use it everyday but use it pretty frequently. I am surprised on how long this has lasted me! I love the range of colors it comes with. When contouring/highlighting I usually use the two darkest colors on the right and the two lightest colors on the left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was great with zero &amp;#34;broken&amp;#34; colors. The amount that this comes with is huge! Each circle is at least an inch and a half wide. I would definitely buy this product again and recommend it to any friend that is interested in buying a cheap nice quality contour powder. It has a nice matte finish and the powder colors stand out enough to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/8/16:&lt;br /&gt;It has been over two years since I have bought this and I use it about once a week, I still have plenty of powder left! This contouring powder will last you forever! I will definitely buy more when it&#x27;s out, but I am surprised on how long its lasting. Great quality powder for such a cheap price. I highly recommend buying this!</li>
    <li> would buy again, came in great condition.</li>
    <li> The powder is nice i prefer creme. Great for the price does countour the face nicely. the white doesnt work so good. i stick to brown and beige and pink they work great!</li>
    <li> This pallet sucks when it came in it was a eyeshadow it wasn&#x27;t liquid and when I put it on the brown one it made me look so badeven the light blended it don&#x27;t blend it looks really bad it looks like a dollar store pallet but I think I could&#x27;ve get a better one at dollar store so don&#x27;t waste your money it sucks 👎👎👎😠</li>
    <li> beautiful coverage. matte finish. silky on the skin. would buy again, and have already recommended to friends.</li>
    <li> I went back and forth on whether this was worth buying but I am so happy that I did. I just couldn&#x27;t pay $40 for a contour kit so finding one at this quality for $10 is amazing. It&#x27;s a lot bigger than I expected. The pigmentation is wonderful, much better than I expected. The powder is a creamy consistency, not chalky. The colors are spot on for a fair complection. If your darker complected it may not work as well for you, otherwise absolutely buy it.     I was also concerned about how many broken pallets were received, but mine came in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to receiving this product. Too bad it arrived with several colors broken.</li>
    <li> best make up for couture..:-)</li>
    <li> This contained a lot more make up than I was expecting, each circle was almost as big as the individual powder foundation sets you normally get at the drugstore.  Like others have said, the product is low pigment, so you don&#x27;t really see the color on your skin.  I wasn&#x27;t exactly expecting powder foundation, but it was really surprising that it doesn&#x27;t show up at all.  I have average to dry skin, so when I used it to set my liquid foundation, it caused my make up to crack.  I&#x27;ll try again in summer when my skin has more moisture.  It is good for contouring when you want a very subtle effect.  Overall, a product that does what the description says, and so cheap!</li>
    <li> I have very pale skin and a lot of freckles, so contour is hard to find without making me look orange or just like i have dirt on my face, i like these because i can blend the two browns together to get the color i want for my face and it works out very nicely, easy to apply and it came in one piece wasn&#x27;t broken or anything, i use the peachy tones to cover up any blemishes i might have, so it kind of works for everything. i haven&#x27;t broken out or anything using it so that&#x27;s a plus for me. i didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because i like it, i&#x27;m never really in love with any make up lol.</li>
    <li> This product was mostly broken and unusable. It also did not fit my skin tone at all, but I am practicing contouring and it still holds up to it&#x27;s purpose...what little usable product I had left.</li>
    <li> Smooth, fine powder. I am very pleased! Will definitely purchase again..when the time comes. Plus the case is true to size.</li>
    <li> In love with this pallet. colors are great for medum/light skin tone.lasts for a long time! the powder is very light on my skin even in hot Arizona summers!</li>
    <li> Very powdery, wish they would have been more pigmented at least/:</li>
    <li> I like this product because it has a variety of shades and colors. However, the picture looks as if the product is cool tones, and the tones are warm tones.. It&#x27;s on I guess, but cool tones look better on my skin, and I though that is what I ordered according to the picture.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great!! Much bigger than I had expected and has great colors.. I was a bit afraid that it would come in shattered in pieces as other reviewers have claimed.. But it was the total opposite:)</li>
    <li> Love the product. The case that it is in was just a little damaged but all in all  great buy</li>
    <li> Very good colors loved this product its smooth on my skin im not pale im like descent but this makes u look tan if you use the bottom right color the deep brown I mix the light brown with the dark brown to give a nice look but yes makes you look tanner than usual more if you contour . I haven&#x27;t found a better product then this . Yes cane cracked that&#x27;s because my ups man wasn&#x27;t careful with it luckly I don&#x27;t use the darker pink shade it fell right out even though it was cracked it just fell but hey thats okay!! Still good I would recommend you to buy this if you are just starting contouring and or like me just like the powder nit the cream 💜💆</li>
    <li> These colors definitely work! They make it so easy to blend, and illusionally reshape your face into an oval one!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic palette for the fair maiden&#x27;s makeup collection (But works with medium skin tones as well)! The powders have nice coverage and are build able. You can take the highlighting and contouring from day to night with the options of shades. The more you work with it, the more you love it! Five stars for sure!</li>
    <li> Would give this product a zero if possible. I received a blush pallette instead of this contour pallette with hideous colors and the blushes were cracked. Horrible care for the package.</li>
    <li> Bought one, received it broked. They sent me a new one as soon as I contacted them. I absolutely love this pallet. It&#x27;s very pigmented and I never want it to run out.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing palette for highlighting and contouring. These colors work great for people with a lighter skin tone. I&#x27;ve compared this palette to a similar one that cost a lot more money, and I saw no difference. This inexpensive palette works just as well as the ones people pay a lot of money for. I&#x27;m a makeup artist, and use lots of different makeups and brands, and I can honestly say that this is a great buy! Most times the cheaper makeup can work just as well or better than the expensive ones. I highly recommend this palette! I have the blush and eyeshadow from this company as well, and they work great too! Definitely worth the 5 stars I gave it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much bigger than I thought it&#x27;d be! Definitely worth the money I spent.</li>
    <li> Cheap makeup! Do not waste your time and money.</li>
    <li> I advise anyone thinking of getting this item to just spend a little more money and get the real deal. This goes on like a translucent powder not like a blush or anything to contour like in the description. Total waste on money!!</li>
    <li> I love it! I was not expecting such a large quality product,</li>
    <li> Product delivered fast, great amount of it. It just didnt mix together on my skin very well. I have olive tone skin so the dark color pigmented my skin and wouldn&#x27;t mix, just stained my skin. The white made my skin look chalky under my eyes. Will keep to use for the nuetral colors and blush.</li>
    <li> This product is great for doing contours!!!</li>
    <li> Pretty decent. the powders are easy to use for a beginning contourer like myself. the white highlighting part doesnt show up that well.</li>
    <li> The product has a ton of fallout. The colors are more suited for darker skin tones. The packaging is actually huge and bulky in real life. There is no mirror. FOR THE PRICE - I will say that the quality is good, and it is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> It had a little too much fragrance but it is okay.</li>
    <li> I like it! It is a lot bigger than what it looks like in the picture, for a good price. It is a little powdery, but it still is a good product.</li>
    <li> I love this palette, I am knew to contouring and highlighting but I found this easy to use. I just love it!</li>
    <li> Reminded me of children&#x27;s play make up.  Not for grown ups. Very low quality. I was very disappointed to say the least. Color pigment was not saturated.</li>
    <li> This is great and stays in place along with easy to blend in shading contours of the face for slimming the jowl line</li>
    <li> This product is great, perfect for achieving a contoured look!! I would recommend this product to any woman professional or amateur.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, just as described. I prefer this palette over my expensive ones. Its better than my lancome products. Truly!</li>
    <li> Love this! I just need to master how to blend it. Great for the price.</li>
    <li> better than I expected to be, and it is actually larger than picture shown. But it is really strange that the product is shipped from China while it wrote USA...</li>
    <li> Large amount of product and did not arrive broken like others claimed. Product blend beautifully and is perfect for starters who are learning without an obnoxious price tag!</li>
    <li> Has a cheap makeup smell, but works pretty well, I use the darker for contouring and the lighter to set under eye concealed they are quite powdery but for the price, their good.</li>
    <li> I have had great complements with this product. It looks natural, flawless, and your skin looks amazing the whole day.</li>
    <li> The medium and deeper colors are a bit too much on the orange side.  The lighter ones are a little hard to see on the skin.  Overall, the colors aren&#x27;t very pigmented.  Works for what I need it for, though.</li>
    <li> Shipped very fast. The product was a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be.</li>
    <li> This is a powder makeup&lt;br /&gt;Easily applied and taken off&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable to wear- no irritation&lt;br /&gt;Great for contouring</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT pallette! I love it. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t use a couple of the colors that come in it. Other than that, it is fantastic. I&#x27;ve had it about 7 months while using it nearly every day and it&#x27;s only now starting to get low enough that I might need to re-order.</li>
    <li> I received this product damaged, but honestly I was expecting at least one of the powders to be broken up so that wasn&#x27;t a big surprise. The makeup itself is cheap and talcy but thats what I expected for the price. Doesn&#x27;t blend very well. When I was done applying it it looked like I rubbed a bunch of dirt on my face.</li>
    <li> Perfect for contouring my face! The colors are true.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also way bigger than you&#x27;d expect!&lt;br /&gt;Wil be ordering this set as often as needed! (:</li>
    <li> Am a makeup junkie can&#x27;t get enough of the stuff that being said I have been making changes to find good products at a even better coast I was kinda iffy about this but I took a gable ,I was super happy with the size first off palette is huge! First bush stroke hardly picked up but once u get the press finish off it works pretty well needless say 3 of my friends have now got it every body be looking like Kim K haha</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be that good for the price, but I was pleasantly surprised, it might not be as good as the expensive brands, but definitely up there with common store bands and the not as expensive well known brands.</li>
    <li> This is a nice palette but the pinks don&#x27;t really show up. I&#x27;m new to contouring and this is a great starter. I wish it had a mirror though.</li>
    <li> i am new to the makeup and contouring world but this has made it very easy to accomplish the look i want, i get many compliments on my makeup and it blends very easily</li>
    <li> It works great for contouring really worth the money I spent. I didn&#x27;t need to splurge to get a good quality product.</li>
    <li> The product is quality, but the color is not what is shown in the picture. The dark shades are about 10 shades lighter than what is shown in the pictures. Had I known that the colors were so far off, I would have never purchased that pallet.</li>
    <li> I read through a lot of these posts before purchasing. Decided to buy it.. Received the package a few days ago and decided to give it a try. I have to say I am &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; to the contouring world and used to working with cremes. I was not impressed with this palette. Yes, the price is wonderful (compared to high end kits that I&#x27;ve been dying for) but if the product isn&#x27;t up to par are you really &amp;#34;saving&amp;#34;? It doesn&#x27;t have much pigment really. I am FAIR, and this needs to be darker. There is no way a person with even medium toned skin would be happy with this. It does seems chalky, everyone wants a buttery soft foundation. I would say skip this.</li>
    <li> The colors are great for those with any skin color. Though it is a bit thick sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;Upon delivery the product was broken on the darker sides..</li>
    <li> I know this Frola kit is advertised as a contouring kit, and it works well for that purpose. But while I was waiting for my Urban Decay Naked Basics shadows to arrive, I thought I might try something a little cheaper to serve the same purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The UD Naked Basics is the smallest of the UD Naked line: the thing that makes it so popular is that all but one of the shadows are MATTE. When you&#x27;re not in your 30s anymore, it&#x27;s time to put away the glittery eye stuff...but even more than that, matte eye colors aren&#x27;t meant to be &#x27;color&#x27;, per se. They&#x27;re used to give a natural and improved look to the eye - the beiges, pinky-browns, and taupes work great with brown eyes (and can be a fantastic contrast to blue.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you&#x27;re essentially doing to the eye is the same thing that the Frola palette was created to do with the face: light highlights, dark recedes. Using this as an eyeshadow base worked well; the colors are eminently buildable for a more dramatic yet natural look. (And did I mention they&#x27;re matte?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work well, too, for face contouring, esp. for someone who is fair as I am. But for me, they&#x27;re the biggest eyeshadow pans I&#x27;ve ever had, and they work great to create a nude contour look for my brown eyes. If you don&#x27;t like it for contouring, recycle it for a naked eye look. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money.  Powder is very drying and does absolutely nothing to contour the face.  You can not even tell if you used light or dark.  Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Like everyone said, this is a very large palette.  Each one is full size.  The pigment is really light for the most of it.  The yellow one is not very brighting(not a banana powder).  I think it&#x27;s good overall and sometimes I do like to have a palette that is lighter in pigment.  Love the contour colors.  It&#x27;s good to have in your collection.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to such a big sized palette. Sometimes less is more. I really wished this was more of a compact size, at least small enough to fit in my makeup bag for traveling purposes, but this palette is just too big. I guess I should of read the measurements.</li>
    <li> the product is so chalky that it makes it look like you dumped your face in dirt. BUT if you know how to properly put on makeup amd take your time with it, you can plend it evenly and make it look great1</li>
    <li> Great colors but one of them came broken. Also it&#x27;s a little hard to blend but over all great for the price you pay. And definitely bigger then I thought.</li>
    <li> When the package arrived, all of the makeup was crumbled and unusable. I had no choice but to return it.</li>
    <li> For some reason I thought this was a cream palate but it&#x27;s a powder. That maybe my fault tho.&lt;br /&gt; Over all it has a good choice of colors that can work for everyone.  Feels a little light in that it seems to come off fairly quickly w the slightest trace of sweat.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a Great product for the price not as pigmented as the Anastasia pallet but it&#x27;s great for travel and things</li>
    <li> It came to me all cracked and ruined. Its nice when it works, but it makes a huge mess, dust and powder is everywhere</li>
    <li> Product came completely broken. I was unable to use it and instead of replacing it my only option was a refund.</li>
    <li> This is a simple to use and easy to carry kit. Works perfect for highlighting and contouring and blending. Shipping was quick and product is good quality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright.  The colors are a bit strange.</li>
    <li> I love that the kit is so compact.  It fits perfectly in my mini makeup bag.</li>
    <li> I love that they are large enough to last a long time. I alternate between the 2 lightest shades to highlight and they last all day. I use a different bronzer as my prime and use the darker shades to blend it all together. LOVE. and its lasting me a long time!</li>
    <li> Amazing product, easy storage and transportable. Great for those quick makeup needs.  Need to keep away from my teenager! She&#x27;s a product taker!!  LOL!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this palette! I have light-to-medium skin and purchased this so I could experiment with contouring. It&#x27;s amazing, especially for this price!  The colors are light enough to layer as needed but not too light. The powder is not cakey or heavy. The palette was also larger than I expected it to be. It&#x27;s going to last for a long time. Hopefully this is still selling by the time I need another one! I highly recommend it :)</li>
    <li> I went to Ulta and bought  $60 for conture make up. This product is just as good. And has all that you need put together.</li>
    <li> This was awful, the pallet arrived completely broken and nearly unusable. I wish I followed other reviews about the product since I have read other customers received their product broken as well.</li>
    <li> Mine came within five days in perfect condition. It is a full sized powder pallete and I love it! -Leslie</li>
    <li> the pigmentation is spot on and just as expected</li>
    <li> the color pay off on the darker colors is perfect for contouring and it blends easily. However, the highlight colors have little color pay off and I didn&#x27;t see it working very well for setting foundations. Still, for the extremely low cost of this it is completely worth it and I recommend it! I just use my basic concealer to use as a highlighter and use the darker colors from this pallet to contour. I found the consistency of the powder nice and it didn&#x27;t have any negative side effects on my skin (IE:breaking out)  Honestly can&#x27;t  beat the price for this, great beginners starter contour pallet.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!! Goes on smooth and I no longer have to use my liquid foundation again!!</li>
    <li> Just recieved this today and I immediately tried it out. Its fantastic I am fair skined with pink under tones this hid them all. All u need it a yellow powder and you are set...</li>
    <li> As good as any of the other expensive ones out there, why pay more, it does the trick!!</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how great this palette is!! Almost spent 60$-- and this does it all. Contours. Coverage. There is no contour chart, but it is super easy to find these on Internet. You will love this!</li>
    <li> Great little contouring and highlighting palette. Bought this as a cheap alternative to something else that I wanted but it was out of stock so I settled for this. Turned out to be a nice little palette. Nothing fancy just your basic contouring. Exactly as pictured.</li>
    <li> This a surprisingly large palette and it is definitely packaged beautifully. That being said, I was not too impressed after using it. The colors are okay; not too pigmented, but still show. I am pretty fair and I found even the brightest highlight to be lacking in my opinion. The powder was very very loose. It does not blend well. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again, but I will continue to use it for a bit.</li>
    <li> Received with broken pressed powder. Powder EVERYWHERE and a day late. Would never order this (what looks like a great product) from this provider again. Paid for useless makeup. I&#x27;m Very very disappointed that I can&#x27;t load this picture of the product right out of the box.</li>
    <li> Came late, but there is a ton of product. Not very pigmented, but just enough for my pale skin. Colors are true to picture. But the product smell smells like plastic. It&#x27;s kind of nasty, but a good product otherwise. It is very smooth and easy to blend.</li>
    <li> Such a great product for the price! Provides light, natural contouring that IS NOT orange like so many can be. I also like that these are powders and not heavy creams.</li>
    <li> I was on the hunt for affordable contour pallets.  This was is just ok.  It isn&#x27;t super pigmented and isn&#x27;t the easiest to blend out.  The contour shades are a little on the warm side as well which isn&#x27;t always ideal for contouring.  The highlight shades were nice and worked for setting my under eye concealer.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how the powder would look, but if you use concealer or light BB crème it goes on smooth. I have had it for mos and still going strong. I use it daily sometimes twice a day.</li>
    <li> very easy to use and high lights your face really nice.  just LOVE IT. Im a beginner and this works for me</li>
    <li> I use this almost every day. The powder makes my face look lighter and not like I could take my makeup off with a spoon.</li>
    <li> Use this in my professional kit and it is perfect. I don&#x27;t have to have a million contouring powders, and they are not SO pigmented that I have to worry about streaking or blotchiness. The lighter shades work great for bringing subtle highlight as they are matte, and also set the under eye really well for a highlighted look without being too intense. This is PERFECT for bridal makeup!! I use it occasionally on myself as well, it works for a variety of skin tones. Have nothing but positive things to say!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup often, but the few times I used the product, it seemed to work just fine. More than likely, I&#x27;m applying it incorrectly, but whatever.</li>
    <li> So this Contouring Kit is awesome I use it as a Base, Powder and to give final touches to make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came with instructions on how to properly apply them, But those you can get online.</li>
    <li> The time it took to get delivered was not fast and the actually lid of the container is plastic and flimsy to me. It would suit the company as well as the customers if the top to the pallet was a harder plastic. It would keep the powder better protected. But none the less the powder itself is great! Lasts all day especially with finishing/setting spray.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get a chance to sample this product since it arrived completely broken.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with the product its self but this is the second time I order the same exact product and the make up comes broken. I hate having to send this product back for the second time it is very inconvenient.</li>
    <li> its super cheap maybe for a kid but not for an adult</li>
    <li> LOVE this pallet. Will def. purchase again!!!</li>
    <li> I recieved my palette today &amp; it was supposed to be delivered on aug 6 !!! That is amazing . &amp; I thought the palette was cream , I just tried it &amp; I LOVEEEEEEEEED IT .</li>
    <li> I was a little unsure because of the low price... But this pallete does wonders!!!</li>
    <li> love the product and i got it before the expected date</li>
    <li> I am happy with the colors and it is a large palette but mine was broken and it was a mess before i even opened it :-(</li>
    <li> the palette are so great and big but when i open it arrived broken although they were very kind and make me a instand refund. thank you.</li>
    <li> I have very pale skin and use the darkest colour to contour. It does not show up well and I have to use a lot to get the correct amount. The lighter colours work fantastic for highlighting or adding a pinky glow.</li>
    <li> It was broken and makeup was everywhere! Bummed me out because I was so excited to receive it.</li>
    <li> So I ordered this and it came fast (thanks to amazon prime) the colors are super pigmented and alot easier to blend then the coastal scents palette.  These colors don&#x27;t have a muddy look on my face like other palettes do :(  I would definitely buy it again :)</li>
    <li> Colors are lighter in person and not dark skin friendly.</li>
    <li> I receive my pallet in 10 days i thought i would recieve it broken but i didnt !!!!! Its BIG only thing&lt;br /&gt;Brown color is alil light</li>
    <li> No! when i open it, thw make up pouder broke into pieces and it was a mess!! dislike it alot!</li>
    <li> I really like my contour professional Outop cosmetics</li>
    <li> ITS ACTUALLY MASSIVE like no kidding lol its like the size of the tablet...lol NOT that im complaining or anything but just so you know. Its a bit powdery and like baby powder but not too bad.</li>
    <li> Product was missing one of the colors. Not worth returning it though. It was one we wouldn&#x27;t have used anyway but I&#x27;m not sure how it slips by people that are packaging it</li>
    <li> Sad that it came with one section broken ... I am sure they would replace, but not a returner.</li>
    <li> These are nice colors, I&#x27;m fair skinned and even the darkest shade can be blended to not look to drastic. They don&#x27;t cake up underneath makeup, and smooth texture not &amp;#34;crumbly&amp;#34; or loose. Good color payoff as well. Packaging came well wrapped, no damage in shipment.</li>
    <li> Loved the product. But the middle tan powder came crumbled in the bottom :/</li>
    <li> They are easy to apply and of good quality</li>
    <li> If I could give -1 I would.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even receive the correct colors, my pallet was hot pink, oranges and reds. Awful.</li>
    <li> Not what I ordered, i ordered a contour pallette got a blush palette.</li>
    <li> Great pallet! Thank you</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the image fool you, these pigments are large in size- each circle is 2.5&amp;#34; in diameter!&lt;br /&gt;The pigmentation is good too- it doesn&#x27;t take that much to get color on your face.&lt;br /&gt;However, these shades are best suited for people of fair to light skin- maybe for medium(?) skintone, although it would make a more subtle effect.&lt;br /&gt;The highlighters are nice and vary in range for different skin types. So share with your friends!</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin and can never find anything to help me contour my face.  This product is great because you can mix the colors and create the perfect shade to suit your skin tone.  I am already buying my second palette because I love this so much.  I highly recommend this palette.</li>
    <li> For the people saying this isn&#x27;t pigmented, I&#x27;m not really sure what palette you received  because the one I got is PERFECTLY pigmented. It gives enough color to give a natural shadow on your face, but is still layer-able to achieve subtle to more dramatic looks. The white is a beautiful matte that I apply with a contoured blush brush and gives just the right amount sheerness so you have a nice glowy look, and I mix the two darkest colors to shade my cheekbones, sides of my nose, and corners of my forehead (sometimes my jaw line if I want to look extra dramatic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this palette on several different people who all have different skin tones, one medium-warm, one with medium-olive, myself with fair-neutral,  and another with fair-cool. It has worked beautifully on everyone and does exactly what its supposed to when used correctly and with the right brushes.</li>
    <li> Never again.  Waste of money, pallet was completely broken.  What a freaking mess to clean.</li>
    <li> The make up isn&#x27;t high quality. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I love all the contouring colors you can mix and match to fit any skin tone. I&#x27;ve tried some expensive high end brand contouring powders. Lemme tell you just not as good as this one. It blends super well and the white powder you cannot find hardly anywhere!!! Love love love! Super worth it gals!</li>
    <li> Love it really nice sizes</li>
    <li> Horrible! Don&#x27;t buy. It&#x27;s super chalky &amp; smells horrible.</li>
    <li> Horrible !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Regret purchasing this pallet.  So ugly and cheap. You get for what you pay for basically.  It smells horrible and the pigmentation is horrible aswell. Everything is horrible about this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for highlighting and contouring, and when I used it for the first time I was disappointed. The shades for highlighting are great and easy to use, however the contouring shades are too dark and not natural looking. I have a light olive skin tone and I will not be using this to contour.</li>
    <li> awesome...i LOVE IT... ITS GREAT AND THE PRICE ITS BETTER</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my sister. My package did not come broken, but I kind of wish the palette also included a mirror.</li>
    <li> I thought this was cream contour and it&#x27;s powder.</li>
    <li> Not the best, but not the worst. It&#x27;s quite good for the price and it&#x27;s nicely pigmented. However, it does not blend very well on my skin and the individual colors break really easy. I&#x27;ve only had it for a few months and have been very careful with it, as i am all of my makeup. I&#x27;ve had every color but 2 break and become completely unusable. I would recommend it if you&#x27;re trying to save money. Next time i buy i contour kit though, i&#x27;ll definitely fork out the extra cash and buy a higher end palette.</li>
    <li> One of the palette color was broken, the colors are amazing and i love it</li>
    <li> Well worth the wait, what you see is what you get! Give it a try!</li>
    <li> The product is great, that&#x27;s why it got a star at least one star. So, bottom line is I got this product in great timing I was planning on having it for a party which is why I can&#x27;t return it. But one of my tiers broke and exploded all over my box, it mixed with my other colors and now I have to clear them off. I wish I could return this. I&#x27;m very upset and I wish I could just get a new one. I feel like I wasted money and I just have to settle because I really needed this product</li>
    <li> Just horrible. Wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
    <li> Love this! Great for contouring.</li>
    <li> I really like this makeup set. It was a lot larger than I expected. Every time I&#x27;ve worn it, I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my makeup. :)</li>
    <li> I am using it everyday!!  Why?  Because i am always getting compliments!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving this item 4 stars because they weren&#x27;t what I wanted, I wanted the concealer but instead I got powder. The powder actually works great though, I&#x27;ve done many clients with this palette, it&#x27;s long lasting for sure. My only issue is that if you don&#x27;t moisturize, it will look horrible so invest in a moisturizer for sure. Besides that, amazing product that I Weill keep using !!</li>
    <li> SHIPPED WAYYY FASTER THAN I ANTICIPATED. I RECIEVED IT WITHIN A WEEK, INSTEAD OF THE 1.5 MONTHS THAT WAS LISTED AS THE EXPECTED DELIVERY DATE. THE PRODUCT IS A NICE CREAMY BLENDABLE POWDER WITH GOOD COVERAGE AND GREAT STAYING POWER. IVE NEVER USED THE ANASTASIA CONTOUR PALETTE, BUT FOR THE PRICE, THIS PALETTE IS THE BOMB.&lt;br /&gt;THE CONTAINER IS PLASTIC AND FEELS A LITTLE CHEAP, OTHERWISE 5 STARS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I CANT TURN MY CAPS LOCK OFF.</li>
    <li> Worked very well when used with a contour brush. The pigments are stronger with a primer</li>
    <li> This product was broken into pieces and all the powders were smoothed and all over the box</li>
    <li> Wayyyy bigger than expected. Looks like a tablet lol.</li>
    <li> I received a completely different palette from what was shown.  The palette had 2 bright pink colors that look like blush.  The darkest contour shade is very light that I don&#x27;t think I can even use it to contour and I have light complexion.  Very disappointing.  Don&#x27;t think I will ever use this.  Good thing it was only 8 bucks.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The colors don&#x27;t match the pictures they r lighter so now I have to order one that is darker</li>
    <li> Although it said it would take a long time for delivery I had it within 2 weeks. I have been using it and I love it!</li>
    <li> I thought buying make up online would probably be a terrible experience, but because of the price I thought I&#x27;d just go for it. As it turns out the results were actually, really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am super pale and these are thin enough/ provide enough coverage to not look like a mask on my face and blend really nicely together.&lt;br /&gt;-I use the darkest one for contouring and then blend with the light brown.&lt;br /&gt;-There is a yellowish one I use under my eyes to counteract the bluish tones.&lt;br /&gt;- The pink is a lovely coral color that looks great with my warm skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;- I use the white to highlight. It isn&#x27;t shimmery which I like because I already look enough like a snow queen as it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product, wonderful price.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, get this.</li>
    <li> The delivery took like forever, but the package came perfect,  Love it!</li>
    <li> Good color pay off. I love the fact that this pallette has white in it!! I&#x27;m very pale so it&#x27;s perfect for me. Also the different tones for contouring work well. Just a little chalky is all that&#x27;s bad about it</li>
    <li> The white powder was cracked and made a huge mess! It got absolutely everywhere along with on the other powders. Plus, I now don&#x27;t have that color which was the one I was most looking forward to! I wish I never bought this item!</li>
    <li> Great my nice is that one who uses this produc</li>
    <li> It works well but smells DISGUSTING :( Which really stops me from using it at times</li>
    <li> Got it shipped from china. Took a while but got here within the estimated time. Pretty great box of makeup. They sell the same one at urban outfitters for twice the price! Good for all purpose use!</li>
    <li> Last i bought this it ended up being  Blush palette! Not cool!</li>
    <li> Returned this item as it was so poorly packaged that it was totally crumbled when I received it.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would be getting a creme or a powder, but I was pleased when it was a powder. It was also a lot bigger than I thought it would be, so that was really awesome. I&#x27;m looking forward to using it for my theater makeup and such</li>
    <li> Love it! When i purchase this i thought that it was cream, but dont care &#x27;cause is a nice pallette with the perfect tone</li>
    <li> This product is good for the fair skinned. It goes on light.&lt;br /&gt;When used alone it will set in your pores. When put over foundation it seems to last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price of Def order again.</li>
    <li> These have quite a high pigment for the price. It&#x27;s a good powder contouring kit for the price (for fair skin).</li>
    <li> Completely destroyed upon receiving it. Only sells one kind however what I received was in shades of bright pink. More like Barbie eyeshadow than a highlight &amp; contour kit. Shipped from China with no return address in English. Lucky for me 8$ isn&#x27;t much of a loss.</li>
    <li> I was so impressed by this wonderful highlight/contour pallet.  The size of this is super impressive. Professional quality, good pigmentation, easy to apply. I have seen similar pallets from the big names in the makeup business for 10 times (and even more) the cost. I highly recommend this for your makeup kit.</li>
    <li> IN LOVE WITH THIS PALLETTE.. DEF AN EVERYDAY USE. I WOULD PURSHASE THIS ITEM AGAIN 😄</li>
    <li> And I receive my package, two of the colors out of the pallet were damaged, cracked and falling apart,</li>
    <li> I ordered this without looking at dimensions I guess and it is HUGE. Seriously, each one of those circles is the size of a normal powder compact. It&#x27;s really fun to play with. In the winter it was a bit difficult for me to get the shading just right (because I am naturally very pale, about one shade up from porcelain). But now that I&#x27;m getting more sun I can use the darker colors to better effect. Definitely recommend. Probably works beat for medium skin tones.</li>
    <li> The product would be nice-- if it was usable. I ordered this twice and it arrived in pieces. Wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> This a matte powder that works perfectly for highlight/contour.</li>
    <li> I got in my pallete in the mail and it was broken and the powders were falling out</li>
    <li> Powder contour set was good</li>
    <li> For the price this is amazing!</li>
    <li> A little too shear but still worth the buy.</li>
    <li> I think the dark powder for contouring is a bit too chalky and dark for fair-toned skin. I blended and blended and it was always chalky. The lighter shades worked okay for setting highlighter or illuminator. The light pinkish shade worked well for a subtle hint of color on the cheeks. But, after having it for a few weeks, the lighter powders cracked apart because I dropped it on the counter. No other powder palette of mine has cracked apart because of me dropping it such a short distance. This kit just is not high quality, so I&#x27;m sticking to my better quality (and unfortunately more expensive) contouring bronzers and highlighters.</li>
    <li> great quality powder! so light and defined</li>
    <li> love this!! makes my face look perfectly contoured.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Im in  love😍</li>
    <li> I love the colors. They last a long time as well!</li>
    <li> I wish it was a bit creamier.</li>
    <li> I wish this palette was as neutral as the photo suggests, but the reality is that there is a yellow shade and a bright orange shade in there that I&#x27;m not entirely sure I can use, but I may be able to mix them with other stuff. I can definitely get use out of the white for highlighting and the brownish shades for contouring or simple eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend uses this everyday bought it as a gift for it I don&#x27;t know any better but it seems like she likes it</li>
    <li> loved this i still need to practice on contouring my face but it just blend in great, would buy again..</li>
    <li> Received mines and it was broken,very disappointed never buying again</li>
    <li> not much pigment. its worth spending more to get a higher quality.</li>
    <li> This thing is huge! I was expecting something smaller lol but I mean the bigger the better!  This will definitely last me a while.</li>
    <li> Came broke! So sad :(</li>
    <li> Completely in love!!!</li>
    <li> 1) Service/Shipment Review: this product arrived on time, in a mailing envelope with a layer of bubble wrap.  I was nervous opening this because some of the other reviews have complained their palettes came damaged, but my product came unscathed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Product review: I am a beginner in contouring and couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay $40 for the Anastasia contouring palette to &amp;#34;see if I liked contouring&amp;#34;.  I found this palette and for @$8 I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot!  Never heard of the brand Frola and was skeptical so I looked up their website and it looked legit so I pulled the trigger.  I was expecting the palette to not be very pigmented, but the pigmentation is actually really nice, the consistency is a bit powdery/chalky and it doesn&#x27;t seem blend well for me.  I have normal skin and am Asian, so I am medium with some yellow in my skin.  I have tried it both over powder and liquid foundation and the results look and feel the same. However, as I am a beginner, you could chalk it up to &amp;#34;user error&amp;#34;.  I would not buy it again, but for the price, it&#x27;s still a good buy and do not regret the purchase.</li>
    <li> Huge pans but not pigmented. Wouldnt use it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that great at all</li>
    <li> This is a great matte product for highlighting and contouring. I don&#x27;t like it to look severe, and these make it easy to do when you&#x27;re in a hurry. I apply it over my foundation and blend it, and I absolutely love the way it melts into my foundation.</li>
    <li> I just opened my package. Whatever it was, it was NOT makeup. Both the compact, the box it was in, and the bubble wrap AROUND the closed box was covered in a neon pink dust. Not quite sure what the dust was from, I opened the compact and realized that rather than the highlighting and contouring compact I was promised, I had received 6 neon pink circles, half of them already disintegrated into the above mentioned pink dust and was now all over my clothing, bedspread, and beige shag carpeting. Thanks, NOT!!!!</li>
    <li> I like it, but one of them were broke when i got it, thankfully it wasn&#x27;t a shade i would really use</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s great. I use mac cosmetics so comparing this to mac the pigments aren&#x27;t great. It&#x27;s a good starter set for contouring beginners.</li>
    <li> When I received this is was all broken :( sadly I didn&#x27;t get to try it as I had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> Worse thing I&#x27;ve ever bought. Came it late. The powder in there was complety broken into pieces.</li>
    <li> Beautifully matte, very large. It is a little light for darker skin tones. I have a medium skin tone and I usr the for a very subtle contour. I love it.</li>
    <li> very good .... Normal ...  :)</li>
    <li> Way bigger than I realized! But I love it though.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this as a gift for a great friend of mine and she said she loves it!</li>
    <li> Palette was in bad condition makeup fell apart, waste of my money</li>
    <li> This pallet is huge. I never expected it to be such a large pallet. The colors arent all the same as they are in the picture. All of the shades in the picture either look white, pink or tan. When I got mine most the colors were the same except the tan at the top right of the pallet is green and there are no pink colors. they are just white, a little bit darker white and then the dark color in the corner. The dark color still works pretty well though.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I want to buy more! Way bigger than I expected and great pigmentation! The colors are perfect for almost everyone!</li>
    <li> Even though it wasn&#x27;t the original,  it was a great selection.  It did the job and my make up lasted for hours.  I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This is a really big pallet and I think that&#x27;s great. However I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I already have light skin but I cannot get the highlighting colors to show up. Not even a little. I even tried applying it 3 times and still no highlight. The Contoring colors work great. I have no complaints with them. It&#x27;s hard to get the look I want if I can&#x27;t get the highlight shades to show up. I was pretty bummed. I think if you naturally have a dark skin tone that these will work a lot better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice since I&#x27;ve gotten it but so far I like it ok. I&#x27;m still learning how to use it. It seems like one of the darker colors I used for contouring was a little orange the first time, but maybe it was the way I mixed them together. I definitely like it to use as a way to learn how to highlight and contour but I would probably go with one a little more expensive next time!</li>
    <li> I was surprised of the size when it came it was a lot bigger then I expected. the colors are nice for fair skin, the powders go on very soft. the colors were different from the picture, different then what I expected. also 2 of them had fallen out &amp; the plastic case was broken.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with this pallet- great quality for the price, and it stays on all day!</li>
    <li> Can make it subtle or pronounced which makes it very versitile. All colors are matte, too, so that makes contouring easy. The pan sizes will last me forever.</li>
    <li> Awesome, works great and it&#x27;s HUGE!</li>
    <li> Makes my face look so much thinner when I use this right.</li>
    <li> Light but good coverage- I though it would be a lot smaller. It&#x27;s a great value for the full size of each color you get...</li>
    <li> Im.sure this product would be nice I&#x27;d I actually received it...</li>
    <li> Colors are not as pictured. Chalky texture and application that does NOT blend. Very irritating to my skin.</li>
    <li> They sent me the wrong product, I received a palette of blushes instead of foundation powders and the quality is pretty cheap</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very cheap, I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not worth the buy...its just a poweder that does NOT add definition.</li>
    <li> I was going to use this for contouring but the color doesn&#x27;t go on evenly and the darkest color just made it look like I was dirty and had dirt on my face.</li>
    <li> Excellente product!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started contouring and I am asian- of medium light skin (in the winter) and darker olive colour in the summer. Right now, I think these colors are great for my skin tone. I also bought a more expensive, Smashbox, three color, palette. The Frola is pretty comparable t the Smashbox and gives you three other colors which helps picking tones for your skin type easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this one really has the white, highlighting color. My only complaint, and it&#x27;s really not a complaint, is that it&#x27;s huge. Much bigger than expected. I won&#x27;t be lugging it around in my purse but it&#x27;s nice because you get a lot of makeup for the price. Right now, I tend to blend my colors with the Smashbox pallette. I would recommend using a primer or lotion if you have drier skin. It also makes the colors pop more.</li>
    <li> When I opened my package, there was freaking pink powder everywhere. The color wasn&#x27;t even correct. This was the worst pallet I have ever got in my life. I regret it a lot. Don&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> This is the best pallete I have ever owned. The colors are just right for highlighting and contouring and there&#x27;s even a color in there that looks good as a blush :) Well worth the money</li>
    <li> I was unhappy with how my powder came, unsure if it was the companies fault or the way it was packaged. My powder is all shattered and when I opened it up pretty much all the powder is not on my kitchen floor. Very unhappy.</li>
    <li> I just received this product about a week and a half ago, and I love it! I think the white powder that it shows is translucent, but other than that every color matches the picture perfectly. These colors blend easily and I haven&#x27;t noticed any fading throughout the day. I got it a lot earlier than the expected delivery date also, which is a huge plus. I definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a good contour kit!</li>
    <li> Just like description and arrived before expected</li>
    <li> I ordered the kit with white and skin colors and got a kit with all pink colors that were broken!</li>
    <li> these are wonderful great coverage and super creamy</li>
    <li> It came on time without a blemish. I am very satisfied 👌</li>
    <li> Love all the colors! Thanks again</li>
    <li> Received the package late and the entire box was broken.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday I am so in love great price for a great product</li>
    <li> It came In the mail today and when I opened the package it was all crumbled and broken. Not worth my time trying to save. I guess that&#x27;s what I get for buying cheap makeup.</li>
    <li> This product arrive all broken. I am so disappointed will not be ordering again.</li>
    <li> it is not as seen in the picture and it is very flaxy and powdery ,it also makes my skin shine alot and i have oily to combination skin,it is not good also for contouring ,but can be used if you want just a powder face powder based.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t receive the right product as shown online...colors were different.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t use this much, too chalky</li>
    <li> For the price this product is great! Last all day and very natural.</li>
    <li> The palette was broken when I received it TWO months late. It also came in a different color then pictured. :(</li>
    <li> Much larger than expected</li>
    <li> Not worthwhile. The pigmentation is a 2 out of 10, 10 being the best. Extremely powdery, made a huge mess. The lighter shades are for highlighting but they&#x27;re basically translucent. They didn&#x27;t show of on my face at all, or on the back of my hand. It was a waste of money and I threw mine away.</li>
    <li> Works wonders! Great buy! I Told all my friends about it. I am so happy with the purchase I made.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this I thought it was are regular size compact, but it is super sized. I use this every day, and will order again.</li>
    <li> My palette came with completely different colors - pinks and oranges. Definitely not what the picture shows</li>
    <li> Bigger then I thought it would be love the bright colors</li>
    <li> It got here really fast! I love this stuff, I use it daily and plan on getting it regularly !! And its a large palette. Definitely recommended</li>
    <li> A lot of delivery problems,!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this powder! Love how there is light and dark colors for fall and summer.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product but I&#x27;d like it more if I had received it</li>
    <li> I thought they were creamy, I guess I didn&#x27;t read right. But they are a good and longlasting and very well pigmented. I can recommend!</li>
    <li> loved it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all definitely would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Not only it took so long but came in broken I&#x27;m so mad I been waiting impatiently for this product . I would return it back but it would take so long to hear back from them . Don&#x27;t buy this product they don&#x27;t handle with care.</li>
    <li> The amount of product you get for the price can&#x27;t be beat, but you certainly get what you pay for. I have to apply massive amounts to notice any difference on my skin. (I have a light/medium complexion, combination skin, and use a primer.) It also tends to fade after a couple hours, but the size of the container is too big to carry around and reapply.</li>
    <li> Recieved my contour powder palette and wow it was huge.but not too sure if powder is for me.it seems to me little harder to even out. I think I should of went with the cream.</li>
    <li> So mine came with a white, light color, another light color (they all look the same), a slightly darker light color, a neon orange, and a neon pink. So upset with my order, i basically have 4 powders that match my skin tone (I&#x27;m very fair) and two unusable neon blushes. Do not reccomend.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to work . but I used it a few times already and I am pleased with the results. Even though I only use one shade out of all of them. I think its good for light skin tones it blends well. I use it for contouring parts of my face and its good. Doesn&#x27;t look harsh.</li>
    <li> Far from professional. Stick to sephora, ladies. This palette is the same quality of Halloween makeup. It took forever to ship, and I threw it away after one application. It made me want to wash my face in scalding hot water and run straight to Ulta and confess my sins to the makeup gods.</li>
    <li> I received my powder very quickly especially since it was Christmas.  It really is a nice variety of colors and makes my shin feel like velvet!  I love it!</li>
    <li> so far, I just got it. This has a silky feel to it and creates a natural finish on my skin. I&#x27;ve used it for subtle contouring and to cover dark under eye circles. Under eye circles are tricky. If you use a cream concealer it can be shiny (especially in photos), powdering over it gets cakey, etc. Anyway, this is a nice, affordable, natural looking palette and I got complimented the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I could live without this. Great product and awesome buy. I use it almost everyday!</li>
    <li> Love this pallet perfect for contour</li>
    <li> Does not stay on the skin and smell like a chalk</li>
    <li> It works good but its not the most amazing thing. You actually need to know how to contour with liquids because it doesnt look nice when its just powders</li>
    <li> Usually with cheap cosmetics the pigments are too thin. I have pale skin and have difficulty finding a contour palette that isn&#x27;t too dark. This is perfect. Blends nicely. If you have darker skin than medium, this is not for you. Is this the best palette in the world? No. It&#x27;s definitely the best for the price you pay.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT. the colors blend beautifully and never look cakey. ideal for contouring!</li>
    <li> received in good conditions.</li>
    <li> Am going to return this product, it came with one color in the palette destroyed. It spilled over the other ones, making all 6 unusable. Not only this, but when I opened the box, it spilled all over anything that surrounded. Disappointing and would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Shipping was just as described and so was product. Very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> the good set for a Perfectly Contoured face and a nose, the only thing was required to me one more half tone for smooth transition. I use a peach shade as it is ruddy, perfectly refreshes the face.</li>
    <li> Way smaller then I thought and doesn&#x27;t blend as well as cream</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTLEY LOVE this product!!!! I have a deep tan skintone and it STILL works for me! I read the other reviews and I WAS scared, BUT I honestly have no IDEA what those other reviews were talking about. These aren&#x27;t supposed to be full cover, it&#x27;s supposed to be a finishing/setting/bloting power. I have been wearing one coat of this ALL day running errands in the rain here in seattle and guess what?? I still look fresh!!!&lt;br /&gt;So lets talk about the size... It&#x27;s HUGE!!!! like 6 regular pressed power compact size. It IS quite thin, but i don&#x27;t see any problems with that. Oh yeah, it&#x27;s extremely blendable and the case is matte so it looks very sexy. The only thing is that the lid is a bit flimsy (well mine was anyways) but it&#x27;s fine, I just need to be very careful not to abuse it. Other than that, I&#x27;m VERY glad about my purchase and very pleased with the quality overall. Welcome to my collection Frola powder palette!!</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for. I was really looking forward to these but sadly they are really powdery for my taste. They don&#x27;t really do the contouring I wanted.</li>
    <li> The product was smashed into pieces</li>
    <li> LOVE this contour set! All the right colors, my daughter (Caucasian and African-American) and I (Caucasian) can use the same set with no issues. It blends well, doesn&#x27;t have shimmer, and has lasted quite a while.</li>
    <li> Good product for the money.  Arrived in one piece and the colors are as pictured.  There&#x27;s a good amount of powder in each one so it looks like it will last me a while.</li>
    <li> Bellow expectation, smells weird and looks very powdery on skin. Don&#x27;t like it, it was waiste of my money.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about buying the  pallet. Price was great, reviews seems to be good. But when it came through the mail I was very upset. The palette was broken in half and the powder was just every where. Everything that came with that package was fine except for that specific pallet. SAD to say but I was really looking forward to it the most, only to be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Truly in love! This was a bigger palette than I though but it worked out nicely. I use all the colors and it is a great set for contouring and setting. Forever my go too until it is finished... might even buy a second one.</li>
    <li> Powders don&#x27;t give quite the pigment I was hoping for but looks ok on light colored skin.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. Mine came in perfect condition and it works so good with my skin! Don&#x27;t let the bad review change your mind, give it a try!</li>
    <li> Chalky and wouldn&#x27;t blend.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come with instructions on how to contour</li>
    <li> Neutral, not orange at all. I am fair skinned!!! Get tons of compliments. Better then a lot of high end bronzers I have bought, and I&#x27;ve bought a lot. Tons of friends want this palette after I showed them mine.</li>
    <li> Good, but not WOW! I used better that this palette.</li>
    <li> Was a little too powdery and thought the shades were darker but it came perfect nothing was broken so  happy about that</li>
    <li> Its larger than life. And I love the powdering contouring effects. Love it!</li>
    <li> Nice colors, but still too dark for very light complexions such as auburn, porcelain tones.</li>
    <li> This seems like a great product and for a great price, but it&#x27;s horrible. There&#x27;s no pigment what so ever and no matter how much I put on it doesn&#x27;t show anything. Save your money and do not get this. Even though the other ones are more expensive it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I love the look of this contouring kit,  but that being said,  my major issue with this is the fact that it&#x27;s been giving me acne.  Particularly in areas where the dark brown is being used.</li>
    <li> I received it broken I was super excited to get it and it was broken:( I&#x27;m giving it one star because it could have been packaged better it could&#x27;ve been protected  better bit has nothing to do with the actual product since I didn&#x27;t even get to try. I will return it.</li>
    <li> Came very fast and the pallets are bigger than I thought so that&#x27;s very nice. I only gave 4 stars because the darkest brown is broken</li>
    <li> Terrible!!!!!! Cheap and it really is so translucent you cannot see it.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup fanatic and gave this four stars only because it arrived smashed, and the bottom right dark color was broken. I read the reviews that this has happened before, so it&#x27;s a common thing. Also, when dipping your brush into the color the powder goes everywhere, but for $8 dollars I can&#x27;t really complain! Overall, the colors are good for contouring except the bottom right has just a hint or orange on my face so I use it sparingly to contour. I usually just use top right. I would buy again in hopes it doesn&#x27;t show up broken.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a palate that I could use to practice contouring, as I don&#x27;t have much experience with it.  I wanted to start with powder because I felt it would be easier to begin with as crème would probably look cakey first starting off.  The powder came a LOT lighter than I expected.  You have to apply a lot just to see the darker powder you would use to contour on your cheek bones.  I was pretty disappointed with this purchase and would probably recommend another product.  Maybe I am just not applying it correctly but I have been using powder make up for a while and this palate was just not an easy one for me.</li>
    <li> Great product. Packaging not so much. The case is very delicate. Afraid to pack for travel. Good coverage and blends great!</li>
    <li> i just recive it came broken i wont my money back or send me a new one. power all over the place when i open it</li>
    <li> I received it all broken, i tried fixing it but it&#x27;s not worth it, i didnt even know it was powder makeup, other wise i would&#x27;ve think twice about the purchase. the palette looks so cheap. i don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s good make-up for my face since everyone&#x27;s type of skin is so different. I will go ahead and trash it, that&#x27;s pretty much where it belongs.</li>
    <li> The product came broken</li>
    <li> Terrible product!. Burned my face after It has been put it on. Keep away from it. Strong chemicals smel. But investment</li>
    <li> This one is ok but i prefer creamy contours, it is my fault I didn&#x27;t notice that this one is powdery. If you like powder contouring so this one is for you.</li>
    <li> It has been 6 months since I have ordered, nothing yet, don&#x27;t waste your money ladies.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I am often sensitive to makeup and I had no problems at all with this product.</li>
    <li> Its good for the price. However, the colors arent as opaque as I was hoping. Very sheer coverage. Although, if youre looking for subtle, then this may be for you.</li>
    <li> The shades are nice and great for most skin tones. I didn&#x27;t realize how big the case is - this is like a small tablet! So that&#x27;s not great for travel, which is why I am giving it 4 stars. But that makes it a really great value.</li>
    <li> I bought this for simple countering/highlighting purposes for my own golden- olive colored skin. Upon receiving this product, I opened the box to a very large container- this makeup comes in a palate of about 10in by 6in- was pleasantly surprised by this. the makeup itself is a powder, again what i was not expecting, but this worked better for me since i prefer to wear as little face makeup as possible. VERY GOOD QUALITY FOR THE PRICE!</li>
    <li> Very long lasting powder. Great for highlighting under the eyes and was a lot better than expected. Seems cheap but is worth your money spent.</li>
    <li> Love this Pallet! Perfect shades for people with light to medium skin tones. I use mine for highlighting and contouring. For 10 bucks, its totally worth it. Will continue to rebuy.</li>
    <li> My fiance liked it,  she says it is light as she likes it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was not powdery as other people said</li>
    <li> Not much to say good or bad</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Very hard to deal with. Probably great for someone who knows what they&#x27;re doing, but not so much for a new beginner.</li>
    <li> No instructions. Not enough pigment. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> i didnt like it. packaging was so bad. İt is unfit.........</li>
    <li> Great for under eye and contouring.</li>
    <li> When I received this some of the powder was busted</li>
    <li> I was expected a foundation but it&#x27;s a powder I like it but it can be chalky but it was t expensive perfect for contouring practice</li>
    <li> Product was broken. Wish the shades were lighter. Still fairly dark/bronzey for a &amp;#34;light shade&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> First off, I believe presentation is everything. I was surprised when I opened the packaging to see it completely dusty and covered in what looked like smudges and fingerprints. If this product had been presented better (cleaner) I would have given it more stars. As far as the product itself, it offers very light pigment, nothing too drastic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only really used the bottom right 2 shades to contour and the orange/pink as blush but I love it!! I usually use MAC dark deep powder to contour, but find it leaves an me looking too orange? This powder is super fine and even tho it looks like a lot on the brush, once you start applying it it blends really nice. I love finding great products for cheap!! Oh and the pallete is big!!</li>
    <li> When I received, one of the palettes was broken, so powder everywhere in it, but over all I like the product.</li>
    <li> THEY&#x27;RE OK, WOULDN&#x27;T BUY THEM AGAIN :/</li>
    <li> It arrived broken. Not too pigmented</li>
    <li> item described and satisfied</li>
    <li> I purchased this pallet to try the contouring method that I had read about online. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money just to discover I hate the look or it is not suited for my face. Turns out I do like the look and this VERY reasonable pallet works great and I&#x27;ll continue to use it instead of replacing with a pricey-er version as I planned on. The colors have good pigmentation and none have cracked even thought I am not gentle with it. They last a full work day but you would probably have to reapply to go into evening. The only thing I would like better is if the highlighter was a bit better, it is just a white color instead of having some iridescence. Overall great buy for the money</li>
    <li> I did not get the palette I thought I was getting. I was under the impression that it was foundation powder/contour powder. Mine had 2 blush colors in it. The contour powder is much lighter than the one on the palette I was supposed to be getting. However, I ended up liking the blush colors and can use most of what&#x27;s in it. i do like it though. For the price, it&#x27;s a good product. I still wish I had been sent the one that I actually ordered.</li>
    <li> This compact is worth the money.  Product is light and easy to apply.  My only problem is the white was broken during shipping.  The company needs to provide additional padding so the powder isn&#x27;t broken when it arrives.</li>
    <li> Product arrived earlier than the estimated date. All powders were in tact, and I&#x27;ve enjoyed using them!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an alright product . Not the best but it gets the job done .</li>
    <li> Love this product. Good quality and turned out to be a lot more powder than I expected. Great value low cost and good quality. I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this seller.</li>
    <li> powder doesn&#x27;t even apply to the brush yet alone the face.</li>
    <li> Great price and product. The compact is huge!</li>
    <li> This is a nice palette. I love it and it&#x27;s way bigger than I expected. I didn&#x27;t see if it was powder or cream anywhere in the description so that is my only complaint. I had hopes that it was cream because I already have powder but that&#x27;s okay :)</li>
    <li> The product arrived very fast (less than a week) but the darkest powder was shattered when I opened it. I don&#x27;t know if that was on the person who delivered it but I was sad. I Put some contact solution in it to hopefully put it back together and that worked pretty well so its still useable. Pretty sad that it was broken though. Also, the actual compartment was broken too so it doesn&#x27;t open and close very well but over all the product is really good! Great colors for highlighting and contouring light and dark complexions. (:</li>
    <li> One of the colors was completely crushed, it seems like a good product though.</li>
    <li> Very transparent and difficult to see any true contour even before blending</li>
    <li> This product is good for the price. It is not super pigmented, which is fine with me because i would rather apply it in layers and build it up then it just be super pigmented and end up with too much. The colors are really pretty though and there is a shade for every skin tone to use to contour.</li>
    <li> Good gift. My sister loved it!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m new to contour.  This was probably a safe way to go, but I feel like I can&#x27;t see much color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably a good starter palette, but not very pigmented.</li>
    <li> The colors are very doll and not buildable they do not last long after applied. I&#x27;ve used it on multiple skin tones and most of the time it is too light or it looks like dirt is on their face. It is a good price to play with contouring to see if that works for you. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to be an end-all be-all.</li>
    <li> This was a great deal. I was looking on Pinterest for makeup tips for highlighting and shadowing. I knew the basics but wanted to know a little more for special occasions. On Pinterest it featured a set with only 3 colors and it was over 75.00. No thanks. So I googled highlight, shadow makeup sets. And up this pops. I had no idea until I got it it would be so large. Packaged very nicely and has extra colors for when my skin has different tones, like from winter to summer. Love it.</li>
    <li> For the price I think its so damn awesome and it came in perfectly :D I recommend !</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I received it today and used it and it was all I was expecting and more. Sleek packaging and beautiful design. Each powder is very pigmented and goes on very smoothly and blends exceptionally well. I was able to create a beautiful contour very easily with the selection of colors and even got many compliments on how &amp;#34;glowy&amp;#34; I looked. The package also arrived early and in great shape and I am exceptionally pleased with this buy. I definitely recommend this!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so angry! This was a gift and it came broken and a mess! This is completely unprofessional.</li>
    <li> I got most of the colors broken</li>
    <li> Was excited to get this item. The price was certainly right! However, one of the colors was broken up and powder was everywhere. Not bothering with returning but was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love love love!!!! Matte powders and when I run out I will buy again!!</li>
    <li> This is not for black girls ...the darker color came out ashy on my skin</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an affordable highlight/contour pallet that has colors light enough for someone with pale skin.  the price was so good I decided to try it and see if I liked it, and it is amazing.  the colors are very pigmented and blend out well. I am so glad I found this product and I am going to be getting this pallet for my sister in laws for a stocking stuffer for Christmas!!&lt;br /&gt;the colors are mostly matte, witch is awesome because a lot of the products I have seen are shiny and I have oily skin, so no extra shine is needed.</li>
    <li> I am so inlove with this! I use it every single day without fail! It is the perfect contour, blush, and highlight. I am about to buy another one.  I have super sensitive skin, and it did not cause me to break out, or irritate my skin in any way!  I am so happy I ordered this! I am a cosmetology student and everyone asks me where I got it, how I use it, and where can they get one!!  BEST PURCHASE EVER!</li>
    <li> I did order one and received two is someone else that happened to them at the comments, I did look through my order and I only ordered one so I&#x27;m not sure what happened there but I don&#x27;t mind! Both of my pallets came very clean and perfectly intact. However, the color pigmentation is not very impressive, but it&#x27;s expected for the price. I haven&#x27;t used it on my face yet but when swatching it on my hand I had to dip my finger into the pallet multiple times to get any color pay off. The first two light colors and the second two light brown colors are extremely similar, and the light brown colors come off too light to use for bronzing, which makes them basically useless. The white is a bit chalky for a highlight, and the yellowish color is weirdly brown tinted for a banana powder, which is what I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s trying to replicate. Although it&#x27;s described as a powder product, you can barely pick up any product using a brush because the temperature is just so strange... it almost feels like cream make up? Overall, it&#x27;s basically what you would expect for the price. It&#x27;s usable and it&#x27;s a good beginner pallet but there&#x27;s some things about it that just won&#x27;t do you any favors.</li>
    <li> Cheap powder your better off buying wet n wild seriously no pigment</li>
    <li> It came to my house covered in powder, every single one was broken, the palette itself broke on the hinge and when I contacted the company, no one answered. Terrible shipping and even when I did try to use the colors, they didn&#x27;t blend at all!</li>
    <li> -5 NOT waste your money and your time. This is garbage</li>
    <li> Super happy with my purchase. Easy to apply, great price, just a great product!</li>
    <li> Excellent. But the darkest shade to contour is still for a fair skinned person....</li>
    <li> One star really just because it arrived early. It was broken when I received it. Ugh. Such a mess all over my nice I have to give a speech clothes.</li>
    <li> its hard to mix the color..and it doesnt have any instruction, but the product is just gud for the price</li>
    <li> Chalky but does the job. The contour pallet came out to be larger than expected.</li>
    <li> Great price! I&#x27;ve had this pallet for a year now and it&#x27;s still my favorite. Great pigment and I love that it&#x27;s a powder because I have shiny skin. Seriously, it&#x27;s a steal! The photo I added was my face after 8 hours of work. The stuff lasts!</li>
    <li> I was worried about the makeup breaking while shipping but it didn&#x27;t! So happy with it! Great size, great pigment, great colors, and great price! I&#x27;m so happy I got is conpaired to going to Seporia and paying $45-55 for the same thing!</li>
    <li> As this is my first experience, not with contouring, but with a contouring kit I am giving it four stars as it met my expectations as far as color and blendability are concerned. However, it caused multiple break outs . I have almost always acne free skin and my skin is not sensitive to make up changes and I had multiple large blemishes occur after using this product a few times in a week.</li>
    <li> Took a month to arrive and each section was broken into powder.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to contouring with powder but I didn&#x27;t like the effect as much as I do with cream contouring. I&#x27;ll keep trying and edit my review if I feel differently.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE THIS!!!!. It arrived as scheduled, when I received the package I though amazon had sent a tablet or a kindle. Lol :). It arrived beautifully packaged,  I was amazed. The powder was intact and in GREAT condition. Ladies you need this product it does what I expected and more! !! GREAT BUY. THANK YOU!! :)</li>
    <li> Colors are pretty but more like kids makeup</li>
    <li> It was broken not happy at all</li>
    <li> greate price, awesome product</li>
    <li> Oh wow! This has been a great contour palette. Colors are very pigmented and work very well. Love this palette!</li>
    <li> I was so surprised at the quality of these powders! Paying a few bucks for such a large palette, I had my doubts but the powders are true to color, long wearing, and very soft. They are not chalky at all. These beat out some of my name brand face powders. I have light skin and all of these powder (except the white) are great! I don&#x27;t really know what the white powder is for? Great contouring, a great blush and the yellow powder is great for under eyes. All in all, great product!</li>
    <li> I really only use the darkest shade and the white translucent pod. I tried the blush but its very light. Overall, not a bad pallet.</li>
    <li> Great, cheap palette! I use this to contour over my foundation</li>
    <li> Thought it was a cream but over all bigger than expected great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this in a bundle and liked it so much that I&#x27;m buying it for my roommate as a gift! I was so shocked when it came in because it was a lot bigger than I expected. I didn&#x27;t read the description and thought it would be able the size of an eyeshadow palette (each color being about the size of a US Quarter), but I was wrong. You get a LOT of each color and the whole palette is about the size of an iPad mini. A few things you need a heads up about though...&lt;br /&gt;1. In case you didn&#x27;t notice, this is most likely a knock off product considering it has no company label or trademark on the case or box. This may or may not matter to you.&lt;br /&gt;2. It does work, HOWEVER, you may have to put a couple of layers on with SOME colors for them to be visible.&lt;br /&gt;3. This is a POWDER base/finish.&lt;br /&gt;4. Easy to rub and blend in which probably means it is easy to come off when you sweat, rub, or just wear it for a long period. I would suggest a spray makeup setter if you want to avoid this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and pigmented. Took very long to get here.</li>
    <li> I wanted nice real contouring makeup but I got this 6 colors one its very weak makeup</li>
    <li> These are ok, im not a professional make up artist, if i was maybe i would know how to use them more clearly, but i dont, i dont use them much because either the brushes i use or the makeup its self is hard to blend, stays on your face just how you put it</li>
    <li> This is the worst thing that you could possibly order!!!! Everything was broken the colors arent even the same that it shows on the picture first of all!!! I hate this palette do not waste not even a penny on this, they will rip u off!!!&lt;br /&gt;P.S i give it a -1 star</li>
    <li> I am very upset with my purchase the make up is crumbled and it&#x27;s the wrong color I don&#x27;t even want to order again I just want my money back</li>
    <li> The powder was all over the box. It was not handled with care. It was supposed to be a gift I just threw it away and bought another kind.</li>
    <li> very nice. easy to blend. pigmented. they&#x27;re sooo creamy. I definitely recommend this palette.</li>
    <li> Palette was the wrong one delivered and it was broke. It also smelled like paint, glad I&#x27;m just throwing it away, not worth trying to send back. $8 down the drain, but after smelling the product, I would not have put it anywhere near my face. Bad product, don&#x27;t waste your time!</li>
    <li> Huge!  Great colors for contouring. Love it</li>
    <li> Love love love this palette! It arrived so much sooner than I expected!</li>
    <li> Fabulous.... i like it worth the price!!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical because of the low price, but I&#x27;m happy to say this palette is awesome. The pigmentation is just enough for someone with fair skin. The bronzes do not have too much orange in them, so fair skin doesn&#x27;t look like either a bad tan or dirt on your face. They are very easy to blend as well. I&#x27;d dare say they work just as well as the more expensive brand palettes.</li>
    <li> If you are new to contouring, this is a great beginners product. Its light and blends easily, and is forgiving if you mess up (unlike liquid). However, if you are wanting a Kim Kardashian look, this is not the product for you. This doesn&#x27;t look caked on or gross. I&#x27;m happy with it, and since its not too heavy, it can be used for everyday wear (my personal opinion). I do not have strong bone structure, so contouring helps my face look more defined. I was weary buying this since so many people said their product showed up completely broken. Luckily, mine showed up looking just as it does in the picture. Would recommend for anyone wanting a subtle everyday contour look.</li>
    <li> One - the item arrived in a mess - with the powder all over the inside of the envelope. The white shade had cracked so badly is was a fine powder and unusable. Two - the colors that did survive the shipping were almost as useless with very little color. Even the darkest shade barely looked like a light blush after three applications.&lt;br /&gt;This product is not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I got it wayyyyyyy before scheduled, and it wasn&#x27;t broken bless God!!! But it couldn&#x27;t work for my skin tone, happy it was cheap, this palette isn&#x27;t for women of color!!!</li>
    <li> One of the powders was entirely busted and had spilled on everything.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product but the one that came in the mail was different colors.  The middle lower one looks more orange than it is in the picture.  Anyone know what I could use that orage color for?</li>
    <li> Love the powder- wish the case was sturdier as the powder cakes tend to crack/crumble with travel.</li>
    <li> Great product if u like power conture</li>
    <li> This is my everyday powder and blush. You cannot beat this for the price. Great for highlighting and contouring. This girl has a double chin and I can minimize it to a T with this powder. Will be buying again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I recommend for starters</li>
    <li> Great product. I just got into make up, didn&#x27;t want to spend an arm and a leg to play around in make up. The quality of this make up is amazing.</li>
    <li> came perfectly! i suggest this product if youre a super pale person like myself. even the darkest shade doesnt go on very dark. its powdery, but overall a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually bought two of these to date with no issues. For me, the powder lasts all day, is easily applied and didn&#x27;t cause any irritation. Both times the product came to me in perfect condition. I do struggle with contouring  a bit - the dark colors are not easily blendable on my skin (I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of my very white porcelain skin) so I don&#x27;t really use it for contouring but I love using the 4 light colors on the left as highlighter and occasionally to add some color to my face and ignore the last 2 dark colors on the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this pallet for different reasons and NOT for contouring my face as the contour is awful and you can&#x27;t blend, I suggest you do not buy this pallet if you want to use the dark colors to contour and to just get a bronzer.</li>
