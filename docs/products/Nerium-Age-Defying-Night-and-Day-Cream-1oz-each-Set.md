      <li>I like this product very much.  </li>
      <li>Love this product, I will definitely be a return buyer.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery also!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed all that much difference in my skin since I first started using it</li>
      <li>I have never before been able to rid my skin of dry flakey areas.</li>
      <li>I have had this two times and really could not tell difference when I was using, but noticed my skin look</li>
      <li>Over priced network marketing company representatives selling their free supplies to get back their investment because it does not work as advertised.</li>

      <li>really like this cream.</li>
      <li>This stuff is the real McCoy.  </li>

      <li>Seems to do the job very well.</li>
      <li>Order came quickly and it was exactly what I had expected.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product after seeing before and after shots of customers.</li>

      <li>Finally found a product that really works!</li>

      <li>It has far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
      <li>Seems to be a good moisturizer, however the Nerium AD night cream has a strong odor which is sorta sickening to me.  </li>
      <li>Although the pores on my face were not large and deep, they were certainly noticeable and always bothered me; makeup didn&#x27;t really camouflage them.</li>
      <li>I was very surprised to see this for sale on Amazon because on my receipts it clearly states that this product will not be be sold on ANY mass market web sites such as eBay , Amazon or retail sites .</li>
      <li>How do I get my money back or a new night cream?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Working great so far.  Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This really clears my face and cleans and give it a smooth feeling</li>
    <li> There was a little silver thing in the spout. It could have been used some and put back. I wasn&#x27;t happy that it wasn&#x27;t sealed better.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I will definitely be a return buyer.  It has far exceeded my expectations.  I could feel and see improvement in my skin tone, dark spot lightening and smaller pores.</li>
    <li> Reformed Botox junkie : This is without a doubt the best cream I have ever used !!! I have spent thousands of dollars on facial creams , serums , potions , Botox , fillers ... Then I tried Nirium day cream and night cream and I couldn&#x27;t believe I found a product that actually works ! It has smoothed and tightened my skin like nothing else I have ever used . I was very surprised to see this for sale on Amazon because on my receipts it clearly states that this product will not be be sold on ANY mass market web sites such as eBay , Amazon or retail sites . If you find this product anything less than amazing and love it so much you want to spread the word to your friends and family you may not be getting the actual Nirium product . I enclosed a picture of the statement on my latest receipt .</li>
    <li> I love it so far. My skin looks fresher and firmer- younger! I only use one to two pump each time because four pumps made my skin really greasy and breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;My friends and co worker noticed the improvement after two weeks use, and plus I have a few more compliments from my patient how attractive I look as well since I started using nerium night and day cream.</li>
    <li> Order came quickly and it was exactly what I had expected.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery, came just as described. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> a helpful anti aging antidote. Help diminish age sp[ots</li>
    <li> I like this product. I have been using it for 5 months now and see a difference. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Perfect for oily skin, far from greasy and it&#x27;s not some miracle drug that will give you a face lift overnight but I can definitely tell my neck and face don&#x27;t sag as it should be at my age. Or atleast that&#x27;s what I been told! Seller shipped this to me super fast - many thanks for that!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing but to save a few dollars you never know what your getting!!! This should be bought from a brand partner and then you can get your product for free!!! Check out my website KeliThomas.nerium.com</li>
    <li> Product is old, hardly comes out of the bottle! The day time is ok, but night time I can&#x27;t use! A bit disappointed .,..</li>
    <li> I love this product. Although the pores on my face were not large and deep, they were certainly noticeable and always bothered me; makeup didn&#x27;t really camouflage them. I have been using this product for about 5 months. After the first 6 weeks, my pores were significantly reduced. With continued use, they are hard noticeable!</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this product and can see results already  Skin is soft ,even in tone and pores are smaller</li>
    <li> The night cream works, love it, will buy it again. The day cream isn&#x27;t thick enough and doesn&#x27;t give my skin the moisture it needs.</li>
    <li> Probably a good product.  I didn&#x27;t like the smell much.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.  My skin is looking very good.</li>
    <li> I do see any difference I used it for 10 months</li>
    <li> It looks like it is working I love the feel of it</li>
    <li> this is the second set I&#x27;ve bought in the last 3 months and both times the night lotion pump does not work properly at all, i thought that it was because the cream was heavy and difficult to pump out so i went and bought one thru a lady seller in my area and did not have problem at ALL!</li>
    <li> because the cream are expired and make my face red and relly dry i dont recoment buy this cream here,</li>
    <li> Horrible!! thats all I have to say I broke out more then a teenager dose at puberty! Having a hard time clearing my skin. Don&#x27;t buy this cream!!</li>
    <li> I learned about these products from my (10 years younger) sister. She physically showed me &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; photos that she had taken and then had me look at her skin in person at our family reunion. Definitely positive results!</li>
    <li> Overpriced and over rated.</li>
    <li> It does not work, it is simply Tomato oils.</li>
    <li> I receive my product and the night cream is empty even though it was sealed. Not sure about the day cream. Got 3 uses from night cream. Would like this rectified asap please</li>
    <li> Great product.  Skin looks and feels tighter</li>
    <li> Same exact product for half the price and no auto shipment required.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a month ago. I honestly didn&#x27;t think that it was going to work the way it did. Not only does this skin care product work, but it&#x27;s also great for my sensitive oily skin.  The overall appearance of my skin has improved 90% I couldn&#x27;t ask for better results!  The price is unbeatable! This includes the complete set. The product has a night and day version which ensures that you will receive the best results. I will be a repeat customer for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;A++</li>
    <li> I did not get the gift, that it was coming adverstising.</li>
    <li> This product have made my skin smoother and tighter. At 52 I&#x27;m told I look young!</li>
    <li> Works really great, love it.</li>
    <li> I use this and the day cream. There are no harmful side effect. The dark spots I had is gone and my pores are way smaller. Make sure you get these from a brand partner. chrisfchan.nerium.com if you need help.</li>
    <li> Am not satisfied with the product I don&#x27;t see any difference on my face and the day crean don&#x27;t  don&#x27;t even less me 1 month.i wish I can ask for my money back.</li>
    <li> my mom ordered a set of this product and it does a great job, especially the Night Cream. I can see a difference on my moms face Will order more soon for myself!</li>
    <li> My wife loved it. She said that the cream is working</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this and it&#x27;s great for my skin. After one month I see NO change in fine lines or any wrinkles. Improvements I do see are great clarity, tone, fewer clogged pores, and mist important for me, No flakiness. I have never before been able to rid my skin of dry flakey areas. For that reason alone I will buy it.</li>
    <li> Love night time Nerium. I find leaving my face damp then applying the product that I use less. The fragrance does not bother me. The daytime Nerium is just okay.... I probably will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> seemed to make skin very dry instead of moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Great creams-no perfumes. Night cream is thick like a mask but doesn&#x27;t harden. Day cream is light and nourishing. Grest comb.</li>
    <li> Fabulous love this product.</li>
    <li> Finally found a product that really works! I have tried a lot of expensive products that failed to improve my skin. Nerium works! I&#x27;ve tossed all of the other products I have accumulated and will only use Nerium from now on!</li>
    <li> I have definately seen a difference! The lines on my face and neck have diminished a significant amount and a close friend referred me to nerium and her changes are what sold me if the first place! Love it!</li>
    <li> The daytime serum had a crack below the spout, but seemed okay. I didn&#x27;t notice it for a few days, so I&#x27;m not sure when it happened.</li>
    <li> Wow. Please avoid this product at all costs. I started using this product about a month ago, purchased through this amazon account. I took before and after pictures so I could share with my friends. My &#x27;after&#x27; pictures are getting worse and worse. Ive never had dark spots appear on my face before and they are showing up all over the place. I also didn&#x27;t have many wrinkles (I&#x27;m 29 years old) and now they&#x27;re are fine lines EVERYWHERE. It&#x27;s like the product is drying out my skin but it&#x27;s simultaneously extremely greasy? The day cream is SOOOO GREASY and doesn&#x27;t absorb well. I thought since this product was so expensive it must work!&lt;br /&gt;Thats not all.&lt;br /&gt;I called customer service to talk to an adverse reaction specialist. Had to put in a &amp;#34;request&amp;#34; to talk to someone. I get a message on my phone with a phone number that just takes me back to customer service where i&#x27;m told I have to put in another request. There was no one at the customer service center who knew anything about the product, it&#x27;s ingredients, and reaction with different skin types. If you&#x27;re selling a $100+ product, please be able to talk to people about their skin. No one that I spoke with was eloquent. When I asked to speak to the manager, THEY HUNG UP ON ME. Are. You. Serious? Please avoid this product. Definitely a pyramid scheme/scam.</li>
    <li> Nice and I&#x27;m one satisfied customer</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my wife and she seems to like it very well. Seems to do the job very well.</li>
    <li> I love it !!! Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months now and will never use anything else again. I used to sell Avon and used their anti-aging lotion and it doesn&#x27;t even compare to Nerium! I love the result it&#x27;s had on my skin. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> I like it because it made my pores small again.</li>
    <li> not a good product, would not buy it.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t go very far for the cost. I used it as suggested and it felt as though it was doing something. The day cream had a nice feel to it and I was able to use it under make up. It just didn&#x27;t last very long and it is expensive.</li>
    <li> really like this cream. i have noticed a diiference in my face</li>
    <li> came in not even able to use it</li>
    <li> I love the day and night cream! I have tried tons of products from clinique to loreal and this works best for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The product arrived as expected, in the original package.</li>
    <li> I love nerium..it smoothed my face and diminshes my wrinkles.. The deep ones and small around my eyes</li>
    <li> A little change not like I thought disappointed</li>
    <li> Never saw a difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;But the product was sealed in a new box,and came as expected. Hopefully it works for other skin types</li>
    <li> This stuff is like a miracle!</li>
    <li> Not good I&#x27;m still the same</li>
    <li> noticable results.very happy with the product. used 6 wks lost bout 4 -5 yrs of wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product after seeing before and after shots of customers. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and have not seen the same results.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with my order.</li>
    <li> great price, wonderful product, fast ship</li>
    <li> This stuff is the real McCoy.  I can honestly say I see a difference.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good moisturizer, however the Nerium AD night cream has a strong odor which is sorta sickening to me.  But other than that, it is a product.</li>
    <li> Too sticky and smelly</li>
    <li> Felt and see difference in my facial skin</li>
    <li> I like that cream.  It  is good for an aging skin.  But you can  store that cream without the tiny stopper  which impossible to find on the counter without glasses and it came in torn off  package.</li>
    <li> I have had this two times and really could not tell difference when I was using, but noticed my skin look&lt;br /&gt;more wrinkled when I quit using.  My bottles were not sealed.....just the little silver thing.  I ordered from one of Amazon individual sites.  I am now wondering if I was even getting the good product and wondering why she would have this large of a supply.</li>
    <li> The day cream is fine.  I could not say what the night cream is like.  It pumped 4 times and then no long works.  How do I get my money back or a new night cream?</li>
    <li> Randomly I saw this  this product on Instagram and thought that it was a joke on the results but I have been noticing a change and the more you use it the better it seems to work</li>
    <li> Love the resulta this creams give me, will repurchase</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast delivery also!</li>
    <li> Absolute junk that smells as bad as it works. Over priced network marketing company representatives selling their free supplies to get back their investment because it does not work as advertised. Product does not work period DO YOUR RESEARCH, smells bad and for the money you could buy several other products that work better.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed all that much difference in my skin since I first started using it but it has made a world of difference in my kids acne. Up until this point I hadn&#x27;t been able to find anything that worked all that well on their acne but after a couple of days of using the nerium we could already see results and for that reason alone I will continue buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* We are just using the day cream twice a day to treat the acne.</li>
