      <li>The best out of the bunch.</li>
      <li>Great for our guest bathrooms!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re a person who likes a variety of scents, this might be the perfect pack for you.</li>
      <li>That makes me very happy, as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The soap lathers well, and smells great!</li>
      <li>The packaging wasn&#x27;t the greatest, as the bottles looked like they had been tossed into the box.</li>
      <li>Great buy too.</li>
      <li>This is a nice variety pack and the soaps smell wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Great soaps.</li>
      <li>but we really liked the mango and grape the best.</li>
      <li>The soap cleans well, the transparent bottles show off the bright colors.</li>
      <li>I like a good foamy lather when I&#x27;m using a liquid hand soap.</li>
      <li>I have given some of the bottles to friends and they are all delighted with them.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>They also do a good job on the cleaning side of things.</li>
      <li>This is a really good set of hand soaps.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good to know that the Mango Ice Cream soap sells as a bar soap and as a pack of 12, 10 oz bottles here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>This is a good variety of scented liquid soaps.</li>
      <li>but I feel these are superior to those.  </li>
      <li>LOVE THEM ALL!</li>
      <li>Every scent is pleasant and enjoyable.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The soaps are scented but the scents aren’t that great or overly strong.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m always on the lookout for liquid soap that doesn&#x27;t have an antibacterial component (too drying/makes hands more susceptible to germs), lathers &amp; rinses well, and has a pleasant but not overpowering scent.</li>
      <li>The smell was amazing</li>
      <li>The containers look nice as well, which is a bonus.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a nice set of soap.</li>
      <li>This was a nice variety pack of hand soaps.</li>
      <li>All six scents were nice.</li>
      <li>I really liked the mango.  </li>
      <li>and I liked the feel of it.</li>
      <li>This is a nice sample pack to try.</li>
      <li>I love a fancy, good smelling soap.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice after you wash, but it&#x27;s not overbearing.</li>
      <li>These soaps have a fantastic smell and they foam up very nicely.</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
      <li>The good news is it isn&#x27;t as strong, in my opinion, as the cherry pie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The others were not as strong and therefore I liked them a lot more.</li>
      <li>The great thing is that not only is the smell pleasant, none are overpowering.</li>
      <li>These hand soaps work fine and are a nice size to sit by the sink.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s OK though.</li>
      <li>The pearl white Mango Ice-Cream choice has worked best at not drying out my hands.</li>
      <li>The different scents are not overpowering but delightful.</li>
      <li>I love this set of six liquid hand soaps.</li>
      <li>Some fragrances are better than others.</li>
      <li>and my hands feel more fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Cherry blossoms is okay, but why have two cherry flavors?</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t overly pleased with the almond/olive oil.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Cherry Pie was my favorite.</li>
      <li>The scents are lovely, and remind me of the bar soaps.</li>
      <li>I love the variety, and none of them are overpowering.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, upon arrival, the top on one soap was broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However I did have to take a star off for the two cherry flavors and the overwhelming scent of one of them.</li>
      <li>The bottles are generously sized and for the most part the scents are pleasant and don&#x27;t overwhelm me-- with the exception of the Mango Ice Cream, which is pretty potent.</li>
      <li>These soaps are pretty good.</li>
      <li>nice variety of fragrances for a mild hand soap.</li>
      <li>Ice Cream- pearl white, delicious, scrumptious mango fragrance with a light undertone of cream.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t very true to life scents but smell</li>
      <li>The Blueberry Parfait and Cherry Pie are very sweet and fruity.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, I recommend this as a great choice!</li>
      <li>They do smell lovely, and clean up a treat.</li>
      <li>, it slithers around your hand and coats it with some kind of sense of a veneer, just hanging on for hours, like a soft shell coating, and the artificially strong odor of the day is carried with your like some kinds of bubble gums are able to do.  </li>
      <li>Beautiful pump containers full of six different fragrances, almond (sophisticated and subtle), blueberry parfait (sweet), cherry blossom (delightful), cherry pie (sweet smelling), mango ice cream (nice) and olive oil.</li>
      <li>Nobody liked the almond and about a third liked the mango and cherry.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t worth to price!</li>
      <li>Nothing amazing, but a few of them smell really good.</li>
      <li>leaving my hands clean.</li>
      <li>Even takes gardening grime right off!</li>
      <li>Its great that you can get a variety of scents in one single pack!</li>
      <li>They wash off very thoroughly, and don&#x27;t feel like they leave a residue on your hands (except that lovely</li>
      <li>Good for houses where you need multiple hand soaps.</li>
      <li>While the Mango Ice Cream and Cherry Blossom are sweet with vanilla and flowery tones.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Finally, blueberry was good.  </li>
      <li>So sing Happy Birthday regardless of the soap you use and don&#x27;t try to cut down on your time.</li>
      <li>If you had this in a bathroom or something for kids to use, you&#x27;d blow through it incredibly wastefully because they&#x27;d always get at least four times what they needed.</li>
      <li>My hands feel clean and soft after using them with the scent lingering but not too strong.</li>
      <li>A couple (mainly the Gourmet scents) were just to strong and overpowering for</li>
      <li>The variety pack was fun for everyone to choose their scent</li>
      <li>I also would have preferred to have the gold pumps on the more mature</li>
      <li>They do seem to clean your hands well and have a strong scent, I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s from the natural extracts</li>
      <li>The more mature scents (olive oil,almond and cherry blossom) could go in the grown folks bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Mango Ice Cream soap would certainly be worth buying in quantity.</li>
      <li>These are a lot of fun.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of strong scents and this one is light enough to not bother me.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;These are great soaps that I would definitely purchase in the future if the price was right.</li>
      <li>My hands smell nice and this doesn&#x27;t dry them out like some soaps I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>At less than $2.33 a piece, these hand soaps are a pretty good value.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The bottles are larger than most pump soaps.  </li>
      <li>Its great to get a variety pack, but I found myself not loving</li>
      <li>First time I have ever used Duru liquid soap was the chery pie.</li>
      <li>They seem higher end than say a 99 cents store Dial soap</li>
      <li>All in all, these definitely aren&#x27;t our favorite handsoaps</li>
      <li>With six different scents included in this pack, you should easily be able to find something for everyone in the house.  </li>
      <li>However, my advice to them is clean up the label; people who want to purchase natural products don&#x27;t want to grab a magnifying glass to read the label.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall these soaps do what they need to, clean your hands and leave them soft.</li>
      <li>As every teacher knows you have to wash your hands regularly throughout the day to stay healthy, which is very drying.</li>
      <li>so many different languages on the packaging that you can&#x27;t really tell with the manufacture is trying to say.</li>
      <li>lovely cherry fragrance, neither too heavy or light.</li>
      <li>Often times, liquid soap has a overly strong scent added to it, and it doesn&#x27;t smell of actual soap.</li>
      <li>The scents are very pretty and leave your hands feeling soft.</li>
      <li>The Olive Oil and Almond Extract was my least favorite, they both just smell like cheap</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I don&#x27;t care for oily soaps with heavy perfumes and if you do -- this is the product for you!  I get it, it slithers around your hand and coats it with some kind of sense of a veneer, just hanging on for hours, like a soft shell coating, and the artificially strong odor of the day is carried with your like some kinds of bubble gums are able to do.  But that&#x27;s not for me. I like a mild smelling soap and that feeling that it washed off with all the grimy little germs it grabbed a hold of and my skin if free from contaminents. Probably all myth of the mind, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t work for my delusions of what a hand soap should be. Pass.</li>
    <li> This soap smells great, and a little goes a long way. Even takes gardening grime right off! The containers look nice as well, which is a bonus. Buying a multi-pack is my favorite way to go, as it means there&#x27;s always a backup available, but I expect this pack to last an extremely long time given how little I need per use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product/brand does not seem to show up on the EWG Skin Deep database, but a quick search of the main ingredients shows only clean ingredients (all rated at 3 or less - considered safe). That makes me very happy, as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this product is that the pump dispenses WAY more than you need per use! I use only a fraction of a pump each time and it&#x27;s plenty. If you had this in a bathroom or something for kids to use, you&#x27;d blow through it incredibly wastefully because they&#x27;d always get at least four times what they needed. It sounds minor, but it&#x27;s noticeable. Other than that, I recommend this as a great choice!</li>
    <li> We are currently on our 1st bottle and a little goes a long way, so this hand soap will last quite a while. The scents are very pretty and leave your hands feeling soft. Also, the price for 6 bottles is a steal for this quality of soap! I would definitely purchase these over Bath &amp; Body Works liquid soaps in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside was when I did receive these items, some of the liquid leaked out and it was a bit of a messy clean up because the bottles appeared to be thrown into the box. I would recommend a better way of packing items like these so that there’s less of a chance of items being  tossed and whipped around in the box during shipping.</li>
    <li> This was a nice variety pack of hand soaps. With 6 different scents, it&#x27;s hard to get bored. The bottles are generously sized and for the most part the scents are pleasant and don&#x27;t overwhelm me-- with the exception of the Mango Ice Cream, which is pretty potent. The ingredient list is in very tiny lettering on the back, so I was unable to determine if these soaps contain triclosan, the ingredient that kills germs. However you have to wash for 20 seconds to kill the germs whether you have the triclosan or not. So sing Happy Birthday regardless of the soap you use and don&#x27;t try to cut down on your time. Amazon also sells refills for some of the scents, so check those out and see if you can refill your pump for less money. (Sorry but I was told there would be no math for this.) Buy them, use them, and do something different from the same old Dial pump that everyone else has in their kitchens and bathrooms.</li>
    <li> This is a really good set of hand soaps. The smell is nice after you wash, but it&#x27;s not overbearing. The scent doesn&#x27;t last long, but it leaves your hands feeling soft.</li>
    <li> These are some really nice smelling soaps whose scents will linger on your hands unless you rinse longer than usual.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong... I am not complaining because I actually like the faint, lingering scent.  I love the variety, and none of them are overpowering.  I do not find these soaps to cause excessive drying at all.  Also, they lather up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are larger than most pump soaps.  I just saw in the product description that they are 25% larger, which is nice if you hate having to constantly refill or buy new ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The labels have a lot of different languages on them, and the names of the scents are in different places depending on the bottle.  So I was searching each one for a few seconds to find the name of the scent.  Again, not complaining, it was just weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great soaps that I would definitely purchase in the future if the price was right.</li>
    <li> In the classroom I go through a lot of liquid soap because to use the harsh antibacterial soap provided for students is not an option. As every teacher knows you have to wash your hands regularly throughout the day to stay healthy, which is very drying. So I&#x27;m always on the lookout for liquid soap that doesn&#x27;t have an antibacterial component (too drying/makes hands more susceptible to germs), lathers &amp; rinses well, and has a pleasant but not overpowering scent. I also prefer to use a USA product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set of six Duru soaps doesn&#x27;t have added antibacterial ingredients &amp; does have glycerin which helps combat drying. Although, I haven&#x27;t found these soaps to improve my hands softness as other glycerin soaps have done. The pearl white Mango Ice-Cream choice has worked best at not drying out my hands. All of the choices lather &amp; rinse very well leaving my hands clean. The scent of each is on the artificial flowery sweet side that gives a blast of scent, but thankfully doesn&#x27;t linger long afterwards. The pump works well enough, although one of them came loose during shipping &amp; leaked over everything. The price at just over $2 each is reasonable, but you can find similar quality soaps for far less at all grocery stores. This is not a product made in the U.S., and Amazon doesn&#x27;t provide the country of origin, but upon investigation it appears to be made in Turkey.</li>
    <li> These hand soaps work fine and are a nice size to sit by the sink. The variety pack was fun for everyone to choose their scent but we really liked the mango and grape the best.</li>
    <li> Yes, you can find liquid soap at a dollar store but I feel these are superior to those.  The scents are stronger, they foam up very well and my hands feel more fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest issue you&#x27;ll have is deciding which scent to use and where to use it.  Some of the scents may be a turn-off for some people in your family, however, the scents won&#x27;t knock anybody out.  The two cherries are actually a little different.  I wasn&#x27;t overly pleased with the almond/olive oil.  I really liked the mango.  Finally, blueberry was good.  BUT...mango was my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a nice set of soap.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I found very few of these soaps to have tolerable scents. The almond in particular smelled nothing at all like almonds and rather like a poor and completely synthetic attempt at creating a nutty smell. The Olive Oil too was completely artificial and unenjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blueberry and cherry were ok but not worth buying as part of this variety pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To see if I was just unreasonable about the scents I put all of the bottles in my company&#x27;s kitchen for folks to try. The 10 people who tried them out had essentially the same thoughts as me. The one that received at least 50% positive reviews was the blueberry scent. Nobody liked the almond and about a third liked the mango and cherry.</li>
    <li> These Duru liquid soaps are hit or miss. The cherry scents are absolutely awful and made our hands smell like cherry Nyquil, so we sadly had to dispose of them because they were unbearable. The other scents are mostly decent; the almond smells like regular scented handsoap and the others have a tolerable fruity scent. All in all, these definitely aren&#x27;t our favorite handsoaps and I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;d order them again, but they seem to work and at least a few of the scents aren&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> The scents are lovely, and remind me of the bar soaps. Often times, liquid soap has a overly strong scent added to it, and it doesn&#x27;t smell of actual soap. I like that weird bar soap smell. It&#x27;s hard to describe unless you associate it with quiet nights in after a long day running around. These liquid soaps all have that bar soap baseline fragrance, overlaid with whatever flavour they&#x27;re supposed to have. Here&#x27;s the thing though; they don&#x27;t actually smell like what&#x27;s on the bottle. The Mango Ice Cream smells like neither mango, nor ice cream. It doesn&#x27;t smell like mango ice cream itself either. It smells like what someone who&#x27;s only read about a mango would think of when they scented a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s OK though. The multiple languages on the packaging, the hardy smell, and the lack of pretension about the artificial scents added to this soap are all charming as heck. They do smell lovely, and clean up a treat. They wash off very thoroughly, and don&#x27;t feel like they leave a residue on your hands (except that lovely smell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I docked 1 star though, because the lather is very unsatisfying. I like a good foamy lather when I&#x27;m using a liquid hand soap. Just be willing to keep an open mind, and you&#x27;re likely to enjoy these soaps.</li>
    <li> Just regular hand soap, nothing special. Don&#x27;t worth to price!</li>
    <li> I’m not really impressed with this soap. I love a fancy, good smelling soap. This soap was pretty disappointing. It smells like soap that you’d use in a restaurant or gas station. It’s very soapy smelling and not luxury soap smelling at all. The performance is just average. It doesn&#x27;t lather very well. The packaging, scents and performance are on par with Dollar Store soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also pretty annoying that there are three languages on the soap bottle, you really have to search to even find the name or scent of the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soaps are scented but the scents aren’t that great or overly strong. They aren&#x27;t very true to life scents but smell artifical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, upon arrival, the top on one soap was broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gourmet line:&lt;br /&gt;Cherry Pie&lt;br /&gt;Blueberry Parfait&lt;br /&gt;Mango Ice Cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural line:&lt;br /&gt;Olive Oil&lt;br /&gt;Cherry Blossom&lt;br /&gt;Almond Extract&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cherry Pie was my favorite. The Olive Oil and Almond Extract was my least favorite, they both just smell like cheap soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely rather use Bath and Body Works or even Dial or Softsoap.</li>
    <li> These soaps smell divine. I was skeptical about the different fragrances and do like some more than others, but what a great mix!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Almond and Olive Oil scents are lighter. The Blueberry Parfait and Cherry Pie are very sweet and fruity.  While the Mango Ice Cream and Cherry Blossom are sweet with vanilla and flowery tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are silky and creamy without being too heavy. Great for our guest bathrooms!</li>
    <li> Overall I like the Duru liquid soaps. They do seem to clean your hands well and have a strong scent, I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s from the natural extracts the manufacture claims to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say claims because the ingredient information is impossible to read with a magnifying glass. There are literally so many different languages on the packaging that you can&#x27;t really tell with the manufacture is trying to say. The soap lathers well but is a bit difficult to wash off with soft water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it&#x27;s a good product. However, my advice to them is clean up the label; people who want to purchase natural products don&#x27;t want to grab a magnifying glass to read the label. I&#x27;ve included a photo of the backside of the packaging with a penny on it to show the scale of the text.</li>
    <li> At less than $2.33 a piece, these hand soaps are a pretty good value. Each has a pump and is a little over 10 ounces. The soap lathers well enough, but the fragrance on your hands doesn&#x27;t last incredibly long. The glycerine does leaves my hands feeling soft, so that&#x27;s nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almond Extract- orange colored, mild, clean soapy smell reminiscent of Ivory soap, with a tiny hint of almond fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Olive Oil- green colored, again, mild soapy smell, hints of olive oil fragrance that is stronger than the almond fragrance in the almond extract soap.&lt;br /&gt;Blueberry- lavender colored, a bit too candy smelling for me,no real blueberry fragrance, but overall not off putting.&lt;br /&gt;Cherry Blossom- light pink colored, most artificial smell out of the bunch, sort of cherry cough syrup smelling, most disappointing fragrance of the group.&lt;br /&gt;Cherry Pie- darker pink, lovely cherry fragrance, neither too heavy or light. They got this one right.&lt;br /&gt;Mango Ice Cream- pearl white, delicious, scrumptious mango fragrance with a light undertone of cream. The best out of the bunch. Mango Ice Cream could rival hand soap you get at Bath and Body Works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall these soaps do what they need to, clean your hands and leave them soft. Some fragrances are better than others. For a bit over $2 a piece, don&#x27;t expect expensive smelling soaps like Yardley of London (which is about $6 for 8 oz on Amazon at the time of this review). This is a nice sample pack to try. It&#x27;s good to know that the Mango Ice Cream soap sells as a bar soap and as a pack of 12, 10 oz bottles here on Amazon. The Mango Ice Cream soap would certainly be worth buying in quantity.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap variety pack. The different scents are not overpowering but delightful. I have given some of the bottles to friends and they are all delighted with them. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> Great soaps. This is a nice variety pack and the soaps smell wonderful.  Every scent is pleasant and enjoyable. Great buy too.</li>
    <li> LOVE THEM ALL! Its great that you can get a variety of scents in one single pack! The soap lathers well, and smells great! Good for houses where you need multiple hand soaps. The bottles are slim, so they don&#x27;t take up much room, and for me I was able to use up 99% of the soap in the bottle, so very little waste. Never heard of this brand previous to this use, but if I seen in the store; or if it becomes erodible again I will order.</li>
    <li> First time I have ever used Duru liquid soap was the chery pie. The smell was amazing and I liked the feel of it. I decided to try another and then another so far have not found any of the smells I didn&#x27;t like. Yes I will buy these again.</li>
    <li> I found this soap to be very similar to dish soap in terms of how it smells and made my hands feel.  It feels sort of oily and slimy going on, does not really lather up very well, and then was a little hard to rinse off.  The scents were just &amp;#34;all right&amp;#34;--not offensive, but not enticing, either.  I cannot really recommend it.</li>
    <li> These soaps are pretty good. Nothing amazing, but a few of them smell really good. A couple (mainly the Gourmet scents) were just to strong and overpowering for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how it cleans, it&#x27;s does what it&#x27;s supposed to do! My hands smell nice and this doesn&#x27;t dry them out like some soaps I&#x27;ve tried. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend most of these (the Cherry scent is just awful), and you do get a lot of soap for your money!</li>
    <li> This product is hard to review because of the different scents you receive.  Its great to get a variety pack, but I found myself not loving all the scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cherry pie was the worst scent for me. I washed my hands and the smell lingered. This is really annoying if you wash your hands first and then have to eat. I found that the only thing I could smell was the fragrance of the soap, which did not make me want to eat. Cherry blossoms is okay, but why have two cherry flavors? The good news is it isn&#x27;t as strong, in my opinion, as the cherry pie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The others were not as strong and therefore I liked them a lot more. Olive oil is my favorite because of its subtle fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These soaps do not produce a lot of lather, but they get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I do like these soaps. However I did have to take a star off for the two cherry flavors and the overwhelming scent of one of them.</li>
    <li> With six different scents included in this pack, you should easily be able to find something for everyone in the house.  We started off with the almond extract scent.  I like it.  I&#x27;m not a fan of strong scents and this one is light enough to not bother me.  The soap lathered and cleaned our hands quite well.  The bottles are larger than the soap bottles I typically use, so I expect these to last a bit longer.  So far, I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> These soaps have a fantastic smell and they foam up very nicely. My hands feel clean and soft after using them with the scent lingering but not too strong. I have one in each bathroom of the house!</li>
    <li> nice variety of fragrances for a mild hand soap.</li>
    <li> I love this set of six liquid hand soaps. I like the variety of scents. I highly recommend the set for homes with multiple baths. You could put the fruity scents (blueberry,cherry pie and mango) in the kids baths. The more mature scents (olive oil,almond and cherry blossom) could go in the grown folks bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the scents lather and rinse well. These are highly scented but the scents fade quickly to a barely there level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a few quibbles :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The pumps are not the highest quality. They seem higher end than say a 99 cents store Dial soap but still I feel they should be nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I also would have preferred to have the gold pumps on the more mature scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Sometimes the bottle crushes in a little bit with pumping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I like to read the backs of bottles ...These bottles have the smallest print ever!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a person who likes a variety of scents, this might be the perfect pack for you. I received 6 different scents, ranging from Cherry Pie to Olive Oil. The packaging wasn&#x27;t the greatest, as the bottles looked like they had been tossed into the box. Thankfully, none of my selection arrived broken or leaking, but I have a feeling that was luck more than anything else. The bottles are a bit larger than your average $1 a bottle liquid soap, although the price per bottle seems a bit higher too so it evens out. Cherry Pie and Mango were the definite hits in this household, while Olive Oil and Almond were definite nots. The soap itself cleans well and the scent isn&#x27;t too overpowering after you&#x27;ve rinsed your hands. The not testing on animals is a definite point in company&#x27;s favor and I&#x27;d consider buying the Cherry Pie and Mango versions alone. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d purchase this particular variety pack for our household as too many of the scents were blah or disliked.</li>
    <li> I generally hate the smell of handsoaps, but these are really nice. I would be hard pressed to even pick a favorite. The great thing is that not only is the smell pleasant, none are overpowering. They also do a good job on the cleaning side of things. Recommend.</li>
    <li> Beautiful pump containers full of six different fragrances, almond (sophisticated and subtle), blueberry parfait (sweet), cherry blossom (delightful), cherry pie (sweet smelling), mango ice cream (nice) and olive oil. The soap cleans well, the transparent bottles show off the bright colors. These are a lot of fun. I always like anything that I can use as leverage to get my kids to wash their hands, and these are terrific. One of those fun everyday things that you can enjoy inexpensively.</li>
    <li> This is a good variety of scented liquid soaps. All six scents were nice. The soap cleans well enough, but it doesn&#x27;t lather very much. If you&#x27;re used to foaming hand soaps, be advised this soap is thick and doesn&#x27;t foam. I only gave it 4 stars because of the low lathering factor.</li>
