      <li>Clairol Perfect 10 By Nice &#x27;N Easy Hair Color…</li>
      <li>Very pleased.</li>
      <li>its amazing....</li>
      <li>Oh and I have been doing my own hair for about 15 years</li>
      <li>Really nice color</li>
      <li>My mother liked how it turned out</li>
      <li>the conditioner smells nice - kind of coconutty -</li>
      <li>She decided she wanted to do her own instead of paying $80 at a salon each time.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely the best hair color out there.</li>
      <li>The color is rich and looks great.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love how my hair looks and feels!</li>
      <li>This would work great, but the first solution is already in the bottle that you use to treat the hair.</li>
      <li>I was sent only the Clairol Nice &amp;#34;N Easy Hair Color, not the Perfect 10.  </li>
      <li>It is better just to use the pointed tip that comes with the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The best part is the tube of Perfect 10 conditioner that comes in the box and gives enough conditioner to last about six weeks.  </li>
      <li>Love the color.</li>
      <li>Love, love this formula.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>Y hair more often.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s not to love???  </li>
      <li>i love Perfect 10 because it only takes 10 minutes!!  </li>
      <li>This my favorite color.  </li>
      <li>Perfect 10 ALWAYS makes my hair shine and the shine lasts until the next time I color it.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite hair dye.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff</li>
      <li>but I love the result</li>
      <li>The Halloween day-spray color is better than this junk.  </li>
      <li>Just to make sure you are not allergic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The color is rich and I love it!</li>
      <li>I am so glad I found this.</li>
      <li>I have been a hair stylist/colorist for many years.</li>
      <li>and I love the color.</li>
      <li>Did my research and read through most review here.</li>
      <li>Product has good results and is quick and easy.  </li>
      <li>Maybe my expectations are too high, but I was hoping for a great conditioner that would leave my hair silky and shiny after coloring.  </li>
      <li>To be honest this makes my hair super</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t until Clairol had a sale on their regular formulation of Nice and Easy - a sale so good that even though it was the kind you have to leave on for 25 mins</li>
      <li>I like the fact that in 10 minutes you have shiny, soft and great looking hair.</li>
      <li>Do yourself a favor and get another box color (even the really cheap colorsilk is WAY better).  </li>
      <li>When stores in my area quit carrying Perfect 10, I had to try other products.</li>
      <li>It is quick and easy!</li>
      <li>; Easy it was defective.</li>
      <li>Perfect 10 is fast, easy to use and not messy.  </li>
      <li>The color is excellent, with shine, covers grey (I am about 80%) and quick (I never use that comb the supply...</li>
      <li>Whatever I have to do to get this is fine with me.</li>
      <li>I had many choices but this one seemed to promise that my hair would be super shiny.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to use even for those whose dyeing their hair for the first time.</li>
      <li>I like the product perfect 10 due to the quick time it takes to dye your hair and the quality of the product.  </li>
      <li>I have been coloring my own hair for 30 years, but have mostly used professional grade products.  </li>
      <li>and I get two of them which is fantastic.</li>
      <li>To be fair, this could be my method of washing my hair, but I feel like I&#x27;ve been around the block enough with hair coloring to be able to judge a product satisfactorily.  </li>
      <li>I just dyed my virgin hair with natural red hues darker, with Clairol Perfect 10, and as I finished everything I realized something..</li>
      <li>A nice feature is that, once the product is all through your hair, you only have to leave it on for 10 (more) minutes.  </li>
      <li>My hair stays this beautiful dark auburn color for almost 3 months.</li>
      <li>I appreciated that the package came with two, but I was able to achieve my preferred color after one bottle.</li>
      <li>However, I find that even if I leave it on longer than that, it does not do a good job of covering gray or white hair.  </li>
      <li>Definitely Nice &#x27;N Easy as you only have to wait 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>will however say that this has a pretty strong ammonia scent so you may want to use it in a well ventilated room.</li>
      <li>This is by far one of the best color kits with a great long lasting color, easy to use and all in only 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>If you have gray hair, the extra 5 minutes seems to really help cover the gray roots more effectively.  </li>
      <li>Easy and fast to use.</li>
      <li>love this color and will continue to use it as long as it remains available!</li>
      <li>I like this one better than other ones because this is very quick and easy to apply when the pearls are darker.  </li>
      <li>It is a little more pricey, but buying it on Amazon makes it a great deal, and it is nowhere near salon prices for equivalent results.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Not a huge deal, but I don&#x27;t have that much hair.</li>
      <li>It works well and covered the gray but the chemical fumes burned my nose and eyes and made me run for fresh air.  </li>
      <li>Alternatively, they could have included one more bottle marked solution #1 (or #2 whatever).  </li>
      <li>It is conditioned and soft and in much better shape after the application than before.</li>
      <li>The price is right.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Did my research and read through most review here. Bought with confidence but only found myself end up with the same hair color. Maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work for me even though i did carefully follow the instruction.</li>
    <li> I like this one better than other ones because this is very quick and easy to apply when the pearls are darker.  other brands do not have that function and they are hard to make the solution stick to the hair on a first try.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I will continue to cover my greys with this product.  It is the only one I can find with a comb attachment for application!  My hair is always so soft it doesn&#x27;t look damaged from the treatment!</li>
    <li> This product turned my hair black! I was lucky enough that I am able to pull off black hair but I was very devistated at first. At first I thought maybe the bottles were switched inside I look online and lots of other people claim it did the same to them. I would never recommend this dye to anyone. Oh and I have been doing my own hair for about 15 years so I know this was not &#x27;user error&#x27;. I switch over to Feria and fixed it.</li>
    <li> Clairol Perfect 10 By Nice &#x27;N Easy Hair Color…&lt;br /&gt;Clairol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product, colors your hair very fast, and last.</li>
    <li> very easy to use, not messy, i have been using it for few years and never have a problem, highly recommend</li>
    <li> It works well and covered the gray but the chemical fumes burned my nose and eyes and made me run for fresh air.  It was the worst chemical/ammonia smell I&#x27;ve ever encountered while coloring my hair.</li>
    <li> Really nice color and it compliments my hair well. It&#x27;s also very easy to use even for those whose dyeing their hair for the first time.</li>
    <li> I gave this a try a few weeks ago to for the first time, to try to save money going to the salon every three weeks to cover my pesky grey hairs.  For my thick, wavy, dark brown hair, I used the 4 dark brown for the roots and then the 4G golden brown on the rest of my hair to give it a bit of dimension and avoid a harsh monotone look.  This strategy worked out well - the product covered the grey hairs and it came out looking natural, if a bit on the darker side.  The reason I&#x27;m giving it three stars and struggling with whether or not to continue with this product or try a new one is because of the conditioner provided in the package and the &amp;#34;flatness&amp;#34; of the color.  Maybe my expectations are too high, but I was hoping for a great conditioner that would leave my hair silky and shiny after coloring.  I did not have this experience...the conditioner smells nice - kind of coconutty - but kind of clung to my thick hair and didn&#x27;t detangle it.  When I washed it out, my hair felt like it had some residue on it.  To be fair, this could be my method of washing my hair, but I feel like I&#x27;ve been around the block enough with hair coloring to be able to judge a product satisfactorily.  While the color did cover the grey hairs, it looks a bit flat - kind of missing that conditioned, shiny look I was hoping to get.</li>
    <li> The color doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I ran to the grocery store to get a few things to cook and picked up this hair color while I was there. I had many choices but this one seemed to promise that my hair would be super shiny. So I colored my hair for Valentine&#x27;s day and it worked great. To be honest this makes my hair super shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will however say that this has a pretty strong ammonia scent so you may want to use it in a well ventilated room. At least leave the door open in the bathroom and put a fan on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dark Brown shade is very dark but still OK in the winter. I&#x27;d not use this color in the summer. Maybe I&#x27;ll buy a lighter shade next time. Use this with caution and do a skin allergy test before you use this for the first time. Just to make sure you are not allergic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This box contains two items you mix together for the color and one tube of conditioner to keep your hair shiny even longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would caution you about is using the applicator comb. I found that using it produced a real mess. It is better just to use the pointed tip that comes with the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this produces a high gloss finish and covers gray well. It really did work in 10 minutes. I was tired of my old hair color that took 30 minutes. So this really saved me a lot of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best hair color out there. I don&#x27;t understand why everyone doesn&#x27;t use it. Great ease, great coverage, great color and great price.</li>
    <li> My hair looks shiny and feels good but Dark Brown turned my hair Jet Black! My husband called me Elvira and laughed. Apparently, I&#x27;m not alone after reading a lot of reviews on various web sites. I&#x27;ve read the color will lighten after a few washes. I really hope so since I don&#x27;t want black hair.  I&#x27;ll go back to my usual brand in the future.</li>
    <li> This last my hair almost a blue / black color ...not my idea of a dark brown .</li>
    <li> I just dyed my virgin hair with natural red hues darker, with Clairol Perfect 10, and as I finished everything I realized something.. my hair was bone straight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little background about my hair; no chemicals and never been dyed. I do have 3a/3b hair, however even with my hair dripping wet - it was type 1; the only part of my hair that was curly was my bangs and some parts of my roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a wide tooth comb, still straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I blow dried it, with a diffuser, still straight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislike this product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair dye.  It really is only 10 minutes.  The color is rich and looks great.  My hair doesn&#x27;t get dried out and I love the conditioner it comes with.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time and have been completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Hair color works great. I really like the way it makes my hair feel after I die it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a huge deal, but I don&#x27;t have that much hair. Once the 2 active solutions are mixed, they basically have to be used right then. You cannot seal the container and save the remainder for later. This is clearly marked as a chemical hazard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alternative to this would be to only mix the amount that you need at the time. This would work great, but the first solution is already in the bottle that you use to treat the hair. Alternatively, they could have included one more bottle marked solution #1 (or #2 whatever).  This is a huge waste for me and my short hair. It&#x27;s a one shot deal regardless of how much hair a person has. There is no halfway, it&#x27;s all or nothing.  I use this on the move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose I could just buy my own bottle and then squirt the other active ingredient into it and just use the bottle for treatment, but they really should have thought of this themselves. Just a suggestion</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair look dry or feel dry even after a few weeks. This is the perfect shade for me and I love the color.</li>
    <li> I have been a hair stylist/colorist for many years. I have been using this product for several years. I was very sorry to no longer see it in the grocery stores, or at least not in the St. Louis, Phoenix or Florida. Thankfully, I can get it from Amazon! The color is excellent, with shine, covers grey (I am about 80%) and quick (I never use that comb the supply...it is useless). This color blends month after month.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that covers grey. I dont have alot but enough to be a pain in the but to cover, it is the only one that works and lasts the longest.</li>
    <li> Perfect 10 is fast, easy to use and not messy.  It gives good results and is worth the extra cost (a little more than other similar products)....not sure why this product is not longer carried in many retail stores...Very happy it&#x27;s avaiilable on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love, love this formula.  The color stays just as long as other brands/formulas but takes just 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> I have very long, very thick hair, thus it takes two boxes to do one coloring. However, it is worth it to have my hair look so natural and SHINY! Why can&#x27;t other hair colors leave your hair shining? Don&#x27;t know, but this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gray in my natural hair and this color wipes it out without a flaw. I wouldn&#x27;t color with anything else! Now that Walgreens and Walmart are not carrying it in their stores, I will order online. Whatever I have to do to get this is fine with me. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Perfect 10.</li>
    <li> The price is right.  But for the same product I by from the store, the color does not last as long.  I have to color. Y hair more often.</li>
    <li> Color is as expected and I have some very difficult gray to cover. Color lasts for me for 5-7 weeks.</li>
    <li> At first I thought it was me - that maybe my hair grows in fast and I&#x27;m doomed to have to dye my hair once a week. Because that&#x27;s what was happening with this product - Saturday would roll around again and the grays at my temples were so noticeable I was needing to dye my hair again. I knew it wasn&#x27;t getting washed out because I only wash my hair once every 5 to 7 days because my scalp tends to not be oily. I knew it wasn&#x27;t an application issue because on day 1 there were no grays at my temples, and I definitely left the color on longer than the prescribed time. It wasn&#x27;t until Clairol had a sale on their regular formulation of Nice and Easy - a sale so good that even though it was the kind you have to leave on for 25 mins I had to buy it -- that I knew the problem wasn&#x27;t me, it was Perfect 10. The other box was the same shade and it definitely lasted me weeks longer. I really wish Perfect 10 worked because I hate sitting around with color in longer than 10 minutes - but unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work (long enough) for me.</li>
    <li> This my favorite color.  Perfect 10 doesn&#x27;t tend to look brassy after being in the sun all day.  Easy to apply and not messy.  I like the fact that in 10 minutes you have shiny, soft and great looking hair.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found this. I barely have 10 minutes to color my hair. It colors well, does not fade like other brands and has reduced my frequency of coloring.</li>
    <li> I like the product perfect 10 due to the quick time it takes to dye your hair and the quality of the product.  However, I did not receive the Perfect 10 product that I ordered.  I was sent only the Clairol Nice &amp;#34;N Easy Hair Color, not the Perfect 10.  The results are not the same and it takes longer to dye the hair.  Was not satisfied with this product or  receiving the wrong product.</li>
    <li> I actually have never disliked a haircolor.  I dislike this one because although it may color for the first few days, it literally washes out.  Oh, if you have gray, don&#x27;t worry, it will still be there, just wait about 5 days.  Do yourself a favor and get another box color (even the really cheap colorsilk is WAY better).  The Halloween day-spray color is better than this junk.  Wish I could get a refund on this.</li>
    <li> I like it because i 10 min you will get the color</li>
    <li> The product that arrived was NOT Clairol Perfect 10.</li>
    <li> Product worked really well and I only needed one box even though my hair is thick.  When the package came one of the boxes was damaged so it was good thing I only needed one.  Good product but I just won&#x27;t buy it online anymore.  Too fragile to ship.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years. Best rich color.</li>
    <li> Don&amp;#34;t know why we can&#x27;t find this in stores, best at home hair color out there!</li>
    <li> i love Perfect 10 because it only takes 10 minutes!!  I don&#x27;t have patience to wait 30 minutes with other kind of hair color.  And you ge the same result!!  its amazing.... It&#x27;s the only hair color I use....  color last to me up to a month.....Wonderful product...</li>
    <li> I adore this product! I have been using it for 5 years and I find it to be the very best product. My hair stays this beautiful dark auburn color for almost 3 months. It is conditioned and soft and in much better shape after the application than before. It fades a bit after the first two washings, but when I color, I plan for this and let it darken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin--allergic to almost everything under the sun--nut this product does NOT affect my skin at all. It is one of the very few that doesn&#x27;t break me out in hives!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this color and will continue to use it as long as it remains available! Thank you for a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This was super easy to use, took 10 minutes, covered my grey.  What&#x27;s not to love???  Will definitely use again.</li>
    <li> I got the Dark Brown, and it came out black. I expected it to rinse and fade after a few shampoos, but several weeks later and it&#x27;s still extremely dark, only just starting to look brown instead of black in the sunlight. I&#x27;m disappointed, but this would be great if you wanted black hair. And I have to admit it didn&#x27;t fry my hair, it&#x27;s manageable, shiny and soft. Not at all dull. The color at least is vivid and lasting, if not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I used this for years but could no longer find it in stores. Thought they no longer made it. I was very disappointed but saw coupons for it. I then realised I could order online. Very excited to be able to get it again!!!</li>
    <li> Rich color covers the grey and works quickly what else do you need.  Love, love, love how my hair looks and feels!</li>
    <li> When stores in my area quit carrying Perfect 10, I had to try other products. They all made my hair look dull and dry. Perfect 10 ALWAYS makes my hair shine and the shine lasts until the next time I color it. I LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a subscription to this hair color as I can no longer find it in my local stores.  It&#x27;s convenient in that it only takes ten minutes to process and covers gray extremely well.  The best part is the tube of Perfect 10 conditioner that comes in the box and gives enough conditioner to last about six weeks.  The shine when this is used is truly outstanding, and I&#x27;d like to buy just the conditioner, but have only found it sold in the same size tube as enclosed with the color, and for about the same price as the whole color kit, so I keep buyng the color.  What I do not like is the actual color shade.  I want dark brown hair; not black; and this is more off-black even though they have a color called darkest brown, which I&#x27;d expect to be lighter than the color this comes out.  Over time the ends of my hair become nearly indistinguishable from black.  I&#x27;m changing to dark golden brown, hoping it will look more brown than black.  The convenience and the conditioner, which never fails to get compliments on my hair when it&#x27;s used, make it worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love the color. Although it looks black for about a week.</li>
    <li> Love this coloring can&#x27;t find it in my local stores and sometimes it is hard to find my color but I love the result</li>
    <li> it is perfect! I love this stuff but you can&#x27;t find it anywhere!  Order the 2 pack! I have been using this haircolor for years. It is quick and easy! Excellent gray coverage!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find this brand in the stores anymore so I order on line. It comes fast and I get two of them which is fantastic. It only sits on 10 minutes which is fantastic as some of them need 30-45 long minutes to work. The color is rich and I love it!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, typical home hair coloring method where you mix bottle 1 and tube 2, apply to hair, wait a while, rinse out, and then use tube 3 to condition your hair.  Comes with plastic disposable gloves, and a single tip cap and a comb-tip cap for the bottle, to use for either whole head or root application.  A nice feature is that, once the product is all through your hair, you only have to leave it on for 10 (more) minutes.  However, I find that even if I leave it on longer than that, it does not do a good job of covering gray or white hair.  My few white hairs are left initially a much lighter color than the product&#x27;s intended result, and then even that lighter color washes out in a few shampoos.  So, it seems pointless to use this. This is supposed to be a permanent color, resulting in dark brown hair, not a temporary golden brown color rinse.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best color kits with a great long lasting color, easy to use and all in only 10 minutes. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Easy and fast to use.</li>
    <li> One of the best and easiest to use</li>
    <li> On my last order of theClairol Perfect 10 Bye Nice &amp;amp; Easy it was defective. While preparing and mixing the toner and color my helper said it was getting hot in the bottle but as she was applying it to m hair it was burning my scalp.  She then noticed my scalp where the solution was put close to my scalp turned yellow.  I now have a yellow scalp with dark brown hair, which is totally unacssible,&lt;br /&gt;My daughter took some pictures which I will hav her send to me which I  intern will forward them to you.</li>
    <li> My wife has tried a few different hair color products and this one is her favorite.  She decided she wanted to do her own instead of paying $80 at a salon each time.  It is a little more pricey, but buying it on Amazon makes it a great deal, and it is nowhere near salon prices for equivalent results.  I have kept an eye on the price of the double packs through the Subscribe &amp; Save program and would stock up on extras when the price is right.  Good product and a good price through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Product has good results and is quick and easy.  Would definitely  recommend this product.  Have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Definitely Nice &#x27;N Easy as you only have to wait 10 minutes. I usually give it an extra 10 just to be sure all of the gray is covered. Works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t cover grays after reading the other reviews....but it covered mine. I&#x27;m 2 weeks in and it&#x27;s still working. I hate waiting 40 minutes with other brands. This is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I think this is clairols best hair dye. I did get the dark brown, I have dark brown hair and it went black so the next time I would use medium brown for dark brown hair. It colors great and stays longer.</li>
    <li> came promptly; works great!</li>
    <li> I had dyed my hair previously into a lighter brown color before using this product. However, after a few weeks, I wasn&#x27;t too keen with the idea of re-dying my roots so Plan B were to revert back to original color. For people wondering about accuracy of color in terms of what is portrayed on the box, I can vouch by saying that it&#x27;s pretty darn close. I appreciated that the package came with two, but I was able to achieve my preferred color after one bottle. My mother liked how it turned out so she asked if she could have the other package. Although she hasn&#x27;t used it yet, I&#x27;ll update on her input sooner or later...</li>
    <li> I have been coloring my own hair for 30 years, but have mostly used professional grade products.  Thought I would give this a try, and was very surprised at the ease, the time, the depth of color, and the coverage of grey.  Will definitely buy again.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have been using hair color for years, and one of the definite pluses of this product is the 10-15 minute wait time for the color to set.  If you have gray hair, the extra 5 minutes seems to really help cover the gray roots more effectively.  It doesn&#x27;t seem harsh at all and the conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft &amp; silky.  You do need to let the activator work for about 1-2 minutes before applying the color. Clairol definitely has a winner here!</li>
