      <li>The first one I bought was amazing, I don&#x27;t know if it had more of a certain ingredient if they are doctored or</li>
      <li>This product REALLY works!!!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
      <li>True to its name, it keeps my lashes looker longer &amp; fuller.  </li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly my eyelashes grew.</li>

      <li>and I feel as if it is a diluted version of the first.</li>
      <li>This stuff REALLY works!</li>
      <li>and I was not expecting it to work the way it did my lashes are longer and pretty.</li>
      <li>Just like the instructions said, after 6 weeks your eyelashes are so much longer!  </li>
      <li>I would recommend to anyone interested in this type of product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update on May 7, 2014: I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since I first bought it</li>
      <li>I was wrong, it has worked wonderfully for me.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says it is going to.  </li>
      <li>but my lashes are better than i ever expected</li>
      <li>this product woked very well for me the growth has  tapered off</li>
      <li>This really works for me.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is the real deal.</li>
      <li>I have never had much eyelashes to brag about, now I do.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure this tube will last me several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been 2 months now of religiously applying it during my normal makeup routine, and I&#x27;m here to tell you my lashes look fantastic.</li>
      <li>This is the only product that I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many, that actually works!</li>
      <li>After a lifetime of nearly non existent eyelashes, I could not be happier!</li>
      <li>This product gives me a good result: long and thick eye</li>
      <li>I have sensitive eyes, but this product has not irritated my eyes.</li>
      <li>It seems like the stuff is not working as well as it did the first couple of years,  my lashes aren&#x27;t getting as long.  </li>
      <li>I use far too much - my lashes are always mistaken for falsies, as of now they&#x27;re so long they almost reach my brows.  </li>
      <li>people ask me if I got lash extensions, and I apply to bottom lashes as well, and they really do look amazingly long.</li>
      <li>Stopped using it and color problem cleared up and eye lids back to normal color.</li>
      <li>I got it after reading some good reviews and deciding I would give a cheaper lash enhancer a chance since the bigger names are so dang expensive.</li>
      <li>They are longer, soft, curl up by themselves (but an eyelash curler really exaggerates it!), and they even seem a little darker.</li>
      <li>My lashes are thicker than ever and my only concern is that this product can burn your eyes a little when you first start using it.  </li>

<li> that any other so far.</li>
<li> only thing is my eyelids are a little red and sensitive when you rub them</li>
<li> I tried several other product stating the same benefits.</li>
<li> /&gt;The first few applications stung a little bit, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all anymore.  </li>
<li> long as extensions can be.  </li>
<li> My eyelashes have stayed long and luscious all this time.</li>
<li> My eyelashes are so long that they hit</li>
<li> ; long, not&lt;br</li>
<li> and my lashes are long.</li>
<li> but the lashes are very long .So</li>
<li> My problem is consistency, so I decided to put it on my eyelids in the morning before makeup, let it dry and apply my makeup.</li>
<li> Not only that,  when I start using it after not using it for a month or 2, I will lose lashes maybe 1 or 2 daily for a few weeks.</li>
<li> After six weeks I noticed that my lashes were full, longer, and no more bald spots!!!!!!</li>
<li> , my experience is that I have extreme dry eye.  </li>
<li> I use less mascara because now a little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I just purchased this for the second time over the past year and a half.</li>
<li> My eyes got swollen and hard to keep them open.</li>
<li> being that it costs less.  </li>
<li> This one had a reversed reaction to what the first one actually created and I was so disappointed.  </li>
<li> Or if anyone else noticed that it&#x27;s  not working as well after using it for a few years...?</li>
<li> so I&#x27;ve been using the stuff for about 3 years now except for a few months here and there.  </li>
<li> I quit using this product to see if that helped with the dry eye, and after a couple days I no longer had to use the fake tears.</li>
<li> Disappointed it d id not work for me, I had big hopes for this product, however it did not irritate my eyes.</li>
<li> I notice an increase in brown pigmentation in the base of upper eyelashes and my eye bag gets darker</li>
<li> /&gt;Given how thin and sparse my lashes were, I believe I will use this product forever!&lt;br</li>
<li> I had straight, pathetic, sparse lashes before that gapped in places from lashes falling out.</li>
<li> , am I wearing false eyelashes, etc.&lt;br</li>
<li> I was sick and tired or used a dark eye shadow.</li>
<li> I hope I am wrong.</li>
<li> /&gt;However, I gave one to my friend for using, unfortunately my friend&#x27;s eyelid was allergic to the product.</li>
<li> but it was just too expensive.</li>
<li> I used it according to the directions, and I was very disappointed with the results, which were no results, except, that my eyelids looked a little darker.  </li>

    <li> I discovered Nutraluxe on airline duty free.  It&#x27;s well worth the price.  Results show within a matter of days.  I use far too much - my lashes are always mistaken for falsies, as of now they&#x27;re so long they almost reach my brows.  I&#x27;ll make sure to never run out of this miracle worker.</li>
    <li> Used this product for several months and LOVE it!  It truly works. Have recommended to several people and they all love it</li>
    <li> This product gives me a good result: long and thick eye lash.&lt;br /&gt;Before, I used a similar product: Revitalash conditioner, that gave a slower result.&lt;br /&gt;However, I gave one to my friend for using, unfortunately my friend&#x27;s eyelid was allergic to the product. Her eyelid turned red after using it.&lt;br /&gt;Please give me an advice in this case.&lt;br /&gt;Users always expect good result and safe.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Easy to apply, no muss/fuss and you do see results within 2-3 mths,&lt;br /&gt;sometimes sooner.  Wherever I go people ask me if I got lash extensions, and I apply to bottom lashes as well, and they really do look amazingly long. And a &amp;#34;natual&amp;#34; long, not&lt;br /&gt;as long as extensions can be.  This Nutraluxe MD lengthens, thickens and in some cases darkens the hair.  Haven&#x27;t tinted my lashes or worn mascara in months - no need.&lt;br /&gt;My experience was within 2 mths I definitely saw the thicker,longer lashes.  Used it nitely for 3 mths straight and realized how good it would get and now use it as maintnance every other nite.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
    <li> True to its name, it keeps my lashes looker longer &amp; fuller.  I&#x27;ve bought this product for 2 years and is a must to my beauty regime.</li>
    <li> I tried several other product stating the same benefits. This one works for me better that any other so far.</li>
    <li> My lashes got very long and beautiful. this product woked very well for me the growth has  tapered off but my lashes are better than i ever expected</li>
    <li> I used to use a different eyelash treatment that worked beautifully but it was just too expensive. When I started searching my options I was concerned that this product would not work as well being that it costs less.  I was wrong, it has worked wonderfully for me. I am very happy with it and actually I am planning to put in another order for it!</li>
    <li> This is the only product that I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many, that actually works! It took a few weeks of diligently applying every night, but before I knew it, people were talking about my lashes and some even thought they were fake lashes (in a good way). I will never stop using it!</li>
    <li> After two months of use my lashes did show length and fullness but eye lids turned a horrible sore color. Looked liked I was sick and tired or used a dark eye shadow. Stopped using it and color problem cleared up and eye lids back to normal color.</li>
    <li> This really works for me.  I thought that I was never going to get my eyelashes back - this did the trick for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this by accident and was going to return but a the last minute I decided to keep it and I was not expecting it to work the way it did my lashes are longer and pretty.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference.  I used it according to the directions, and I was very disappointed with the results, which were no results, except, that my eyelids looked a little darker.  I didn&#x27;t like that.  They seem to have lightened up some now.</li>
    <li> My lashes are thicker than ever and my only concern is that this product can burn your eyes a little when you first start using it.  You will see  results within about 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. Definatly notice differance in eyelash length! Would buy this again with no hesitation. Love it.</li>
    <li> I requested refund to this company as I had severe reaction  from this conditioner. My eyes and face got red and itch. My eyes got swollen and hard to keep them open. I got scared and washed with soap but this symptom lasted for more than 12 hours. I received a reply  &amp;#34;unfortunately used personal care items are not refundable&amp;#34; by email as simple as that.  I wish Amazon has better selection of whom they are dealing with.&lt;br /&gt;Since all sales are thru mailing system Refund policy should be more favorable for the consummers.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and the area around my eyes became all red. I tried to return it but was told I couldn.t  I never saw a policy on Amazon saying I couldn&#x27;t return it.  Trust me, go to a better more reliable distributor. Now I&amp;#34;m stuck with a product I can&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a while and my lashes are long.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly my eyelashes grew. I applied it more than just once a day and had amazing results in no time at all!</li>
    <li> It took about 5 weeks of nightly application for this to kick in.  But now people are commenting on my eyelashes, asking me what mascara I use, am I wearing false eyelashes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given how thin and sparse my lashes were, I believe I will use this product forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few applications stung a little bit, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all anymore.  After a lifetime of nearly non existent eyelashes, I could not be happier!</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it says it is going to.  My eyelashes are so long that they hit&lt;br /&gt;the lenses of my sunglasses.</li>
    <li> This is great for promoting growth.  I went from sparse eyelashes to someone actually complimenting me on my eye lashes. Unlike prescriptions, over the counter products do not list possible side effects.  Others have mentioned redness, rash, etc., my experience is that I have extreme dry eye.  I had to  buy and start using lubricant eye drops and gel for relief.  I quit using this product to see if that helped with the dry eye, and after a couple days I no longer had to use the fake tears.</li>
    <li> Disappointed it d id not work for me, I had big hopes for this product, however it did not irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this for the second time over the past year and a half. This product is remarkable!!  I would give it 10 stars if I could. This product REALLY works!!!</li>
    <li> Works great!  Love it!  Just like the instructions said, after 6 weeks your eyelashes are so much longer!  I have sensitive eyes, but this product has not irritated my eyes.</li>
    <li> It truly works! I have longer, stronger lashes. Before I used this product my lashes would easily fall out so I would always have bald spots that took forever to grow in. Once the lashes did grow in they would fall out once again. It was a vicious cycle. A friend recommended this product and I am so glad she did! After six weeks I noticed that my lashes were full, longer, and no more bald spots!!!!!! The results don&#x27;t happen over night so don&#x27;t give up once you begin using this product.</li>
    <li> Very effective, it really make a difference after applying it. My wife followed the instruction and found her eyelash grew longer and better !</li>
    <li> i liked it very much .works just as it says .the only thing is my eyelids are a little red and sensitive when you rub them but the lashes are very long .So i will continue to use it ..</li>
    <li> I would recommend to anyone interested in this type of product. There was a noticeable difference within a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a month and I put it every night, no lengthening happen. I notice an increase in brown pigmentation in the base of upper eyelashes and my eye bag gets darker</li>
    <li> This stuff is the real deal. I&#x27;ve tried SmartLash, RapidLash, Latisse, you name it. This stuff is the best. I got it after reading some good reviews and deciding I would give a cheaper lash enhancer a chance since the bigger names are so dang expensive. My problem is consistency, so I decided to put it on my eyelids in the morning before makeup, let it dry and apply my makeup. I honestly didn&#x27;t have a lot of confidence. It&#x27;s been 2 months now of religiously applying it during my normal makeup routine, and I&#x27;m here to tell you my lashes look fantastic. I had straight, pathetic, sparse lashes before that gapped in places from lashes falling out. Not anymore! They are longer, soft, curl up by themselves (but an eyelash curler really exaggerates it!), and they even seem a little darker. The gaps are gone, and they&#x27;ve filled out nicely. I use less mascara because now a little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, this one takes time to work, but a great buy and I&#x27;m pretty sure this tube will last me several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on May 7, 2014: I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since I first bought it and it&#x27;s still wowing me every day! My eyelashes have stayed long and luscious all this time. Consistency is key. Keep using it every day and you&#x27;ll keep your great lashes. Good luck!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the very same product but it worked a lot differently. I think some of these might be knock-offs. The first one I bought was amazing, I don&#x27;t know if it had more of a certain ingredient if they are doctored or what. This one had a reversed reaction to what the first one actually created and I was so disappointed.  I&#x27;m still trying to get back what I had.</li>
    <li> Fuzzy hair grew un my lower lid!&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of an side effect...</li>
    <li> Absolutely FABULOUS! After 3 weeks I am seeing noticeably thicker, longer lashes.</li>
    <li> My lashes have grown longer and thicker since I&#x27;ve been using this.  It&#x27;s also helped my sparse brows grow some!</li>
    <li> This came with no instructions so I wasn&#x27;t sure how often to use it or if I should wear it under makeup.</li>
    <li> Wife saw increase on 3 weeks</li>
    <li> This stuff REALLY works! I almost don&#x27;t want to tell anyone. I have never had much eyelashes to brag about, now I do. People ask me if I&#x27;m wearing fake eyelashes! I will never stop using this stuff!  Update:  so I&#x27;ve been using the stuff for about 3 years now except for a few months here and there.  It seems like the stuff is not working as well as it did the first couple of years,  my lashes aren&#x27;t getting as long.  Not only that,  when I start using it after not using it for a month or 2, I will lose lashes maybe 1 or 2 daily for a few weeks. At some point the stuff kicks in and they start growing and getting thicker... I&#x27;m just wondering if anyone else is having this issue? Or if anyone else noticed that it&#x27;s  not working as well after using it for a few years...?</li>
    <li> This is the second tube I am using and I feel as if it is a diluted version of the first. I hope I am wrong. Time will tell.</li>
