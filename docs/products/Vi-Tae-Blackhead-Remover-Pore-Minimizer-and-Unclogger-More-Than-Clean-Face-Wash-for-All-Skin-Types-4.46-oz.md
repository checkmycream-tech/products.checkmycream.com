<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this makes your skin so soft and it really works</li>
    <li> Awesome and fantastic product!  Love it!  This product worked really fast on removing my blackheads and minimizing pores.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Genetically, I have large pores on my nose and when I use it in the morning as directed, it cleans well and reduces size. Only works on the days I use it though and doesn&#x27;t seem to make any difference long term, only day to day.</li>
    <li> When I first tried it for a few days, I got some flaking on my skin.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was due to this product or my skin was drying or allergic for some other reason.  So i stopped using for 2 weeks and forgot about it.  Then recently I started trying it again and after a few days, I got some flaking on my skin again.  So I am pretty sure it&#x27;s this product.  Maybe the flaking is due to the exfoliating action? I have no idea, but the flaking skin is making it very hard to put makeup on since makeup make the flaking more obvious.  So I tried to return the product only to have find out that it is past the return window and I am stuck with bottle of this that I paid $40 for and can&#x27;t use it.  My blackheads didn&#x27;t diminish nor did my pore shrink.  It just had no effect except causing flaking of my skin.</li>
    <li> I used this product for about a month and didn&#x27;t notice any improvement with my pores. It didn&#x27;t shrink them or do anything. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> It seems to be working</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of money on beauty products and cosmetics. So $40 was pretty pricey for me. I ended up taking a leap of faith on this product and I could not be any happier. I saw results after the first use. I recently started using this before using one of those nose strips. They work great together.</li>
    <li> I only used this product about two times a week and it really did reduce my pore size on my nose and cheeks where I had the most problems. My pores are still smaller even though I have not been using this product as much so I would really recommend it to someone with severe black head issues since it did so well for me.</li>
    <li> I just started using and can&#x27;t believe the different.</li>
    <li> After patting my face with water in the morning I massage this product on my face and leave it on while brushing my teeth. It leaves a tingling sensation in my face that I love. I noticed that after about a few days my skin is smoother, tightness in my face and the smoothness around my nose area which are full of blackheads. Overall I will continue to use it to better my results, I am loving it so far!</li>
    <li> I like this product because of the mintyness of the cream, but didn&#x27;t see much improvement in my pores after following directions for several weeks</li>
    <li> Is working great for the past 2 weeks I ready can see improvement 👍👍👍👍</li>
    <li> Used this for a week and love the way it makes my face feel afterwards.</li>
    <li> My wife love it.  She uses it everyday and got a very good results with it</li>
    <li> Wow!!  I am so glad that I found this product on Amazon.  I followed the instructions and I use this every morning and leave on my skin for 2-3 minutes before rinsing.  The glowing effects were immediate.  But..what amazed me even more..is that a stubborn sun spot on my cheek that I have had for more than 40 years is fading.  I did not even think it was possible.  For that reason alone, I am awarding five stars.  But, just feel your skin afterwards--it feels amazing!! Like my skin of 20 years ago.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Great Seller!</li>
    <li> Works better than anything else I have tried (which admittedly is not a LOT).</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait at least 3 weeks after purchasing this before I reviewed the product.  There has been zero improvement in the blackheads.  I have carefully followed the instructions for 3 weeks.  I still give it 3 stars because it does a good job of overall cleaning, just nothing for blackheads.</li>
    <li> Five stars if they turn the bottle into a jar.</li>
    <li> I discovered Vitae skin care products about a month ago and I must confess I&#x27;m in LOVE with this brand. I&#x27;m an Asian-American woman in my mid 30s and I have sensitive, combination skin with large pores (thanks a bunch mom!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First,  I must point out that &amp;#34;More Than Clean&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all. It does just what it says and leaves my skin feeling very clean, while also shrinking my pores. What&#x27;s amazing to me is that most pore minimizing products would have cost me double and triple the cost of &amp;#34;More Than Clean&amp;#34; in the past. So not only am I fixing my skin problems, but I&#x27;m also saving money too - double win! It&#x27;s also wonderfully good at removing excess makeup and balancing my combo skin. I&#x27;m giving this cleanser 5 stars all around. I also love that it&#x27;s completely natural, made with herbs, and plants that are healthier for your skin.  Hope this helps!  I bet you love it as much as I do!!</li>
    <li> I like this product i used it now and it helps my white heads and black heads remove, beuatiful face cleansing a good package i get this product discounted.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. And it&#x27;s only been one use. It definitely clean up the pores and reduced them about 10-20%. I&#x27;ll have to come back to update after a week or so. I plan on using every other day b/c I&#x27;m afraid my nose, which tends to be oily, will get even oilier.</li>
    <li> This product has worked wonders for my daughter&#x27;s blemishes.  We have purchased the facial scrub Get Refreshed and this More Than Clean to be used together. We have tried countless products including Proactive to help with her non-inflammatory clogged pores.  These stubborn bumps on her forehead were difficult to clear and continuously resurfacing.  This is the first product that has not only cleared her skin but prevents new blemishes. Although a little pricey, the first order lasted 3 months with once daily use.  I highly recommend these cleansers.  This is a quality product which has actually delivered on what so many other products had previously failed to.  We are sold.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing to my blackheads. I have a combination skin, with blackheads only on my nose and some on my chin. I have been using this product as directed for more than a week now and I do not see any difference in the appearance of my blackheads. Will still keep using it until I finish the bottle hoping that it will work eventually, but looks like I am not going to buy another bottle of this useless product.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great I use it every morning and sometimes at night, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry. Another great thing about this product is that after I use it in the morning I feel awake.</li>
    <li> I love this!!! I&#x27;ve been looking for a remover to help me unclog my pores for so long. I&#x27;ve done everything to unclog my pores since they started to appear in my late 20s. I&#x27;ve even tried laser treatments. But this!! This is amazing. I can&#x27;t believe how clean my pores have gotten.  Follow directions and you&#x27;ll see results. You&#x27;ll see better results if you do the following: 1. Turn on the shower 2. Follow directions and massage product onto face for 1 to 2 minutes 3. Jump in the shower 4. Leave product on for 2 to 3 minutes 5. Wipe off  This is an amazing product.  I only ask of Vi Tae is to stick with this formula and don&#x27;t try to &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; it.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with Vi-Tae. It works great.</li>
    <li> I am 30 ,  and have oily skin with large pores.  After using Vi-tae for 2 weeks now,  my skin got much smoother and cleaner,  with visibly smaller pores.  I&#x27;m excited!  Love the tingly sensation on my skin when leaving the product on for 2 minutes -  so refreshing.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I use it every morning.  Definitely can see an improvement in my skin after one week of using.  My skin is so much smoother.  Fast shipping and packaged really well. Will buy this again.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells fantastic and is so easy to use!  I love that it gives my skin a matte finish but I wish I could leave it on all day.  I used this too much when I first got it and I&#x27;m waiting on my skin to calm down - my error, not a reflection of the product.  After one use I noticed an incredible difference in my pores - they were cleaner and smaller - I think that&#x27;s why I used it too much - it was very exciting to see a difference.  All the reviews are right - this stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> My sons nose was terrible with blackheads before we got this product. I yell all the time about him not washing his face. This isn&#x27;t a girls smell, but its not soap either. We are seeing fewer blackheads after only a couple of weeks. Just in time because I was about to squeeze them all out! GROSS!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t do much on the face. But the feeling of rubbing it on my face was good.</li>
    <li> Really feels awesome on my skin, my blackheads have diminished slightly but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a complete and drastic difference. I&#x27;m sure with the aid of pore strips along with this product, my blackheads may disappear! If anything, this product makes your face feel so refreshed and clean and it has an amazing smell and cool feel on the skin as well. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Got a great deal on this product! Tried it out and LOVED IT! Did exactly what it says! Blackheads GONE in 3 minutes!</li>
    <li> Seems to be really great at cleaning out the pores. I use this after my shower when the face is still damp and the skin is warmed up.&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using this product for about a week now and i have noticed that the pores on my nose and upper cheeks, and forehead have all decreased in size. i&#x27;m hoping to see even better results after i get past 2+ weeks.&lt;br /&gt;This product has a decent scent and even though the bottle might seem small, you don&#x27;t have to use that much at a time for it to be effective. Probably the best pore cleaner that is natural based i have ever used. Like alot of people i went through various other products first, all of the regular top ones, Nutregena, clean &amp; clear, Biore..etc Those all have alot of synthetic chemicals and are not nearly as effective as this!</li>
    <li> Seems to help with pore size, but regular acne seems aggrivated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now. The product works great cleaning the blackheads. It cleans thoroughly without irritating the skin. I am still waiting to see the pores minimizing effect though.</li>
    <li> Works well. I see some results. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now. I am prone to cystic acne and with this product my acne is way less severe. My pores are also smaller. Did not give 5 stars because of the price.</li>
    <li> The scent to this face wash is very strong and minty. However, this product is amazing and works wonderful. I have been using it on my nose mostly because that is my problem area for blackheads. The consistency of the wash is thick and has a little bit of granules. the bottle looks small but it is completely full and for the amount that you use it will last a good while. I have noticed a huge difference on my nose and will continue to use this. I did receive it a discounted price to review.</li>
    <li> Smelled fine and, sure, my face felt clean. Didn&#x27;t remove my blackheads after I used it daily until I ran out. Will try something different next. Not worth the price for me.</li>
    <li> Great for me and my dog (Chinese crested).</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a few days, but my skin feels great! It has a nice tingling feeling when you massage it in. Use it with a Clarasonic brush! I will keep buying this product!! The customer service from this company is phenomenal! They actually check up on you! GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> Its been 3 days since i started using this awesome product and can really see the difference, my pores are more cleaned, less blackheads. Its really working. Loving this product.</li>
    <li> I am in love with these products, I have acne, oily and dry skin in different areas of my face. I started with the scrub then the cleanser and now the product for black heads and all work beautifully, my skin loves them!!!</li>
    <li> I love it!!!!!  Outstanding product!  Really works.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase from this brand I&#x27;m really loving it.  The scent reminds me of something they use at a nice spa it&#x27;s calming and relaxing.  The bottle is a nice size and has tons of product in it.  The formula is lovely and I noticed a difference in my face after one use. I will be getting more of this stuff.   I got this free already discounted price for my unbiased feedback</li>
    <li> i love it, n do remember to shake it before usage.</li>
    <li> This product definitely does what it claims - minimizes and unclogs pores.  I&#x27;m an outdoorsy girl, I love camping and riding dirtbikes/quads, so as you can imagine my pores have always been difficult to keep clean.  It took a good 1-2 weeks of using this product daily before I really noticed the difference, but now I can honestly say my skin has never felt so smooth and soft and my pores don&#x27;t look nearly as huge as they used to (in my opinion).  I was hoping this product would help a bit more with breakouts, which I still get breakouts here and there, and its a bit pricy for the amount, hence the 4-stars.  But if you want smoother, cleaner looking skin, this is definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> Great tingling sensation! It doesn&#x27;t remove all my blackheads but you can really feel it refresh you skin!</li>
    <li> This product did not get rid of blackheads or minimize pores.  I used it for 2 weeks and nothing.  Yes nice and clean.  But it is being advertised as a blackhead remover and pore minimizer.  I&#x27;m a little pissed that it didnt&#x27; work as advertised.  I&#x27;m thinking this product has been filled with a bunch of fake reviews in order for sales.</li>
    <li> This is a good product to reduce blackheads. It will never permanently get rid of them but my skin does look improved. If you are like me and suffer from adult acne or any acne really, you will notice some flair ups. You have to decide which is more annoying, blackheads or some acne. It also shrinks and tights your pores but don&#x27;t expect a miracle here. I would recommend this. I plan on buying more. It&#x27;s expensive for how much you get but I only use a little everyday. That&#x27;s why I gave it 3 instead of 5 stars.  Update: I am now on my 3rd bottle of this product. They changed some of the ingredients, in this bottle. not sure why. It doesn&#x27;t work as well and my skin is breaking out. Please go back to the original formula. It worked so much better and I had less breakouts.</li>
    <li> This is truly a great product! I noticed pore size reduction in 2 days! It makes your face feel super duper clean and it basically got rid of all of my blackheads. Also I am experiencing a side effect some other customers have as well. The mint type feeling opens up my sinuses and gets me moving in the morning! Really good stuff!</li>
    <li> This makes my face feel refreshed and clean. I started off using another foaming wash before using this one because I wasn&#x27;t sure that this would get all the dirt off since it doesn&#x27;t get soapy. Then one day I was left without any foam face wash and I just used this one. My face felt clean and ever since I&#x27;ve been using it my pores do seem like they are less noticeable. I love the tingling feeling this gives me on my skin. I usually wet my face with warm water then massage the cleanser on my face and leave it on for a minute or two then wash it off with cold water. I&#x27;m honestly not sure I would actually pay as much as they&#x27;re selling it for, but the product works very well. It&#x27;s even helped me keep blemishes at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> For those of us with stubborn little blackheads, this product is a must.  It feels great on my face and those blackheads just come out.  I don&#x27;t think I could function without it, now that I have found it.  Nothing I have tried works this well or feels so good.  A must  for anyone with a blackhead problem.  This is the best!!!</li>
    <li> Have only used once so far but it was fabulous!  The product was green, which surprised me but it didn&#x27;t smell and felt nice on my skin!</li>
    <li> This product did and excellent job of loosening blackheads.  Then we just pulled them out.  Sorry for the graphic.  I would suggest trying this.  It&#x27;s not harsh and really helped make it an easy and painless process.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser, just smells a little funny</li>
    <li> Love this.product.and.co</li>
    <li> works but not as quickly as it was claimed. It does show clearing of blackheads.</li>
    <li> Its pricey but it DOES work well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 50 with menopause ravaged skin. I&#x27;ve been plagued by huge pores and blackheads on my nose ever since I was a child. I&#x27;ve tried everthing...honestly everything with no results..until now. This product is my new BFF. It is so wonderful to wash my face..use the &amp;#34;Better Than Clean&amp;#34; and then look in my magnifyer mirror and see CLEAR skin! ♡ this stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my face feel so refreshed. It&#x27;s what I look forward to firt and last thing of everyday!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vi-tae &#x27;More Than Clean&#x27; for about two weeks. I&#x27;m a 56 year old man. My pores are definitely cleaner. They may be closing or shrinking in size, also. That, however, my be the from the general drying and tightening affect this has on skin. A few more weeks will tell for sure. I&#x27;m hoping it reduces pore size permanently. That would be nice. My nose definitely looks better than before I started using this.  I like the product. It has a nice aroma. It is warm on my skin. It rinses well.  I use it twice a day. My routine is to 1) wash with my traditional facial cleanser, 2) gently rub &#x27;More than Clean&#x27; on the affected area (my nose) for a minute or so, 3) dab a bit more on as a sort of facial mask, 4) let it sit there for 2-3 minutes while I brush teeth and such, 5) Gently rub a bit more and 6) Rinse.  I tried adding straight aloe vera gel but it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out enough to merit that.  The company is quite nice and has followed-up with a couple of emails. I&#x27;d continue using this long-term. I like it!</li>
    <li> Smells great, very herbal like scent. Cleans the skin/pores ok but leaves face cloth dinge even after washing. Cleaner did minimize my pores and i like that very much. IT did not remove all my blackheads after using for one week. but i feel the bottle is over priced $40/bottle.</li>
    <li> Im not sure if it works on the blakheads because its so harsh onthe skin. Very stron if u have sensitive skin u definately better try something else</li>
    <li> Took 3 days, but the pores on my nose appear smaller. Product also has a pleasant scent. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This really works on the nose where I had problems. Be careful if you use all over your face.  Minimum dryness. Might need to use oil free moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This item is ok but was way too expensive for what it is!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for well over a year.  I only use it once a day and my blackhead pores are smaller but it does not rid blackheads.  There is still material in the pores, so don&#x27;t expect a miracle.  The one thing I can add is this product can cause some serious inflammation to skin that does not need to be treated.  I always get a little overlap on my cheeks and under my eyes and try to wash it off right away, but if this is left on for the five minutes in application and wait time, my skin almost blistered and it took months to get the skin area close to my eye back to normal.  Just a heads-up.  You may not have this problem but it is definitely a problem for me.  I apply this product now with a Q-Tip and am extremely careful that I don&#x27;t touch areas of my skin that do not need this product.  I&#x27;m pretty hyperconscious about it now.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often write reviews, but this product really surprised me, even after one application!  Pores definitely clearer and tighter.  Full disclosure:  I had purchased a Clarisonic facial brush system, and used the latter the night before.  This product is used in the morning.  I certainly think that the combo makes it even more effective.  Impressive product.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Smells wonderful, between the smell and cold water it really makes you feel rejuvenated! On top of it my skin is so soft!</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to trying this product.  When I opened it and squeezed some out, I though, &amp;#34;Ewww.&amp;#34;  It is a green color, that is like split pea soup.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what I received.  I went ahead and used it as directed, and I was so impressed.  I love the way it made my face feel.  It has a fresh smell, and has a cooling effect, while on the skin.  After rinsing, and before using my serums, my face felt very taught and firm.  I&#x27;m looking forward to continuing to use this.</li>
    <li> I feel like my pores are really smaller and it works well with my make up👍👍👍👍👍</li>
    <li> Bought for Granddaughter.  She is very excited to have this product. Perfect!</li>
    <li> I have literally NEVER reviewed any product before, but this one truly blew me away. I have been trying for about 2 years to get rid of the blackheads and minimize my pores on my nose, but I couldn&#x27;t find anything that worked. I have been using this product for only 4 days, and I already see better results than those from any other product I&#x27;ve used! My pores are noticeably unclogged and smaller (my boyfriend could even tell they were smaller), and the little bumps I used to have on the sides of my nose are completely gone! As some other reviewers have said, it does dry out my skin a bit. But it&#x27;s easy enough to fix with lotion, and I honestly don&#x27;t mind such a minor side effect while getting such fantastic results. It smells wonderful and does what it&#x27;s claimed to do. I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> this is great, awesome product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week now. Only see a little difference in my blackheads, perhaps it will take longer, but I will say that my skin overall feels and looks very clean without drying. Its my nose area that has a blackhead concentration, and while they have faded, they are not as &amp;#34;gone&amp;#34; as I had hoped.  I will continue to use and hope that the blackheads and pores continue to diminish.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin very soft but i still have the black heads 😪</li>
    <li> After much research, I decided to buy this product. Started using it 6 months ago. It will be a staple in my facial routine forever! It is gentle, but it offers deep cleansing. Make sure you let it dry on your face. It also has a mini peel effect. It really works for keeping blackheads under control.</li>
    <li> Definitely did not see results after one use and it burned my face a little every couple of times. I dont really think this product is worth $40. I have sensitive skin and only use this once a day.  Update 8/1/15: I take back my last review because I have noticed my pores have become smaller and my blackheads are starting to get smaller. Give it time and your blackheads will shrink. I only use it once a day because I feel the effectiveness of the cleanser is to much for more than once a day.  Update 7/13/2016: I bought a second bottle of this product and I noticed the formula has changed. With the new formula, I have noticed no change and will not be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> It dried my skin out too much.</li>
    <li> Works to reduce and clean pores. Love it!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical buying this because I have very sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and i use it 2 times a week. So far it works as advertised. I will purchase more once this bottle is gone.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;Only one bad part is somewhat difficult to use it every morning, takes some time. But effect worth it</li>
    <li> I used this for awhile before writing my review. I am in my 50&#x27;s and this facial cleanser works great on my skin. I love using it in the morning. It is so appropriately named... it makes my skin feel very clean, more so than other cleansers I have tried. It really has noticeably helped reduce and tighten my pores. And it hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin. I like the consistency. Very happy with this cleanser!</li>
    <li> Using every other days. Pore looks much smaller now. Reduced pimples too.</li>
    <li> I read all the glowing reviews and decided to purchase this product, and decided to use it daily for a month before writing this review.  If you are considering purchasing this product be advised that Vi-Tae will send you emails encouraging you to post a review (hence, this one for my purchase -- but not the positive rating they were soliciting), and offer you incentives for good reviews -- Amazon promo codes for discounts on other Vi-Tae products.  I did not go to their website to fill out the form to get discounts, nor did I register for their $250 sweepstakes.  The name of this product is &amp;#34;More Than Clean:  Blackhead Remover, Pore Minimizer &amp; Unclogger;&amp;#34; It is a misnomer to call it a &amp;#34;blackhead remover&amp;#34; since it does not remove blackheads; I doubt there is a product out there that does.  Perhaps it does minimize and unclog pores, but I am rating it two-stars for two reasons:  (1) because of the &amp;#34;blackhead remover&amp;#34; claim, which was the reason for my purchase; and (2) the Amazon price of the product, 4.46 oz for $39.95 (list price $69.50).</li>
    <li> I had to wait over a month before writing my review so I could give an honest and accurate review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month I was disappointed. My blackheads were a little less noticeable, but far from gone or even any hope they would be gone eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 6 weeks I started to notice a huge difference! Keep in mind I forgot to use it a few times or felt my face was too dry and gave it a break for a day. My blackheads are extremely diminished and almost 1/2 are gone! When my nose started to get flaky dead skin, such as what happens after you pop a zit, I knew this product was working just as the reviews had said! I&#x27;ve got more to go and I know I&#x27;ll get there with continued use of this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really does work!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will answer any questions anyone may have! Remember, the blackheads will not go away immediately BUT eventually YES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I used this product at night instead of the morning! It seemed to make more sense to use it at night while my face wouldn&#x27;t have makeup on it for about 9 hours.</li>
    <li> my face feel clean and look clean..i like it</li>
    <li> Excellent product from day 1!  This easy to use facial product is not only easy to use, but super effective.  I have seen a huge impact in the amount and area of blackheads.  I would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> More Than Clean is a combination scrub and masque recommended for morning use.  You work it into your skin for a couple of minutes, then leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing it off.  There are no unpronounceable ingredients in it, and it smells like peppermint.  It&#x27;s a very thick bilious colored liquid dispensed through the bottle cap.  I&#x27;ve used it four times with great results on my skin and one unexpected but welcome side effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MTC initially feels like mud, but there&#x27;s a really refreshing tingle that&#x27;s just great first thing in the morning.  If you&#x27;re of the generation that used a product called Seabreeze, that&#x27;s exactly the sensation, only stronger.  The tingle doesn&#x27;t go away until the stuff is rinsed off, either, and skin feels really clean.  I have some large pores around my nose, and they&#x27;re thoroughly flattened by&lt;br /&gt;this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry skin, go easy with this, and use a good moisturizer afterwards.  I have an oily T Zone with dry cheeks, and have learned to concentrate on my oily areas with the MTC, with just a quick once over on the dryer areas of my face.  I&#x27;ve been using this just before showering in the morning, and then using the shower to rinse it off--and here&#x27;s the unexpected side effect: my miserable early spring sinuses have improved!  I think it&#x27;s the herbs in the product coupled with the steam from the shower, but my whole sinus area feels SO much more open.  Hooray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled with this product.  My skin feels awake and energized, and the products I use daily--serums, moisturizer, and BB cream--just sink right in after use.  I was provided a bottle of More Than Clean for review, and am delighted to do so.  I really like the effect on my skin, and love breathing easier.  Win all around!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! How smart to use clay that naturally pulls gunk from your pores?! I have really sensitive skin, and this product doesn&#x27;t bother me even though there are essential oils which have a strong scent but are all natural. My skin feels soft and silky when I use this (about 2-3 times a week)</li>
    <li> Love this for acne prone skin!</li>
    <li> My teens LOVE this product.  Effective and quick results.</li>
    <li> I Received This Product At A Discount In Exchange For An Honest Review. Package Arrived On Time. Very Good Quality, Not Cheaply Made. cleared My Skin Up. This Stuff Really Works!</li>
    <li> My skin looks clearer after using this for just a few days.  I will buy more.</li>
    <li> I did not have the raving results that are posted. I found that the product is best used if not on a damp face. I remove makeup with a cleansing cloth first. Apply lotion in circular motion to cleanse, then attempt to make an even layer. Brush my teeth and then wash off using a wash cloth to get a little exfoliation. It did not dissolve black heads. If I extract pores first, the product ever so slightly puffs pores so foundation looks good. This size really only has enough product to maybe last 3 weeks. I am willing to try one more bottle to see if longer use may improve results. It does leave the skin nicely moisturized so that the skin is not trying to hydrate itself making make up greasy. I only experienced a very slight difference</li>
    <li> Love how this makes my face feel.</li>
    <li> A safe product for delicate skin and it work too.</li>
    <li> This was terrible. Not worth the money. If i could rate 0 I would</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I&#x27;ve tried that managed to make my forehead and nose smooth and blackhead free.</li>
    <li> This stuff is good !  It does what it says, easy to use and effective.  After a facial at a local salon they wanted me to buy a product twice as expensive as this, but after finding this on Amazon I am perfectly satisfied.  It is as good, or better than the more costly salon product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works, plain and simple. After only several uses, my nose blackheads have disappeared. I have struggled with them, and finding a solution, for years. Don&#x27;t scrub too harshly. Go gently in a circular motion. If, after several uses, there are still blackheads remaining, press out gently. The cleanser will have loosened them significantly.</li>
    <li> I have relatively clear, non oily skin, and this product caused me to actually Caused me to have breakout with pimples....all i was trying to do was minimize the pores on my nose.</li>
    <li> Really surprised at the difference this has made in the size of my pores and reducing the amount of blackheads. Makes my skin feel tighter without feeling dry. Great product!</li>
    <li> I adore this product!!!! It makes my face feel baby soft, and it actually works! I used to have really deep set blackheads on my nose, and huge pores on my cheeks. Since I started using this product (about two months), my pores and blackheads are almost 100% gone. I could literally see a difference overnight. Once you use this product, you will never use anything else</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product for a little over a week, and I have noticed significant improvement in the overall condition of my skin.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a particular difference in the size of my pores or in the number of blackheads on my nose and chin, but I also understand this can sometimes take time to really notice improvement.  My skin overall does look healthier and is softer, so I&#x27;m very happy with the product even if it isn&#x27;t able to totally help with the never-ending problem of blackheads.  (Hopefully it will, though.)</li>
    <li> My complexion has improved dramatically with this product.  Researched before purchase.  Product is so expensive, only con.  I have noticed a huge decrease in whiteheads.  Pores are significantly smaller and blackheads have lost color.  Lives up to reviews.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I am almost 65 and have had trouble with blackheads on my nose.  That&#x27;s the only place I get them.  They were impossible to remove until I tried this product.  I have only been using it for 5 days and my problem has been solved.  No More Blackheads.  My pores are noticeably smaller and the ugly blackheads are completely gone. The skin become soft after use so you don&#x27;t have to put moisturizer on after just getting everything off.  Might not be the same for everyone - I have normal skin and only ever had a problem with my nose. I did notice a slight burning in the area it was applied to but HECK the results were way worth it.  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you for a fantastic product.  I will purchase again and rave about it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me sadly.</li>
    <li> I use it religiously but not a difference. Smells weird and acts weird too. Don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> This is quite possibly the most amazing product ever! I was hesitant at first but shouldn&#x27;t have been. Worked the first time on both myself and my daughter! She was blown away and you know how teenagers can be skeptical!&lt;br /&gt;I will be a repeat customer for the life of the product!</li>
    <li> I wanted this for the pores on my nose.  As I have gotten older (I am 64), the pores have gotten larger.  Larger pores attract dirt and look grubby.  This product seems to have shrunk the size of the pores as well as keeping them clean.  Maybe keeping them clean just makes them look smaller.  Whichever, I like it and I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect!!!!</li>
    <li> I like the product to soon to tell how well it works, but way over priced for what you get.</li>
    <li> It feels nice and I like it -- for the money----- I can get something that works just as well cheaper-- I wouldn&#x27;t buy again because of price</li>
    <li> the only thing this did for me is cause acne.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. No more blackheads!!</li>
    <li> Great smell, didn&#x27;t do anything for my blackheads sadly.</li>
    <li> It is too early to tell, but so far seems very good.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have bought two bottles so far! My face feels clean and looks smooth! I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Muti-function and great one.</li>
    <li> I am hooked on this.  Love the fact that it’s all natural.  I was not seeing immediate results - but after a few weeks my pores are now noticeably smaller and it really did a good job cleaning and unclogging my pores.  But I recommend using this every other day during winter – probably too potent for daily use.  Oh – how could I forget!  I see no trace of any blackheads – so this also works to keep them away!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I started seeing results within a couple of days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with blackheads for years, and no product ever made a difference - until now. My skin is very dry so many products, like Proactiv, make it flaky. I also don&#x27;t have a lot of extra time for a long beauty routine. This product is great! Not only does it make my pores appear smaller, but regular use has reduced the amount of blackheads on my face. I still have some, but I have 30+ years of clogged pores to undo. Since you only have to leave it on for 2-3 minutes, I&#x27;m able to use it every day - and it does not dry out my skin at all. If you&#x27;re considering this as a solution, I recommend giving it a try. It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve used for clear pores, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products over the years.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this product before writing a review.  So here it is...  Product arrived 3 days after I ordered even with standard free shipping ( I do not have amazon prime so no 2 day free shipping for me!)  The first time using this product I wetted my face then I massaged in an amount of the product about the size of a quarter for about 1-2 minutes.. It felt thin and it also tangled instantly. I will admit the thin part worried me at first.. After massaging it in I let it sit on my face for a few minutes then I washed off the product with lukewarm water then once I had no more face wash on my face I splashed ice cold water to close my pores ( I have cystic acne and massive clogged pores) once I patted my face dry I applied a 2.5% retinol lotion.  That was day 1 couldn&#x27;t really say much but I felt nice and clean, so jumping forward about 2 weeks.  I noticed I started to massively break out. I knew this was positive believe it or not. All my pores were cleaning themselves by pushing the gunk out.  As hideous as I felt I have continued  using this product and I am glad I did!! I use to have bumps all over my face.... small annoying bumps everywhere...and don&#x27;t forget a cyst here or there, and the white and blackheads galore... I  am 26 years old and let&#x27;s just say I was very depressed over my skin issues!! As of now the bumps are not as high and I have a quarter of the ones that I had before! I did notice my skin was drying out but the retinol face lotion works amazing as long as u remember to use it!  I will be purchasing this face wash from here on out. The price concerned me but now it just makes sense cause it actually works.  So if you try this and u notice you are breaking out more than a usual, just give it a little time like I did.  It is so nice to finally find a product that actually works!!</li>
    <li> This cleanser is a bit expensive, but I decided to try it because it has a money-back guarantee. I&#x27;m so glad I did! I&#x27;m 54 years old and I still have a problem with blackheads on my nose. After 2 weeks of using this product, most of the blackheads are gone and my skin feels softer. It&#x27;s very refreshing, too --- cool and minty. I&#x27;ll definitely be adding this cleanser to my morning routine.</li>
    <li> I have very oily and non sensitive skin, but this managed to break me out.  I do not know how well it is cleaning as there is mint which leaves your face tingly.  I would get a full refund if I didn&#x27;t use it already.  Price is crazy for a small bottle. Not for me.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Feels great on the skin and works very well.  Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. Not very gritty. Tingles when it&#x27;s on the face but disnt really work for me.</li>
    <li> 1st the bottle is EXTREMELY SMALL. For some reason I thought that I would be getting a 8oz bottle like most products but  this was 4oz and looks smaller than that. My mom called it &amp;#34;doll sized&amp;#34; because it looks like the right bottle size for a doll if you were playing grocery shop or something...Anyway  you get basically nothing for the price. It did NOT clear up my chin acne which is why I bought it in the first place. It did NOT close my pores. It smells nice and feels slightly tingly but it is not an acne wash. I bought a coffee scrub from Franks body that did more for my black heads in one use than this stuff after a month of use and for half the price! Buy this if you want something that smells nice to put on your face or get this if you already have great skin.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what it says it will do.... Still getting them. Thumbs down</li>
    <li> Great product! After a little trial and error I found that it works best as a morning cleanser/makeup primer. It didn&#x27;t agree at all with any other moisturizers, probably because it does that too. My T-zone is looking better than ever, and the overall benefits are very good. If it continues to go well, I&#x27;ll make this a regular part of my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> Loved the smell And slight tingly feel. I&#x27;m not sure how much it helped by blackheads... But I don&#x27;t always leave it on for the full 2-3 minutes. Great company and great products. Would recommend for the ladies that like the spa experience at home..</li>
    <li> This product certainly cleaned my pores, but very drying for my over 60 skin.  Not for me, but I would recommend it to anyone with oily skin.  Nice scent!</li>
    <li> It really works clean out pores!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 25 and I have great skin other than my problem blackheads that I&#x27;ve never been able to get rid of. I&#x27;ve tried the strips, I&#x27;ve tried the Aztec Healing Clay with apple cider vinegar, multiple brands of facewash, mud masks- all to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d pretty much given up hope and although this product is slightly on the pricier side, I&#x27;m glad I found it. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for two weeks and I&#x27;ve had amazing results. My entire face is much cleaner and my blackheads are as good as gone. I&#x27;ve gotten multiple compliments on how great my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m almost out but I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this product again, I highly recommend it. I&#x27;ve never written a product review but this was worth it.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this product that I purchased,  It has 100% met my expectations.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s working. I have horrible pores on my nose area. Had this stuff for 2-3weeks.  I feel like this stuff makes my pore areas clean and fresh cause of the minty-ness. but it&#x27;s really not worth the money. buying a very good face mask works better for pores.</li>
    <li> I buy plenty of stuff from Amazon but rarely if ever do I write a review. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little less than a week and I&#x27;ve seen real and dramatic change. My problem area is my nose and cheeks. Yes, my pores are still visible but they&#x27;ve gone from large and clogged with dirt and oil to noticeably smaller and most importantly clean. To anyone considering this product but scared away by the price, even at Amazon&#x27;s significant discount, I urge you to try it. The bottle is small but I&#x27;ve found a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m sure I wont have to buy another till next year.</li>
    <li> good product although I&#x27;m waiting my surprise...</li>
    <li> Great for pores but definitely dries skin out. I&#x27;ve taken to selectively using it only on problem areas to minimize drying.</li>
    <li> Product does not perform as advertised.  I used this product as directed for 2 weeks on one side of my face.  There is no difference at this point in either side of my face.  I will say, however, it is super tingly which feels pretty nice, but for the money - you can just use rubbing alcohol for that effect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 64 years old, and, yet, still have extremely oily skin.  I think I&#x27;ve tried every product on the market since my 20&#x27;s, and nothing has worked like this one!!  It has made an amazing difference in my skin!  It feels clean/looks clean.  Others have noticed, too.  All I can say is, &amp;#34;Where has this product been all my life?!&amp;#34;  THANK YOU!!!!</li>
    <li> I had a pretty ugly blackhead on my nose. For weeks I tried everything to get rid of it. I even asked my girlfriend for some beauty tips. Nothing worked. After awhile I noticed it getting bigger so I became desperate. I did something most guys would ever do... I visited a beauty salon that specializes in skin care. Fortunately for me, the lady I spoke to didn&#x27;t want to take my money and told me to just pick up a bottle of Vi-Tae Blackhead remover. She told me all this mombo jumbo about why and how it works and I pretended like I understood but it all flew over my head. I went home later that night and found it on Amazon. Honestly, I didn&#x27;t want to spend $30+ dollars on a health and beauty product because, well, I&#x27;m a guy. But I took the lady&#x27;s advice and went with it. Like Prime normally does, I got it in two days. I followed the directions - apply every morning to damp skin, let it sit for a few minutes and rinse. I have to be honest... I didn&#x27;t see any difference after the first day. The blackhead was still there. I did it again the second day. Nothing. Third day. Zilch. Fourth day. Nada. I was becoming impatient and felt ripped off. However, after I applied it on the fifth day, the blackhead was gone after I rinsed it! I was like WHOA! This girly stuff really works. Before I start to rave about this stuff, I have to say that it didn&#x27;t get it all out. If I look close enough, I can still see a tiny spec left in my pore. But I&#x27;ll just continue using this stuff and see what happens. In all honesty, no one else can see it anymore. But my girlfriend said to continue keeping it clean so it doesn&#x27;t come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I&#x27;m a 31 year old Asian male with pretty oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Actually works but it can take up to a week to remove a large blackhead&lt;br /&gt;- Smells good and refreshing&lt;br /&gt;- Directions are easy to follow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- This stuff will sting the first few times you use it. It&#x27;s not unbearable but it&#x27;s pretty annoying&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a tad difficult to rinse off after you let it sit for a few minutes</li>
    <li> I cant really tell if this product is working. It might be better with a little more exfolliant.</li>
    <li> Been using it 3 days now. Face is smoother, still seeing some blackheads though, although can&#x27;t feel them anymore. Hopefully they&#x27;re gone with continued use.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 4 days now.. my skin had a lot of clogged pores.. nose and forehead between eyebrows and chin areas.&lt;br /&gt;I use morning and night.  At night time I wash my face with my regular cleaners to take off make up, than I use vitac for the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;feels clean... I have some pimple on my skin.. I wonder if this will help on pimple as well as blackhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But so far, I like it.  I do have a lot of oil clogged so let see how it works out for me in a few more weeks later.&lt;br /&gt;I will write the review again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 8th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I used this product morning and night for about 3 weeks now, my pores are cleaner.  But  pore size is still same but I notice less oils clogging.  My nose looks cleaner and chin is cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I will continually use this product.  I think it&#x27;s working pretty fast.  My skin still get oily though... let see in a about a month later.  I am not sure if I should get the other one for make up remover... Lavender one..</li>
    <li> This product is good. Im using this every in the morning and at night before I go sleep. Almost 2 wks since I use this. Im planning to buy this nxt time.</li>
    <li> So far, I am not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened my bottle and the product just oozed out  of  the  opening. I hadn&#x27;t squeezed it, I had done nothing to  make it just spit out a half dollar  sized amount of the product.  It just poured out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t  care for the smell, it reminded me of  a household  cleaner. It made me cough  a little and my skin burn until I cleaned  it  off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My skin feels softer and grease - free after first use. But it does stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received  this  product  at  a  discount  in  exchange  for  my honest  review.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried this product I noticed how different this face wash is from my normal face wash; it left my skin feeling clean and fresh, without drying it out! After a week of using the product, I really do notice smaller pores, and clearer skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I both love and hate the scent of this product. I love the fact that it has a eucalyptus-like effect that clears my sinuses. I don&#x27;t like the &#x27;organic&#x27; scent of the product that continues to linger long after I wash my face. It reminds me of mushrooms, and I hate mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two cons are simple:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price- $34 for a 4.5oz bottle is extremely pricey! I&#x27;m not sure I can afford to keep buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time- The length of time recommended to scrub your face, and leave it on your face is a total of five minutes. There&#x27;s not much else you can do while washing your face, so this either extends your shower time, or getting-ready time in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest pro is that I have clear, healthy-looking skin after only 5 days of using this product!</li>
    <li> Bought this after reading many good reviews. Have bad case of oily t-zone specially nose area. This one little bottle packs up a good solution to such problem. Used it next day of received package by third day several people noticed my face looking healthier. Pores seem tighter it so relaxing to have on face for 3 minutes due to botanical scent. Nice healthy glow on face but not a greasy glow lol.</li>
    <li> This is just ok.  It does have a nice tingly feeling when you use it, so it feel refreshing.  I don&#x27;t have large pores but I do have a few blackheads on my nose.  I didn&#x27;t see any change and when I used the product on my forehead I broke out more than normal.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!! I hesitated on purchasing this product. I feel it is on th  pricey side for the  amount received, but it&#x27;s well worth it. My blackheads are disappearing and no new ones have formed. I use it in the evening to clean my face. It says morning but evening works best for me. I love  the way it feels as I clean my face. It doesn&#x27;t leave that tight dry feeling like some cleansers. I will be purchasing this over and over again.</li>
    <li> Have been using for a week now, and the only difference I can see is, my skin is softer, but the blackheads are still intact. After reading the reviews, it seems some people have seen results in a week&#x27;s time, but not me, my moisturizer gave me the same results, as fair as the softening of the skin.  Purrchase this for the blackhead remover, so I am a bit dissapointed. Expensive also, for such a small bottle.</li>
    <li> Very effective product. Blackheads are gone!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser for a few months now. I didn&#x27;t notice a change in pore size, but I can&#x27;t really complain because I have relatively tight pores in general. It doesn&#x27;t remove all your blackheads overnight. (I&#x27;m not sure if it removes blackheads at all or it just reduces the appearance.) I will say that if you follow the directions and leave the cleanser on for a few minutes, you will instantly notice that your blackheads appear smaller. This product also has a wonderful herbal-minty scent and my skin always feels refreshed after washing it in the morning. Make sure you make the time to really massage it in and leave it on for a few minutes in the mornings, otherwise, you are not reaping the benefits. Overall, it&#x27;s a solid product and you will love how awake your skin feels afterwards.</li>
    <li> This stuff just didn&#x27;t deliver the results that it said it would. It&#x27;s a regular face wash...that&#x27;s it</li>
    <li> done nothing&lt;br /&gt;for my oily skin and huge pores</li>
    <li> It really does gently clean your pores...and it has a mild tingle to it.</li>
    <li> Great,  non-irritating cleanser.  Decongests and calms skin. Improved clarity with a smoother more even complexion.</li>
    <li> In just 4-5 day honestly made huge difference.  I have &amp;#34;congested pores&amp;#34; pores that just fill up. This gives my face a ruddy look.  I am a few months from 50.  In just a few days it is like a different face.  Smooth and nice glow.  Doing a great job on blackheads as well.  I am using with https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NLKAVL4/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 and then moisturizer.  I will recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> Does NOT work, if anything this has made my blackheads worse!!  I was 100% compliant and had not changed any other of my face washing routines.  It was THIS product!  It does tingle/burn when you apply it too.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, great fast delivery. I will be reordering, Do you have a larger size?  Love the smell of this product.</li>
    <li> this didn&#x27;t really get rid of my blackheads. so i don&#x27;t use it everyday. i just use it as a mask sometimes if I&#x27;m feeling particularly oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently been on the warpath for something to fight my middle-aged (okay, just aged) acne that has popped up to join my wrinkles, age spots, and gray hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say first that I am not an experienced user of either cosmetics or products claiming to clear your skin. That said, I have found that rose oil water is effective at shortening the life of some of my acne. I think THIS product is actually either eliminating some blackheads, or at least making my pores smaller. And it smells and feels really good when you use it. Very pleasant texture somewhere between a mud mask and extremely fine exfoliant. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and I live in an extremely dry high desert climate, but it isn&#x27;t oily, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to put it on after you wash your face, and then wait a few minutes, which does add time to my morning routine of washing my face and then just heading out the door. But I believe it is worth it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be realistic in your expectation of any face products, none of them can give you skin like Nicole Kidman. I&#x27;m still breaking out with my annoying &#x27;spots&#x27; but this product does seem to make my pores less conspicuous, which for me is quite an achievement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was give a sample of this to use and provide a review.</li>
    <li> Will be ordering again.  Great product</li>
    <li> not working as described..</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this cleaner, but I can&#x27;t. The smell is wonderful, and the tingle feels great even after you wash it off. But, after 3 days of using it I was so broke out that I had to stop. I haven&#x27;t broken out like that in years. So, although it has its good points, I will not be ordering it again. I don&#x27;t consider myself having overly sensitive skin; although very oily and prominent pores on the nose and chin area. May work for other people. Shipping was great and communication was outstanding by the supplier.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my neice since she is struggling with some acne right now.  She is using twice per day and she said it is helping.  It is making her pores actually look smaller after she uses it (so that will help with preventing more blackheads).  She is really glad I found this for her.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! !!</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend to use around his nose where he gets blackheads. He can quickly use this and be done. I have noticed an improvement in this area since he started using it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, very happy that I bought this.  Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, probably because the products I&#x27;ve purchased over the years, and it&#x27;s been a lot,  don&#x27;t do what they claim their suppose to do. But this product is amazing. I&#x27;m 48 and have had problem skin practically my whole adult life. Oily skin, large pores and blackheads. After just one use I saw a noticeable improvement in my skin. After the second use I&#x27;m virtually blackhead free. My skin feels less oily and healthy. Plus a little goes a long way. I love that it&#x27;s all natural, and the smell is refreshing, too.  Thank you</li>
    <li> The product is OK but I have not been faithful in using it daily.  I need to use it more often. It seems to work when I use it!! Please re-send the list of tips for use of this product.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It worked good for me.  I love the smell too.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff I have very fair skin  and this really help shrink my poor on my nose.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my teenage daughter.  She has been getting horrible acne for about a year now and we have tried tons of products but nothing worked.  She hates the smell and color but after just the first use there was an enormous change.  This stuff really works and we are definitely going to continue to buy this.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference in my skin actually it just burned... My skin made it dry and chapped.</li>
    <li> Loved it! It is refreshing and provides radiance to my acne prone T zone.  I don&#x27;t know what to do without it now.</li>
    <li> It may work on others, but it doesn&#x27;t work on me. I got more blackheads than I started.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to use in the morning daily as instructed on the bottle for a week, got slightly  more blackheads. Then used morning and night daily for another week, even more blackheads appeared. Now I stopped using it completed and switched back to Neutrogena which slows down the appearances but not able to remove it.</li>
    <li> It really works...took away my blackheads from my nose....</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I am pleasantly surprised and very pleased with the quality of the ingredients.  My husband and I could both see a difference in our skin after our 1st use!!!  I am very picky, very rarely ever write reviews, and expect a lot from a product.  I generally feel that you receive no greater than half of what a product promises to offer.  But in this case, I have to give it a A+++.  Honestly.  It makes my skin feel so fresh and invigorated.  It&#x27;s not strong (at least to the touch), but is obviously powerful by the immediate results.  You can tell that the ingredients are very pure and high quality also.  I am 54 years young and feel like my skin has the opportunity to look younger now because of this product.  My pore decreased in size by at least half!!!  Great Product!!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product did not do what it promised. I am still using it in hopes that maybe it will just take more time. So far I see no difference at all.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to like this product because it&#x27;s too expensive for my budget. But it works as described and it doesn&#x27;t inflame my rosacea. I&#x27;ve only used it for a week, but those tiny blackheads around my nose and chin are noticeably disappearing, my pores are smaller and my skin is very soft! This is the absolute best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used on my face. I&#x27;m 60 plus years old. My rosacea is serious and most soaps and cleansers leave my face feeling and looking burned. Not this product. It seems to be calming. I did have some &amp;#34;breakout&amp;#34; for the first few days of use. I think the cleanser brought some latent issues to the surface. I hope this progress continues. I&#x27;ll update my review when I finish the bottle.   Update: I don&#x27;t know what the makers of this product did to change the formula. Or maybe they used different suppliers for their ingredients. But this product is NOT THE SAME as the first bottle I bought. The color is different, the texture is different and the results are different, mainly, no results at all, as if I hadn&#x27;t washed my face. My face got redder and redder and splotchy with no reduction of blackheads, etc. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> This product works surprisingly well. Used before a bath for couple of days and blackheads are gone! Used to use the strips which are painful to remove. These left no allergic reaction and no rashes. The packing was wonderful with a layer of plastic above.  The scent is also nice and I have no hesitation in recommending this product. Sample was provided in exchange of a honest and fair reviews.  I don&#x27;t accept samples unless  Ido research on products and find they will be useful and are of high quality. This was proved by this product!</li>
    <li> I love this product, my age 53, skin texture olive and am an outside person.person. Im using this 2 times a day as per instructions and with a face brush.&lt;br /&gt;10 days later the results are pores are clean,smaller and even a couple of larger pores i was self conscious about have shrunk alot.&lt;br /&gt;Skin texture is softer and no need for moisturizer and more even in color.&lt;br /&gt;I am also dotting it on my larger pores at night and sleeping with it on ,this stuff works! without stripping or irritating my skin, less breakouts and nice minty tingle when it sits on my skin will be ordering again and again.</li>
    <li> I have had no problems with this product and I do have very sensitive skin.  I think my pores are smaller after using this.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!!! I could not be happier! It has done so much to improve my complexion. White heads dry up and black heads literally are dried up and stick out of your skin and wipe off. My pores are so clear and appear to be less visible. It does dry a little so I use Aveeno calming wipes after so I&#x27;m not re-clogging pores with lotions. This remedy is amazing and the only thing that has gotten rid of my whiteheads and black heads. I&#x27;m so happy with this stuff!!! Worth EVERY penny!!!</li>
    <li> This product works!  I&#x27;m amazed how my blackheads have been minimized in the past two weeks!  I have somewhat sensitive skin, have had no negative reaction, and my blackheads in the T-zone are disappearing.  I&#x27;m thrilled!</li>
    <li> I do find it helps remove black heads  I like the smell and feel of this product.  The seller was good. No issues with the purchase or delivery.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love! Great product, my skin looks great, smells great, feels great, and with the addition of Catherine&#x27;s hyaluronic acid applied post wash with this cleanser...an awesome, killer combo.  I&#x27;m early 40s with skin issues from too much sun and 1/2 dozen large pores.  Saw a significant difference in about a week.</li>
    <li> I used this for four days and had to stop. I ended up with a severe case of eczema around my mouth, my right eye at the bridge of the nose and in my right hairline.  I followed the directions as shown on the bottle and in the email.  I also feel it may have thinned the skin on my nose to the point where when I removed my nightly Breathe Right from my nose, a chunk of skin peeled off.  I&#x27;ve used Breathe Rights off and on for weeks at a time over the past three years and have never had this happen before.</li>
    <li> Have not used it long enough to determine its efficacy.  Still waiting to see.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for three weeks and it has done nothing but made my face oily as well as serious break outs.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to proactiv solution.&lt;br /&gt;Huge waste of money.</li>
    <li> I really liked the smell it was very clean and fresh... Didn&#x27;t really notice too much of a difference in my blackheads... It actually caused my face to break out in more pimples.... I kept trying it thinking it might get better but after a couple months decided it wasn&#x27;t for me!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have huge pores and blackheads on my nose. After using this product for 2 weeks I have very few blackheads and my pores actually look smaller. My face feels clean! I use it in the morning and I have less shine all day long. I love it so much and am on my second order of the product!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband who has been cursed with the worst pores, and they are just constantly clogged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hard for him to find an effective &amp;#34;unclogger&amp;#34;  without tearing apart his really sensitive skin, so most cleansers are a no-go for us.&lt;br /&gt;While it has only been a week, (and I can&#x27;t obviously speak about massive pore shrinkage yet) I CAN say that he is THRILLED that this stuff doesn&#x27;t make his skin flare up and get all red, and cause him pain.  So he&#x27;s actually been able to use it every night because it is gentle enough, and I&#x27;m noticing less clogs, so that&#x27;s AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to do a follow-up review if that&#x27;s possible down the road and let you know how the pore-shrinkage is going.  But we&#x27;re over the moon happy with this product so far!  I&#x27;m just happy he&#x27;s found something that works for him!</li>
    <li> Hands down the best product I&#x27;ve ever used. Little bit is enough to clean all of your face and it&#x27;s only been 4 days and I can tell the difference it&#x27;s created. Highly recommended :)</li>
    <li> First and foremost, I received this product for free to review by the company. Since I have already fallen in love with their mask/scrub &amp;#34;Get Refreshed&amp;#34;,  I had high hopes for this. Luckily, I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. I must also point out that I have very oily skin that also has the tendency of being very sensitive. Things can break me out in a heartbeat so I&#x27;m always very cautious. Despite this company using oils in their line, they seem to use oils that are safe for acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people with oily skin stay away from products containing oils however, this is not a good idea. Yes, certain oils can wreak havoc for us but that&#x27;s only if they&#x27;re not the right ones. We needs moisture just like everyone else. Avoiding oil based products is a myth and can lead to your skin becoming more imbalanced. And if that&#x27;s not bad enough, premature aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for my assessment. More Than Clean is really impressive. The product is like a greenish color, smells awesome and is thick consistency. Though it&#x27;s a cleanser, don&#x27;t expect it to foam or soap up like a traditional one. A little goes a long way and you use it on damp skin. I rub it in and let it sit for a 3 minutes before washing it off in order for it to penetrate. After washing it off with lukewarm water, it&#x27;s amazing. It leaves my skin feeling tingly and really clean. I get absolutely no shine despite my face feeling lightly moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday, I used it with my Clarisonic Mia and got even BETTER RESULTS! I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to have pore shrinkage though. One thing I do notice is that my skin feels tighter but not in a dried out way. It&#x27;s like the same feeling you get after a really great facial at the spa. I&#x27;ll keep using and update on pore shrinkage because I do have a a problem area which is my nose (especially the sides).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefits of the main Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peppermint: It contains menthol that nourishes dull skin and boosts the texture of oily skin.

    <li> To say that my skin is sensitive is an understatement. I’m one of those nice lil Irish boys whose skin burns on a cloudy day, and whose face produces enough oils to… well… it’s just extremely oily. So one can appreciate how nervous I was when I was about to try this new product on my fair skin. I was afraid I’d break out in some horrible rash and need an immediate trip to the hospital (dramatization I know), but at the end of the day, I needed to do something to help me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not an expert with these products. I&#x27;ve used what my wife has at times; it’s a brand from a major department store that has “Steps”. First you need to remove the oil with some solution on a cotton ball, then the scrub, and then when all is said and done, you need to apply a lotion. After using that for a few days I noticed a difference, but the process wasn&#x27;t what I wanted to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks now and I love the results. After the first application, my wife and I were able to see a noticeable difference in the size of my pores and the intensity of the blackheads in my nose and forehead regions.&lt;br /&gt;Every morning, I apply it after brushing my teeth and rinse it off in the shower, so it stays on a bit longer than the recommended Two minutes.  Though I still do see blackheads on my forehead and nose, I’m hopeful that after a little longer, I’ll start seeing fewer and fewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m beyond happy with this product, it’s easy and I personally see and feel results. I get well into the day, and can still feel my nose and forehead nice and clean, a lot less oily and it almost feels like I&#x27;ve applied a lotion to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using this product, there was a slight burning sensation on my upper cheekbone area, but now I don’t feel a thing. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to cleanse their skin for a fraction of the cost/time some of the other brands give you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne for 55 years, which has caused major enlarged facial pores.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of pore minimizing products but NONE has EVER done the job like Vi-Tae&#x27;s More Than Clean!!!  In just 1 weeks time, I could visibly see the difference and now at 17 days use, I see a remarkable difference.  The condition and texture of my skin has also changed and I&#x27;ve noticed some dark spots starting to look lighter or almost invisible.  I&#x27;m not saying this product will remove dark spots, I&#x27;m just saying I&#x27;ve noticed a change in MY spots.  I HIGHLY recommend this product!  I currently use Basis Cleaner Clean Face Wash to remove my makeup, especially mascara, because it&#x27;s 100% oil-free and soap-free.  But, I&#x27;ve ordered the Lavender Facial Cleanser &amp; Makeup Remover and can&#x27;t wait to see what it will do.</li>
    <li> I have used for about a week but definetly i am buying more . My face feels clean and refresh . !!</li>
    <li> This is one of the most unique, refreshing, organic cleansers I&#x27;ve ever used. It is truly a thrill every time I wash my face. Afterwards, my skin feels so soft pliable. Not over dried and taut like most soaps. I truly appreciate the natural ingredients and lack of artificial fragrance. There is a distinct scent - it smells deliciously green and minty - but you can tell it&#x27;s from the ingredients, not some harsh synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge change in the quantity of blackheads on my skin or a reduction in pores, so I can&#x27;t exactly call it a miracle product. The directions suggest using it once a day, every morning. I have been following that routine pretty well (it&#x27;s the perfect cleanser to wake you up and make you feel refreshed) but I continue to use my more powerful cleanser at night since I have acne-prone skin. This seems to work out nicely. Personally I would recommend this product more for aging skin or those who do not have to worry about breakouts. I don&#x27;t think it would CAUSE breakouts, but it doesn&#x27;t prevent them from happening either, so unfortunately I have to keep up with my harsher stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: If you&#x27;re sick of having painfully dry skin after washing your face, give this a try. It is super gentle, super hydrating, and makes you feel like heaven hours after the last splash of water. The bottle is fairly small, but it lasts a long time. I give it an above-average recommendation.</li>
    <li> AMAZING how you see results on first day of use!!!</li>
    <li> This product seems to be a SCAM. I bought it because I wanted a safe, painless way to remove blackheads. It says right on the label that it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;blackhead remover.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for two weeks with absolutely NO difference in my skin. Yes, my skin tingles when I use it, but that&#x27;s because there&#x27;s a crap load of mint oil or something in it so it will seem like it&#x27;s doing something. But, in reality, it&#x27;s NOT. My blackheads are still intact and show no signs of going anywhere.  There is NO CHANGE in my skin. NONE. I highly doubt that in a month it will make a difference. I&#x27;ll need to go to a real aesthetician to get the blackheads removed. Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did. I&#x27;ll never get it back. Total SCAM!</li>
    <li> Using this once a day reduces the black head slowly. The second week I started using it twice a week, it drastically reduced the black head. After four weeks I still have the black head. So far as a remover, it hasn&#x27;t. But as a reducer it works great. fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This stuff works well.  So well, in fact, I&#x27;ve purchased three of them.  I use it nightly, though, as opposed to its recommendation of using it in the morning.  First, I wipe my makeup off with a makeup-removing towelette.  Then I rinse my face with warm water and lightly pat dry.  I apply this evenly over my face and leave it on for five minutes, then rinse.  Sadly, the price on this product has gone up so much since my first purchase that I will not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Works wonders.  I have large pores throughout my T zone.  This product has helped significantly.  This is another must have.</li>
    <li> I am 29 with combo skin. I live in a dry and cold city where 10 degrees f is the norm for winter. I am conscious about what I eat, get enough sleep, and exercise. I also have had success at work so I&#x27;m not stressed. I do have the biggest pores and own a strawberry nose. I bought this product because I started to notice the blackheads spread to my chin and between my brows. I was desperate and impressed by the reviews. After finishing almost all of the bottle, I feel like one of those people in the 1800s who bought a miracle potion quacks used to peddle. I recommend reading the ingredients before purchasing. Seriously, queen Helens mint mask mixed with some glycerin and castor oil would get you the same thing.</li>
    <li> This cleanser was incredible in removing stubborn blackheads and acne from stress. Did exactly what was described and smells wonderful. My skin changes a lot between seasons so I recommend it if you are going through a change in the season or in the winter especially. Must try!!</li>
    <li> It makes my face really really dry and my face is peeling. and it does not seem to minimize my pores at all.</li>
    <li> As someone who has tried every face wash, cream, lotion, potion, and mask there is to get rid of the unsightly blackheads on my nose, I was hesitant at first to order yet another product claiming to solve the problem.  It has been a little over a week now and I want to shout from the rooftops that this product worked for me!  More Than Clean is my go-to product from now on!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tested this for about 10 days now and noticed an improvement in my skin - I simply use a small amount before showering, leave it on my face for 3-5 minutes and then rinse. The effect is similar to using clay facial treatments that are left on the skin much longer yet it&#x27;s fairly surprising when you use this how soft and moist the skin feels afterwards. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with skin sensitivity and for me it showed positive results within about 5-6 days of making it part of my morning regime. I can&#x27;t speak to the effectiveness of individual ingredients but in terms of the improvements I&#x27;ve noticed, I&#x27;d recommend giving it a try if you have facial skin problems.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it really works. Any changes since two weeks.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, refreshing and rejuvenating! Highly recommended daily mask - no problem for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This really works. My pores look smaller and my face feels clean and refreshing.</li>
    <li> No improvement but no adverse effects.</li>
    <li> I did not see an improvement in my pores but the product is good nontheless. Your skin will feels refresh and smooth. Will buy again  Update: 4/12/15  Ok so Ihad stopped usingthe product (IDK why) and tow days ago I saw it and decided to use it  since I paid for it. It did that befor going to sleep.I woke up the next morning , mad emy way to the bathroom,saw my face in the mirror... lo andbehold my face was PERFECT, it was glowing, soft,looked nice, you name it, even my pores were diminished (no kidding). I shall continue my usage.</li>
    <li> Touted as a deep algae cleaner, the third ingredient (after water and glycerin) is indeed \\&quot;laminaria digitata\\&quot;, which is horsetail kelp.  Add to this some lovely aromatic ingredients such as oils of peppermint, lavender, geranium flowers, apricot kernels, and sage, and you have a very pleasant cleanser/mask that is spa-worthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On your skin it feels tingly, smells pleasantly herbal and you feel as if it&#x27;s really doing what it&#x27;s supposed to.  That&#x27;s my perception and I do enjoy using this.  My results after use are a clean-feeling although dry cutis, but a look in my 8X magnifying mirror doesn&#x27;t tell me my pores are reduced significantly.  Perhaps it requires more than a month of use to see those results, but I did read some reviews here that claimed results after a much shorter period of time, one after only 5 days.  (That seems suspect, IMO, but I suppose results vary.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really wanted to test this product on is the closed-pore white comedones that I sometimes develop because of the necessary use of facial moisturizers for my aging skin.  These are not easy to see except with a magnifying mirror and the number of them isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  However, I haven&#x27;t seen much change so far.  I&#x27;m hoping that continued use will help dry them out, so we shall see.  (There&#x27;s, of course, a Catch-22 situation here involving dried-out skin needing more moisturizer leading to more clogged pores.)  I&#x27;m not too hopeful since even microdermabrasion doesn&#x27;t get to them, but if I see any improvement, I&#x27;ll add that info to this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line for me with this product is that I do like the way it feels and smells while on the skin and the clean feeling and look to the skin it leaves after rinsing it off.  Whether or not my pores are being refined significantly is still to be seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Product was supplied free to me by Vi-Tae.)</li>
    <li> Wow! This product really cleaned out my pores and improved by skin texture.</li>
    <li> 2 stars because I&#x27;m sure it cleans your face. But as for helping the specific problem, no. I have pores with white crud coming out, especially on my chin. This did not help that, at all. Exfoliation with a wash rag is better. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Bought because of all the positive reviews.  Worked great the first week or so.  Then, my skin started breaking out and I had to discontinue.  It may very well work for many folks but it didn&#x27;t suit my skin!</li>
    <li> I usually wait a couple weeks of using a product before I write a review.  However, it&#x27;s very easy to write up a great review on this product after only a few days use.  That&#x27;s how good I find it.  I&#x27;m at the age where the pores on and around my nose have gotten larger.  I have tried various products, but have not gotten the results I&#x27;ve been looking for.  I have to look no further.  It glides on smoothly and easily.  I apply it to my clean face, in small circular motions on both sides, from the center out.  It is almost like a mini mask, and just a little goes a long way.  It has a refreshing, light herbal smell, and the peppermint gives your face a clean tingling feeling.  It is just full of nourishment for your skin.  My pores are looking smaller with each application, and it leaves my whole face feeling and looking more toned.  I actually feel that after the first week, two or three times a week will be sufficient for use to reach the results I&#x27;m looking for.  I will definitely recommend it to family and friends.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works and I am so glad I bought it.  I have been using it faithfully for 5 days now and it is amazing, it removed 2 blackheads from my cheek on the second day and I love the way my face feels after cleaning with it.  It absolutely does remove blackheads but I think only time will tell how well it works on acne altogether.  Plus the seller gives great customer service.  They sent me a personal email to let me know my item had shipped and to give me some tips on the best way to use this product.  I am very happy with my overall purchase and I plan to purchase more from this seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times now and love the fresh, earthy smell. I look forward to continued use to really see great results!</li>
    <li> smells great! like a herbal infusion of tea tree oil and other essences. love the way it cleans!</li>
    <li> Best product I have ever used ( and I have tried countless products in my 20 year struggle with acne</li>
    <li> 5 Stars...&lt;br /&gt;Just been a week we started using it and can see significant difference.&lt;br /&gt;Great Product.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  Expensive, but still an excellent product.  I recommend it highly to anyone who is troubled by skin that needs a deep cleanser.  MY face feels so clean after I use it.</li>
    <li> This product was purchased for my son going through puberty. It&#x27;s helping to lower the amount of acne he recently have.</li>
    <li> Best morning face wash ever. I have very dry skin and after I wash my face it feels so good,relief and REFRESHING! Love it.....</li>
    <li> skin is clean in just a couple of days!!! im really happy with this product! it was expensive, i wish i can have more for the same price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product only for 2 days. My skin feels softer, cleaner and less oily. And it smells so so good!</li>
    <li> I am 35 and have struggled with large pores and blackheads in my t-zone area my entire life. I have tried EVERYTHING...and I seriously mean everything. I decided to give this a try and I am glad I did!!! I have been using it for almost 2 full months and I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my skin!! My pores and blackheads are pretty much nonexistent now!!  I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> Been using it for a week now and it does what it claims to do!!!</li>
    <li> My kids are using this and their faces look great, they feel clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;All their problem areas are clearing up after just a few applications.  I recommend&lt;br /&gt;this product for any teens or adults with any sort of skin problems.  Reviewed&lt;br /&gt;for amztrader.</li>
    <li> I am 65 years old, have some uneven skin tone, wrinkles and a big problem.  I constantly have blackheads all around my mouth near lip are and also chin.  I have normal to dry skin.  I started using this the next morning after receiving it.  I cannot begin to tell you what it did for me on very first day!!  My skin is like a baby&#x27;s face in softness and pores are not visible.  I don&#x27;t even see as any blackheads.  I have have used now for only 3 days and now I see no blackheads.  It seems to ave even softened my wrinkles and evened out the uneven color.  Even under my eyes look better which are sometimes darker and swollen looking.  This is one of the best products I have ever tried, honestly!  Have been looking for something for the blackhead problem for years.  Also the large pores.  Believe me when I say this product delivers and DOES NOT DRY OUT my skin as some have feared.  Thank you  I will continue to purchase and highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I have large pores and have tried many items to keep my face clean and free of blackheads and haven&#x27;t found anything until now...this stuff is amazing!  It was very effective yet didn&#x27;t irritate my skin...it&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
    <li> I must be the unlucky customer. I thought with the amazing reviews this product received, I was sure to be just as pleased. Ive struggled with clogged sebum on my nose and inner cheek area for many years. I used this product in confidence based on the 5 star reviews, as directed. it didnt work for me. I dont know why. Im happy it worked for the other hundreds of people. Im bummed.</li>
    <li> Only been using about 3 weeks so far product works as described. Be sure to read instructions carefully.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a scrub, but that&#x27;s my fault for not reading description thoroughly. Nice cleanser, but doesn&#x27;t work as blackhead remover. I love the minty-ness, leaves a nice clean, refreshing feel.</li>
    <li> I tend to be very skeptical of facial washes, as I have tried very many in my life and none ever get rid of my blackheads. I have very dry skin and most face washes dry me out. I have used biore strips my whole life and they rarely get rid of enough blackheads to even be noticeable, but I used this face wash before I used a strip today and every single blackhead was removed! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. This is very gentle on the skin, didn&#x27;t dry me out, and helped get rid of the blackheads! I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I love this product! Refreshing tingle, cleans my skin thoroughly, my skin is soft and smooth to the touch. I can see why pores would be reduced. I&#x27;m ordering another bottle! By the way. AMAZON...YOU ROCK!”</li>
    <li> love this! my favorite product! tingles at first but defiantly tightens your pore i could tell a difference after using it one time !</li>
    <li> What an amazing product.  I didn&#x27;t quite believe all the hype I read but all the high ratings convinced me to give this product a try.  It is amazing.  You feel it working by the slight tingling on your skin.  After about three days (three uses), I noticed my skin cleaner and brighter.  After a couple of weeks use now, the big pores I had on my cheeks have diminished both from the black heads going away and from the tightening of my skin.  I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Nice product, works well, very refreshing</li>
    <li> Works well, would reorder.</li>
    <li> This stuff works on blackheads on the nose and chin! Have been using it daily in the shower each morning and saw results within about a week. With continued use my face got a little dry so I am only using it every 2 - 3 days now, which is fine with me as the bottle will last longer. FYI - the first time I used it the peppermint oil in it stung somewhat but it was better on the second and third use... my skin is sensitive though.</li>
    <li> I love this blackhead remover. Previous to using this product, I would get blackheads on my nose often. I have oily skin and wear glasses so there is always opportunity for poor skin to develop. The Blackhead remover has done wonders for my skin. It uses heat and scrubbing beads to remove clogged pores. I also recently pierced my nose and used this product through the healing process. I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more!</li>
    <li> I was glad when I was given the opportunity to try this product.  I have tried a lot of products to help me remove the blackheads and have yet to find one that I have been successful with.  I have been using this for about a week now and I have to say that I am quite impressed with how clean and clear my face looks.  Although my face hasn&#x27;t completely cleared up I do see a big improvement.  I am hoping that the longer I use it, I will see an even greater improvement!  The only thing that keeps me from giving this 5 stars is the smell.  It has a very distinct smell that I could really do without but it&#x27;s not too bad that it will keep me from using it!  I am excited to see the results!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe this product is unclogging and shrinking my blackheads! Works fantastic and love the scent!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a few days and, so far, am very pleased with this product. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and I believe I see a difference in pore size. I plan on reordering.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. The green color puts you off at first, but this smells pleasant and works phenomenally.  Worked well on my two preteen daughters and me. Seems to work well for a variety of skin types. We&#x27;ve used just a couple times each, and ever time it is significant improvement.  It&#x27;s like a spa in a bottle.</li>
