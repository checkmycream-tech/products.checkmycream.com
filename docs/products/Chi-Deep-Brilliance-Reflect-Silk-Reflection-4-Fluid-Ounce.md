    <li> This silk oil works really well on straight styles. Once you use it you should be able to go 4 days without adding anything else to your hair. I love it and will buy it again</li>
    <li> Detangles my hair and adds luster. It is also great as a heat protectant.</li>
    <li> If you like \\&quot;Silk Infusion\\&quot;, you will love this product. This is not just a great product for your hair, I&#x27;ve discovered other great uses, which are listed below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * Face Moisturizer: A small dab can help moisturize dry spots on the skin and relieve dry face irritation.&lt;br /&gt;  * Makeup Remover: A small amount on a cotton ball is a very effective and gentle eye makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;  * Hand Lotion: I like to add a few drops to my favorite hand lotion to amp up my lotion.&lt;br /&gt;  * Cuticle Oil: Makes an excellent cuticle oil and helps repair dry cracked cuticles.</li>
    <li> I normally use Kerastase products for shine and softness in my hair as an after-shower leave-in treatment.  I received a sample of this CHI Deep Brilliance in a CHI straightening iron I bought and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I am happy with the results when using it pre-straightening.  If I am not straightening my hair, though, I still prefer my Kerastase products.  I think their conditioning results are a bit better.  Overall though, a nice product, although not my fave.</li>
    <li> I bought a Chi iron and this was included as a sample. I used it only because it was there, so I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much from it. I&#x27;m usually loyal to Ion&#x27;s straightening spray but I&#x27;m glad I gave this a shot...I fell in love with it after the first try, and now I&#x27;m on here to buy a regular size bottle. I&#x27;m black with natural 3c/4a hair and this left my hair feeling silky, smooth and very straight.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth buying. Love it and my hair loves it. A tiny amount goes a long way. Your hair will thank you for using it.</li>
    <li> Love this product...  Light weight and smells great with awesome shine</li>
    <li> excellent hair product and the smell is great</li>
    <li> It makes my hair feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for my hear but made it look dull and dry. Used it as noted on the bottle, but was not for my hair. Not saying that it&#x27;s a bad product, but, that it&#x27;s just not for my hair.</li>
    <li> I love chi infusion in the red bottle and decided to try this one as well.  It left my hair feeling soft and shiny but HEAVY.  Generally olive oil does not take well to my hair.  Each time ive tried it, it just sits on top weighning down my hair and does not absorb.  There is olive oil in this serum and I&#x27;m guessing is what caused it to weight down and grease up my thin hair.  Not sure what to do with it now.  It smells good and isnt sticky to touch so maybe I can use as body oil.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I used it to I flat ironed my (heat resistant) synthetic wig.  It made the sleek soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Purchased from CBS express. Came quickly.  I have been using Chi silk infusion forever and decided to try this instead.  Let me just say I have kinky / wavy ethnic hair.  I love this.  I used a nickle sized drop and used a rolling flat iron as usual. My hair came out smoother and shiner than it ever has with the silk infusion. The fragrance is different than silk infusion. It&#x27;s kind of powdery.  This may be too heavy for fine thin hair but I absolutely recommend this to anyone trying to \\&quot;tame the crazy\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> In May of 2012 I went to New Orleans for my birthday. I was in a beauty supply where I was looking for a smoother, because I have color-treated blonde hair. Beside the register there were two baskets with these little .05 oz testers of this product, so I bought two. Needless to say when I made it back to Houston and used it on my hair...I was BLOWN away by the ability to contain the frizz that you get when you color your hair blonde to platinum blonde...AMAZING! Now I buy it in the $19.00 container because my best friend helps me use it. It&#x27;s an ALL WEATHER product...get it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I&#x27;m definitely a chi fan love this glosser over any other one it gives my dull hair great gloss and love that it smells so good!!</li>
    <li> Nice.... makes hair feel like silk</li>
    <li> The hype was just that, hype. I get better results with suave Moroccan infusion and I&#x27;m a natural with 3c/4a hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair that is relatively damaged from coloring. I had been looking for a product that would smooth down the frizz but not weigh my hair down or make it feel grungy. I&#x27;m a fan of CHI, but I didn&#x27;t really want to pay the price. I tried a lot of cheaper stuff before I went with this. Makes my hair soft and smooth. It does not feel like I have gunk in my hair. It works on wet hair and dry hair.</li>
