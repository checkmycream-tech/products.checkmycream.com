      <li>This is somewhere between 3 and 4; when I wear it more often I&#x27;ll decide whether it&#x27;s really worth replacing.</li>
      <li>it for a gift and my boyfriend loved it , it was a way better price than at actual perfume stores</li>
      <li>Many fragrances end up resembling this flowery, soapy smell; the king of the hill here is Creed Green Irish Tweed, and there are many other good ones I&#x27;ve tried or own, and assuredly a great many besides.</li>
      <li>Find myself sniffing on my arms throughout the day because I love it so much.</li>
      <li>: I&#x27;m a middle-aged professional man, father, who enjoys a nice wardrobe, including fragrances.</li>
      <li>Good stuff on my second bottle!!!!!</li>
      <li>If you want to try something new or  need a gift idea, I will strongly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>On top of the soapy smell, it has extra layers on top of it.  </li>
      <li>The item came as described and shipping was quick.</li>
      <li>like Be Delicious DKNY smells is better than Glenn Perri Unpredictable Eau De Toilette Spray for Men blue bottle...</li>
      <li>Its kind of a cross between a cologne and a vaporette type vagrance</li>
      <li>fragrance starts as a kind of fougere, a green and almost mossy top note.</li>
      <li>Item arrived right on time.</li>
      <li>First time using this cologne and it is worth it</li>
      <li>This is pretty good especially for a everyday or even a formal evening wearing if your kind out on the town.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast!</li>
      <li>It actually smells better than Paco Rabanne 1 million.</li>
      <li>but I actually fell in love with it.  </li>
      <li>But its good and I will keep it on my list as a colognes I would more than likely reorder for my everyday use again.</li>
      <li>this is soft and refreshing but strong enough to drive my hormones wild!</li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>Very synthetic smell.</li>
      <li>and the price is so cheap at my local mall they are selling it for $65</li>
      <li>I wasnt expecting much for $15</li>
      <li>High class smelling cologne.</li>
      <li>and it last pretty well for the day</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s soft scent!</li>
      <li>Anyway, it does clear the bar, with room to spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Yes, clearly so.</li>
      <li>It smells like YSL Lhomme with a very synthetic vibe to it, Lhomme KILLS this fragrance, spend the extra and stick with</li>
      <li>I despise cloying fragrances, especially artificial ones, cheap, synthetic &amp;#34;woods and spices&amp;#34; types (astringent old-man smells), and many &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; fragrances for lack of a better term, based on cinnamon, cardamom, amber.</li>
      <li>I already wrote a review of Glenn Perri Unpredictable Night, and on the basis of that, I expected this to be a solid &amp;#34;mediocre&amp;#34;, nice but unexceptional.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;ll round up, as it is still &amp;#34;very good&amp;#34;, very solid, excellent longevity, and not as instantly forgettable as &amp;#34;Unpredictable Night&amp;#34;.</li>

      <li>My collection is considerable, numbering in &#x27;several hundreds&#x27;.</li>

<li> My collection is considerable, numbering in &#x27;several hundreds&#x27;.</li>
<li> Because the less expensive price I wasn&#x27;t expecting to enjoy it as much,</li>
<li> Ive had this cologne previously and there is a clear difference.</li>
<li> I been using the unpredictable desire intense for 5 yrs now and just decided to try another flavor of the unpredictable.</li>
<li> But the design of the bottle for application is not really practical.</li>
<li> Projection is average, but that&#x27;s to be expected from a 15 bucks cologne.</li>
<li> its has been watered down</li>
<li> Ladies...beware because if your man has this on other ladies will follow!</li>
<li> /&gt;So, now to Glenn Perri Unpredictable.</li>
<li> I took the risk of purchasing Unpredictable based solely on reviews.</li>
<li> but I at least expected the atomizer to work</li>
<li> There was no distinct mid note that I picked up, but the base note is a blaring loud SOAP, a super-clean floral fragrance.</li>
<li> It is manufactured by Geparlys, the same maker that does the dismally bad Karen Low fragrances.</li>
<li> Hard to hold the bottle and spray on.</li>
<li> And what I mean by that is kinda like  </li>
<li> I mean it when I say this that it made my friend (who was not into colognes) a cologne guy and gave me a nosegasm</li>
<li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
<li> can&#x27;t go wrong</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
    <li> my opinion...Glenn Perri Unpredictable Night is best among the lot in this line of scents... this one a bit fruity... like Be Delicious DKNY smells is better than Glenn Perri Unpredictable Eau De Toilette Spray for Men blue bottle... BLUE bottle smells like Azzaro Chrome...</li>
    <li> I been using the unpredictable desire intense for 5 yrs now and just decided to try another flavor of the unpredictable. It&#x27;s not as good as intense but I like it and it smells good.</li>
    <li> Item arrived right on time. I love this fragrance. It is a beautifully done YSL L&#x27;homme clone. I absolutely love it. Projection is average, but that&#x27;s to be expected from a 15 bucks cologne. People, there are some clones out here that does an outstanding job copying the original. Check out Lomani Millionaire. It actually smells better than Paco Rabanne 1 million. Do your research before dropping big bucks on name brand fragrances.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he loved it.</li>
    <li> is excelent... good quality, nice desing, and perfect present, thanks so much</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and since it is oil based it lasts longer on your skin. And price was unbeatable as well</li>
    <li> I wouldnt buy this again. I wasnt expecting much for $15 but I at least expected the atomizer to work, It just squirts like a squirtgun just like the testers at the maill. VERY cheap bottle. Very synthetic smell. It smells like YSL Lhomme with a very synthetic vibe to it, Lhomme KILLS this fragrance, spend the extra and stick with you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> this cologne smells so good I get a lot of compliments from females when I hit the club or a local bar . and the price is so cheap at my local mall they are selling it for $65</li>
    <li> Just bought this for my sweety&#x27;s birthday and when I smelled THIS sexy scent I just knew it needed to be on his body. Ladies...beware because if your man has this on other ladies will follow! It&#x27;s a sweet and sexy scent this is soft and refreshing but strong enough to drive my hormones wild!</li>
    <li> But the design of the bottle for application is not really practical. To awdward to handle. Hard to hold the bottle and spray on.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fianc&amp;eacute; and it smells wonderful. Great deal. It was listed for $55 at Perfumania in the mall.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of this cologne...a friend recommended it to me as a gift for my son for Christmas. My son loved it&#x27;s soft scent!</li>
    <li> Fast and great quality&lt;br /&gt;Just what I expected&lt;br /&gt;Bought it for a gift and my boyfriend loved it , it was a way better price than at actual perfume stores</li>
    <li> First time using this cologne and it is worth it</li>
    <li> It did not meet my expectation in regards to the scent. Ive had this cologne previously and there is a clear difference. Therefore, I gave it away as a gift.</li>
    <li> Best Cologne ever! i got a lot compliments from very nice girl.u can&#x27;t go wrong i ll definitely recommend it to all mem who want impress with out stress ur wallet</li>
    <li> I took the risk of purchasing Unpredictable based solely on reviews. I have no regrets! I get compliments whenever I wear it! If you want to try something new or  need a gift idea, I will strongly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Great product and great smell. Retail store wanted four times the price</li>
    <li> High class smelling cologne.</li>
    <li> I smelled this fragrance at az mills and found it here for about 10 dollars cheaper. smells great. would buy again</li>
    <li> Thank you. The item came as described and shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> Good stuff on my second bottle!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is pretty good especially for a everyday or even a formal evening wearing if your kind out on the town. Its not overbaearing and it last pretty well for the day I must say. Its kind of a cross between a cologne and a vaporette type vagrance And what I mean by that is kinda like  with the cologne Farenheit..It dont smell like it mind you but it has that kinda of effect..SORTA.. But its good and I will keep it on my list as a colognes I would more than likely reorder for my everyday use again.</li>
    <li> for the price, YOU got to have this... amazing.</li>
    <li> Excellent fragrance! Shipped fast!</li>
    <li> Smells really good but wears off by the end of the night</li>
    <li> This thing smells amazing!! Some dude at work sold a 4.1 ounce to my co-worker for $50, after some research we found it was only $25. I honestly thought this would be worth over twice the amount. WILL BUY AGAIN AS GIFTS! I mean it when I say this that it made my friend (who was not into colognes) a cologne guy and gave me a nosegasm haha. Try it and I guarantee you will not be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> This is oil based so it last a while. My wife and I love the smell. This will be my second best scent.</li>
    <li> A brief blurb to place my fragrance sensibilities: I&#x27;m a middle-aged professional man, father, who enjoys a nice wardrobe, including fragrances. My collection is considerable, numbering in &#x27;several hundreds&#x27;. I enjoy anything that is well put together, smells pleasant, and has acceptable longevity. I despise cloying fragrances, especially artificial ones, cheap, synthetic &amp;#34;woods and spices&amp;#34; types (astringent old-man smells), and many &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; fragrances for lack of a better term, based on cinnamon, cardamom, amber. Things often called &amp;#34;Desire&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Night&amp;#34;. I love aquas, chypres, florals, fougeres, oudhs, attars, orientals. Good ones anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, now to Glenn Perri Unpredictable. I already wrote a review of Glenn Perri Unpredictable Night, and on the basis of that, I expected this to be a solid &amp;#34;mediocre&amp;#34;, nice but unexceptional. It is manufactured by Geparlys, the same maker that does the dismally bad Karen Low fragrances. Anyway, it does clear the bar, with room to spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance starts as a kind of fougere, a green and almost mossy top note. I thought it was nice but underwhelming. There was no distinct mid note that I picked up, but the base note is a blaring loud SOAP, a super-clean floral fragrance. When applied to fabric, it also has all-day lasting power, which is excellent. There&#x27;s a hint of a bright, crisp apple but overall it&#x27;s a svelte, rock-solid &amp;#34;staple&amp;#34; fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it EXCELLENT, or UNIQUE? Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think so. With having sampled as many fragrances as I have that&#x27;s a high bar to get over with a lot of VERY good, VERY interesting fragrances to compete with. But is it VERY GOOD? Yes, clearly so. I don&#x27;t mind saying &amp;#34;very good&amp;#34;. The only criticism I have is that it may be a bit... pedestrian. Many fragrances end up resembling this flowery, soapy smell; the king of the hill here is Creed Green Irish Tweed, and there are many other good ones I&#x27;ve tried or own, and assuredly a great many besides. This isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;synthetic GIT&amp;#34; but it is of the same ilk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was between three stars and four stars. In my ratings, three stars is &amp;#34;good, but will not replace when finished&amp;#34;; four is &amp;#34;good enough to buy another bottle if they still make it when this one is empty&amp;#34;, and five star is &amp;#34;top 25 of all, regardless of price&amp;#34;. This is somewhere between 3 and 4; when I wear it more often I&#x27;ll decide whether it&#x27;s really worth replacing. However, I&#x27;ll round up, as it is still &amp;#34;very good&amp;#34;, very solid, excellent longevity, and not as instantly forgettable as &amp;#34;Unpredictable Night&amp;#34;. So - it does still come recommended! Enjoy!own, and assuredly a great many besides.

    <li> I have 40+ colognes and this is top 5.  Because the less expensive price I wasn&#x27;t expecting to enjoy it as much, but I actually fell in love with it.  It has a very pleasant enjoyable great clean soapy (in a very good way) smell that lasts.  On top of the soapy smell, it has extra layers on top of it.  Find myself sniffing on my arms throughout the day because I love it so much.</li>
    <li> smells when comes out then goes away its has been watered down</li>
    <li> This is really sexy , absolutely beautiful. Under the radar. Very nice. 5 stars.</li>
