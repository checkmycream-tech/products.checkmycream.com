      <li>I love it because of the bottle design.  </li>

      <li>I love that I found it on here and was able to stock up on it.</li>
      <li>Keeps children&#x27;s teeth healthy.</li>

      <li>My kids love this, it is easy to get them to use this each morning - no arguments.</li>

      <li>love the unique, ingenious way it dispenses.</li>
      <li>This product (from J &amp; J ) is a great supplement specially for people and kids who are very picky.</li>
      <li>Works great and has kept the cavities away so far...</li>
      <li>I like ACT the best because of the pre measured cup in the top, it helps minimize the extent of the mess if my son drops or tips it by accident.</li>
      <li>The bottle has a built-in measuring device that is quite easy to use and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lately it seems that this product has been disappearing from the retail stores that I frequent, so it makes me happy that it is available through Amazon.</li>
      <li>It is very mild, unlike the taste of Listerine or Cepacol which no way my kids will put in their mouths</li>
      <li>It is thoughtfully designed, easy for kids to handle by themselves.</li>
      <li>Be accurate in your description.</li>
      <li>This is a great deal compared to buying it at your local store.</li>
      <li>I wanted him to enjoy the ACT bubble gum like I did as a kid.  </li>
      <li>He is very happy with it, do it everyday.</li>
      <li>The flavor is great and she loves the bottle design that lets her squeeze the pre measured rinse amount into the upper portion.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for remineralizing teeth from regular &amp;#34;wear &amp; tear.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>and I want him learning good dental hygiene at a young age.  </li>
      <li>My son loves this flavor and its super easy to pour into the cap.</li>
      <li>The taste is great, but it leaves a slightly bitter taste at the end.</li>
      <li>Cool Splash Mint, 18-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)]] and the Act Restoring Treatment mouthwash.  </li>
      <li>Not too minty and not too sweet.</li>
      <li>Instill good oral hygiene in your children now and it will last a lifetime!</li>
      <li>Too cool.</li>
      <li>I know the bottle says kids but the extra flouride is good for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is mild and tastey.</li>
      <li>This bubble gum flavored mouth wash is a great incentive for getting my little girl to brush.  </li>
      <li>I care about getting this product economically and like to always have a supply at home and in the office.</li>
      <li>She LOVES this stuff, which means she actually does it on her own without needing to be reminded.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Negative: I wish they made them in a bigger size but can&#x27;t honestly take off any stars for that.</li>
      <li>This is rare on amazon--I&#x27;d like it to be non-existent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Using it is easy -- just swish around the 10 ml in your mouth for one minute once a day immediately after normal brushing.  </li>
      <li>I also know he is using the right amount with the built in cup.</li>
      <li>My kids love this, which makes them use it more often &amp; that means less cavities.  </li>
      <li>When I got braces as an adult, my orthodontist strongly recommended that his patients with orthodontia use ACT.  </li>
      <li>so I think this is really helping!</li>
      <li>However, I wouldn&#x27;t pay more to get a different flavor -</li>
      <li>I really like the auto-fill dispenser.</li>
      <li>they only want this specific kind.</li>
      <li>It is normally the most expensive brand in the grocery store, but on Amazon it is as good as the generic brands that don&#x27;t have a measuring cup</li>
      <li>The less I have to carry up there the better.</li>
      <li>We didn&#x27;t experience that particular issue</li>
      <li>My dental hygienist recommended ACT to me, particularly since we have well water (no fluoride.)  </li>
      <li>Colgate&#x27;s Phos Flur, a competing product I&#x27;ve used extensively, has a thicker, more medical consistency and works well.</li>
      <li>When we do mouthwash, my 5 years old son wants do it himself.</li>
      <li>(I had not used mouth wash previously) and she is willing to use this, which is saying something as she&#x27;s super picky.</li>
      <li>My 3 yr old son loves this!</li>
      <li>Consistent use and another check up six months later proved that he no longer had cavity forming activity on that spot.  </li>
      <li>The lack of fluoride-based toothpaste, mouthwash and drinking water is evident in the mouths of every Japanese person.</li>
      <li>Whereas I&#x27;m not too particular about the flavors, bubble gum is probably my least favorite.  </li>
      <li>Got this for my 8 year old daughter, who managed to hold the Listerine flouride mouthwash in her mouth for about .3 seconds before spitting it all over the bathroom mirror.  </li>
      <li>so my 8 year old could use it as well.  </li>
      <li>And bonus is that if he squeezes too much it automatically goes back in!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered this to supplement my brushing here in Japan where fluoride products are not readily available. The lack of fluoride-based toothpaste, mouthwash and drinking water is evident in the mouths of every Japanese person. After using this mouthwash I have already noticed three sensitive spots on my teeth are not sensitive or noticeable at all. I was surprised by this since I didn&#x27;t even consider that this mouthwash would do anything about that. All-in-all a great product...and not just for kids!</li>
    <li> I am not to afraid of him swalling this mouthwash, and it does not burn delicate mouths. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I like to switch back &amp; forth between this [[ASIN:B001MIZMJS ACT Restoring Mouthwash, Cool Splash Mint, 18-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)]] and the Act Restoring Treatment mouthwash.  (Tastes real good too!!)  They are BOTH GREAT &amp; much more AFFORDABLE here at Amazon.com!!</li>
    <li> This bubble gum flavored mouth wash is a great incentive for getting my little girl to brush.  She knows that she only gets to rinse after she brushes.  The flavor is great and she loves the bottle design that lets her squeeze the pre measured rinse amount into the upper portion.  Her dentist also says that it&#x27;s a great way to add fluoride since she doesn&#x27;t drink much of our fluoridated tap water.</li>
    <li> Two out of my three kids are extremely picky when it comes to toothpaste flavors, etc..I&#x27;ve only ever found one brand and flavor they will use without complaint.  So I was nervous when we decided to start using a rinse/mouthwash and was very happy to find that even they like this one.  It has a good amount of flouride and is alcohol free so there is no pain or burning. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> My 3 yr old son loves this! He is a big boy and can squeeze it into the cup himself. (: And bonus is that if he squeezes too much it automatically goes back in! Too cool. This is a must everynight before the ritual of teet brushing.... I put a little flip hour glass sand timer on the sink to make sure we do it long enough. Great product, FABULOUS price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Got this for my 8 year old daughter, who managed to hold the Listerine flouride mouthwash in her mouth for about .3 seconds before spitting it all over the bathroom mirror.  She LOVES this stuff, which means she actually does it on her own without needing to be reminded. One word of warning: it has no safety cap, so a toddler can open it and drink away.  If you have little kids in the house, keep it out of reach!</li>
    <li> My son is 5 1/2 now and I want him learning good dental hygiene at a young age.  I used to use ACT as a kid and now that he understand to swish swish swish for 30 seconds and then spit it out I wanted him to enjoy the ACT bubble gum like I did as a kid.  The smell and taste is just like I remember it.  Buying on here with the Subscribe and Save and getting 4 bottles shipped right to your door is a good price and ultra convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I considered the sponge bob one on here as well but I have read TOO many stories of kids and parents alike not liking the flavor.  Do yourself and your child a favor and get this flavor.  It cannot be beat, trust me.  Instill good oral hygiene in your children now and it will last a lifetime!</li>
    <li> Most toothpaste today already contains fluoride. This product (from J &amp; J ) is a great supplement specially for people and kids who are very picky. The taste is very pleasant. Not too minty and not too sweet. It is very mild, unlike the taste of Listerine or Cepacol which no way my kids will put in their mouths -this is not a mouthwash by the way; just a fluoride supplement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the unique, ingenious way it dispenses. You squeeze the bottle and it comes up on the top of the bottle which has a small receptacle and is just enough fill for a gargle.</li>
    <li> Using this as an older adult with tooth pain due to loss of enamel. Colgate&#x27;s Phos Flur, a competing product I&#x27;ve used extensively, has a thicker, more medical consistency and works well. This ACT product does not seem to penetrate the enamel quite as well (measured by duration of pain relief) but it does work. And it costs one-third the price of the Colgate product. Pleasant not-overpowering taste, something like Kool-Aid (PhosFlur has a mild more medicinal taste). Overall, after two weeks of daily use, I&#x27;d recommend this ACT series of products as a useful, affordable adjunct to oral health. I understand ACT now offers a Sensitive or mild-tasting solution for Adults, which I will try next. My suggestion to ACT is that they go with natural fruit flavors, citrus or pomegranate esp., to give the product a healthier, less-sweet taste.</li>
    <li> Keeps children&#x27;s teeth healthy. Kids love yhe taste and its a great way to continue awesome oral health for children</li>
    <li> Years ago my dentist recommended this product.  I like the subscription deal and the fact that I can get a supply of 4 bottles all at once.      Whereas I&#x27;m not too particular about the flavors, bubble gum is probably my least favorite.  However, I wouldn&#x27;t pay more to get a different flavor - that&#x27;s just my personal preference. I care about getting this product economically and like to always have a supply at home and in the office.</li>
    <li> We have gone through various mouthwashes and this is the only one so far that gets the 8 year old thumbs up.  And mom likes it since it is anti-cavity with fluoride and no alcohol.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this as he said the flouride was just what i needed to help protect the enamel in my teeth. This has now become a staple in my routine. I know the bottle says kids but the extra flouride is good for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as a bonus, it tastes amazing. but don&#x27;t drink it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative: I wish they made them in a bigger size but can&#x27;t honestly take off any stars for that.</li>
    <li> When I got braces as an adult, my orthodontist strongly recommended that his patients with orthodontia use ACT.  I took his advice and presume that it is doing some good.  I intend to continue using this product after I get my braces off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, it is not possible for me to judge whether it is helping strengthen my teeth, but I presume that it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it is easy -- just swish around the 10 ml in your mouth for one minute once a day immediately after normal brushing.  The bottle has a built-in measuring device that is quite easy to use and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tastes quite pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this bubble gum flavor solely because, for whatever reason, it is the least expensive.</li>
    <li> Love it! This is a great deal compared to buying it at your local store. My son loves this flavor and its super easy to pour into the cap. It&#x27;s very clean.</li>
    <li> Love the ease of use of this product. The design of the bottle is awesome and so is the flavor. I am an adult but cannot handle the overly minty mouthwashes and this is perfect for adults and children alike.</li>
    <li> The taste is great, but it leaves a slightly bitter taste at the end. It&#x27;s a bit annoying, but not a dealbreaker.</li>
    <li> ACT bubble gum flavored wah is my kids favorite they only want this specific kind.It is mild and tastey. I wish they liked mint mouthwash as this one doesn&#x27;t make their breath sell that good.</li>
    <li> My kids love this, it is easy to get them to use this each morning - no arguments. I tried it too, and it is a very light taste that doesn&#x27;t linger and I will be buying more. Works great and has kept the cavities away so far...</li>
    <li> I like ACT the best because of the pre measured cup in the top, it helps minimize the extent of the mess if my son drops or tips it by accident. I also know he is using the right amount with the built in cup. My son likes the flavor of ACT bubble gum fluoride mouthwash the best. It is normally the most expensive brand in the grocery store, but on Amazon it is as good as the generic brands that don&#x27;t have a measuring cup and my son says taste gross.</li>
    <li> My 4-year-old loves having his own mouthwash like mommy and daddy! I used this when I was a kid, and I remember loving the squeeze top-cup. He loves it too, and doesn&#x27;t need my help with it at all, since it is spill proof! I love that I found it on here and was able to stock up on it. I wont need to buy more for awhile.</li>
    <li> The kids have been using this for about 6 months or so. They don&#x27;t seem to have any problems with the taste. I really like the auto-fill dispenser.</li>
    <li> The product, itself, is excellent, but I do not like misrepresentation. This is rare on amazon--I&#x27;d like it to be non-existent. Be accurate in your description.</li>
    <li> The ACT Anticavity Fluoride Mouthwash has its perks...I used to swish with Listerine (tartar control) mouthwash, however as of recent ACT Mouthwash has been the substance of choice..</li>
    <li> My kids love using this mouthwash and it seems to do a great job taking care of anything missed during brushing.  I used to buy Listerine SmartRinse but read reviews on here (and then Googled it) about it staining kids&#x27; teeth brown.  We didn&#x27;t experience that particular issue but I wasn&#x27;t about to keep using it to see for ourselves.  Incidentally, my kids like the taste of this much better than the SmartRinse so it worked out perfectly.</li>
    <li> This fluoride rinse is my favorite, having a great taste and aftertaste that does not bother me. This is important for me as my dental hygienist said it was very important to not even drink WATER for an hour after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately it seems that this product has been disappearing from the retail stores that I frequent, so it makes me happy that it is available through Amazon.</li>
    <li> If you are able to get these in a bundle with free shipping it is so much better than getting them at the store. They are heavy (I&#x27;m a third floor inhabitant with a two year old...) The less I have to carry up there the better. Came nicely packaged and is a great great item to have for youngins that are learning the value of clean teeth and gums :)</li>
    <li> When we do mouthwash, my 5 years old son wants do it himself. I am happy to find mouthwash for kids. He is very happy with it, do it everyday. It is thoughtfully designed, easy for kids to handle by themselves.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a kid, but I prefer a fluoride rinse without alcohol, and this is the perfect product for me. Several fluoride rinses from other brands contain things that can cause surface staining, but ACT doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> My daughter likes it. Squeezes and there is a stop so it does not spill. What else can you say about mouthwash people. Oh, it was cheaper than the store and I didn&#x27;t have to waste time shopping for it at the store.</li>
    <li> for a product recommended to our adult son by our dentist.  Our adult son reports that he had a soft spot forming on a tooth.  Consistent use and another check up six months later proved that he no longer had cavity forming activity on that spot.  There was enough in this offering (four bottles) so that the whole family can reap the benefits.</li>
    <li> My 6yr old loves this mouthwash.  It is bubblegum flavor, and the bottle is designed that he can use it himself.  He squeezes the bottle and the mouthwash comes up into a little measuring cup.... there&#x27;s literally no way to spill the bottle because of this design!  I usually try to only use all-natural artificial coloring-free products, but he excitedly uses this every day and since he isn&#x27;t digesting it I think its okay.  His past dental check-up he had zero cavities; before he used this daily he did get some cavities-- so I think this is really helping!</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended ACT to me, particularly since we have well water (no fluoride.)  I initially bought the &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34; version (cinnamon) but ended up just buying this bundle so my 8 year old could use it as well.  It is nice that the correct amount is dispenses, and the flavor is fine.  Since it contains fluoride, I definitely recommend keeping it locked up so children cannot access it without adult help.</li>
    <li> My kids love the taste of this mouthwash.  I love it because of the bottle design.  They have to squeeze it to fill a reservoir  with the amount they need.  There is a lot less mess with this than other bottles where they have to pour it into the cup.</li>
    <li> I love the flavor of this mouthwash. My kids don&#x27;t use it, so I do. It smells great and works great.</li>
    <li> Kids love the taste as opposed to the burning sensation of mint flavored mouthwashes and my children love being able to dispense it themselves.</li>
    <li> My daughter likes it which means she will use it without me needing to get on to her which means I like it.</li>
    <li> I have to use non alcohol rinse, and the ACT Kids Anticavity Fluoride Mouthwash is the most cost efficient way to buy it. With the larger sizes, you have to use twice as much per rinse to get the same amount of fluoride. The first time I used it, I was a bit put off by the bubble gum flavor, but no rinse tastes good anyway, and I don&#x27;t even notice the flavor any more.</li>
    <li> She has cavities so we are fighting them with fluoride (I had not used mouth wash previously) and she is willing to use this, which is saying something as she&#x27;s super picky.</li>
    <li> My kids love this, which makes them use it more often &amp; that means less cavities.  I use it as well.  It&#x27;s great for remineralizing teeth from regular &amp;#34;wear &amp; tear.&amp;#34;</li>
