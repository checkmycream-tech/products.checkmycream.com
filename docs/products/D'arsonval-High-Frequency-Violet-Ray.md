      <li>if you tap a white head with it it helps you be able to pop it more effortlessly as it almost puts micro holes into your skin; as gross as that sounds.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a design flaw and they are trying to make me spend more money to buy a different model.  </li>
      <li>There is a gap in the handle that allows electrical bleed-through, which affects how strong the current is coming from the electrode.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was fast.</li>

      <li>First I commend the customer service people for getting back with me so quickly.  </li>
      <li>Not only does it get rid of brown spots but it also has significantly reduced the wrinkles on my forehead and the crows feet by my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Item does have a smell when turned on and in use, but is completely normal due to the static charge produced.</li>
      <li>The setting does doesn&#x27;t go low enough to be able to use under and around the eyes.</li>
      <li>THE D&#x27;ARSONVAL WITH, WAS A HIGH END PROFESSIONAL EQUIPMENT,VERY COSTLY, AVAILABLE ONLY TO SPECIALIZED BUSINESSES, AND IT IS NOT FAIR.&lt;br /&gt;FOR</li>

      <li>I love this item and use it all the time..like everyday.  </li>
      <li>THE REALLY LOW PRICE OF THE D&#x27;ARSONVAL IS A VERY REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE, AND I AM PLANNING TO USE IT FOR BOTH AGE SPOTS AND HAIR TREATMENT</li>

      <li>Instructions look like they were written by a three year old.</li>
      <li>Too early to tell yet.</li>
      <li>I really like this for my overall skin appearance of my skin, i would recommend very short but thorough sessions every day then</li>

<li> eventually every other day as this is something that helps your skin by the third or fourth week.</li>

<li> I guess that will have to give a little time too.  </li>

<li> (ALSO I WAS USING THE WRONG ELECTRODE, AS I SHOULD HAVE USED THE ONE SIMILAR TO A COMB INSTEAD OF THE ONE I USED WITH A SMALL BALL</li>
<li> we&#x27;ll see the results in a few weeks !!</li>
<li> Veryyy weak just not a very good buu</li>
<li> you can get a real nasty shock if you touch a dead bulb near ish to the machine the bulb wont shock you though.</li>
<li> Arrived on time with 2 probes broken.  </li>
<li> Just ridiculous!</li>
<li> I was disappointed to find the ray never reached &amp;#34;violet&amp;#34;, as advertised; not sure if this is defective or not, please comment.</li>
<li> Not impressed at all with this.  </li>
<li> AT THE END.&lt;br /&gt;i am sorry for the wrong rating, and ask the provider to forgive me.&lt;br /&gt;WILL</li>
<li> kept getting shocked alot</li>
<li> was quite disappointed!</li>
<li> Terrible instructions but the product works</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Arrived on time with 2 probes broken.  Also this is not the &amp;#34;violet ray,&amp;#34; as advertised.  The probes that were not broken light up orange, which indicates that they are filled with Neon gas, not Argon, which would glow with the Violet Ray.  It&#x27;s heading back for a refund.</li>
    <li> Terrible instructions but the product works</li>
    <li> While the machine itself seems to work well. I had ordered a violet ray and it is definitely orange. I&#x27;m giving this unit to my sister and purchasing a violet ray elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Item arrived as descriped. Shipped quickly.  Works great. Item does have a smell when turned on and in use, but is completely normal due to the static charge produced. As good as the higher priced equivalent brands, but at a much better price!!</li>
    <li> Work great for firing detoxing tissue in my massage practice.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast. Product arrived in great shape. Product seemed to be good quality first couple times of using worked great. Last time I used it .. It was power surging .. I&#x27;d adjust power and put it back to the setting I had it one and it would be fine .. Then it would surge again.. I check that all connections were OK and couldn&#x27;t find a problem.hmmmm.. Now some after some time I go to use it .. Plug it in choose the attachment I wanted and now it doesn&#x27;t work.  Tried all the attachment none work . buy at your own rosk</li>
    <li> I researched this product before I purchased it. It has lived up to all of my expectations. My skin is softer and it has helped with darkness around my eyes.</li>
    <li> it refreshes my skin relaxes leaves my skin soft and illuminating it&#x27;s comfortable and easy to use leaves face clear takes away the looks of tirenness</li>
    <li> Great product , easy to use!  I got it for me and my mom to work on her sun spots and thinning hair we&#x27;ll see the results in a few weeks !!</li>
    <li> The item came defective and I still waiting for a refund.</li>
    <li> This has done wonders for varicose veins. Trying it for thicker hair and also wrinkles. Too early to tell yet. But works well, and arrived quickly. Lights up with the violet color. At the price, well worth a shot. Do treat carefully though. It is glass after all!</li>
    <li> First I commend the customer service people for getting back with me so quickly.  They wrote several times and worked out my problem. I like the unit and it seems to be doing a good job on making my hair follicles strong.  I bought it because my hair was getting thinner, but this makes it strong again.  I don&#x27;t know about lightening age spots yet.  I guess that will have to give a little time too.  Overall, happy.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the device, takes some getting used to.</li>
    <li> in process of trying to return product, not what I expected</li>
    <li> Veryyy weak just not a very good buu it needs a lot more power you really can nearly feel it.</li>
    <li> Does so much more than you would expect.  At 33 I have tried everything for my acne, this is the only thing that worked.  I can go weeks at a time without using it and my face stays clear.  Simply Amazing product!!</li>
    <li> kept getting shocked alot</li>
    <li> I really like this for my overall skin appearance of my skin, i would recommend very short but thorough sessions every day then eventually every other day as this is something that helps your skin by the third or fourth week. if you tap a white head with it it helps you be able to pop it more effortlessly as it almost puts micro holes into your skin; as gross as that sounds. i definitely prefer this over a &amp;#34;derma-roller&amp;#34; cause those needles hurt and make me bleed. I&#x27;ve only been using this for about 3 weeks now about every other day. This tools is great for people who like to pick at your pimples as this tool gives you weapon to unleash your wrath on those obnoxious blemish&#x27;s in a less scarring/damaging way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as i love this tool I would not trust to leave this tool plugged in when not in use. It&#x27;s good to do that with anything your not using anyways...</li>
    <li> This product seems to be less than its&#x27; competitors. Actual demonstration to see online might have swayed my decision to purchase.</li>
    <li> For the money it is the best value. I love it as a starter wand. It will be a nice toy</li>
    <li> This is a very good device especially for the price it works as well as the one I received treatments from the cosmetology school . I have recommended to family and friends. Thanks!</li>
    <li> tHE PRODUCT IS REALLY A \\&quot;HIGH FREQUENCY\\&quot; DEVICE, NOT REALLY AN \\&quot;ULTRAVIOLET EAY\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WANT TO RECONSIDER MY REVIEW, BECAUSE THE PRODUCT I WAS COMPARING THE D&#x27;ARSONVAL WITH, WAS A HIGH END PROFESSIONAL EQUIPMENT,VERY COSTLY, AVAILABLE ONLY TO SPECIALIZED BUSINESSES, AND IT IS NOT FAIR.&lt;br /&gt;FOR THE REALLY LOW PRICE OF THE D&#x27;ARSONVAL IS A VERY REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE, AND I AM PLANNING TO USE IT FOR BOTH AGE SPOTS AND HAIR TREATMENT (ALSO I WAS USING THE WRONG ELECTRODE, AS I SHOULD HAVE USED THE ONE SIMILAR TO A COMB INSTEAD OF THE ONE I USED WITH A SMALL BALL AT THE END.&lt;br /&gt;i am sorry for the wrong rating, and ask the provider to forgive me.&lt;br /&gt;WILL KEEP INFORMED TATOO CO OF THE PROGRESS OS THE AGE SPOT TREATMENT&lt;br /&gt;ROLANDO GARCIA-LAGO</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations, as it was packed with I nice, useful, padded carrying case.  It works resoundingly well for treating skin conditions as well as for experimental play.  Would highly recommend it as a great, inexpensive, 110V solution.</li>
    <li> the product worked fine but one of the bulbs did not work and when I contacted the seller about the issue I never got a reply. so if you want to gamble on whether or not you will get a fully functioning set be my guest.  and one side note you can get a real nasty shock if you touch a dead bulb near ish to the machine the bulb wont shock you though.</li>
    <li> I have used this device morning and night for over 6 weeks. I had hoped that it would help with my acne, minimize pores, help with stretch marks and beautify my skin overall.  Nothing happened.  I used this product properly and for enough time each session. Not only was it ineffective, but one the glass attachments came out of the wand, leaving the metal connector stuck inside, so now it is broken. I have no motivation to fix it, however, because the violet ray did nothing at all for my skin.  I suspect that some of the positive reviews for this product were written by consumers who haven&#x27;t used this product very long and with high hopes have imagined seeing good results (placebo effect); just a guess, because I thought good things were happening the first few days too.</li>
    <li> Ordered the violet ray received the orange one.</li>
    <li> works well. nice and when i bought it was for a steal.  they are usually more expensive than what i got it for but it comew with everything. and it light up purple. great for skin. follow the rules to the letter. it will last forever that way. i like it.</li>
    <li> The device did not meet my expectations because the surface of the round attachment was extremely small.&lt;br /&gt;I was quite disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love this item and use it all the time..like everyday.  It has helped me get rid of all the brown spots on my face from suffering from melasma for years.  Not only does it get rid of brown spots but it also has significantly reduced the wrinkles on my forehead and the crows feet by my eyes.  It also helps get rid of any bags under your eyes and tightening up your skin.</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> An amazing device. You&#x27;ll be surprised what it can do. Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Great item, for our first</li>
    <li> Not impressed at all with this.  The setting does doesn&#x27;t go low enough to be able to use under and around the eyes. I have another one that  goes much lower and doesn&#x27;t feel like your getting shocked when you use it.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to find the ray never reached &amp;#34;violet&amp;#34;, as advertised; not sure if this is defective or not, please comment. Furthermore it is not the name brand as advertised, this merely says on the box cover PORTABLE HIGH FREQUENCY 08A.  The name brand is no place on the instrument or on the literature. I would like to have the product as advertised &amp;#34;D&#x27;ARSONVAL VIOLET RAY&amp;#34; and it would probably illuminate a violet ray, not orange.</li>
    <li> This device burned my face.  The first two times I used this, on the lowest setting, there was some tingling and a shock but no redness.  The next time, I turned it up just above the lowest setting and it burned my face.  It&#x27;s like a severe sunburn, red, peeling, very sore and tight feeling.  After 3 days it&#x27;s finally healing.  Do not use this without extreme caution.</li>
    <li> I got this to use for my scalp to help my hair grow. Its not strong enough. You cant even feel it working. the only place i would use it is on your skin but even there You can barely feel it on your skin. I just wouldnt recommend this product especially for hair growth purposes.</li>
    <li> This product was received damaged. When it is replaced, I will give a second review.</li>
    <li> No Power - Does not function like a Violet Wand is supposed to do.  Spend more money and get a real Violet Wand. I did.</li>
    <li> A piece of junk. Doesn&#x27;t do anything. Instructions look like they were written by a three year old.</li>
    <li> There is a gap in the handle that allows electrical bleed-through, which affects how strong the current is coming from the electrode.  If I move my hand down towards the cord, I get an electric shock from the dial.  The seller is a huge PITA regarding the return.  I told them it&#x27;s not defective, it&#x27;s a design flaw and they are trying to make me spend more money to buy a different model.  Having to get Amazon involved.  Just ridiculous!</li>
    <li> Love this high frequency device.  Super easy to use and love all the attachments.</li>
    <li> This product is powerful.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s making a difference on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is not a sex toy. The zap isn&#x27;t so strong. It does however have microdermabrasion abilities.</li>
