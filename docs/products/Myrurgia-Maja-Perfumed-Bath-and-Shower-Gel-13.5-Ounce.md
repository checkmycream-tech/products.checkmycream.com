### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is an excellent product</li>
      <li>Best stuff.</li>
      <li>For those who like your woman to smell great, this is the perfect product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the soap and think the bath gel/foam is excellent.</li>
      <li>BUT it&#x27;s still pleasant.</li>
      <li>gel and the lotion are an amazing combination . . .</li>
      <li>Does it have shea butter in it or any kind of moisturizer?</li>
      <li>I am a fan of the Maja soap and was pleased to find it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I can get it on line.  </li>
      <li>It is the best and only shower soap I will use.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ridiculus to have to have so many letters.</li>
      <li>Try to find the authentic product in person because imitators have flooded Amazon.</li>
      <li>It was pretty good.  </li>
      <li>I like this very much because it has a warm and spicy fragrance that can be used by males or females.</li>
      <li>However, I got caught up in the moment with the\\&quot;$25.00 free S&amp;H\\&quot; offer and did not compare pictures.</li>
      <li>Now this shower gel smells wonderful but the myrugia round soaps smell like coal tar</li>
      <li>IMO, the original scent is almost unisex.</li>
      <li>12/12 Originally I didn&#x27;t like the scent, but after using it, I&#x27;ve come to like it.</li>
      <li>It does not smell anything like the original.  </li>
      <li>This is not the original.  </li>
      <li>Spicy and fresh!  </li>
      <li>I am familiar with this</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the original that I wanted</li>
      <li>It is a nice change of pace from my other favorite fragrances/shower gels.</li>
      <li>I might try to add some essential oil scents of my own to tone the rose/loud scent.</li>
      <li>Smells great but does not lather as much as I had expected.</li>
      <li>Not crazy about this scent.</li>
      <li>Another warning, many of the products showing the original design will say &amp;#34;Product shipped may be different than that shown.&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Smells wonderful, holds it&#x27;s scent for a few hours, so hubby can enjoy it too, if you know what I mean.  </li>
      <li>perfumed bath/shower gel really is off the mark.</li>
      <li>About 4 years ago I could buy the original gel at Ross or Marshall&#x27;s for only $6.99.</li>
      <li>wont be re ordering this particular product as in the bath/shower gel.</li>
      <li>THEY WILL NOT TAKE IT BACK, BUT WILL REPLACE WITH MORE OF THE SAME!</li>
      <li>I live in Alaska, and the original (see the other bottle design) cannot be shipped to me.  </li>
      <li>I have ever use, leaving your skin soft too!</li>
      <li>double check all the details that what I&#x27;m ordering is what I really want.</li>
      <li>So soft and feminine.</li>
      <li>Recently while searching for the soap, I came across the bath and shower gel and it smells just as good as the soap, with less waste.</li>
      <li>You smell  CLEAN  after using it AND  different of other  soaps  </li>
      <li>Does not dry my skin and cause itching as some soaps have.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It does not make a lot of foam !</li>
    <li> CAUTION:  YOU WILL RECEIVE MAJA ESPANA, NOT MYRURGIA!  VERY DIFFERENT!  THEY WILL NOT TAKE IT BACK, BUT WILL REPLACE WITH MORE OF THE SAME!</li>
    <li> You smell  CLEAN  after using it AND  different of other  soaps  I have ever use, leaving your skin soft too!</li>
    <li> It was pretty good.  The fragrance did not last and it was not as moist to my skin.  Does it have shea butter in it or any kind of moisturizer?</li>
    <li> I am familiar with this product.&lt;br /&gt;The gel and the lotion are an amazing combination . . . they enhance each other!</li>
    <li> Sadly I had to throw away most of this shower gel. It smells divine and does the job. Unfortunately I check the ingredients. Let&#x27;s face it: it you can&#x27;t pronounce it you don&#x27;t wanting it in or on your body.&lt;br /&gt;Really I dislike all of the sulfates listed. Along with the the unpronounceable additives. I even read them in English.</li>
    <li> It is a nice change of pace from my other favorite fragrances/shower gels. I also have the EDT and change it off with Bath &amp; Body Works Sea Island Cotton body spray, cream and butter.</li>
    <li> It is the best and only shower soap I will use.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product</li>
    <li> Looked for this stuff for years! Finally found it.</li>
    <li> Warning:  This is not the original.  It does not smell anything like the original.  This is made in Mexico...I live in Alaska, and the original (see the other bottle design) cannot be shipped to me.  Another warning, many of the products showing the original design will say &amp;#34;Product shipped may be different than that shown.&amp;#34;. Buyer be cautious.  Try to find the authentic product in person because imitators have flooded Amazon.</li>
    <li> Now this shower gel smells wonderful but the myrugia round soaps smell like coal tar</li>
    <li> Not crazy about this scent.</li>
    <li> This is MYRURGIA MAJA Shower Gel  - NOT - Maja BY Myrurgia! Little did I think that the difference in wording would produce 2 different products.  BUT if I had double checked that picture, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have made this mistake. I wanted the shower gel with the flamenco dancer on the label. However, I got caught up in the moment with the\\&quot;$25.00 free S&amp;H\\&quot; offer and did not compare pictures. UPDATE: 12/12 Originally I didn&#x27;t like the scent, but after using it, I&#x27;ve come to like it. It&#x27;s not the original that I wanted BUT it&#x27;s still pleasant. Lesson learned here: double check all the details that what I&#x27;m ordering is what I really want. PS: About 4 years ago I could buy the original gel at Ross or Marshall&#x27;s for only $6.99. If only I had had a crystal ball!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the soap and think the bath gel/foam is excellent.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;ve used it for years.  It&#x27;s hard to find in the stores.  I&#x27;m glad I can get it on line.  It&#x27;s ridiculus to have to have so many letters.</li>
    <li> For those who like your woman to smell great, this is the perfect product. Also can be used alternately with Maja soap.&lt;br /&gt;I found the soap while on a trip to Spain almost two decades ago and my wife has been using it since. Recently while searching for the soap, I came across the bath and shower gel and it smells just as good as the soap, with less waste.</li>
    <li> Smells great but does not lather as much as I had expected.</li>
    <li> Spicy and fresh!  I like this very much because it has a warm and spicy fragrance that can be used by males or females.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of the Maja soap and was pleased to find it. I initially discovered the scent in the mid 1950&#x27;s as my grandparents used  the soap/powder.&lt;br /&gt;THIS perfumed bath/shower gel really is off the mark. I find it way to rose/sweet. IMO, the original scent is almost unisex. I wont be re ordering this particular product as in the bath/shower gel. I might try to add some essential oil scents of my own to tone the rose/loud scent.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, holds it&#x27;s scent for a few hours, so hubby can enjoy it too, if you know what I mean.  Does not dry my skin and cause itching as some soaps have.</li>
    <li> Best stuff. So soft and feminine.</li>
