<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have very fine hair and this works well for me.  Received this item in just a few days in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased this product through my beautician in the past for twice as much.  This product is the same formula that I have been using for many years and is excellent. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> If you have fine hair, you have to try this shampoo and conditioner. It does not weigh your hair down!</li>
    <li> Love it.  The set made my hair so soft and beautiful.  Thank youj</li>
    <li> I just got the package in the mail today.  The color of the Shampoo and the Conditioner is different from the one I bought and a beauty shop and one of the pumps don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Not really sure - but it does not look like the same product I used in Germany and Italy....  Overall is OK but very overpriced for just OK. Would not order again.  Wella products are much better.</li>
    <li> Great price fast delivery ! I would purchase again through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am new in Amazon and this is the first product that I bought here. I got a great product for less of his regular value and the best thing is that I received it the day after I placed the order....can i ask for something else? Amazon you are the best!</li>
    <li> I have used Schwarzkopf shampoo and conditioner before which I loved, with this current purchase I am incredibly disappointed.  I used the products twice but will be returning them.  First - they smell like weird old woman potpourri or something.  After getting out of the shower I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling that awful smell all day.  Second - my hair felt awful.  I thought this would be like the other Schwarzkopf I&#x27;ve used which made my hair feel silky, smooth and shiny.  This was a total bust.  Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> Counterfeit Alert!!!!</li>
    <li> Great value for a great product.  My favorite shampoo and conditioner.  Very we&#x27;ll packaged and arrived quickly.  Can&#x27;t beat the price for the set, which also included the pumps and a carry-all bag!</li>
    <li> Q10 is the best and this shampoo suds up enough to get your hair clean</li>
    <li> Excellent product for my aging hair.  The price is very reasonable and I like the pump that comes with the bottle.</li>
    <li> The bottles in the picture don&#x27;t look anything like he product that I received.  If I would have received the bottles shown, I would rate it a 5.  I don&#x27;t know if there are different versions of this shampoo and conditioner but what I got is no where near the quality of product that I received when I ordered it in January.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is excellent as is the conditioner, highly recommend both. In addition I use a keep in conditioner which makes hair shinny!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  Hair is silky and smooth.  The price is the best I have found anywhere.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So far so good has a great smell and can see and feel my hair getting stronger.  Was experiencing soft but light and fly away hair that appeared thinner to the touch.  Its soft as usual but has more body great purchase</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner not only makes mt hair soft and shiny but also smells great. A little bit goes a long way too so you don&#x27;t run out for awhile. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this pair of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner ever! Hard to find in the small town I live in now so I was very happy to find it at a decent price online!</li>
    <li> My mom was using this shampoo and I tried it while visiting her. I could not believe the difference it made in my hair. My hair is now soft and shiny and it smells like vanilla, and that vanilla smell lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to find that I could purchase it through Amazon and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I recently started using this product it was recommended to me, by a hair stylist since I have thin hair. I noticed a reduccion in loosing my hair after a week of using it. So far I am content with the results but I need to give it a little more time to see a dramatic change. I do like the texture of my hair after I wash it, the smell of the products is nice.</li>
    <li> Makes feel wonderfully soft and leaves hair with a light pleasent scent.</li>
    <li> Love it. Leaves hair feeling smooth and healthy. Less hair loss as well.</li>
    <li> Wonderful products.  Brought my hair back to life.  I will continue to keep using it.</li>
    <li> Schwarzkopf is better than any shampoo and conditioner that I used before.&lt;br /&gt;Really professional.&lt;br /&gt;I feel my hair like silk.</li>
    <li> Alright, I just got these products in the mail and I was very happy but I was reading before I use them... a little bit too late! But the ones I got, you can actually peel off the instructions :(&lt;br /&gt;can anybody tell me, is this fake?  I can&#x27;t try it and waste my money on some fake products. My hair is very dry and my scalp but I have a lot of hair. Should I return it? If so anybody knows where I could buy it, a beauty salon ?&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care how much it costs.&lt;br /&gt;Please and thank you!</li>
    <li> I do really, really like the fragrance.  The performance/result seems average.  I have salt&amp; pepper hair, and the gray hairs are dry.  I did not see a difference in dryness or manageability after use.  For me, the product fell short of it&#x27;s claims.  If the wonderful fragrance was wed to wonderful results I would be thrilled.  The bottles are large and cumbersome without a pump.  A customer posted the ingredients listed is like a chemical stew and that seems accurate.  I will not be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> Most all of my friends use this shampoo, and I got a good deal; $19 a pair on here (Amazon) while it&#x27;s $55 in general. Very quick free shipping 2. And my friend told me that this shappoo also help for her hair to grow.</li>
    <li> Too dry but better than nothing</li>
    <li> I bought it for my dyed hair which is falling a lot. this product just like other regular shampoo. Too pricy for what it worth</li>
    <li> Wow, reasonable price for a salon-quality duo that does exactly what it says it will do. My hair has seldom looked better, and I do notice thinning at my age. This seems to keep the scalp fresh and my hair is shiny, bouncy, happy.</li>
    <li> A pump was sent with one of them but only the top of the pump was sent with no canula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I later found the canula and it is okay now.....no problems</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo for years now and I never buy it from anywhere other than Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love Schwarzkopf products.  There really is a difference in professional products and over the counter products.  I highly recommend this for people who need to refresh their dry dull hair.  Especially if you have long hair!</li>
    <li> I LOVE Schwarzkopf hair products.  I think they are a quality brand that has been time tested, and proven superior for many years.  I have tried tons of other brands, but will always go back to Schwarzkopf.  They truly feel like they nourish, soften and strengthen your hair.</li>
    <li> Came on time. Keeps my hair feeling healthy, helps it grow, allows for my highlights to last longer!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for over a year now and have zero complaints.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect solution to my damaged hair! I have a very damaged highlighted hair, and this shampoo and conditioner recover brights and softness to my hair! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is the best value for this product.  It smells wonderful as well as working as advertised.</li>
    <li> Great product.  The only issue was the pumps that came with the shampoo and conditioner.  One was broken and would have never fit and the other one did not fit the bottles.  Their products are great, though.  Would recommend.  I only gave it 4 stars because of the packaging and pumps.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I have used for a long time. Smells great, does not strip color, and leaves hair very soft.</li>
    <li> I truly recomment the product/. Other than smells good it really helps restore your hair. Try it you&#x27;ll love it</li>
    <li> This product is 100% fake. It&#x27;s obvious even from looking at the bottle that it&#x27;s not that same product I&#x27;ve been using for the past year.</li>
    <li> Got out of the shower after using this and my back was stinging! I looked at the ingredients and no wonder! It&#x27;s a chemical stew. And the smell, although pleasant at first, won&#x27;t go away - I can taste it, it&#x27;s so strong! My hair may look nice but it&#x27;s not worth it. Threw it away.</li>
    <li> I love it.....it works great</li>
    <li> The only shampoo and conditioner that work on my hair and do not irritate my scalp.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  Has a relaxing scent if you can describe that.  I have thick hair and I color it and this shampoo and conditioner keeps my hair soft and healthy.  When I received these bottles, they did not come with the pumps.  I had to order those and the ones I received that were for this shampoo, one broke and then I was left with one pump.  The conditioner is thick, so it doesn&#x27;t come out of the bottle easy.  Also, the bottle is big and I found it bulky and difficult to turn it upside down and hit it like a ketchup bottle to get the conditioner to come out.  I will stick with the smaller sizes.</li>
    <li> Switched from the Color Care line to Time Restore &amp; my hair is even softer &amp; healthier looking.  LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Like all products of this line strengthens the gloss and hair structure leaving them with strong and shiny addition to its wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> I still havent used it, but I am not sure if this is a real product because it does smell super weird and the labels dont look like the real ones AT ALL looks very fake... I hope it doesnt ruin my hair when I try it. I have used it in the past and doesnt look legit... Buy it from other place.. I am afraid this is not good one :(</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shampoo and conditioner.  The bottles are huge and the value was tremendous.  I buy lots and lots of high end products (think Okara, Fekkai, Carol&#x27;s Daughter, Ojon, etc.) and I think I will stick with this.  My hair is old and crunchy (totally dyed: long hair that is totally gray underneath) and this shampoo and conditioner are just great.  Makes my hair smooth and manageable.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Cleans fine, and smells fine, but doesn&#x27;t seem to have any effect on stimulating growth</li>
    <li> To be clear the shampoo and conditioner are great.  The bad is that a question about the pump being included was ask (bc it is not specified if it is included or not) and the answer was yes the pumps are included.  Don&#x27;t believe it.  There are NO pumps with the bottles.  False advertising.  I hate to be lied to.</li>
    <li> I paid more for one bottle 7ounce at that of this shampoo than the cost of these two items. My hair is colored. This shampoo helps keep it healthy and shiny</li>
    <li> been very nice. I like the way my hair feel. I likes the Bonicure smell better but this is smother. My husband uses it and he made the remark about how his hair feels like its not there. I am sure most men use the wifes shampoo as mine does. His hair stays in good condition so I know it works well.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner set smells great and I love how soft my hair feels after using it. It&#x27;s also very shiny and is easy to style. Great value for a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble with thin hair my entire life. As I&#x27;ve gotten into my mid 30s, my hair became even more thin and lifeless. My curls were lacking in bounce even after being freshly trimmed. I was lucky that I came across this product in a free trial and FELL.IN.LOVE!! My hair has never been fuller, the curls much, much better, just crazy how great this works. I told my mom about it and bought her some... same effect!! I also told a neighbor friend about it (as well as several others) because I am that impressed with this product. I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite some time and the positive changes to my hair have not gone away, so it&#x27;s not a fluke!!</li>
    <li> Recommended by an old school stylist who knows about hair cuticle and what bad shampoos do to your hair.</li>
    <li> I only gave this 3 stars because it should be&lt;br /&gt;labeled for thick and/or curly hair, which it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;not.  I have very fine &amp; relatively straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;And this Did Not work for me.  Felt gummy&lt;br /&gt;in my hair... too thick and it tangled my hair&lt;br /&gt;horribly. The conditioner was supposed to&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;detangle&#x27; (according to the label) but that&lt;br /&gt;did not even come close. It mucked up my&lt;br /&gt;hair so bad that I could not get a comb through.</li>
    <li> It was very good and I will buy it again.  I would recomment it to all of my friends.  And the price was so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and colored hair and this is perfect.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great brand of products, but my hair did not like the product. It was heavy, dull, lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard of that product very well. I know people who use and like.</li>
    <li> I use them both exclusively ever since I found them.  My hair is shiny and soft but does not weight my hair down.  I have baby fine, thick hair and not every product works for me.  I am older and my hair had lost the shiny, healthy look like in the olden days and I believe this helps to restore my previous conditions.  Plus it smells wonderful!  (I have acute sense of smell, a burden and a joy at the same time} and I am a smell freak!!</li>
    <li> I buy my product at TJ Max my conditioner and I love it!! And my shampoo at Marshall. Great product I used on bleach hair it really save my hair.i also use my olapplex #3 ones a week!</li>
    <li> Counterfeit Alert! I have been using Schwarzkopf Q 10 for a couple of years and always loved the ease with which I can style my unruly hair. I purchased this item trusting the mostly positive reviews, but when I washed my hair with the products I recently purchased, I noticed a strong odor of petroleum and a very thin consistency. I used the product hoping for the best, but was very disappointed with the results. I will contact Amazon and hope they don&#x27;t continue to sell products from this seller.</li>
    <li> I liked the smell of this product but it made my hair dryer and more brittle than it was. I switched to Joico and it&#x27;s seems ok for now.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I need to improve the looks of my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed and am wondering if the formula changed.  My hairdresser used the same combo on my hair in the salon and the results prompted me to buy it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and it  may just be too rich for my skin &amp; hair at this point.  Despite the product feeling lightweight in the hand and having a fantastic scent, by the end of the first day wash, my hair feels heavy and takes on a weird-dirty scent.  The same scent that sticks in your hair when you&#x27;re on a motorcycle.  I&#x27;m having build up and drying in different places on my scalp and itching that is quite annoying.  I am a thorough scrubber and although I know I&#x27;m rinsing out the product, I had a similar experience when using Pantene.  Just a bad combo for my chemistry.  Super bummed.</li>
    <li> I buy this shampoo for my husband who has thinning hair. I believe it has helped slow his hair loss since he has been using it. I will continue to buy for him.</li>
    <li> I found the product very good. I recommend. My hair was wonderful. Super soft and shiny. Still very fragrant. Nominate.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for a long time.  It smells good, conditions well without weighing the hair down, and gave my curls some good bounce.  The shampoo is the perfect amount of clean yet conditioned.  The conditioner is really absorbed but rinses well.  I like to alternate this with a &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; alternative called Hair One.  I highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Both are of size 33.8 oz / 1000ml as indicated in the headline.  Other than that the product and delivery are pretty good.  But I bought this combo just because of the size..</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair, so was looking for a product that would give me some volume. Nice scent. Liked both the shampoo and c onditioner. Great price from this seller.</li>
    <li> The conditioner smells and looks old; the shampoo was fine.</li>
    <li> Love this product...it makes my hair very soft and manageable, and it has controlled hair loss.</li>
    <li> This product fulfilled all my expectations and since I´ve started to using it I&#x27;m fully satisfied. Schwarzkopf always impress me.</li>
    <li> Have been trying to find a great shampoo for over 50 hair that controls the gray and moisturizes Colorado treated hair.  Have been using Wen and pantenes new product for women over 50.  This product left my hair manageable,  smooth and I seem to be able to wash hair every other day instead of daily.  Would recommend.  Smells great too.</li>
    <li> This is what my hair guy has used on my naturally curly hair and recommended.  When I was able to get this via Amazon at a better deal than he did, he was jealous and then got some for himself!  The other thing that was an extra bonus is the conditioner is great for shaving your legs and armpits!  The best ever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to have to say the conditioner was not what I had expected. As I purchased the same conditioner in the past and it had been white in color and my recent purchase it was beige in color.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this shampoo at a salon- *NOT on-line-this is a wonderful product and worth the money. I am 51 years old and not gray yet, but my hair was getting dry and tangled, less shine, and feeling thinner. One use and I can see and feel a difference. The shampoo alone made my hair feel stiff while it was wet, the conditioner had it so soft and silky the tangles fell out immediately. I could see the shine coming out as it was drying. Once dry&#x3D;clean, silky, shiny, extremely manageable, no tangles after several hours! Big change for the better. There should be NO CHEMICAL SMELL-DO NOT USE IT IF THERE IS! I could not smell plastic from the container either. Also there should be a large gold &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; on the shampoo bottle and a &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; on the conditioner. There is NO PEEL OFF LABEL on a legit product. The legit shampoo has a mild clean smell. Your body can absorb chemicals through the skin-the reviews were scary on this product from this seller, so I wanted to write a review from the perspective of trying the legitimate shampoo and conditioner from the salon today. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I love this product....the last time I ordered I got pumps to go into the liter bottles....can I get those?</li>
    <li> Great stuff. We love it!</li>
    <li> My neighbors own a high end salon and she recommended Schwarzkopf to me over Enjoy &amp; Pureology.  Best product ever for over processed and colored hair!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this on my hair. I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel.I have fine thin hair and it does not make my hair heavy. I finally purchased some from my hairdresser $$$$. Found it on Amazon half the cost. Will always get from Amazon. Several people have switched to this by word of mouth. Can&#x27;t say enough good about this product! Great seller</li>
    <li> Great Value! Great product!</li>
    <li> Nothing special. I see no DRAMATIC differance over a pantene.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this product makes it feel so healthy and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  Love it!  Also received it much sooner before estimated time of arrival.</li>
    <li> Originally bought this product from my hair dresser.  Much cheaper online. I don&#x27;t think it is quite as concentrated but well worth it for the difference in the price. You may have to use a bit more but works very well and leaves my hair soft and shiny. Fast delivery.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great product I would recommend it to anyone!!&lt;br /&gt;I really like Schwarzkofp BC Time and restore Shampoo and Conditioner to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner not only makes my hair look healthy and alive, but I have started growing new hair! My hair was thining from a medical condition and it has made my hair full again. It is the BEST hair product out there!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> Packed great. No leakage. That, I appreciate.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for a damage hair.  I tried it because i had so much treatment in my hair it was great!</li>
    <li> Just like description but I received the worng item. Should be one conditioner and one shampoo.I received 2 shampoos instead.</li>
    <li> The $3 shampoo you get in walmart washes you hair better than this one. This is the first time I bought Schwarzkopf product. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo of all the products I had ever used. After few times using, my hair become softer and smell good! Love IT!!!</li>
    <li> Every time I use this shampoo, I find my hair drops quite a lot! I don&#x27;t dare to use it any more. And its smell is weird.</li>
    <li> My best choice ever! A really good shampoo and conditioner that acts as a perfect treatment for hair!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo &amp; Conditions!</li>
    <li> I have been using these shampoo since  I started coloring my hair,  and it&#x27;s working good on my hair. I love it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair care product.  The fragrance is lovely and I only have to use a little bit to get a great wash and condition!!</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE shampoo and conditioner! The conditioner is the best, it rinses out well and prevents tangles better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.  The pumps that came with them don&#x27;t work, one was missing parts and the other just didn&#x27;t do anything. I saved my smaller bottles I bought last time so I just filled them. Otherwise,  all good.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner works well. I especially like the scent. My hair feels less dry. It gives me softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my only complaint is, since I have rheumatoid arthritis, I would appreciate the containers to come with a pump. I don&#x27;t use this as much as my other shampoo and conditioner which does come with a pump.</li>
    <li> Thsi is my fav shampoo and conditioner.  It has a really nice scent, and it makes my hair really soft and shiny.  I have highlighted hair.</li>
