### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent value.  </li>
      <li>in all very happy with this purchase</li>
      <li>the item arrived on time and has been a very great convenience when I travel.</li>
      <li>and it works perfect at every hotel he&#x27;s been in.  </li>
      <li>pack perfectly in my toiletry bag..</li>
      <li>After all these years, it&#x27;s still one of the best travel items a man can have.</li>
      <li>The mirror seemed to be perfect.</li>
      <li>I had one years ago and it lasted quite a while as I am out of town on business a fair amount.</li>
      <li>Great folding form factor makes for easy packing.</li>
      <li>I received the product and was impressed with certain design features like the fold out shelf</li>
      <li>Save your money - you can find something better that is supported by the vendor.</li>
      <li>okay does what I need it to do.</li>
      <li>one more word</li>
      <li>I use this for travel and it works ok.  </li>
      <li>The quality of the mirror and case is great and the included tray is a bonus (but don&#x27;t expect to place to much weight on the tray).</li>
      <li>easy to travel with.  </li>
      <li>He says it is easy to pack in his toiletries bag</li>
      <li>; I wouldn&#x27;t put a full can of shaving cream on it but a razor and toothbrush would be okay.</li>
      <li>The fold-out shelf is good for razor but might not be strong enough for the can of shaving cream/gel.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only travel mirror we&#x27;ve found with a cover that&#x27;s good for traveling.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this mirror for years and all the reviews are true.  </li>
      <li>well that&#x27;s true</li>
      <li>Plus the plastic \\&quot;mirror\\&quot; was easily scratched by a soft bath towel when drying it off.</li>
      <li>When I purchased my first one there was a defect in the hinge.  </li>
      <li>I purchased my first one over 10 years ago and the airline just lost my bag</li>
      <li>But my first one lasted me 10 years.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it - the suction cup flap broke.</li>
      <li>One note though, be sure to use travel size cans of shaving cream as the shelf can not accommodate a larger home size can.&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
      <li>This travel mirror is just what is called for when you like to shave in the shower so that you can make use of the hot water and steam.</li>
      <li>The suction cups work most of the time but need a flat surface.</li>
      <li>If you travel or go to the gym often it is very convenient.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s true but all you have to do is lay it on the shelf, so no big deal.  </li>
      <li>Bonus is being able to hang you razor from it and put your little bottles of shampoo and conditioner on it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not super bulky and packs easily into luggage.</li>
      <li>All in all, this is a decent and convenient travel mirror for the frequent traveler.</li>
      <li>the rubber attachments to the tile come off some times;  the mirror does stay clear.  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used this new one yet, but it&#x27;s the same one my husband has had for years.</li>
      <li>As with any suction cup in the shower you must clean the soap scum from the area of the wall where you want to hang it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this mirror for years and all the reviews are true.  If you travel or go to the gym often it is very convenient. And, yes, it does fog up from time to time but a handful of water splashed on it will fix that. The suction cups work most of the time but need a flat surface. Somebody complained about the inability of the shelf to hold weight...well that&#x27;s true; I wouldn&#x27;t put a full can of shaving cream on it but a razor and toothbrush would be okay. And it can break...it&#x27;s just plastic. And it&#x27;s true the clarity is not perfect but this is a product for portability, not perfection. Oh, and the reviewer who noticed that some razors don&#x27;t hang depending on the model...that&#x27;s true but all you have to do is lay it on the shelf, so no big deal.  All in all, this is a decent and convenient travel mirror for the frequent traveler. Not great but it works.</li>
    <li> The quality of this unit is very poor.  Tried to put a fog solution on the mirror surface and the mirror finish immediately marred rendering the unit useless.</li>
    <li> the rubber attachments to the tile come off some times;  the mirror does stay clear.  easy to travel with.  would buy it again.</li>
    <li> HERE WE GO AGAIN...HAVING BOUGHT A FEW EXPANSIVE FOGLESS MIRRORS ONLY TO HAVE THEM FALL OFF THE WALL FROM A POOR WEIGHT TO SUCTION POWER RATIO - THIS MIRROR FAILS AGAIN.  I received the product and was impressed with certain design features like the fold out shelf but the 3 suction cups are small and the unit has dropped off the wall twice already.  This mirro has an option to clip on to a Shower nozel shelf bracket some people hang from their Shower head but I find that placing a Fogless Mirror there is right in the path of water and hard to shave facing the shower head....  Inexpensive yet smaller mirror than I thought but isn&#x27;t for me...</li>
    <li> Just purchased another one.  I purchased my first one over 10 years ago and the airline just lost my bag so I need another.  As with any suction cup in the shower you must clean the soap scum from the area of the wall where you want to hang it.  While the suction cups are small there are three so they hold quite well.  When I purchased my first one there was a defect in the hinge.  Two minutes of research on the internet got me the address of the manufacturer.  I mailed it to them and they replaced it immediately.</li>
    <li> This mirror fell off the shower wall after about the second use, and the bracket that holds the suction cups broke. I contacted the vendor and was told to contact the manufacturer, and he didn&#x27;t even provide their contact information. So this product has been essentially unuseable as designed. I am disappointed with it and the vendor. Plus the plastic \\&quot;mirror\\&quot; was easily scratched by a soft bath towel when drying it off. Save your money - you can find something better that is supported by the vendor.</li>
    <li> The mirror seemed to be perfect. The first time I used it - the suction cup flap broke. There was no way to fix it.</li>
    <li> I had one years ago and it lasted quite a while as I am out of town on business a fair amount. This is my second one and I see that the quality hasn&#x27;t changed. Works well as long as there is a perfectly flat surface for the suction cups to do their thing.</li>
    <li> This travel mirror is just what is called for when you like to shave in the shower so that you can make use of the hot water and steam. The quality of the mirror and case is great and the included tray is a bonus (but don&#x27;t expect to place to much weight on the tray). This version of the Caddy is an improvement over the previous Caddy that I had back in the 90&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care what they say, this mirror fogs up in the shower! Depending on what type of razors you have, they may not stay in the holders. Mine kept falling off. I should have saved my money and just bought a regular small square mirror and propped it up on my shower shelf.</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money.....JUNK</li>
    <li> Try cannot hold shaving cream that is too heavy.  Suction cups don&#x27;t always hold well.  But my first one lasted me 10 years.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t leave home without it.  Then, when I left a hotel without it, I needed another.  After all these years, it&#x27;s still one of the best travel items a man can have.</li>
    <li> The suction cups fall out. The weight is not portion to the suction cups. Does not stick to a lot of tile surfaces. Bad design</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this new one yet, but it&#x27;s the same one my husband has had for years. It&#x27;s the only travel mirror we&#x27;ve found with a cover that&#x27;s good for traveling. It&#x27;s not super bulky and packs easily into luggage.</li>
    <li> pack perfectly in my toiletry bag..doesnt stick so well but thats okay does what I need it to do. one more word</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who travels a lot and he loves it.  He says it is easy to pack in his toiletries bag and it works perfect at every hotel he&#x27;s been in.  Bonus is being able to hang you razor from it and put your little bottles of shampoo and conditioner on it.</li>
    <li> the item arrived on time and has been a very great convenience when I travel. One note though, be sure to use travel size cans of shaving cream as the shelf can not accommodate a larger home size can.&lt;br /&gt;all in all very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> I use this for travel and it works ok.  But it is a little too big for me and not all hotels have the correct wall to hook it to.</li>
    <li> Excellent value.  Works ad advertized and cost is far less than competition.  The fold-out shelf is good for razor but might not be strong enough for the can of shaving cream/gel.  Great folding form factor makes for easy packing.</li>
