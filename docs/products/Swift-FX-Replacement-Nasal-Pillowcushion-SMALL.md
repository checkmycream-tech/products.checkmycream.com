### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and they work just great!</li>
      <li>Best CPAP mask</li>
      <li>Perfect name brand nose pillow at a fraction of the &amp;#34;insurance cost&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Works perfectly.</li>
      <li>it was so great to find these some where else.</li>
      <li>These are EXCELLENT&#x3D; made by the manufacturer, shipped quickly</li>
      <li>Stylish - lol, j/k&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS THING!</li>
      <li>Good product quick delivery</li>
      <li>the pricr was better.</li>
      <li>I think he&#x27;ll change his mind, wear it, and start feeling better.</li>
      <li>So I figured I&#x27;d \\&quot;tool\\&quot; around Amazon (LOVE Amazon btw) to see what supplies they had.</li>
      <li>I prefer this pillow to many others.  </li>
      <li>Easy to clean with warm water and soap.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fine product: arrived timely.</li>
      <li>Comfortable and stays in place.  </li>
      <li>Meets my needs and comfortable during sleep.</li>
      <li>I SO love it that my doc is telling me how cheap I am by not buying from his happy little supplier.</li>
      <li>Exactly the same product sold by all the cpap providers - at a great price.</li>
      <li>Why pay full price?</li>
      <li>It is nice and soft.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t buy it right away, but took a couple of days</li>
      <li>Good service &amp; exactly what I expected</li>
      <li>For something like this, when you use insurance the price gets jacked up even higher, the insurance applies the &amp;#34;negotiated rate&amp;#34;, and there is still a gaping hole in your wallet.  </li>
      <li>SUPER SOFT &amp; COMFY</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping to convince him to get this and really try it.</li>
      <li>, b/c he refuses to wear the mask prescribed to him like 120 years ago (j/k, really 10 but might as well be 120)</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the type that fits over his whole face like a fireman.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>We bought two this time so we&#x27;d always have a spare, but with delivery this fast</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the same brand and model i originally started using.  </li>
      <li>Arrived as expected very quickly.</li>
      <li>There are two nostril inserts that actually fit inside your nostrils (not very far)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>/&gt;BE AWARE, that you MUST order the assembly pieces and headgear separately, as this is just for the nasal insert only.</li>
      <li>Just because an item is made for the medical industry does not mean it should cost 600% over the cost of manufacture.</li>

<li> WHY DID IT TAKE ME SO LONG?!!!</li>
<li> I was prescribed a nasal mask, and it never fit properly b/c</li>
<li> BTW I did order the nasal piece in small, the assembly (which comes with a free medium size piece) and the headgear/strap and it cost me a total of $127, not too bad being</li>
<li> not much exciting to say about this.  </li>
<li> Just like the expensive one we get at the medical companies without the price &amp; hassle.</li>
<li> I have a small head/face.</li>
<li> didnt like the over the nose masks and now if you rolled over on your side the the seal got broken it would shoot air in your eye.</li>
<li> Some ridiculously expensive things require you to use insurance.  </li>

<ol>
    <li> This is just like the nasal pillows that came with my CPAP. It is nice and soft. Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Best CPAP mask i&#x27;ve tried!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didnt like the over the nose masks and now if you rolled over on your side the the seal got broken it would shoot air in your eye. No problems like that with this mask</li>
    <li> Good product quick delivery</li>
    <li> Good service &amp; exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> I prefer this pillow to many others.  Comfortable and stays in place.  Easy to clean with warm water and soap.</li>
    <li> it was so great to find these some where else. the pricr was better. will order tis item again. thanks</li>
    <li> not much exciting to say about this.  it&#x27;s the same brand and model i originally started using.  i needed a replacement so there ya go.</li>
    <li> Perfect name brand nose pillow at a fraction of the &amp;#34;insurance cost&amp;#34;.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> THIS THING *ROCKS*!!! This is for a CPAP user. I was prescribed a nasal mask, and it never fit properly b/c I have a small head/face. So I figured I&#x27;d \\&quot;tool\\&quot; around Amazon (LOVE Amazon btw) to see what supplies they had. Well lo&#x27; n behold I found this gem. I didn&#x27;t buy it right away, but took a couple of days pro n&#x27; con&#x27;ing it to death. So I decided oh well why not try it? WHY DID IT TAKE ME SO LONG?!!! I LOVE THIS THING! here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Triangular nasal mask I currently used never had a proper fit;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. There are two nostril inserts that actually fit inside your nostrils (not very far)&lt;br /&gt;2. SUPER SOFT &amp; COMFY&lt;br /&gt;3. Stylish - lol, j/k&lt;br /&gt;3. No More messing around moving the mask here &amp; there and the loud whooshing of air. (unless you like that)&lt;br /&gt;4. Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE AWARE, that you MUST order the assembly pieces and headgear separately, as this is just for the nasal insert only. BTW I did order the nasal piece in small, the assembly (which comes with a free medium size piece) and the headgear/strap and it cost me a total of $127, not too bad being it&#x27;s a medical supply for CPAP&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be \\&quot;skype&#x27;ing\\&quot; my dad to tell him to buy this, b/c he refuses to wear the mask prescribed to him like 120 years ago (j/k, really 10 but might as well be 120) it&#x27;s the type that fits over his whole face like a fireman. Hell I wouldn&#x27;t wear it either. I&#x27;m hoping to convince him to get this and really try it. I think he&#x27;ll change his mind, wear it, and start feeling better.</li>
    <li> Some ridiculously expensive things require you to use insurance.  For something like this, when you use insurance the price gets jacked up even higher, the insurance applies the &amp;#34;negotiated rate&amp;#34;, and there is still a gaping hole in your wallet.

    <li> Exactly the same product sold by all the cpap providers - at a great price.</li>
    <li> I am tempted to write an 8 page review on a set of nasal &amp;#34;pillows&amp;#34;. Instead, let me just say, &amp;#34;&amp;#34;They work.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Hubby needed a replacement nasal pillow for his CPAP and it arrived &amp;#34;swiftly&amp;#34; and was as described. We bought two this time so we&#x27;d always have a spare, but with delivery this fast it might not have been necessary.</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected very quickly.</li>
    <li> Made a big difference when I got this replacement.</li>
    <li> Why pay full price? These are EXCELLENT&#x3D; made by the manufacturer, shipped quickly and they work just great! I SO love it that my doc is telling me how cheap I am by not buying from his happy little supplier. From now on all of my CPAP supplies that I can buy this way- will be bought this way. Just because an item is made for the medical industry does not mean it should cost 600% over the cost of manufacture.</li>
    <li> Just like the expensive one we get at the medical companies without the price &amp; hassle. Had no problems with this.</li>
    <li> Meets my needs and comfortable during sleep.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and was what I request</li>
    <li> Fine product: arrived timely.</li>
