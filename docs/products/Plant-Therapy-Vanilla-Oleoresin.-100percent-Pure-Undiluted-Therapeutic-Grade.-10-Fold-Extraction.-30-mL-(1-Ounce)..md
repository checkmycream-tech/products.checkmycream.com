      <li>They&#x27;re always clear and mix perfectly with all carrier oils and this does not!</li>
      <li>This is very strong and pure, and does the job beautifully.</li>
      <li>(all the pure oils have been great, but I did NOT like the Tranquil Synergy</li>
      <li>the real deal at a great price</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m sure I cannot return it.</li>
      <li>This is more like an extract.</li>
      <li>love the smell did not work for intended purpose did not mix well with coconut oil</li>
      <li>and I love the fragrance.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even after many days.</li>
      <li>As most know, most oils are lighter than water and will float on the top.</li>
      <li>This product smells like vanilla, but not that potent.  </li>
      <li>Very relaxing oil helps me sleep really good</li>
      <li>High quality and good value</li>
      <li>I gave it three stars because the customer service was wonderful but the product itself was a little lacking.</li>
      <li>Plant Therapy has great quality essential oils.  </li>
      <li>The vanilla is a great essential oil.  </li>
      <li>This smells just like vanilla extract so make sure you get the right one when you&#x27;re embarking on a craft project.  </li>
      <li>The oil is very strong, however, and doesn&#x27;t smell very vanilla-like.</li>
      <li>This vanilla oil is dark like vanilla extract and has a very nice strong  smell.</li>
      <li>Wow this smells amazing.</li>
      <li>Smells good and mixed into my lotion like I wanted.</li>
      <li>I use vanilla &amp; sweet orange EO to make homemade hand soaps.  </li>
      <li>more like a VERY overpriced vanilla extract.  </li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t really smell like vanilla, more like spiced rum.</li>
      <li>Kinda spendy, but fortunately you don&#x27;t need much if you&#x27;re not making huge quantities of something.</li>
      <li>quick shipping too</li>
      <li>I love the smell of pretty much anything vanilla!  </li>
      <li>I received the vanilla eo quickly and unharmed.</li>
      <li>it being super concentrated.</li>
      <li>Best vanilla essential oil I&#x27;ve found especially for the price in 30 years!</li>
      <li>It lasts a long time and sells at a good price.</li>
      <li>Oh this is a great buy as a little seem to go along way..</li>
      <li>I warm my carrier oils over heat until they melt and then add essential oils before jarring them.</li>
      <li>A nice mellow vanilla aroma when used in soap making, and definitely not overpowering in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>Scent was pleasant but the staining of skin was no fun.</li>
      <li>Vanilla oil is a good oil to use to enhance other oil aromas.</li>
      <li>AND, they sank right to the bottom like a stone.</li>
      <li>Perhaps I needed to raise the wax temperature, but I found that it settled much too quickly at the bottom of the container.  </li>
      <li>Using just a few drops has given the shea butter a really yummy welcome scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had EO that was clear and smelled strongly of vanilla</li>
      <li>it does not smell like vanilla at all-- and very much like bourbon.</li>
      <li>I make my own body butters and skin care products and this particular essential oil just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
      <li>I have seen vanilla eo for sale at a higher price, so</li>
      <li>When ordering essential oils you aren&#x27;t sure you are going to get what you intended to order.  </li>
      <li>Probably the altitude change to get here,  it leaked and was pretty funky at that juncture.</li>
      <li>When I compare my previous purchases for more costly oils there is no comparison - this seller offers more economical value and no quality is sacrificed.</li>
      <li>These sensuous and relaxing oils can be mixed with a carrier oil for a full body massage, worn on the skin as a beautiful and long lasting fragrance, or evaporated under a candle powered ceramic, electric, or reed diffuser, for a luxurious and subdued effect.</li>
      <li>It does have a deep, strong vanilla smell, but it also smells just like vanilla extract...  </li>
      <li>I was seeking a pure vanilla as a component of my massage oil.</li>
      <li>I love it, I only wish that it wasn&#x27;t so dark because it changes the color of my product, but is okay.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Plant Therapy Essential Oils company has been attentive and has followed up on my orders.</li>
      <li>I will have to stick with Fabulous Frannie  version for now since it actually smells like vanilla.</li>
      <li>I wish I had read the description more carefully.</li>
      <li>Very overpriced for this quality.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I can find a way to use it, but I will have to get another bottle of vanilla EO from some other brand.</li>
      <li>It is strong enough to justify paying a bit more; you only need to use a tiny amount.</li>
      <li>Mixed with sweet orange oil, the vanilla makes it smell just like an old fashioned dreamsicle from the ice cream truck!!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like it</li>
      <li>A little darker than I expected but very nice oil.</li>
      <li>Be aware that different oils have different densities, and might not mix together smoothly.</li>
      <li>When stirred gently, they completely dispersed in the water.</li>
      <li>I wanted a essential oil that I could mix with  100% shea butter oil to create an all over bodly lotion that I could use daily and this product fit the bill.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is not an essential oil. It&#x27;s brown and doesn&#x27;t act like ANY other essential oils I&#x27;ve ever purchased. They&#x27;re always clear and mix perfectly with all carrier oils and this does not! I&#x27;m so disappointed! I wouldn&#x27;t even give this one star, as it is unusable for me.</li>
    <li> All kinds of funky smells in this and Edens Gardens is even worse :(  I will have to stick with Fabulous Frannie  version for now since it actually smells like vanilla.</li>
    <li> Smells Great wife plans on making her own hand cream.</li>
    <li> Best vanilla essential oil I&#x27;ve found especially for the price in 30 years!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this, I just received mine today and this stuff is HORRIBLE. i got it to use as perfume since I usually use regular cooking vanilla on my wrists, I thought I would use this since I am a fan of essential oils and it was not diluted with alcohol.... big mistake. 1.) It&#x27;s sticky! 2.) it stains 3.) it does not smell like vanilla at all-- and very much like bourbon. Worst thing? I&#x27;ve used it so I&#x27;m sure I cannot return it. I have used/purchased from plant therapy before but this vanilla is just not up to par.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla- it smells like rum/alcohol- Oil usually floats in water- this one sinks in&lt;br /&gt;water and stains your diffuser; I am not recommending this- I hope they could improve this product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s dark and reminds me of actual vanilla&lt;br /&gt;Extract while I was looking for essential oil for fregrances.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product! It is strong enough to justify paying a bit more; you only need to use a tiny amount. Be aware that different oils have different densities, and might not mix together smoothly. Because this vanilla is so concentrated, it is \\&quot;heavier\\&quot; than other oils in my staple blend, so I have to shake it well before using. For those who don&#x27;t already know, vanilla is very dark, and will stain light-colored clothing. I only use it in small amounts in a blend, and I haven&#x27;t had that problem because I use oils on my skin, not my clothes. The smell from this is really lovely! I especially like it with cinnamon bark oil; my neighbor tried it and said it smells like red-hots candies. Very nice also with jasmine and orange.</li>
    <li> Good quality product. Smells great. Mix with alcohol, not carrier oil!</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick and great. The oil is very strong, however, and doesn&#x27;t smell very vanilla-like. This may, however, be due to it being super concentrated. I will be using it to make soap, so we will see how it turns out soon!</li>
    <li> Smells great. quick shipping too</li>
    <li> I wish I had read the description more carefully. This stuff is not your normal essential oil. It is thick, black, and will stain whatever it touches. It WILL discolor whatever you are making. It&#x27;s more like boiled down vanilla extract than essential oil. I&#x27;m not returning it because they *did* state the color in the description, and I just missed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it doesn&#x27;t really smell like vanilla, more like spiced rum. I&#x27;ve had EO that was clear and smelled strongly of vanilla so I know that this isn&#x27;t the way they all are. I&#x27;m sure I can find a way to use it, but I will have to get another bottle of vanilla EO from some other brand.</li>
    <li> I bought this Vanilla Essential Oil for candle making.  I don&#x27;t particularly like it but it seems to be a quality oil.  Perhaps I needed to raise the wax temperature, but I found that it settled much too quickly at the bottom of the container.  There is some pretty decent scent throw cold and hot, at 1oz to 1lb.  I will try again with another batch and re-review then.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT bargain and I also very much enjoy the fragrance.  I use it for bath preparations and have absolutely NO complaints.  I have not been able to find a comparable quality/price anywhere else!</li>
    <li> This oil smells great and has the aroma I expect from a quality oil when burned in my tea light burner. It was a great purchase experience at a great price, I recommend and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> My bad, I should have read through all the reviews. This is NOT an EO.&lt;br /&gt;Thought it did not look like an EO, I went ahead and used it in my body oil and it refuses to mix with the base oil! Even after many days. It just settles at the bottom of the bottle and am not a fan of the smell either.</li>
    <li> This stuff is not the highest quality, if it&#x27;s essential oil at all. I&#x27;m not a EO pro, so I can&#x27;t give an expert opinion saying if it is or if it isnt but here&#x27;s my thoughts...I Smelled a vanilla eo in the store and it was almost double the price but it smelled like heaven, if heaven was made of vanilla cupcakes. I decided to buy it online instead. The one I received smelled gross, similar to cheap vanilla extract and is brown like vanilla extract too. I returned it without any issues. Amazon is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never worked with Vanilla Essential Oil before, and this oil acts much different from any other I&#x27;ve used.  It does have a deep, strong vanilla smell, but it also smells just like vanilla extract...  It works pretty well in my lotions and chapsticks, but leaves a very very faint smell in CP soap, so it&#x27;s pretty much just like using a high quality extract.</li>
    <li> Nice size bottle, it smells very nice.  Using in my homemade skincare.  Seems of good quality and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Smells absolutely wonderful.  I use vanilla &amp; sweet orange EO to make homemade hand soaps.  Mixed with sweet orange oil, the vanilla makes it smell just like an old fashioned dreamsicle from the ice cream truck!!  My husband loves it too, which is always a plus if Mr. Awesome likes it!!</li>
    <li> This smells just like vanilla extract so make sure you get the right one when you&#x27;re embarking on a craft project.  A nice mellow vanilla aroma when used in soap making, and definitely not overpowering in my opinion.  Kinda spendy, but fortunately you don&#x27;t need much if you&#x27;re not making huge quantities of something.</li>
    <li> product is listed as essential oil, however it is not oil.  added to coconut oil and it did not dissolve.  more like a VERY overpriced vanilla extract.  dark brownin color.  would not purchase again</li>
    <li> This oil is nice. Vanilla extract would probably be just as good of a substitute scent wise. Works great in sugar scrubs. I like to blend it with lavender.</li>
    <li> Not much vanilla aroma.  Brown liquid that does not scent and bath or room at all.&lt;br /&gt;Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> love the smell did not work for intended purpose did not mix well with coconut oil but I am sure I will find a good use for it</li>
    <li> This is vanilla extract not vanilla essential oil. The smell and color verify it. It also will not mix into my lip balm. All my actual essential oils do. Very disappointed. Not sure if I can return since some has already been used.</li>
    <li> I received the vanilla eo quickly and unharmed. It smelled really good too. I have added it to some salves that I made and I love the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plant Therapy Essential Oils company has been attentive and has followed up on my orders. I&#x27;ve purchased alot of oils from them.</li>
    <li> Very relaxing oil helps me sleep really good</li>
    <li> This is by no means an essential oil or, for that matter, an oil, at all. It does not mix with my other real essential oils and left a granular residue in my mixing bottle and dropper. To test if it is an oil, I filled a pint sized deli container with water and added a few drops AND, they sank right to the bottom like a stone. When stirred gently, they completely dispersed in the water. As most know, most oils are lighter than water and will float on the top. There are, with few exceptions, very dense oils that will not float and will sink. However, all oils, of all densities and viscosities, will never mix with water. NEVER! Oils can be emulsified in water but, when left alone, they will always separate. This is not the case with this vanilla smelling substance. If you are looking to buy an essential oil, this is not it.</li>
    <li> the real deal at a great price</li>
    <li> I love it, I only wish that it wasn&#x27;t so dark because it changes the color of my product, but is okay.</li>
    <li> This is not essential oil. This is more like an extract. It will not mix with your essential oil blends. Not as advertised.</li>
    <li> ummmm smells wonderful!!!!  I love the smell of pretty much anything vanilla!  I put this in my defuser and mix with other essentials ike orange or lemon or sometimes make a bend with orange, clove and vanilla.  It smells heavenly!  If you add a touch of cinnamon, it smells like Christmas!!!  Plant therapy has wonderful products and I have never been disappointed in anything of therirs.  They are a wonderful company!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this essential oil stained my hands brown. Scent was pleasant but the staining of skin was no fun. Would like to return it for a refund.</li>
    <li> I bought this and some lavender to use to scent some homemade laundry detergent. The 2 scents combined make a very nice scent for clothes.</li>
    <li> this item is not what I would call an essential oil. It is more of an extract of sorts...except worse smelling. It makes everything smell like bourbon or cigars..yuck. And you cannot return it.</li>
    <li> This product smells like vanilla, but not that potent.  I have seen vanilla eo for sale at a higher price, so I still think it&#x27;s a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> The vanilla is a great essential oil.  I use it in a shelter for alternating smells for the dogs that are housed there.</li>
    <li> Great smell and consistency.</li>
    <li> This vanilla oil is dark like vanilla extract and has a very nice strong  smell. It lasts a long time and sells at a good price. Vanilla oil is a good oil to use to enhance other oil aromas.</li>
    <li> Smells good and mixed into my lotion like I wanted. A little darker than I expected but very nice oil.</li>
    <li> Product was completely as advertised.  Smells just like vanilla extract but with less &amp;#34;alcohol&amp;#34; scent. The aroma is not overpowering and it blends well with other scents.</li>
    <li> High quality and good value</li>
    <li> I really hate leaving negative reviews but I was really disappointed with this product. The vanilla smell was not nearly as strong as other brands I&#x27;ve used. I make my own body butters and skin care products and this particular essential oil just didn&#x27;t do it for me. I gave it three stars because the customer service was wonderful but the product itself was a little lacking.</li>
    <li> I should have looked closer at the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT a &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; vanilla.  It smells like BURNED SUGAR.&lt;br /&gt;Wasted money!</li>
    <li> When ordering essential oils you aren&#x27;t sure you are going to get what you intended to order.  There are alot of bogus retailers out there.  Plant Therapy has an excellent product and I would recommend it to anyone in search of the right oils for their homeopathic remedies.  Also, amazon gets things to you in a snap and you are never left wondering ...&amp;#34;when did i actually order that and when is it supposed to get here?&amp;#34;  Let&#x27;s face it....we all have done that in our busy lives.  Plant Therapy and Amazon are a good team.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to jump on board.</li>
    <li> I wanted a essential oil that I could mix with  100% shea butter oil to create an all over bodly lotion that I could use daily and this product fit the bill. Using just a few drops has given the shea butter a really yummy welcome scent. People have been stopping me to ask what is the name of the &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; that I am wearing.. I will be ordering this essential oil and other in the near future. Oh this is a great buy as a little seem to go along way..</li>
    <li> I was seeking a pure vanilla as a component of my massage oil. This is very strong and pure, and does the job beautifully.</li>
    <li> I have purchased my oils for years. Just started using this seller 6 months ago and they are great - quality and price. When I compare my previous purchases for more costly oils there is no comparison - this seller offers more economical value and no quality is sacrificed. Suggest looking for the 30 ml size rather than the 10 ml for cost benefit.</li>
    <li> Probably the altitude change to get here,  it leaked and was pretty funky at that juncture.</li>
    <li> Great product as described.  Great for gnats!  add to massage oil and its a great soother!  Awesome addition to my collection of aromatherapy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a bunch for Plant Therapy and have always received good quality products, even if I ended up not liking the oil (all the pure oils have been great, but I did NOT like the Tranquil Synergy blend).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of other reviewers said this Vanilla scent was off, but I found it to be exactly what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchase oils to make my own face washes/body oils by mixing essential oils with coconut oil and raw cacao butter. If you were making something professionally, this oil may not work as it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;melt\\&quot; into the carrier oil as others do--I can still see veins of brown vanilla oil (it looks like balsamic vinegar) in my little glass pots. They don&#x27;t bother me at all, but they&#x27;re not aesthetically pleasing if you were making a mix to sell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. I warm my carrier oils over heat until they melt and then add essential oils before jarring them. Maybe there&#x27;s a different process required of vanilla?</li>
    <li> These sensuous and relaxing oils can be mixed with a carrier oil for a full body massage, worn on the skin as a beautiful and long lasting fragrance, or evaporated under a candle powered ceramic, electric, or reed diffuser, for a luxurious and subdued effect. Clearly the finest quality oil I have ever ordered!</li>
    <li> This was a mistake. It is not a normal essential oil. Very dark and will color everything. Used it for making soaps and soaps came out very dark color and I had to put a lot so it would smell at least a little bit. Very overpriced for this quality.</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy has great quality essential oils.  I buy from them a lot.</li>
    <li> Wow this smells amazing. It smells like vanilla extract and made a great brown sugar scrub. Made me hungry for cookies for sure!</li>
    <li> A good quality product.  I thought it a bit pricey, but it was what I needed and I would buy it again.</li>
