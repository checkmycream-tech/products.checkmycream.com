      <li>The best blue I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure if I hadn&#x27;t tried mixing colors to create turquoise</li>
      <li>and I do love their violet</li>
      <li>The product was shipped super quickly and communication when I had a problem was great.</li>
      <li>It lasts a long time and make sure to bleach to get the best effect!</li>
      <li>This really is the best line for intense, temporary color</li>
      <li>that I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this color or product, I would just have to say make sure you are fine with up</li>
      <li>but there&#x27;s something about special effects I love way more</li>
      <li>I enjoy Jerome Russel&#x27;s punky colour, ion, and directions so much better</li>
      <li>the most part, it can be assumed that this would happen but with the name that this company has for itself, I honestly had higher expectations.&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, once it started fading, it did so very quickly.</li>
      <li>The blue that it was, was BEAUTIFUL.</li>
      <li>Every color i&#x27;ve used has come out fine.</li>
      <li>The only problem I had was the smell is off putting, but the quality is great.  </li>
      <li>some parts have already faded to light purple/</li>
      <li>Comparing with what I bought the brand before, I love it very much.</li>
      <li>Staying power is pretty top of the line..</li>
      <li>I have never had any problems with Special effects dye.</li>
      <li>she loved the blue</li>
      <li>of my head is still in full color, yet</li>
      <li>This particular shade is a bit more on the navy side than it looks in the picture</li>
      <li>This particular brand is also my favorite semi-permanent hair dye.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very pretty</li>
      <li>actually liked how this color went from a true blue to a bit purple</li>
      <li>The color stays quite a long time assuming that you shampoo your hair only (best if done with anti-dandruff to remove residual oils) before applying.  </li>
      <li>had dyed my whole head five days ago and the color was fantastic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of a purpley blue</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice mix of blue and</li>
      <li>This is a beautiful dark blue, nice and vibrant.  </li>
      <li>This stuff fades pretty quickly in my hair.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s exactly the color i wanted, and 2 jars into manic panic, neither one of them is right.</li>
      <li>The pic, more purple in color, is right after I had done it and only used water to wash out the color.  </li>
      <li>(only think I have found better is Pravana Vivids..</li>
      <li>so I used 1/3 of the bottle for the first dye, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Love the color but only holds for about 2 washes</li>
      <li>but it is by no means an unattractive color and fades pretty well.</li>
      <li>It came out a very vibrant blue that I am extremely pleased with.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, lasts pretty long and the colors are pretty vivid.  </li>
      <li>We used it to cover up the purple that was fading fast, as I had dyed my 15 year olds hair for the summer.</li>
      <li>By far the longest lasting and vivid unnatural hair color, and I have tried many.</li>
      <li>I know blue is a hard color to keep bright and vibrant, but with the Special Effects reputation and my success with atomic pink, I had higher hopes for this color.</li>
      <li>hey, they created a new color!</li>
      <li>It lasted longer than the purple for sure, and I would definitely buy this blue and brand again next summer if she wants her hair dyed again.</li>
      <li>I have pretty short hair</li>
      <li>I was pretty bummed that blue mayhem faded like it did.</li>
      <li>Other Special Effects ColorShare a lot longer</li>
      <li>but the blue always washes out and fades really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
      <li>Not messy at all.  </li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t stay as long as the manic panic, but the manic panic colors are not true, so this one&#x27;s better.</li>
      <li>Lasts at least 4 weeks true color then fades to vibrant blue which lasts for another 4 to 6 weeks.</li>
      <li>It has lasted near a month and started fading just last week!    </li>
      <li>My mo-hawk is bright and stupid as ever thanks to their dye.</li>

<li> I continue to receive compliments on it everyday.</li>
<li> I like the thick consistency of this product.  </li>
<li> I bought this hair dye thinking it would at the very least tint</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was pretty bummed that blue mayhem faded like it did. I bleached my tips and did parts of my hair atomic pink and others blue mayhem. The atomic pink has not faded at all in two months and I love it! The blue mayhem has required several touch ups that don&#x27;t hardly last a week. I know blue is a hard color to keep bright and vibrant, but with the Special Effects reputation and my success with atomic pink, I had higher hopes for this color. I&#x27;ll probably not buy it again and use a bright purple instead.</li>
    <li> I have never had any problems with Special effects dye. Every color i&#x27;ve used has come out fine. My mo-hawk is bright and stupid as ever thanks to their dye.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure if I hadn&#x27;t tried mixing colors to create turquoise the color would have come out better.  Don&#x27;t mix.  Just buy the color itself.  I like the thick consistency of this product.  Not messy at all.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Package arrived 4 days after I placed order. It was nicely packaged and had tape around lid to prevent spills/leaks during the shipping.    Color itself is magnificent. It came out a very vibrant blue that I am extremely pleased with. It has lasted near a month and started fading just last week!    However, once it started fading, it did so very quickly. I&#x27;m already at the lavender stage, but it&#x27;s still a beautiful color. I continue to receive compliments on it everyday.</li>
    <li> Special Effects is an excellent brand of hair dye.  It&#x27;s easy to apply, lasts pretty long and the colors are pretty vivid.  Also, it has a thick enough consistency that it won&#x27;t drip and run while it sets.  This particular shade is a bit more on the navy side than it looks in the picture but it is by no means an unattractive color and fades pretty well.</li>
    <li> Lasts longer than any other blue I&#x27;ve tried, and fades to purple and silver instead of the gross greens other blue dyes fade to. I was very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of haircolor and i use it instead of manic panic all the time. Its wonderful and the color is bright and lasts for weeks instead of days like the other brands</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dye thinking it would at the very least tint my hair blue. I had bleached my head before trying the product so that i would get the best results, however all i got was darker browner hair. There was no blue coloring at all. I left it on for longer than the recommended 30 mins and nothing. All i got was blueish purple suds when i was shampooing it out.     Also this isn&#x27;t navy colored at all. The dye is a bluish purple similar to the ink color in pens.</li>
    <li> I can not recommend this product highly enough! I have used this type of dye for going on two years and the color is amazing! It lasts a long time and make sure to bleach to get the best effect!</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t so great. Other Special Effects ColorShare a lot longer but the blue always washes out and fades really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t that reflect the seller though. The product was shipped super quickly and communication when I had a problem was great.</li>
    <li> Excellent packaging, very prompt transaction, amazing quality product! I&#x27;m pretty happy. I used to use Pravana all the time and I do love their violet but there&#x27;s something about special effects I love way more</li>
    <li> Love the color but only holds for about 2 washes</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved it. It lasts longer than any other hair dye I&#x27;ve tried and it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing. It turns purple once it begins to fade, but it gives it nice shades of color.</li>
    <li> Awesome is all I can say.  I did not dye my hair lighter and it is AWESOME and vivid.  The pic, more purple in color, is right after I had done it and only used water to wash out the color.  The second pic is 2 weeks later.  The color stays quite a long time assuming that you shampoo your hair only (best if done with anti-dandruff to remove residual oils) before applying.  In fact, It was put in my hair on 6/10 and I still have some residual color today 7/31.  Anyway, buying more today!</li>
    <li> I have pretty short hair so I used 1/3 of the bottle for the first dye, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;I had dyed my whole head five days ago and the color was fantastic. It&#x27;s a nice mix of blue and purple.&lt;br /&gt;Most of my head is still in full color, yet some parts have already faded to light purple/white.&lt;br /&gt;For the most part, it can be assumed that this would happen but with the name that this company has for itself, I honestly had higher expectations.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not that I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this color or product, I would just have to say make sure you are fine with up keep.&lt;br /&gt;I have only washed the colored parts of my hair (My bangs are still black) twice so far at this time.</li>
    <li> I used to use the pink color and it stays on my hair for looong time and this blue runs out in 1 week. The color ir very beautiful though.</li>
    <li> Love this color. Staying power is pretty top of the line.. (only think I have found better is Pravana Vivids..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It bleeds a bit but ALL colors like this do..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually liked how this color went from a true blue to a bit purple but you should be warned that it does just in case that&#x27;s not what you want.</li>
    <li> Love this color! Use it all the time! It&#x27;s kind of a purpley blue but it&#x27;s very pretty and it sometimes washes out to a silvery color.</li>
    <li> This really is the best line for intense, temporary color</li>
    <li> she loved the blue it was  good product because her hair did not become frizzy after she used this .</li>
    <li> The dye is alright it&#x27;s not the best but not the worst. I guess I prefer Adore hair dye it&#x27;s way cheaper than this and works 10x better</li>
    <li> Best blue I&#x27;ve ever had and it fades out really nicely</li>
    <li> I bleached my hair before using this product and it turned to purple after 2 washes.  The blue that it was, was BEAUTIFUL. And the purple was alright too. I just wish it stayed longer.</li>
    <li> By far the longest lasting and vivid unnatural hair color, and I have tried many. Would have given 5 stars, but it was shipped in a plastic zip lock bag and leaked out every where.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful dark blue, nice and vibrant.  The only problem I had was the smell is off putting, but the quality is great.  We used it to cover up the purple that was fading fast, as I had dyed my 15 year olds hair for the summer. It lasted longer than the purple for sure, and I would definitely buy this blue and brand again next summer if she wants her hair dyed again.</li>
    <li> The best blue I&#x27;ve ever tried. Love special effects, great product.</li>
    <li> This stuff fades pretty quickly in my hair. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s due to my hair texture, which is pretty thick, or if it&#x27;s a global result. The color is nice though. It starts a little dark, but in the sun it&#x27;s practically electric blue. It looks really nice combined with the rest of my hair which is burgundy, but doesn&#x27;t look too good against darker ash browns.</li>
    <li> excellent color. doesn&#x27;t stay as long as the manic panic, but the manic panic colors are not true, so this one&#x27;s better. it&#x27;s exactly the color i wanted, and 2 jars into manic panic, neither one of them is right.</li>
    <li> Only lasted one wash before it faded almost completely and is VERY hard to bleach out completely. I enjoy Jerome Russel&#x27;s punky colour, ion, and directions so much better</li>
    <li> Great color. Lasts at least 4 weeks true color then fades to vibrant blue which lasts for another 4 to 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> I love this color and it could keep longer.Comparing with what I bought the brand before, I love it very much.</li>
    <li> No idea why this is called Blue Mayhem. It should be called Dark Lavender... hey, they created a new color!</li>
    <li> Great color.  This particular brand is also my favorite semi-permanent hair dye.</li>
