<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t 😞.won&#x27;t ever order again.it made my hair hard.</li>
    <li> It is too soon to tell if this product would work for me (for my hair).  The smell isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
    <li> I am yet to see results on this one but I am hopeful.</li>
    <li> We (especially my husband) were very skeptical while buying this product and hence waited long to see if it works before writing a review. We have been using it for over a year now. My husband had been losing a lot of hair due to stress and other health issues and that&#x27;s the reason I thought of trying out this product. This oil has a strong smell but sweet like any other Indian herbal oils. My husband has new hair growth on areas of scalp where hair didn&#x27;t exist for couple of months. His hair also looks thicker than before.&lt;br /&gt;He uses this oil 2-3 times a week and massages his scalp gently with his fingers for 5-10 minutes. He leaves the oil on the hair overnight and washes it off with shampoo in the morning. I use this oil once once a week.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend an old t-shirt or a thick old pillow cover to put on the pillow, so that the oil from the hair does not soil the pillow. Also covering the head with a scarf or cap helps the oil to be absorbed better by the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Another good thing is that the base of the oil is sesame oil and not mineral oil like in many other hair oils.&lt;br /&gt;It has a calming effect and helps me to sleep better. I would totally recommend it to anyone wanting healthy hair and better sleep.</li>
    <li> Excellent product I will reorder.[[ASIN:B003XGYTQE Brahmi-Amla Oil, 8 oz, Bazaar of India]] The fragrance is mild, easily absorbed into my hair and is not heavy I really like this product and will reorder it again. Fast , prompt delivery from Bazaar of India.</li>
    <li> This oil is great for thin/ fine hair. I have tried olive oil in the past and it left my hair super greasy even after I washed it. The Amla oil does not leave hair greasy and washes out easy. My hair is soft and really shines after using the oil. I put it on dry hair at night two times a week. I wrap in a old shirt and sleep with the oil on. In the morning wash for beautiful hair!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Brahmi Oil a few months ago and it works wonders on my scalp and hair. My hair is soft and my scalp feels hydrated. The dandruff is also gone. So, naturally when I saw the Brahmi Amla Hair Oil, I decided to give it a try. I drink the Amla Juice (also purchased from Amazon) and it does wonders for my skin and overall wellbeing. The product arrived on time and was packed very well. I will continue to use the product and give periodic updates. Hopefully with picture results of my hair. The Seller is very polite and extremely helpful. I will use them again.</li>
    <li> I have 3C/4A natural hair and I consistently get 1 inch + using this product. The smell is terrible, but I noticed that&#x27;s less intense as when I first opened the bottle. I massage a small amount on my scalp and cover with a cap for an hour as a pre-poo once a week and have it mixed with wild growth hair oil, megatek, castor oil, and coconut oil as my scalp oil. I started using the Brahmi Amla oil before using anything else and I notice my hair was thicker and fuller each week. I get the growth \\&quot;itchies\\&quot; when using this alone. I like that the ingredients don&#x27;t include the junk that others do.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I decided to purchase this oil.  My hair has been breaking and I have noticed that it is thinning so I was looking for something that would help to thicken my hair.  Since most reviews commented on increased body, that helped to make a decision.  I just applied this oil to my hair for the first time, and oh the softness, I also like the smell.  The instruction say to use it for 1-4 months to see the difference, so in about 4 months I will be able to comment on my progress.</li>
    <li> First of all it doesn&#x27;t smell bad like some of the reviews say and I have a very keen sense of smell. Even if you put your nose to the bottle, then and only then can you smell the scent.  I am new to using oils in my natural hair. I am trying to get my hair to grow and it is a very slow process. After reading various reviews I have made my decision to try these oils.  It&#x27;s an oil. It&#x27;s too soon to tell if this is doing anything. I am using other oils like jojoba oil, coconut oil, emu oil etc. but not necessarily all at the same time. It does take time to see if these oils are doing anything. With the Vadik Herbs Brahmi-Amla Oil...I do not rinse it out because it doesn&#x27;t stink! I do not use a lot of it because it can be greasy if you use too much. Less is best. Its not even a month yet, so I can&#x27;t say if this oil is helping with the growth nor is my grey hair around the edges getting dark. But I will use it up and decide if I need to bother making a future purchase.</li>
    <li> A little dab will do!!!! Your hair will feel softer too.</li>
    <li> I bought two of Bazaar of India&#x27;s Brahmi-Amla Oil and the Amla Oil which are both good for hair application. I use both these oils in separate application since the Amla Oil which has a recommended 8-hour application. Both these oils are mineral-oil free and in most of the other user reviews you would read about the scent of the oils, however, this is a very minor issue unless you plan to walk around all day and have people sniffing your hair/head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is little to no scent when compared to other hair products/oil that you would come across and once you see and feel the difference the oil has on your hair you would overlook this simple issue of scent when weighing the pros and cons. This 8oz bottle will go a long way as it is generally recommended to use a small amount to coat you hair and massage the scalp I usually dip the tip of my finger into the bottle and this amount works just fine and will not soil your clothing or covers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this about three times since I&#x27;ve gotten it.  I massage it into my scalp, place a shower cap &amp; scarf on, &amp; keep it in overnight.  The next morning I wash it out.  What I like about it is that it deep conditions my hair, wonderfully, &amp; leaves it soft &amp; very manageable.  I&#x27;m African American, w/natural 4A/B hair... it&#x27;s thick, kinky/curly.  I do this regimen every other week.</li>
    <li> Greetings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am taking the time to write this review to express my appreciation for this product!  I have long natural hair that has never been processed.  With that being said however, I noticed a remarkable difference in my hair color and strength AFTER incorporating this product into my routine.  I will continue to purchase this product.  In fact, I&#x27;m going to purchase another bottle now!</li>
    <li> Brahmi Amla oil by vadik herbs is the best brahmi amla oil. It doesn&#x27;t contain mineral oil or carzy chemicals and perservatives. Some people are put off by the scent, but if you were brought up around frankincese and myrrh incense then the scent won&#x27;t bother you. I am completely addicted to this product because it has made my hair stronger and healthy. If you have problems with breakage and slow growth I would absolutely recommend this product. Thank You vadik herbs for producing a high quality natural product!!!!!</li>
    <li> This oil is sesame oil based and smells like roses. It&#x27;s very light and I love the fact that natural ingredients have been used. I&#x27;ve used it once and I love it.</li>
    <li> this is an indian oil its scent is not that pungnet its a exotic warm and herby scent,the oil is like an organic type of thing,you must message to the scalp only or else it will be to much you cant over oil its not neccessarly, thick oil its almost runny,but a good hair nourisher,use it at least 2 times a week,i have been using it for over 10 months,the back growth was longer then when i have been using it my side growth is getting longer and the front growth started to come back and is growing hair, where it was slowing down,again oil the scalp then the oil will eventually incorporate in the hair or by brushing the hair, this product on 5 stars i would give a 3 star after using it for several months i see results, if you want to use it daily wash hair weekly it is good for children as well its lite and will keep licw away or dandiff hair stands down like if gravity was pulling it down dont over oil then you will see results, after using it flat iron hair/ or blow dry it i recommend that for men and woman and style as usual,or oil scalp and brush it through add water to hair strands enough to work with the oil or dampen or oil scalp nad put a bag on it let it set and then after that brush, but any one whom uses it blow drying after is good and your hair will appear as sheened good luck on purchasing this oil its good for every hair type.</li>
    <li> Greetomgs.  Well I just commenced with product and I still can not rate it 100%.  I just can say the the smell of this product is horrible, but I do not care if, is really going to work.  The way I use it is in the night.  I add a small portion in my hair and messages it then I sleep with it. I use twice every two days only in the night.  I just want to know if I am doing it right and if with this product I have to combine it with something else.  My hair start falling when I went to a depresion and you do not image the money I spend, which I am sill payng.  The treatments was only for one year and do that I was so despert I decided to go through this program in order to stop my hair falling down.  It did stop falling my hair, but after a year without the treatement it start falling again. So, I decided in sarch someting through the internet someting that will help me out. The Rogain, did not work, coconut oil either.  So I keep searching and I found this product and when I start raeading the testimony from other people,I decided to buy it.  And as I said, I just commence using it and right now I can say that it is workng, but I can&#x27;t admit 100% yet, until I continue using it. At this present time my rating is fear. I have to wait until, I can see all the result. Thanks for requesting this opportunity to share my personal opinion.</li>
    <li> Great smell and light-weight. I love that it is light-weight and does not change the effectiveness of other styling products I use after using this.</li>
    <li> I chose this oil because I don&#x27;t like mineral oil and almost everything has mineral oil in it. The first ingredient is sesame seed oil, along with neem, brahmi, amla, and other traditional Indian oils. The smell is awesome!!! It has an exotic Indian aroma. I use just a small amount daily and around the third day I wash it out. My scalp is no longer dry! I love this oil. Finally, something good for your hair without mineral oil. Also, the delivery was really fast.</li>
    <li> I have used this oil three times as a hot oil treatment.  I love how soft and conditioned my hair feels once the oil has been washed out. As an African American women who is natural, it makes my hair manageable.  I will do a hot oil treatment weekly and I am looking for some hair growth and thickening.  This oil came on time and no problems with the packaging or the bottle.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Brahmi/Amla Oil stops my hair fall which was very bad. It has strengthened my hair and made it more manageable and contributes to hair growth. [[ASIN:B003XGYTQE Vadik Herbs Brahmi-Amla Oil - 8 oz]] This is a good product for anyone with hair fall and especially African American women .Thank you.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and received it in the timeframe. I love using this product. The package was well wrapped and everything was just right.</li>
    <li> My wife tried many different kinds from Indian stores and health food stores. This is the only one that is best applied as a treatment before shampooing. Needs to be massaged in and left on for 4-5 hours. After washing, the hair appears full-bodied and is soft and smooth to the touch--including the grey strands.</li>
    <li> only been using it for a week.  But so far I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and it does NOT smell bad.  It just smells like oil.  I thought it would smell disgusting.  It smells like herbs.  I like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it would come with a way to dispense it (squeeze bottle, perhaps?)  It&#x27;s just an open bottle, so you have to be careful if you only want a little bit, as a lot comes out at once.</li>
    <li> I used this product as instructed, left it in for over 30 minutes.  But as soon as I washed it out, I saw absolutely no difference in my hair.  Not worth it at all.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. I recently started new Locs and I&#x27;m almost getting an inch of new growth monthly. It does take a minute to get used too,as far as the tingly sensation, but you can also dilute it with other light oils that you might prefer. I did put it in another bottle for easy application. The other bottle has that little top that has the nozzle. It&#x27;s like the nozzle used for applying color.</li>
    <li> AWESOME!  I have been using this oil interchangeably with Leven Rose Jojoba Oil and experiencing magnificent results.  They are both so wonderful I can&#x27;t tell you which one would be my favorite!  So I will continue to buy both!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This seemed like a promising product to me. I didn&#x27;t have it very long but right away I knew i wouldn&#x27;t like it. I bought it in hopes to help grow my hair longer and keep it darker. I didn&#x27;t notice anything different when using it. I also wasn&#x27;t very fond of the smell. Like a cheap perfume. I love using oils in my hair (being mixed with black and indian) hot oil treatments were essential in my house as a kid. This oil however came in a plastic bottle (I was hoping for glass....especially with the price of the product). I guess it was so-so of an oil. I didn&#x27;t get softer hair, it just made it a bit shiny and smelled like old lady perfume.</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like sesame oil.  The fragrance is something I like.  I put a lot on and leave it over night only twice for the past 2 months since I got it and today I got compliment on how healthy my hair looks.  I guess it does work.  I also noticed that my hair does not fall as much as it used to so I&#x27;m going to keep on using this.</li>
    <li> The seal was removed and the oil was very diluted. I just spoke with Vadik Herbs, and this oil leaves their facility with a seal. The bottle I reveived is all refined sesame oil, no herbs.   Buy directly from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I have 3A-3B hair that&#x27;s been aging with the rest of me, and my hair had been getting excessively dry and I wanted to get my big curl thing back, and grow more hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not really sure that it&#x27;s helping grow hair but my hair looks healthier now that I use it. Scalp feels very healthy. I use it as an oil treatment and as a pre shampoo. Very light, no stickiness/tackiness as it is easily absorbed by hair and whatever excess washes out easy. The sell is great, very natural; anise like scent that isn&#x27;t perfume or overpowering. I started blending this with high quality rosemary essential oils and my hair started to grow faster and more profusely! (doTerra, Young Living and Eden Botanicals make the best quality rosemary if you&#x27;re wondering). I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love the way this stuff smell. Smells like roses! A great product that isn&#x27;t heavy. I feel that my hair has grown since I started using it. I use it about an hour before my shower and then I use a bit after I braid my hair. My sister recommend it to me and I&#x27;m glad I took her suggestion.</li>
    <li> I have used this oil for almost 7 months and find that it&#x27;s nothing special. I looked at the reviews and could have sworn I purchased something different if I didn&#x27;t know better. It&#x27;s a heavy oil for my medium thick hair. I am also suspicious of the color of the oil because I don&#x27;t see anything other than the sesame oil in there. I will use the rest up for what I paid and stick with coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for about 2.5 months on natural afor textured hair. I use it for a hot oil and every other day just to seal in moisture. I personally like the smell. It reminds me of chai tea and another person at work told me the exact same thing. It leaves your hair dark and shiny without being greasy. My hair absorbs it pretty well. Also I find my actual hair strands are stronger and more supple. I haven&#x27;t noticed that my hair grew any faster than usual but we&#x27;ll see. I gave some to my mother who has relaxed hair and she also found it left her hair very shiny. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> For anyone wondering, the ingredients are: Organic sesame seed oil, Brahmi (gotu kola), Amla (Indian gooseberry), Ashwagandha (withania somnifera), Turmeric (curcuma longa), Bringraj (eclipta alba), Gokshura (tribulus terrestris), Bala (sida cordifolia), Neem (azadirachta indica), Purnarnava (boerhavia diffusa), Shatawari (asparagus racemosa), Essential oil fragrance.</li>
    <li> I heard about this oil from my sister in law, who is from Nepal.  She has the prettiest hair you have ever seen.  She swears by it and uses it everyother day to massage into her hair and scalp.  Surprisingly, her hair is never greasy. I got this and I love it. Since my hair is not thick, I use it every few days.  I also mix it with black castor oil as pre shampoo conditioning oil blend.  Your hair will come out so soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Bottle was not sealed. Oil was leaking out</li>
    <li> Love it. It made my hair more manageable and shiner...</li>
    <li> I wanted to use more oils in my hair. So far I like it.  I massage it into my scalp and hair (my hair is very long, to the middle of my back).  Then I braid my hair with the oil in it and sleep with it on overnight.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy even though I leave it on all night.  I wash it in the morning and my hair seems shinier and perhaps even darker.  Of course this is time consuming, and I have to plan when I will wash my hair, but it&#x27;s worth it so far.  I&#x27;ve been doing this once a week for over a month or two and my bottle is still half full so it lasts a long time too.  I will definitely re-purchase when I run out.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great but does very little for hair growth in the short-term. Long-term? Who knows. Probably doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for the smell but it really prevents hair fall, I use as a pre poo/hot oil treatment and massage my scalp. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair soft when I applied it to my wet hair. Once my hair dried it was like straw. I tried applying to dry hair and it made my hair break unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Love it. I&#x27;ve already noticed hair growth after 30 days.</li>
    <li> Great stimulant for hair growth. Stimulates follicles thus promoting hair growth and texture. My c hair became very soft. I use it as a hot oil treatment every week and my hair love it! It is light, the smell goes away very soon. So oooo soft!</li>
    <li> Using this product has given my hair so much body. I am a woman of color who happens to have thick, coarse hair. I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is actually stronger and thicker since using Brahmi-Amla Oil. It&#x27;s like medicine for the hair and scalp. My hair also seems to be growing faster (a much needed relaxer is due sooner than usual).  Brahmi-Amla Oil has a strong smell so be sure to follow the application instructions. This stuff works!</li>
    <li> This oil is very sticky to me.  I just use it as a pre-poo over night</li>
    <li> I love this oil, it smells great and make my hair feel very soft. I also mix it with a few other oil I use on my hair and works well with them. I will be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Amla oil is one of many that I&#x27;ve tried. This oil did not have the richness of others I have tried like castor or olive oils. It is a lighter texture and when I used it as a pre-shampoo oil treatment,  it seemed to sit on the surface. I also noticed my hair still felt dry after the treatment.  I&#x27;ll look for other ways to use it so as not to waste money but for now I am less than impressed.</li>
    <li> Good but don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> strong smell.. but its very good.</li>
    <li> I just got the oil today, so I can&#x27;t say anything about hair-growth, but I definitely plan to keep using it. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a little heavy for everyday use on my hair, but it&#x27;ll make a great pre-shampoo conditioner. (I kind of expected it to be a little heavy because of the sesame base).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is much more mild than I&#x27;d expected, given some of the other reviews. It&#x27;s not my favorite scent in the world, but I can hardly notice it (and it&#x27;s really not awful, just not something I would wear for fragrance alone). My husband said it smelled \\&quot;citrusy\\&quot;. The strongest scent to me is the neem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might try a coconut based oil for daily use, but I&#x27;m excited to see how this one works long term.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this product for hair growth, since my hair is thin, lank, and grows slowly on top of that. Because of this, it also accumulates grease very quickly. Because of this I was a bit skeptical to add even more oil on my scalp! Well, I tried this as an overnight hot oil treatment and the next morning after I shampooed and dried I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my hair,it felt so soft!! And no nasty build up! Some people have commented on the smell and the only thing that I have to add to that is the thing that really sticks out to me is the sesame seed base, which seems to be the strongest. However, as someone else noted the smell seems to diminish after the first time you open the bottle. I noticed that when I washed it out with an organic shampoo (to which I&#x27;d added just a few drops of bergamot essential oil as it has anti-fungal properties), the smell is actually quite nice. It just smells really natural and pleasant. I&#x27;ve been using this for about three months, along with a biotin supplement, and have noticed faster-than-average hair growth. I think I can attribute at least some of this growth to having taken better care of my scalp and the more immediate result of the oil is really soft, smooth, shiny hair without having to use the salon leave-in conditioners and masques that seem to leave behind build up.</li>
    <li> This oil has very good ingredients but it makes my head itch every time I use it! I gave it 4 stars because of the ingredients</li>
    <li> I agree with another reviewer to use a cap or something to keep your pillowcase from being soiled. At night I sleep with this oil on &amp; it turned my pillow case green until it was washed out. The oil did not stain.&lt;br /&gt;Now to my review, this oil is wonderful for making my hair silky smooth &amp; full of body. I love the scent of this oil, also it is calming &amp; helps me sleep.&lt;br /&gt;On the top of my head I&#x27;ve lost hair due to stress &amp; illness as well. In the past nothing has helped so i read up on oils such as this one &amp; decided to give it a try. I really love the fact that this oil has only natural ingredients in it, without all the fillers, water &amp; mineral oil. You really do get a great product with this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;This is really a great product. I have recommended it to family &amp; friends.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003XGYTQE Brahmi-Amla Oil, 8 oz, Bazaar of India]] I Purchased this product because of all of the good reviews I just received it today and put some in my hair and massaged it on my scalp, I have natural curly hair which is about 8 1/2 inch long, I purchased this in hopes to get thicker and darker hair. I plan on using this products everyday and washing my hair every week, I wash (NO SULFATE) and condition my hair only using natural products so my hair is very healthy After a month I will write another review on the progress of my hair. I&#x27;m only giving it a 2 star because I can&#x27;t quite rate it yet.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.I am noticing growth on where i lost my hair earlier.&lt;br /&gt;Its been almost 2 months since i am using this oil and will give another few months to see the difference and update the comments...</li>
    <li> Read the reviews from others and so far so good.  I notice a difference in my hair after the first use.  I add this oil to the Brahmi powder and notice my hair is not so dry and feels healthy.</li>
    <li> This oil isn&#x27;t thick like Jamaican castor oil and not as light as Argan, it&#x27;s somewhere in the middle. I like that there really isn&#x27;t a powerful smell to this (on the light musk side). I put it on pre-shampoo at night with some tea tree oil. It&#x27;s not greasy and soaks into my scalp nicely.</li>
    <li> My hair is doing so much better since I switched to using an Ayurvedic hair care system, and using this oil has helped my hair so much on wash day.  I usually massage it into my hair and cover with a plastic conditioning cap,with a satin bonnet over it, overnight .  The next day I will then coat my hair with a mixture of a few of the Hesh Pharma hair powders I&#x27;ve bought from amazon and leave on an additional few hours.  Then I wash everything out with two separate conditioners (whatever natural non-chemical conditioner I have on hand).  It&#x27;s messy and time-consuming but I do it for the good of one day having healthy hair!</li>
    <li> Lovely smell. I use it just before I wash my hair and it leaves it glossy and soft.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair, and I take really good care of it, but it&#x27;s still dry, frizzy, and porous. It gets really tangled, and so it breaks, and I&#x27;d lose quite a bit in the shower. None of these issues really bothered me (curlies lose a lot more hair in the shower because fallen hair stays tangled in curls instead of falling off throughout the day), but I wanted to make my hair healthier, and I really wanted it to grow. I suffered a horrible haircut two years ago and my hair still hasn&#x27;t grown to the length it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I used castor oil + almond oil twice, and tried castor oil + brahmi oil last weekend, and it is really amazing. My hair looks SO much shinier, and it&#x27;s not nearly as frizzy, and I barely lost any hair in the shower. All that after only one use!&lt;br /&gt;But here&#x27;s the downside: the smell is VILE! It smells SO repugnant, and it STAYS in your hair after you wash it, after it dries, and each morning after I wet my curls. So disgusting! I almost feel self conscious to let my hair down cuz every time the wind blows, I can smell this stuff faintly.&lt;br /&gt;However, this is my personal opinion. The smell is a weird, sickly sweet almost (but not quite) floral scent, but it is very strong. I&#x27;m gonna ask a bunch of my friends to smell my hair and tell me if it is as bad as I think it is.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m gonna try mixing it with tea tree or citrus essential oil and see if that helps at all.&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re wondering if this is for you, TRY IT! It&#x27;s amazing for hair, minus the smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been experiencing sudden and diffuse hair loss and have tried a bunch of products at this point. This oil smells fine although a bit strong, but after I use it my hair gets so oily that it&#x27;s impossible to go out in public so I did it only at night. However, I needed to wash twice (basically overwash my hair which is bad for it especially while falling) to get the oil out. So, I&#x27;m not sure if there is any benefit if you then have to use extra shampoo to get it out of the hair. I did not see any difference in terms of moisture or hair improvement but I did not use it on a regular basis. Perhaps for people who are not undergoing any hair loss issues and simply want to improve the quality of their hair it would work. I got the same effect from trying other oils, such as emu oil and coconut oil heated with curry leaves which I prepared at home.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting much from this product, but I was pleasantly surprised that after one overnight application, my hair looked much healthier and shinier.  I was concerned about being unable to sleep with this stuff on my head, but the oil absorbed pretty quickly and I was barely aware that it was on my head.  It&#x27;s too soon to see any additional growth, but I like the results so far just from the improved health of my hair.  The only thing that seems strange is that this oil barely has any scent.  All the reviews I&#x27;ve read say that Brahmi Amla oil is very pungent, but not this particular bottle.  I ordered a second bottle from another seller, and that one has a very strong aroma, which is actually kind of pleasant.  I don&#x27;t know if the lack of scent indicates that this bottle is old -there is no expiration date on it - but I will be using my second bottle for the time being and see what happens.</li>
    <li> This oil is by far the best hair conditioner I have ever tried. I haven&#x27;t seen any hair growth yet. Every time I use it it leaves my hair shiny and very soft making my hair look very healthy.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It does not have a bad order to it. It makes my hair grow and it leaves my hair  really soft after I wash the oil out.</li>
    <li> I use this oil during my prepoo and to 3 times a week for scalp messages. I use this oil in everyone&#x27;s hair in my home.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait a month of usage before I reviewed. I absolutely love this product. It is very thick which is great for my hair. My hair was a mess. I suffered from hair loss around my edges because of multiple hair weave installs. My hair has high porosity. I also suffered from dandruff, itchy and dry scalp.&lt;br /&gt;This product keeps my hair moisturized, soft and shiny. Most importantly it is growing healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I typically put it on at night because the smell can be strong. I don&#x27;t mind it nor does my husband.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly the shipping was super fast!! Gotta love that</li>
    <li> This is a nice oil to apply to the scalp.  I have not had long enough to really see the results of hair growth.  However, I like the way it makes my scalp feel.</li>
    <li> This oil is lovely and works nicely on my hair. Smells beautiful too. It&#x27;s really expensive but I assume that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s pure oil with no additives. In India Amla oil costs a fraction of this but it has other ingredients which may not benefit people looking to use purely natural products. I usually mix this oil with coconut and bhringraj oils, I heat the mix and then apply it on my scalp and hair roots warm. I leave it for a few hours before shampooing. What I like about this oil is that it is not greasy and has a lovely smell apart from its wonderful qualities. If you can afford it, buy it, your hair will look awesome with regular use.</li>
    <li> Good product helped with thin hair. I would recomend this product to an who might be having a thinning of hair.</li>
    <li> It smells nice but the main ingredient is sesame oil. It&#x27;s a very thick oil that coats the hair but doesn&#x27;t seem to penetrate it well. It&#x27;s more like a massage oil feel which seems a bit too much for my hair. There are better products with authentic Indian ingredients. It&#x27;s not at all what I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> The delivery was awesome &amp;&amp;&amp; I&#x27;m pre pooing now yeah the smell.. but that&#x27;S okay as long as I get the results I&#x27;m counting on &#x3D;) thicker sides &amp;&amp; edges &#x3D;) it&#x27;s gonna happenin... has no choice but to happen &#x3D;) thank you :)</li>
    <li> great stuff, my hair thanks you.  LOL</li>
    <li> I didnt buy it I&#x27;m just here to say that this is a conditioner, I was confused at 1st</li>
    <li> The bottle says brahmi awla but contains a whooole ton of other ingredients (unnecessary ingredients). I use a lot of herbal products and was looking for pure awla oil (for premature graying). It has the smell, feel and quality of commercially available oil. I was expecting a more raw home made pure ayurvedic feel. Not buying again.</li>
    <li> makes hair hard and dry if left in pass time directed but good i, guess still using it good smell</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful without added toxins. Does not make my skin break out either. Hair is very soft and sleek now.</li>
    <li> I use the Vadik Brahmi-Alma Oil to prepoo my hair every time prior to co-washing or shampooing. The scent isn&#x27;t bad at all as some has posted. My hair is thriving with this oil. Thanks Amazon!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love.  Keep my hair very smooth.  It does not run all over my neck or my face.  Love the consistency.  I love the smell too.</li>
    <li> Great oil, smells good and really works...already can feel the difference in few days....must try!</li>
    <li> so far I&#x27;ve been using this oil for maybe like month now, and I definitely have seen good results. I can tell there is growth on my head because of the texture on my roots. I&#x27;d say I have maybe 1-2 inches of growth or 1-1 1/2 inches. I also got help from taking specific vitamins but this stuff definitely did its part! I do have to complain that it&#x27;s quite pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it for longer healthier hair!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any of the claims that they&#x27;ve mentioned in the bottle. Want a long, healthy, shiny, voluminous and soft hair. Mix organic castor oil with coconut oil and few drops of e-oil. Massage your scalp with it and leave it for an hour or longer and then rinse it with a good clarifying hair shampoo. After that mix a table spoon of your favorite hair mask with a hair conditioner leave it for 3 to 5 minutes while cleansing and exfoliating your body. Then rinse it and you&#x27;ll feel the difference from the 1st usage. Offer this hair - spa treatment your scalp once a week and inshallah you&#x27;ll live your dream hair soon and forever.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 3 months.  I did not see much new hair growth, but I did notice new hair growth after I finished this oil and switched to Bhringraj oil from the same supplier.  I noticed new hair growth a few weeks after starting on Bhringraj and it was too early for Bhringraj to take effect (it takes 1-2 months for any hair treatment), so must be the benefit from the prior use of Brahmi-Amla.  I now think that maybe the results with Brahmi-Amla were delayed because I used it in the winter, when hair grow slower anyway.  Prior to that, I used Brahmi oil from the same supplier in the fall, and saw new hair growth after 2 months of usage.  I was using both products in the same way - oiling overnight 2-3 times a week, washing off in the morning with ayurvedic herbs.  I am rating this oil a 4 because I am still not completely sure why it was the least effective of the three oils I had used so far.  I will post the review for the Bhringraj oil when I am done with it.</li>
    <li> Just started using this oil, like the way it smells, need more time to see if it works, think that it will</li>
    <li> Second time purchasing this for my hair loss. Love this product. I think the scent us pleasant. Use a quarter size amount 2 or 3 times a week and leave it in my hair when I sleep. Definitely helps.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product great on you edges. I wear lace wigs and found that my edges were thinning...applied this and they were back to normal so now it&#x27;s a part of my hair regimen. I still wear lace wigs but I don&#x27;t have the problem with thinning edges anymore.</li>
    <li> Even though the smell is very very slightly annoiying.. Your hair will grow&#x27; well mine is growing.. I have dreadlocs(locs) and my hair is clean fresh and happy.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It does smell good and restores hair moisture. My hair looks so much better. It&#x27;s amazing. I also feel that it promotes hair growth. My scalp feel better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started my 2nd bottle a week ago. I noticed the scent was different but realized it smelled like roses. I love the new scent.  The 1st bottle had a relaxing scent to it. I liked it. But I also like the new scent of roses. I have been very satisfied with the results on my hair.</li>
    <li> The Brahmi-Amla oil I received was watered down and smelled like rose water. When I applied the oil to my hair, it left my hair looking dull. My hair also felt very brittle. I have used Brahmi-Alma oil before and I am convinced that I received something else.</li>
</ol>
