<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> He crave detangling brush  does the job of detangling but it was difficult  to hold and maneuver.</li>
    <li> Every single morning, as the black rubber pad falls out of this, as I release the curler, I wonder how on earth this thing got so many raving reviews.  I have never in my life had an eyelash curler that the rubber pad fell out of it every single time.  I just don&#x27;t get the hype.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Comfortable and easy to  use.  No pinching or pain.  Creates beautiful and natural curl.</li>
    <li> Great product with replaceable pads - perfect for keeping the product sanitary for eye use. Fabulously designed box and a convenient latch to keep curler closed and safe while in transit. Creates a nice subtle curl to lashes that create a natural look.</li>
    <li> This product is pure genius!  The funky design on the box and &amp;#34;Whip Lash&amp;#34; name give the buyer an idea that this isn&#x27;t just your ordinary, everyday, run-of-the-mill eyelash curler.  Which is correct.&lt;br /&gt;Because I&#x27;ve always been &amp;#34;challenged&amp;#34; when it comes to eyelash curling, I was hesitant to try this at first, for fear I&#x27;d accidentally remove my already sparse eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;Wrong! It couldn&#x27;t have been any easier to use!  And it comes with extra cushion pads.&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous cosmetic tool at a great price.</li>
    <li> I just got this and used wight away as I was going out. I had gotten tips as a follow up that really made sense and helped. They were right about the  blow dryer. It works great. The Secrets of Getting a Perfect Curl:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Always curl your lashes before putting on mascara. This prevents the lashes from sticking to the curler which can cause them to be pulled out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Keep your lash curler clean at all times. This helps protect the eyelashes and also your eye from getting an infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. A makeup artist once shared this tip with me: heat the lash curler up with your blow dryer for 5-10 seconds. Touch it to make sure it’s not too hot and then use the warmed up curler to curl your lashes. You must be careful that the curler it not too hot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It doesn’t hurt to pump the curler to get a stronger curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Last, finish with one or two coats of mascara.</li>
    <li> Love it! Nicely made! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These are great curlers however I swapped out their rubber piece with a regular one. The original one they have has an indent cut into it so when you pinch your lashes it creates a more defined curl. It does work great but I found for me it seemed to catch my lashes in that indent and pulled some out when I released the clamp. I tried being more gentle when I&#x27;d close the curlers but in the end just switched the rubber piece for a regular one from my old curler and prefer that. Personal preference. They&#x27;re very ergonomic to use, I like the extra finger rests on the handles and also the piece that holds them shut, fits in the drawer easier. I&#x27;ve had mine for a couple months and the other week one of the looped finger holes half snapped off. They&#x27;re still usable but not as easy to use with the broken piece, I have to be extra careful or else my finger slips off.  I&#x27;d read reviews on similar issues and they recommended emailing the company directly with good customer service reviews as well. I did that but almost 2 wks later still have not gotten a response.</li>
    <li> Great quality and really sturdy. It worked great and the curl last a long time. Better than I expected. I would recommend this eyelash curler to everyone.</li>
    <li> Did not get any replacement pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did get an email from the company before the curler even arrived reporting that they would send ten pads as they were trying to do damage control based on previous reviews that pads do not last  long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it twice.  It is very gentle and gives a nice natural curl.  Definitely better than standard drug store options.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product, but unfortunately this curler did not work out for me. The top edges of the curler were sharp and it hurt to use the curler on my lashes. Crave Naturals said they would replace the item and refund me.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple of months ago.  It was FANTASTIC...at first.  Within 3 weeks, it had broken.  I&#x27;ve tried to contact the company for a replacement since they claim it&#x27;s a lifetime warranty.  No one has contacted me to even tell me to stick it.  I&#x27;ve just been ignored.  If you don&#x27;t mind spending $15 bucks every month for great looking lashes, go ahead and buy.  But me and my pocketbook just can&#x27;t afford to keep repurchasing something when it breaks in less than a month just because we like how it makes my eyes \\&quot;pop.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s sad too, because I absolutely LOVED the packaging and the curler did a great job until the welding on the side went kaput.    Edited&gt;    The company has finally contacted me and sent me a replacement.  I gave it over a month to see if it would stand the test of time and it&#x27;s still working fine.  I loved it in the first place. Glad I can love it again.  ;)</li>
    <li> Much to my dismay, the eyelash curler was already in less than adequate condition. I immediately noticed that the part where the cushion pad would go was crooked and loose. When I tried to put the cushion in it would not stay.  I tried the product and it would not curl my eyelashes.  I&#x27;m not sure if I wasn&#x27;t pressing hard enough or what, but I was afraid the top bar would cut my eyelashes off if I pressed to hard. After trying several times I gave up. When I put the curler in the lock position the top metal bridge popped off. I am very thankful this was not when I was trying to curl my eyelashes or it could have hurt my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall design of the product is nice. I like how you grip the curler, but this product seems poorly made. The cushion would not stay in place and the top metal bridge popped off after only being used a few times.  I liked that there were extra cushions in the package and there were instructions in the box.</li>
    <li> So I must first mention that I absolutely love the packaging of this eyelash curler! The eyelash curler itself  is pretty good too. It&#x27;s easy to operate and seems sturdy. It was able to grab ahold of my lashes and create a nice curve. Overall a decently priced alternative to some of the really expensive eyelash curlers out there.</li>
    <li> Love this eyelash curler so much I have already thrown my old away!  I find it to be well constructed and easy to use.  I plan on buying more for stocking stuffers for Christmas for the ladies in my family.</li>
    <li> The curler is extremely easy to use and does the job just right without chopping off your eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended 100% the curler, as well as the amazing customer support from the seller.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the best eyelash curler I have ever used! I have hooded and and I usually have a problem pinching my eye lid when I try to curl my lashes. This curler fits my eyes better and I am not having to worry about pinching my eye lid. I have already recommended this product to my friends. Try it because I promise you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> It is just okay, i probably works better if 1. you are not asian 2.you have really big eyes.</li>
    <li> I like this they said this item kind a problem with the refill but i can tell it&#x27;s not it is 100% fit and i love using it i can recommend it to every woman love to see there barbie eyelashes</li>
    <li> This curler is awesome...I recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> I really like this curler and the fact that it came with extra pads is such a bonus. I like the natural feel of the curler and the gripper to keep it locked when not in use. The many tips they sent really helped me understand hoe to use and curl my eyelashes much better. Thank you...</li>
    <li> Very thankful for the product... it&#x27;s very useful for my daughter hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful curler. my daughter and I have looked for one we like, this was our choice. Works wonwonderful, love that it&#x27;s pink And came with extra pads. I&#x27;ll be buying again. Thank you for such a great product.</li>
    <li> My lashes not being very long this curler helps make them appear larger than life. The unboxing is beautiful and looks very expensive. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this eyelash curler. I&#x27;ve had many different that pinched my eyelids, or gave my eyelashes a weird crease mark. I love this curler, it does an amazing job, the replacement pads are an added bonus so I know I can have this curler for years to come</li>
    <li> Great curler!!  I have hooded eyes (my upper eyelid hangs down a bit) and this is the first curler that doesn&#x27;t pinch me when I use it.  I&#x27;m so happy!  It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is a very good eyelash curler!  I love love love the packaging, and that it comes with replacement pads!  It&#x27;s made of high quality materials, spring loaded, and very easy to use!  I LOVE it, and wish I would&#x27;ve found it earlier:)</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  I used it on my dry hair (without the benefit of a detangling conditioner) and it did an excellent job without bursting my hair.  It is the best.</li>
    <li> I used this Whip lash curler a few times, I like it. When I first opened it, I&#x27;m not going to lie, I thought I may have made a mistake in buying it. It seemed poorly made, I was wrong. I really like it after trying it. I liked it even more after seeing extra rubber things (you know, those rubber things ) Anyway, I&#x27;m glad I bought it. Curl away~~</li>
    <li> Curls nicely. Comes with plenty of rubber pieces to change out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many eyelash curlers in my day, so trust this review! This was my first time to try more than a dollar store type curler. I assumed they were all similar. I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is excellent. It&#x27;s inexpensive compared to some, and more expensive compared to most, but definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grips are comfortable and it didn&#x27;t snag my lashes like cheaper ones do.</li>
    <li> The Pink Eyelash Curler was not best at not pinching or sticking. Besides that it was okay to use when your on your way to work.</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash curler.  It does not pinch or catch or rip your lashes out. I love that it comes with extra eyelash pads. It&#x27;s always a Headache when you need to change the eyelash pad and can&#x27;t find any around. This is a must have</li>
    <li> Please do not buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Eyelash Curler makes your eyelash fall out when you attempt to curl your lashes. also it pinches your eye lid and it&#x27;s so annoying. if i could give this zero stars i would. Please be aware and careful. This is a Rip off . Please look for a different Eyelash curler and not buy this one.</li>
    <li> I received this package after work, washed my face &amp; tried it. I have never been happier with an eyelash curler! Way way better than all the curlers i have been using. Will keep using this product definitely!</li>
    <li> I bought this one to replace a cheap one I purchased previously.  This is a really nice eyelash curler.  Heavy duty and well made.</li>
    <li> It is awesome really luv it was looking for something new and this pink eyelash curler fulfilled my expectations it is great!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely worst curler I have bought.</li>
    <li> This was awesome.  I loved it.  I was so pleased that it came with replacement pads.  Had a great feeling about it...&lt;br /&gt;Until a couple of weeks ago when it broke while I was using it.  The metal came apart where the curler is soldered together.  It was possibly one of the most unpleasant experiences my eyelashes have endured.  Extremely disappointing, seemingly dangerous, and apparently cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not cool, whiplash.</li>
    <li> We love the Wet Brush for my Maltese!  It glides through their hair getting out all the tangles!</li>
    <li> actually curls my asian eyelashes and keeps them curled. this eyelash curler makes the difference</li>
    <li> Pinches!! And handle broke right away. Doesnt even curl right:)</li>
    <li> It is not getting all of my lashes like my previous curler. It is also pretty bulky to be using in a delicate area. I poked myself in the eye every time I used it and I have 15+ years experience with eyelash curlers. I will be returning to my previous curler. Also the picture displays pink curler pads all the ones I got were black. Seams good quality, however I have only used it 3 times and it will live the rest of its days burried deep in a junk drawer.</li>
    <li> I received  this eyelash curler to try out for the basis of this review. The following information, is 100% mine and my opinion alone.  I have not used an eyelash curler in a long time, but all the hype these days seems to be on long beautiful lashes so thought I would try it.  I have used mine multiple times and every time, I have had a nice uplifting curl to the lash.  Make sure when you use this, you DO NOT have mascara already on the lash.  This will cause the curler to stick to the lash.  Apply your mascara after you curl, as the directions tell you.  Also, being a makeup artist, I recommend using the blow dryer to heat the curler, just a tad.  Only do this for a few seconds, and always test the how hot the curler is before ever placing it close to your eye.  Heat allows the curl to set staying nice and perfect for the remainder of the day. I like that this curler also has the safety release latch, that easily can become detached.  I have really enjoyed using this product and notice a big difference every time I do.  Personally speaking, I would highly recommend this to others and also to my clients.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST eyelash curler I have ever used!! It gets up to the root of the eyelashes to give both short and long lashes a beautiful curl. I curl my short lashes at the base, middle and ends to give a curl that lasts all day. I will recommend this to ANYONE!!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, comfortable to grip, and it does a great job curling (not crimping) my lashes!</li>
    <li> This curler is super cute and works great. I really like the lock feature on the bottom which secures it in place.</li>
    <li> Nice to kind one that does NOT pinch my eyelids</li>
    <li> Crave Naturals is an amazing company run by beautiful people with amazing customer service, some of the best ever. I highly recommend their products and they come with a LIFETIME guarantee. Meaning that at any point if their products break they will replace them for you in an instant. The spring on my curler bounced off recently while I using it (I think it was my fault) and I contacted Crave Naturals Sunday afternoon. They responded that night and I had received a new curler in the mail MONDAY. Yes, the next day!! 10 stars!  REPLACEMENT PADS******* There seems to be issues with replacement pads, but here no worries. If you received PINK pads, contact the company. These are the old and faulty replacement pads and the company sends out an email saying people have been having trouble with replacement pads and to contact them if you do. With my first curler I received pink pads and they did not stay on the curler very well, I contacted the company and they sent me the new pads in the mail. If you received BLACK replacement pads you are all set. These are the much improved replacement pads that work wonderfully. The second curler I received had black replacement pads with it and it was all set so they are working to correct this problem. Do not worry.  This curler is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever had, better than my Shu Uemura. Plus it comes with lifetime replacement pads which Shu doesn&#x27;t. The curl from this eyelash curler is dramatic and huge. The trick to this is that the curler opens extremely wide, about half and inch or more which allows you to get very close to your roots. Be careful, you can pinch yourself! After positioning this against my roots I gently pump the curler for about seven seconds. I then move the curler down the lashes slightly and pinch and lift the handle slightly to bend them backwards. Note: this curler can give you the &amp;#34;over curled&amp;#34; effect if you push down too hard and can bend your lashes but if done properly this gives more curl than any other curler I&#x27;ve tried! I recommend combing out your lashes with a spoolie after curling to even out the curl. Even without mascara your eyelashes become instantly more noticeable after using this! HUGE curl!!  This curler also looks incredibly classy. I love the pink and the box it comes in is beautiful, there was a lot of thought put into packaging. I am extremely happy with this lash curler and I highly recommend it! You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Wife Review: I purchased this curler a few months ago when it twice the price and it was amazing!!!! I needed another one and was pleased to see that it was a lot cheaper. This cheaper one is horrible! The pad doesn&#x27;t stay on. It doesn&#x27;t curl evenly - one end of the lashes is a little curled and the other end isn&#x27;t curled at all. Whatever was done to make this curler cheaper absolutely ruined it.</li>
    <li> This is the best curler I have ever used and I have tried very high end to drugstore Revlon curlers and this one beats them all.  The customers service is very efficient and pleasant to work with, which is a plus.  I repurchased to buy one for traveling and I noticed that the black refill pads are not as nice as the pink ones that the curlers originally come with.  Maybe it is just me, but they just don&#x27;t have the same amount of give when you go to curl your lashes.  That being said, it still gets the job done!  Thanks Crave Naturals!</li>
    <li> I would have given this curler a higher rating, if the item had been sent in better packaging. My curler came in a torn bubble wrap envelope. The curler box was smashed; however, the product looked undamaged. So I used it anyway. It curled the eyelashes beautifully, but the refill pad would lift and fall  every time you release the curler. I tried replacing the pad, still falls out. I meant to have it exchanged, but time ran out. If I am not in a hurry, I will still fumble with it...darn, I  just wished I could have replaced it just to see if it is truly is a great eyelash curler or it is a truly a defective curler.   Update: March 28, 2015 I made a second attempt to emailed the company, and a wonderful customer service rep, Tamara, apologized for the inconvenience and sent me a replacement. I received the curler in record time. I used it yesterday...it is the best eyelash curler...ever! It grab all the lashes, no strays and so comfortable to use. The curl lasted all day....Oh, Excuse me, I gotta go, I am anxious to use my new lash curler for todays look...</li>
    <li> Last year I developed a thyroid disease &amp; the medication I take caused horrible problems with my hair. I had unbelievable hair loss &amp; tangled hair which made the loss worse. I had heard about the crave brush ...supposed to be a miracle for tangles.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know ehy I waited so long yo order it but thank god I finally did. It&#x27;s certainly been my miracle.! No more ripping out loads of hair . No more scary tangled rats nest. And best of all it&#x27;s helping lessen the hair loss!</li>
    <li> Great product, great seller!</li>
    <li> Super cute pink eyelash curler I loved the packaging too.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I read all the good reviews and i do love this curler. Works great!</li>
    <li> Great curler.  Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I am totally disappointed in this product. The only thing good I have tonsay is the packaging is really cute. The curler pulled my lashes out. The pads due not stay in the curler. They constantly fall out and have to be put back into the curler.  But the worst thing about this is the fact that I had this product for 6 weeks and the handle broke. I don&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews for this product. Save you money and buy a curler from the drug store.</li>
    <li> Not only Great fast delivery, but this brush and comb is amazing.  Love it, Love it,  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> CRAVE NATURALS...you DO NOT disappoint ! This eyelash curler is the best I have ever used. NO pinching. They curl the lashes beautifully&lt;br /&gt;I AM HOOKED ON CRAVE NATURALS!!.</li>
    <li> wife says: The eyelash curler itself it&#x27;s great if it is used with a good pad.  The pads that come with this tear my eyelashes out with the first use.  Although quite happy with the previous brand, I wanted to see if there was something even better. I am currently using refill pads from a Japonesque  eyelash curler purchased 2 years ago that just gave out. I don&#x27;t like that locking the curler bears down on the pad, so I don&#x27;t use the locking mechanism.  I would recommend using with better silicone pads if you can find them. Product shown comes with 10 pink refills, the product I received came with black refills.  I don&#x27;t know if this is the explains the difference in reviews I read which ranged from 1 - 5, but I felt it was worth mentioning. I do like the comfort handles.  Update:  It&#x27;s been a little over a month now. The curler broke my eyelashes. :O.    When I closed the curler to curl lashes, the top metal part of the curler slipped over the curler pad and hit the lower metal cutting my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of eyelash curlers in my life, and they all have one thing in common: they pinch my poor eyelids, seems like it happens no matter how careful I am. This one is different; it is specifically shaped not to pinch.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel like I have to press quite so hard to curl the lash so I don&#x27;t end up accidentally crimping a lash, which is not a good thing and highly abuses them. The comfort factor alone is enough to earn the higher rating on this one.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a huge pink-color-liking girl, but it is of no consequence to me. The curler seems to be reasonably well-built, and works nicely and painlessly. I have already completely quit using my Shu Uemara curler, which worked pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;What can I say, comfort is paramount to my happiness, and this curler does just that. Bonus, although not a necessity; the art on the box is like a vintage comic book, which I find somewhat appealing and cute. The company seems to be customer satisfaction oriented and eager to help.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome eyelash curler and the best I have ever used.  It curls every time and comes with refills so the product will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an eyelash curler that doesn&#x27;t lose the rubber part. I found this after research and thought it would be worth the money if I don&#x27;t have to search around my make-up bag every time I want to use - which is practically every day. I am sorry to say but I am sorely disappointed. First, the packaging is super cute. And the handles are nice. From there it goes down hill, the rubber part does not stay in the curler and when I used the part that clips the handles together the top part cut right into the rubber piece after a couple of days. So I was curling/crimping my eye lashes. Well, the handle broke and it doesn&#x27;t stay together. So, I spent my time researching, writing this review, and I could have saved time and money if I had not ordered this eyelash curler. Bummer!</li>
    <li> I love how it is very easy to use and very comfortable to hold. This is one of my must have beauty tool for my eye lashes.</li>
    <li> Works great but it didn&#x27;t blow my mind</li>
    <li> I ordered a curler for myself and one for my mom for Christmas after reading a bunch of reviews from people who loved it. I have short eyelashes that don&#x27;t curl very easily and usually use one of the cheap drugstore curlers, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  The pads keep falling out, what little lashes I do have get pulled out because they get stuck in a crease in the pads (and this happens after using the pads only a few times) and it doesn&#x27;t curl well. I actually had better results with the $3 curler I was using before this one. Not sure what all the hype is about, but I feel like I wasted $30. Mom says it doesn&#x27;t curl her lashes, either.</li>
    <li> So far, it&#x27;s awesome! I haven&#x27;t bought an eyelash curler for over a decade.  I used to use the standard metal ones you find at local drugstores and it always pinched me.  I have straight Asian eyelashes and always liked how my lashes looked curled, but never found that it really did much.  I curled my eyes in the morning for the first time in a long time and applied It&#x27;s So Big Mascara.  The whole day my eyelashes were curled and even the next morning.  (I fell asleep without washing it off.) After washing my face in the morning, lashes went back straight, but I can&#x27;t wait to use it again!</li>
    <li> I am giving this product  five stars because my six year old did not cry!  We have beautiful kinky curly hair and with that it can be very tangled after washing. I found the product for our hair, worked best when the  hair was wet with conditioner or a detangler product. Don&#x27;t not use on DRY hair it does not work! The hair must be wet and bushes out in small parts if scalp is tender and haor is super thick. You must start from the bottom and work your way up. Also I wish the handle was longer and a little firmer. I had to use the bush face up in order to pull it through the first few times. The best thing about this brush vs a comb, the hair loss was very little to almost none, and our curl pattern is amazing. It really does work!</li>
    <li> I am a woman in her fifties that had that tired old lady eyes. Low and behold this fantastic product! I bought this after trying the electric variety, expensive mascara, an other products that promised to brighten the eyes with curly lashes. This is the only product that has actually delivered as promised. I can&#x27;t believe the difference. I also must mention that the customer service is stellar and unlike any other. Thank you for this fountain of youth!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this curler a few months ago (about 3), on my moms amazon account. I loved it, I didnt have  no problems it was a great curler. I have never dropped my eyelash curler it has always been on my makeup desk with my mascaras. Last week while I was using the curler the bottom pink part broke. Thankfully I didnt jerk the movement too rough so I didnt lose any eyelashes. I dont apply much pressure to the curler so I dont understand how it broke the way it did.</li>
    <li> I bought this item based on the good reviews but im really dissapointed. i will be returning it because the pads come off after a few uses.</li>
    <li> I bought the Crave Natural hair brush and it works great. I have fine, thin hair and it tangles very easily. This brush makes it much easier to get my hair the way I like it to look in less time than a standard hair brush. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good product. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes are straight as a board and never curl!  When I use mascara it takes about 15 strokes before they curl.  It&#x27;s crazy.  With that being said it took a couple times of holding it for the count of ten before it&#x27;d hold the curl.  But after doing so, my eyelashes curled with ease with the mascara.  Only need to apply it once now!  So I use whiplash 2x (while holding for about 10 seconds each time.  Then apply my mascara and my lashes look lovely!</li>
    <li> Loved this eyelash curler when I first received it - however when replacing the rubber pads, they don&#x27;t stay in place and pop out.  I have tried locking it shut with the supplied clip (which also falls off) to keep the pad in place, but as soon as I open it to curl my lashes, the pad pops up again.  A bit frustrating.</li>
    <li> The eyelash curler itself is comfortable and to use, but the I&#x27;ve already gone through 2 of the refills ;(</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! The packaging is adorable. The curler feels nice and make of good quality material. It comes with plenty of cushion pads aswell! It&#x27;s a great buy and I will be purchasing again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a good eyelash curler. The replacement pads I received are black, though, not pink. That was really the only negative about this. They do a good job curling with no pinching, and the pads are sturdy enough that I don&#x27;t have creases in my lashes.</li>
    <li> It took a little getting used to, but once I got the hang of this eyelash curler my lashes went from blah to BOOM!!  I did receive these free for review.</li>
    <li> Works good on wet hair. Pulls with dry.</li>
    <li> No better than regular ones from Covergirl or Walgreens. Pulls eyelashes out even if directions are followed to the letter. I&#x27;ve been curling lashes for 30+ years as well.... I loved the Sonia Kashuk travel eyelash curler which worked amazingly. Over 8 years I bought 3 only because they didn&#x27;t make replacement insert refills. But now they are no longer making this curler. So sad 😩</li>
    <li> THE BEST. I used to pay so much for the Shu Uemura eyelash curlers before they stopped selling them in the US and then switched to ELF&#x27;s springed curler, which was great for a while, until it clipped off a chunk of my eyelashes. This is better than both of those why a long shot. I&#x27;ve had no issues with the pads and who even cares when you get free replacement pads for life (yes, that is something you get when you purchase this product - I think you just have to pay a couple bucks for shipping the replacements, but try to find another company that does that). Even when I don&#x27;t wear mascara this holds such a serious, glamorous curl in my lashes (even after a nap). I&#x27;m totally impressed and in love. Plus, what a cute name!</li>
    <li> Bought 2; one for me and one for a gift.  This is one of my best eyelash curlers.  fast delivery. Great customer service! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I only bought this product because it was on sale. Not sure if it is worth $30 but it is definitely worth $15 in my eyes. They curled my lashes excellently, and I have stubborn, Asian-straight lashes. The closure latch that held together the curler snapped right off within the first day though, and I can&#x27;t use it anymore. Not a huge deal, but I wish I can still keep my curler together for when I travel.</li>
    <li> Love this since it works on my asian straight lashes, really curls them!</li>
    <li> Works well, but one of the handles cracked and broke off. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy again. Lot of money for a not so great product.</li>
    <li> The curler itself is wonderful, perfect shape and curled every single lash. The pads on the other hand are horrible. They are good for one use before they split and tear. I went through all the replacement pads within 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> It curls perfect love it!!</li>
    <li> Great eyelash curler but I don&#x27;t think they extend your eyelashes enough to quote &amp;#34;Whip Lash&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> No issues with pinching or going through the lash guards. I love this eyelash curler, and would recommend.  Also fast shipment and great communication!</li>
    <li> Love this.. Works great. Curls my lashes with no pain. Easy to use does not and bit has a clip to keep it closed.</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would be really cool compared to my old one, but it&#x27;s just kind of the same.  Actually, it almost pinches my eyelid more than my usual one because it is rounded slightly different.</li>
    <li> This eye lash curler is great....it does not pintch like all the others.  Good job!</li>
    <li> The curler is easy to use with great results. I have short lashes that hace never curled well, but the results with this product are outstanding. The company is great to work with and I&#x27;d absolutely purchase additional products from them.</li>
    <li> First two times I ordered this eyelash curler I loved them!!  I ordered my friend and myself one and they are crooked so it doesn&#x27;t curl my eyelashes and hers won&#x27;t even close on one end</li>
    <li> This is the best eyelash curler I have ever owned. It&#x27;s extremely high quality, comfortable to use, and highly effective! The company&#x27;s customer support is unbeatable, and they start you with 10 replacement pads for the eyelash curler! (I usually go through those very quickly, but these are really high quality, and I&#x27;ve gone months without needing to replace the pad!)&lt;br /&gt;I seriously love this thing. It&#x27;s the best, easiest part of my beauty routine. Money well spent!</li>
    <li> Fantastic!!! Thank you. It&#x27;s so much better than the first one I had. It&#x27;s an excellent product so I&#x27;m glad I was able to give it a second chance.</li>
    <li> Below is my previous review. I received a free replacement curler after posting my review. So far, so good. I am very pleased with the customer service of Crave Naturals so I&#x27;ve improved my review. If the replacement curler holds up I would give it a 5 star!   This eyelash curler started out okay but I had escalating issues with it until one of the handles on it recently broke and now it&#x27;s useless. Initially, I found it annoying that the rubber bumper piece would fall out all the time in my makeup bag and I would have to fish for it. Then more recently the alignment was off between the top and bottom of the eye curler part which would cause a terrible kinked look with my lashes. Lastly, I opened my makeup bag two days ago and the finger loop on the top handle had broke off then eventually slipped off making it un-usable completely. I had high hopes for this but am very disappointed in the performance. My traditional Revlon lash curler lasted me years and I never had issues like this. Perhaps the lash curler I received was a lemon...</li>
    <li> These are awesome! I used them right away and the difference it made in my eyelashes was amazing. I like that it came with a bunch of extra pieces. I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re called but the squishy part. Well worth the money and I will definitely buy these again if I ever need a new one. I like the locking function because it helps them stay closed and take up less space. And of course the fact that they are pink is a winner in my book</li>
    <li> I have weird eye sockets that make it difficult to place a lash curler close enough to the roots of the lashes to make a difference, but this curler did the trick! I was skeptical that a lash curler could make such a difference, but this one really does. Excellent customer service as well. So happy I bought this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the eyelash curlers out there.  THe rubber piece wears out and I cant find the piece to replace it and end up just buying another.  Most don&#x27;t get close enough to curl, just crimp them in the middle or pull out my lashes.  BUT NOT THIS ONE!!!  It fits the curve of my eye perfectly, Ican even curl the short ones in the corners without pulling them out.  This is the best curler Ive ever had! I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but liked this one so much I had to recommend it!</li>
    <li> Beware of handles coming off while in use!  The bottom handle came off while I was using it - only have used it a several times - and it smacked the top part of my eyeball on the eyelid.  Very painful for the rest of the day and part of the next day.  Hard to believe this product has such a good rating.</li>
    <li> This brush rocks! If you have a child who dreads brushing their hair, this is the answer!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really help in curling my lashes. It just looks cute but it lacks functionality. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Waste of money, not a curler worth buying. Junk!</li>
    <li> My girls love the brush. No more crying and whinning when i am brushing their long and thick hair!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product. I read so many good reviews that I tried it. 1) I pinched my left eyelid and 2) my $3.00 curler gave me a better curl with longer lashes. I&#x27;m upset that I spent so much money on a product which didn&#x27;t do for me what it did for others according to their reviews. I went and bought my other $3.00 eyelash curler as I have been curling my lashes for 20 years so I know it wasn&#x27;t operator error.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my daughter.  She is extremely pleased with it.  As it does not stick to her eyelashes, which seems to be a problem with most of the eyelash curlers that I have purchased. She&#x27; happy, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is the best one I&#x27;ve found and I have tried many. It curls my lashes quickly and evenly and doesn&#x27;t bend them at sharp angles. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Nice packaging. Easy to use, with great results!!</li>
    <li> This is a great curler!  I love the fact that it came with the refills. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Works great!  This was my 1st time using an eyelash curler, and it was easy to use and painless!</li>
    <li> I absolutely satisfied with this product.  It helps me brush my hair wih out pain. So glad I bought it. And it&#x27;s easy to clean, and I like it nor than &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this eyelash curler! I don&#x27;t know what it is about it, but it works absolutely fantastic!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love! Been using everyday! Worth the price!</li>
    <li> Does what it claims.  Super Customer Service!  I had a Shu Uemura eyelash curler in the past and needed a new one but unfortunately, they are no longer available in the US.  I bought the Whiplash Pink Eyelash Curler in hopes it would be comparable.  It is!  Thank you for the quick delivery!</li>
    <li> This is worth the money. I curler my lashes and then put on my mascara and my lashes stayed curled all day! Usually my lashes loose the curl right after I put on mascara. Love this curler!</li>
    <li> very disappointed in this curler; great reviews but didn&#x27;t curl at all. japonesque classic curler much better for curling eyelashes.</li>
    <li> This item broke within a couple weeks...it comes with many replacment pads thats the only thing i liked at it.</li>
    <li> Great product-I&#x27;m 55 years old, used dozens of eyelash curlers, this the the best hands down, and even better, their customer service is unsurpassed.  Can&#x27;t say enough about the product and the company-both awesome!</li>
    <li> WANTED TO LOVE IT .. BUT DIDN&#x27;T!&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to because I could hook it together easily for travel .. BUT it just plain did NOT curl as easily .. curl as fast .. curl last as long as my TRUSTY&lt;br /&gt;Shiseido Eyelash Curler which I have now gone back to!&lt;br /&gt;http://smile.amazon.com/Shiseido-Eyelash-Curler-Refill-Set/dp/B004RS7RRA/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1432433733&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;shiseido+eyelash+curler&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Shiseido is faster and lasts longer so thought I&#x27;d pass on the word.  The Crave is a cute pink and great marketing package .. but I&#x27;ll take substance over flash any day .. sorry.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Get a Lancôme eyelash curler for a few more $ it&#x27;s worth it. I lost a lot of lashes using this product with NO MASCARA!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it much but it seems to work well and curl all of my lashes</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I would buy this for a friend and for me again!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this!  It is so much easier on your hands to use, as well, as doing a very nice job of curling your eyelashes.  As with any eyelash curler, using a blow dryer quickly on the curler and eyelashes, really sets the curl.  It is just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I love this Whip lash eye curler so much more than any other lash curler that&#x27;s out there! It makes my lashes look fuller and gives my lashes a illusion of longer, thicker lashes when you have mascara or fake lashes on and gives a natural looking curl to naked lashes. I love it!!! Thank you</li>
    <li> I purchased the brush for my granddaughter who has long hair. It tangles easily so I thought the brush would help alleviate the tears. Yaaaa it works wonderfully. Thanks for making a brush that makes her life (and mine😉) a little easier.</li>
    <li> I really love this eyelash curler because it&#x27;s very easy to use &amp; I love the design. It also comes with 10 extra refill pads!  Works very well to give you longer looking lashes in seconds!</li>
    <li> Did not work out for me. The pads continuously fall out and will not stay in!</li>
    <li> Nice and easy set for my hairs . Great!!</li>
    <li> This Is the absolute worst curler I have ever bought! The curler cut my eye lashes in half! It was a waste of $15! Definitely sending it back for a refund. Do not waste your money on this terrible excuse of a eyelash curler!</li>
    <li> It is not easy for me to find a eyelash curler. My eyes are big but with depth on the side. So they tend to pinch, curl only half my lashes, or sometimes not at all. This one is the only affordable one I have found that does not pull, pinch, and actually grabs all my lashes with a perfect long and glamorous curl. Absolutely a girl girl must have tool in her vanity.</li>
    <li> I bought the Crave Naturals Pink Eyelash Curler. I admire this product because it comes in handy when on the go or traveling but it not something to be excited about. The rubber things that go inside slide out way to easy. I love that they are pink!</li>
    <li> I have had a hard time finding the right eyelash curler, but this one seems to do the job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also bought the detangling hair brush…that works FABULOUS!!</li>
    <li> Sooooo much easier on my hair and scalp than my old hairbrush. Makes my hair shinier, too.</li>
    <li> I like :)&lt;br /&gt;The handles are comfy&lt;br /&gt;It took a few goes at it, then lashes were curled.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very happy and my daughter loves it. Thanks</li>
    <li> fully satisfy with this item&lt;br /&gt;very useful</li>
    <li> My daughter has very long hair and this brush is amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so content with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;This eyelash curler does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to; curl my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I did not pinch myself like I usually do. All it takes is one pinch to make my eyelashes pop &amp; voila, beautiful curled eyelashes!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really great.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the packaging is really cute. Can&#x27;t go wrong with comic pop art!</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash curler, I&#x27;ve never been one to use them often, but I use this one everyday.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this now for 8 months and it broke this morning. The plastic handle snapped at the joint where it was poured, sealed, &amp; connected to the metal. It cracked in my hand and flew in my eye. Also, it plucked about 5 lashes on its way out. I loved this when it worked, but for its short lifespan I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much I really love this brush.  It really works and gets the tangles out quickly and easily!  It&#x27;s so much easier to use than a regular hair brush!</li>
    <li> Very good curler, love it :)</li>
    <li> Love the packaging but the good feelings stopped with the box. I found this eyelash curler to be very awkward to use. It seemed impossible to get all of my lashes in the device and when pressing, it pinched and hurt.</li>
    <li> Broke within a week. Ridiculous. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The rubber part of curler comes off too easily. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Just another eye lash Curler</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many eyelash curlers &amp; this one is worth every penny. I was a bit skeptical with the price at first but the product speaks for itself; I get a perfect curl every time.  I do have a slight problem with pinching my lid but readjusting my placement and curling towards the middle of my lashes seems to correct the problem.  This minor issue in no way affects my admiration for this product. Annoying, yes. But, would it affect my decision to purchase this again? No.  Also, the sellers speedy service made this transaction THAT much better, I ordered it on Wednesday &amp; received it on Friday! Yes, I have Amazon&#x27;s Prime 2-day shipping but there have been many occasions where the seller fell short of that arrangement and this seller did not. The description also said that it would only come with 2 extra pads and mine came with 5 additional pads! Not to mention, that the seller contacted me and notified me that if I ever need additional replacements, just call them and they would send me some for free!  Great seller and great product.  Crave Naturals has definitely earned my business and I look forward to purchasing more of these as gifts because every girl should have one!  Best eyelash curler EVER!</li>
    <li> Crumbled in my hands, literally.</li>
    <li> I used the Whiplash every day for about a week, and my results were consistent. I didn’t notice a huge change in the curl of my lashes, but I did notice that the Whiplash helped to spread out my lashes and give them a fuller look. As you can see in the photo above, the curled lash has more of a falsies effect, while the uncurled lash appears thinner and more scattered. I’m definitely pleased with the results! I don’t need a lot of extra curl, but I do like the polished look I get when I use the curler. I wouldn’t reach for it on a daily basis, but when I want a bit more va-va-voom it is the perfect choice. Plus, I think it is great for those of you who don’t have naturally curled eyelashes! I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is a great set, comes with extra rubber pieces. The crimp-er is strong, handles all kinds of lashes well, fits comfortable in your fingers. Cleans well, just a simple wipe down, and some rubbing alcohol around the crimp-er. I love how it locks up, so it won&#x27;t break or wear down in time, in your makeup bag.</li>
    <li> I really really really wanted to like this. I wanted a super awesome eyelash curler. But this one is just average. I&#x27;d almost say below average. It initially curls lashes very well. They looked great. But only for five minutes. I curled them and came back about ten minutes later to apply mascara and they were completely flat again. I&#x27;m just not as impressed as a lot of the other reviewers for this product. I gave it two stars because it does curl the lashes at first and it is very comfortable to use. It just doesn&#x27;t last. :(</li>
    <li> I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS. Everything from the packaging to the color of the handle. Not only that but it curls perfectly. Worth it.</li>
    <li> I love the branding. Period. I think this probably appeals to most girls. So fun and such a great gift. I would never normally give an eyelash curler as a gift, but how fun is this? Love the hot pink. I also love that this clips closed. Next, this thing comes with endless refills! Other curlers I’ve bought in the past have one refill, if any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of how this works, it’s significantly better than most other curlers I’ve tried. This curler is better than the Revlon, Mirenesse, Sephora, and Kevin Aucoin ones I’ve tried. I’ve also heated my eyelash curlers with a blowdryer for added effectiveness and they don’t work as well as this one. This is super easy to use, has never caught my eye, and is just a great eyelash curler. It gives a nice curl that looks just right (so it doesn’t leave my lashes spindly or straight up like some curlers can do). I keep this one in my purse for the most part for quick fixes. One curl with this and I’m good for the night.</li>
    <li> I had pretty much quit using eyelash curlers because I couldn&#x27;t find one that fit my eye. I had never had this problem before I decided it was time to update all my make up tools a few years ago. I discarded my eyelash curler of some 15 years before purchasing a new one and what a mistake that turned out to be. The curler I bought to replace it (don&#x27;t remember what my original brand had been) was too big for my eye socket. I would have to angle it to curl the inner lashes then angle the other way to curl the outer lashes which pretty much left the center lashes uncurled. I never thought I had an unusually small eye socket but apparently I do. I tried a couple of others from various stores but could not find one that worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The older I get the more straight my eyelashes seem to grow and I decided to try again to find a curler that would work for me. After researching the reviews I decided on this one and another brand and they both worked. This curler is really cute with the pink handles and measures approximately 1 3/8 inch wide with the curve being approximately 3/8 inch deep. The store brands that didn&#x27;t work for me measured 1 1/2 inches wide and 1/2 deep. You wouldn&#x27;t think that 1/8 inch difference in size would matter but for me it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curler does a nice job of curling my lashes, getting them all in at the same time. I curl close to the lid then again about half way out and this gives me a pleasing curl. This curler advertises that it comes with 5 extra refills but mine came with 10 extra refills. I don&#x27;t know if this was an error in the ad or in the bagging but it is a generous amount if they don&#x27;t wear out too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had occasion to contact their customer service and they get 5 stars too!</li>
    <li> It came quickly, and my wife says it leaves her eyelashes nice and curled (better than other brands) it also came with multiple replacement cushions!</li>
    <li> I went on Amazon, looking for a replacement to my Shu Uemura eyelash curler; just to find out that they no longer offer it in the US (and there are accusations that the ones sold here are counterfeit).  The Whiplash curler popped up at the top of my search and the other reviews were awesome - they were right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I am 1/2 Chinese and my eyelashes are short, straight and stubborn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Picks up all lashes on the 1st attempt&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t pinch skin or pull out lashes&lt;br /&gt;- Curls really nicely&lt;br /&gt;- My lashes keep the curl/crimp even without mascara&lt;br /&gt;- They send you the curler, pad and TEN replacement pads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The silicone pad slips out really easily (it was slipping out before I even used it BUT it didn&#x27;t end up slipping when I curled)</li>
    <li> You are going to love using this really easy eye curler but for me the reason it was perfect was because of the plastic handles that did not hurt my hands. I am so glad that more and more products are being made that keep RA and Fibromyalgia women in mind when they design these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have RA and Fibromyalgia so things are really starting to affect me since my RA medications no longer work and my poor fingers swell a lot now and I am pain on some days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Closure Hatch is another favorite part that I thought was pretty awesome. I like this because it keeps the curler from getting damaged in my makeup bag or drawer and if you travel a lot, this is important because it would be a bummer to open that luggage and find this broken at the worst possible time!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Great for us beauty gurus. Curls to perfection❤️</li>
    <li> it was time to replace my old maybelline eyelash curler. this thing is definitely a step up. i didnt realize how much i was actually pinching my eyelids with my crappy old curler, until i tried this for the first time. it&#x27;s so comfortable to use!!! it doesn&#x27;t tear eyelashes out, you can barely feel it when youre using it. definitely a great design. love that it&#x27;s pink, love that it comes with replacement pads. i&#x27;m so glad i upgraded, id recommend one of these to all my girlfriends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so its been a couple of months since i got this curler. the curler itself works just fine still, but i;m disappointed to report that the pads they come with tend to get damaged very quickly by the pressure the locking mechanism puts on the rubber pad itself. i already had one pad split in half on me, and i tried to use it anyway and it was a biggole mess. i wish this product came with MORE extra replacement pads, as i will probably go through the other two pretty fast since they get damaged like that and are unusable. if i can find more replacement pads for not too expensive, i will be happy, otherwise ill be disappointed that ill need to replace my curler again once i run out of these pads. bummer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: so today i went to check the mail, and Crave Naturals has sent me some replacement pads for my curler for free. this makes me really really happy. Thank you, youre a good company. :) completely redeemed!!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice and cute lashes</li>
    <li> These are ok. Was expecting something a little more sturdy - almost think they will break at times. But they are ok.</li>
    <li> This pinched my eyelids worse than any other curler I have ever used no matter how I used it...don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic eyelash curler, i love all of the extra rubber grippers that come with it. I was very pleased with this eyelash curler it didn&#x27;t pull or hurt to use. I highly recommend this eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> This actually works! My lashes have a mind of their own... They go this way and that... Curling them with the crave really makes them not look so messy!  I love this crave curler</li>
    <li> I liked this item until one day it spontaneously broke. The tension from the clip cracked the thumb grip. It still works but I have little room to grip the handle now.</li>
    <li> I bought a detangling brush for my six year old granddaughter. She loved it but so did her mother who was always &amp;#34;borrowing&amp;#34; the brush. Finally, I bought her mother a second brush and both are happy.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is great!  I guess most curlers work about the same, but I must have a small eye socket because many I have tried cant/don&#x27;t fit in close enough to grab my little lashes.  This curler gets right on in there so it can do its job!</li>
    <li> This is a great eyelash curler and definitely the best one I have ever owned. It doesn hurt or pinch and it curls them perfect and remains curled all day. Love it and will never buy another brand again.</li>
    <li> Even though the product is described to have a life-time warranty, it does not appear anywhere on the packaging or the little instruction page inside. Also, it pinches the corner of eye sometimes, so I have to be really careful when I curl it. With that said, the result is pretty good and long lasting, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I can achieve this with a similar (and cheaper) item. Also, the rubber pad on the curler is black, not pink. I was a bit disappointed about that, I wanted everything to match. Not sure if I&#x27;d recommend this product to my friends. I guess they can always try my first.</li>
    <li> The worst!! Metal closing latch broke the first week. It seems like a &amp;#34;win&amp;#34; receiving all the refills, but they have to be replaced so often because they don&#x27;t last, they split in the middle, causing the metal curler to go farther down and RIP OUT / CUT your lashes.  And the refills don&#x27;t fit. Constantly had to adjust the pads before using, they&#x27;re too small. So irritating. When I thought it couldn&#x27;t get worse, one of the pink handles split in half and fell off. What a waste of money and effort. I wish I had returned it instead of hoping it&#x27;d get better with next refill pad. Nope! The handle splitting was the last straw. I usually don&#x27;t leave bad reviews, but this is absolute garbage. Your lashes deserve better and there&#x27;s better out there.</li>
    <li> First and most importantly, my lashes stayed curled all day!! Not only all day, but, I noticed that when I was washing my make off at night, my lashes were still curled!!! Another major feature is the advanced top bar design that fits all eye shapes and sizes, with absolutely no lashes left behind!! I haven’t lost a single lash!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next up is the design. The Whiplash Eye Curler is 100% Pinch Free! The Whiplash has an ergonomic handle and my favorite feature is the closure latch! The Whiplash stays closed inside my makeup bag!! SWEET!!!</li>
    <li> These do a fine job curling my lashes. I had hoped for a more even distribution of curl. I end up still needing to squeeze down on each side 4-5 times each to get an even curl, and sometimes I miss the corner lashes. The main reason I&#x27;m giving this a 4 star rating is because the plastic piece that holds the lock in place broke within a couple of months, and now the latch sometimes gets stuck on the end of the handle *while I&#x27;ve got my eyelashes in the clamp*. Not ideal.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a gift for my youngest niece. She is ten-years-old, has course, curly, very long hair which she considers to be the &amp;#34;ugliest hair ever!&amp;#34; Well, she whips this brush out at every opportunity. Her teacher has banned it from her classroom, and her mother has banned it from her purse on Sunday mornings. We have decided she now brushes her hair for the attention it brings. Everyone mentions her &amp;#34;beautiful curls.&amp;#34; Charlotte says... this brush &amp;#34;saved my life!&amp;#34; If this isn&#x27;t a five star rating, I don&#x27;t know what is.</li>
    <li> It is not good for asian eyes. It doesn&#x27;t work well for me. (02/2015)  Updated information (09/07): The company found out my review. They immediately  contacted me and sent  new product to me for free. It works very well. I love it. Thank you for great customer service. Thank you for taking care of customer needs.</li>
    <li> Really nice quality eyelash curler. This item works so much better than any other curler I&#x27;ve used (mostly drugstore.. Revlon, etc). The customer service is great. Very cute packaging.</li>
    <li> AWFUL eyelash curler! I have never had a problem with an eyelash curler before, particularly with it CUTTING my eyelashes. Each apd I tried ended up becoming cut down the middle after about 2 uses, resulting in your lashes getting stuck in the ridge and cutting off. Don&#x27;t waste your money and the length of your lashes on this product.</li>
    <li> Oh first I have to say the packaging is cool!! Its what you would see at a high end beauty store. Very eye catching, the picture that shows for this product does no justice. Ok so on with my thoughts, Its made very nicely and very easy to use. It came with extra pads so you are well stocked up for a while. This did great for my lashes. I dont have the longest lashes in the world but they do look fuller and longer after I use this. This is a product that you must have for your beauty collection/bag. Did I mention the packaging is amazing?</li>
    <li> Superior to my old Revlon curler.  My bf even commented on my lashes before I headed out last weeknd.  Seems to do the job and I am very pleased with my purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to add that this doesnt bend or crimp my lashes like the cheaper one did.  It actually curls them which looks more natural.&lt;br /&gt;I am still loving it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my old eyelash curler for years now and just haven&#x27;t got around to buying a new one. I wanted something that would actually make a difference. I have STRAIGHT lashes...no curl what so ever! I&#x27;ve finally found something that makes my lashes look awesome! Thanks Whiplash!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I would recommend this product to others.  My daughters had been suffering from tangles, and this brush made a big difference</li>
    <li> The company was kind enough to send me a replacement which I really appreciate. However, one of the plastic pieces has broken again already. It still works though and curls great - better than the Maybelline one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the plastic handles broke within a month of receiving it and I&#x27;m left with only the metal piece which is very difficult to handle. It was good while it lasted, but not worth the money. My trusty M.... has lasted for years, but thought I&#x27;d try something new. Mistake.</li>
    <li> I tried it a few times and it works OK. It&#x27;s not 1 of the best ones but pair it with a great mascara and you will be rockin.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best eye lash curler I&#x27;ve ever used. I sale makeup products and I will be recommending this product to all of my customers</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product . Does not curl good. Made a few eye lashes fall off.</li>
    <li> This is actually the first eyelash curler I have ever used and I love it.  It curled nicely and having the extra refills came in handy.  Only downside I have found is that you do need the extra pads as these ones do seem to go bad quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curler itself is easy to grip and has a locking mechanism which makes it less likely to get damaged in my kit.  I have fairly long lashes, and this grips well without pinching and I rather enjoy it.  Not bad for a first time lash curler user!  I have recommended the Whiplash curler to a few friends and at least 2 have purchased it and said it was really good as well!</li>
    <li> I bought this years ago and loved it.  It finally broke and I just bought a new one.  I have gone through 4 of the pads already because they are so flimsy that they keep tearing and then it rips my eyelashes out.  Loved the old one, but the new pads do nothing but rip out eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Arrived right on time. Package is good, tight, with ease of opening. Fits my eyelashes just right. Follow up letter from manufacturer with lots of helpful tips on use. Very pleased with this product. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through a few of these and this is by far the best one.  The pink is a cute color too! :D</li>
    <li> I found the product easy to use and with no pain.  They give you refill pads, so it should last for a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is light which makes it easy.  Great results !</li>
    <li> Shrug. I don&#x27;t know what all the fuss is about. It seems exactly the same as a $2.99 drug store eyelash curler to me.</li>
    <li> I USED THIS WITH * ITS SO BIG* MASCARA- SOLD ON AMAZON.  LOVED THE MASCARA AND WANTED A REALLY GOOD EYELASH CURLER TO GO WITH IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WELL- THESE TWO PRODUCTS WERE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I WILL SAY I DID DO SOMETHING THAT THE *WHIPLASH MANUFACTURER* DOES NOT SUGGEST YOU DO:  I  PUT MY MASCARA ON AND THEN CURLED MY LASHES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DID NOT GET ANY PULLING ON MY LASHES OR PINCHED EYELIDS.  THE MANUFACTURER SUGGESTS CURLING BARE LASHES THEN APPLYING THE MASCARA OF YOUR CHOICE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SORRY- I GAVE IT  A TRY AND IT JUST DOES NOT WORK FOR ME.  IT MIGHT WORK FOR SOMEONE ELSE, SO TRY IT FIRST AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I PUT ON MY MASCARA- THEN USED THIS CURLER AND JUST HELD IT IN PLACE FOR AS LONG AS I WAS ABLE TO.&lt;br /&gt;NO NEED TO SQUEEZE IT LIKE A VICE......WITH THE CURLER APPLIED LONG ENOUGH( YOU WILL GET THE HANG OF HOW LONG ) YOU END UP WITH BEAUTIFUL, NATURAL , LONG AND DEFINED LASHES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ALSO ADDED MORE MASCARA LATER AFTER THE CURLED SHAPE WAS SET.....YOU NEED TO PLAY AROUND WITH IT TO SEE HOW IT WORKS BEST FOR YOU.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMEND THIS CURLER AS THE BEST I HAVE FOUND SO FAR.  AND SINCE IT WORKS GREAT WITH THE MASCARA I MENTIONED ABOVE, I HAVE TO SAY THEY MAKE A GREAT SET TO PURCHASE ON AMAZON!</li>
    <li> Now, here&#x27;s what the exceptionally excellent customer service stands for. After I posted my review below with problem of the curler pads, the seller has sent me a pack of replacement pads which worked much better! Apparently, some boxes have wrong size pads in them. The new pads are slightly thicker, and won&#x27;t be easily cut into at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Based on the almost excellent reviews, I went ahead and bought this curler. Well, I can not say it&#x27;s bad. It looks to be well constructed, and it does not pinch, lovely color. However, the replacement pads are horrible. Now I can understand why it comes with 10 of them. If you are heavy handed with other curlers, try to change your habit on this one. The pads are so fragile, they are easily cut into a big split with just one squeeze. Check your pad after each use, if it&#x27;s cut, change it right away, otherwise next time you use it you&#x27;ll end up pulling your lashes out. Another thing, 50% of the replacement pads do not sit into the curler right, either one end always lifted up or the other. I went back to use my Revlon curler, you can squeeze as hard as you can, the pad held up just like new. If you think maybe by squeezing gently the problem will go away, well, then your lashes are not curled right, or just slightly curled and will fall straight once you put mascara on. I started to search other replacement pads online, maybe I can find something better.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Besides the pass constantly falling out this a great eyelash curler! I love it! Other curlers wouldn&#x27;t keep my eyelashes curled all day and this one does. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a great item! It is way above any curler you get at any other retail store! No pinching my eyelids! No pulling out my lashes! The foam filler is firm but soft, so you get a great lasting curl! I am so glad I found this product on Amazon!</li>
    <li> The first two days of use I absolutely loved this! The third day though the pink pad has popped out of the corner on the curler and so far I can not get it to stay in. I can still use it, and it&#x27;s curling fine, actually curls the best of any one I&#x27;ve ever used. However, not being to get the pad to stay put is disheartening, and it makes me wonder if the pads will come completely out as others complain of, or if the next refillable one will stay put. I hope it does not continue coming loose, because I do love the curl it gives. One thing I really am happy about is the bright pink pad. If it does fall out I will notice it&#x27;s missing, I had one of the plain chrome ones that the pad had fallen off of and I didn&#x27;t noticed it till I pretty much cut most of my eyelashes off (this was many, many years ago) but you don&#x27;t want that to ever happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am editing (finally learned how to find my reviews) and upgraded this to a 5 star. This is the best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;m no spring chicken! Initially, my pad fell out as I noted in my original review. The company promptly sent me the correct size pads out (evidently some were sent out with the wrong size) after reading my review, and now I could not be happier. This has never pinched my eye,and wow do you EVER get fabulous looking eyelashes that last all day! I really mean mine look like false lashes they curl so well. It is amazing how much younger your eyes look when your lashes curl correctly. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this curler, it&#x27;s truly awesome. For those not liking it, maybe they aren&#x27;t using it correctly. I read once to start at the base of your lashes, crimp and move up once, crimp, and once more, crimp, and with this curler if you do that, your eyelashes will look amazing! Plus I really love when a company cares enough about their consumer to actually read our reviews, and immediately take care of the problem. Can&#x27;t ask for any better customer service. It&#x27;s very well made so I anticipate this being with me for many years to come!</li>
    <li> Product quality is good and it seems like the company has great customer service. Not sure what all the other reviews are raving about; it seems like an ordinary eyelash curler. One thing I don&#x27;t like is that it always pinches my eyelids, but perhaps it&#x27;s just a matter of getting better at using the curler.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this curler for over a month now and I&#x27;m very impressed by how well it works. This is my first time taking a chance on a curler that was more than a couple bucks, and I&#x27;m glad I did. I can definitely tell the difference from my old cheap one that was lingering in my bathroom (yet was hardly used because well...it sucked). I also love that it came with a lot of extra pads. Definitely would recommend! Plus the packaging and product design is super cute :)</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Just ordered another one as a gift. Great customer service!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because the ratings were so good but I really don&#x27;t understand why. It pinches and hurts when I use it and doesn&#x27;t curl my lashes very well at all. I will be finding out how to get my money back</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! My daughter loves it very much!</li>
    <li> my lashes kept getting stuck to the pad and as a result the pad kept popping out of the tool....returning it today&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I just got a bad one.......but the seller could not have been more proactive and responsive. Even to the point of sending me a new curler&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they were great!</li>
    <li> The pads will not stay in the curler.  Either one end or the other sticks up, the pad does not sit snugly at all, and by the time I get my lashes into the curler, the pad has fallen out.  I tried four of the pads, all with the same result.</li>
    <li> Customer service here is stellar. STELLAR. I rarely encounter companies that put this much effort into customer service or, really, this much effort and pride into their products. Don&#x27;t need anything else from company, but feel compelled simply to support them. They deserve to be rewarded for such good work.</li>
    <li> Great customer service and brush works well also! Would buy from again. It detangles as well as a comb. The shape looks cool too.</li>
    <li> The eyelash curler is okay. The but extra lads they provided where nit compadiable with the curler. The pads do not fit and they fall out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see what the huge fuss is about, this product is okay-good.  Not the world&#x27;s best eyelash curler.  A tad pricey, but I guess those 3 replacements kind of work it out.  But still, Duane Reade sells a 2.00 version of this (diff brand) and it works literally the same way.  I&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
    <li> I was given this product to give my honest opinion of the product. I love it!!!!! my eyelashes don&#x27;t pull off and you get plenty of rubbers for your eyelash curler. I wish they would have had this curler when I was young I can not tell you how many  times I have lost my eyelashes to a bad curler. I love whiplash love it love it</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time. However, I could not test it as it was missing the cushion pad as well as the refill cushion pads. It was very inconvenient as I was really looking forward to trying it out! I will have to return it and order something else. If you order this product, do NOT order it from the seller &amp;#34; Crave Naturals&amp;#34; since you might receive the product with missing accessories.</li>
    <li> Awesome tools for everyday uses--it&#x27;s the best curler I&#x27;ve had so far. They also give you extras for refills. Thank you, Crave Naturals!</li>
    <li> Im absolutely in love with the whiplash curler, works fantastic compared to other curlers. Not only does it work great but the customer service seems very nice and accommodating. The only issue I had was I didn&#x27;t receive the 10 replaceable curling pads like it says it should I didn&#x27;t even get 1 otherwise I would of rated this 5 stars. Overall it&#x27;s worth buying, you won&#x27;t find a curler like this one!</li>
    <li> The plastic part of the handle broke after 3 months of use, making this product hard to use, since the metal under the plastic loop is straight!.  For the price, it should not have plastic, easily breakable parts!</li>
    <li> Curled all of my lashes at once and made them look stunning. Highly&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
    <li> This curler is perfect! My lashes are naturally long, but they are very flat and usually when i curl them, the curl does not last. My curl lasted into the next day, and all i did was hold down for ten seconds close to the roots, then pump all the way to the ends. The design is great and the fact that you can hook the latch on so that the curler stays closed is very practical storage-wise. Came with plenty of replacement pads and package arrived on time and in great shape. Overall, super satisfied and never going back to drugstore curlers!</li>
    <li> I ordered this curler but every time I clamp down the pad becomes dislodged. Tried the other refill pads that came with it and the same result :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had short hair so I&#x27;ve rarely needed to worry about tangles.  Now that I am letting it grow out longer, I&#x27;m shocked at how many tangles I have and how difficult it is to brush my hair.  I tried conditioners and different kinds of brushes.  I looked up &amp;#34;getting tangles of hair&amp;#34; on Pinterest, I saw there was something called a &amp;#34;detangling brush.&amp;#34;  Well, I found your product on Amazon and LOVE it.  While I love having longer hair now, I was at the point of getting it cut because the tangles were so bad.  Thank you for coming to the rescue!</li>
    <li> I tried this eye lash curler and I was not fond of it at first, but the replacement worked much better. At first, I had issues with it pinching my eyelids and ripping out lashes, so the company immediately sent me a new one,they felt the one I had was defective. I must say, the new one was MUCH better. It is a decent eye lash curler. :)</li>
    <li> This is the nicest eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever owned! I absolutely love it! And, it came with several replacement pads which is a plus. It works wonderfully and smooth and i love the fact that you can close it with a latch so it doesn&#x27;t get messed up in a drawer or purse. The curl really does last all day!</li>
    <li> A little bulky, but works good.</li>
    <li> Ordered on February 1st -- received February 3rd, only without the 5 extra pads as stated in the ad. When the package arrived the cool, comic-looking box stated it had 3 extra pads...the box only had the curler - no pads to speak of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So now, I&#x27;m confused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed Crave and got a pretty lightening fast reply.  I was told the boxes are packed by hand and that they would be sending me not 3 or 5 pads, but 10! Pretty sweet! Five days goes buy without anything. Honestly, I figured the curler got to me so fast, that the pads should be right behind! I emailed On February 10th, I asked for status on the pads and the response from them asked me how may pads did I have (thought we discussed this, I had zero)...I was also told the pads were going out the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On February 12th (two days later), I was told the pads were sent out the day before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;February 19th rolls around and I still have no pads. I emailed Crave again to ask for status. It as at this point I was told the pads were coming from Canada. I received them in the mail on 02/21.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying to curl my eyelashes with not much success. I&#x27;ll chalk that up to no experience and a pad I&#x27;ve been using for three weeks. I do give Crave credit tho - it&#x27;s very ergonomic. Very nice feel on your hand while curling your lashes.</li>
    <li> I love this Whip Lash lash curler! First, because they are PINK!!  The packaging is amazing!  The curler itself is very easy to use. It comes with 10 pad refills so once the bottom pad becomes &amp;#34;too used&#x27;.. dirty or what have you. just pop it out and replace it with a fresh one. The curler is very easy to use. a couple of &amp;#34;pumps&amp;#34; curls your lashes.. add mascara and BOOM! Beautiful! The delivery was very fast. Crave Naturals shipped these very quickly. They even followed up a couple of times to be sure I was satisified with my purchase. YES, I am. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I had originally rated this a 3 due to issues with my lashes sticking to the curler.  The manufacturer reached out to me about the problems I was experiencing concerned about what happened and volunteered to make it right by sending me a new curler to try.  I must admit the new curler works great.  My lashes do not stick and I get a great curl.  I want to commend this manufacturer for their concerns with their product and doing what is needed to take care of the customers.</li>
    <li> I was sceptical at first.  I have very stubborn eyelashes and thought it possibly won&#x27;t work but, WOW very impressed. It curls your eyelashes very well.  Customer Service is AWESOME!!!!! I would recommend this best eyelash curler ever.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this curler. As I mentioned in my earlier review, they have EXCELLENT customer service. Maybe the curler is great but there&#x27;s no way for me to know because the pads are AWFUL. They last less than a week before they&#x27;re punctured by the top part of the curler which clamps down. This causes my lashes to get pinched into the pad and, when I pull the curler away, my lashes go along with it. And yes, of course I&#x27;ve unclamped the curler before I pull it away.  I bet if they would just make the pads stiffer and stronger, This alone would drastically improve the overall product.   ----------------------------  I had a problem with the original product I was sent and Crave Naturals was all over it. They made sure I received a quality product. So far, so good. I will say I noticed a quality different between the dark pink and light pink cushions. One of them is a lot more sturdy than the other. By \\&quot;sturdy\\&quot; or lack thereof, I mean the eyelash curler cut through the cushion after just a couple of uses. But the stronger one is holding up after a week - so far, so good!</li>
    <li> At first, I hated this curler and I couldn&#x27;t understand all the great reviews for it. I&#x27;m not a novice when it comes to using an eyelash curler either. First, it was pinching my eyelid no matter what I tried and after trying to curl lashes on each eye, the lashes fell almost immediately and my mascara didn&#x27;t help keep the lashes up. I didn&#x27;t want to give up on it even with lackluster results after the first few uses. So I was looking at it and noticed that the cushion pad didn&#x27;t even fit properly and it bulged out of the curler when I used it. I decided to take the pad out and insert one of the extra pads that came with the curler and voila! Finally, it worked properly. No more pinching, no more &amp;#34;falling&amp;#34; lashes either. If you get this and don&#x27;t have good results, try replacing the cushion pad.</li>
    <li> Wow i like really thats wonderfull i Will be buy again</li>
    <li> Great eyelash curler. And wonderful company to work with. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The pads won&#x27;t stay put and made  a few eye lashes fall off.</li>
    <li> same as every other curler</li>
    <li> Awesome brush! This brush makes your scalp feel amazing! It came in very nice packaging with a coupon for a future purchase. Very happy with quality and cute pink color.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase!  Quick shipping and a great product!</li>
    <li> This curler not only ripped out lashes; it also pinched my skin above the cheekbone when attempting to curl my lashes. Be careful.</li>
    <li> I love the pink color of this eye lash curler and it works really well. Definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> My 5 year old granddaughter has very thick long hair.  Always seems to be tangled.  Took only a couple minutes&lt;br /&gt;to brush out the tangles!!  And the best part is she said it didn&#x27;t hurt at all!  I would totally recommend this brush!&lt;br /&gt;It really works....I bought two so I can keep one at my hourse when she sleeps over!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know how much I was missing out with my cheap revlon one! This is night and day difference!</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash curler.  I have bought several different than this one, and I am throwing them away.  It does not pinch, and it is much easier to use and see, if you are curling the lashes.  It is pricey, but they give you replacement pads, and and it seems as if the company very much wants your satisfaction.  Love it, and the company, would buy other products from them!  You will not regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> It does curl your your eyelashes, however, it is not the best. I order it because is pink &amp; I liked the box.</li>
    <li> It made a big difference and no pinching. It locks closed so less breakage i&#x27;m sure.  I like that it came with so many extra cushions</li>
    <li> First Impressions...&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t curly my lashes very frequently, but when I was given the opportunity to review this eye lash curler I decided to brave up and try something new. I&#x27;m always a little terrified that the curler is going to cut off my lashes, so I&#x27;m pretty picky and thorough when I look into a new eyelash curler. I gave this eyelash curler by Crave Naturals a good inspection and while it doesn&#x27;t look &#x27;high quality&#x27;, it does looks promising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging...&lt;br /&gt;I really liked how the box was designed! As you can see from the pictures in this post, it had a &#x27;comic book&#x27; theme to it and seemed like a very well made and sturdy box. Inside the curler was supported very securely and had a little booklet and a packet of extra eyelash curler pads. Which I thought was wonderful -- they give you enough replacement pads to last you a good long while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the curler was fair. It wasn&#x27;t outstanding, in my opinion -- the pink handles were plastic and the connecting strip the holds the curler closed was made of very thin, almost bendable wire. Just looking at it reminded me of the way the ELF eyelash curler is made. And when I handled it and actually used it, they did seem very similar. So, something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product &amp; Ease of Use...&lt;br /&gt;Using the Whiplash Eyelash Curler was typical of any other eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever seen -- you get your lashes between the pad and as close to your lid as possible, then give it a good squeeze for a few seconds. It worked well and curled my lashes just fine. Once mascara was on, I never noticed the curl falling throughout the day. But then again, I don&#x27;t have hard-to-curl lashes. So for me, this worked well and did the job just fine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Major Likes &amp; Dislikes...&lt;br /&gt;Hmm, there isn&#x27;t really anything about this product that really stood out to me as a &#x27;major like&#x27;. It was good, did the job well, but I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference between this eyelash curler and my ELF one. And the price difference between the two is pretty significant -- ELF&#x27;s is a $1 and Crave Natural&#x27;s Whiplash is $14.88, on sale. So, pretty expensive, in my opinion! And, if you&#x27;re looking at the quality between the two lash curlers, I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re both the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Thoughts...&lt;br /&gt;The Crave Natural&#x27;s Whiplash Eyelash Curler get&#x27;s the job done. The design and materials used to make this product isn&#x27;t anything outstanding or heavy duty. With the high price tag attached to this curler, I don&#x27;t think I would repurchase this product. If you like the look of the box -- and the fact that this curler is pink -- than maybe this would be worth the price. So it really depends on what your preference is. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.the price difference between the two is pretty significant -- ELF&#x27;s is a $1 and Crave Natural&#x27;s Whiplash is $14.88, on sale.

    <li> The pads keep falling out!  Maybe I got a faulty curler, but it came with extra pads and I&#x27;ve not been able to get them to stay in. Worst of all, it pulled some of my eyelashes out! I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
    <li> Worked wonderful but broke after 2 months. They sent a new curler without my asking. Is working great.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyelash curler and so well made! Feels great in the hand and gives a great curl!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with a product than this one!</li>
    <li> Love this.  My daughter no longer is in agony over brushing her hair!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent curler, which is like the older spongie tipped curlers from years ago, which I liked the best. This is it !</li>
    <li> this is a geat eyelash  curler</li>
    <li> I ordered this a few months ago and when it arrived, the extra pads were not included.  I emailed the company and got an immediate email response with an apology and a promise to send me the pads right away.  I got them and boy, do I appreciate their attention and surprise customer service!  The curler itself is great!  Doesn&#x27;t pinch my eyelid and the curl seems to last longer.  Will order a few more for back up and to give to my granddaughter, my fashionista consultant!</li>
    <li> I am a long hair, It is difficult to comb through the hair after wash, i had bought a similar comb, i feel good and bought it again this time , it&#x27;s nice to me. thank you!</li>
    <li> Loved the whiplash curler.  This curler curls my lashes without pinching by eyelid and without having to hold down so hard like other eyelash curlers.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Love this curler!! So easy to use and completely painless!! Throw your old one away and buy this one - you won&#x27;t be sorry!!!</li>
    <li> The packaging was cut on this. It came with a little card and a discount code for future purchases from this seller. I also got a giant bag of extra pads for the curler. The curler was sturdy but a bit stiff. We will see how it goes after a few uses.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is sweet! It looks so girlie and cute with pink handles and cushions. It is made of very good quality and it curls BEAUTIFULLY without hurting my eyelids!! I heat it up with my blow dryer for a few seconds and it makes it an eyelash curling iron! :)  I had to take a few minutes and leave a review because I like it so much. Worth every penny &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> I bought this hairbrush for my 8 year old daughter, Brianna. I also bought her the book&amp;#34;the girl who wouldn&#x27;t brush her hair&amp;#34;.  Brianna loves the brush.  She has actually brushed twice without even being coerced.  She has long hair and always complained that it hurt.  Every time I go to visit her, I want to brush it and she fights me.  Not anymore.  This is an amazing tool.  May get one for myself.</li>
    <li> Hello. My first order eyelash curler.&lt;br /&gt;It is Good  choice.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy curl.&lt;br /&gt;Refil is many goods&lt;br /&gt;Thank you .have a nice day good shopping</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this curler bc I have stubborn Asian eyelashes that are shorter and notoriously resistant to curling. Also, I have a hooded/monolid so that sometimes flattens out any curl I put in.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Whiplash curler for a few days now and yes there&#x27;s a difference! The spring mechanism requires you to squeeze w a bit more pressure than a standard curler, so the curls really last. Also, you get a real curl, not just a crimp. It feels sturdy and durable. Well worth the money spent.&lt;br /&gt;Mine came with 10 refill pads (not just 5 like it said in the description). And I received a coupon code for 25% off my next Crave Naturals order. Nice surprise!&lt;br /&gt;Will def be recommending this to all my friends looking for a new eyelash curler!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews however, I can&#x27;t really tell how, but seriously, my five year old daughter, with the finest, craziest bed head in the morning, brushes every tangle out of her hair when she wakes up! Unreal! She says, &amp;#34;Mommy, it doesn&#x27;t even hurt!&amp;#34; No detangling spray, just this hairbrush! Unbelievably amazing product!</li>
    <li> Handles are a bit large but it works well.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t judge me when I say that I never owned an eyelash curler all my life. That is why I was really excited when I got the opportunity to purchase this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that my lashes curled after a few seconds. To my surprise, the curls stayed throughout the day even without mascara. I also love how this eyelash curler didn&#x27;t leave any marks on my face during the application. The lock at the bottom of the curler is a plus as well. The product came with 10 free replacement pads (as described by the seller) and surprise coupon code for the next purchase. The packaging is also nicely done. It is very enticing especially for first time customers.  I am really satisfied with this lash curler. I will definitely recommend it to my family and friends!</li>
    <li> Amazing curls are done by this particular eyelash curler. It is everything you want in a curler!! Plus you get 5, yes, 5 refill cushions!!! I just got it today &amp; I am already in love! Definitely interested in the other products Crave Naturals has to offer!!! :)</li>
    <li> Works like any other eyelash curler. Don&#x27;t believe the hype (like I did).It still punches because its still being used by my hands</li>
    <li> didnt like it hurts my eyes every time I use it its pinching my lashes in a bad way.</li>
    <li> Handles broke after only several uses! Quality not nearly as expected and is not worth the money. Very disappointed with this purchase!</li>
    <li> awesome brush I really like it.... I have long hair and it is hard to find a good brush YAH!</li>
    <li> My eyelashes are practically non-existent. Short of wearing fake eyelashes and tons of mascara, I didn’t know how to make my eyelashes stand out. Enter Whiplash by Crave Naturals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Whiplash comes in a very colorful box with a comic book type feel of graphics. The directions, cautions and disclaimer are printed right on the box. The curler comes complete with extra replacement pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Whiplash by Crave is very easy to use, and does not pull at your lashes. It only takes 20 seconds of light pressure to increase the curl in your eyelashes. After curling you simply add your mascara and go! I did notice more curl to my eyelashes, and once I applied mascara they were a lot more noticeable!</li>
    <li> Never again will I buy the cheap eyelash curlers. I can put this right up to my eye with out pinching it and my lashes stay curled forever ..Thank you Crave Naturals for making a great product!</li>
    <li> Came with more than 3 cushions which is awesome. Has a cute pink handle and instructions how to use if needed. I had no problems with the cushions not fitting. They are a perfect fit.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is any better than any other eyelash curler I have used previously.</li>
    <li> I love this curler because it WORKS! My lashes are not so great but this curler really makes them look great! I love that it has the perfect curve to it, which helps get all my lashes. It also has a tight spring that really curls them and this really cool locking mechanism that helps keep the curler closed. Not to mention you also get extra cushion refills which helps ensure this product will last and preform at its best for years to come. If you have been searching for a great curler-this is the ONE!</li>
    <li> I wish i found out about this curler earlier! First off the packaging alone is beautiful, unique and attractive! The curler itself has such a unique design, love the pick handle and lock! Lastly it works wonders on my lashes! It has a firm grip and gives my lashes an instant curl that stays in place all day! Love that they give refills too! A must in my makeup tools collection and the only curler I will be using from now on!</li>
    <li> Love this curler. I swear by eyelash curlers &amp; would recommend this product to makeup lovers everywhere. When your lashes look good, you look good!!</li>
    <li> One of The Best curler in the market! Gives a dramatic curve, seems to find length that other curlers miss. Comfortable to use, too. I like it better that any other curler I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve tried several expensive ones &amp; this has outdone All! Easy to grip n curl!</li>
    <li> I love my new eyelash curler and Crave Naturals&#x27; customer service is wonderful.  They were quick and friendly and I would definitely recommend them for products!</li>
    <li> This is a great little curler!  Packaging is super appealing as well, so high five on that one!  So far I&#x27;ve experience no issues with this at all and love the replacement pads also! This is super for that girly girl who loves makeup! Def recommended for all wowmen!</li>
    <li> I have always wanted a eyelash curler. I have really long eyelashes already, but I&#x27;ve never been able to give them the full look. When reading the reviews I was a little worried by everyone saying that they didn&#x27;t like it, the replacement pieces ripped easy, I become uneasy, but I love it. It works, and honestly I think people just push to hard and rip the rubber pieces. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Pulls out all my lashes :( did not last long at all and the rubber constantly falls out. Not impressed by this product at all. I have really long and full lashes and I don&#x27;t want to use this product in fear it will take off all my lashes after using it and using it. Waste of money :(</li>
    <li> Excellent brush. Even my two year old enjoys brushing her hair now!</li>
    <li> I read all of the wonderful reviews about this eyelash curler...and I received mine yesterday. I want a refund!  The eyelash pads don&#x27;t line up properly nor does the curler itself.</li>
    <li> I tried to like this curler.  The package is awesome, the handles are PINK, the customer service is excellent.  The problem is, fundamentally, the curler is awful.  The pads do not stay in place.  They crack very quickly.  When they crack, your eyelashes will become trapped in the crack and pull out.  The curl isn&#x27;t that fantastic.  I get just as good of a curl from my drug store curler as I do from this one that cost 3x as much.  The little metal clip that snaps in to hold the handles closed popped off in less than a week.  I can&#x27;t just toss it in my makeup bag or I lose the pink pad and have to dig for it.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this curler at all.  I am baffled as to why there are so many great reviews.  I feel as though because Crave Natural pushes so hard for positive ones that there is guilt with leaving constructive criticism.  I know I feel rotten saying something works poorly when I want to like the company.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**This is the first review I have ever written on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve made 74 purchases on Amazon in the past 6 months.  The fact that I&#x27;m writing one says a lot.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler meets my expectations.. It&#x27;s so nice!</li>
    <li> The brush makes my hair and scalp feel so great. And in addition my granddaughter hates getting her hair combed and she cries.  Now that I am using this great hair product she loves it and no crying.  Her twin brother loves it too&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s gent;e with my lashes, it&#x27;s a definite upgrade from the Revlon &amp; Maybelline one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had. I love that it comes with extra pads and the curl I get is phenomenal! I&#x27;m going to be ordering more for my sis &amp; a few friends as gifts.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews that I&#x27;m seeing.  My product arrived nicely with 10 extra pads!  I took pictures of my eyelashes (which my husband and I both liked) and then of the product with the extra pads.  I love the construction.  I really like the closing section with that snaps in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw my other eyelash curler away and will be using this one from now on.  I like that my eyelashes didn&#x27;t come out on the pad like my old one did.  I like the ease of use.  I would be very happy to demonstrate the use of this product if needed.  I will be writing my own review on my blog and sharing it with friends and hoping that they will buy it!  I appreciate the coupon code we received!  This company is very caring and I&#x27;m happy to be working with them.</li>
    <li> Now the real question, how does this bad boy work? Does it do everything it says and is the the solution for women everywhere who have given up on eyelash curlers in the past? I didn’t feel awkward holding it so the comfort level was good. I didn’t end up in tears from my eyes being pinched or my lashes being pulled out one by one (or in clumps). My lashes were not darting out at odd angles and it did actually curl my lashes. By all accounts I’m going to say this is a huge victory! I mean I don’t look like I ran out and bought extensions or anything, but there’s definitely a noticeable difference in the curvature of my lashes.I’m actually impressed and will definitely be continuing to use this particular eyelash curler. And did I mention it’s pink?? I mean come on, it’s always nice when the tools of the trade are nice to look at too. For the complete review check out [...]</li>
    <li> I love the design and it works well for my eyelashes without tugging. The box came with many replacements and they are going to last me a while!</li>
    <li> This product actually curls my lashes and it&#x27;s easy to handle. Extra bonus were the two refills included with purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a must have in a beauty product collection! This eyelash curler is the best I have tried and it does everything as promised the little pad falls out every now and then , BUT HEY THATS OKAY IT IS SO AWESOME that is does not matter , I don&#x27;t have to worry about losing anymore eyelashes and the box is So CUTE!!! And the handle is pink and it also has a clasp to make it easier to throw in your purse , Oh man Customer service was so WONDERFUL! The first one I got was defective I was going to send it back and they insisted that they send me a new one for the inconvenience LOL yes please AND the best part girlfriend is they sent me SUPER AWESOME GIFTS TOO!! These guys WILL make you happy, You have my word I do also recommend this to anyone and everyone its GREAT! I love the customer service so much that I will be purchasing from them again soon. MUCH LOVE EVERYONE! Give it a try ITS A WIN WIN SITUATION!!!!!!!! I LOVE CRAVE NATURALS! xoxoxoxo :)</li>
    <li> First off, this shipped not even 8 hours after I ordered it and came the next day! I opened the package right away, this eyelash curler is the bomb dot com! It is ergonomically designed so that you can make quick work of curling your lashes and it is very effective too! This is hands down the best curler I have ever owned!!! It also says it comes with two extra cushion pads, mine came with FIVE! Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;So worth the money!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using a cheap Revlon and wishing for something that didn&#x27;t pinch and leave marks by my nose. My eyes are kind of small and not conventionally shaped and I thought maybe I was stuck. I decided to invest in this curler based on others&#x27; reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did. I always had to stretch my eyelids around to get them in a good position to curl the lashes with the cheap curler; I don&#x27;t have to do that now and it&#x27;s taking some getting used to. All I have to do is put the curler up to my lashes and squeeze. My only (very minor) complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t get the lashes on the outermost corner but I can pick them up with the mascara wand.</li>
    <li> I have only used the cheap elf one before using this and i was skeptic at first. But this is an amazing eyelash curler. I didnt even need to put on mascara! This product definitely made my eyelashes dramatic and beautiful. This is now my favorite eyelash curler. It also is very pretty and very nice looking.  The box was so cute! Its hot pink inside. I will be keeping the box just because its too cute!</li>
    <li> I appear to be in the minority, but I did not like this curler because it ripped my lashes out.  The rubber pad was too soft, so when I attempted to curl my lashes, the top half of the curler cut into the pad.  As a result, my lashes got caught in that cut and they were ripped out.  And yes, I do know how to use an eyelash curler and have been using one since I was a teen.  It did come with five extra pads, and I switched out the cut pad for a new one, but (1) a brand new pad should not have been so easily cut, as I did not apply a great amount of pressure, and (2) I tested the curler by squeezing it without my lashes in it, and the second pad got cut as well.  I threw the eyelash curler away and have gone back to using my trusty Sephora one, which has never once pulled my eyelashes out.  Glad it worked for most other people, but I will never order this again and am not happy that I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I discovered this product. I was tired of curling my lashes multiple times a day to keep them looking how I like. This not only curls my eyelashes better than any other product I have tried, it keeps them curled all day long. My only problem was that the plastic handles broke when curling. I emailed the company on the off chance I could get a replacement. They emailed me back immediately letting me know they would replace it. Highly recommend this product not just because of my satisfaction with the results but also because of the wonderful customer service!</li>
    <li> This is yet another small company I have found through Amazon that has astounded me with fantastic customer service! The product is very well made, and don&#x27;t let the reviews about replacement pad issues scare you away. The company sends you an e-mail after purchasing the eyelash curler to explain the problems with the replacement pads (not all of the curlers are affected), and you simply need to e-mail them for replacements if you have any issues. They make it very easy and painless!</li>
    <li> Maybe my expectations were a bit high but this curler was just okay for me. You could find a cheaper one that does the same.</li>
    <li> I have tried about every eyelash curler on the market, and the whiplash curler is the best. It does not pinch the skin around my eyes, and makes my short lashes look amazing. It&#x27;s a little pricy but  worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> It curls well -- so long as the actual curler is not clipped closed at the bottom as it creases the eyelash pad, pulling eyelashes.  And the pink finger handle broke off (once again, the bottom travel clip seemed to put too much pressure and broke it off).  The grasp and curling are good, just skip the pesky clip!</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product and I have to say that I absolutely love it!! I curl my eyelashes once a day and they stay curl all day till I wash my face at night ;). The best part is that I am no longer getting pinched by old curlers and that it curls every single lash even the smallest one. :) Great birthday treat for myself.</li>
    <li> …because i haven&#x27;t used an eyelash curler since my teens but this curler does the job brilliantly and looks so chic!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t particularly notice much of a difference between this one and my cheap $2 drugstore one.  The curvature is definitely wider and probably helps with pinching for others, but I feel like it has the same issues as every other eyelash curler.  Very pretty and I love the pink rubber handles.</li>
    <li> Pinched my eye lid, pulled out some lashes, and didn&#x27;t curl well.  Plus, the wire piece that holds the 2 sides together locks while curling and if you are not aware you could do some serious damage to your lashes.  That problem went away when the wire metal piece went flying across the bathroom.  Horrible...</li>
    <li> its exactly what it needs to be. An eyelash curler. Love that its got a spring to open it back up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been going with a Maybelline standby for years until I got this as a gift.  A few days later, I lost my Whiplash and promptly ordered another because it&#x27;s that good.  It gets closer to the base, it curls both eyes the same and my lashes stayed curled all day instead of wilting an hour later.  Customer service seems great too.  I&#x27;ve got big, protruding eyes if anyone has similar eye type - works for me!  Also love that the grips clasp, so it&#x27;s less likely to get damaged or bend in a makeup bag.</li>
    <li> Way better than the standard Revlon or Trim curlers. Gentle on my eyelashes, and I love that it comes with extra pads. Has helped my eyelashes tremendously.</li>
    <li> The best eye lash curler I have EVER used. I had it all the way against my eyelids and it did not pinch it. My eye lashes curled right up, better than any other</li>
    <li> This was the worst eyelash curler I have ever tried.  It feels cheap, and the pad did not stay put.  I received a couple of emails from the company stating that there was a problem with some of the pads and that I would be receiving replacement pads, but they never came.  No matter because the thing basically fell apart after two weeks in my makeup bag.  I bought a Revlon curler at the drugstore, and it&#x27;s good enough for now. I&#x27;ve got an order with Shu Uemura on the way.</li>
    <li> Update: Customer service contacted me to apologize and sent me a new curler and two sets of pads, one shorter set and one longer set. The curler does work well with the right pads (the longer ones), so make sure you have them! I added an extra star for  good customer service and the fact that the curler works well with the right pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier review: This eyelash curler is really just okay. The pads kept popping out to the point that I finally tossed the whole curler out after several months of frustration. I would not say it has all the bells and whistles listed in the product description and is superior to other eyelash curlers I&#x27;ve tried in past years.</li>
    <li> This curler sat in my cabinet for a whole year before I could use it and the reason being, the second I got it - I decided to join the false lash craze and obviously couldn&#x27;t use it. Now that I&#x27;m off lashes, my real lashes have thinned out immensely :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With proper use of a good mascara (love the old tried and true Covergirl Lashblast) and Biotin, my lashes are making a come back and this curler is great! Seriously, NO PINCHING and it&#x27;s shaped perfectly for my almond eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped fast and it also came with all these bonus pink replacement pads - YAY!</li>
    <li> It works just as good as any other curler - it DOES seem to be pinch free though.  Not sure why, but it is!</li>
    <li> My eyelash curler is completely broken.  Within the first month the pink handles were cracked and then they came off... it is totally a useless piece of metal now. I am disappointed. Barely used it - and didn&#x27;t even travel with it. It is beyond me how they cracked so easily.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed I wanted to love this eyelash curler because I saw the reviews and it came with so many replacement pads! But I finally used it and both times I&#x27;ve tried I had lashes pulled and today I had lashes cut in half. I am so upset because now my lashes are completely uneven I can&#x27;t even wear mascara alone anymore. Well, I should of just stuck with my current lash curler...</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC curler! I love it! It doesn&#x27;t pinch, or pull and it curls my lashes like crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my new must have beauty tool because it opens up my eyes so well and creates these huge natural looking lashes. I sometimes like to wear falsies, and this tool also is great because it helps to bend and blend my lashes into the falsies, making them look very natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my mascara works better after using this curler and I love that it&#x27;s pink because I love the color! A definite must have for any makeup enthusiast!</li>
    <li> Its great! It doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes and I can curl my lashes without it hurting.</li>
    <li> I like this eyelash curler a great deal. I used several in the past and I feel this is far superior</li>
    <li> I LOVE my new eyelash curler! It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve owned to date. I have only gotten the plain stainless steel ones with no spring in the middle and no grip. To be quite honest when I saw this item up for review, it was the packaging that got my attention. I&#x27;m really glad that wasn&#x27;t the only great thing about these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They feel great in your hand because of the bigger plastic grip. They also come with plenty of replacement pads, definitely more than most curlers give you. I definitely did not pinch my eyelid with these like I used to on occasion with my old ones and it left my eyelashes beautifully curled .&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a new eyelash curler, this is the one to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I bought this curler based on the great reviews- I don&#x27;t understand.  This curler is one of the worst I have used.  It pinches eyelids and pulls my lashes out.  The extra cushions are needed since each cushion only lasts for a few uses before it starts pulling your lashes out.  It is also difficult to use, the spring mechanism is too tight.  DO NOT waste your money.</li>
    <li> Received this as a special deal for review.  I have tried to stay away from eyelash curlers because they usually hurt, and leave my eyelashes looking like I took a crimper to it. However on first try, I was pleasantly surprised, didn&#x27;t feel like a torture device had nice cushioning and left my eyelashes with a natural curl.  Love the way my eyes look more open.  I give it four stars because I didn&#x27;t like the size of the finger holes, made it slightly uncomfortable to use.  Other than that, excited to have something change my mind about eyelash curlers.</li>
    <li> First of all, I love the Pink color. Anything pink/purple will most of the time be a product I&#x27;d recommend (if it works great of course!) :). Next, I love the spring mechanism which makes the eyelash curler open until the handles are squeezed. Thus the metal lock at the bottom of the handles to keep it closed and locked when not used. :) This makes it easier for me to curl my lashes because once I let go of the handle, it automatically opens. :) I also like the 5 extra lash cushions included.</li>
    <li> The curler part broke on the first try. The two parts slipped out place. Trash. Not going to even bother sending it back.</li>
    <li> I did not order this.  I ordered Detangling Brush By Crave Naturals - Glide Thru Detangling Brush Works As a Detangler for Thick, Thin, Curly, Fine, Natural, Color Treated, Damaged, Wet or Dry Hair - No More Tangle - Adults &amp; Kids - Pink and Black Color.  So far, it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> I was SO excited about this eyelash curler, but when I got it I was surprised that it yeilded the same results as my cheap-o drug store purchase. Also, the pink soft inserts that your eyelashes push against falls out easily, so I need to be mindful with every use. My drugstore cheapo didnt do that. So I am a little confused - wondering what everyone else was using before to make them think this one was the bee&#x27;s knees. If I could go back, I wouldnt have spent this $$$&lt;br /&gt;It does seem like a good company</li>
    <li> I love how easy this curler is to use and it works great! It makes my short, blonde eyelashes to look gorgeous and long after I use the curler and add on my favorite mascara. I like that it comes with extra cushions so that way I can use this for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I got an email shortly after purchasing it asking me how I liked the product.  I responded honestly that I hate it and that it pulls out 3-4 eyelashes every time I use it.  I was promptly issued a refund AND sent another one.  Even though I don&#x27;t have the eyelashes to spare, I decided to keep using it to give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The metal top that squeezes the lashes down and against the cushion is just too sharp and cuts it because the cushion is just not a firm enough material to withstand that force.  Once it is cut, it does a great job pulling out lashes!  I found that if I change the cushion as soon as it starts to split, it dramatically reduced the eyelash removal.  Each eyelash curler had one cushion plus a bag of 10 refills for a total of 22 cushions.  I have less than 10 left after three weeks of use.  Once they are all gone, I will probably just toss both curlers unless the company has plans to replace the cushions with something much sturdier.</li>
    <li> I am not a stranger to the eyelash curler. In fact, I have worked with a number of products on enhancing my eye lashes and this, my friends, is a great addition to my little “collection.” The Whiplash Eyelash Curler that I received from Crave Naturals is a pretty pink, which I love, as pink is a large part of my wardrobe. Believe me when I say it is pretty, I even thought about using it as an accessory, not something I would suggest as it is very bulky as a necklace!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say I have medium eyelashes and have never really noticed a big difference in using curlers in the past but that was just something that I do as part of my regiment of using makeup. I saw some suggestions of using a blow dryer on the lashes and the curler to heat it up slightly and now, I will ALWAYS do that. It gives such the perfect curl to my lashes and a dramatic difference on top of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the fun packaging that my Whiplash came in; the retro picture on the front is too cute! The Whiplash also comes with replacement pads which sweetens the deal. Many people don’t realize it but you should always clean and replace your pads on your curlers as they are able to hold bacteria. YUCK! The eyelashes main purpose is to protect the eye from dirt and bacteria getting in the eye. However, a lot of ladies get infections because they do not sanitize and change out their eye products in a timely fashion. So, long story short, ALWAYS take care of your eyes!</li>
    <li> I hate leaving a bad review for a product but this eyelash curler has pinched most of my eyelashes off... And I don&#x27;t really have much to begin with. The metal that hits the rubber part is sharp. It ended up cutting through the rubber after a couple of uses. The curl doesn&#x27;t stay as long especially after I put on my mascara - it goes back my natural straight pointed down eyelashes. I really wanted this eyelash curler to work, I really wanted to love it but it hasn&#x27;t done what it is suppose to do. Maybe my eyelashes has issues but I have used a Revlon eyelash curler before and that has worked very well for me.</li>
    <li> Received this brush within days and it is AMAZING.  Seriously, a miracle worker. I have tried so many combs, brushes, detanglers and conditioners on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair over the past few years and ordered this brush with skepticism.  I was shocked at how easy and painless it was to detangle her beautiful locks.  So relieved to have found this.  Follow up from the vendor was great as well.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> The Whiplash curler works really well and I love the construction! No broken eyelashes, no crimps, and no bends. (If it helps, I&#x27;m of Asian descent with double eyelids and eyelashes that are straight or curl downwards into my eye.) It is very comfortable to hold and the handle grips provide a sense of security and strength so that your fingers don&#x27;t slip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pad that was in the curler cracked after I&#x27;ve used it five times, but I expected this to happen after getting the email about problems with the pads. This hasn&#x27;t happened to me when I&#x27;ve used other eyelash curlers, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m misusing it. I kept the curler at home and never heated it up, so I don&#x27;t think heat is causing the issue (unless it was shipped in unfavorable conditions?) Not sure how long the ten replacement pads will last, but we&#x27;ll see. The metal part of the curler holding the pad that moves up&amp;down is wobbly, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the performance of the curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service by Crave Naturals is top-notch! They ship fast and communicate clearly and promptly. They seem to really care about their customers. I would definitely do business with them again!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t pinch no matter how close I get to my lash line.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend just received the Whip Lash curler and she is really disappointed with it. The item box came damaged. With one try the eye lash pad split already.  She replaced it with a new pad from the extra it comes with but it doesn&#x27;t fit right. The pad is falling out of the curler.</li>
    <li> I like it but sometimes it grabs my eyelids, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I curl my lashes wrong or...</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is large enough for people with big eyes, which is what I was looking for to avoid getting pinched and getting my eye lashes ripped out. It does add some extra curl, but doesn&#x27;t give me the doll eye lash look that I&#x27;m used to. It may just be because I need to get use to using a new style of curler. Customer service is great- I had an issue with the first one I purchased and they quickly sent me a new one with extra pads! That&#x27;s rare! :)</li>
    <li> I have read horror stories of eyelash curlers! Cutting off lashes? Geez! My daughter wanted one and she&#x27;s 14 and I&#x27;m strict and against makeup at this age when beauty is so much better natural.  However, having extremely long lashes myself, I know the value of curling them when wearing glasses/sunglasses! I decided to give these ones a try and well, my daughter is very happy with it! She loves how they curl her lashes up and keep those long lashes from being so ornery! Easy to use and the packaging was attractive for a 14 year old :)</li>
    <li> Great product and amazing customer service.&lt;br /&gt;Received enough refills to last me quite a while!&lt;br /&gt;The curler is very sturdy and curls lashes very effectively.&lt;br /&gt;Price is great too! All in all, an awesome buy!</li>
    <li> Have used Revlon eyelash curlers since I started wearing eye makeup 20+ years ago. The Revlon design was recently changed and the change was not for the better. Had to seek an alternative and was pleasantly surprised by whip lash. For starters, I love the the packaging. The ergonomic design is great, lining up lashes is easy, curling is painless, and the beautiful bend/curl is the best I&#x27;ve seen on my lashes. Lashes do not stick to the pads, even with mascara already applied. So glad I found this little gem.</li>
    <li> Best eyelash curler I have ever used! Curls lashes and stays curled for the remainder of the day! 10 replacement pads came with it and the box is so cute! I am very happy with this purchase :)</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for, except this one is so affordable!  Works great so far, can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> We love the new brush. I bought it for my youngest daughter. She uses it every 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> I receive this product for free for review purposes. I was under no obligation to write a positive review or sponsor a giveaway in return for the free tickets or product. Any opinions express are completely 100% my own based on my experience and are not influenced by any form of compensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m like every other woman out there. We want long, beautiful, full eyelashes! I&#x27;m so glad that I had the chance to review these eyelash curler. They work pretty dang on amazing! I&#x27;m absolutely in love with them. It gave my eyelashes that long, full look. When I put on the mascara with it, it made them look thicker and longer as if I had fake lashes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the comic book packaging! It&#x27;s so different then all those other ones out there. And it&#x27;s PINK! I&#x27;m talking about the curler, it&#x27;s pink. I love pink! It&#x27;s so girly! :) Not only did I receive the curler but I also received 10 extra refill pads instead of 5 like it said in the description and a coupon code for 25% off. Yep, this is going to last along time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like how easy it was to use. You have to put a little bit more pressure when you curl your eyelashes but guess what? It didn&#x27;t matter to me because they made the curls look like curls instead of a crimp and it made the curls last a lot longer than normal. I love how I can get real close to the base of my eyelashes without pinching my skin. It was smooth sailing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I liked about receiving this product was it came with instructions. You would think people who curl their eyelashes would know how to do it but for those who never used a eyelash curler before in their life will now be able to use them with ease. One thing to note is that I did not know that it&#x27;s best to curl your eyelashes BEFORE putting on your mascara. Guess I learned something new! Learning something new is always a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know, the picture kind of looks a bit creepy with just my eyes! But here you can see my before, after and after with mascara. Truly a major difference in my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told my husband that I needed to review the Whiplash Eyelash Curler, apparently he must have missed the curler part because after I curled my eyelashes and put on my mascara he looked at me and said, &amp;#34;wow those fake eyelashes look amazing on you.&amp;#34; I just started laughing and said &amp;#34;babe, these are my real eyelashes. I don&#x27;t have fake eyelashes on. Remember I said that I was going to review the eyelash CURLER?&amp;#34; He looked again and said, &amp;#34;Man those curlers really do bring your lashes out.&amp;#34; I said &amp;#34;Thank you, I&#x27;m glad you like them!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very impressed with these eyelash curlers. Easy to use and easy storage. Definitely recommend this product to all those out there who curl their eyelashes!before, after and after with mascara.

    <li> My Eyes and Eyelashes: (singing to myself, “snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes...these are a few of my favorite things... “)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a great eyelash curler, I have hooded eyelids (heavy lids). As a result of my hooded eyes, I have been searching high and low for solutions for hooded eyes (without surgery.) The solution, for me, is anything that would help bring out my lashes so my eyes would pop.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily for me I have fairly long eyelashes, however they don&#x27;t curl on their own and the hooded lids hide them to a certain extent.... my eyelids are so hooded that I had a beautiful Asian dentist once, who I admired her lash extensions on her and while we were talking about the outrageous price to have them done, she told me that “OMG, you have Asian Eyes!”&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried false eyelashes:&lt;br /&gt;The old fashioned false eyelashes are hard to put on and if you have oily lids like I do you cannot depend on them to stay on at all. Nothing like wearing these strip eyelashes and having one side or another lift off the eyelid, how embarrassing and it&#x27;s only funny if you were Lucille Ball.&lt;br /&gt;My Mother told me about the do it yourself false lashes that can stay on for up to 3 weeks, her nurse at the hospital had them on and they were beautiful! (Yes, even this old lady still listens to her Mother.) HOWEVER the small groups of eyelash falsies, have a downfall... you can see the adhesive and you can feel it scratching at your eyelids. They are even more diffucult to put on than the old fashioned strip false eyelashes and they work best if you do not use mascara with them as it can dislodge them easily with the mascara wand. and washing off your mascara you are most likely removing the lashes, most all eye makeup removers contain oils and this acts as a solvent, removing the adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried having my lashes done professionally, as I mentioned above, it&#x27;s just so very expensive to have done.&lt;br /&gt;After trying the above and ruling out one alternative, I came to one conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;I had to try and find a eyelash curler that worked for me. And hopefully I would find one that I would actually use more often then the pinchers, that I did have.&lt;br /&gt;My Personal Eyelash Curler Story (from years ago... I won&#x27;t say how many. Lol):&lt;br /&gt;When I was a teenager I used my eyelash curler one day while getting ready for school and it pinched my eyelid so terrible that I forgot myself and yanked the curler away fast... the results, I pulled out most of my eyelashes on that eyelid. And for quite a while afterward I had to disguise the fact that I was walking around without eyelashes on that lid. I used eyeliner and stopped wearing my contacts for a while, hoping that no one would notice. Luckily for a teenager with low self esteem, no one ever said anything, though I am willing to bet they noticed. As a result of that experience, I have a fear of doing the same thing myself again. I have been searching for a non pinch eyelash curler ever since.&lt;br /&gt;My Search for the Perfect Lash-curler:&lt;br /&gt;Before I received my eyelash curler from Crave Naturals, I have had 3 seldom used eyelash curlers in my arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;One eyelash curler was the old fashioned flimsy metal lash curlers that still pinched.&lt;br /&gt;The Second lash-curler was a super small lash (width wise) curler that I could use, as long as I was careful, without pinching but took many many repeats across the eyelashes to get the whole row of lashes curled and this little item was still flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;The third lash-curler was a cheap plastic folding eyelash curler, that was compact enough to travel with, but being made cheaply it could break fairly easily and it also pinches the eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I found the perfect eyelash lash-curler:&lt;br /&gt;When I received the Whiplash Lash Curler I was skeptical since I had searched, for a majority of my life, for the perfect eyelash curler, but I was more than happy to try!&lt;br /&gt;The box with my Eyelash Curler in it is so cute with it&#x27;s Graphic Novel or Comic Strip looking Woman on the label, I have even kept the box and will probably display the box on a shelf with the extra rubbers in it. No, no no, not that kind of rubbers, but the kind that are used in the eyelash curler. Speaking of the rubber inserts for the curler, this beautiful eyelash curler comes with 5 extra replacement pads for this beauty! The most I had ever gotten was one with my eyelash curlers, if I got any.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I was tickled as pink as the rubber pads and handle on this beauty, knowing that it came with 5 additional rubber pads... I do think that I may squeezed too hard on the curler as I had one of the pads actually break (after several very successful uses previous).  Upon changing the rubber on this curler, I discovered that these pretty pink pads feel less cushy than the ones that were on my other lash curlers. Interestingly enough each of these little pads already comes indented in the middle where the metal curler meets up with the pad. Perhaps his indentation along with the fact that the rubber is less pliable than on other curlers was partly the cause of the breakage? I&#x27;ve been more careful ever since this happened and I haven&#x27;t had another one break on me yet.&lt;br /&gt;The area you insert your fingers into is the most comfortable fit &amp; comfortable to squeeze as compared to all other lash curlers I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;Their claim that your lashes will last curled up for a long long time, is without a doubt true for me. In the past I&#x27;ve had to use my blow dryer or extra extra carefully, us my curling iron to heat up the curler (without the curling iron touching the rubber pad) to get a good curl, with this lash curler I get that extra long lasting curl without the fuss.&lt;br /&gt;And most importantly I can use this curler without worries of pinching my lids, and now I have a curler that I use much more often than any other one I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;Before I forget, for those ladies that are new to using an eyelash curler:&lt;br /&gt;the best way to use them is not just once on your lashes. Start at the base of your lashes, hold for a few seconds, then go up further on the lashes and repeat, you will have better results as you then have added a nice curl throughout the lash instead of just at one portion of you lashes. :)&lt;br /&gt;OH and hey... This Eyelash Curler is a real beauty don&#x27;t you think? What girl couldn&#x27;t resist that?lash Curler in it is so cute with it&#x27;s Graphic Novel or Comic Strip looking Woman on the label, I have even kept the box and will probably display the box on a shelf with the extra rubbers in it. No, no no, not that kind of rubbers, but the kind that are used in the eyelash curler. Speaking of the rubber inserts for the curler, this beautiful eyelash curler comes with 5 extra replacement pads for this beauty! The most I had ever gotten was one with my eyelash curlers, if I got any.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I was tickled as pink as the rubber pads and handle on this beauty, knowing that it came with 5 additional rubber pads... I do think that I may squeezed too hard on the curler as I had one of the pads actually break (after several very successful uses previous).  Upon changing the rubber on this curler, I discovered that these pretty pink pads feel less cushy than the ones that were on my other lash curlers. Interestingly enough each of these little pads already comes indented in the middle where the metal curler meets up with the pad. Perhaps his indentation along with the fact that the rubber is less pliable than on other curlers was partly the cause of the breakage? I&#x27;ve been more careful ever since this happened and I haven&#x27;t had another one break on me yet.&lt;br /&gt;The area you insert your fingers into is the most comfortable fit &amp; comfortable to squeeze as compared to all other lash curlers I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;Their claim that your lashes will last curled up for a long long time, is without a doubt true for me.

    <li> I have very fine and curly hair which I have struggled to comb all my life. My hair is also very lightweight and that makes my hair very prone to tangles. This brush is the first in me life to detangle my hair easily, fast, and without breakage.</li>
    <li> Before I even received my order, I received a communication from Crave Naturals advising me that they were aware of an issue with the replacement pads for the Whiplash.  They promised to send new pads soon.  I thought that would not be an issue, as I would just use the original pad for a while anyway.  Unfortunately, the pad in the curler is also defective.  Every time I squeeze and release the curler, the pad pops out and I have to catch it.  This is a pain in the neck.  In addition, although other reviewers say it doesn&#x27;t, it pinches.  And it&#x27;s more painful than any other eyelash curler I&#x27;ve used.  Finally, it does not curl my lashes.  It just bends them at a 90 degree angle.</li>
    <li> Brilliant product! My 2 1/2 year old no longer says &#x27;owie&#x27; when I brush her hair. Her hair is very fine and tangles easily. This brush WORKS on either wet or dry hair!!!!</li>
    <li> I have never given anything I have written a review for 1 star. The first one I got, the rubber wouldn&#x27;t stay in long enough to even get close to your eye.. I returned it and they replaced it, it was better, but no cigar.. The final straw was I tried it again today, not only is it uncomfortablely close to the eye, it feels like it&#x27;s going into my eye.. Here is the biggy, like I mentioned I tried it again today and looked at my lashes while I was putting on my mascara on and I say to myself, why are those lashes so much shorter, ( I have kind of long lashes) and see stuck in the curler about 5 chopped off eyelashes in the curler..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say it does curl your lashes, but so does my cheaper ones and they don&#x27;t cut my lashes off..</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is pretty good, my eyelashes stay curled all day and it came with 5 extra refill rubber. The only thing I have to say is that they should make one for smaller eyes.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent eyelash curler. There is minimal pulling with it, and it just feels really sturdy like it will last for a long time. The problem I encountered was that the refill pads did not fit, and when I contacted the seller about it they assured me they would send the correct pads in 5-10 days, but they never arrived. I couldn&#x27;t use the curler much after that first pad flattened out; I curl my lashes a lot, so one pad only last about a month. I re contacted them, and this time they sent the refill pads in just a couple of days with a coupon for 50% off anything else. I was quite appreciative of the promptness with the service the second time. I would definitely recommend the curler; it works really well with the correct pads!</li>
    <li> I love the Whiplash Eyelash curler. It works perfectly. It is very easy to use. I am 40 years old and am not a fan of wearing make-up but Whiplash Eyelash curler works easily. I love how my eyelash curl. I highly recommend this product to everybody. It works like magic. You should try it too.</li>
    <li> Super cute packaging and love the results of my plans with this. I&#x27;ll soon have a review post on my beauty blog.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product got so many 5 star reviews. I really wanted to like this, but it works terribly. Not only does this not curl my eyelashes, but the pink rubber piece won&#x27;t stay in its proper place and constantly comes out whenever I press down to curl my lashes. I&#x27;ve attempted to replace the pink piece several times, with the same result. Looks cute, great box, but faulty product. So sad, I&#x27;m back to my old boring eyelash curler--but at least it works.</li>
    <li> I like the style of this eyelash curler.  I holds well in your hand and does not pinch your lids.  However, I can&#x27;t say that it curls lashes any better than a Revlon or other eyelash curler.  I mainly think that none of these curlers work as well anymore because of the more &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; piece that sits in the curler where your eyelashes go.  It used to be more &amp;#34;rubbery&amp;#34; and did a much better job at curling the lashes than whatever they&#x27;re making this piece out of these days.  Kind of disappointed considering the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this item less than three months ago, and a few weeks ago it started to fall apart. Yesterday, one of the pink finger holds actually snapped in half while I was using the curler. The pads inside are made from a cheap material as well, and don&#x27;t hold up well at all, creasing and leaving a deep ditch down the length of the pad...it comes with replacements and I&#x27;ve already had to replace them twice. I might as well just stick with my old trusty Revlon curler bought at a drugstore. Skip this curler.</li>
    <li> Great eyelash curler! It does the job just fine. Built much sturdier than the ones I have bought previously from the drugstore. Love that refills come with it too. Good product!</li>
    <li> This product has been sitting in my drawer for over two months.. I had actually forgotten about it.. I did receive an email shortly after ordering that the company was addressing some problems with the pads that were included.. I did find the pads that came with in just didn&#x27;t fit properly and kept popping out. I tried it a few times and just got frustrated and threw it in the drawer. A forgettable product.. Don&#x27;t bother! My fault for not returning it when I had the chance..</li>
    <li> Best eyelash curler.  Better results than the She Umera.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this eye curler because my eyes look so beautiful. Whip lash will give you the effect of wider eyes and will make you look more awake. You can see the difference with a makeup with eye curler because the eyes look bigger and the lashes are longer with an amazing curl. You can see the difference in photos, and your makeup is going to look more professional. Also you are going to need less mascara. If you&#x27;ve never used a curling iron I recommend to use this one, it works perfect, is pink, you get 10 extra pads, lifetime guarantee, and you can travel with it.</li>
    <li> It works much better on my daughters curly hair then a regular brush!</li>
    <li> This package came earlier than I expected, and it&#x27;s awsome! I like how I looks and my lash look great also.</li>
    <li> Just received this curler and so far I really like it.  My eyelashes do not like to stay curled and this curler seems to keep them curled for longer. Supplying the extra cushions is terrific.  I also like that it closes up and makes it easier for traveling.</li>
    <li> This product is quality! I&#x27;ve never had to use an eyelash curler before, but I wish I had tried one sooner! My lashes have somewhat of a curl to them but now, WOW, they look even better.</li>
    <li> i got it yesterday and started using it this morning. It did wonders for my tired morning eyes. It helped me look more awake.</li>
    <li> Does a good job. A big upgrade over my old Revlon curler. My daughter immediately tried to snatch it from me, so it looks like I&#x27;ll be ordering another.</li>
    <li> After reading some great reviews on this curler I was excited to try it. I love curled lashes. I am very disappointed. It takes way to long to get a curl, I have to hold it down for a while. Even then the curl doesn&#x27;t last long. As soon as I put on my mascara my lashes loose the curl. I have been curling my lashes for at least 15 years and have never had this bad of an experience with an eyelash curler. I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have thrown out the box when I got it because I sure would have returned it. I get frustrated every time I have to use it and it takes so much longer to do my makeup now because I can&#x27;t get this thing to actually work. I have had better luck with much less expensive curlers. This was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I ordered mine a while back based on Amazon reviews. I am very pleased with my order. The curler looks very fashionable. It comes with replacement pads. I have been using it almost every day. It works well. Just a few days ago, however, the upper plastic handle broke off. I contacted the seller. Within days, I received my replacement curler with quite a few replacement pads. I am very happy with the whole experience.</li>
    <li> Super cute, great quality and comes with a bunch of replacement pads! I also love the latch to hold it shut while I&#x27;m traveling with it. And excellent customer service from the company who makes it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the reviews on this are so good.  Right out of the box I was underwhelmed by the quality.  Kind of chinsy.  Then it pulled my eyelashes out after using it for one week.</li>
    <li> LOVE this eyelash curler! Great design, comfortable fit.. will encourage others to buy from the seller. (And the box is adorable)</li>
    <li> I loved it at first. The first week or so. Then after that it seemed like the rod part became loose and only half of my lashes were curled because the other half would not reach my lashes. Pretty disappointed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update**&lt;br /&gt;So after my review I received a call from the seller saying she was very sorry about my order. Very very nice of her...many people do not do that anymore. So major points for that. She stated she would send me out another curler. I got the shipment very fast. But as soon as I took it out of the box, the top bar rod was again crooked. Am I just getting defective ones?? I don&#x27;t understand. I wish I could take a picture so you could see . again only half of my lashes curl. I really think I would LOVE this product..because the part that that actually curls does great. But only half does :(  I did receive an email saying to contact the seller but the email address itself was deleted. But I did bump up a star because of the great customer service.</li>
    <li> Update on 23rd of August 2014:  After many trials with the new one, I now have beautiful eye lashes after using the curler in 2 steps: about a third closer to the top and then as close as possible to the roots. It doesn&#x27;t take a long time to achieve a natural curl, but the curling surely lasts all day (curl, then use mascara). And on top of that, this curler does not pinch the skin.    Original post on 3rd of March 2014:  This eyelash curler didn&#x27;t work for me as it did for other reviewers. I tried it many times, and even contacted Crave Naturals, who sent me a new one hoping it would work better. With both of them, I had to spend more than 10 seconds (as stated on the instructions) to get a curl, then in less than an hour the curl would be gone. I am very pleased with customer service who did everything they could to improve my experience with this product. For the ones who are satisfied with its performance, coming with free extra cushions is even better.</li>
    <li> I was able to try and review one of these awesome eyelash curlers for my blog and I really think its a great product and the very best eyelash curler I have ever used . I love that it comes with extra cushion pads and it helps you really have control over curling your lashes with out damaging them.</li>
    <li> I previously had issues with the first curler I purchased. It didn&#x27;t seem to be aligned but everything else about the product was great. After the seller has contacted me letting me know that maybe my curler is defective, I am very pleased with this, because not all sellers on here will do this. I got my second one in the mail a few days ago and I&#x27;m not having the same issues I had with it the first time. I really like the box that it comes in, it also comes with (I think) 10 extra refill pads, and that there is a little metal hook loop thing the keeps your curler handles connected and closed so it is smaller for traveling or storing. I am really satisfied with the seller feedback though. They contacted me almost immediately and helped me out. If I ever need to buy here again, I will with no hesitation.</li>
    <li> This review is for the Glide Thru Detangling Brush... for some reason the eyelash curler is showing for my space to write review...?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the Glide Thru Detangling Brush  is excellent!  First time my daughter used it (waist length hair) she exclaimed &amp;#34;Whoa, amazing!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;And, so it is... buy it, now!&lt;br /&gt;Detangles and is kind to your scalp.</li>
    <li> I really like the eyelash curler! My only issue is that the pink insert keeps popping out on the side making it hard to curl my lashes. I do like that it has a lot of extra pink pads.</li>
    <li> I have tried lots of eyelash curlers and this is the best one by far! I have really small eyes and this does not pitch my skin and it gets all my lashes without giving them a weird crimp. You know what I mean ladies! Worth the price too.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product and service.  I&#x27;ve had an eyelash curler that was too big? or fit poorly?  Something was wrong.  Surprisingly, this curler is able to contact my lashs, even at a distance. Also they sent me tips for hair care that I found helpful (like drying hair w/ a t shirt which is soft and won&#x27;t break ends...)  Really good experience w/ the product and this company.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I am sometimes lured in by flashy marketing, so when I saw the colorful packaging, I was curious. But, I read the reviews and decided to buy it. Glad I did! It works well, makes a nice, natural looking curl and lasts all day. Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Great curler and company is super cute!  Gives you tips on how to curl your lashes. And they stand behind their product.  Love that!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an eyelash curler before, so I can&#x27;t say that it is so much better than any other. This is easy to use, came with 10 extra pads (not just 5) and curls my lashes well.</li>
    <li> I have used many different eyelash curlers over the years, usually typical drugstore brands (Revlon, Sally Hansen, etc) that cost $5 to $8.  But I decided to try this one based on the reviews, even though it costs about 3x as much.  I like the feel of this eyelash curler, and it does a good job of grabbing all my lashes.  But the cushion pads are a huge flaw.  The eyelash curler cuts into them and splits them within 5 days of normal use.  Once this happens, the somewhat sticky inside of the cushion pad pulls my lashes out.  While this happens to most cheap drugstore brands of eyelash curlers, it usually doesn&#x27;t happen for a couple months of daily use. When I bought the Whiplash curler a few weeks ago, it came with 2 extra cushions.  Now I see it comes with 5 extra cushions (for the same price I paid).  Is this perhaps in response to the fact that the cushion pads do not hold up??  If they could fix this issue, it would be a very good curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I wanted to post an update to my review. Today I was contacted by the owner of Crave Naturals, who was looking for feedback on this product. I told her what I said in my review above. She was grateful for my feedback, and offered to send me a large pack of extra eyelash cushions. I was impressed with the high level of customer service and her drive to improve the product. Definitely some of the best customer service I&#x27;ve encountered! And I suspect the problem I found with the cushions will be resolved soon.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s because of my eyes but somehow this curler worked really well on my right eye but on the left, it couldn&#x27;t grab lashes at their base and it couldn&#x27;t grab the ones near the corner of the eyes either, as opposed to how it works on the right. But over all, it was easy to hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;After owning this product for a couple months, I can say I came to not like it. Not only is it made with cheap looking materials , the rubber pad cracks easily, as I am already down to my last pad. When the pad cracks, it tends to catch my lashes and rip them out as I curl them. I would NOT recommend this to people looking for an effective, wallet friendly lash curler.</li>
    <li> Great product! Makes my lashes look longer. Had no problems  with purchase.  Great price  and received very quickly. I would buy from this seller again</li>
    <li> First, I did not buy an eyelash curler, I bought a set of eyebrow brushes from this company.  They arrived in a cute little pink box but the head of one brush was detached/broken from the handle.  Furthermore, the bristles on the brow brush were too soft to use for its intended purpose.  I just tossed the whole thing in the trash!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite brush! Works great on wet or dry hair that is normally like brushing a thick, tangled frizzy bush. I definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I really like how this curled my lashes... BUT its a cheaply made.  About a month after buying it, the handle broke, I glued it. Now the side of the metal that covers your eyelid has come unsodered.</li>
    <li> The rubber pieces constantly fall out of the metal part. Irritating!</li>
    <li> This is the best eyelash curler i&#x27;ve ever owned. I cannot believe how great it is. I curl my lashes in the morning, apply my mascara and they&#x27;re still curled at the end of the day when I get home from work. It is really amazing. Great bonus: it includes a ton of replacement pads. Only thing to consider: I was curling my lashes yesterday and the metal &amp;#34;clasp&amp;#34; closed, I think i hit it with my finger. Had a bit of a freak out while my husband released the latch. I wiggled the clasp and removed it from my curler. I will hold onto it though and use the clasp when i travel to keep the curler closed. Still think it is the best!</li>
    <li> Great product! No complaints at all</li>
    <li> Love the pink color and super comfortable. No more painful eyelash curling.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for my lashes, not a long lasting curl for sure. Also, the rubber/silicone pads split very quickly.</li>
    <li> Excellent eyelash curler that doesn&#x27;t punch at all and comes with a lifetime, satisfaction guarantee. It gets all my lashes in one curl and makes them look great. I also like that you can lock it in the shut position so it doesn&#x27;t take up much room in your make-up bag. I was contacted immediately by the company regarding a potential issue with the eyelash pad not  fitting properly and they promptly sent me 15 extra refill pads at no charge and have followed up with me several times. EXCELLENT customer service!</li>
    <li> Love the spring in this eyelash curler, you don&#x27;t have to squeeze hard at all to get a good curl!</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to using this eyelash curler. I was never able to use it correctly because the rubber replacement kept falling out. Yes, this eyelash curler comes with several rubber replacements but unfortunately they all fall out.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this eyelash curler, it fits my eye shape perfectly. However I have now ordered 3 different curlers because after about 2 months the plastic pink handles fall off.  I will no longer be ordering this product because an eyelash curler should last longer than 2-3 months before falling apart. I&#x27;m very disappointed because I love the way this curler worked on my lashes, the little metal handle that grips the 2 pink handles is great for that extra lift...but considering it keeps falling a part, I can&#x27;t order this again. If y&#x27;all improve it, please let me know. Or if u can refund the money I have spent on broken eyelash curlers or even replace the curlers, ANYTHING to make this right.... Then I will write a good review on this curler. It&#x27;s a good curler, it just falls apart very very quickly.</li>
    <li> Love it. Comes with extra pads for curling.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler works really well.</li>
    <li> Great eyelash curler. Easy to use, feels good in your hand and I haven&#x27;t pinched my eyelid yet. Like all the additional pads too!</li>
    <li> I had bought one and it was perfect, I loved it. My first one had broke because of a baby playing with it. So I purchased another one because I had loved it so much. The new one I received sucked. The curler was uneven. Did not curl my lashes at all like my other one. I may end up returning it.</li>
    <li> I have lost count of how many different types of eyelash curlers I have tried. This one really takes the cake! The design of the curler is very ergonomic and feels sturdy in my hand. Just the slightest bit of pressure when curling gives phenomenal curl and also extends the life of the pads. I actually received 10 refill pads with my order instead of the stated 5, which was an awesome surprise. I can&#x27;t see myself using any other type of eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> Wonderful eyelash curler!  It is the best I have ever used.  It&#x27;s worth the extra money for the product.</li>
    <li> LOVE this eyelash curler. My eyelashes look fuller and thicker and I have fairly short lashes so this is awesome! It&#x27;s my neww BFF! Love my whiplash curler and love Crave Naturals! THANKS CraveNaturals!</li>
    <li> This lash curler works AMAZING!! Definitely worth the money, and their customer service is awesome too!</li>
    <li> I really love this eyelash curler!  I have been using it for several months.  I recently requested more pads and they sent me a bunch of them for free!  What a great company!!!</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash curler! The handle is so much easier to handle and use, the curler grasps my lashes and curlers with ease. Comes in a cool box and gives my makeup counter so funk lol</li>
    <li> This product works really well and makes your eye lashes much longer then them naturally, cute packaging too :)</li>
    <li> UPDATE: So about a month ago the left side of the curler popped out, I&#x27;ve tried several times to pop it back in and it worked for a bit but doesn&#x27;t anymore. My husband tried pinching it closed but no dice.  Won&#x27;t be getting this product again.  I&#x27;ve never had that happen with a curler before.  So far so good, I&#x27;ve been very happy.  I haven&#x27;t had to deal with pulled out lashes and as is I don&#x27;t have many!! I love the fact that it came with 10 refill pads which I think is quite generous.  No pinching, probably the best eyelash curler I have purchased so far.</li>
    <li> This eyelash cutler has a lifetime guarantee and lots if replacement pads!  This alone compared to some other brands is huge. Takes a bit of getting used to vs my other cutler but I am liking the results so far.</li>
    <li> it works. but it&#x27;s not worth 15$</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this and it got such good reviews I wanted to give it a try. I loved that it came with so many refills and provided a good curl. However, after just a couple of months of use (probably 2-3 times per week) the top metal bridge popped out one day as I was using it.  In the several decades I have owned and used eye lash curlers this has never happened to me.  I was lucky I did not get hurt.</li>
    <li> i really like this eyelash curler, it makes my eyelash long and beautiful, the curler is good quality and in lovely pink color. i really recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I had gotten so used to my old, inexpensive eyelash curler from the drugstore, that I didn&#x27;t realize how awful it really was until I tried the Whiplash Eyelash Curler! Really well designed. Fits beautifully in your hand. Larger than normal so you get ALL of you lashes. And, no pinching! A GREAT purchase!</li>
    <li> I have tried several different eyelash curlers and I love this one. It curls lashes but doesnt stick them together and doesnt pull them out.</li>
    <li> Works great! Love all the extra cushions.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the product. It works perfectly and fits comfortably into my hand. I can&#x27;t wait to use it more!</li>
    <li> Just used it a few times so far but it seems to work just fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very hesitant using eyelash curlers because if they aren&#x27;t the nice ones sometimes it breaks my eyelashes. This product is awesome!  I barely squeeze and it totally curls my lashes.  It also fits great so it doesn&#x27;t pinch the end of my eye lids.  It came with a lot of rubber refills! Must try! I love my new curlers!!!</li>
    <li> This product gets a good pinch to curl your lashes but you need to watch out for lashes being pulled out. I have chunks of lashes missing on the right eye, the outer edge and on the left eye, the inside edge.  The spring meant to hold the curler together when your not using it can lock while your using IT, then your eye lash/lid is pinched, gets stuck and hurts.  When I tried to undo it, the plastic piece flew off across the room.  Take out the first cushion placed in the eyelash curler and place one of the replacements, they work better and pinched lashes is reduced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an eyelash curler and I do like the look. I&#x27;ll be trying your suggestion, heating the curler with a blow-dryer.&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes do look nicer. Thank you  for the email you sent me with additional tips.</li>
    <li> Love this eyelash curler, it&#x27;s super cute and it does the job well and if you know what you doing it&#x27;s indeed pinch free!</li>
    <li> At first i was very skeptical about using an eyelash curler because Ive never used one before i was always afraid that i would poke my eye out or cut some of my eyelashes off until i got my hands on this baby right here I am very happy and excited that i got the opportunity to use this product because normally i just use mascara to enhance my eyelashes and since using this product i realize ive couldve been using an eyelash curler to help enhance them !</li>
    <li> Very professional business- great to work with</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash curler! I gave up on using eyelash curlers because I got sick of the pinching, pads wearing down easily, etc. I saw that the Whiplash could offer a solution to those problems, and I&#x27;m glad I gave it a shot. They are comfortable to hold in my hand, I haven&#x27;t had any pinching, and the results are great! The pads are soft yet sturdy and easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closure latch is a big deal to me because, as a mom, anything that could pinch the kids&#x27; fingers is always a concern of mine. Although the closure latch is more for convenience, particularly when traveling, it does give me peace of mind that if they pick it up they wouldn&#x27;t be able to lift up the latch before I&#x27;d notice they got it out of my bag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more from an eyelash curler!</li>
    <li> I am a fan of this eyelash curler, until it broke on me! The curler is definitely different than others, when it broke and I had to go back to my old one, the difference was night and day. They give you extra pads (and as other reviewers said, you do go through the pads fairly quickly because the curler pinches so well) and it works well. Unfortunately, as I was curling my lashes one morning, one of the plastic handles snapped in half (that did NOT feel good). I would have given it 5 stars if not for that.</li>
    <li> this is the best curler ever! I have tried about 10 diffrent brand this one beats ALL of them! &amp; doe snot pull out my lashes!</li>
    <li> Since I don&#x27;t use a curler all the time, I was skeptical.  But I tried this curler and got great results with little effort.  The curl lasted beautifully!  The product was easy for me to handle and I had no trouble with using it.  I am happy with this curler!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing curler. I have hard to curl, straight lashes and big eyes. This does a wonderful job. I use it with my maybelline falsies mascara. I had a wonderful experience with the customer service as well. My first curler came a little bit damaged (the bottom part with the lash pad was slightly uneven). The company sent me another one with expedited shipping and my second one is perfect!</li>
    <li> Bad purchase for me. Pulled left part of my eyelashes out, on my left eye.  I ordered the highest rated eyelash curler after that, spending a bit more. It could just be my eyes,are longer than the average, but in previous eyelash curling experiences I never remembered pulling any lashes out. The Seller though seems very honest and willing to help you no matter what, so don&#x27;t be afraid to try it, as it just may work for you. It is pretty!  UPDATE 5-15-15: When I first reviewed this item I did not mention that I had caught my skin is this curler, as I thought it would go away! It is now  May 15, 2015 and 10 months later I still have a lump under my left eye that is quite large, from the middle of my left eye into the corner of my left eye because my skin got caught in the curler!  DO NOT BUY THIS CURLER...I don&#x27;t know if this will ever go away...it looks awful and I am extremely upset to come back and read that this curler is STILL BEING SOLD????????</li>
    <li> Amazing eyelash curler!!! my eyes have different shapes. my right eye is deeper than the left one. So I usually have to use 2 curlers with different shapes. But this eyelash curler works for both of my eyes! Can&#x27;t understand why but really love it :)</li>
    <li> This is an amazing eyelash curler! I&#x27;ve always been searching for an affordable eyelash curler from the drugstore, but none of them ever work for me (i.e. my lashes never curled, it takes too much effort and strength to get a decent curl, curl doesn&#x27;t hold up, etc.). All that money I spent on a variety of drugstore eyelash curlers added up, and I had about enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to invest in a good quality curler, so I went on Amazon (because who doesn&#x27;t love Amazon) to search for one, and I found that the Whip Lash Eyelash Curler by Crave Naturals had the most highest ratings. After reading many of the reviews, I purchased it with a discount code that I received from their website newsletter sign up, and got it for around $11.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested it out right away when it arrived to my house, and it barely took me any strength to get my lashes curled with the tool. I gently pressed down three times and BOOM! Lashes are curled! No pinching. The cushion pad was a little loose, but I was aware of this from the reviews I read prior to ordering.  I was provided with 10 extra cushion pads, so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me unless the cushion pad completely falls out of place which it didn&#x27;t. Nevertheless, my lashes looked amazing. Even with two coats of my mascara on, my curled lashes held on its own and lasted me throughout the day! I am in love with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised when I received an email from Janine (costumer service) asking whether or not the curler was working fine and if I needed extra cushion pads. I already had ten extras, so I didn&#x27;t need any, but the fact that this company personally emails you to check to see how their product is working for you is so different, yet great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up purchasing another one to give as a gift to a friend! :)</li>
    <li> I really like this curler and it has worked well for me, but all my curler pads have split in the middle because of the sharp edge and constant pressure. The clasp for travel also fell off and so it makes it sort of bulky in my makeup bag now. I wish they sold just the replacement pads so I could continue using this. Everything else is awesome though. My eyelashes really do stay curled for the whole day now, and i don&#x27;t even have to put mascara on to hold the curl if I am wanting a more natural look. The hot pink is just an amazing plus. The pop of color really differentiates this product from others.</li>
    <li> This arrived on my doorstep about 15 minutes ago. I was excited to try this eyelash curler, but I wasn&#x27;t holding my breath that it would be anything special. After all, a curler is a curler, right? They all pretty much look alike and do the same thing. Wrong. Nothing I have used before compares to this. I used to try and try and try to curl my tiny straight little eyelashes and they would just not curl. They wouldn&#x27;t even bend. I usually just pinch the crap out of my eyelids. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eyelash curlers, so I thought it was just me. I was wrong. This curled my eyelashes beautifully. And to my surprise, I actually do have eyelashes! Who knew?! I&#x27;m in love with the Whip Lash curler! Oh, and as a bonus, I did not pinch my eyelids!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try to post before and after pics. Seeing is believing.</li>
    <li> I topically use the basic lash Curler you can find in any drug store, nothing special, just the plain metal ones. I have this one a try, the pink handle is cute, i love that you can lock the handle when you are not using it. As for the results on the lashes, it works about the same as the basic curlers, but i can get closer to my lashes with less pinching on the lid. That allows me to hold the curler longer, resulting in a better lash curl. Having the extra lash cushions are a nice bonus as most curlers tend to leave a crease in the cushion over time. This one will last you a long time, I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Loved it! Great packaging and works well. Got it on the review deal and very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Did not help curl my lashes at all. Very disappointed with this product, I guess I&#x27;m going back to my elf eyelash curler</li>
    <li> Adorable packaging! Great curler! Comes with replacement cushions that may or may not fit, but company is gladly replacing the cushions if you happen to get defective ones. Love this curler! *sample provided*</li>
    <li> Does pull my eyelashes and is really hard to close down on when squeezed</li>
    <li> Love the lash curler and love the Crave Naturals customer service.  After a few months, the handle on my first eyelash curler broke, I emailed Crave Naturals and expected them to say, &amp;#34;sorry, the return time has passed&amp;#34; but to my surprise, they said, &amp;#34;no problem!, we have a lifetime guarantee on our products!&amp;#34; I received a replacement within a three days.  The customer service is over the top! Oh, and they didn&#x27;t make me send the old eyelash curler back to them either, I attached a picture when I sent them the email about it breaking.  No hassle for the customer, so very rare.</li>
    <li> Great curler!! Came with more than 10 refills. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I gave 4 stars....it comes with 10 refill pads which is so nice.  After my first use it was so easy and my lashes curled very nicely.  It was easy to use and no pinching...I recommend this curler...I have almond shaped eyes and this curler grabbed each lash.  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I really like the product and definitely gets the job done.  My lashes curl nicely and not after too many tries.  One minor thing to mention, the rubber doesn&#x27;t seem to stay in place.  You have to adjust it after every squeeze.  Overall happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Most comfortable-to-use eyelash curled I&#x27;ve ever owned! Creates a great curl, comes with many more refill pads than any other curler I have ever bought and it&#x27;s easy to keep clean. Love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these by accident, and it&#x27;s a good thing that I did-- not because i love it, but because the each of the pads split within 2 weeks of use--if I didn&#x27;t have the extra pads from my accidental second curler, the curlers would be useless by now.  When the curler first arrived it was clamped shut and had already made a deep groove in the pad. That first pad split within the first week of use.  I stopped clamping the curler shut with it&#x27;s little locking bar, but the pads still split very quickly.  This curler curls nicely, but you might as well save your money and buy an e.l.f. Eyelash curler... Those pads split quickly as well (after about one to two weeks) but they only cost $1 for a brand new curler. My Japonesque curler that I purchased in December still works great and is still using it&#x27;s first pad.  If the time comes that I need a new curler, I will be repurchasing the Japonesque curler.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler gives your lashes a beautiful curl!! I have bought many eyelash curlers in my lifetime and this one is just simply superior and so pretty!! Great quality! Love the hot pink color and packaging!! I was pleasantly surprised by the extra refills provided. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> After using for 7 months the clamp broke. I want a replacement!</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the BEST eyelash curler I have had in my 40+ years of using eyelash curlers, and I&#x27;ve had many!  My eyelashes stay curled all day long too.  It is so good that I going to get one for my travel bag and my purse too.  Also, Crave Naturals is an incredible example of great customer service.</li>
    <li> I originally gave this product a 1 star review because my curler came with the wrong pads and they kept falling out, I was so disappointed! However, Crave Naturals handled the whole situation so professionally and quick they will have my business forever. First of all they proactively reached out and said that I might have received a defective product (they were right!), then they refunded me and shipped a new curler out the next day - great customer service!    My new curler is awesome. It&#x27;s sturdy and gives my lashes a great curl. I also like how you can \\&quot;lock\\&quot; the wand for when you&#x27;re traveling.</li>
    <li> While this curler does a great job of creating incredibly curled lashed, with time I found that it was pulling my eyelashes out to the point of having noticeable gaps in my eyelashes that lasted for months. Before I realized this, I had ordered a second one after the first broke. I have since switched curlers and my eyelashes are finally full again. I doubt everyone will have this problem, and admittedly I curl my lashes more frequently than most, but I felt it was worth posting as a cautionary measure to those of you considering buying this curler.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. She says: This eyelash curler does work really well and I&#x27;ve enjoyed it. Have I noticed an unbelievable change in how my lashes look when I curl them with this? Not really. Does the curl last all day? About the same as any other lash curler. Was it worth the price? Yeah, probably. It does come with a lot of replacement pads, which is nice. Part of the reason I bought this was because my other lash curlers were running through those pads too quickly, and every time I went to replace them, the store was out. I was hoping that the replacement pads on this lash curler would last a little longer, but sadly, there is already a noticeable dent in the pad and I&#x27;ve only had the curler a few weeks. It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m pressing harder than expected on it, since I want to actually keep my lashes and all, but it is a bit frustrating to see that I&#x27;ll probably be using a new lash pad every few weeks or more. Still, it&#x27;s a cute design and works like it&#x27;s supposed to. Plus it came super fast.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Curls great, but the inserts wouldn&#x27;t stay I&#x27;m.  I had to super glue them in</li>
    <li> If you have straight lashes and curls don&#x27;t stay even with a mascara, this is a really nice product for you. No need to squeeze it hard thanks to its smart design. However, this curler pulls out A LOT OF LASHES every time. For some reason there&#x27;s a gap in the middle of the refill pad and my lashes get caught there. I switched the pad with Anna Sui refill pads, and it is perfect now.</li>
    <li> For my full review click the link below!&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;EZRJBTwuj9A&amp;feature&#x3D;youtu.be</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t care for this eyelash curler.  It ripped out a few of my eyelashes everytime I used it.  I went back to my Maybelline curler.</li>
    <li> The pad on this curler is terrible and must be replaced after a few uses. If you happen to use the curler when the pad is worn out, it will pull out your eyelashes! Even though the curler comes with a lot of replacement pads, I ran out in about 3 months. The curler itself is good, although not anything special. I definitely will not be repurchasing this product.</li>
    <li> Works well comes with a lot of extra rubber cushions. I wonder what I will do when I run out?</li>
    <li> Great eyelash curler!  Not only is it pretty, but it works so well and curls every lash!  No pinching or lost eyelashes!  Great follow-up customer service!  I&#x27;d recommend this eyelash curler to anyone!</li>
    <li> I bought the Crave Naturals paddle brush, not the above eyelash curler...haha! Love the brush though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a couple of Craves products and I really love the brush and cuticle trimmer! While following their Instagram page I was able to get a discount code to try the eye lash curler in exchange for trying out the product. First off it arrived quickly and I anxiously opened the box. The packaging is super cute and the eye lash curler is awesome! It comes with 10 replacement pads which will give me a lot of use! I&#x27;ve been using it and it curls my lashes really well. I hold mine for 10 secs and they curl nicely. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with pinching or pulling of eye lashes. Overall I really like this curler and like my other purchases they provided me a code for a discount off my next Crave product! I can&#x27;t wait to see what else they have!</li>
    <li> I love this curler and have had it since May. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is one of the finger grips broke about a month ago. I can still use the curler but it still sucks that the handle broke. I was really happy with it and I was hoping that it would last longer. Actually the cgeap ones lasted longer but definitely don&#x27;t curl your lashes as well. I&#x27;ll keep using it till something else happens or get tired of it being broken.</li>
    <li> Love this curler! The softness of the pads is very lash-friendly and the curler applies just the right amount of pressure for an expert curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whip Lash&#x27;s customer service regarding this curler was great. The wrong size pads were sent the first time and the company immediately corrected the problem and sent me new ones. Personal messages were sent regarding the mistake and to make sure I received and was happy with the new replacement pads. Thank you, Whip Lash!</li>
    <li> Best brush ever! My 9  year old daughter has fought me brushing her hair for as long as she had hair.  I can&#x27;t thank you enough for this miracle brush.</li>
    <li> I had really never used or wanted to use an eyelash curler, but when offered this as a review I was intrigued. I thought it to be very easy to use, for a novice. I liked the fact that it didnt crimp or snag my eyelashes which was a concern to me. I felt the handle provided enough stability to hold and attempt the curling. I was impressed at the slight curl or more definite look.I didnt seem to have any issues with the pads I thought they fit well and were easy to establish for use, I do not understand all the negative reviews. The box they come in is recyclable and liked the idea of a closure attached so I could throw in my bag and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I did receive this product for review purposes and all opinions are 100% my own. Further compensation was not offered.**</li>
    <li> Love this product! It was shipped super fast and when I used it for the first time I notice how much easier it curled my lashes and without catching or pulling any out like my old curler does. The latch at the end of the handle improves the grip and makes it easier to press down for extra curly eyelashes. The handles also latch together, which is nice for traveling as I now have now worries about arriving to my destination with a broken eyelash curler!</li>
    <li> Good product; excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> Great product that works very well for my needs. Thank you for offering a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I tried this and had to return this because it pinched and it hurt. Hopefully it will work better for others. The aftermath was good but wasn&#x27;t going to be in pain every morning.</li>
    <li> Love this eyelash curler its gets every lash curled perfectly.. Add mascara to make them more dramatic</li>
    <li> Not a fan, no different than any other crimping curler. I prefer heated curler, less damaging to lashes.</li>
    <li> Pretty! I opened the box and the bright pink color stood out!. When i picked them up they felt like they were made so well. There is also so many extra pads, i will be set for awhile!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had an eyelash curler before and was really excited about giving this one a try.. I was so thankful for the easy to follow directions that came in the box.  I read some of the reviews before i got it and i have to say this product does live up to its reputation!.&lt;br /&gt;I have been expanding my beauty items and have been trying out new things. These are so easy to use and made my eye lashes look super cute!&lt;br /&gt;Overall. I am SUPER impressed with how great these eyelash curlers work and  I would highly recommend these eyelash curlers to anyone! Although the curler was sent to me for free for review purposes</li>
    <li> UPDATED---2015 I was contacted by the company informing me of a &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; design and they offered me a replacement to try. I appreciate the customer service; however am completely dumbfounded after receiving the new curler. This one literally turns my lashes UPSIDE DOWN, upon clamping they turn straight down completely defeating the purpose of a curler. Second, the replacement pads STILL DONT FIT (see photo). My question to the company is did you even try this on yourselves prior to launch of a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; design??? The last one was meh, this one however is so much worse and not even functional. You really missed the mark here.     I was expecting something great.........but it is a cheap curler disguised in a super cute box. The pads were a bonus, but I was in the group that got sent the incorrect replacement pads so they are useless. This curler literally did nothing more than a $2 drugstore curler for my lashes. It also pinched and pulled my lashes! Into the tool graveyard it goes.......</li>
    <li> The below review was an unfortunate mishap, and I still have faith in their product due to their service. The curler worked very well until it broke. The customer care was fabulous, and if you would like more details you can refer to my reply to the company and to this review. I originally gave it one star because of the below scenario, but they more than made up for it by their professionalism. Not every product is going to be put together perfectly, and I should have considered that before leaving my original review, and I should have also waited for an email response before reviewing with such venom. It&#x27;s difficult to make everyone a happy customer, but I believe this company bends over backwards to do that. Four stars because of the mishap, but if I could give the customer service more than 5 stars, I would.&lt;br /&gt;________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this eyelash curler in mid July 2014, and it lasted 6 weeks. It broke while I was curling my lashes, and the hardware scratched my cornea. The top part of the curler simply broke off, and I noticed that it was fitted together shoddily, and had some rust coloration (and no, I did not submerse it in water or expose it to moisture). I am pretty upset at this point; it&#x27;s not so much the $17 I paid for this product (as opposed to the $3 curler I used to have that lasted 10 years), but the danger it posed. Do yourself a favor and buy one at the drugstore, all you will end up with is a broken eyelash curler and a medical bill.</li>
    <li> I am sure this is great for women (or men) savvy enough to use eyelash curlers. I am just not one of those people. I was hoping this pink eyelash curler would cure me of my terror but alas I am still terrified of writing out all my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Love the brush really works...great scalp stimulator also...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Maybelline curlers for years.  I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase and switched curlers.  I don&#x27;t have issues with pinching my eyelids as I have experienced with other curlers. Also the curler does not smudge my liquid eyeliner.  They do the job well!!</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;m always searching for a great eyelash curler and I think this might be a winner. It&#x27;s got a really nice handle and doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to rip off my eyelashes. I love the little bottom handles it has for a more secure grip. It curls the eyelashes super quick and gives them a really nice, natural looking curl. If I need to curl them more, I&#x27;ll just give it a few pumps and voila! Awesome curler!</li>
    <li> I loved these eyelash curlers. My lashes are very short and the metal ones usually pinch my eyes. But whip lash has large pink pads that grab my lashes and curl them like I&#x27;ve never had another pair do.</li>
    <li> I can’t help how much I love these little contraptions that make my eyelashes look fuller, longer, my eyes look more open, awake and beautiful. I am not bragging about my eyes or anything but this eye lash curler does an outstanding job! And the packaging on this one is soo stinking adorable I didn&#x27;t want to take it out of the box!&lt;br /&gt;The no pinch design is easy to use. This is my favorite design for an eyelash curler, I usually do pinch myself with these, but not this one. It also carries a LIFETIME GUARANTEE! You are paying under 15 dollars for a product that you should NEVER have to replace. I would say that is a great investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is this hot pink, so are the replacement pads! It also fits all eye shapes, and has an ergonomically designed handle that will make sure your lashes are not crooked when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a latch that will keep the curler closed, making it easier to throw into my makeup bag for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review</li>
    <li> This is another great product from Crave naturals. I am becoming a huge fan of this line. The packaging is cute and protects the products during shipping. The eyelash curler is pink and comes with plenty of new cushion pads which is great because most eyelash curlers only come with one extra cushion pad. The extra cushions are important you change them as needed and it helps keep the eyelash curler clean and working great. Keep in mind it is important to keep eyelash curlers clean to avoid painful eye infections and to avoid getting your lashes stuck which can lead to them ripping out when you try to curl them. To help keep these clean only use them on clean lashes do not use them on top of mascara. The handle allows you to keep full control of the eyelash curler when you are using it. You are able to get close to the eyelash roots and press down without pinching your eyelids. I pressed in on the handles and held for about 10 seconds then repeated once more to get a dramatic curl. It gave my lashes a good lift and curl without ripping out any lashes, like some other curlers I have used in the past. I like these curlers, they work great and they will last you along time with all the extra cushion pads you get with them. I definitely recommend these eyelash curlers I did get them free to review but this does not influence my opinion on the product at all.</li>
    <li> I used this curler the whole summer whilst on vacation and I have to say I love it! It came with replacement pads in a little baggie, so all I had to do was toss the bag in my makeup kit and forget about it, no tucking them into a pocket and having them get dirty before I had the chance to use them. Love the little lock to keep the handles together so it takes up less space in your makeup bag too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because the moveable arm with the pad is a little crooked, and sometimes it pinches my lashes painfully. But if I go slow and don&#x27;t squeeze too hard, it&#x27;s not much of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I currently use a drug store eye lash curler, so for this review, I will be comparing this one by Crave Naturals to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is cute, girly, and overall very fun. I really do like it! The curler itself comes with a pink pad, pink handles and a bag with quite a few refill pads as well. Way more than what I have ever received with any other curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this was easy, fit my eye nicely. I didn&#x27;t experience any pinching or discomfort while using this one. After one use, and applying mascara, my lashes looked fantastic. A drastic difference between this one by Crave Naturals and my old drug store one. My lashes had a lot more length, were fanned out to look much fuller, and just looked amazing. You would have almost thought that I was wearing false lashes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about a week or so, and I am loving it. I have had no issues at all. Amazing results every time I use it. I think this one will be replacing my old drug store one for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes seem to fall out all the time so I never thought about investing in an eyelash curler. I was always curious to see if it would work for me. I finally decided to try one out for the first time ever. The creative concepts of this company are phenomenal and you can see displayed on this products packaging. Two things I loved about this product are the pink finger grips and the pink padding. I was so happy to get a generous amount of replacement pads with this product. The product is made of good quality and can easily be stored. I loved how easy this product was to use. I especially loved that it does not pinch your eyes and it is very precise. This product is great for beginners and veterans alike. I was happy to have added this to my beauty tools and recommend others should as well.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing curler!  I would recommend it to others. I bought two, one for myself and daughter for Christmas present.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE That it has replacement tips, hate it when they get all gummed up and have to try to either clean or get rid of to buy a new one. THIS one I won&#x27;t have to do that. Just dispose of the old gunky ones and put on fresh new pads. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> AMAZING brush.  I have long fine and VERY curly hair.  I&#x27;ve used picks for years because after getting a brush through these locks my curls turn to frizz.  At 58 I&#x27;ve finally found a brush that goes through my hair with ease, wet or dry.  I think it would work great on all kinds of hair.  A few of these are on my stocking stuffer list this year for sure!</li>
    <li> Not the best, but works ok.</li>
    <li> Makes lashes fuller and gives super curl that last all day long. No pinching. Very comfortable. I&#x27;ve never even had one that compares to the whiplash works.</li>
    <li> Gives a dramatic curve--seems to find length that other curlers miss.  Comfortable to use, too.  I like it better that any other curler I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve tried several expensive ones.</li>
    <li> I received a free eye lash curler from Crave Naturals, and first off, I have to admit that the packaging is pretty cool looking! Second off, this eyelash curler has a close adjustment which is built in, so no more having to run around looking for a small plastic closure that you might or might not have anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really loved this eyelash curler. I felt like it curled my lashes very well, and the sides didn&#x27;t pinch the skin around my eyes, which is always a bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also gave me 10 extra curler pads, which is good for me, because I feel like after a while the pads seem to lose their elasticity, and it&#x27;s always good to have extras around in case you want to change it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would give this product a 5 out of 5 stars, because it&#x27;s a pretty cool looking product, and it gets the job done, without all the hassle of other eyelash curlers!</li>
    <li> The usual pinching was expected, but the right upper edge was sharp It scratched my eyelid. Took a metal file and filed it until it was smooth. It&#x27;s okay now, but for the amount I paid for it I thought I shouldn&#x27;t have to do something to make it smooth.&lt;br /&gt;The pink pads are holding up, although I see a little crack in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;I would curl my lashes in the morning and they would last me 8 hours.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the performance of the Whiplash Pink Eyelash Curler By Crave Naturals.  Safely, comfortably curls lashes without any undue tugging, pinching, or pulling.  My eyelashes stayed curled for several hours -- very good!&lt;br /&gt;Handle is ergonomically designed for ease of use.  Soft rubber cushioned pads are easily replaceable.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have extremely sparse, hard to curl lashes and this curler curls them beautifully. I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love it my favorite eye lash curler by far! The packaging is super cute and the pink eyelash curler is great all around</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work with my eyes. They pinch in every way I try to position them. May be just my eye shape. The curler itself is well made and sturdy.</li>
    <li> This curler is so cute and works as well as any other curler. HOWEVER, the main differentiation is the company. Crave Naturals provides fantastic customer service. After about 9 months, I had an issue with the curler. I emailed the company and within a week, I had a brand new curler and was refunded my original purchase price. I will definitely purchase from Crave again, if not solely for their great service. Thank you!</li>
    <li> A pretty easy and comfortable lash curler to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Does not curl eyelash as expected.</li>
    <li> well, at first I received a damaged curler. The pads did not fit, and were just &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;. also, the eyelash curler itself- the metal parts, were warped so they did not close properly. dumb luck I figured. so I was refunded and a replacement was sent out, so I was happy at that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then the replacement came. looked legit. seemed to open and close fine. albeit it&#x27;s different than most. you don&#x27;t need to squeeze as hard.. almost not at all. so I curled my eyelashes..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did one eye. it was still a very tight, small barrel curl.. but I follow up with my metal Revlon curler, and it ends up being a very nice, large curl. it did pinch my eyelids pretty badly though.  but don&#x27;t they all sometimes?  I just figured I had to get used to it.  then I did the other..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;squeezed the life out of my eyelid. at first, it just hurt, but I didn&#x27;t think anything of it .. and certainly not that anything would come of it.  I finished my eyelashes, and went about my day. Nothing else different. Same make up, same everything.  about an hour later, I noticed that my eyelid was hurting. It reminded me of middle school when I used to share my make up. I would&#x27;ve sworn it was a stye. The day goes on, my eyelid gets a little more swollen, but still no stye. There was no bump whatsoever.  just the entire eyelid was swollen.  upon closer inspection, I could see a bunch of very tiny capillaries (super small veins) had burst, and I had obvious trauma to my eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to the next day.. today. my eyelid is still swollen, but I&#x27;m not going to over exaggerate and tell you that it looks super bad. You don&#x27;t notice unless I point it out. But yeah, this whiplash thingy really did some damage to my eye. I cannot even use it without pinching my eyelids. I don&#x27;t understand either. I hold it next to my Revlon one, and they look almost identical at the closing mechanism part, but somehow they are so different. The Revlon one never pinches me, but I cannot get this one to not pinch me. i&#x27;m just glad I did not pay for this. When my eyelid goes down, I may use it again, but if I cannot get it to stop pinching my eyelids, I will have to throw it away. and I&#x27;m no novice.. I was a professional model throughout my teens, had to go to charm school, trust me.. I know how to apply makeup and use an eyelash curler. but this is a torture device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bonus is all these extra pads for my other one :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here&#x27;s a picture of my lovely damaged lidt glad I did not pay for this.

    <li> Got it in the mail today.  Used it and i love it great product.</li>
    <li> the refill pads keep falling off when I curl my eye lashes- do not recommend.</li>
    <li> It does an okay job curling my lashes. but it might me different for each person</li>
    <li> Love!  After I couldn&#x27;t use my Shu Umera any longer I was in the hunt.  This doesn&#x27;t hurt or pinch and comes with a bunch of extra pads (at least 5).  For the price, it&#x27;s a home run!</li>
    <li> The Crave naturals pink eyelash curler has been great for me because I struggled to find a curler that was good for my eye shape. It is also pinch free which is a plus for me. I am also very happy there is a lifetime warranty. * I received one as part of a contest</li>
    <li> Love this eyelash curler.  I have short and straight eyelashes and this curler really curls them up for me.  No pinching either..</li>
    <li> this is a great basic eyelash curler and comes with multiple refills of the little pads (10!!!). it is more comfortable and less lsh pinching than most</li>
    <li> Really nice design. Handles well. Curls last in lashes.</li>
    <li> I really like this lash curler. It&#x27;s very easy to use and it really gets a nice curl on the lashes. There was a problem with the pads but the seller discovered this issue and fixed the problem without me even having to ask. The company and product is stellar.</li>
    <li> The girls in my home immediately loved this brush. It is not like anything they have ever had and they say it is a pleasure to use it.</li>
    <li> I am very picky about my eyelash curlers and have tried so many. This one is fantastic!!</li>
    <li> I have always used eyelash curlers and truly don&#x27;t see much of a difference between various brands, but what I will say about Crave Naturals that impressed me the most was their unbelievable customer service.  I was immediately notified that they had a few curlers that they were having an issue with the cushions not fitting properly and they sent me a package of new cushions in addition to the ones that came with the curler.  Then as a follow up they checked to see if I was happy with my curler.  I was having a bit of an issue with a piece that broke and without any hesitation they suggested that I discontinue use and sent me a brand new one.  This type of customer service comes rarely and for that reason alone I would recommend trying their product!!</li>
    <li> Great brush, my 6 year old daughter has super thick and curly hair so she was excited to try this.  Worked well.</li>
    <li> Both my girls begged for this brush.  We received it quickly and it works great for both or my children.  One has normal hair and the other has thick hair and this brush has definitely reduced tears while brushing hair.  Now my problem is I only have 1. Looks like I definitely need another</li>
    <li> The Crave Naturals Pink eyelash curler does not fit my eyes and cannot grab my eyelashes without pinching them.  Too curvy and short.  I use the rubber replacement for my Revlon curler and you can see it is shorter.  I don&#x27;t have a big eyes just normal size lol.  The Revlon eyelash curler fit my eyes better.</li>
    <li> This curler takes a little getting used to in order to position it correctly without pulling/pinching. But once you figure it out, it&#x27;s really great. I find if I look in the mirror with my head tilted slightly back so my eyelids are kind of half down as I look at myself and curl, it works really well. Make sure your eyelashes are really dry too. You really do get a super curl. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands and this is my new favorite. The best thing is the customer service. I had some concerns and they got back to me immediately, even offered me an instant refund if I didn&#x27;t like the curler; but I actually love it now. It also comes with a TON of replacement pads.</li>
    <li> I love the crave brush. I do use a leave in conditioner because it helps the crave with tangles plus it helps with styling aids.  I also heard using and old tee shirt instead of a towel will help with breakage. So far I like this is the only nrush i will use on my hair. I use to use only combs.</li>
    <li> I love this curler. I love that it locks for storage, and is the first one I&#x27;ve gotten good results from. The box is adorable, and 100% recyclable. Very happy with this purchase thus far!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter is a make up artist and always gets the best products...So when i told her i purchased this she was the first one to grab it. Well She loves it and so do her clients!! They both said it curls the lashes nicely and doesn&#x27;t pull at them. She also loves the handle , she loves that its comfortable and fits her fingers nicely. I was impressed with the 10 refills it comes with and the packaging is just amazing!! I can see many happy ladies if they had this product in their stockings this holiday season!! I am very happy with this purchase..great quality ..great value and its so pretty and Pink!!</li>
    <li> An eyelash curler is the one and only beauty product i can&#x27;t live without. I have owned several and this is my favorite thus far, it did come with extra cushions as advertised. when, and i say when not if, i lose this one i will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Shipping was very fast! Great product. I really like the packaging and that they give you so many replacement pads! 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love the curler.  Twice I was told that refills that &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; the curler had been mailed.  To date, I have not received any shipment.  So I have a bag of refills that just pop out.  The curler is great, but I don&#x27;t know where they are mailing the refills too.  I liked that the company followed up and asked me about the refills, now I just wish I could get them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an amazing brush.It detangles hair without breaking them from the root</li>
    <li> I love the brush so happy that I bought it.  It is perfect for my long hair.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It&#x27;s a great brush for massaging my scalp. It makes your hair very soft when you use it. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Not gonna lie - I was drawn to the packaging and the pink rubber lash guards. Luckily, this product isn&#x27;t just pretty looking, it&#x27;s also pretty fantastic eyelash curler. I have been using it everyday and it&#x27;s still perfect!</li>
    <li> Curls the lashes very well.</li>
    <li> Worked great until the rubber fell out and  the replacements never fit right.  It would pinch my eyes and didn&#x27;t work correctly.  I ended up throwing this out and just buying one from the drug store.  If the rubber would have stayed in the metal I probably would have loved the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product. Although it curls nicely the product is not durable.  The plastic is very low quality.  Only 2 months into using it and the handles completely cracked off.  The handles basically crumbled.  I tried putting it together by super gluing and it lasted for a few days before completely crumbling to the point that all that was left was the metal wear it was once attached.</li>
    <li> It broke within 3 months of purchase.  Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> The little pink lash pads keep falling out, especially after I squeeze my lashes. It&#x27;s bumming me out and slows me down.</li>
    <li> The handle broke off after two months of using this. It is not a reliable product. I did not drop it or anything and always treated it delicately but one day the pink fingerholders just completely fell off. I&#x27;m very unhappy about this!!</li>
    <li> My old eye lash curler would pinch and pull out some lashes. The Pink Whip Lash works like a dream. My lashes look better than they have in months. Shortly after it arrived, I got an e mail saying the pads may not fit properly. They didn&#x27;t and where replaced quickly and without question. There has been a follow up e mail to make sure everything is alright. That&#x27;s great customer service! So very pleased.</li>
    <li> Not impressed.  Have to squeeze preety hard and make several passes to get a good curl.  The company does stand by their guarantee and they seem to have very good customer service.</li>
    <li> The Whiplash Pink Eyelash Curler is a beauty product you&#x27;ll want to add to your collection. I&#x27;d never used one aside from this and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be switching. I&#x27;ve done my homework in the features you wants and the cons that commonly can be found in an eyelash curler and this one seems to have all the pros and and zero of the cons! If that&#x27;s not a top notch beauty product, I don&#x27;t know what is. Dramatic curled eyelashes without pain and little effort, yes please!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design from the curler itself to the trendy box design is quite appealing. The box has the Whiplash features, Instructions, and Proper Care Tips listed. Anything you&#x27;d possibly want to know is covered and if there&#x27;s something you want to know that&#x27;s not mentioned, there&#x27;s a card on the inside that list the companies email. On this card, you&#x27;ll find where to get connected with the company on-line and there&#x27;s also a 25% off coupon you can put toward any of the companies other products! I for one took advantage of this offer and picked up one of their great detangler brushes but that&#x27;s another review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eyelash curler has worked wonders on my lashes.  I found the ergonomic handle of the curler to fit comfortably in my hand when squeezing each of my eyelashes to achieve the curl. There were no lashes left uncurled and the shape was certainly noticeable and uniform especially after applying my favorite mascara. I had no pain or pinching and zero lost lashes! When this curler is not in use, I can easily use the closure latch to keep it tight and together to prevent unwanted damage to the product. This also means it can travel easily and take up minimal space! I also found it to be pretty light weight. Time will tell in how long it will keep but so far it&#x27;s not given me any issues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eyelash curler does require you to purchase replacement curler cushion pads. I&#x27;m sure how long these will last because it&#x27;s been over a month with many uses and the first pad I have is still going strong without any wear. Obviously when it does wear out I can easily take it out and replace it with one of the other 10 it comes with. If you feel you&#x27;d like to have more on hand, I noticed on the company website that they are offering 10 more pads for the cost of just shipping which is just $2.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an affordable and effective eyelash curler and if you aren&#x27;t happy with it the company will offer you money back. This a great substitution to using fake lashes which can be damaging to your eyes and can get pricey too. I like this product and stand fully behind it!till going strong without any wear.

    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what all the positive reviews are for. This curler is awful! First off, the pink pads fall out constantly (which must be why they include a baggy full of them). Also when you apply pressure to curl the lashes it actually slices open the pink pad which then gets filled with gunk and eyelashes. It was constantly crimping my lashes and pulling them out! I&#x27;m writing to the company for a refund now. I will stick with Tarte eyelash curlers from now on!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this eyelash curler :-( not worth the $$  The curler itself is not terrible (that is why I gave it 2 stars) but not the best either but what really annoys me is the fact that the rubber cushion keeps coming off &amp; keeps lifting not matter how much I try press it down! (just for that alone it deserves 0 stars) I already lost 3 of them :-( I&#x27;m returning it!! the best eyelash curler is SHU UEMURA EYELASH CURLER almost the same price but only comes with 1 xtra refill and that was the reason I gave this curler a try.  UPDATE!!!   9/15/15  I e-mailed them about the problem I was having and the same day I received a reply and a few days later I received the correct cushions &amp; now I&#x27;m in love with my curler it works perfect! This company has wonderful customer service!!</li>
    <li> I have very long and thick eyelashes and am always on the lookout for a better eyelash curler than the one I happen to be using at the moment. This is it. Super dramatic curl that stays put. Also, this company is SERIOUS about excellent customer service and stand behind their lifetime guarantee. If you ever have a problem, all you need to do is contact them and they will make it right.</li>
    <li> I never realized how bad my old eyelash curler was until i received this product. I had never used an eyelash curler without pinching my poor eyelash and with out a little bit of pain. Just figured it was part of the process no pain no gain type of things. With Whiplash eyelash curler i didn&#x27;t have this. It was a completely pain free experience and it even came with replacement pads. I also love the fact that its pink and cute. I have recommended this to all my friends and family I love this. I will be purchasing a new one once i run out of replacement pads.</li>
    <li> I liked this eyelash curler but found that the pink pads quickly sliced open and actually contributed to pulling out some of my lashes.</li>
    <li> Only okay.  Had to re-curl many times to get lashes to stay curled.</li>
    <li> Great product and great customer service! Have had other curlers and they made me a little nervous. This one is easy to use and curls beautifully. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> it really hurts to use. doesnt pinch per se but it is just very uncomfortable on your eyelids. If you can stand the pain it curls pretty well. Im not sold on it and I wouldn&#x27;t reccommend it to anyone. just stick with cheapie ones from the cvs or walgreens</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the high ratings. I learned after going through the first pad in only a week and having my eyelashes pulled out not to use the locking mechanism to keep the curlers shut. This caused pressure on the pad and created a tear in the middle. I did not use these everyday and so this pair I have had about 6 months when i went to use them this morning the handle crumbled in my hand. It seriously broken into 3 or 4 pieces! Thank goodness it wasn&#x27;t by my eye yet when it happened. Not sure what caused it, but between the cost and issues I have had those were my only purchase of this brand.</li>
    <li> works pretty good and seems to be made very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this curler based on the rave reviews.  I really wish I knew what the hype was all about.  This curler sucks.  Used it once...didn&#x27;t work.  Tried it out a few more times really hoping maybe I was doing something wrong, but nope, still doesn&#x27;t work.  Bought two of them and will be returning them both and buying the Cover Girl one which I found works better than this overpriced one.</li>
    <li> The best brush ever.  Now all my family use it.  I order 2 mores.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this eyelash curler only 6 months ago and the handle has already crumbled off. Also, the little rubber things are not very resilient; after just a few uses, the curler cuts into the rubber, which ends up pulling at one&#x27;s lashes. Horribly designed little beast of a pink monstrosity.</li>
    <li> At first I was SUPER impressed by this eyelash curler, it worked SO good!  But, after only having it a few months, something happened to the spring mechanism in it and it just does not curl like it did when I first got it.  I was really disappointed that that happened after only a short time of using it. It also seems that you have to change out the pink pads frequently (and sometimes they don&#x27;t like to stay in place). It still works better than my old one of a different brand, but just not like it did when first purchased.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyelash curler ever!  No pain and works perfectly every time! At first it might look like some weird contraption but it does a great job!  I took the advice of one of the other customers and heated it with a blowdryer first, it made the lashes curl better and it held the curl all day after putting mascara on.  I am Asian so my eyelashes stick right out but this contraption fixed that problem! Great little product!! Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Does the job nicely although the little latch is a thin wire and came off early on.  The company has excellent customer service and takes care of issues promptly.</li>
    <li> Worst curler ever. It even cut off some of lashes!!!</li>
    <li> I used to comb out handfulls of hair every day. I used a wide-tooth comb on my wet hair because it hurt the least and didn&#x27;t flatten my hair to my head like a brush did, just trapping the tangles under the top layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no tugging on knots with this brush. You don&#x27;t have to grab your hair away from your head and yank to get through tangles. Just run the brush over again, maybe at a different angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also my hair is incredibly soft and smooth after using this, and I seem to be losing less.</li>
    <li> These were so cute!!! They work wonderfully as well!! Curled my eye lashes just fine.</li>
    <li> I got these 2 days ago, the style is adorable! I love the bright pink. I especially love that you can lock them!! I&#x27;ve seen some people say the extra pads do not fit but I haven&#x27;t had any issue. So far so good!</li>
    <li> Love the Crave Naturals Whiplash Pink Eyelash Curler!  Eyelash Curlers usually pinch my eye lids but not this one!  It really gives a beautiful curl and doesn&#x27;t leave kinks in your eyelashes.  I highly recommend it to any girl!</li>
    <li> I love this curler! I&#x27;ve tried lots of others, including japonesque (which broke after a couple of months:() and I really like the way this one works!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different eyelash curlers. Up until recently, I have stood by a different brand. The pads weren&#x27;t any good any longer and I couldn&#x27;t buy just the pads so I shopped around for a new one. My old stand by went up in price with only including one extra set of pads. I found WHIPLASH quite by accident and love it. Yes, I know all eyelash curlers are basically the same but the selling point of this one was the clamp to keep it closed and FIVE sets of pads!! It does a great job with curling...minimal to no tug and pinch plus it comes with tips that work. Do not hesitate to purchase!</li>
    <li> Finally an eyelash curler that works all day! I love it! So happy I found it and just ordered one for my sister in law. I also purchased the detangling brush, which works great.Thanks for the good quality products.</li>
    <li> The replacements fit perfect. I like the fact you guys emailed me letting me know there was a problem on the refils</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. it fans out the eyelashes and also curls very nicely. Already arrived with extra pads.  So far it&#x27;s one of my favorite eyelash curlers  I would buy it again. Arrived quickly and emails checking to see if I received my purchase and if I like it.</li>
    <li> This is a great eyelash curler, love how it leaves them after everyuse. Doesn&#x27;t hurt or pull my lashes. I will recommend this for sure</li>
    <li> Terrible.  Not only do the pads come out of the curler constantly, the wire piece that keeps the curler closed popped off within the first week.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The brush feels good on my scalp. Helps to brush out wet hair and as your are blow drying. There are less stray hairs or none in the brush after use.</li>
    <li> The pink plastic handles broken/disintegrated after less than a month.</li>
    <li> Really good eye lashes Cutler works</li>
    <li> love these! curl eyelashes perfectly, makes them long and fluffy looking</li>
    <li> Great Curler. I love the latch to close it. I love the color. It works amazing and has so many replacement parts! I am very satisfied!</li>
    <li> This is definitely not designed for the shape of my eyes. Also the pad so too squishy. It pulled so eyelashes out!</li>
    <li> First the packaging is just Adorable, The Eyelash curler is easy to use and I really like the spring loaded feeling it has so when you are done it just pops right back open with ease. A latch/lock is there to keep your eyelash curler closed when not in use. I have been using it everyday even over my Lancome curler. I can&#x27;t forget to mention the Amazing Pink pad on there. There are also 5 additional replacement pads included. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts or opinions</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care what anyone has to say about this product, I have been on the search for an eye lash curler that will last throughout the day, this is by far the best eye lash curler that has created a nice big lash from my straight as arrow eye lashes that don&#x27;t fall flat half way throughout the day..... best $15 I&#x27;ve ever spent and the 20 extra pads is a HUGE bonus!!!!! I let my cousin try it out and she ordered her own because she was amazed at the big curl it created....</li>
    <li> I really liked this product, the packaging was really cute! The spring within the curler us a little tough and might just need to be broken in some. Great deal though!</li>
    <li> This is very comfortable for me to use and gives good results. Higher quality than I expected for the price.</li>
    <li> First if all its adorable and when I use it I can get so close to my lid without discomfort unlike drugstore brand curlers that hurt and damage my lashes. Just the right about of curl too it doesn&#x27;t look like I just bent my lashes. Lastly the band on the bottom is padded so it&#x27;s not so hard of a curl which is beautiful!</li>
    <li> I was using the Revlon eyelash curler, which was ok. I noticed the back of my lashes always got left out and I have to curl back and forward to curl everything. I kept thinking: There must be a better way!&lt;br /&gt;So I went online and searched for a better product. I came across this curler. I liked the cute package, the pink accent and the good reviews. So I ordered it. The first day I used it, I noticed it got all my lashes in one pinch, which is awesome! I usually heat up my curler with my blow dryer to enhance the curve, and it works very well. So far I am loving it.</li>
    <li> Very nice eyelash curler. It&#x27;s flatter than my usual one, so that I can get close to my eyelash roots. (I guess my eyes are flat haha). It comes with 10 replacement rubber cushions which I think is awesome. There is also this tiny metal thing to close the curler shut when you want to travel with it. This helps to not damage the curler and cushion. The pink finger holes are plastic, which are okay, but they do their job. I prefer rubber for more comfort but I&#x27;m just being picky.</li>
    <li> One of my fav lash curler and its PINK a girls best friend</li>
    <li> Easy to use, nice spring compared to the one I was using prior. I love that it comes with 10 refills!! Normally you get 2 from the store. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Cute packaging! Good quality!</li>
    <li> CHOPPED OFF, IT REALLY CHOPPED OFF MY EYELASHES!  DO NOT BUY THIS!!</li>
    <li> I use mine everyday and love it. Curls my eyelashes perfectly!</li>
    <li> So far I am impressed with this curler. It really doesn&#x27;t pinch. I have super short lashes too being Filipino (Asian). This curler paired with really good mascara can replace fake lashes! It gives a nice curl too; no dents!</li>
    <li> I have long eyelashes that have been thought to be fake eyelashes with mascara, and I have been curling my eyelases since I was 14, and now I am almost 70 and this is the best eyelash curler I have ever used! It doesn&#x27;t pinch. I don&#x27;t know how they do it but it doesn&#x27;t! I also like the plastic handle that is comfortable for your fingers.</li>
    <li> I really like this eyelash curler it does not hurt at all..</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the best eyelash curler I have ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t cause my lashes to crimp all weird and it never pinches me.  It feels more solid than curlers that I have paid twice the price for, and the coated handles make it very comfortable in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company that sells these has surprised me with better customer service than I have ever received.  They contacted me immidiaty after I bought this product and they offered to send me extra pads for the curler.  The pads that came with the curler worked fine, but the extra ones they sent me were slightly better so it was great to have both.  If you are hesitating on this over a concern about the pads, don&#x27;t.  This curler is awesome.</li>
    <li> This beast is amazing! love love LOVE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using the same one, 3 years later!!! Still in love!</li>
    <li> got this for my mom, who is a little &#x27;challenged&#x27; by some beauty tools...she found it very easy to use, and the packaging is so cute! shipping was very quick. this was definitely cheaper than my old shu uemura curler and I can&#x27;t tell any difference.</li>
    <li> Easy to use!  I bought this for my 13 year old daughter, and she&#x27;s loving it!  It works very well and gives a nice curl to her lashes.</li>
    <li> BEST LASH CURLER EVEEEEER</li>
    <li> As much as I hate to admit it, I&#x27;ve been using an eyelash curler for 49 years.........so I feel I am more than qualified to comment on the Pink Eyelash Curler - Whip Lash.  From Maybelline to the $20.00  Shu Uemura eyelash curler and everything in between, I&#x27;ve used them all.  I still can&#x27;t believe I paid $20.00 for the Shu Uemura curler but that goes to show you how much I value an eyelash curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curve of this eyelash curler isn&#x27;t as pronounced as others I&#x27;ve had, which means the outer corner of your eyelashes aren&#x27;t over crimped.  This has always been a problem for me.  With the Whip Lash, I&#x27;m able to get right to the lash line and with a few pumps, curl the entire lash and the curl looks natural.  It is advertised as &amp;#34;pinch free&amp;#34; and believe me, it is pinch free!  Now I don&#x27;t know what makes it pinch free, but geez, I HATE IT WHEN THAT HAPPENS!  I only know that I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks and have yet to pinch an eyelid.  Yeah!  The quality of this curler seems very good and I like the locking device that keeps the unit closed for travel or if you&#x27;re like me - it makes it easier to stand it up in my brush holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller is excellent, providing good communication and usage tips.  PLUS - a dozen replacement curler pads were included FREE!  What more can you ask for?  Could the Whip Lash Eyelash Curler be the Holy Grail of curlers and the end my quest for the  perfect one?  I think so!</li>
    <li> I used this Curler for the first time today and my lashes stayed curled all day. It is easy to use and it has a great grip to it. It is easy on the lashes and absolutely no pinching of the eyelids. And it also came with refill pads.  I highly recommend this effective product.</li>
    <li> Definitely no pinch.  How they do it I don&#x27;t know.  But, the curl factor is lacking.  The pink rubber part lasted a very short time, but they realized the defect and sent me new ones in black, which are much better.  But, sorry to say, pinch or no pinch, it doesn&#x27;t curl like the Shu Uemura or the Shiseido.  What I do is get my eyelashes started on the upward swing with the Whip Lash since I find that the initial step is the pinching step.  Then I finish it off with the Shiseido.</li>
    <li> Works great and comes with many extra black rubber things to replace</li>
    <li> Perfect curler to use on mascara free lashes.</li>
    <li> I love the spring to help crimp my lashes. Definitely a no pinch curler.  Lots of refill pads.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the good reviews but it did not work as expected.  I have purchased cheaper eyelash curlers that have worked better.  The curler doesn&#x27;t curl very well and my lashes often get stuck when using this product.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this curler! Comfortable to hold, easy to use, and gives my lashes the extra boost I was looking for!!</li>
    <li> I needed a new eyelash curler and this deal came in just in time! I love it!! It doesn&#x27;t pull lashes, nor does it leave a crimp (you know, that sharp angle in your lashes like some curlers do). Makes lashes beautiful!</li>
    <li> So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this curler in hopes I wouldn&#x27;t have to throw out another revlon one this year. It looked promising, even with the mixed reviews.  So far, it does curl my lashes better and easier with comfort. It takes little force to achieve the curl and I like that about it.&lt;br /&gt;But, the pad that came on it comes up on one side, like it doesn&#x27;t fit correctly in the curved space. It doesn&#x27;t affect how it works, other than I stick it back in when it comes up.  With that being said, the seller did send me an email saying they have addressed the replacement pad issue that some reviewers on here have mentioned. I have not used a replacement, so I can&#x27;t speak on that end. They seem to care about the product and customers happiness with it. That means they will likely listen to the things that may not be working correctly and aim to replace and perfect them. That&#x27;s a good thing, especially for a 15 dollar eye lash curler. It&#x27;s an investment, but so far so good. I can&#x27;t give 5 Stars until I see how long this thing holds up. I will update in a year or so.</li>
    <li> Great and works just like advertised.</li>
    <li> Terrific eyelash curler.  And great customer service!  Getting an item that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and realizing it&#x27;s made by a company that actually cares what you think is a five star any day of the week for me 😀</li>
    <li> Worked well for awhile, but pink handle part broke off on one side...it doesn&#x27;t work the same after that.</li>
    <li> love it! I have used the curler without mascara and it looks like im wearing mascarra.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t love it!! I lost a a lot of eyelashes !!! And then the pink  curler will fall!! Not crazy about it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyelash curler for a couple of months now. It&#x27;s probably the best one I&#x27;ve ever had. Makes my lashes look great. Definitely giving these as gifts to my girlfriends.</li>
    <li> Obsessed with this product! I have naturally small eyelashes, but this curler made them look huge! If you clamp it down and sharpen the angle of the curler to your lashes, you&#x27;ll get great results! Love the fact that the product came with tons of replacement pads. Such a happy customer!</li>
    <li> This is the best!  I&#x27;m eurasian, so I have weird shaped eyes, which I&#x27;m assuming is why no eyelash curler I&#x27;ve found up to this point works on me.  They always pinch my lids!  This one though is the best!  No pinching, and AWESOME customer service!  I had an issue with a piece of the curler flying off, and then I lost it because it was in my gym locker room.  They are just replacing the whole curler for free!  Customer service like this makes me a customer for life...keep it up, Crave Naturals...I&#x27;m going to be buying like ALL your stuff now!</li>
    <li> In LOVE with this eye lash curler. I mean, how much more girly and cute can a cosmetic item get????? First of all, I love the BOX this comes in. I know, it is just the box, and provides nothing more than protection for the item, but it&#x27;s all comic-looking and adorable. You know that if that much thought was put into the box, whats inside must be amazing! The eye lash curler itself works flawlessly. I curl my lashes after I put on my eye shadow and before I put on my mascara, that way my curler does not get gross with mascara. I love the pink pads that this curler uses, as it gives it that little pop of color that just draws you in. Plus, with so many replacement pads, you know this will be a worthy investment. The pads are very plush too, and truly play a role in keeping your lids from getting pinched. I also find the little safety latch to be convenient too, especially when traveling. As a woman who wears make-up, and more specifically mascara, each and every day, I am confident when I say that I highly recommend the eyelash curler from Crave Naturals. I consider them to be of high quality, and created with care.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this eyelash curler.  She says that it works so much better than the others she has had.  Thanks for maming such a great product.</li>
    <li> I previously owned the E.L.F. Essentials Eyelash Curler and it did absolutely nothing for me besides painfully removing my eyelashes, I hated the thing. I was nervous about having the same experience with the Whiplash Eyelash Curler, but my worry was in vain. This curler is absolutely amazing and I highly recommend it to everyone!! My lashes are actually curled and they are all still in place! I love the little closure clasp, it makes it easier to store. I honestly cannot think of a single thing that I dislike, and that is saying a lot for me. I included a photo comparison between both curlers, I recommend enlarging the photo so that you can see the detail. : ]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several eyelash curlers, I have very light fine eyelashes.  Most eyelash curlers pinch but this works really well.  I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I love this curler.  I love the bright pink color.  The grip is great and it doesn&#x27;t slip out of my hands.  The curler mechanism really is pinch free. It comes with extra pieces for the curler mechanism too!  I also love how this company guarantees their product with a money back guarantee.</li>
    <li> Seems well made. My wife likes it and said it works good!</li>
    <li> It pulled my eyelashes out.</li>
    <li> I cannot even use this product, it&#x27;s a waste of money!  The pink eye lash curling pad does NOT stay put and falls out every time I open the curler to use it.  This product is terrible, not even usable.</li>
    <li> UPDATE to original,  the company contacted me and sent me one of their new curlers.  and I am back in love with it.  I had bought 4 different curlers when mine broke and all of them either pinched my lids or left me with no curl.  Anyway the new curler has a more rubberized less plastic handle that has now been going strong for almost 6 months.  and I love it,  in fact I got a new one for my mom and ordered one for my best friend for christmas,  I love that I get extra pads in my box (although I am still on the original pad) and I love this product,  the company listened to what people were saying and fixed it.  and they have my business for life on curlers,  only one I have ever used that actually works for me.  all the others have been donated because for me at least they just didn&#x27;t work!!  Between the fact that the curler really does work (note pump the handle for about 10 seconds,  don&#x27;t just squeeze) and my lashes stay curled all day,  and the customer service.  you can&#x27;t go wrong!!  It worked very well while it lasted. So I purchased one for my mom also.  But aftera couple months the pink handles on mom&#x27;s broke into about 20 pieces.  Mine did the same about a month later.  So while they do curl well the handles don&#x27;t last to make them worth while.</li>
    <li> Love them!!!!! WOW I ahve outSTANDing lashes!! The box is so cute. It came with 10 replace ment pads (amazing). I&#x27;m absoultely thrilled with this curler. Will be buying again for gifts!! Everyone I&#x27;ve seen today has complemented me. Huge self esteem boost!! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have in the past purchased brushes that CLAIMED to be detanglers but weren&#x27;t. This is the first one I am totally satisfied with. The lack of a long extended handle is even BETTER. I&#x27;ve had my share of brush handles that snap. The seller, as part of their follow up process of purchase, sealed me as a long term customer by adding advice on how to further keep hair healthy. Thank you so much for that kindness.</li>
    <li> I love the follow-up email with the tips on how to use the brush and maintain healthy hair.  Many thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very sad to report this didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  I must note that I LOVE the packaging &amp; design.  When I opened up the curler I found that the locking mechanism had caused the curler to cut into the curling pad that was already in the curler.  I was disappointed, but they provided a bag with a good handful of (I didn&#x27;t count... maybe 10?) replacement pads, so not a big deal.  I tried to put a new pad into the curler and the edges popped up.  I COULD NOT get it to stay down - I tried 3 different pads.  I even tried to blast the curler (while locked) with my blow dryer to help it along with a little heat... nope, then it was cut and STILL wouldn&#x27;t stay down.  I brought it up to my face with a new pad to attempt to curl my lashes (even with the edges coming up) and when I opened up the curler all the way the whole pad fell out.  I gave up and returned - I will be buying a different brand.  I never even got the chance to try &amp; curl my lashes with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Update (same day) **&lt;br /&gt;I just checked my email and now I see they proactively emailed me that there were faulty refill pads and they offered to send new ones.  Unfortunately I already put the curler in the mail to be returned and purchased a different brand eye lash curler.  I am impressed with their proactive response and I would have tried the replacement pads if I didn&#x27;t already return the curler.  Seeing their customer service I would not hesitate to order from this company again now that I see the level of support they put behind their products.  I am not changing my review because I&#x27;m not going to get to try the new pads.</li>
    <li> The curler is good I like how it leaves my eyelashes... However those 2 stars are because the gummy part doesn&#x27;t even last a week when you need a replacement</li>
    <li> couple of weeks ago i started losing my hair. no med change nor shampoo change. a lot of stress though. Dr gave me biotin. seems to be helping. kidney Dr gave me a pill called minoxidil. the stuff that&#x27;s in rogaine. that&#x27;s helping too. when i wake up in the morning one side of my head is knotty. i got the brush for that reason. everything is working out fine. i want my hair and nails to grow. cant wear the fake one i get a fungus. if you can tell me what else to do id be very happy.&lt;br /&gt;thank you&lt;br /&gt;lisa</li>
    <li> Spending $15 on an eyelash curler would make you think that you would have this thing for a decade.  Now, I&#x27;m not new to makeup or curling my eyelashes.  I don&#x27;t curl my eyelashes after applying mascara.  I know how to use an eyelash curler.  This is a waste of money.  It came with like 5 replacement pads and I have already been through 3 of them.  After using one pad for about a week the top part has made an indention that turns into a cut in the pad and starts pulling out my eyelashes.  I have never had an eyelash curler do this, and I am not like a super-strong body builder who constantly breaks eyelash curlers.  The first time I thought it was just a fluke, but when it kept happening I am assuming all the pads are defective.  What a waste.  I would not recommend this product.  I am going back to the one I got at Kroger for $2.    Update:  The manufacturer contacted me after this poor review.  New pads were sent to me free of charge. Thank you!    I still cannot recommend this product.  For $15 they should include new pads for all the defective curlers that are already in stock.  I wouldn&#x27;t take my chances with this product through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried to love this eyelash curler and hoped it would get better once broken in, but it&#x27;s really terrible.  After only a few uses I had switched back to my cheap drugstore curler, and this has been sitting in my makeup case for several months until I finally decided to throw it out today. The handles don&#x27;t even line up, so it&#x27;s awkward and off kilter while trying to operate it.  The point at which the parts move, the hinge I suppose it&#x27;d be called, pinches my cheek nearly every time.  The rubber pad against which the metal part curls eyelashes, has always caught my eyelashes which I then have to pull free, losing a few every time.  The little metal catch that is supposed to hold the curler shut between uses never worked, it slips right off immediately after securing it.  After a few uses, that little metal catch fell off the handles completely.  This would be the most expensive, yet poorest quality eyelash curler I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> I liked this curler. It didn&#x27;t hurt, and it curled my lashes well. However, my lashes did not stay curled for long, even when I applied some heat to it. I really liked the clip too, it makes carrying it easier.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to like it but I felt it pinch my eyelid on the lash line.  Ouch.  I had to be careful and think about it each time I pressed.  My old Shu Uemura eyelash curler never did that but it&#x27;s real hard to find this brand so I opted for Whiplash.  I&#x27;m thinking of returning it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to curl my straight down eyelashes like this before, even when using a high end curler from a well known national beauty chain.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is adorable (would make a cute gift) and the customer service is great.</li>
    <li> First of all you have to love this box! Shortly after receiving my curler for the review I was sent an email with some additional information which I will share with you but this is one of the things they mentioned:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I know that the box for Whiplash is very eye catching and tempting to keep, however it is 100% recyclable, so please recycle it instead of throwing it in the trash. If you want to keep it as a piece of art, we completely understand.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little note made me smile, because I am a huge fan of recycling! When a company has a likemindedness I tend to love them even more! I can also see the package framed and hung on the wall of someone really cool. Not my personal decor style, but I would think anyone who had this style to be pretty awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s talk about the eyelash curler though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all I love the latching mechanism, which can be removed if you have no need for it, but it is basically there for travel, to make your curler more compact. Otherwise it has no real purpose. Again this was noted in the email from the company:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;There is a closure latch on Whiplash to make it easier to travel with and put away in your makeup bag, however you don’t need to use the latch at all. It can actually be taken off, it’s up to you.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I plan to leave it on - I don&#x27;t travel often, but I can see it coming in handy if and when I get the chance to, and it is not in my way leaving it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pads for the curler come in both pink and black. I received black but if you run out, guess what ... you can order replacements for free, yes, free! You do pay around 2.00 for shipping however, but that is not a big deal at all considering they send you so many to begin with, and then tons of replacements when you re-order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a cool latching mechanism between the handles. Speaking of the handles, I love the way they are shaped, plenty of room for my rather thick fingers. Also there is this place to rest your middle finger which I find works well for having a more steady hand while curling your lashes. The spring mechanism is very springy, and sort of springs back gently so you don&#x27;t have to pull the curler apart. I hope that made sense. The curler overall is well made, durable, and built to last any torture I may be able to put it though. I am admittedly not the most delicate of creatures when it comes to my makeup tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I am loving about Whiplash is their helpful information they provide, above and behind the product. Such as tutorials, videos, and lists of information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product and I recommend it.r thick fingers.

    <li> LOVE. It&#x27;s the best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever used. I have always been the type of person that doesn&#x27;t like to spend too much on eyelash curlers because I thought they were all the same. I came across this one by chance and read the reviews so decided to give it a try (I really needed a new one). When I got it, the packaging of it is really cute (to me at least), it doesn&#x27;t pull your lashes and it does a great job making my lashes look pretty (mine are really straight and short). The buyer is also really awesome, I had problem with the fitting of the pads, I emailed them and I got response back shorty afterwards that they were sending me replacements at no additional cost! Definitely recommend, take this from a makeup addict. Definitely worth the price lol</li>
    <li> Bought this eyelash curler because of all the positive reviews. Really disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Eyelash curler gives me wonky lashes. I curl it exactly the same way as I did with my previous eyelash curler, and I got spider leg looking eyelashes, which is always nice, especially since I spent $14 on this curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Curl doesn&#x27;t last very long on my eyelashes. My last eyelash curler kept my lashes curled for a long longer than the Whiplast Curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is cute, and another reason why I bought this curler was because of the cute pink design, but I&#x27;m honestly really disappointed. I&#x27;m kicking myself for not keeping the box so I can get a return on this eyelash curler, so this is just a temporary curler until I can afford a new one...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;/</li>
    <li> This is the only eyelash curler I have ever used so I don&#x27;t know how to compare it to others.  It works, is very pretty and I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have gone through a lot of eye lash curlers and this is by far the best I have purchased. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> mine came slanted and it doesn&#x27;t actually curl my lashes, because it is uneven and won&#x27;t clamp down properly. super dissapointed. Also, it didn&#x27;t bring the refill pads as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many different brands and this one does fit my eye shape the best and has done the least damage to my lashes as it does not pinch my lashes out. I would recommend to others!</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash curler so much! This is the first one i have ever bought, and it gave me the results i was hoping for. Considering my lashes are short and straight, this eyelash curler really helped me out with making my eyelashes as good as they can without fakes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, not as good as I expected. Can&#x27;t get to the root of my eyelash.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve only had this curler a few days, but it is great!  it is tons better than my cheap-o drugstore one, and gives a long-lasting curl that is noticeable.</li>
    <li> Love love love the eye lash curler. It works great. Their customer service is top notch. I will be a returning customer for sure!</li>
    <li> I like this eyelash curler and it did prevent my eyelids from being pinched, thanks to their lash cushion.  The curler gave my lashes a natural curl in which I did not need to add mascara. I wouldn&#x27;t say my lashes were dramatically full, but gave my lashes a nice curl to make them appear a bit fuller. The curler has a good handle grip to prevent slippage. I love their cute packaging- it gives off a cute retro vibe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ProductReviewMom.com</li>
    <li> This is by far the best eyelash curler i have used over decades of use of other brands. It just curls it without prolonged periods of holding.</li>
    <li> I have always curled my lashes.  Since I have light colored lashes, mascara and and a good curl of my lashes is a must!  I&#x27;ve gone through tons of curlers that have pulled my lashes out, pinched my skin, and have broken with only a few uses.  I was super excited to give the Crave Naturals Whiplash Eyelash Curler a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I think the packaging itself is way cute.  It&#x27;s got a comic book look and is super enticing.  The box contained the curler, some directions, and a bag of extra cushions.  I really appreciated the bag of extra cushions because I cannot tell you how many times I&#x27;ve had to search and search to find those things with curlers I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Usually when you buy a curler it comes with maybe one extra pad.  So having so many right off the bat was awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed right away that the design of the curler was different than others I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s got an ergonomic handle for comfort and convenience and I really like the closure latch which helps it store really well.  Using the curler was great.  I did see that it did an excellent job at curling my lashes and making them look extra curled, long, and full!!  I do hold it down for a little bit longer just to ensure I get a great curl.  Once in a while it will pull out a lash or two, but it may be because I am holding it down so long.  But I am happy with the end result as I really like the long lash look it gives me.  Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great curler and am enjoying using it!</li>
    <li> Love it. Really does the job. Beautiful results. Hardly any sticking or pinching.  Now I know what the stars must use:))</li>
    <li> My last eyelash curler got tossed in the trash can because I got tired of it pinching me and sticking to and pulling out my eyelashes! Truth be told, I NEED an eyelash curler! My eyelashes just stick straight out and I don&#x27;t have a lot of them to begin with. So when I heard about the Whiplash Eyelash curler that claims to be pinch free, I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, while this is strictly superficial, I find the hot pink color flashy, fun and spunky! It makes me WANT to use it. So while that says nothing of the function, it definitely gives it some appeal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I noticed the ergonomic handle really makes a huge difference. It gives your ring finger a place to rest so it&#x27;s not just awkwardly hanging out there getting cramped while it waits for you to finish. It was hard for me not to cringe waiting for my upper brow to get pinched like my old one did but this one never pinches, even when right up against my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the true test! The actual curling part!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference is a lot more obvious once you put makeup on. My eyelashes really needed the help and it&#x27;s nice that I now have the Whiplash Eyelash curler to safe fully and painlessly give my lashes some spunk!</li>
    <li> I wanted to leave a glowing review because I actually really like the curler - it curls very nicely and is easy to use.  It just, sadly, broke today.  The handle is plastic and it snapped in half.  I&#x27;ve never used a curler with plastic handle before so I was sad to see I will only get 6 months use out of it.</li>
    <li> I did not want give 5 stars at first because I&#x27;ve heard of complaints with the replacement pads. However, the seller contacted me via email in regards to the problem and that if I experienced any that they would be replaced instantly, and that to me is very professional so thank you for that Crave Naturals- for that you deserve 5 stars :)  I needed an eyelash curler badly and this product arrived before the estimated delivery date- in two days to be exact ( thanks to prime), which I find amazing. The box is super cute, and I counted the pads to make sure there were truly 10 replacements and there was. The curler is pretty good, I used it as soon as I opened it to test it, and it really did curl my lashes. However, I had to do it at least 3 times to notice the difference, I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s my own fault since I&#x27;m scared to pull my skin in the process. Anyway so far so good :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Happy Customer</li>
    <li> Loving this curler! I bought it for my daughter who has STRAIGHT eyelashes.. This curls them beautifully!</li>
    <li> A great eyelash curler. So easy to use and I didnt pinch my skin. Handles are very comfortable. Thank you for the extra refills.</li>
    <li> Great brush!&lt;br /&gt;I got one for me and my teen daughter and we love them. This is the first brush that has really worked on my frizzy, constantly tangled hair. My daughter liked it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;A proven winner! :)</li>
    <li> love it! comes with tons of extra cushion refills - which I can&#x27;t imagine needing too much of anyway since you are only to use this on bare lashes (before mascara), excellent customer service - the company contacted me to ensure I was happy with the product, you don&#x27;t get that too much these days! :)</li>
    <li> This is an update...for the better!  Since purchasing this curler, I have been in touch with the company, and their care and attention deserves more than five stars!  They truly want to hear from you; your comments, concerns, etc.  I encourage you to try them out, you will not be disappointed.  The lash curler works very well with one condition.&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried it out, it did not curl and I was initially very disappointed.  I noticed that the cushion pad had a \\&quot;line\\&quot; in the middle due to the fact that it is shipped closed, that is, the handles have a closure latch that you can use to keep the handles close to each other.  I decided to change the pad with another one-one which did not have that line/imprint and tried it.  The results were so much better!!&lt;br /&gt;My best advise, DO NOT USE THE LATCH that closes the handles!!!  This creates that crease/line that prevents the lashes from getting curled; the lashes go into the crease.&lt;br /&gt;I have left the curler unlatched and it&#x27;s working great!  My eyelashes are very straight so the fact that it curls well is a big deal for me.  Leaving it unlatched doesn&#x27;t make a big deal at all; it doesn&#x27;t take that much extra space i.e. when traveling or storing.&lt;br /&gt;(For us girlie gals, the curler is so pretty in pink and though irrelevant to the product, the box is so cute.)&lt;br /&gt;Buy this curler; if you have comments/concerns contact them, you will get the nicest people!&lt;br /&gt;p.s. Though it says that it comes with five extra pads, mine came with ten!  yes!:D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a redhead with blonde, thin eyelashes that are reasonably long but difficult to see. Though I&#x27;ve stayed away from eyelash curlers previously, a friend who uses one suggested I should give it a shot so I decided to try this one. So far, I&#x27;m encouraged! No pinching or pulling, easy to use and delivers a great lift that also seems to make my lashes fuller. It&#x27;s been added to my daily routine!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this curler... I&#x27;ve only ever used one other brand before, and it was starting to fall apart. As someone with super straight but long eyelashes, I can&#x27;t fathom the idea of putting on mascara without curling my lashes. I&#x27;m happy I went with Whiplash for a few reasons: first, it comes with a ton of replacement pads; second, I am in love with the latch; third, it curls my eyelashes painlessly and well; and lastly, the customer service I&#x27;ve received since getting the eyelash curler has been outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> My old curler lost its spring, so I decided to try this one based on reviews. It works fantastically. The curl lasts all day and makes eyelashes look much longer. I didn&#x27;t know that eyelash curlers could work without pinching your eyelid. This curler is completely painless. Also, I have thicker, fuller eyelashes since this product doesn&#x27;t pull any eyelashes out. Ever. At all. (Which is a problem I had all the time with my last curler.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I didn&#x27;t get the extra refill pads that are supposed to be included. I haven&#x27;t needed one yet (I&#x27;ve had the product for a month or two), but they would still be nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I did have one scare... the latch at the bottom slipped into place while I was curling my eyelashes. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was wrong so I kept trying to force the pads to close over my eyelashes, and suddenly, the latch was squeezed out of its lock and the curler jolted forward and closed very suddenly. Could have gone badly, but I was fine. Just make sure that the latch doesn&#x27;t slide into its place while you&#x27;re using this.</li>
    <li> Who knew an eyelash curler was not suppose to pinch or pull?  This is a fabulous tool which transformed my stick straight lashes into beautiful fan lashes from the very 1st use.  I also used Maybelline Lash Sensational to get the full effect.  I am buying these for stocking stuffers and for all the females in my family who won&#x27;t believe their eyes are so gorgeous.</li>
    <li> I love this hairbrush. My daughter has wavy thick hair and brushing was always my most dreaded time with her. She has a sensitive scalp to boot! We tried the cushioned brushes and the cushion part would always pull away from the brush. This brush has the bristles built into the handle so there is nothing that can break. She actually looks forward to getting her hair brushes now!? Miracle !!</li>
    <li> Thank you so for making an incredible eyelash curler. It doesn&#x27;t pinch or chop your eyelashes off like the like the sally hansen eyecurler. Instead this little number makes your eyelash look amazing and it comes with tons of extra cushions refills.</li>
    <li> This lasted less than 9 months.  The plastic handle broke so... Unlike the cheap drugstore LaCrosse curler with metal handles, this one is now useless.  I saw no measurable difference in the type of curl either between this and my old LaCrosse curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED REVIEW 8/23/15 -- moved from 1 star to 3 stars... My first broke in under a year.  The company saw my review, contacted me and sent me a new one for free.  The new one does seem to have stronger handles (more of a hard rubber feel than plastic).  I&#x27;m not sure about the string to keep the handles closer together during storage, but I don&#x27;t usually bother with that anyway. They sent plenty of extra pads. Fingers crossed. I&#x27;ll move them to a 3 for now for AMAZING customer service. Thanks!</li>
    <li> ~~~0 STARS~~~ I cannot believe the 5 stars reviews on this eyelash curler. The cushion pads don&#x27;t stay in place, it pinches, it doesn&#x27;t expand your eyelashes just gives it a medium curl nothing special. Here comes the worst part..when I was curling my eyelashes the metal part from the side snaped out, poke my eye and ripped a good gap of my lashes!!!!! :&#x27;(</li>
    <li> I have now used this curler for about a week and am happy with the results. It did take some getting used to but now that I have gotten the hang of it I can definitely say it is the best eyelash curler I have ever used ( I am 44 ). I have used so many different curlers I cannot even count them. What makes this one stand apart from the others is ease of operation. You barely have to squeeze the handle and it is so comfortable. I have found that for me I get the best results by squeezing a little than releasing a few times and the curl is amazing. Could not be happier.</li>
    <li> My box was used.. It look like somebody ran it over and just shoved the product back in the box</li>
    <li> Underpromise and overdeliver seems to be Crave&#x27;s motto. I got my curler amazingly fast and opened the box to find not 3, not 5, but 13 pad replacements!  I imagined that they&#x27;re very good at customer service or someone is drunk at the packing plant until I got an email the next day that thanked me for my purchase, asked me to recycle the box (nice touch), explained that some people were complaining about the pads not fitting well (although so far so good for mine) and if that should happen to contact them immediately to get a replacement or full refund.  I was also emailed my certificate of purchase for reference in case I needed it (nice instead of a folded up piece of paper in a box).  AND I got a discount code for my next purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the curler, I&#x27;ve been using my trusty Japonesque curler until it broke and decided to try this one because I missed being able to heat up my curler.  Looking at the photo, I thought the base looked like it wouldn&#x27;t expand but it&#x27;s merely a handy lock that keeps the curler closed (nice for packing).  Unlock it and it expands nicely. The curler fits close to my lashline and does what it says.  Excellent curl and lasts long, especially if I heat it first.  I have sparse, flat, stubby lashes (curse you, menopause!) and this makes curler makes it look like I have sparse, curly, long lashes.  If it could only help me grow a few more lashes, it would be magic.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves everything about this eyelash curler.  I love that Crave Naturals is a customer focused company that exceeds expectations.  Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice eyelash curler. For the price, you get the curler and a package of refill pads. The pads are a rounded rubber, not foam, which is recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About curling...This does catch all my lashes, which my previous drugstore purchased one did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the refills...There are 10 refills included. You should replace the pad if it cracks to avoid lash breakage. Given that the rubber pads are not porous like foam pads, the 10 should last you a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sturdiness...The clasp mechanism is precarious. When I first opened the curler, it popped off, so you have to be a little bit careful opening and closing. However, it was easily popped back in. The latch is a nice to have feature for storage between uses since this curler is quite wide when it is opened.  Otherwise, the curler itself is sturdy and moves very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note on customer service...I was highly impressed that shortly after the curler arrived, I received an email from Crave Naturals informing me that the pads that the included replacement pads may be defective and fit improperly. I tried them out, and the ones I received did not fit properly. I let them know and received replacements within a week.</li>
    <li> Update... I bought this in July and the plastic handle has already broken.</li>
    <li> Been curling my eyelashes for 50 years.&lt;br /&gt;THE best curler I have ever used and I have tried them all!</li>
    <li> This is truly the BEST Eyelash Curler I have ever used. I have never gotten so much curl in my lashes with any other eyelash curler and I especially LOVE the refillables. This curler will last you A LOT longer than any other curler out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love this eyelash curler! It really is no pinch, and I have never felt so comfortable getting the curler right up to my eyes like the ones I&#x27;ve had in the past. I am using it everyday, which is a huge thing for me. Love Love Love!!!</li>
    <li> I love how the packaging is on this product as well as how it curls my lashes. They eyelash curler curls up so quickly and you get tons of replacement pads with it which is great.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend because she always complained that the drugstore yeah curlers didn&#x27;t work and it would cut off her eyelashes. This is a great product for the price! She loves it.. I&#x27;m a happy customer, no complaints. Would defenitily buy again!</li>
    <li> After a week of use, I still love it.  I love the lightness of it and how it is spring loaded open.  My pads are great but if you are worried based on other reviews- I received an email offering assistance before I even got the product!  Definite love and definite recommend!</li>
    <li> I had found my all time favorite eyelash curler from a high end brand, that I had been using for a few years. Unfortunately the spring in said high-end curler would snap regularly, causing me to replace it 3-4 times a year. No good. We had to break up :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched online for highly rated &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; eyelash curlers (seriously, I&#x27;m not sure what about the spring mechanism that makes them work better for me) and the Whiplash curler popped up in my google machine. I was optimistic and it was on sale, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I&#x27;m a sucker for packaging and the Whiplash curler sucked me right in. Not to mention ***5*** count &#x27;em FIVE replacement pads. This should be enough for the rest of my eyelash-curling life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curve of the curler fits my eye shape well, and the finger rests feel snug and easy to control. I like the idea of the little lock on the handle, but don&#x27;t know that I will use it...mainly due to the fact that I would often store my past spring-controlled curlers in a closed position, and feel like it puts undue stress on the spring, which may (or may not) cause it to potentially break sooner. With how many have broken on me in the past, I&#x27;m not going to chance it with this one. There also has been a time or two when I&#x27;m curling my lashes and the little bar pops over and locks while it&#x27;s still on my eye. No biggie, but I just make sure it&#x27;s flipped out of the way now when I start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also very pleased with Crave Naturals as a company and their dedication to customer satisfaction. They contacted me outside of Amazon to make sure I was happy with the product and didn&#x27;t have any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An all-around great purchase and experience so far! Thanks Crave Naturals!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome eyelash curler, but the pads wear out within within about only 2 days of use. I wish the pads lasted longer.  Even with the refills, this curler has only lasted me just over a month.  I will not buy it again and am going to start looking for something that will last longer.  Could have been great.</li>
    <li> updating the review from the previous one below. i received the replacement curler and i am one happy customer again! i have to say their customer service is amazing. love the curler even when it was broken and i love it even more now that it&#x27;s working properly. thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the handles and the clip thing is not sturdy and after just a month of using it, the plastic clip thing broke off. Right after that, the plastic handle broke off from the metal. believe me, i am not using it any other way, but just to curl my lashes once a day. i had my shu uemura curler for years and it never broke (till i lost it). and of course it&#x27;s post the date i am able to return/exchange - so i am stuck with it - using it very carefully not to lose the other handle. i wish i could post the pic of the curler - it&#x27;s ridiculous...</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Better than any brush I&#x27;ve ever used personally&amp;#34; says my boyfriend whom I bought it for.</li>
    <li> After reading wonderful reviews, I purchased this expecting to be amazed. I&#x27;m not. I did a side by side comparison with my Revlon curler to see which curled better. They were the same. I&#x27;ll stick to my $5 curler and will be returning this.</li>
    <li> I have read a few of the reviews on here and had to wonder if they read any of the instructions that came with this eyelash curler.  It clearly tells you to not curl with mascara on as it can pull your eyelashes - so, DON&#x27;T DO IT.  Simply curl BEFORE your mascara and then apply it.  If you follow these instructions, you will have beautiful, upturned eyelashes that will frame your eyes very nicely.  I like the locking mechanism on the handle that keeps it from being wonky in your makeup bag and keeps little people digging in your bag from easily breaking it thinking they are scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their customer service has been top notch and I even received a message letting me know that there may have been an issue with replacement pads and what to do if I had that issue (I didn&#x27;t - my box was perfect).  I love when a company proactively lets me know about potential concerns - it shows they are trustworthy and transparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in summary - follow the instructions, use it correctly and you will love how your lashes look!</li>
    <li> This is a great eyelash curler.  Four stars instead of five only because it takes some practice to not pinch yourself.  It&#x27;s sturdy and comes with several extra pads.  Most eyelash curlers only come with two...good purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been through so many eyelash curlers, and inevitably the rubber strip comes off, tears, or the shape just doesn&#x27;t work.  This one is the only one that is made in the proper shape so that I can get it close enough to the base of my eyelashes without pinching or missing half of the lashes.  This one is a keeper and I would definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Awesome, Great and Really Works!  How&#x27;s That? : )</li>
    <li> Its just an ordinary eyelash curler......nothing more.  I&#x27;m keeping it, but its not better than the drugstore ones.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t under stand why every one is raving about this. I&#x27;ve been using this for the past few times and it works and all, but I dont find it any different from using my typical revlon eyelash curler. The reason why i purchased this is because i have straight asian lashes that just won&#x27;t hold up especially when mascara is applied to it, so i thought this would do the job. However my lashes still slowly sinks down after i&#x27;ve curled and applied mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Another annoying part is that the curler pads do not stay intact with the tool, so I always have to push it back in before using it. I&#x27;ve already read review that there was a complaint about this, but mine doesn&#x27;t look defective it fits but it just doesn&#x27;t stay in between the metal holder !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end of all this I would just like to say that this curler does curl my lashes WITHOUT the mascara. However, I am able to accomplish this with my regular cheap eye lash curler. The only difference between the two is that this curler doesn&#x27;t require for you to press on the lashes and tilt the curler upward (for those who do not know how to curl your lashes correctly , this is what you would have to do. Once you tilt the curler upwards you give it second press to achieve the maximum results, but don&#x27;t do it with this curler because it will just pull out your lashes since it clinches on very close to the lash line). So nice curler but I am dissatisfied based off the fact that I believed it would solve my problems of straight asian lashes (with mascara applied after curling it)..</li>
    <li> This is awesome it curls without damaging and the curl holds all day</li>
    <li> Nice design, good quality,  fast shipping but I didn&#x27;t see a big difference compared to my other lash curlers.</li>
    <li> The best eye last curler I&#x27;ve ever owned (I&amp;#34;m 50). I&#x27;ve used so many over the yrs and often times felt like I wasn&#x27;t getting any benefit because the curl wouldn&#x27;t stay. This one does the trick every time and my lashes stay curled! The best one out there if you ask me!</li>
    <li> Great quality.  Perfect curl every time.  Will definitely re-purchase.</li>
    <li> The packaging is cute and the idea is good but the product just isn&#x27;t the best. The pads keep falling out unless you keep the curler locked closed. And if you do that, the top portion bites into the cushion, causing an indentation and pulling lashes. It&#x27;s no wonder they send you so many free re-fill pads, you need them to continually replace the lost and dented pads. The customer service was fantastic and they really try but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately after the first replacement, the bottom hinge broke and the replacement pads didn&#x27;t fit so I had to dig in my make up bag for the pink pads. Very disappointed :(</li>
    <li> It does a good job at curling my lashes and I don&#x27;t end up pinching my eyelids as so many other curlers do.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is awesome.  It is the perfect shape, sturdy, and curls lashes beautifully.  Love the pink too!  Crave Naturals customer service will exceed your expectations.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all.</li>
    <li> Love the eyelash curler.  Was looking for a new curler and came across this one.  When I received it I thought I was suppose to get 5 refills but only received 2.  Called the company and within two days received 10 refills.  I have never worked with such a wonderful company.  They follow up immediately with emails to make sure you are happy with their product.  They really care about their product.  It is such a pleasure to see a company give such wonderful customer service.  They really care about the consumer and their product.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I received the Crave Naturals Pink Eyelash Curler in the mail today and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. It arrived in a timely manner and in a well packaged box. It has 10 replacement pads included along with easy to fallow instructions( on back of box). The eyelash curler is light weight and has a great ergonomic design. It fits in your hand well, which in-turn gives you better control and manageability.It seems very sturdy and durable. It does not pinch or tear out my eyelashes. It gives great curl to your eyelashes in seconds. The spring mechanism design requires you to use a bit more pressure when curling your lashes but it makes the curl last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crave Naturals also has a lifetime guarantee. If for any reason you are not satisfied with your purchase they with refund or replace your whip lash curler hassle free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I really love the curler does a great job, love the color I also really love the box it came in. Definitely keeping the box.. Lol.. I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
    <li> Love it! Cute color, works much better than cheap drugstore brands. Well worth the money. Only caution- there is a hook to attach the handles together for ease of storage/travel...it CAN hook over the handle when curling! Would buy again, excellent service and product.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyelash curler I have ever used. It gives my very sparse eyelashes some much needed volume! The curler also comes with a lot of refill pads and they even offer to send you more for just the cost of shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I sent Crave Naturals an email and they responded within minutes. This is probably the best customer service that I have ever received from a company!</li>
    <li> The box is pretty dang cool and would make an inexpensive gift. First eyelash curler that doesn&#x27;t pinch. Works better than my lancombe curler. It starts down lower...definitely look longer. Besides all those refills that come with.... score!</li>
    <li> maybe I don&#x27;t have the hang of using this particular eyelash curler, although I&#x27;ve used many curlers before successfully.  This curler pinches the skin at the base of my lashes, and when I pull it a little farther away from my lid, then I get a bent (not curled) effect.  Also, my eyeliner rubs off on the top of the curler.  I can reapply, or put eyeliner on after, but overall, I find this curler to be somewhat difficult and uncomfortable to use.  I have gone back  to my old $6 Revlon eyelash curler!</li>
    <li> Used this curler for a few days, but it doesn&#x27;t curl my lashes.  It leaves them like you didn&#x27;t even use the eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> Beats Shishedo and Shu uemura. I have held on to the belief tfor too long that those are the best curlers.  I have been using this one about a week with the last of my mascara.  I am getting older and my lashes are not what they used to be.  Lately I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would ever find the right mascara to fix my thin flat lashes.  Well I got this and used with whatever I had (IT mascara, Laura Geller).  Liked the bounce of the curler, the grip is nice, goes across the whole lash line....  Didn&#x27;t really notice anything.  Well last night I came home after work AND going out to eat- 14 hour day and looked in the mirror from at minimum 3 feet away and I will be damned if my eyelashes were not like &amp;#34;wow-hello lady!&amp;#34;.  I did a double take.  So here I am writing my like 10th review ever on Amazon despite buying a trillion things on here.&lt;br /&gt;Nice customer service follow up although I am not a fan of companies contacting me on my personal email.  I will probably unsubscribe them after this review.  But I like to support start ups so I made an extra effort to let you know you should Buy it woman!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually a complete slacker about rating products, but my standout experience with this curler and with Crave Naturals has motivated me to give one.  I was very hesitant to purchase this curler because I kept thinking I could get one from the drugstore for 1/3 of the price.  I had been using a curler from Sephora that pinched my eyelid basically every morning, so I knew I needed to find something different.  I finally broke down and purchased this one based on the positive reviews and I&#x27;m super glad I did.  My curler arrived quickly but unfortunately became bent during transit.  I contacted Crave Naturals and they immediately sent out a replacement (Priority Mail!) so I&#x27;d have it as soon as possible.  My replacement arrived two days later and I was able to take it for a test run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I love the packaging and the travel clip on this curler.  My old curler didn&#x27;t have one but it&#x27;s a really nice feature.  The handle is very ergonomic and comfortable, easy to get a good grip on.  The shape of the curler is wonderful, no pinched eyelids!  My lashes look very naturally curled, no weird bent line like my Sephora curler was prone to doing.  Crave Naturals also provided 10 additional pads, which is incredibly generous compared to drugstore and even high end brands.  I highly recommend checking out the hype for yourself!</li>
    <li> Works as well if not better than curlers that cost twice as much. Nice having 5 refill pads instead of just one or two.</li>
    <li> amazing product with great customer service!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this but just can&#x27;t. I gave it 2 stars bc it&#x27;s cute and I like the color. But will be going back to my cheap Revlon curler. This one is much harder to use than I expect and pinches my eyelids. I can avoid pinching if I am really really careful but never had this issue with my old curler bc I don&#x27;t have the time or patience to deal with this one every morning.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler has so much potential.  It curls wll but the pink cushiony thing falls out all the time- and I keep losing them.  Seriously they only need to be slightly bigger and I think they might last.  I usually Revlon or Covergirl and think Ill try to remove their cushion and put it on this curler.  The curler itself works well and feels sturdy- but its useless by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok - so I have an email address solely for Amazon as I order quite a bit from here.  Anyway, I rarely check it.  The company Crave Naturals wrote me a rather nice email letting me know they had an issue with an incorrect batch of pads.  Nice to know they addressed it and it appears they really care about service.  I&#x27;ll update the stars to 5 if the new pads really work but with this kind of service I am guessing I am going to love my curler- all parts of it.</li>
    <li> Much like other reviewers, I was excited to try this eyelash curler. The first couple of days it was fine, but then the spring in the curler popped out. I emailed the company and they were soooo awesome and sent me a replacement curler with even more pads. However, the one they sent me seemed faulty already. The metal part that held the pad was crooked and pulled out eyelashes already. I was not happy and did not want to try a third time. I emailed the company and asked for a refund. Great customer service but bad product (they even sent me a free detangler brush which was nice of them). I feel bad for the bad review though :(.</li>
    <li> I have been on the hunt for an eyelash curler for what seems like an eternity now! I tried Earth Therapeutics (awful), Japonesque (broke in a month) and finally this one after reading rave reviews. It not only pinched the heck out of my eyelashes but it ended up pulling at least 2 out with each crimp. Although it did give my lashes a nice curl, the curl never lasted for more than an hour. Back to the drawing board...</li>
    <li> I was actually very surprised by this curler. Most have windsheild wiper blade type cushions that are cheap and flimsy. If you as k me it only adds to the creasing of the lashes. This had thick, durable cushions. I was quite pleased how soft they were and how cofortable it was to use.&lt;br /&gt; I really like the bigger gripping handles to ensure i keep it in place well while curling. I also LOVE that it&#x27;s pink!!! It makes it very fashionable.&lt;br /&gt;I also really like that my curl lasted all day! I expected to have to touch up between work and night life but i didn&#x27;t. It came with a bunch of extra pads which is really awesome. I always get fed up trying to find replacements anf just buy a whole new curler. Which gets really expensive. This will save me some money so in my opinion it&#x27;s a great buy. Definitely worth having! My two teenage girls love it also. Of course we clean it in between.. don&#x27;t need any eye infections going around the house! So these will make great stocking stuffers for them this year. I&#x27;m actually thinking I may just pick up more as gifts for my mom and nieces as well! Every women deserves pretty lashes!</li>
    <li> Love love love this li&#x27;l sucker! Curls very effectively without pinching my lids, and the customer service is awesome! The description says it comes with 5 refill pads and mine had 9 in it. Also they gave a coupon for 25% off next crave naturals purchase. I have big eyes and this is wide enough to get all of m&#x27;lashes without being to flat but it&#x27;s not too rounded either. Similar to sally Hansen but better! And it feels sturdy, no cheap spring!</li>
    <li> This is a terrific eyelash curler that is so easy to use and very effective.  It curled my lashes&lt;br /&gt;with very little effort and made it extremely easy to apply mascara...Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this eyelash curler seems to have such positive reviews because it is seriously such poor quality. I will say that it curled my eyelashes really well, it didn&#x27;t pinch my eyelids and the curl held all day, but it completely fell apart within a few weeks of use. First one of the plastic handles cracked and half of it fell off, then the other handle followed. By this past week the pink plastic had literally crumbled inside of my makeup bag. I want to emphasize that I had done nothing to the curler to cause this aside from leaving it sitting inside of my purse. This is not even to mention the fact that the rubber pads would never stay put, and this is obviously the reason why the curler has a locking mechanism. It&#x27;s really too bad because this eyelash curler does its fundamental job well, it&#x27;s just so ridiculously cheaply made that it&#x27;s not worth spending money on.    *edit*  Wow! I&#x27;m going to bump up my rating a little bit because I received a replacement and a refund within days of writing this review, and that is some great customer service. The rubber pads on the replacement also seem to stay put and it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart yet, so so far so good!</li>
    <li> I received my curler today, but I noticed that the left side of the curler is slanted (the part where it gets pushed up), and I saw on other videos that it is supposed to be horizontal, and it made my eye lashed curved unevenly :( I was excited to try it but I am disappointed that my product is not what it is advertised to be.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it ,I experience a little pinch with the eyelash curler. But the second time I used it didn&#x27;t experience any pinching or any discomfort with the eyelash curler. I like the box how colorful it looks and has a great design. It has a great little latch to it to keep the handles apart when your not using it. It comes with a lot of replacement pads. I have never seen that other companies that give replacement pads. I have ever received with any other eyelash curler . I love how they think about the customer .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I don&#x27;t use mascara and eyelashes curler I can&#x27;t see my lashes because I don&#x27;t have a lot of lashes and it is really thin so when I use Whip Lash Eyelash Curler it looks dramatic. My lashes had a lot more length and it look more fuller. I recommend this product if your looking for a new Eyelash Curler.</li>
    <li> This curler works really well. I used to buy the Shu Umera curler, but I wanted to try something else. The only issue with this curler is that it&#x27;s not great for travel since the hard plastic handles break easily. I broke the grip after one trip. When the seller followed-up for feedback, I told them about the grip, and they sent a new one right away.  Also, they supplied the wrong replacement pads in the initial order and notified all their customers that they would send complimentary, correctly sized pads. Those arrived in two days. The customer service is excellent and deserves 5 stars. Just wish that they would just the handle material to rubber or something more pliable.</li>
    <li> This is a really solid eyelash curler, I&#x27;m always on the look out for a well made curler, this one even has a locking device at the bottom that keeps it closed which is nice for traveling. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because the replacement pads don&#x27;t seem to sit properly like the one that originally came on the curler.  It&#x27;s weird because they seem to be the same but like I said, the replacement ones keep popping up on the sides and I have to reposition with each use. Other than that, it doesn&#x27;t pinch and offers a lovely curl.</li>
    <li> I have big eyes, and was glad these got *all* of my lashes for a change. Nice and close. This eyelash curler was a game changer for me. Doesn&#x27;t beat up my lashes, and they&#x27;re up and good for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Company made great contact after my purchase, and though I had no issues, I am confident they would resolve things quickly.</li>
    <li> I just ordered last night and received the next day. That was fast! Thank you for the discount. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash curler! I love the color of the handle and I like the fact that there is a latch to it. At first, the curler was kind of difficult to maneuver but it gets easier over time to get used to it. It came with 10 extra pads so when your current pad gets dirty and grimy, you can change it for a new one. I don&#x27;t have big, full lashes but whenever I use this curler, it makes my eyes pop out and my lashes look longer.</li>
    <li> Best eyelash curler !!!!!!</li>
    <li> it was time to change lash curling from the old cheap one and this works great.</li>
    <li> The curler works well and the company gives fantastic customer service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same curler for years and it&#x27;s nothing compared to this one!! I had a revlon one and it didn&#x27;t work nearly as good as this one even when it was brand new. I have really extremely long lashes but they are sooo straight and it&#x27;s very hard to get them to curl let alone keep a curl all day. I&#x27;ve been using this one for a few days and it&#x27;s lasted the whole day long and it gives a pretty rounded curl rather than a crimp. I haven&#x27;t had any lashes rip out or any problems, yet. I love it, def recommending for people with my type of lashes it works beautifully.</li>
    <li> It was fine until it just basically shattered to pieces! Only had for two months. So disappointed. This has never happened to a curse I&#x27;ve bought from the store.  Update: I was contacted and sent their new version in Aug. The new one definitely looks like it won&#x27;t shatter like the picture in the original review. Still it pinches more than I would like but it is decent for the price/amount of replacement pads and the prompt customer service.</li>
    <li> The rubber is not stay, throw away after one week. Go back to my old shu uemura curler. Waste of my money.</li>
    <li> this product is kind of weird. I&#x27;ve noticed it doesn&#x27;t want you to squeeze like at all. which is different than most eye last curlers. if you do it will give you way too tight of a curl and you can&#x27;t get it down. but if you don&#x27;t do it just tight enough then it won&#x27;t curl half of them. so you have to get it just right. seems a lot more difficult than any i have used in the past.</li>
    <li> For some reason it hurts my eyelids. Worse it made my contacts pop out. I did not like it at all.</li>
    <li> Works great however the rubber inserts like to fall out</li>
    <li> There’s a cushioney feel to the Whiplash curler which I’ve never experienced with the old style that I’ve used for years. I’ve recently switched to dry mascara (to be kinder to my lashes) and I thought that it would be good to switch curlers too, since the Whiplash seemed as if it would be kinder to lashes, as well.</li>
    <li> i actually got a couple of compliments on my lashes after using this product ! I loooove it !! It is my favorite color and simple to use. I didm&#x27;t lose any lashes either :)</li>
    <li> Product given for Testing and Review Purposes&lt;br /&gt;This curler is very strong and sturdy and it really gives your lashes a lift. Its a little tricky at first so you need to take your time using it because you might find it a little stiff with the clamping but its not something that will ruin your lashes or give you a bruise to your lid. Just make sure you open your eye and clamp down gently until your desired lift. I also like that the Whip Lash has a little metal piece to hold the curler in place once not in use.&lt;br /&gt;Personally I wish it wasn&#x27;t so stiff but they do really give your lashes a great curl, especially when you top it with your favorite mascara. The Whip Lash comes with 10 pads and it also comes with a 25% coupon card off your next purchase of any Crave Naturals products.&lt;br /&gt;I left a little youtube video to see me using The Whip Lash and the finished look with my Jennifer Bradley Monster mascara.&lt;br /&gt;My lashes look longer, fuller and thicker giving me that doe eyed effect!&lt;br /&gt;http://youtu.be/Tw7djosswqI</li>
    <li> Great brush for tangles</li>
    <li> I love using this! I won it from Crave Naturals and I&#x27;m so happy I did! They had great customer communication as well. It only took a minute to have more of a curl to my lashes. It makes them pop!</li>
    <li> The first time I tried using it i may have pressed too hard but it cut off a lot of my eyelashes! Luckily I&#x27;m asian so I don&#x27;t have a lot to lose... But still. I probably won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, quick shipping.  Good purchase</li>
    <li> Seriously, I have never had as good of customer service as these lovely people. Here&#x27;s what happened:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I order my eyelash curler, they send an email saying all sorts good things about the product and that I should have it shortly, should I need anything contact them. I get the product, and of course love it! Unfortunately, after like 2 weeks it broke on me, sad right? I don&#x27;t know if the metal clasp was just bad or if I did something to it on accident. Either way, I left some feedback for them, but ended up giving them 5 stars anyway because I had, had the product long enough to know it wasn&#x27;t defective right out of the package, and it worked WAY better than I thought it would. I have really long natural eyelashes and this is just what I needed to give my eyes that &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; I was looking for. Anyway, I left them perfect feedback saying it was more than what I expected, unfortunately it broke but I didn&#x27;t want that to diminish the quality and service overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 days later, a new curler shows up in my mail. I didn&#x27;t really even complain, but they went above and beyond and did me a solid. WE need customer service like this and a company that stands 100% by their product. I&#x27;m so over the moon, what a great surprise!</li>
    <li> Great product. I bought for my teenage daughter and her lashes are beautiful. Nice company, they follow up to make sure you&#x27;re pleased with the product, and we are.</li>
    <li> I really like this curler, gets close to lash line without pinching and gives great curl. The one problem is that the pads wear out super fast like in a mater of days, and once the pad wears out (meaning it cuts through, breaking the pad in half) then it doesn&#x27;t cur and just crimps the lash, which is not good.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Excellent customer service follow up on the order. Not cheap, but worth it if you want a great brush.</li>
    <li> Love this Brush! I have thick hair and it just glides through my hair with ease with out ripping out my hair, great product.</li>
    <li> Just got it today!  I love it! My 6 year old brushed her own hair by herself today for the first time and was excited about it! Her hair looked great after. I also used it and had about 50% less hair fall out!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  They do exactly what they claim and even my daughter can use them. I think it&#x27;s great that they even come with extra pads. No pinching whatsoever, just as they claim.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t chop off my lashes like other curlers I&#x27;ve had. Curls them perfectly, and I&#x27;m glad it comes with so many replacements!</li>
    <li> works great love the extra pads are with it</li>
    <li> I love how this curls my eyelashes so well! Best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever encountered and will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I have received this product for free for review. This eyelash curler is very easy to use and it a nice product. I love the way it helps my lashes look amazing .</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I have ever tried!  My hair tangles really bad. I am amazed at how much hair was in my old brush by the time I was done brushing it and it would hurt until I got rid of all the tangles. With the Crave Naturals brush, it is pain free and barely any hair loss at all.  I am so happy with the brush, I ordered one for my daughter and daughter in law.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Works really well for me, you don&#x27;t have to use the dryer any more</li>
    <li> This is by the far the best eyelash curler I have ever used. However, one of the pink handles for my finger broke. I have continued to use it but it is inconvenient. Wish they sold replacements for the handle. Regardless, it is a must buy.</li>
    <li> The little thing that holds the two ends together flew off and I&#x27;ve had better luck with my old Revlon curler.</li>
    <li> Love it !! It give a very close curl and makes it easier than traditional curlers</li>
    <li> The eyelash Curler is great, no pinching. My old Cutler did that constantly. They go out of their way to make sure everything is good with the product and that your happy with it.</li>
    <li> Very useful and well made goods. I like it very much.</li>
    <li> I hope to return this, very disappointing.</li>
    <li> this curler is great!</li>
    <li> This brush works wonders on my granddaughters hair. No more screaming!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s terrific!! I am really excited to use this wonderful product!! I definitely recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> whiplash eyelash curler works really great! they curled my lashes perfectly and with no pinching! i have short lashes so i really need the extra oomph! love the super cushiony pads included! also, the pads are removable so you can replace if needed! So glad i got the opportunity to test and review crave whiplash eyelash curlers for free for testing and review purposes!</li>
    <li> These broke within 2 weeks of owning them. I was better off with cheap junk.</li>
    <li> Amazing eyelash curler!!!! Gives eyelashes an amazing lift! The product came with refill pads that didn&#x27;t fit too well but the customer service was extremely helpful and proactive and mailed me new refill pads immediately. I strongly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Crave eyelash curler and was very disappointed in the product because it kept ripping my eye lashes out during each use. I though it might be the pad so I replaced it and tried again and it continued to do the same thing :(. I wanted to like it but I&#x27;m afraid if I keep using it I won&#x27;t have any lashes left.</li>
    <li> The product is just okay, nothing special. Plus it has a few issues. I have been using it for a few weeks now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works okay&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box it came it, whilst quite original looked quite tatty as if it had either been a return or opened &amp; closed several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag of spare pads do not fit the curler correctly &amp; on closer inspection you can tell they are not the same as the pad that comes inserted in the curler. It is a slightly different color and will not fit the same as the original pad, rendering the spares useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does pinch the corner of my lid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little silver bit that holds it together when not in use broke off after a couple of uses. It is rather flimsy</li>
    <li> I returned it.Pads are too soft.,pinches,doesn&#x27;t&#x27; curl well or evenly.they sent me a new one with much for my pads and they work much better. Very good customer service</li>
    <li> I like this curler but it is really stiff to use. It does curl the the lashes but like every other eye lash curler you have to really pump it and use it over and over just to get the lashes to stay up. At least that&#x27;s what I have to do with mine.</li>
    <li> The crimper part was too sharp and sliced through the rubber piece.  Too scared to use this as I didn&#x27;t know what it would do to my poor eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I never thought I could have such strong opinions an eye lash curler. This design is flawless, at least for me. The curve perfectly fits my eye so I can get super close to the lash line without ever pinching. It also feels super comfortable and sturdy in your hand, which is important when you&#x27;re clamping pieces of metal together millimeters from your eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others, I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the durability of the rubber lash pad. Before I say more, let me say that they now have NEW, UPGRADED BLACK LASH PADS.  If you are using the pink ones and are unsatisfied they will send you some of the black ones for free. I could not be more happy with their customer service.  I let them know I wasn&#x27;t satisfied and within 24 hours they responded saying they had upgraded their lash pads based on customers&#x27; reviews and would send me some of the new refills immediately.  They seem to truly care about customer satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Before knowing this, I purchased another lash curler at a similar price point because I didn&#x27;t want to deal with constantly replacing the Whiplash&#x27;s pink lash pad. I bought the Eye &amp; Mighty By Bella and Bear eye lash curler, and that one is pretty good, but I absolutely prefer Whiplash. The Eye &amp; Mighty is much straighter than Whiplash, so my center lashes ended up curled close to the root, while my other lashes had a crimp halfway between the root and the tip.  It also didn&#x27;t have as nice of a grip as Whiplash...after using Whiplash&#x27;s wide and sturdy handles any other curler feels flimsy and unstable.  Again, you don&#x27;t really want to worry about your grip slipping on a metal tool you&#x27;re using on your eye.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!  I&#x27;ve been using a $5 revlon eyelash curler and have always thought my eyelashes where small and wimpy. Turns out the curler I was using was not really good because this tool really makes my eyelashes look long. They pretty much go from non existent to brushing the bottom of my eyebrows. This is the best tool I&#x27;ve bought for my eyes thus far. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> it is pinch free compared to others...love it</li>
    <li> Initially, I was very pleased with the eyelash curler. But after just two weeks of use the replaceable rubber broke. And yes, even though it comes with 10 replaceable rubbers I have already used 3.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY -- CUT MY LASHES IN HALF!!&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this because of all the great reviews, but almost cried when I used it the third time and it cut my lashes on both eyes in half!!!  I have used eyelash curlers for at least 10 years and followed the directions (curled without any makeup on).  All ladies want long full lashes and now half of the lashes on each eye are tiny.  If I could give this product zero stars, I would.  So so so disappointed.  Now I have to see how long it takes for my lashes to be back to normal.  Beyond upset.</li>
    <li> Initially I had a slight problem with the pads..but the most excellent customer service dept. Was on their toes!! Sent me new pads that work wonderfully. .wonderful company that loves its customers..and respects them.</li>
    <li> Super cute packaging right?!  I love anything retro.  Look how many extra refill pads they give you too!  All other curlers I&#x27;ve ever bought give 1-3 extra pads.  There are 10 in this.  Awesome deal.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. I tried it many times, but to no avail.</li>
    <li> This a great eyelash curler. But the rubber thingy falls out everyday. But they send you a pack of them so you have back-ups. If it were not for that, it would be the best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> The Crave &amp;#34;Whip Lash&amp;#34; eyelash curler has the most adorable packaging! Not only that, but it matches with the pink, plastic grips.  The curler also comes with refill pads and a card with a promo code inside for a discount on future purchases from Crave Naturals. So what makes this curler different for other curlers? Well, it has dual handed grips! You can use this curler with ease with either your left OR right hand.  I think that&#x27;s an excellent feature on this curler. It&#x27;s very easy to grip and has excellent working mechanics to easily grip, curl and volumize your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Adorable packaging&lt;br /&gt;Pink, versatile grips&lt;br /&gt;Easy holding and maneuvering&lt;br /&gt;Comes with refill pads&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a Coupon code for future purchase&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The price is a bit high for a lash curler&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an excellent curler! I think this would make a great gift too.</li>
    <li> It actually works much better than the other curlers I have.  I have Asian lashes which are much harder to curl.  It curls it easily.  The only complaint is that the curl doesn&#x27;t last, but it&#x27;s not the product&#x27;s fault.  I blame genetics.  But as far as curlers go, it&#x27;s a great one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item in July 2014, and I loved it.  It is ergonomic and does not require much force or time to get fabulous lashes.  Mine did break in Dec 2014.  The top metal bar solder broke off.  I contacted the company, and they promptly expedited a replacement.  This company has amazing customer service, and they do all they can to ensure you are satisfied.  I highly recommend this eyelash curler!</li>
    <li> I am an eyelash curler snob.  I have used every kind over the years, most recently a very expensive Shiseido curler- but after the replacement pads kept breaking on it, I ordered this curler.  It.  Is.  Awesome.  No pinching, no pulling out hairs, easy to wipe clean and came with TONS of replacement pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service too from Crave Naturals, they sent me a very nice email thanking me for ordering the product and to check that I liked it and that the pads were working.</li>
    <li> I have curled my lashes since I was a young girl (so a very very long time!) and these are by far the BEST curlers I have every used!  This is my daughters first curler, and I wanted to be sure that it would be easy to use and not pinch (which these claim not to do) and it is indeed easy to use and they don&#x27;t pinch at all!  There was a recall on the pads that came with mine, and when I brought it to the attention of customer service, they were extremely prompt in sending out replacement pads (and a lot of them!) and this was during the busy holiday season! They have been extremely attentive and have made everything about this transaction top notch - Thank you so much for focusing on Customer Care - it&#x27;s a rarity these days!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review for anything in my life and am finally doing it for this well worth item. I am crazy obsessed with this lash curler, it makes my eyelashes look like I have faux eyelashes. Over the past few months I have ruined my eyelashes by using fake eyelashes and have not been able to even make my eyelashes look somewhat decent even with the best mascara. Well my eyelashes are better than they ever have been in my whole life thanks to the help of this eyelash curler!!!</li>
    <li> I had my eyelash curler about 2 weeks &amp; as I opened the curler my eyelashes were cut off &amp; stuck on the curler!!! There was a tear in the pad already &amp; it cut my eyelashes off like I was using scissors on them. Needless to say I am not happy with this product!!</li>
    <li> I bought this lash curler because I lost my previous Shu Uemura curler and the great reviews but unfortunately, this curler pinches my eyelids and has cut my already short lashes! It does everything but curl my lashes! Ugh. And the reason they probably give you so many pads is because they wear out easily, thanks to the sharp upper blade. Don&#x27;t get this curler - Shu Uemura curlers are the best, invest in them.</li>
    <li> Hmmm....was asked to review this peoduct, however it is not the product u purcHased. I bought the crave wet hairbrush, which is phenomenoL.</li>
    <li> Could never find anything that fit the curve of my eye. This is SOOO AMAZING.</li>
    <li> not the curler but a brush - the only thing that can go thought grandbabys hair with out tears- yeah!!!!! buy this ! quick shipping</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS...first eyelash curler that beautifully curls my lashes but doesn&#x27;t pull them out or crimp them.</li>
    <li> I love this detangling brush. I have always been tender-headed and this brush definitely helps ease thru the snarls!</li>
    <li> l am satisfied your goods.</li>
    <li> No pinch! Perfect curl!</li>
</ol>
