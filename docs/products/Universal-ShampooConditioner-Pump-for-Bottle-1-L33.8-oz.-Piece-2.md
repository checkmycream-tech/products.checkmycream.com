      <li>Then I couldn&#x27;t get the top piece to pop up so that I&#x27;d be able to pump the shampoo out of the bottle.</li>

      <li>Loved these at first, but one of them has just stopped working -</li>

      <li>The are easy to use, .</li>

      <li>well made and easy to use</li>
      <li>Had to trim these with sharp scissors to get them to fit, but once I did they work perfectly.</li>
      <li>they came in quickly!</li>
      <li>I got the pureology one thinking that I would fit the bottles like it should</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t fit the Matrix Biolage bottles.  </li>
      <li>These pumps are great quality, but about 2-1/2&amp;#34; too short for the 33.8 oz bottle.  </li>
      <li>I like the fact that they fit my shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>Works well and is very useful.</li>
      <li>The handle or top of the pump is very sturdy.</li>
      <li>Sure make it a lot easier not to use to much</li>
      <li>Pumps did not work, was offered full refund</li>
      <li>Holding up good after a couple of months of daily use.</li>
      <li>I mean...how many different screw top sizes can there be for 1 liter (33.8 oz) shampoo bottles?</li>
      <li>price was right, delivery was quick.</li>
      <li>They were sold as an add on the the large Enjoy shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>Stem was just the right length.</li>
      <li>works great with the tall heavy shampoo bottle!</li>
      <li>It puts out the right amount the first pump.</li>
      <li>Glad I purchased these as my shampoo I buy is in big bottles and did not come&lt;</li>
      <li>May be able to use on different product.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Did not come with the attached straw part, only the top pump part.</li>
      <li>Usually with pumps, you twist them a certain way and the top piece pops up, and your able to pump the product - not in this case.</li>
      <li>Fits the large bottles of Wella shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>The pump part works fine, although I have to use about 3 pumps to get enough product.</li>
      <li>Having to pick up that huge bottle of shampoo and conditioner can be tricky, especially before the morning coffee.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping</li>
      <li>Only one set fit together -</li>
      <li>really?</li>
      <li>Came fast.</li>
      <li>Worked very well with the tall Nioxin 33.8oz.</li>
      <li>These are very convenient for the shower and they shipped fast.</li>
      <li>The pumps were red and cheap.</li>
      <li>Yet they were too long to fit in the bottles.</li>
      <li>The other works fine, however.</li>
      <li>They glide down easily and you don&#x27;t have to continually pump.</li>
      <li>Had to toss and buy new ones elsewhere.</li>
      <li>Amazon is great at offering you secondary products that other shoppers purchase when you select a main item.</li>
      <li>First of all, only one of them screwed onto my shampoo bottle easily, the other one barely tightened onto my bottle.</li>
      <li>The pumps fit in the 1liter bottles, but the pump itself is quite small, so you have to pump it several times to get an adequate amount of shampoo or conditioner.</li>
      <li>My main complaint is that these say they fit 1 liter bottles and they do screw on the tops fine, but they aren&#x27;t long enough.</li>
      <li>so far it works well...</li>
      <li>And since I really wanted the pumps I had to order a second set.</li>
      <li>However the order did not come to me complete.  </li>
      <li>The only suggestion I would give is that they had different colors (as the original bottle caps) to make easier to tell the shampoo from the conditioner, when seen from above.</li>
      <li>Since the bottles look exactly the same, from above, one will have to actually grab them to read and identify the product.</li>
      <li>but apparently I can&#x27;t - so now I&#x27;m just out $7</li>
      <li>Some said that they couldn&#x27;t get these open, but I had no trouble with the two I received.  </li>
      <li>There were no long plastic tubes included, just the pump part.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> What I bought was different than what I received.  The pumps were red and cheap.</li>
    <li> Perfect pump - love it...</li>
    <li> The pumps work great!</li>
    <li> one pump dose not work I ask if I can get replasment</li>
    <li> I had a bunch of the big bottles of shampoo but they&#x27;re too awkward to use in the shower, so I bought some small bottles and these pumps and cut down the pump tubes - works great.</li>
    <li> Pumps DO NOT touch bottom of bottle. At leased 1 1/2&amp;#34;-2&amp;#34; away from bottom and product!!!</li>
    <li> These are very convenient for the shower and they shipped fast.</li>
    <li> Works great very easy</li>
    <li> Both pumps broke within a few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Fit my liter shampoo and conditioner bottles perfectly!</li>
    <li> Worked great in large bottle of shampoo/ condidtioner.</li>
    <li> Sure make it a lot easier not to use to much</li>
    <li> As advertized, great product!</li>
    <li> These pumps make using shampoo and conditioner so much more effecient in the shower.  No more juggling or dropping bottles!</li>
    <li> These were ok. Only one of the pumps worked</li>
    <li> To be fair the pump works. The problem is that it&#x27;s too small diameter for my shampoo bottle. I mean...how many different screw top sizes can there be for 1 liter (33.8 oz) shampoo bottles? I mean....really? Check the screw top diameter of your bottle before ordering this.</li>
    <li> pumps work well. wish they would pump out a bit more product in one pump but does the job regardless</li>
    <li> Did not fit my Biolage bottle</li>
    <li> The pump part works fine, although I have to use about 3 pumps to get enough product. My main complaint is that these say they fit 1 liter bottles and they do screw on the tops fine, but they aren&#x27;t long enough. They leave about 2 - 3 inches of product in the bottom of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I like these especially in the kid&#x27;s bathroom where they can use an entire bottle of bath wash in one application.  The pumps give a small amount of shampoo or bath wash at a time, which has cut down on the amount I&#x27;ve had to spend each month on these products.  You can cut the plastic insert to any length you need and transfer it from bottle to bottle.  Works great!</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery and exactly as expected.  Holding up good after a couple of months of daily use.</li>
    <li> Once I got the full set I liked it.  However the order did not come to me complete.  There was a part missing.  I had to order a second set in order to get two working pumps. I tried contacting the shipper and got no response.  And since I really wanted the pumps I had to order a second set.</li>
    <li> When I received this item, the straw pieces and pump part are separate and need to be attached. Only one set fit together - the other straw and pump did not fit together.</li>
    <li> These pumps are great quality, but about 2-1/2&amp;#34; too short for the 33.8 oz bottle.  Work perfectly for the smaller bottles&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I was shipped the wrong ones?</li>
    <li> Every time you push down on these things, IT PUSHES STUFF OUT!</li>
    <li> The pumps did not function at all.</li>
    <li> They are a little short. They do not go down all the way to the bottom. Will be a problem when the shampoo is running out</li>
    <li> perfect,exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> These pumps fit perfectly in my shampoo and conditioner bottles</li>
    <li> My wife loves these!! And if it makes her happy, it makes me happy!</li>
    <li> Some said that they couldn&#x27;t get these open, but I had no trouble with the two I received.  I have been able to &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; them for use when I need to.</li>
    <li> They were sold as an add on the the large Enjoy shampoo and conditioner. Yet they were too long to fit in the bottles. If I had search for them separately I could understand having to cut them to fit which wasn&#x27;t easy!</li>
    <li> Ordered to accompany Shampoo and conditioner i also bought. Worked well.</li>
    <li> Did not come with the attached straw part, only the top pump part. Completely useless. Don&#x27;t waste your $$$$</li>
    <li> Came fast. Works perfect.</li>
    <li> Worked great in one liter pureology bottles</li>
    <li> One of the two pumps wouldn&#x27;t open and I returned it. The other works fine, however.</li>
    <li> Glad I purchased these as my shampoo I buy is in big bottles and did not come&lt;br /&gt;with the pumps so these work perfect!</li>
    <li> Awesome as 2 pumps could be! Would buy again great and prompt shipping and arrived on time! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I cannot get the pumps to actually work.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Fits the large bottles of Wella shampoo and conditioner. Makes washing and conditioning your hair a  great deal easier.</li>
    <li> Loved these at first, but one of them has just stopped working - I need to take it apart and figure out why, but I shouldn&#x27;t have to.  Only used it for about 30 days...</li>
    <li> works great with the tall heavy shampoo bottle!</li>
    <li> so far it works well... can&#x27;t give it a 5 until I see how it works when we get close to the bottom of the bottle</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t fit the Matrix Biolage bottles.  Will have to send back.</li>
    <li> Worked very well with the tall Nioxin 33.8oz. They actuate smoothly and dispense an appropriate amount of the product. The only suggestion I would give is that they had different colors (as the original bottle caps) to make easier to tell the shampoo from the conditioner, when seen from above. Since the bottles look exactly the same, from above, one will have to actually grab them to read and identify the product.</li>
    <li> I ordered two pumps for the 1L shampoo and conditioner. The pump is short and does not touch the bottom of the bottle.</li>
    <li> 1 pump doesn&#x27;t work!! To much trouble to return. Tired of things that dont work</li>
    <li> Not much to say.....price was right, delivery was quick.</li>
    <li> well made and easy to use</li>
    <li> I did no receive the tubes in the package, so I am unable to use.</li>
    <li> Had to reuturn them, they came without the tube.  The pump would be useless without the tube.</li>
    <li> Works ok. Hard to get primed after first use.</li>
    <li> What a great idea. Amazon is great at offering you secondary products that other shoppers purchase when you select a main item. I ordered two 33 OX. bottles of shampoo and conditioner. It never occurred to me to buy a set of p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE pumps are a great addition. The are easy to use, .</li>
    <li> Delivery, packaging and product were all great!  Thx!</li>
    <li> Pump didn&#x27;t really work very well at all, I used them in a thin solution shampoo and conditioner. The pump would go down and not cone back up at all on both bottles. Leaves a lot to be desired in a pump when neither of them will pump. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Ordered pumps, received a helicopter motor base(??)...</li>
    <li> The pump does not release enough volume of the product.  I have to pump it about 4 times to get the amount of shampoo/conditioner needed.  Normally only need to pump 1-2 times.  Would not purchase again, especially when I know I can get what I want for half the price at the beauty store in my town.</li>
    <li> These pumps are made to last and are heavy duty tough, built to last.</li>
    <li> Works great with my Biolage Liters</li>
    <li> These pumps were too short for Purology liter bottle... Could be because the bottle shape has been changed. The product works great and was delivered quickly though.</li>
    <li> I cannot get the pumps to work at all.  I twist and twist and they don&#x27;t open....waste of money</li>
    <li> The pumps fit in the 1liter bottles, but the pump itself is quite small, so you have to pump it several times to get an adequate amount of shampoo or conditioner.</li>
    <li> The pump did not fit my gallon shampoo containers.</li>
    <li> Arrived as advertised.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I needed it for!!</li>
    <li> Fits Dr. Bronner&#x27;s 1L soap bottles.</li>
    <li> Too short for the size of the bottle.  Otherwise it would have been great.  I got the pureology one thinking that I would fit the bottles like it should but....NO.  Wonder if I can still return them.</li>
    <li> Works well and is very useful.</li>
    <li> Fits Redken bottles perfectly, works great</li>
    <li> The pumps get stuck every time and you have to pull them up.  I tried both and have the same issue regardless of what liquid it is.</li>
    <li> FYI the long straw part of these is only about 4 inches long.</li>
    <li> Difficult to unlock nozzle</li>
    <li> Fast shipping im happy</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than expected.  Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> The pump does not fit the 33.8 oz bottle of Biolage shampoo for which I intended to use it for when I made the purchase.  May be able to use on different product.</li>
    <li> Not as pictured, poor quality, does not pump out an adequate amount of product.  Had to toss and buy new ones elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Pumps do not work. Waste of $</li>
    <li> Pumps did not work, was offered full refund</li>
    <li> Fit the bottles perfectly</li>
    <li> Not happy, arrived w/o straw to move product into pump.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t come close to the bottom of the bottle. Twists and is hard to pump. Returning.</li>
    <li> These fit my Kevin Murphy bottles perfectly!</li>
    <li> makes using the 33.8 oz bottles so easy. thank you</li>
    <li> The fact that I had to purchase these separately to use for the liter bottles of shampoo was ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Work as described for my 1 liter shampoo and conditioner bottles. Stem was just the right length. No issues with the pump action, worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> One of the two pumps never worked</li>
    <li> These didn&#x27;t even work!  Don&#x27;t waste your $$$!!!</li>
    <li> these were supposed to be long enough for 33 oz/liter of shampoo, but they were only 6 inches long! (only came down about halfway to bottom) Had to return</li>
    <li> I like the fact that they fit my shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised</li>
    <li> I have not used it yet but I am sure I will like it.</li>
    <li> These pumps are a lifesaver. Having to pick up that huge bottle of shampoo and conditioner can be tricky, especially before the morning coffee. Love these pumps. They glide down easily and you don&#x27;t have to continually pump. It puts out the right amount the first pump. The handle or top of the pump is very sturdy. I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> As promised, and white!</li>
    <li> Had to trim these with sharp scissors to get them to fit, but once I did they work perfectly. There&#x27;s even instructions on how to trim them, which makes sense if they don&#x27;t know how tall your bottle is.</li>
    <li> Works just as desired!</li>
    <li> I try not to write negative reviews, but I am very upset about these bottle pumps. First of all, only one of them screwed onto my shampoo bottle easily, the other one barely tightened onto my bottle. Then I couldn&#x27;t get the top piece to pop up so that I&#x27;d be able to pump the shampoo out of the bottle. Usually with pumps, you twist them a certain way and the top piece pops up, and your able to pump the product - not in this case. I want to return the item but apparently I can&#x27;t - so now I&#x27;m just out $7 and these are going into the trash. Please don&#x27;t buy this product - it is a waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just going to go to target or a beauty store to find these things.. what a crappy product.</li>
    <li> Super fast shiemt great product</li>
    <li> they came in quickly! work great. no more juggling liter bottles of shampoo in the shower!</li>
    <li> Once I figured out how  to get them to work,  they  are great.</li>
    <li> There were no long plastic tubes included, just the pump part.  It will work until the product goes down about a half inch.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Fit my large shampoo/conditioner perfectly.  Mine had broken after they fell in the shower.  Make my life easier with a pump.</li>
