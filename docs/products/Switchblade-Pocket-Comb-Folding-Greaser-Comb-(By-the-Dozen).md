### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>These were the best christmas presents ever!</li>
      <li>Very happy with the purchase.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They worked great!</li>
      <li>All my nephews loved them!</li>
      <li>LOL</li>
      <li>The price was outstanding, the quality good (have not had any malfunction), and a wonderful take-home gift for kids at an event (e.g., birthday party).</li>
      <li>The kids loved them.</li>
      <li>Bought a dozen of them because the price was just to good to pass up.</li>
      <li>The quality is ok considering the great price.</li>
      <li>It may be my own fault, but I thought I was ordering one comb, but missed the fact that I was buying a dozen.</li>
      <li>Too cool!!</li>
      <li>They are ok.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t do much with it - great for novelty and that is about it.</li>
      <li>The rest is made of some sort of malleable metal (tin or aluminum perhaps?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is better buying by the dozen than per unit.</li>
      <li>I make theatre props, and I was able to make the combs look like switchblade knives for a production of West Side Story.</li>
      <li>All in all, I think that these were ok, and that my comb was just defective and that it just wasn&#x27;t meant to be, but I did get some cash for a kind of cheap but cool item</li>
      <li>Very cool.</li>
      <li>Really cool kids love them</li>
      <li>Still a cool product...though quality could be better.</li>
      <li>Needed them for a theatre production... have worked wonderful so far, and they&#x27;ve gotten quite the abuse so far.  </li>
      <li>Had one when I was young and loved it.</li>
      <li>They are cheap like you&#x27;d find at an arcade, but still a lot of fun!</li>
      <li>and they are a first choice for most of my partaker&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ll make good stocking stuffers for Christmas or white elephant gifts.</li>
      <li>Lots of fun for party favor.</li>
      <li>Fun while they work.</li>
      <li>These combs are so much fun for kids and adults.</li>
      <li>12 of them, ridiculously fun, and handy for theatrical prop building.  </li>
      <li>The kids had a lot of fun with them.</li>
      <li>Pretty cool.</li>
      <li>The combs came pretty quickly and were as advertised.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The price is right for these switchblade combs.</li>
      <li>It also would not close right sometimes, and the lock did not function well either.</li>
      <li>I gave them to some friends and some friends that were pretty much bald, and told them that they will enjoy it, and never &amp;#34;part with it.  </li>
      <li>Great gift, even comes in a small makeshift cardboard box.</li>
      <li>They are all metal and pretty well made.</li>
      <li>But some of them are really good and last for a really long time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;We ordered a whole box so that we could make them into \\&quot;switchblade</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Here you get 12, if one breaks or gets lost or one of their buddy&#x27;s comes over and wants one, we&#x27;ll have extras to give out.</li>
      <li>I bought these combs by the dozen to sell at a swap meet, and they sold ultra fast.</li>
      <li>Fun novelty for the young and nestalgic alike.</li>
      <li>I recommend these, they open extremely quick like a real switchblade knife.</li>
      <li>Delivery was quick and they are exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
      <li>Great deal, I was going to buy one at a store for 3$ cost less to buy it in a dozen.&lt;br /&gt;Opened up a few to inspect them all working well.</li>
      <li>A bit flimsy, but not disappointed, as they are as I expected them to be!</li>
      <li>cute party favors, feels solid, but you can tell after excessive playing it will probably break.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t going to last forever, but they&#x27;ve lastest far longer than I thought they would.  </li>

    <li> Very cool. Bought a dozen of them because the price was just to good to pass up. I wanted three of these for my three sons for stocking stuffers and if you look, they&#x27;re out there, however, you&#x27;re gonna pay 3-5$ a piece for them plus shipping. Here you get 12, if one breaks or gets lost or one of their buddy&#x27;s comes over and wants one, we&#x27;ll have extras to give out. I recommend these, they open extremely quick like a real switchblade knife. Too cool!!</li>
    <li> Great deal, I was going to buy one at a store for 3$ cost less to buy it in a dozen.&lt;br /&gt;Opened up a few to inspect them all working well. Great gift, even comes in a small makeshift cardboard box.</li>
    <li> The combs came pretty quickly and were as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We ordered a whole box so that we could make them into \\&quot;switchblade knife\\&quot; props: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They worked great!</li>
    <li> These were the best christmas presents ever! The kids loved them. Thanks</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh! we used these at our 1950s sock hop party. All my nephews loved them! They are cheap like you&#x27;d find at an arcade, but still a lot of fun!</li>
    <li> I gave them to some friends and some friends that were pretty much bald, and told them that they will enjoy it, and never &amp;#34;part with it.  LOL</li>
    <li> A bit flimsy, but not disappointed, as they are as I expected them to be!</li>
    <li> Fun novelty for the young and nestalgic alike. Was going to just get two for my boys. Got a dozen instead and gave them out to the kids at heart of my age. Had one when I was young and loved it. Had to pass on the memories</li>
    <li> It may be my own fault, but I thought I was ordering one comb, but missed the fact that I was buying a dozen. They&#x27;ll make good stocking stuffers for Christmas or white elephant gifts. Otherwise, I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ll do with all of these.</li>
    <li> I make theatre props, and I was able to make the combs look like switchblade knives for a production of West Side Story.</li>
    <li> The quality is ok considering the great price. We bought them for a &amp;#34;Outsider&amp;#34; party. Some of the spring blades only worked a few times. But again, considering the price we did not expect them to last forever. The kids had a lot of fun with them. I would buy them again as a party accessory.</li>
    <li> Lots of fun for party favor.</li>
    <li> Really cool kids love them</li>
    <li> 12 of them, ridiculously fun, and handy for theatrical prop building.  They work as combs, too!</li>
    <li> 1 of the switchblade combs did not open as well as the others.&lt;br /&gt;Only 2 of the 12 had a safety lock that was firm and not loose.&lt;br /&gt;Handle grip and comb are made of lightweight plastic. The rest is made of some sort of malleable metal (tin or aluminum perhaps?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is better buying by the dozen than per unit. Still a cool product...though quality could be better.</li>
    <li> On a scale of 1 out of 10 I would give these switch blade combs an 8. They are ok. Sometimes they break or stop working. But some of them are really good and last for a really long time. The locks on the combs are terrible. They work but they wont stay locked.</li>
    <li> Same as those awarded at arcades.  The price was outstanding, the quality good (have not had any malfunction), and a wonderful take-home gift for kids at an event (e.g., birthday party).</li>
    <li> Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Pretty cool. Can&#x27;t do much with it - great for novelty and that is about it.</li>
    <li> The price is right for these switchblade combs. The product is wrong for these very bad quality combs. Stopped working after 10 or so  activations. Fun while they work.</li>
    <li> Needed them for a theatre production... have worked wonderful so far, and they&#x27;ve gotten quite the abuse so far.  They aren&#x27;t going to last forever, but they&#x27;ve lastest far longer than I thought they would.  Delivery was quick and they are exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
    <li> cute party favors, feels solid, but you can tell after excessive playing it will probably break. But for the price, they were quality and you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I bought these combs by the dozen to sell at a swap meet, and they sold ultra fast. I saved one for myself, but unfortunately I got the bad one out of the bunch. My comb kept, for some reason, opening in my pocket. It also would not close right sometimes, and the lock did not function well either. All in all, I think that these were ok, and that my comb was just defective and that it just wasn&#x27;t meant to be, but I did get some cash for a kind of cheap but cool item</li>
    <li> Rather fragile, but easily adapted into a fake switchblade prop.</li>
    <li> These combs are so much fun for kids and adults. They are all metal and pretty well made. This is my second purchase of these I throw them in my birthday box and they are a first choice for most of my partaker&#x27;s.</li>
