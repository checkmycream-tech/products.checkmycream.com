      <li>This is the best!</li>
      <li>and I am a happy customer!</li>
      <li>Not the best of quality.</li>
      <li>This is simply great.</li>
      <li>I CHOSE THE &amp;#34;GRAPPLER&amp;#34; AND I AM SO HAPPY</li>
      <li>This device is great.  </li>
      <li>Of all four, my preference for light-duty in home use is the is the Ettore, but this Grappler and the Unger are also great.</li>
      <li>I have two and find them a great help.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great tool, built well and</li>
      <li>I have the 33&amp;#34; and 40&amp;#34; Grapplers which both work great.  </li>
      <li>Very handy picking up trash along the road.</li>
      <li>Best product available as a &#x27;pick-up&#x27; tool.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>He uses his every day and both are still working flawlessly after a couple years worth of use.</li>
      <li>I decided on this Grappler after looking at a number of brands; I liked its construction and durability, and felt it was a good value.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad!</li>
      <li>and I just love it!  </li>
      <li>He liked it so well</li>
      <li>I think that the Ettore, Grappler, and Unger are all good products and I&#x27;m pleased with them all - they are individually better at some applications than others.</li>
      <li>I think that the Ettore, Grappler, and Unger are all good products and I&#x27;m pleased with them all - they are individually better at some applications than others.</li>
      <li>It is so strong!</li>
      <li>Unger is between the Ettore and Grappler in terms of sturdiness, It applies more force than the Ettore, and also has more angular and aggressive pads.</li>
      <li>However, unlike the Unger and Grappler, the gripping mechanism on the Ettore is made of plastic</li>
      <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>But the rubberized clasps make sure you aren&#x27;t going to damage what you are grabbing.  </li>
      <li>The Grappler tool is made from heavier, stronger materials than most reaching tools.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>We got one of these, and it works much better for him as he recovers from hip and spine surgeries.</li>
      <li>This is the best picker upper I&#x27;ve ever owned, it picks up any and everything!!</li>
      <li>I asked at the time what a better choice would be.</li>
      <li>If you want a lightweight one to have with you in the house by your chair, then something else would do that better.</li>
      <li>I AM THINKING ABOUT REPLACING SOME OF MY CHEAPER PICKUP TOOLS WITH MORE &amp;#34;GRAPPLERS&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I trust it in most instances.</li>
      <li>However, unlike the Unger and Grappler, the gripping mechanism on the Ettore is made of plastic</li>
      <li>This is a rigid, strong grabber that I can use to take cans of the top shelf without the fear of getting hurt,  The plastic grippers make it a safe, as does the strength of the grip.  </li>
      <li>It is very sturdy and can handle a good amount of weight.  </li>
      <li>The Unger uses a reverse &amp;#34;handbrake&#x27; design with the pivot at the end of the handle where most of the gripping strength seems to come from the first two fingers - which is ok.</li>
      <li>I have tried other pickup tools but this is the best.  </li>
      <li>material, well constructed &amp; easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Easy return and got credit from seller with no problem.  </li>
      <li>Grappler&#x27;s are both strong and convenient.  </li>
      <li>Ergonomics is not the strong point of the Grappler, strength and durability is.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also light and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>your service is quick!</li>
      <li>It is a huge help while my husband is at work.</li>
      <li>Got a great one at Walgreens made by Medline MDS86031RCE-light appears sturdy and works well in cane section for same price range as this one.</li>
      <li>FANTASTIC.</li>
      <li>is the swivel end and comfortable handle.</li>
      <li>This grappler is fantastic........</li>
      <li>Parts are available &amp; has a great&lt;</li>
      <li>This pickup tool is far superior to any of it&#x27;s competitors.  </li>
      <li>so it is not as well suited for picking up heavy objects or objects that require a great deal of gripping force.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need a gripper much for that, so I prefer the ergonomics of the Ettore to the accurate gripping of the Unger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so it is not as well suited for picking up heavy objects or objects that require a great deal of gripping force.</li>
      <li>It is an indispenasble tool in helping me keeping the yard clean.  </li>
      <li>I bought this primarily to retrieve socks that fall behind the dryer, then discovered it&#x27;s also the perfect way to reach the ceiling fan chains on my 10-ft ceilings!</li>
      <li>It took three tries, but I was successful.</li>
      <li>This grabber easily picks up the smallest pieces of paper, cigarette butts, and large items like  bottles.  </li>
      <li>This grab it stick is extremely useful.  </li>
      <li>It has certainly lived up to my expectations!</li>
      <li>Exactly as I had hoped.</li>
      <li>er recycling ;-)</li>
      <li>I never realized how many times during the day I have to bend until I came home from back surgery.</li>
      <li>I love this tool and just bought my second one.  </li>
      <li>, we got him a second one so he can leave them in the areas he most often uses them.</li>
      <li>I have been using two others for several years and have been quite satisfied.</li>
      <li>Compared to other similar products I have owned/used, this one is by far, the BEST !</li>
      <li>Overall it gives a solid level of control and a good grip.  </li>
      <li>If you need accurate gripping of small objects, get the Unger.  </li>
      <li>If you need accurate gripping of small objects, get the Unger.  </li>
      <li>I put a small screw in the stationary part to secure items like wood to hold it better.</li>
      <li>This is the only long handled grabber tool that I have purchased that really does do a good job of helping get what I need done.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Very helpful tool around the house and the yard.  </li>
      <li>It is so much safer than using a step stool.</li>
      <li>Will not last too long, I am sure!</li>
      <li>Still, it has done a stellar job so far when I needed it.</li>
      <li>It has difficulty with getting around fine objects, like a single piece of paper.  </li>
      <li>ALL WERE DIFFERENT AND HAD VARIOUS STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES (MORE WEAKNESSES THAN STRENGTHS)</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
      <li>For general purpose comfortable light-duty home use for picking up clothes, pill bottles, and the occasional shoe, consider the Ettore.e Ettore.</li>
      <li>For general purpose comfortable light-duty home use for picking up clothes, pill bottles, and the occasional shoe, consider the Ettore.</li>
      <li>If you need strong gripping for heavy objects (things like power tools, paint cans, etc), get the Grappler (bigger jaws) or Unger (smaller jaws).</li>
      <li>If you need strong gripping for heavy objects (things like power tools, paint cans, etc), get the Grappler (bigger jaws) or Unger (smaller jaws).</li>
      <li>It can be used as a temporary cane if you&#x27;re careful, yet my favorite is shopping in a grocery store and grabbing items above head height.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>Works great and is heavy duty enough to pick up lumber and any other item .</li>
      <li>My only complaint was that the jaws would not close tight enough to pick up twigs, but I fixed that issue by adding some foam inside the jaws and now it works perfectly.</li>
      <li>This is my personal preference 55 to 45 because of the straight and &amp;#34;L&amp;#34; shaped ends.  </li>
      <li>I bought a 33 inch for me (5&#x27;9\\&quot;) for use in the home to reach items on high shelves and deep cabinets.  </li>
      <li>IT IS A LITTLE BIT PRICEY BUT WORTH EVERY PENNY.  </li>
      <li>so it permits us to keep them all alive when possible.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend either the Generic Helping Hand or the Ez2care: the former is flimsy and lacks gripping power, the latter has jaws that that do not work well with small objects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It needs about an inch and a half of space (and maybe a little more to open up the grabber).</li>
      <li>I ditto the other positive reviews for the Grappler, especially for field and yard work.  </li>
      <li>Does not pinch super hard</li>
      <li>It works very well and provides a tight grip.</li>
      <li>Beat ever Trash tool picks up large heavy items with ease.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sturdy device shouldlast for a while</li>
    <li> I ordered this for picking up around the yard, especially those branches that fall from the trees during a wind storm. This is simply great. I should have ordered 2- one for the inside of the house as well. My wife keeps using this one, and my neighbors want to borrow it.</li>
    <li> I ditto the other positive reviews for the Grappler, especially for field and yard work.  The Grappler tool is made from heavier, stronger materials than most reaching tools.  If you need to handle larger objects or those over a pound or two, this is the device.</li>
    <li> Bought this to pick up trash along rip rap, gets into small places and does the trick for our needs.</li>
    <li> I have the 40 inch for my 6&#x27;2\\&quot; son who picks up trash on commercial properties for a job.  I bought a 33 inch for me (5&#x27;9\\&quot;) for use in the home to reach items on high shelves and deep cabinets.  Since I started it  using outdoors as well to retrieve items in the shrubbery and pick  up trash at the local food bank parking lot as a volunteer, I wanted another one.  This grabber easily picks up the smallest pieces of paper, cigarette butts, and large items like  bottles.  I used it to retrieve a water filter from the bottom of a pond. I wish I had one years ago for the kitchen.  It is so much safer than using a step stool.</li>
    <li> Well built and durable.  I use it to pick up rocks while mowing my rural &amp;#34;lawn&amp;#34;.  I keep it in a 5 gal bucket on the back of my mower.</li>
    <li> If you have a bad back or any other disability this is the tool for you. I put a small screw in the stationary part to secure items like wood to hold it better. Works great and is heavy duty enough to pick up lumber and any other item .</li>
    <li> Not the best of quality. Metal parts are very thin and therefore bend easily.  Nylon/plastic parts are fragile. Spring mechanism is not robust at all! Will not last too long, I am sure!</li>
    <li> My husband broke two of the flimsy medical reachers. We got one of these, and it works much better for him as he recovers from hip and spine surgeries. He did have to epoxy the rubber tips on--they kept falling off. He liked it so well, we got him a second one so he can leave them in the areas he most often uses them.</li>
    <li> Not the flimsy, suction cup grabbers I have had in the past.  This is a rigid, strong grabber that I can use to take cans of the top shelf without the fear of getting hurt,  The plastic grippers make it a safe, as does the strength of the grip.  I use this for anything that is out of reach.  Wish I had found it years ago!</li>
    <li> Got this to handle random critters and bugs and reptiles our cats bring to us in tribute. Does not pinch super hard so it permits us to keep them all alive when possible.</li>
    <li> Beat ever Trash tool picks up large heavy items with ease. Tough &amp; durable. You can order replacement parts making for esay repairs.</li>
    <li> I am handicapped and it is painful for me to reach to the floor to pick up something. This allows me to do that now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for four months now and I just love it!  It is very sturdy and can handle a good amount of weight.  I use it for dumpster d......er recycling ;-)</li>
    <li> have not used this yet. Will be using it for a rattlesnake grabber when one comes to close.. And the season is just starting.</li>
    <li> This is the best! I love it and I am a happy customer!</li>
    <li> Very helpful tool around the house and the yard.  It is an indispenasble tool in helping me keeping the yard clean.  Very handy picking up trash along the road.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It does what it says it will do...within reason. This is the only long handled grabber tool that I have purchased that really does do a good job of helping get what I need done. I trust it in most instances. I have not tried to pick up anything very heavy. Still, it has done a stellar job so far when I needed it.</li>
    <li> This grabber is the strongest I&#x27;ve ever seen.  It&#x27;s also light and easy to use.  I have picked up a dime as well as taking semi-heavy things down from shelfs. Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I love this tool and just bought my second one.  My only complaint was that the jaws would not close tight enough to pick up twigs, but I fixed that issue by adding some foam inside the jaws and now it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This grab it stick is extremely useful.  It has difficulty with getting around fine objects, like a single piece of paper.  But the rubberized clasps make sure you aren&#x27;t going to damage what you are grabbing.  Overall it gives a solid level of control and a good grip.  We use the darned thing whenever something falls between the desk and the wall.  It needs about an inch and a half of space (and maybe a little more to open up the grabber).</li>
    <li> The gripper would not pick up items. It would no close all the way. It was defective. I was going to return it, but Amazon said to keep it and they would refund my money.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC. Bought two and looking forward to lots of use. Rubber on grippers will even pick up pet hair!!!</li>
    <li> I ALREADY HAD 4 DIFFERENT PICKUP TOOLS.  ALL WERE DIFFERENT AND HAD VARIOUS STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES (MORE WEAKNESSES THAN STRENGTHS) AND NONE COULD HANDLE ANYTHING HEAVIER THAN ~1 POUND SO WHEN I NEEDED ANOTHER PICKUP TOOL FOR USE IN MY GARAGE I CHOSE THE &amp;#34;GRAPPLER&amp;#34; AND I AM SO HAPPY THAT I DID!  IT IS A LITTLE BIT PRICEY BUT WORTH EVERY PENNY.  IT EXCELS AT PICKING UP HEAVIER OBJECTS AND HANDLES THE SMALL THINGS TOO.  THE ONLY THING IS HAS PROBLEMS WITH ARE SHALLOW ITEMS LIKE A SINGLE PIECE OF PAPER AND CREDIT CARDS.  I AM THINKING ABOUT REPLACING SOME OF MY CHEAPER PICKUP TOOLS WITH MORE &amp;#34;GRAPPLERS&amp;#34;.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE &amp;#34;GRAPPLER&amp;#34;.  BUY IT - YOU&#x27;LL LIKE IT!</li>
    <li> I have written a review of Pikstik before. It was not a positive review. I asked at the time what a better choice would be. I have found it here at Amazon. It is called the Grappler. Take a look at it. It is so strong! I use it in the yard for picking up all kinds of debris. It is almost entirely made of metal. So that alone makes it last longer. The only drawback I can possibly think of is that it cannot do delicate chores like picking up a dime on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;The grippers or blades or whatever they are called, are metal, flat and wide. I can even pull weeds out of the ground with it. If you want a lightweight one to have with you in the house by your chair, then something else would do that better. But if you want a heavy-duty, trustworthy reacher which will last a very long time, then try this one..the Grappler.</li>
    <li> I never realized how many times during the day I have to bend until I came home from back surgery. I found this item on-line and I&#x27;m so glad! It is a huge help while my husband is at work. For example, I don&#x27;t have to wait for him to pick up the cat bowl, the laundry, pulling the chain on the ceiling fan, grabbing a bottle of water to drink, removing a pot from under the counter and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you. It&#x27;s a great tool, built well and your service is quick!</li>
    <li> I have had the inexpensive grabbers from years ago that I bought at drug store (as seen on TV products).  I wanted something sturdier because that one fell apart.  So I ordered this.  Way too heavy and didn&#x27;t pick up small things like a dropped pices of paper or a small object off floor.Hard to squeeze to get pronges together.  Easy return and got credit from seller with no problem.  Got a great one at Walgreens made by Medline MDS86031RCE-light appears sturdy and works well in cane section for same price range as this one.</li>
    <li> I have the 33&amp;#34; and 40&amp;#34; Grapplers which both work great.  Grappler&#x27;s are both strong and convenient.  Grapplers come in a variety of lengths from 24&amp;#34; to 96&amp;#34;. I use my Grappler for outside work and the heavier work in my garage/workshop. It works very well and provides a tight grip. Ergonomics is not the strong point of the Grappler, strength and durability is.  Although you can&#x27;t see from the photo, the Grappler is not a &amp;#34;cabled&amp;#34; gripper - it&#x27;s solid metal.  It&#x27;s the strongest gripper I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have the Ettore Grip &#x27;n Grab ($20.79 @ Amazon), an Unger 92134 36&amp;#34; Nifty Nabber ($19.97), a Generic Folding Helping Hand ($6.21), and a Ez2care Aluminum Reacher ($10.80). Of all four, my preference for light-duty in home use is the is the Ettore, but this Grappler and the Unger are also great. I would not recommend either the Generic Helping Hand or the Ez2care: the former is flimsy and lacks gripping power, the latter has jaws that that do not work well with small objects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about the Ettore is the swivel end and comfortable handle. It grips well, but not quite as well as the Grappler and Unger. Of them all, the Grappler has the strongest grab, but is the least convenient for me to use around the house. It uses a pistol grip which is harder on arthritic hands. The Unger uses a reverse &amp;#34;handbrake&#x27; design with the pivot at the end of the handle where most of the gripping strength seems to come from the first two fingers - which is ok. The Ettore uses a handbrake design which is the easiest for me to use. The Unger is a bit easier to use to pick up small objects - like coins - than the Ettore. I don&#x27;t need a gripper much for that, so I prefer the ergonomics of the Ettore to the accurate gripping of the Unger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Unger is between the Ettore and Grappler in terms of sturdiness, It applies more force than the Ettore, and also has more angular and aggressive pads. But it lacks the swivel jaws and is not a good ergonomically as the Ettore. I use my Unger in the garage and workshop where I&#x27;m grabbing heavier objects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For use in the home, the Ettore is hard to beat. However, unlike the Unger and Grappler, the gripping mechanism on the Ettore is made of plastic so it is not as well suited for picking up heavy objects or objects that require a great deal of gripping force. I think that the Ettore, Grappler, and Unger are all good products and I&#x27;m pleased with them all - they are individually better at some applications than others. I have no hesitation in recommending any one of them - depending on your needs. If you need strong gripping for heavy objects (things like power tools, paint cans, etc), get the Grappler (bigger jaws) or Unger (smaller jaws). If you need accurate gripping of small objects, get the Unger.  For general purpose comfortable light-duty home use for picking up clothes, pill bottles, and the occasional shoe, consider the Ettore.e Ettore.

    <li> Quite simply it works and is durable. Purchased two of these for my aging father. One he keeps indoors the other outdoors. He uses his every day and both are still working flawlessly after a couple years worth of use.</li>
    <li> After having had products like this become difficult to use, I bought this at a price at least 50% higher than most. But you know what? They work well for picking us the smallest twig or branch off the lawn. As a test I tried to pick up a dime off a wood floor. It took three tries, but I was successful. Try that with a cheaper grappler.</li>
    <li> I bought this primarily to retrieve socks that fall behind the dryer, then discovered it&#x27;s also the perfect way to reach the ceiling fan chains on my 10-ft ceilings! I decided on this Grappler after looking at a number of brands; I liked its construction and durability, and felt it was a good value. It has certainly lived up to my expectations!</li>
    <li> I bought this grabber and a similar sized one from BuyDirect2You Reacher because of the different methods of grabbing.  This is my personal preference 55 to 45 because of the straight and &amp;#34;L&amp;#34; shaped ends.  It can be used as a temporary cane if you&#x27;re careful, yet my favorite is shopping in a grocery store and grabbing items above head height.&lt;br /&gt;Well made, sturdy.</li>
    <li> I use this almost everyday for either picking things up or reaching something on a high shelf.</li>
    <li> I have a 33\\&quot; &amp; just purchased a 40\\&quot;.  Best product available as a &#x27;pick-up&#x27; tool.&lt;br /&gt;Good material, well constructed &amp; easy to use.  Have adapted tool by sharpening the&lt;br /&gt;tip for use to cut root of weed when does not easily pull up.  Use the tool primarily&lt;br /&gt;for pulling small weeds, especially in mulch beds.  Parts are available &amp; has a great&lt;br /&gt;warranty.  Read up on products at Grapplersinc.com.</li>
    <li> This device is great.  I used it for a neighborhood cleanup day to pick up everything from bits of paper to clothes and bottles.  It handled everything with ease and saved my back from repetitive bending.</li>
    <li> This is the best picker upper I&#x27;ve ever owned, it picks up any and everything!!</li>
    <li> Exactly as I had hoped. I use it to pick up sticks in my yard.  Saves my back and my legs.</li>
    <li> This pickup tool is far superior to any of it&#x27;s competitors.  I have tried other pickup tools but this is the best.  I have been using two others for several years and have been quite satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have two and find them a great help. I keep on in the kitchen and the other in the bedroom.</li>
    <li> The junky things they sell nowadays labeled \\&quot;Grabbers\\&quot; are just not at ALL what they used to be. Compared to them, this thing ia a Mac truck compared to a Datsun! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This grappler is fantastic........ It appears to be well made...........seems to be industrial strength in terms of usage. Compared to other similar products I have owned/used, this one is by far, the BEST !</li>
