<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> awsome stuff and received it fast</li>
    <li> Obsessed with these bath salts.</li>
    <li> High quality and soothes my bath time. I also use it as a final rinse for my dig wit skin problems.</li>
    <li> I love this sea salt.  It makes skin silky soft when used in a bath.  Also wonderful for foot soaks, leaving feet ready for summer sandals.  Also use it as a general exfoliant.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Using every 2nd or 3rd day and is making significant difference in controlling my psoriasis as I am unable to take any medication for the problem.</li>
    <li> Used it last night and I slept like a bby!! Been suffering from itchiness for 6 months and finally I have true relief!!!!!!!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product. AMAZING :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Cured my scalp dermatitis issue of over10 years. Yes...I washed my hair with Minera Dead Sea Salt and shampoo and POOF!....problem solved in about 4 washes.</li>
    <li> Great resource to have at home in case you would ever need it!</li>
    <li> I have used this 5lb bag of salt faithfully, and I am getting down to the last of it. I Absolutely Love It!!! Thank you for an amazing product. I will definitely be ordering again really soon.</li>
    <li> Great value and I love the product!</li>
    <li> Bought a 5 pound bag to use as part of a body wash.  No issues...breaks down easy.</li>
    <li> Although the packaging was thick plastic mine arrived with a hole in the bag causing salt to be everywhere in the box, I had to immediately put the salt in a big ziplock bag to keep it contained otherwise arrived as expected!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo36S0OBAEPV1NT]]I decided to have a relaxing bath last night and threw a handful of Minera Dead Sea Salt into the water. Perhaps it was just the thought, but after I was through I did feel thoroughly relaxed. Mind you, if you want to work on a psoriasis problem, you&#x27;d use a full two pounds and soak in a warm bath for twenty minutes. The outlined \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; dictates that you&#x27;d do this three or four times a week for four weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spas do use this salt as a scrub, but do charge a pretty hefty price for it. Why bother when you can use it at home for a minimal cost in comparison? If you want to use it as a scrub, simply use a small amount after bathing and rub it into your skin. When you are done, simply rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The San Francisco Salt Company uses \\&quot;Certified 100% authentic, pure &amp; natural and the exact same salts as used in the spas and treatment centers around the Dead sea in Israel. Minera Dead Sea Salt not been processed or refined here in the U.S. We sell only the highest quality Dead Sea salts on the market today.\\&quot; Can&#x27;t get much better than that and the price is certainly right.&lt;br /&gt;BENEFITS OF MINERA DEAD SEA SALT:&lt;br /&gt;► Magnesium: Promotes healing of skin tissue and provides skin surface with anti-allergic element.&lt;br /&gt;Essential for cell metabolism.&lt;br /&gt;► Bromide: Soothes skin, relaxes body muscles, and tranquilizes nerves.&lt;br /&gt;► Sulfur: A natural disinfectant (constituent of certain vitamins).&lt;br /&gt;► Potassium: A moisture regulator that maintains a neutral environment in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;► Calcium: A building block for corrective tissue under the skin surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;► Sodium: Relieves stiffness and muscle cramps and maintains neutral environment in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHEMICAL ANALYSIS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;► Magnesium Chloride: 31 - 35%&lt;br /&gt;► Potassium Chloride 20.0 - 28%&lt;br /&gt;► Sodium chloride: 3.0 - 8%&lt;br /&gt;► Calcium Chloride: 0.1% - 0.5%&lt;br /&gt;► Bromide: 0.3 - 0.6%&lt;br /&gt;► Sulphates: 0 - 0.3%&lt;br /&gt;► Insolubles: 0 - 0.3%&lt;br /&gt;► Water of Crystallization: 32.0 - 40.0%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT DETAILS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;► Product: Untreated Dead Sea Salt&lt;br /&gt;► Importer: San Francisco Salt Company&lt;br /&gt;► Port of loading: Haifa&lt;br /&gt;► Origin: Israel&lt;br /&gt;► Classification: Untreated Mineral salt&lt;br /&gt;► Color: Natural white&lt;br /&gt;► Odor: Natural metallic mineral smell due to the high composition of minerals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review./&gt;► Water of Crystallization: 32.0 - 40.0%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT DETAILS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;► Product: Untreated Dead Sea Salt&lt;br /&gt;► Importer: San Francisco Salt Company&lt;br /&gt;► Port of loading: Haifa&lt;br /&gt;► Origin: Israel&lt;br /&gt;► Classification: Untreated Mineral salt&lt;br /&gt;► Color: Natural white&lt;br /&gt;► Odor: Natural metallic mineral smell due to the high composition of minerals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> Fast, reasonable in price.  This is perfect for my mom for her arthritis.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have purchased the fine dead sea salts. I really like them. I would recommend them. I think they dissolve quicker on my skin when I use them as a scrub.</li>
    <li> After using it once I saw it had a strange texture and strange sediments. Just to test it I dissolved it in water to taste it, and it didn&#x27;t even taste salty! It&#x27;s got a horrible chemical taste. I&#x27;m returning this. Not the real thing at all.</li>
    <li> Caution this product may give you the clear beautiful tight feeling skin that you&#x27;ve always wanted. (:</li>
    <li> Used it to make bath salts. Exactly what I needed. Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the quality.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for to use for my seborrheic dermatitis. Also using this as a body exfoliant. Super effective and at a great price!</li>
    <li> Great for a taking away sore muscles. Beware for those that aren&#x27;t chemistry savvy: DON&amp;#34;T mix with Epsom salt and baking soda. I tried to make my own homemade bath soak mixing these minerals together and it turned into a solid brick that won&#x27;t dissolve at all. Just use this salt by itself.</li>
    <li> Love. Love. Love.  Great product and dissolves FAST!!</li>
    <li> I use this salt to take salt baths, and it is great, and very effective for health purposes. For this use, it is better than Bob Mill&#x27;s sea salt that I tried before.</li>
    <li> These mineral salts are good ones.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic product. Use in our bath and also just as face wash. Leaves skin feeling clean freah. Will be buying again very soon.</li>
    <li> I really like this for soaking sore muscles and also dissolving some in a bowl and splashing on my face if my Rosacea has an itchy flare up. It really helps soothe and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
    <li> After spending many hours of cycling and climbing the beautiful mountains in the SF Bay area, or pounding the pavement / trails, or pushing yourself in the pool or open water swim, a soak in the tub with these Dead Sea Salt - magnesium flakes, mixed with some sea salt and some essential oils is a heavenly experience. Gets you ready for the next workout. Rejuvenating. Fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order from the SF Bath Salt Company was promptly delivered and packaged well. Great product and service. Will order again!</li>
    <li> Love this salt. I use this in herbal bath teas and use it as an EO carrier.</li>
    <li> After reading several reviews about how Mineral Dead Sea Salt helps psoriasis, I decided to order it.  I suffer from severe dandruff and a very itchy, oily scalp and have unsuccessfully tried many so-call remedies, even prescriptions.  It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks now. I&#x27;ve been mixing this salt in with my usual shampoo twice a week, leaving it on for about 5 minutes, then rinsing.  I also mix it with my body soap once a week to exfoliate.  The acne on my face and chest is actually going away and my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch anymore. It really works - and without awful chemicals!  And as always, very soothing for sore muscles in the bath.  Will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> I ordered this salt back in January because I have problems with dry skin in the winter.  After soaking in a salt bath, using these salts, my skin felt noticeably better and less itchy.  I am very happy with this product, and if that&#x27;s not great enough, five months later the San Francisco Salt Company sent me a free sample of pink Himalayan gourmet salt, which is my favorite salt to cook with!  Fantastic products and company!</li>
    <li> Just great, far exceeded the list office delivery mess up. They made it right, thanks!</li>
    <li> Amazing.  There is nothing better.  This heals the skin like nothing else.  If you want an added treat use both this and Redmond clay in an evening bath.</li>
    <li> i bathe my 10 month old son with a cup of this in the water and i don&#x27;t understand how it works.... but it drastically helps to clear up his eczema! Its amazing!! love this stuff!!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect Just what I needed for my bathbombs... Thank you</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, rough skin. I do not have any medical conditions but dryness causes my skin to itch and break out a lot. Being me, I tend to scratch a lot and my acne/bumps leave scars on my skin. I was not a believer in salt therapy but it works. I have no idea why but it does. My skin feels softer and less irritating. I scratch 90% less than before and my skin isn&#x27;t as dry as it used to be. This salt makes me feel so peaceful and calm. I used to scratch my legs in my sleep and would wake up with nasty burns from all the scratching. But now I sleep sound.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. Very helpful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided without any obligations.</li>
    <li> Dead sea salt has always helped with my arthritis. I add it to some water and let my feet and hands soak in it. Perfect addition to my baths. This large bulk bag will last! The product is exactly as listed, 100% certified pure and organic. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I use the dead sea salt to create a face mask (some lotion + sea salt) to exfoliate and get rid of seborrheic dermatitis . I tend to get dry red patches on my face due to the sd; and once I do a mask almost immediately I notice that it lessens and disappears. Usually within the week, the spots are all gone. I find that if I don&#x27;t regularly do it (a couple times a week) sometimes the patches will return.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the psoriasis on my leg and feet, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement after 3 uses but it is soothing. I am hoping it will improve my condition and time will tell.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this.  It is calming, relaxing, and healing for the skin.</li>
    <li> Why is there little brown rocks in it? Its ok after straining i guess</li>
    <li> The person I got it for is using it but it is too soon to see results. We read in the paper that it helps to remove warts on bottom of feet. Since I don&#x27;t results yet I cannot correctly rate the product.</li>
    <li> Bath salts work well as far as I can tell. I enjoyed and the package arrived when it said it would.</li>
    <li> After much research I decided to try Minerva Dead Sea Salt. At first, I was a bit concerned about the price as it is significantly cheaper than some other amazon options. But don&#x27;t be deterred! The product is great both in quality and quantity. It almost feels like the Dead Sea and unlike some other products I have not head any irritation after using it.</li>
    <li> This salt arrived in good time and the product met my expectations.  My muscles feel quite relaxed after a nice soak with these Dead Sea salts.</li>
    <li> I purchased the fine grain Dead Sea Salt crystals having received no encouraging news from my dermatologist that the sebhorrheic dermatitis which was residing on my face, would ever settle down or be easier to live with. I took the lead and did some searching for holistic/natural methods and found that using this salt as a face wash demonstrated a large improvement. I was willing to give anything a try that didn&#x27;t involve prescription medication/steroids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised and extremely excited to see the redness reduce and the burning subside. I use CeraVae wash to cleans my skin followed by a warm solution of water and Dead Sea Salt crystal splashed over the affected areas, then rinse with clear water; pat my skin dry and then if any scaling or tight feeling patches I use a think coat of Aveeno Eczema Relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been following this regimen since late 2014. Sometimes my skin is so clear the SD seems like it&#x27;s completely cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My satisfaction with the Dead Sea Salt crystals has been exceeded. Thank you San Francisco Bath Salt Company for &amp;#34;saving&amp;#34; my skin!</li>
    <li> It is common knowledge that in addition to being the largest land-locked &amp;#34;sea,&amp;#34; the Dead Sea is not only several meters below sea level, it only has water flow into the sea, and no flow out of the sea. However, as interesting as investigating the characteristics of the Dead Sea might be, the usual reason for acquiring a bag of mineral salt is (normally) to languish in a warm bath and let the day&#x27;s stress recede. After a history of lacing the bath water with everything from &amp;#34;bath salt&amp;#34; to Epsom salt I am convinced that the myriad minerals that make up the salt of the Dead Sea are tremendously more effective. Try it--You will probably like it as I do.</li>
    <li> It came on time, was very easy to use and is AUTHENTIC from the actual Dead Sea, which I find has great salt grains. Easy and good service.</li>
    <li> I like it but wish they had the medium grain maybe. Felt like I needed a heavier grain for my body scrubs.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve been Adovia&#x27;s loose sea salt as a facial scrub (it&#x27;s great for stressed out, sensitive skin), but the last batch was clumpy and a little oily and smelled &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; so I decided it was time to shop around. I&#x27;ve used SF Salt Company food salts and they are great, so I decided to give the Dead Sea Salts for face/body a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These salts are WONDERFUL. They are clean, snow-white, fresh, and the grain is perfect- not so fine that they dissolve instantly, but not large enough that they scrape your skin off. And the bag is quite large- much larger than the jars I have been purchasing. It&#x27;s resealable, so I just poured some of the salt into a little plastic container and keep that in the shower. I store the rest under the cabinet, so it stays fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels so fresh and *clean* after using these salts. I simply mix a little with my facial cleanser, and then scrub it into my skin. The salt exfoliates and then dissolves completely, and it makes my skin smooth and squeaky clean without stripping it like harsh chemical cleaners can. It also prevents breakouts and gets rid of any dry spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sea Salt is great for the skin, and Dead Sea Salt seems to be the best. Forget about the other brands and the pre-made scrubs, just buy a bag of these and you&#x27;ll be set for great skin for a long time. I&#x27;m so happy!</li>
    <li> my wife use this for her skin condition and says its great.</li>
    <li> I use this to add to my bath water as an aid for my skin.  It is very relaxing. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but you have to be careful about how much salt you add to the water.  You only need two handfuls to a full bath.  The salt comes in a sturdy plastic bag with a ziploc seal.  So far, so good.  I always feel relaxed and calm after a soak with the Minera Dead Sea salt.</li>
    <li> This stuff is not real. It&#x27;s Epsom salt or something. I&#x27;ve used Dead Sea products and I&#x27;ve used the salt by itself and this is not it. This stuff almost made me vomit. The taste is nowhere near natural. I use it as a mouth wash and wanted to try this brand. Never ever ever again. Doesn&#x27;t make a good scrub either. I make my own body products and Dead Sea salt is an ingredient I use. I&#x27;d give it no stars if I could. Buy at your own risk.</li>
    <li> Smelled good to me, but my wife hated the smell.  Didnt accomplish what I was hoping with my Sebhhoric Dermatitis.  Hard for me to really rate the product because it wasnt the manufacturers promise that failed.</li>
    <li> I usually use the crystal salt, and it dissolves very well, but I got a new acrylic tub and didn&#x27;t want to take a chance on salt damage.  This does not dissolve as well.  When I was done with my long soak, there were still salt crystals on the bottom of the tub.  Maybe it&#x27;s me....but next time it&#x27;s back to crystals.</li>
    <li> all good no problems-thanks</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Now when I take a Epsom salt bath I&#x27;m groggy and tired the next day when I do this sea salt bath 20 mins I sleep awesome&lt;br /&gt; And the next morning no trouble waking up and full of energy. I will reorder. I love when amazon has items in stock and try ship they r the best, fast so I look at that too not just the seller but who&#x27;s is shipping.</li>
    <li> After perusing the internet for salt scrubs, I couldn&#x27;t get myself to spend the amount of money they were asking for a small container of it. I decided to look up recipes to make my own. I ordered from the San Francisco Bath Salt Company. Minera Dead Sea Salt arrived in a timely fashion and I was able to concoct some natural and wonderfully scented salt scrubs at a fraction of the cost as the ones offered online. I used essential oils, almond oil for the base, and the minera sea salt. It was easy and the scrub made my skin glow without being too abrasive. It was just the right level of exfoliation. I would absolutely recommend this salt. Dealing with this company was a pleasure.</li>
    <li> It cleans my face up great but the taste when it gets in your mouth is nasty. I thought this was the same product I used before that had that &amp;#34;salt&amp;#34; taste to it. This just is nope! Hate using it for fear of it getting in my mouth but it cleans the face which I guess is why I wanted it.</li>
    <li> A lot of salt in a small bag! I have ordered this salt after a long trip overseas with excursions that lead to muscle pain, legs, thighs, buttocks, back pain to the point that I was unable to walk or seat on a chair - including padded chairs because the pain was excruciating. I have used a large amount of the salt on very warm water and soaked for 30 minutes for 3 days and voila! The bag is tightly packed with salt. There is still 3/4 of the bag left for soaks during those lousy winter months that tend to flare up old injuries. The soaks reduce muscle spasms and alleviate pain.</li>
    <li> Good price, good product, timely delivery - I don&#x27;t have any complaints. will be reordering</li>
    <li> Great product, works well as ingredient in other things . Love the way it smells &amp; feels.</li>
    <li> I use it for soaking in the tub.  I use it in combination with menthol and wintergreen for lower back pain. Truly enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product one time and already see results. I have guttate psoriasis so I break out every few years and although mine is already clearing on it&#x27;s own I can definitely see how people with chronic psoriasis love this stuff. It did sting my psoriasis spots but that only lasted a minute or two. Lets face it it&#x27;s salt there will be a stinging sensation in spots that aren&#x27;t normal skin. However, I immediately noticed that my skin was unbelievably smooth. There was no drying but I did put a lotion on afterwards. I used BWC lotion which is perfume free etc. as although people with psoriasis are supposed to use HEAVY moisturizers I can not because the greasy feeling irritates my skin. bwc is a thick moisturizer that is not greasy  so the sea salt and lotion mix was like heaven for my skin. I am very excited to see results after a week of tanning and sea salt baths. Also my skin has a nice glow to it and I can run my fingers across my psoriasis spots and it feels like normal skin no irritation. As an added note I did extensive heavy research on which brand of sea salt to buy. I&#x27;m happy to say I picked the right company to purchase from because the salt is the real deal! Look no where else if you one the real deal this is it.</li>
    <li> Not sure who killed it, but this dead salt works great. Hope no salt suffered in the making of this product.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Makes you feel like jelly after sitting in for about an hour.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the quality of the product. Plan on using it as a nasal rinse has recommended by health professionals.  Your company was highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Nice clean, white salt just as pictured.  Sturdily packaged.  An excellent bath salt that I include in my own mix.  It is a great soak that I should do more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
    <li> I ordered this sea salt to make a salt rub for some christmas gifts and it is just the right size granules so that is is not too abrasive on the skin but does what you want it to when mixed in the proper proportions with a carrier oil.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product twice a week for three weeks now. I cannot tell for certain if it helps, but it just might. My legs skin looks a bit better, maybe. There is not harm using it that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> great but keep the bag (or salts) in a container - so the natural oils don&#x27;t leech out.</li>
    <li> My almost 3 year old daughter suffers from SEVERE Eczema. (Chronic staph infections from scratching) We have been to several dermatologists, and have tried about all the steroid creams available. Someone told me to try Dead Sea Salt to help. I laughed it off and thought, &amp;#34;No way will that help&amp;#34; Boy was I wrong. I tried her first bath (just a few days ago) with a half cup of the salt added to her warm bathwater. She cried with the thought of getting in the tub. She needed a good soak though. Less than 2 minutes in the water she stopped crying, she said &amp;#34;Ohh mom that feels good&amp;#34; and began pouring the water over her head. She hadn&#x27;t played and laughed in a bath for almost 2 years. I cried. We followed the 20 minute soak/play time with a good moisturizer (Think Avocado butter) to lock in the moisture and minerals. 7 hours later, she was still NOT SCRATCHING!!!!! She didn&#x27;t start scratching for over 24 hours later. In which we followed up with another soak in the tub. (Same routine.) No crying, no scratching, no fussing. I am so happy. Thanks so much for delivering a FABULOUS product. A little less stress on this mom&#x27;s shoulders.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality sea salt and can be used for so many things. I mixed it with coconut oil and rubbed it on my skin and got a great exfoliation from it.</li>
    <li> Used this to make Citrus bath soak. It not only worked perfectly, but using it is really nice. It makes the water very soft and your skin feels so nice</li>
    <li> I followed the direction of some others &amp; did not add this to very hot water. Supposedly very hot water breaks down the salt &amp; it&#x27;s healing properties. I use this about every 10 days, in a luke warm bath. Feels very clean afterwards. Great for exfoliating &amp; making my skin feel great.</li>
    <li> Nice clean salt that dissolves well in the bath. Well  packaged in a heavy duty, resealable bag. I purchased the 5 lb bag, but next time I will get the 10 lb bag. Good price and quality!</li>
    <li> I have used epsom salts by the same company.  I had read a review by someone that has major skin problems and recommended trying this.  I am sold!  I have chronic dryness with some body acne from time to time.  My 5 year old son also has some skin issues as well with dryness and acne.  I am sold on this.  The smell of the salt did bother me at first, but I do believe that this has improved my skin over empsom salts.  I use a couple handfuls for myself and one for my son.  It does take time to see any skin improvement; however, the body acne seems to appear to be clearing up very quickly!  Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis and I started product on Friday and continued 30 minute soaks in 1 cup salt and luke warm water every night. The itch is almost gone. The flakes are gone but I still have red marks. I&#x27;m hopeful if I continue they will go away too. I soak at night, pat dry and leave skin alone overnight. In morning I take shower and use lotion moderately. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different. I also find this product to work on my face which is oily with occasional breakouts.</li>
    <li> I bought it for making scrubs for Christmas presents, and and to make clarifying shampoo and it&#x27;s the perfect grain size, and great quality.</li>
    <li> fast shipper...thankyou&lt;br /&gt;feels great, works great I enjoy immensely, cost is good for the amount and is worth buying , great on the skin</li>
    <li> I totally love this product. My skin felt amazing after using it. I am definitely buying more in the the future!</li>
    <li> We mix this with other stuff and it does the job on the body.  We recommend it to anyone wanting to work their skin.</li>
    <li> these are cheaper than the salts I used to buy and works just the same.  I can add my own essential oils when using it in the bath.  This is a large bag and lasts quite a long time.</li>
    <li> Great price for the amount you get! I use this for a my home made body scrub for Keratosis Pilaris, and it is the ONLY thing that has significantly helped my KP. Will be purchasing again when I run out!</li>
    <li> I love the quality of this salt and use it regularly in hot baths, for health reasons.  This is a good value, for the price and a good company that I feel good about ordering from.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use this to make bath salts and they came out great.</li>
    <li> I ordered bath salt by mistake.  When I inquired about using it for table salt, they informed me that it wasn&#x27;t food grade.  Since it was my mistake, I didn&#x27;t try to return the wrong salt.  However, San Francisco Bath Salt Company offered to send me some table salt.  I just received a generous amount of Sherpa Pink Himalayan Salt.  It is 100% pure and natural salt and of such good quality.  The San Francisco Bath Salt Company went way beyond any service that I would have expected and I certainly will do business with them in the future.  Thank you so much San Francisco Bath Salt Company.</li>
    <li> I read the post on Dead Sea salt removing warts and thought, \\&quot;What the heck. May as well try it.\\&quot;  I truly did try everything else i.e. bananas, duct tape, Compound W, freezing, dermatologist using laser as well as freezing, scraping.  So I tried the Dead Sea salt.  A couple of baths and they started to recede. I had warts on my fingers and feet.  I only took a couple baths a week with the salt so it truly was not a hassle. I put 6 spoonfuls into the tub and soaked for about 15-20 min.  Now the warts are GONE!!  I don&#x27;t know if 6 was overloading it but I kept with it.  Now I only take a bath (with the salt) once a week, if that.  Still gone.</li>
    <li> used this to make salt scrub and it turned out Great</li>
    <li> Really helps, if not eliminates, my psoriasis...can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis, which mostly affects the back of my head and behind my right ear.  I have suffered with this for the past three years.  Horrible itching, irritated skin, and constant flaking.  I had consulted a dermatologist who prescribed Elidel, which would relieve the itching for a few hours, at most.  After complaining about my condition this week, my wife took it upon herself and did some research on the Internet and found many people who also suffer with this condition attesting to the relief they found by using Dead Sea salts.  I must admit that I was highly skeptical and even laughed when she told me that she had purchased some for me to try.  After applying it the first time and then using Aveeno&#x27;s Pure Renewal shampoo, I noticed a marked difference in the itching.  Now, after five days of use, I can honestly say that I am amazed and elated.  The itching is totally gone and the flaking is non-existent. Even the skin irritation has almost totally disappeared.  Totally Great Product!!!</li>
    <li> I use this at night to soak my feet. I had a foot injury and used this extensively for weeks. Prior to using this, I wasn&#x27;t healing very quickly. After I started using dead sea salt, it healed very rapidly. Maybe my foot benefited from all the minerals and it sped up the healing. I&#x27;m not sure, but I&#x27;m certainly going to order more.</li>
    <li> I recommeded this to my brother who suffers from Sebaceous Dermatitis after doing some internet research.  He had already spent a small fortune on prescription medications that his doctor prescribed.  None of the expensive medications worked.  He was skeptical that the sea salt would work but he had nothing to lose.  Well, he is now a true believer.  His face starting gradually clearing in a week or so.  After two months there is no sign of it except a small scar.  He still uses it every day just in case the rash might return.  He does not use it as a scrub but instead dilutes some salt in warm water, then soaks his skin for a few minutes using a wash cloth.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face. Put a small quantity in a tiny dish, add hot water, stir to dissolve, then use a cotton swab to apply to  breakouts of seborhheic dermatitis, psoriasis, etc and allow to dry.  I leave it on overnight.</li>
    <li> My second purchase. I have had bad skin forever. I had used Epsom salts for years to soak my feet. Then a friend told me about soaking in the Dead Sea. Since I could not go to the Sea, I looked for the salts. Found these on Amazon. I was amazed at how good my feet felt after soaking with the salts. So a few days later, I filled the tub and added about a cup of the salts. WONDERFUL!!! Not only did it relax me, my skin was clear of any of the scaly patches that I had had. And it lasted for over a week. I&#x27;m hooked. This was my second purchase and I am sure there will be more.</li>
    <li> Great quality product that I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I use this in my bath.  It makes my skin feel sooo soft.</li>
    <li> works wonder. Now if i could change my 1.5 yo habit, then she&#x27;d b in good shape...its been working on both kids with SEVERE eczema...I&#x27;ve tried diff. meds recommded by 2 docs &amp; also the skin specialist. It workd 4 a while but came bak once med ran out. so i can&#x27;t keep doing that 2 the kids...their skin need 2 naturally build up. by bathing everyday with this salt, it heals slowly but i could see it...her habit is still there when she fuzzes she&#x27;ll still scratches but its much less...im trying everything i could including feeding her less sugary stuffs if NOT at all...less carpet (major eczema problm), less strong soap (or not at all), less scent lotion (plain or baby oil), hope this help anyone that have the same problm...theres no miracle for babies that fuzzes alot like mine...they won&#x27;t stop if they itch...so u hav 2 stop &#x27;em by lettin &#x27;em play more...Thanks\^^/</li>
    <li> I have used it for seborrheic dermatitis, and it works wonders!  I have used countless other treatments, many prescribed by a very competent dermatologist, and nothing even comes close to the salt treatment.  I learned of it on line and would recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C. Glenn Pickard, Jr., MD</li>
    <li> I use this in my asparagus patch to keep the weeds away.. wonderful product</li>
    <li> Actually still have this.  It is ok</li>
    <li> Just as it promises well see if it works</li>
    <li> I am a 27 yr old male suffering from seb derm and oily skin on and around my nose. I read reviews on how this can help with oily skin and other skin ailments. This for sure helps with my oily skin and does NOT flare up my seb derm. Usually my face is really sensitive to EVERYTHING so i was scared to try this on my face. Also I feel like this helps with acne as well. In a nut shell, this is superb quality dead sea salt as ive tried 3 other brands and its shipped extremely fast. If your skin is really oily and you suffer from acne give this a try. I felt a little weird putting this on my face but its helping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with eczema for 2 years to the point where without medicated cream it looked as of I was burned. But this product. has me medication free! clear healthy skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m making my own scrubs for Christmas gifts, these salts are the perfect consistancy and size, I can&#x27;t wait to get things going</li>
    <li> Brought it for my psarosis used it didnt see any changes but  a day later made it worser...then the bag was so small and I heard such great things about it so I ordered more before using it...now I have unopened 20lb bag of this stuff</li>
    <li> The salt tends to dry my skin out too much, so I have stopped using it.</li>
    <li> Working good so far with just minimal foot soaking and occasional baths.  Pleasant and no bad sulfur smell like some.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of expensive luxury to buy this regularly.  But I love using the bath salts 2-3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Keratosis pilaris all over my arms, and this is one of the few things that I have tried that actually noticeably helps the appearance of my skin.  I&#x27;ve also tried salicylic and glycolic acids but that didn&#x27;t really seem to have any effect.  The only other product that seemed to help minimize my KP was Retin-a (generic name: Tretinoin) a topical cream/gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m only using this 2-3x a week, my skin would probably look even better with daily baths.</li>
    <li> Again, this was a gift for our granddaughter and she had requested it.</li>
    <li> Item is just as described. I bought because of the good reviews already posted . . . and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. It does smell a bit medicinal to me, but it&#x27;s not a bad smell and some bath oils cover the smell rather well.</li>
    <li> Nice bath salt.  Using along with essential oils.</li>
    <li> If you have ecszema, save yourself alot of money by trying this first before purchasing all the expensive smelly creams the doctor&#x27;s office will have you try.  From my own personal experience, get on some kind of anti-bacterial medication prescribed by the doctor for a week and then go home and soak in &amp;#34;dead sea salt&amp;#34; daily for 25-30 minutes and then get some over the counter lotion for dry skin.  The expensive creams did not work on me after spending close to $200 with good insurance.  The dead sea salt has many minerals that soothes the skin.  After being on the doctor prescribed creams for two weeks, it did not have the results the dead sea salt does.  If you don&#x27;t believe me, google &amp;#34;dead sea salt&amp;#34; and you will read about all the minerals contained in this salt.  By soaking  in this for only 2 days, it made the redness go down and now is &amp;#34;all gone!&amp;#34;  I could have bought almost 10, 5 lb. bags for the price I spent on so called creams that did not smell good.  For those desperate and new to ecszema, give this a try before buying the expensive creams.</li>
    <li> 2 nd order ... Says it all, great great product</li>
    <li> This is such an energizing product. Seems to work well on sore muscles and joints too. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great for bath...it soften the water.</li>
    <li> had a grease burn scar on my stomach from a cooking accident. took a bath in sea salt and made a scrub with this as well and it disappeared in like 5 days. BF was amazed. yay!</li>
    <li> Shipped on time, using it in baths for different skin conditions. I like that you can buy it in large quantity. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> Have not used the product yet, but received the item in record time. I ordered this on the advice of my alternative medicine practicioner and expect relief from sore muscles and dry skin!&lt;br /&gt;Good company to deal with.</li>
    <li> Bought this product to try on my grandson who unfortunately has Psoriasis. Much improvement, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  At the recommendation of my Physical Therapist, I&#x27;ve started taking baths.  I decided to start making my own bath salts since the pre-made stuff is prohibitively expensive.  This stuff is a great base for homemade bath salt.  It leaves my skin feeling very nice, and depending on which scent I use with it, it smells nice too.  I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase and will be buying this again</li>
    <li> As advertised, received in a timely manner.  I was using it in a bath for medical purposes and it did what I needed.  I was using two cups a pop and it lasted for six or seven days of baths.</li>
    <li> Salt arrived very quickly in a sturdy resealable pouch and with a great product description card that gives you all the info about the salt you&#x27;d want to know.  The salt has a nice grain (not too coarse or too fine).  I&#x27;m really happy with my order.</li>
    <li> This is fine salt and dissolves easily in warm water.</li>
    <li> Great for relaxing in our hor tub, wife noticed a change in her skin texture very quickly and we are senior citizens. Lives up to its claims</li>
    <li> Little pricy, will just purchase locally</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel after I wash my face with it.  It helps my current condition.</li>
    <li> The San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s Minera Dead Sea Salt is exquisitely relaxing and refreshing. It turns your bath tub into a spa, and the healing effects can be felt after about 20 minutes of letting these amazing salts do their work on your body, detoxifying and also cleansing and exfoliating your skin, so that it is smooth and soft afterwards. You can also use a handful in a foot bath, if you have one of those \\&quot;standing on your feet\\&quot; jobs that cause swelling and pain for your hard-working feet (a foot bath with these salts is also great before giving yourself a pedicure!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the aroma...it&#x27;s like a whiff of the sea...and you can imagine yourself on a boat or relaxing on a beach. This salt is 100% Dead Sea mineral rich salt from Israel, and if you don&#x27;t have time for a nice long soak, sprinkle some on a washcloth or mix with your shower gel, and enjoy a lot of the health benefits while you shower. San Francisco Salt Company bath salts are of amazing high quality for an affordable price. We deserve to feel the best and be the healthiest we can, and a soak in \\&quot;Minera Dead Sea Salt\\&quot; is a very special treat, and a big step in that direction.</li>
    <li> Great product. Only use 1 teaspoon for every liter. Or else it will overdry your face if used on face.</li>
    <li> Is this really sea salt? Seems as though it been mixed with something.&lt;br /&gt;Seems as a good product but as one who uses sea salt on food and Living next to the pacific ocean, I feel as this isn&#x27;t pure.</li>
    <li> After suffering with a skin condition on my face for a while. I ran out of solutions. The topical steroids gave me acne, and the second i stopped using them my face would explode again. This has been the ONLY natural remedy that actually has worked for me. I can&#x27;t tell you how much this is worth buying if you have ANY kind of skin condition. It really works, it burns as much as salt does in a wound. That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s salt. It&#x27;s not pleasant, but it works. HIGGGGHLY recommend. dandruff, acne, it fixes it all. Wash it on, let it sit for 5 minutes, and rinse it off. Follow it up with a oatmeal based lotion. Amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this Sea Salt. The fine grain is the prefect size for facials and body scrubs. This salt is really good for the skin. This is my 2nd time buying this product, and I recommend!</li>
    <li> Nice salt! Makes a great coconut scrub! I bought fine grain in error but glad I did....I think the course grain would have been too abrasive for my skin. It was delivered fast. Pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> I like this Dead Sea salt for my baths. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell as others have noted, but that&#x27;s ok with me as I can add a bit of bubble bath if I want. Good product, ships fast. Like it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to use in making bath salts and it seems to work well.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what color it would be, since I&#x27;ve seen pictures showing quite a variety of color, but this one came nice and white, so it looks nice in the bath salts.</li>
    <li> feels so good in a hot bath relaxing.</li>
    <li> I have had dandruff for years and this is the only thing that has worked</li>
    <li> It added a brown color to the water and remained behind in the bath tub. Required clean up.</li>
    <li> is the real stuff! works wonders</li>
    <li> Used this to make salt scrubs as holiday gifts!  Great quality. I will make salt scrubs a tradition!</li>
    <li> It was awesome. Like it says, not a food salt. Tastes terrible and about a tablespooon will make you real sleepy, so dont eat it.</li>
    <li> Not bad , beneficial to my tsw eczema skin however Natural Planets is a bit less expensive.</li>
    <li> I had long heard about the benefits of Dead Sea salt - my sister has traveled there I believe on more than one occasion and has sent me little samples here and there. It was for this reason (and a few others) that I gladly accepted The San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s free sample of this to try - I did so on the basis that an honest review would be given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes:&lt;br /&gt;- Though not totally apparent here on Amazon, these are directly imported from Israel. Only Israeli and Jordanian salts can be termed \\&quot;Dead Sea Salt\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;- For a bath, you need about one pound of salt, very hot water reduces efficacy&lt;br /&gt;- These salts come with a certificate of authenticity, and I believe SFSC were the first to do so&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am not a doctor, biologist or other type of very smart person, but the following potential benefits have been listed in several locations, including studies from the University of Maryland. Please take a lot of the information on the web (especially in regards to your health) with a grain of salt! I promise, that will be my only salt-related pun,  I wouldn&#x27;t want people getting salty with me! Ok, now I&#x27;m really done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some benefits:&lt;br /&gt;- Treatment of arthritis (osteo, rheumatoid, psoriatic)&lt;br /&gt;- Treatment of psoriasis&lt;br /&gt;- Treatment of eczema&lt;br /&gt;- Treatment of dandruff&lt;br /&gt;- Reduction of allergic reactions&lt;br /&gt;- Many other skin and muscular diseases&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, on to the salts. They truly do have so many uses, I&#x27;m not even sure where to begin, so I guess I&#x27;ll stick with what I use them for: muscular tremors. A month or so ago (I&#x27;m terrible with dates) I got my first muscular tremors in my legs. There was no visual movement, I couldn&#x27;t see any shaking, but it felt like an earthquake! Though this can be a sign of a more serious illness, I consulted unofficially with some wonderful doctors that I know, and several times two things were mentioned as a good place to start: stress, and a deficiency of magnesium and potassium. I made a point to eat potassium-rich foods, but I was told that magnesium should NOT be a taken as a supplement for a healthy guy in their 20&#x27;s and that I should try a soak. That&#x27;s where Minera comes in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m not going to sit here and say that Minera solved my problems - I still have tremors but I have to say they are less frequent. This is probably a combination of actively trying to reduce stress, increased potassium intake and the magnesium absorbed through these salts, but the latter should not be discounted simply because it was used in conjunction with other treatments! I use these almost exclusively as bath salts - I really don&#x27;t have the patience to use them in wraps or anything like that, although that would probably be the most efficacious way of getting everything directly to my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint about this product is that it is a little pricey. Of course, this is an imported premium product so I&#x27;m not expecting Wal-Mart prices here, but this is an honest review and I am simply stating what is true for me. If you can afford this on a regular basis, I see no reason why you wouldn&#x27;t go with Minera. It&#x27;s guaranteed, imported from Israel and does wonders for the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the price, I would rate this at 4.5 stars, although since Amazon only allows full star amounts I certainly have no problem rating it at 5 rather than 4. Highly recommended!. I made a point to eat potassium-rich foods, but I was told that magnesium should NOT be a taken as a supplement for a healthy guy in their 20&#x27;s and that I should try a soak.

    <li> I use this in a Jacuzzi tub for about an hour to treat my psoriasis.  I&#x27;ve been having my psoriasis treated by a doctor for 25 years and finally felt he was just treating the symptom and not the disease.  I did some internet research and found this product. If it didn&#x27;t work I could at least sit and enjoy a hot Jacuzzi.  It works great!!!!  I try to do a Jacuzzi once every two or three weeks. Another reason I was motivated to find a different solution is because my insurance company stopped paying for the medication the doc was prescribing. It was $60 for a 2 oz bottle.  Dead Sea Salt is a quarter of the cost and you get 10 baths out of a 5 lb. bag and the results are better.  Try it.  It sound stupid but it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, my skin seemed different but the results not significant.  My skin looked a little better and better, every time.  After about 10 treatments I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m 90% cured.  I feel comfortable wearing short sleeves and pants, even in the winter when psoriasis is the worse.  I still use Dermazinc periodically.</li>
    <li> What a great way to relax in a hot tub with 1 cup dead sea salts and 1 cup epson salts. soak in the hottest water you can bare for 20 mins. use no soap, nothing...It detoxifies and makes your skin baby soft. What a treat. would definitely buy from this company again. received in a timely fashion. A+++++++++++++++++++++++++</li>
    <li> I am a new business owner. I can honestly say that I never intended on starting a business, but to use this product as a gift for party favors for my daughter&#x27;s baby shower. Even though I did use it for my initial purpose, I found that my creation with the salts were super loved by my friends and family. To make it even better, Minera offers free shipping and it does not take long to receive the product. And what&#x27;s even better is the certificate of authenticity. I will continue to buy from Minera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/17/2013 UPDATE: I must add that this product is super perfect for my salt scrubs. I use them and so does my customers. They all love the texture and the exfoliation is gentle, but effective. I will continue to use this product for my customers. Three thumbs up SFSC!</li>
    <li> I put about 3-4 cups in a very deep bath and soak for 15 minutes before bed, and the swelling in my feet and knees and anywhere else that&#x27;s been bothering me is definitely reduced the next morning. I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product twice, but could not wait to write a review. I will sure to update with any additional feedback as I use it longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product to treat Sebhorriec Dermatitis on my scalp. Having had this condition for over 10 years, I have quite literally tried everything to treat to it. A random tip from an Internet forum suggested mixing Dead Sea Salt with my shampoo (side not: I use a Deva product that is non lathering and contains no harsh chemicals), I was on board. I will literally.try. anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have done it twice. Both times, I used a little bit os salt mixed into my shamppo and scrubbed all over my scalp, and then took some salt and applied it directly to my scalp. Rinse. Dry. Wait. REJOICE. Wonder in amazement, pray this is real... Repeat 3 days later ... Skeptically check scalp in every available mirror and several kinds of light. CONTINUE REJOICING. Write glowing review on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me be clear, my scalp is not clear... I do have some flakes and evidence of the characteristic caps that are forms by Sebhorreic Dermatitis. BUT, the itching? Gone! The constant need to check my scalp to ensure that no crusty flakes have gotten loose in my hair and are presenting themselves to everyone? GONE. Most importantly, my SD tends to creep out from my hairline and onto my face (around the top of my forehead) and it has completely VANISHED. I could not be more thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;ve also used this product as intended, to soak in a tub, and it&#x27;s wonderful. I ordered the fine grain and was impressed with the quality. After on bath I found that my sore muscles were relaxed and an igrown hair that was forming on my biking area had drained and was ready to be plcuked out (perhaps a little TMI, but noteworthy - if you&#x27;re suffered from these, you know!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly reccomend this product and will definitely be a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> my mom has toe nail pain for more than half year. she could barely walk. went to different doctors but it was just getting worse.&lt;br /&gt;i looked up online and found soaking in sea salt water might help. so i ordered this for my mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;she soaked her feet twice a day,  20 minutes each time. it worked like miracle! better than any medicine/cream that docs prescribed.&lt;br /&gt;now she feels much better. not fully recovered but at least we see hope..</li>
    <li> just what I ordered, no complaints</li>
    <li> After radiation treatment for cancer, my body became extremely sensitive to bubble baths and perfumes. I have a bath almost every day, so what to do? These bath salts are wonderful. I add a couple of drops of an essential oil, and the salts soften the water and my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing this in future to replace the bubble baths I&#x27;ve always used.</li>
    <li> Soooooooooooo relaxing !!!!!!! Made my skin feel sooooo soft after first bath.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very few tiny misc particles, but that&#x27;s not a concern at all. The fine grain is grainy enough for face scrubs without being too abrasive.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!!  I actually had some of my friends ask me what I was doing differently with my skin.  My akin is so soft and it glows now.  Huge difference!!</li>
    <li> Great product. I have been struggling with some sort of rash and this works better than the prescription cream and oral antibiotics that the doctor prescribed. Super fast shipping and great customer service too.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I used it after bath with a face cleanse and I could tell my face felt clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> Does what it promises. Soaks helped psoriasis tremendously. After buying sea salt locally at five bucks a pound I now know what I was buying from wholefoods could be anything. I didnt get results but with minera I see a change in my skin. Never going back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling for months with a flare up of my seborrheic dermatitis. This condition is extremely embarrassing. I was constantly scratching my scalp and big chunks of it were coming off and taking my hair with it. Flakes were constantly everywhere. I tried everything to treat it, from prescription to charcoal shampoos. I read something online about sea salt being the best treatment. Dead sea minerals have the highest content of natural enzymes in any sea salt so I ordered this product after reading many helpful reviews. I&#x27;ve only soaked my head once so far and I can already tell a huge difference. I&#x27;m not itching and the flakes are disappearing. My scalp isn&#x27;t all red and inflamed like it was with everything else I tried.&lt;br /&gt;I felt a little bit of a sting but it simply felt like it was working, especially on the inflamed areas. It doesn&#x27;t burn like all the prescription shampoos I tried.&lt;br /&gt;I also have bad eczema so when I get another flare-up with that, I&#x27;ll be using this sea salt! But seriously, for anyone suffering from seb derm, you must try this product. I&#x27;m so happy I found a natural cure!</li>
    <li> We use on our hands and face and it for sure makes a difference!</li>
    <li> Works great for dry flaky skin</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!  Last year I had a vicious rash - never identified although I suspect it was a result of nickel sensitivity from a cheap but cute watch I bought, and then ultrasensitivity to topical and oral steroids I was given to control the rash but always seemed to make it worse.  A friend told me to try to find some Dead Sea mud or salts and by then I was just about out of my mind and found some at a local Whole Foods market.  I had tried soda baths, oatmeal baths, vinegar baths, Silver soap, all allergy  and itch lotions, but this was the most soothing and, once I quit taking all the meds the docs were Rx-ing, I got over the rash.  I&#x27;m hooked and this price is so much better than the tubs at Whole Foods. I shall order again.</li>
    <li> Ok so I was quite pleasantly surprised at how big rhis bag is so great price. Haven&#x27;t used it yet but will update review when I do.</li>
    <li> This item,Mineral,Dead Sea Salt ,was advised for eczema,i purchased it for my granddaughter,sorry to sad it only made her skin dryer ..</li>
    <li> I would give 5 stars if not for the expensive price.  I loved every bit of this salt.  I was high quality and very relaxing to use.  However, the price has been keeping me from repurchasing.</li>
    <li> You get a lot for your money!</li>
    <li> Used this to make salt scrub.  Fine grain is still sizeable.  Great for hand or body scrubs, too large for facial scrub. Just my opinion..</li>
    <li> Always get good service and for me the dead sea salt heals my skin and relieves pain. It is soothing and helps with itching.Thanks for all the info and little gifts that come with my order. Thanks from a customer in AZ</li>
    <li> Works great for seborrheic dermatitis.  Soaking my bad spots for 2 weeks and then a few times a week for that to keep it at bay.  I read an article about using dead sea salt and it has worked better than any medication the doctor has given me.</li>
    <li> These are a great salt for adding to bathwater or for making a homemade salt scrub. I feel the price is reasonable and they delivered to your door.</li>
    <li> I received the product in a few days.  It comes with a certificate of authenticity and a free gift of French Grey Salt.  Nice little touch! The certificate of authenticity also had the chemical analysis break down on the card. Very nice!  The over-all presentation of this product is excellent.</li>
    <li> Used to make body/face seaweed scrubs. This is nice and good quantity!</li>
    <li> ive used Dead Sea salts in the past, but there seemed to be a lot of irritants in this brand. I won&#x27;t use this brand again.</li>
    <li> While sea salt has a lot more to offer than epsom salt baths, I am forced to use a lot more of sea salt to get a similar bathing experience. I have lived in the coastal area for most of my life and I remember spending a good amount of playing in the sea water. I couldn&#x27;t get my bath water to feel like water from the sea even after emptying 2 pounds of this salt.</li>
    <li> Hello, Everyone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a type of guy who reads almost every single review negative and positive and come up with a conclusion for myself. I  also very heavily rely on the star rating. Anything 3 stars and below I&#x27;m very careful to order; anything 4/5 stars I still do my work but rely more on peoples reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was quick Item works wonders, haven&#x27;t tried it on myself but my girlfriend tried it and it worked wonders on her skin after only one use. Customer service was quick and very friendly. A+ service I would recommend this product no doubt. I&#x27;m going to purchase the 60 lb one soon. That&#x27;s how satisfied I am with this product</li>
    <li> What a great buy!  I had been buying Dead Sea Salt at a Farmer&#x27;s Market and paying the same amount for just a few ounces..this is well worth the money spent and it a quality product.  I use it daily and still have a bag full.</li>
    <li> Dead Sea Salt was exactly as described!  Shipping was exceptionally fast. Will definitely order this item again. Would recommend their products to other buyers.</li>
    <li> So relaxing in the tub filled with warm water and these salts. Nice way to treat your tired body. Also, has healing powers. I use it to treat my eczema--condition much improved.</li>
    <li> I will always buy this product. Its better than regular sea salt. It just felt healing</li>
    <li> Great price, quality, and service. It dissolves completely in the tub and feels great. It also relieves any itching of the skin (including hemorrhoids). I will order again.</li>
    <li> Bag was a lot bigger than expected. Great product!</li>
    <li> Ive enjoyed this bath salt so much that I went from ordering 5lbs. to 20lbs. As far as I can tell it is a quality product and I will continue to use it for it&#x27;s health benefits.</li>
    <li> This is so great.  It works well, arrived in a timely manner and in the condition expected.  You will need a container to put it in after opening.  They also sent some extra salt to try.  will definitely order from them again.</li>
    <li> I like it however it does have a sea like smell to it that I am not crazy about. If you like this &#x27;earthy&#x27; smell then you will like it. A bit pricey for my needs.</li>
    <li> As a business that makes Dead Sea salt products I will not use any other type of salt in our products. The Minera Dead Sea salt is by far the best and we couldn&#x27;t be happier www.detoxskinintervention.com</li>
    <li> this product is great for those with eczema and psoriasis and it really helps improve my skin even through it takes time to clear up.</li>
    <li> Best sea salt ever! I used for my face mask, body scrub, and foot stub! Work wonderful. No more redness on my cheek</li>
    <li> I like how it came with a certificate to ensure authenticity.</li>
    <li> product was received as labeled and what I expected; happy customer here;</li>
    <li> Wonderful salt. I am very pleased with this purchase. I use it to make &amp;#34;ormus&amp;#34;, and the yield is very high, and the quality is outstanding. I am also very pleased with this company. They are a perfect 5 stars n every category. I am very glad I have found them and will definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I never used this before, however, you can feel its potency, which is amazing. It arrived in good time however, the bag was damaged on either side in the front; two indents eventually turned to holes that I had to tape closed. I think it was from how it was stored in the warehouse or on the mail carrier journey to my house because it looked like the bag had been sitting in that position for a while in order for holes like that to form. Other than that it&#x27;s great for my homemade scrubs and soaks.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Great packaging!  5 stars all the way!! Couldn&#x27;t be any better!  Will order again for sure!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend swears by the stuff and is very specific with the brand.  She uses it in a saltwater bath and also as a general exfoliator in the shower.</li>
    <li> My orders were here in a very timely manner and my 18 year old loved the product</li>
    <li> I am an Esthetician in Florida and all i can say is wow!!!! Great company, great product!!! Arrived three days earlier then expected!!! I will be buying more from this company :)</li>
    <li> This was used for bath salts. It has it&#x27;s own smell and feel, and I love it minerals in the bath water.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Love it. It helped me clear my skin infection due to allergy to petrolium jelly around my mouth. Spent more than 600$ on bad chemical prescriptions. This one worked like a charm just for 15$</li>
