<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love Bare Minerals Bare Naked foundation and at first did not but this brush. I found that I wasted a lot of the makeup using other brushes. I am so happy I bought this. It has made a huge difference in application of the makeup and prevents waste.</li>
    <li> This brush isn&#x27;t very good. It streaks and doesn&#x27;t apply the product hardly at all. I hate it and I regret ever purchasing this and the bare essentials foundation.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush i dont use bare minerals but wanted to try this brush its absolutely amazing in application. Put a little or a lot into the middle pot and apply. Great full coverage as well, i notice another reviewer mentioned streaking but if you use in a circular motion that isnt an issue. Well worth the price</li>
    <li> Great brush to apply the makeup smoothly.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and just what I was looking for.  Yes, I can see a few brush lines but easy to smooth out with finger tips.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> Such a luxurious and one of the highest quality cosmetics brushes on the market.</li>
    <li> Could be a good brush but does not well with OTC cosmetics, only bare minerals.</li>
    <li> Love the brush.  It works very well in applying my Bare Escentials foundation.  I would recommend purchasing this brush.</li>
    <li> I used this brush with the bare minerals bare skin pure serum foundation. For the price, this brush wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected. It doesn&#x27;t get the corners of my nose or under my eyes very well. I do have dry skin that flakes and this brush still made me flake a bit. This may be a good brush but it doesn&#x27;t work well with my skin type.</li>
    <li> Uses less makeup and brushes so evenly.  Will never go back to sponges!</li>
    <li> This coupled with the bare minerals &amp;#34;BareSkin&amp;#34; make is the best makeup I have ever used.  Absolutely perfect.  this brush is $29. at &amp;#34;Ulta&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Very nice product and works perfectly with the Bare Minerals BareSkin Pure Serum Foundation Broad Spectrum SPF 20 Bare Natural 07 1.0 oz</li>
    <li> This is the second time I ordered it (not from same retailer). The first one never showed up, but this one had very fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;I really like the way it feels on my skin. Very soft and smooth application. I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often, but this is definitely the brush I go to first.&lt;br /&gt;Only issue I had was the first time I used it with the bare minerals liquid was I forgot to shake the bottle before putting it on the brush. DON&#x27;T FORGET TO DO THAT or your face will be so oily and uneven!!!</li>
    <li> Great for smooth, even application.</li>
    <li> This foundation is a perfect color, so lightweight that I hardly feel that I am wearing foundation. Because it is not pore clogging, it wears off after a while and needs to be reapplied, but it&#x27;s worth the time and effort for the overall appearance.  I would recommend it to anyone who wears foundation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not so sure I like the liquid foundation from Bare Minerals but I absolutely love this brush! It&#x27;s wonderful for applying foundation. I&#x27;m going to try a new brand but this brush is coming with me. Makes it so easy to apply makeup flawlessly. Great product. Highly recommended. :)</li>
    <li> Never had such a soft nice brush. Worth the money</li>
    <li> No complaints, just don&#x27;t need to fill brush.  Oops, learned the hard way.  I use finger tips to stipple over face.</li>
    <li> Got this really quickly and it is erfect. Hate paying full price fro anything but want the quality of the bare mineral brushes.This is a great quality and a must have</li>
    <li> I love this brunch, it goes perfectly with my bare minerals foundation. The only downside is that it takes a couple of washes to get all of the make up out of the brush when I clean it, but that could also be due to how I clean it.</li>
    <li> I love this brush so much. It&#x27;s high quality, the hairs of the brush don&#x27;t fall out, and it is extremely soft. It doesn&#x27;t leave lines on my face like some other reviews said so I think that may be a more watery foundation that they&#x27;re using. But does go away once you put powder on top. I DEFINITELY recommend.</li>
    <li> easy to use ,and very soft brush great..</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing!  Also love the new make-up.</li>
    <li> Best foundation brush ever</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this brush that has a special indentation at the top to hold my liquid foundation make-up. It makes applying my make-up so much easier and cleaner than using my fingertips.  Thank You Very Much!!</li>
    <li> So easy to use.My makeup looks so natural.</li>
    <li> Like that it applies and blends in one step. End result is a bit sheer but you can always increase coverage. After few washing have not had a problem with shedding and it has become my most used foundation brush.</li>
    <li> so worth the money, it is really soft!</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking I was probably overdoing it because why would I not just use my finger but honestly, this brush is awesome! It really does blend the makeup well on your face. I have also tried with my finger, which works ok, but your skin on your hand soaks the vitamin enriched makeup right up so it works best to use the brush. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> The bristles starting falling out within in a few days. I am a Bare Minerals lover and thought this product was highly inferior to their standards.</li>
    <li> Perfect for applying 1-2 drops of BareSkin serum foundation to whole face. Put drops in well, stipple lightly on areas you want most coverage (discoloration or red areas, nose) and then blend starting at outer edges of face. You hardly need any makeup with this brush. Also works fabulously with IT cc+ if you need the 50spf physical coverage in summer</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for my Bareskin! I love it!</li>
    <li> OK... so I really thought buying a specific brush to apply my Bare Minerals was a bit ridiculous. I had plenty of brushes I thought would work fine. I WAS WRONG! This brush is seriously worth the money. It saves on the amount of Bare Minerals you need to apply. Buy the brush. It is worth every penny. It saves on makeup and the finish look is beautiful.</li>
    <li> Such a great brush! Makes foundation look flawless</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  It works well!</li>
    <li> This brush is great once you get the hang of it. Just like from the box stores but a way better price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  It&#x27;s a brush.  However, I found that the [[ASIN:B004TSFE6Y real Techniques Stippling Brush]] works just as well if not better and is CONSIDERABLY cheaper.  I purchased both right here on Amazon and guess which arrived the fastest?  Yep!  The Real Techniques.</li>
    <li> I just got this brush to use with bare minerals new liquid foundation. The bristles are longer on the outside and shorter in the middle so that it forms a &amp;#34;bowl&amp;#34; that &amp;#34;cups&amp;#34; the foundation.  That&#x27;s the best way I can think to describe it.  I&#x27;ve used it with the new bare minerals foundation as well as my other liquid foundation by Clinique.  It works equally well with both, so don&#x27;t think that you can&#x27;t use this brush unless you buy bare minerals foundation.  My chief complaint is that that bristles leave thin streaks on my face as I apply the foundation that I have to smooth out with my fingers.  (Although I don&#x27;t notice the streaking as much with my Clinique foundation).  Applying a powdered blush on top has also helped to smooth out the streaks and set the foundation.  Overall, just OK I guess.  I do love that I can now apply liquid foundation with a brush, rather than my hands or a cheap pad of foam. But I don&#x27;t like the streaks.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush for putting on liquid foundation, The one on the Bare Minerals site was $38.This one is much less expensive and of comparable quality.</li>
    <li> This brush is a must if you&#x27;re using bare skin makeup! When I first bought the foundation I used a different brush and was about to give up on the foundation until I realized that the brush I was using was the problem. It&#x27;s little expensive but it&#x27;s definitley worth it!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. Kind of pricey but it never makes makeup look streaked.</li>
    <li> I love the results of using this uniquely designed brush! I just need the correct shade of foundation to use it with!</li>
    <li> Love this brush for any foundation!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Want to buy another to have as an extra! Best brush ever! I have no negatives about it</li>
    <li> This is worth every penny. I was like pffff to the bare minerals rep when they told me that this specific face brush was a must to buy with the foundation. And they are correct it&#x27;s such a huge difference.</li>
    <li> Love this brush but wish I bought the Bareskin foundation on Amazon bc it is 10.00 cheaper than in the store.</li>
    <li> Great brush for any foundation. I use the lightest color and its been hard to find so I have tried my BB creams and other cream foundations and the brush itself is perfection! Love love love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for applying liquid foundation period.  It doesn&#x27;t matter what brand you use, this brush helps you apply your foundation evenly and you don&#x27;t have to use as much of your product. The price is a little steep, however, all things considered it is worth it if it holds up for at least one year. Too soon to tell.</li>
    <li> I hesitated spending $25 on a makeup bush and was concerned it wouldn&#x27;t work with the Olay 7 effects foundation I already own and want to use up before I buy the bareminerals foundation. However, I love it! the brush work fabulously with the foundation I already own and I am sure it will only do better with its co-foundation. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I like the way it applies the make up.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. Great product and service.</li>
    <li> A bit pricey but I am a fan of bare minerals products and wanted the full experience of using it with the Bareskin</li>
    <li> I did not have such brush in my life. It&#x27;s the best brush for your face.</li>
    <li> I guess I am looking at something different but there isn&#x27;t an indentation in the brush but it seems to work ok.</li>
    <li> bought it for my gf, she loves it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful  makeup applicator. I use with all my liquids</li>
    <li> Wife says one of the best brushes she has used.</li>
    <li> I saw this brush in a Bare Minerals ad and thought I&#x27;d try it.  I love it!  I use it with another liquid foundation and it just helps to make the application easier.  I certainly didn&#x27;t need to add another brush to the arsenal but I&#x27;m sure glad I did.</li>
    <li> This is great for applying the Bareskin Pure Brightening Serum Foundation. It couldn&#x27;t be done well without it.</li>
    <li> The brush is  amazing how smooth it applies makeup</li>
    <li> Just love it!!! Best brush ever!!!!</li>
    <li> Incredible brush! Totally recommend.</li>
    <li> Perfect tool for the bare minerals BareSkin Pure Brightening Serum.  Definite MUST HAVE.</li>
    <li> Love this brush for liquid makeup application.</li>
    <li> Perfect brush for Bare Minerals BareSkin Pure Serum Foundation.  This is a great value and perfectly applies the product.</li>
    <li> Great foundation brush.</li>
    <li> A make-up sponge will do just fine. The brush dozen&#x27;&#x27;t give a nice smooth finish, so I have to use my make-up sponge to fix it. It&#x27;s a waste of money for nothing.</li>
    <li> This brush is a must have to use the bare minerals foundation!</li>
    <li> Everything was as expected</li>
    <li> its ok - I dont think there is an advantage to this brush vs other (less expensive) brushes.  I am not a make up expert - but an everyday person!  :)</li>
    <li> the liquid foundation would not go on nearly as smooth without this they should come as a set.</li>
    <li> Fantastic brush, great contouring.</li>
    <li> This is the most expensive brush I have ever purchased in my life but so worth it. I used my NARS tinted moisturizer and the color I purchased was too dark for my skin but after blending with this brush I was able to brush in the color and it matched more to my skin complexion. And I cldnt hold out from buying the bare minerals skin brightening foundation because Im so impressed with this brush. Its a great investment because its great quality and ppl like me who are new to the foundation world really should try it. Its the best.</li>
    <li> Great company to work with!  Love, love, LOVE the brush!!!</li>
    <li> One of the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t always believe that you get what you pay for, and I&#x27;ve tried various high end make up brands and been disappointed with results. I find many cheaper alternatives from Boots are just as good.&lt;br /&gt;However, Bare Minerals has impressed me time and time again.&lt;br /&gt;This brush, although odd looking, gives me the most flawless finish I&#x27;ve ever achieved. The longer bristles cup around the contours of your face, and the shorter ones diffuse any streaks of fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit perplexed when I saw the shape, but it works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;The coverage is light and even. Once set you can build it up for something fuller. It looks airbrushed and perfect, whilst feeling lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;ve given it 4/5 is that it&#x27;s difficult to clean! I used it for about 12-14 days..Took me a constant 10 minutes to work all the foundation out. Using both a brush cleaner, then baby shampoo. And even then I think there was probably a tad left.&lt;br /&gt;However, it was worth it as it&#x27;s cut down my makeup application time every morning. I love it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected.</li>
    <li> Good brush,  keeps makeup inside the hole until it gets to your face.</li>
    <li> Must-have for the liquid foundation! TRUST ME.</li>
    <li> Still getting used to using it.  But so far so good</li>
    <li> Brush spreads foundation as it is supposed to. Definitely causes me to use less with the brush than using my hands so what Bare minerals claims is true. You use less product with the brush.</li>
    <li> Great brush!  BareMinerals/Bare Escentuals you suprise me all the time!  Keep up the great work!</li>
    <li> Just what I wAs looking for in the brush and cheaper than the store</li>
    <li> The items came in two days and was just as I expected</li>
    <li> Love the brush blends well</li>
    <li> Great quality. Works perfectly for spreading the makeup.</li>
    <li> makes a huge difference when using the bare minerals liquid makeup!</li>
    <li> Okay so I&#x27;ve had this brush for a few months and use it regularly. It&#x27;s wonderful with this foundation. However, it can be frustrating as it&#x27;s nearly impossible to use all the foundation because it seeps down into the middle of the bristles! And cleaning it is an odyssey since there&#x27;s a lot of extra &#x27;goop&#x27; in the bristles.</li>
    <li> Very much need to use the foundation</li>
    <li> Helps apply foundation to make gave flawless. Buy it.  Is great</li>
    <li> This brush does the flawless finish, I love it!</li>
    <li> I love the brush! It does its job...👍</li>
    <li> Highly recommended for application of the Bare Minerals liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this brush and it does a very nice job of applying my foundation.  The only problem I have is that the little bristles come out of the brush.  I feel like it is falling apart with every use, which makes me sad as I love this brush.</li>
    <li> perfect for what its used for</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> It did just what they said it would.</li>
    <li> Love the brush. Use it with a different brand foundation and works awesome.</li>
    <li> great brush for a great new foundation!</li>
    <li> Is a great makeup brush to use.  It gives a nice even application.</li>
    <li> This is not smart purchase . I am not happy at all. The quality is ZERO . The hair is falling very badly.</li>
    <li> I love this brush and the new foundation. I usually like a medium to full coverage and I get it with this. A good trick that the wonderful bare minerals employees told me is to inly use 1-2 drops at a time. That will help with any streaking. A little goes a long way. Also the perfecting veil pressed powder sets it beautify.  I love the trio</li>
    <li> As described,Quick ship,Will buy again,Thank you!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Love it.</li>
    <li> works really well with foundation</li>
    <li> Smooth Transaction - Just as described!!</li>
    <li> I use this with L&#x27;Oreal Magic Nude Liquid Powder which is a thinner foundation. This brush provides even coverage while using very little foundation. It does a great job of blending. Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> A must have to apply the foundation.</li>
    <li> Best blending tool ever.  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for the Bare Mineral product I am using and at a great price.</li>
    <li> Love this Brush, great for applying the Bare Minerals Bareskin.</li>
    <li> This is a great makeup brush no matter what kind of foundation you use it with.  It&#x27;s a little challenging to clean well because of the density of the indented center; however, whether you buy the Bareskin makeup or not, this brush is a nice addition to anyone&#x27;s makeup brush collection.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this makeup brush! I like to squirt my primer and liquid foundation into the &amp;#34;dip&amp;#34; together then just buff it on my face! it makes a tremendous difference and I haven&#x27;t been able to find this brush any cheaper on other sites or in stores so its a very good deal and worth every penny! I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;ve saved money by not buying wedges or more cheap brushes and its really cut down on the time it takes to apply my makeup! It blends very well, so that also keeps me from touching my face and breaking out! It is very easy to clean and dries perfectly, holding the shape! I would recommend this brush for every woman who uses liquid foundation and/ or primer!</li>
    <li> Good brush! Did not like it to put on foundation serum. Good for powders. Good Quality.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> This brush is super soft and does an excellent job applying makeup. Its much much nicer than BareMinerals other brushes</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  I do not use it with BareMinerals.  I could probably bought a cheaper brush without the &amp;#34;cup&amp;#34; to hold the liquid foundation, but the coverage is awesome.  It&#x27;s my new everyday tool.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  amazing!  I love it.</li>
    <li> High quality, cutting edge make-up brush</li>
    <li> You really should treat yourself to this brush if you buy the new liquid mineral makeup. You can put the new makeup on with your fingers, but this brush is so soft and really makes makeup application easy and streakless.  Remember to swirl on makeup in a circular motion.  Use a couple of drops of make up to start, you can always add more for more coverage.</li>
    <li> Love the brush! amazing distribution of the serum foundation and so easy to use. Have used many brushes but simply adore this one and have tried using it on another liquid foundation and works just great too so you are never limited. Love it!</li>
    <li> Nice brush but a little on the expensive side! Does a good job with coverage! Would recommend to others for sure-</li>
    <li> This is a great foundation brush.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know exactly how this worked, but it does!  I really like Bare Minerals and this plus the liquid foundation are wonderful.  The loose powder is messy, but works perfectly.  This is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t  leave any residue on the bathroom counter.  Great brush.</li>
    <li> Perfect brush for Bare Minerals BareSkin Serum Foundation.</li>
    <li> Works as they said it would with the foundation. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> best makeup brush I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> No complaints. Works great with the serum foundation and smooths on nicely! It is extremely soft on your skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to go with the BareMinerals makeup.  I didn&#x27;t care for the makeup, but the brush works really well with my usual makeup.  It really helped to provide even coverage.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This is not the exact brush. It is a dupe and I wish that was disclosed. I brought the real brush from Sephora. This brush is not as soft as the real brush and this is harder to clean than the original brush.</li>
    <li> I love the brush before I lost my original one. This is a replacement brush.</li>
    <li> Bristles are too short and compact for applying mineral makeup; perhaps I bought the wrong one?</li>
    <li> Excellent make up applying brush - much better than others I have tried</li>
    <li> Great quality brush,  very soft and blends well.</li>
    <li> Not a fan. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t like the foundation or the brush or both together.  The brush on it&#x27;s own is well made, soft and dense. I will try it with some other of my more liquidity foundations and update my review.</li>
    <li> its the best foundation brush i have ever bought. very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly. Works great! GOOD quality brush.</li>
    <li> The only brush that really works well with Bare Minerals fluid foundation</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t necessary but it works well</li>
    <li> amazing method to apply and blends perfectly</li>
    <li> Great brush. Use it with bareminerals new liquid foundation. Love the flawless application. Easy to clean and Dries overnight.</li>
    <li> Great foundation brush.</li>
    <li> Will be using it soon.</li>
