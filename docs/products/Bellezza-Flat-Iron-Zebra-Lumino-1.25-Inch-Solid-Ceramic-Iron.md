    <li> Love it!!!!-works better then most expensive iron!! :-)</li>
    <li> My friend bought this flat iron at the mall for 125 dollars. She curled my hair with it with no product just for fun (my hair falls flat no matter how much product is in there) and I went to sleep and woke up and my hair looked like she just did it. I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I had to buy one. I don&#x27;t know what it is but this thing surly surpasses my chi. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel fried, cooked, dead (which it is!) or anything but lively and shiny and beautiful!</li>
    <li> The price is right for a product like this.....love it and works amazing!! HOT and leaves your hair very smooth.</li>
    <li> My wife went to the mall and a saleswoman tried to sell her this for $110 on sale. I told her she would be crazy to pay that much and that we should wait and check prices online. We were both pleased to see it on Amazon for the price we paid. Now my wife is as happy as a clam.</li>

    <li> Love this flat iron. I got it in one day. I had bought one at a mall kiosk for my granddaughter @$149.00 (ouch) and went online to order one for myself and found them at this price and it is exactly the same product! Beware of mall kiosks!!!!</li>
