### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best scent for men.  </li>
      <li>The lalique encre noir I ordered though is the best for me</li>
      <li>Excellent service!</li>
      <li>:-D</li>
      <li>all wonderful.  </li>
      <li>On time delivery and a very good price.</li>
      <li>It is really a great fragrance though</li>
      <li>What a great scent.</li>
      <li>Great product, price and delivery.</li>
      <li>Amazon, good job again.</li>
      <li>That being said, it&#x27;s a good cologne for the price.  </li>
      <li>The product I received appears to be genuine and in excellent condition.  </li>
      <li>or I would not have ordered it, but you should try it yourself and form your own opinion as to whether it’s a good match for you.</li>
      <li>I timely got the product at a nice price.</li>
      <li>Excellent, a strong and long-lasting woodsy/herbal scent, yet with the certain underlying sophistication Guerlain excels in.</li>
      <li>(I believe this has been reformulated) but I really love this scent a lot.</li>
      <li>Simply put, the best!</li>
      <li>suggest you make sure that the product you are ordering is the one you want because you will not be able to return, even the unopened packages.</li>
      <li>I like this even more because Arnold Schwarzenegger wears it</li>
      <li>I love Guerlain Imperial though and will stick with that scent.</li>
      <li>More than three sprays is probably gonna gas people out of the room.</li>
      <li>I have always liked the clean and citrusy fragrance of Guerlain&#x27;s Vetiver.</li>
      <li>It was delivered when promised, which was much earlier than originally suggested, and in excellent condition.</li>
      <li>While many people like this cologne, it makes you smell like you smoke a cigarette or cigar or were in a smoke filled room.</li>
      <li>The products are excited and I&#x27;m fully satisfied.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t comment on projection bit I have heard you should probably go easy on the trigger with this one.</li>
      <li>This stuff is a classic, and with good reason.  </li>
      <li>The best summer perfume a real man can put on himself early in the morning after a shower, it is so refreshing, uplifting and energising, love it, love it, this is probably the most natural scent I had ever smelled so far.</li>
      <li>it seems that the scent is not fresh---as though it has lost its strength and unique smell---it is not the scent i remember.</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t tell you how this compares to the original formula</li>
      <li>This is a review of the Guerlain Vetiver Eau De Toilette Spray for Men as sold by Amazon (not a third-party vendor) August 2014, and focuses only on whether the product was genuine and in good condition.  </li>
      <li>It is bright and invigorating, with sharp citrus springing up just before a crisp vetiver with a nice amount of bite.  </li>
      <li>Sure, it might not be as &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;accessible&amp;#34; as Aqua di Gio (no hate toward ADG, mind you), but this is a smooth, classy vetiver that pulls off an old-world charm without being stuffy.  </li>
      <li>Obviously I think it’s a good product</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like many of the modern fragrances out there which is why I like it.</li>
      <li>To me it just kind of has a citrusy, earthy, grassy vibe with a bit of that old school barber shop feel.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad</li>
      <li>THANKS!!</li>
      <li>G. vetiver smells great,clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>It is subtile and fresh.</li>
      <li>Vetiver is worth a sniff.</li>
      <li>Package came a day early (before vacation) and I was able to fully enjoy this classic sailing across the sea.</li>
      <li>it is just dark, woodsy and I never thought a burning smell could be so pleasant.</li>
      <li>I wear this purim since my first date.</li>
      <li>If you want to try something a bit different from most of the newer stuff out there</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d buy another bottle of it in the future, unless another scent comes along that I like more.</li>
      <li>Not a traditional cologne for a man; however, makes it all the more desirable.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I hear it is the bomb the cool classy one.</li>
      <li>On my skin it seems to have pretty decent longevity too.</li>
      <li>Thanks again for impressing me.</li>
      <li>Too much money for what seems like an &#x27;after shave&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>I know some people that really don&#x27;t like it</li>
      <li>I really like this smell.</li>
      <li>I am very</li>
      <li>Sharp, crisp, clean scent.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I decided to make a blind purchase on this because of the great reviews I have seen both here on Amazon and by the fragrance community.</li>
      <li>I only wear this when working out or when I just wanna have a spicy fresh smell to me after I get out of the shower and am going to go outdoors.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s much less of the sharp vetiver scent a lot more of a somewhat floral undertone.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is not a review of the quality of the product generally.  </li>
      <li>It is not nearly as pungent as some of its modern counterparts (e.g., Encre Noire), but vetiver definitely is the star of the show, and it makes its presence known.  </li>
      <li>Subtle and yet strong  </li>
      <li>It is a formal kind of scent the guerlain is every day dress casual scent.</li>
      <li>Very blah and the vetiver lays low; the other cheap-smelling ingredients take</li>
      <li>but then I have some people that say it&#x27;s good or doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>

<li> Try it out if you like Terre d&#x27;Hermes or Tom Ford&#x27;s Grey Vetiver.</li>
<li> /&gt;It is more expensive at the duty-free shop at the Paris airport!</li>
<li> It is fresh and does not get &#x27;stale&#x27; like other scents, even the next day.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t find it that different from Tom Ford Vetiver Gray at about half the price.</li>
<li> Imagine your suited up grandfather leaving the barbershop after a wet shave.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a fresh soapy smell which doesn&#x27;t make me personally feel gross or sick.</li>
<li> I thought it would be a little stronger than an after shave.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s been some time since I last used this, so I could be remembering it wrong.  </li>
<li> As other reviewers have said, anyone that used this cologne back in the day may be a little disappointed.  </li>
<li> I would say it lasts at least 8 hours for me.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not AMAZING.</li>
<li> I was nervous that the product may be counterfeit or stale, but that was not the case here; everything was correct.  </li>

    <li> The best summer perfume a real man can put on himself early in the morning after a shower, it is so refreshing, uplifting and energising, love it, love it, this is probably the most natural scent I had ever smelled so far.</li>
    <li> I really like this smell. It&#x27;s not bad but it&#x27;s not AMAZING. I know some people that really don&#x27;t like it but then I have some people that say it&#x27;s good or doesn&#x27;t smell bad. It&#x27;s a fresh soapy smell which doesn&#x27;t make me personally feel gross or sick. I only wear this when working out or when I just wanna have a spicy fresh smell to me after I get out of the shower and am going to go outdoors. I like this even more because Arnold Schwarzenegger wears it :-D Which motivates me when it&#x27;s on. If you can sample it do so. This is definitely different than I had expected. I&#x27;d buy another bottle of it in the future, unless another scent comes along that I like more.</li>
    <li> Great product, price and delivery.</li>
    <li> I wear this purim since my first date. I have compliment on the sent from everybody. It is subtile and fresh. The price is unbelievable:&lt;br /&gt;It is more expensive at the duty-free shop at the Paris airport!</li>
    <li> I decided to make a blind purchase on this because of the great reviews I have seen both here on Amazon and by the fragrance community. I am admittedly no fragrance expert and I can&#x27;t tell you how this compares to the original formula (I believe this has been reformulated) but I really love this scent a lot. It is exactly what I was looking for. To me it just kind of has a citrusy, earthy, grassy vibe with a bit of that old school barber shop feel.

    <li> Amazon, good job again.G. vetiver smells great,clean and fresh.The lalique encre noir I ordered though is the best for me it is just dark, woodsy and I never thought a burning smell could be so pleasant. It is a formal kind of scent the guerlain is every day dress casual scent. I would not wear it to the swimming pool,thats what the bulgari aquas are for. Thanks again for impressing me. I cant wait to get my YSL la nuit frozen from you I hear it is the bomb the cool classy one.</li>
    <li> Too much money for what seems like an &#x27;after shave&#x27;.  I thought it would be a little stronger than an after shave.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have said, anyone that used this cologne back in the day may be a little disappointed.  It&#x27;s not the fragrance a remember.  There&#x27;s much less of the sharp vetiver scent a lot more of a somewhat floral undertone.  It&#x27;s been some time since I last used this, so I could be remembering it wrong.  That being said, it&#x27;s a good cologne for the price.  I don&#x27;t find it that different from Tom Ford Vetiver Gray at about half the price.</li>
    <li> This is not the product i have used over the years and now Amazon says I cannot return even the package I did not open.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you make sure that the product you are ordering is the one you want because you will not be able to return, even the unopened packages.</li>
    <li> Excellent, a strong and long-lasting woodsy/herbal scent, yet with the certain underlying sophistication Guerlain excels in. It was delivered when promised, which was much earlier than originally suggested, and in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> I have been a user of Vetiver for over 50 years..It&#x27;s the only cologne I use.. Simply put, the best!</li>
    <li> What a great scent. Package came a day early (before vacation) and I was able to fully enjoy this classic sailing across the sea.</li>
    <li> Sharp, crisp, clean scent. Imagine your suited up grandfather leaving the barbershop after a wet shave.</li>
    <li> it seems that the scent is not fresh---as though it has lost its strength and unique smell---it is not the scent i remember.</li>
    <li> Pres. Kennedy wore this.  Subtle and yet strong  renders compliments.... Thank you for helping get this!</li>

    <li> Everything worked out as programmed. I timely got the product at a nice price. Excellent service!</li>
    <li> The products are excited and I&#x27;m fully satisfied.</li>
    <li> I am a lady who enjoys the scent of vetiver.  When I read women also like this scent, I decided to try it.  It is not for me; I don&#x27;t find the smell unisex. I don&#x27;t even like it for a man. Very blah and the vetiver lays low; the other cheap-smelling ingredients take over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Guerlain products but they missed the mark on this one.</li>
    <li> This is the best scent for men.  It is fresh and does not get &#x27;stale&#x27; like other scents, even the next day.  On time delivery and a very good price.</li>
    <li> I have always liked the clean and citrusy fragrance of Guerlain&#x27;s Vetiver. It keeps on meeting my expectations.</li>
    <li> Everybody likes this scent!</li>
    <li> fragrance, pricing and delivery!!  all wonderful.  THANKS!!</li>
    <li> Not a traditional cologne for a man; however, makes it all the more desirable. I like! Of course each man and her woman wear a cologne and smell a cologne differently.</li>
    <li> While many people like this cologne, it makes you smell like you smoke a cigarette or cigar or were in a smoke filled room. I love Guerlain Imperial though and will stick with that scent.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a classic, and with good reason.  Sure, it might not be as &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;accessible&amp;#34; as Aqua di Gio (no hate toward ADG, mind you), but this is a smooth, classy vetiver that pulls off an old-world charm without being stuffy.  It is bright and invigorating, with sharp citrus springing up just before a crisp vetiver with a nice amount of bite.  It is not nearly as pungent as some of its modern counterparts (e.g., Encre Noire), but vetiver definitely is the star of the show, and it makes its presence known.  Try it out if you like Terre d&#x27;Hermes or Tom Ford&#x27;s Grey Vetiver.</li>
