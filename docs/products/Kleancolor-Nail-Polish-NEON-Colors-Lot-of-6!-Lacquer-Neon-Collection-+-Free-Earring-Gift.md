      <li>I LOVE bright colors.</li>

      <li>I got my polish on time I love the colors love the coverage!</li>
      <li>I am very happy with the different colors that I have gotten in this package.</li>
      <li>Will be investing more money in this brand of nail polish.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the colors in this set.</li>
      <li>They will look perfect after second coat dries.</li>
      <li>Added more to my collection.</li>
      <li>I love the colors I received.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure she will love them.</li>
      <li>I love opaque</li>
      <li>I also love Blues.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>what okay.</li>
      <li>I love the colors.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with the colors (and the price) online.</li>
      <li>Had to put a top coat on to keep it on my nails longer than 20 mins.</li>
      <li>I really like how bright the colours are but</li>
      <li>I love the bold colors</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite neons!  </li>
      <li>Nail polish either chips off in HUGE chucks or comes off in water.</li>
      <li>Also if they are as pigmented as the minis I have, I know i will enjoy them.</li>
      <li>Love these super brite cool colors.</li>
      <li>The colors look exactly like the picture and the polish goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>they are very pretty.</li>
      <li>Fun to mix and match.</li>
      <li>The red didn&#x27;t come out as bright as it normally is</li>
      <li>Colors may not be exactly like like pictures, but they are exactly as they are described on bottle.</li>
      <li>I make sure that the brush isn&#x27;t dripping and do 3 simple strokes - side/side/center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was very ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>they chip really fast.</li>
      <li>They come off without much fuss.</li>
      <li>Additional coats didn&#x27;t do much for color saturation.</li>
      <li>Colors don&#x27;t last they chip off quick</li>
      <li>Live the vivid colors!!</li>
      <li>I was hoping for a bright Daisy yellow - not a dull Banana or Pale Lemon</li>
      <li>All colors chip very easily - after only a few hours, and I avoid using my nails as tools, wear non-latex gloves for cleaning, and &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; my nails for the first 24 hours.</li>
      <li>Neon means that red is more like red/orange and pink is flaming!&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
      <li>If a color doesn&#x27;t look good with my skin color, if I get bored of it, or I notice it doesn&#x27;t get much play in the rotation, I give it to my nieces.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The colors still look amazing and since they are on top of a base coat and 2 layers of another color they do not stain</li>
      <li>The Blue is very summery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First, this set only gets four stars because it doesn&#x27;t take long for Kleancolor to start chipping.</li>
      <li>Was going to be a Christmas present for my 11yr old daughter</li>
      <li>The Pink is very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;- Red, Purple, Blue, Pink - were opaque (as seen in the photo), but the polish is very goopy and takes forever to dry.</li>

<li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to last a few hours, it might work, but for what I wanted - bright NEON colors that lasted a few days - it was not a good purchase.</li>
<li> The cost is low, especially when you get the set and how long you will have them around.</li>

<li> these are not really NEON...</li>
<li> I also tried several base and top coats to help prevent the chipping, but found</li>
<li> They may be a little streaky for first coat, but that is because it is on the thin side.</li>
<li> Some colors like red are really thick and clumpy even after stirring it a million times to try to get the clumps out.</li>
<li> My only issue is that the nail polish is just a little too thick causing my coats to look chunky.</li>
<li> The first coat makes my nails look diseased.</li>
<li> I always use base coat and top coat, and usually use 2 coats of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> few things about my relationship with Nail</li>
<li> The Green paints on</li>
<li> very, very thin, almost sheer.</li>
<li> The blue and green stained my nails so badly that I kept cutting them down while they were growing.</li>
<li> Bottle came broken and colors and not how they look on the pictures</li>
<li> no solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am overall VERY disappointed.</li>
<li> Total crap!</li>
<li> Very disappointing</li>
<li> However, they do stain even with a base coat.</li>
<li> very disappointed....</li>
<li> worst smelling polish EVER!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> these are not really NEON...the ones i received are not as bright as the pics at all. very disappointed....</li>
    <li> The package arrived on time but they were the &amp;#34;holo&amp;#34;  colors and no earrings. Total crap! Was going to be a Christmas present for my 11yr old daughter but there is no time to return them.... Very disappointing</li>
    <li> Colors are very nice but when I received them, one of the polishes was opened and had spilled inside the packaging and ended up empty.</li>
    <li> Live the vivid colors!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on nail. Wish I didn&#x27;t get it</li>
    <li> These neon polishes are awesome! They came wrapped in newspaper so they where in perfect condition. The colors look exactly like the picture and the polish goes on smooth. 2 coats and it covers perfect and even. Great buy! I would totally recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with everything in it says. Nail polish either chips off in HUGE chucks or comes off in water. Had to put a top coat on to keep it on my nails longer than 20 mins. Some colors like red are really thick and clumpy even after stirring it a million times to try to get the clumps out. All need two to three layer to be a nice color. and not very neon for neon nail polish. take my advice and don&#x27;t buy. I even tried to contact seller and no reply. They don&#x27;t care about you the costumer. They just want your money.</li>
    <li> Bought this for Easter basket. Event on Satuday. Hope she like it.</li>
    <li> I got my polish on time I love the colors love the coverage! I will b buying more!</li>
    <li> First, this set only gets four stars because it doesn&#x27;t take long for Kleancolor to start chipping. Within hours actually. BUT they earn the four; for these reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Bottles are generous. You will have them for countless applications.&lt;br /&gt;2. Colors may not be exactly like like pictures, but they are exactly as they are described on bottle. Neon means that red is more like red/orange and pink is flaming!&lt;br /&gt;3. They may be a little streaky for first coat, but that is because it is on the thin side. They will look perfect after second coat dries. Upside is each layer dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;4. The PRICE! The cost is low, especially when you get the set and how long you will have them around. Because they are thinner, you can always add a third coat if they are chipping and you are in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;5. Fun to mix and match. I always apply them in combinations. I never color all my nails the same color.&lt;br /&gt;6. They come off without much fuss.</li>
    <li> I really like how bright the colours are but they chip really fast.</li>
    <li> These polishes need a lot of coats to get the color. There some what okay. Colors don&#x27;t last they chip off quick</li>
    <li> I fell in love with the colors (and the price) online. However, the colors and the quality of the polish do not perform well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things about my relationship with Nail Polish:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I have 30-50 colors at any given time.&lt;br /&gt;- If a color doesn&#x27;t look good with my skin color, if I get bored of it, or I notice it doesn&#x27;t get much play in the rotation, I give it to my nieces.&lt;br /&gt;- I LOVE bright colors. I also love Blues.&lt;br /&gt;- I love opaque polishes.&lt;br /&gt;- I always use base coat and top coat, and usually use 2 coats of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this purchase:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The Green paints on very, very thin, almost sheer. The first coat makes my nails look diseased. Additional coats didn&#x27;t do much for color saturation. It was very ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The Yellow was sheer as well, and despite rolling the bottle before application, the color seemed to pool in the corners. I had to use 3 coats and it just looked too iridescent. I was hoping for a bright Daisy yellow - not a dull Banana or Pale Lemon and this was a mix of both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Red, Purple, Blue, Pink - were opaque (as seen in the photo), but the polish is very goopy and takes forever to dry. I make sure that the brush isn&#x27;t dripping and do 3 simple strokes - side/side/center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The Red looks &amp;#34;cherry red&amp;#34; online but the actual color was a pinkish orange. I&#x27;d rather it have been a bright NEON orange as the photo suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The Pink is very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The Blue is very summery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- All colors chip very easily - after only a few hours, and I avoid using my nails as tools, wear non-latex gloves for cleaning, and &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; my nails for the first 24 hours. I also tried several base and top coats to help prevent the chipping, but found no solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am overall VERY disappointed. If you&#x27;re looking for something to last a few hours, it might work, but for what I wanted - bright NEON colors that lasted a few days - it was not a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I have these too. This is a Christmas gift for my niece. I&#x27;m sure she will love them.</li>
    <li> Love these super brite cool colors. Go on stay on. Added more to my collection.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the colors in this set. They are bright and amazing. However, they do stain even with a base coat. The blue and green stained my nails so badly that I kept cutting them down while they were growing. Now I only use the blue and green for nail art. The colors still look amazing and since they are on top of a base coat and 2 layers of another color they do not stain and I still get to use the beautiful colors. The picture I am attaching is just the pink, red and purple in my stamping design. The red didn&#x27;t come out as bright as it normally is but I think the effect was still great. I still like kleancolor very much, especially for stamping and nail art.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite neons!  So bright and they last forever with no chipping!  Work like a charm for water marble!</li>
    <li> I love the colors I received. they are very pretty. Also if they are as pigmented as the minis I have, I know i will enjoy them. Will be investing more money in this brand of nail polish. For the price, you cannot beat the quality of Kleancolor nail polishes.</li>
    <li> The colors are really bright and look good! But does get somewhat chunky if you don&#x27;t leave enought time to dry between applications.</li>
    <li> The colors weren&#x27;t as &amp;#34;neon&amp;#34; as I hoped. I guess I just wanted them all to be brighter. Good quality paint though</li>
    <li> love the polish and so does my daughter ,I  am a happy customer&lt;br /&gt;cant wait to do my Christmas shopping</li>
    <li> I love the bold colors</li>
    <li> worst smelling polish EVER!</li>
    <li> the colors are bright and I love them! I am very happy with the different colors that I have gotten in this package.</li>
    <li> Bottle came broken and colors and not how they look on the pictures</li>
    <li> I love the colors. My only issue is that the nail polish is just a little too thick causing my coats to look chunky.</li>
