<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great soap, good lather, with very subtle lavender.</li>
    <li> This is great soap and a great buy.Goat soap is so good for my skin and the Lavender tops it off.</li>
    <li> Lavender scent is heavenly and relaxing.  Nice sudsy soap that is a luxury item at an economy price.  Nourishes our skin.  Great product for winter dry skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product...especially if you have sensitive skin.  The lavender oil that they use is of the highest quality.  It makes my bathroom smell like a very expensive spa!  In addition, the bars last a long time making them an excellent value.  I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  Gentle, and doesn&#x27;t melt on the soap holder.  Has more substance than most.</li>
    <li> great product with delightful scent and non drying to your skin</li>
    <li> The only soap I use. Rinses clean!</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Non drying. No matter how many times I wash my hands, they never get dry with this. Use in bath too. I use a cleansing make up pad on my face even though I don&#x27;t use makeup, but would consider this on my face too.  In the winter my skin used to get so dry on my legs and back that it would get scaly. But now that I use this GOATS MILK SOAP that is no longer an issue even if I don&#x27;t moisturize for a few days. Remarkable. Note:  It is big and heavy so since I don&#x27;t want to drop it on my foot in the shower, I use it on the sink to wash my hands for a while to whittle it down.</li>
    <li> I have used Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk soap for many years.  This fragrance is my least favorite. Still a quality soap.</li>
    <li> Do your research. Canus products contain formaldehyde aka DMDM Hydantoin as printed on their ingredient list. Stick with the small Mom and Pop soap makers. Canus has sold out!</li>
    <li> Really great soap.  Can hardly wait to reorder.</li>
    <li> Wonderful feel on the skin and a soft, delicate scent.</li>
    <li> Quality, quality, quality.  This is the best bar soap I have ever used.  It is a hard soap that will last, yet it lathers extremely well.  I the sent it really nice :-).  I also do not get a sense of dry skin after using.</li>
    <li> This soap is a delight to have. It has a subtle smell, goes on the skin nicely and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin. Using it on my (eczema sufferers) children along with the lotion.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> the product is good almost as good as the lotion.  I have bought this products for year and years. I recommend it on baby.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this soap, but the reason I rated it four stars instead of five is because I prefer the unscented, which I rate five stars.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and is non-drying.  The lavender isn&#x27;t my favorite scent, although it may have other benefits in the aromatherapy department, I just don&#x27;t love that smell.</li>
    <li> When buying goat&#x27;s milk soap,it is always better to get one made from milk rather than the milk powder form. Another thing to be aware of is with soap made from natural ingredients, you need to put it on a window sill to air dry or sun dry it after using. It is not as long-lasting as commercial soaps bought from the supermarket.</li>
    <li> This soap is doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin. But it cleans my oily skin and doesn&#x27;t leave that residue feeling. It isn&#x27;t overly scented either.</li>
    <li> Wonderful natural product. My husband and I try to use natural and organic products when ever possible. This soap is great. No nasty additives, it lathers up nicely and cleans well. The scent is very pleasant and the bar last a long time. I highly recommend this. I get it with subscribe and save so we never run out.</li>
    <li> For me it was ok (not the best, but not the worst), but my husband developed severe body odor from using it. I liked the scent of the bar but it didn&#x27;t clean well enough. I&#x27;d pass on this one! As soon as we changed soaps, he was back to smelling fresh as a daisy once again.  We both love Zum Bar goat&#x27;s milk soap, which is available at Whole Foods, among other retailers.</li>
    <li> I love this - keeps my skin moisturized as winter approaches, and rinses cleanly. Smells good, feels good - I recommend it! And the bars are big hefty bars of soap!</li>
    <li> I first bought this soap at our local organics store, but it was about $8 a bar. This is a great deal for three!</li>
    <li> Found this soap while on vacation but not able to get it locally.  Cleans well without drying skin or leaving residue.  Love the lavender scent.</li>
    <li> If you like Lavender then this soap is the answer to having beautiful skin.  It leaves your skin smooth, moisturized and smelling clean!  I love it.  I have given it as gifts and each recipient LOVES it!  It&#x27;s the best of the best!</li>
    <li> the original flavor that I usually order.  I like the lavender, and will give it as gifts, but will probably not stop using the original.  It just smells too good !</li>
    <li> good soap. very creamy and leaves a good feeling to the skin, however the scent is a little too faint for my taste. I would love it if you could smell more lavender.</li>
    <li> CONS-I prefer to leave comments after totally using products but here goes.Sorta minty strong so have to be careful when washing face if gets too close to eyes can burn.Soap bar is SLIGHTLY slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS-Soap doesnt leave scum on ur skin.Aftee using one feels clean like they just used a loofah(a good one).It really makes ur skin feel smooth after.For some lotion is not need but i have really DRY skin so i had to lotion up.After using it feels like ur pores hav opened up and been cleansed.I cant explain it u just HAVE TO TRY IT.I am a VERY fussy picky peraon when ot comes to using skin stuff....oh i also noticed aince using this i sweated less....i wrk in a food place so its really damn hot....i smelled less of the oils in work and more like me....also sweated less.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more of this soon its in my cart already along with the cream/lotion to it.</li>
    <li> I break out easily and this soap is so gentle on my skin and it is so soft now. I love the lavender smell. I love this soap so I just had to subscribe!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It works really great for dry skin and it smells really good too. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for dry skin relief.</li>
    <li> My five years girl loves this product. She has eczema and this soap (combined with facial cream) makes she felt much better!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about four years it really cleans &amp; softens my skin with no soap film residue</li>
    <li> My only soap now! It doesn&#x27;t irritate and lathers to a gentle froth not like the perfumed body washes or harsh bar soaps.  I love the calming lavender scent.</li>
    <li> It dried my skin out worse than using conventional soaps even using cold water</li>
    <li> I love the way this soap leaves my skin feeling. I suggest you at least try this soap, you will see for yourself.</li>
    <li> Both my eight and five year old also love this product. It&#x27;s natural yet does the job. It lathers well too.</li>
    <li> Just perfect. My skin has never been so soft.</li>
    <li> There is no better soap anywhere. I gave this as a gift to 10 friends. They request it as a Vhristmas present every year.</li>
    <li> Love the goat lavender soap! Smells strong but soothing for the skin!</li>
    <li> I used to get the bath size bar soap at the store, but can&#x27;t find it any more.  I looked on Amazon and found this.  It has a more natural odor instead of perfume, and lathers fast.  The best bar soap I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Have used for years and cannot say enough great things about it. Leaves skin soft without soap residue. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance, bar lasts a long time and cleans well.</li>
    <li> I usually buy handmade goat&#x27;s milk soap, but was looking to save a few bucks.  This soap is ok.  It is very sudsy, non-drying and lasts a good while, but the lavender is barely detectable.  My daughter rebelled and I&#x27;ve gone back to handmade.</li>
    <li> Wonderful soap, smells great, lathers really nicely and is quite a large bar of soap. I&#x27;m very pleased with this.</li>
    <li> This is a gentle clean feeling soap with a soft scent of lavender. There is nothing harsh or abrasive about it. If your skin is sensitive I think you would find it wonderful. If your skin is not sensitive you just might enjoy it anyway.</li>
    <li> The Goat&#x27;s Milk Bar Soap is wonderful. It makes your skin very soft. The Lavender is not overpowering. Will definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> The lavender smell faded after a couple days being out of the box.  I could barely smell it while showering, and the smell was gone by the time I got out.  The soap itself was gentle and fairly moisturizing, but I really wanted the lavender smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this same brand soap at a grocery store some time back.  The packaging was the same and the brand matched (I had the packaging from the old bar) but there were some added ingredients listed. The bar had a different look and left a film when it was used.  Threw it out. I don&#x27;t know which one is the actual soap from this company - one one I bought before or this one so I won&#x27;t be ordering this brand online again.  I&#x27;ll have to see it.</li>
    <li> I am in LOVE!!! I have tried all the different Canus scented soaps and this is by far my favorite. LOVE&lt; LOVE&lt; LOVE&lt; Best soap for people like me with drier skin! I will never use anything else. Great value for a great product.</li>
    <li> Felt like &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; on my skin.  Loved it!</li>
    <li> Got this lavender scent just because i&#x27;m a lavender aholic and will most definitely order again!!! It makes what ever room you put it in smell great. GOOD STUFF</li>
    <li> I tried this brand of soap on a whim after buying a much more expensive soap for my wife. Not only was this product a third of the price but it was superior in every way. For sensitive skin, it rinses off well but also moisturizes gently. The Lavender smell is not overly strong. For anyone possibly considering a similar product I would urge you to give this one a chance.</li>
    <li> Gentle scent. Not overpowering. Goat&#x27;s milk soaps are great for skin softening as well as clearing skin blemishes--never would&#x27;ve thought that, but saves me a lot of money on other products for that issue. Love it!</li>
    <li> Soft, nourishing soap with a subtle sc  ent. Helped tame my skin breakout.</li>
    <li> This soap is super gentle to your skin .It doesn&#x27;t dry you  out ,or have a film .it leaves you clean and fresh with out a  massive chemicals overdose.High quality lavender oil scent . The only down side is they do use Palm Oil  in the ingredients,if you have been keeping up ,Palm oil plantations are totally wiping out Orangutans.The animals are starving because their habitat has been destroyed by Palm plantations .If they try to eat a palm oil seed  ,they are shot ,many are so weak they fall from trees.I am going to write the company and inform them to stop using palm oil .Great product they just need a different oil in the soap.One that doesn&#x27;t cause so much environmental devastation.</li>
    <li> This soap is the greatest, esp. the lavender</li>
    <li> Great soap, and very inexpensive. Had troulbe with dry skin, and this soap doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. Also, my teen son had trouble with face acne, and this soap cleared it up. With a subscription, the price is even better, and free shipping as well. The lavender scent is great, and this soap rinses off very easily with no soap residue. Great product!</li>
    <li> This is a great soap that actually moisturizes your skin and lasts a long time. Plus, the Lavender scent is so soothing and lovely.  I&#x27;m going to continue using it even when Summer arrives.</li>
    <li> flavor is a pleasant combination of goat milk and lavender. Leaved hair shiny and volumized. My favorite soap and the moment. I ordered a triple pack after trying out a single. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Very good product for very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I just received this soap today and have not used it yet but it smells heavenly! I can&#x27;t wait to try it, I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t be unhappy.</li>
    <li> This soap has a lovely scent and makes my skin very soft.</li>
    <li> Became aware of the Canus brand after finding some of their soap at a local Bed Bath &amp; Beyond store. Tried it and liked it much better for the price than the bath soap I used to buy. I purchased the Canus Natural Lavender goat&#x27;s milk soap more out of curiosity as I have not seen this available locally. I found the scent a bit on the strong side at first, but, I guess I got used to it. It is just as good and long-lasting as their other soaps I&#x27;ve tried, but my personal favorite is still their soap with orchid oil with their marigold oil soap a close second. If you like Canus&#x27; soaps, it all boils down to personal preference really.</li>
    <li> Its always a delightful pleasure to open the package and get a big whiff of my beloved lavender fragrance....that, along with the creamy bubbles and skin-softening effects makes this a must have bath luxury! My sister was visiting me in April and smelled it and felt how soft my skin was and just had to have it..I ordered her some and sent it...now she loves it too!</li>
    <li> The lavender in these bars of soap lasts throughout the entire life of the bar.  The fragrance is mild but distinct.  I just love how kind the soap is to my dry skin and the fragrance is a wonderfully soothing scent both for a morning shower before I face the day and for the shower or bath afterwards.</li>
    <li> really works well. mildly scented. suds up well, but not too much. it is great goat milk soap. like it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product; long lasting and very good for my dry skin</li>
    <li> I break out from a lot of soap products, but not this one.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin really soft</li>
    <li> Great product and I love it again for baths.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. I have been looking for it since Whole Foods stopped carrying it.</li>
    <li> Light scent of lavender. Great product that doesn&#x27;t leave your body feeling dry like most detergent bar soaps.</li>
    <li> Too strong of a scent for me.</li>
    <li> Sent it back, has bad ingredients. Would not recommend. Sorry I ordered it. Would not want my family to use it.</li>
    <li> A great product for a great price. Lasts a long time, love the scent.</li>
    <li> Used to have problem with acne.  My dermatologist could not solve it, kept throwing antibiotics at me that only temporarily helped.  Goat milk soap solved that completely.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Doesn&#x27;t stink too bad. Hard to find the unscented at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s something about the way it suds up that feels a little luxurious.  It smells great and seems soothing for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> Send to my wife, she liked it</li>
    <li> I have been using these products for several years. They are very good for sensitive skin. My sisters also use this now. I have skin allergies &amp; this is perfect.</li>
    <li> I am stating categorically, that this is a delight for your skin! I had been using french milled (X4?) soaps for a good while, but discovered when colder weather (Minnesota type) hit, even with using Aveeno after shower oil, it was leaving my skin much too dry. I ordered this [[ASIN:B007I6PSME Canus Vermont Goat&#x27;s Milk Bar Soap, Natural Lavender, 15 Ounce]]soap because I had always heard that goats milk was very nutritious (my dad grew up on it - NO COWS!) and when I read further I found that it&#x27;s composition is similar to our skin (ph, etc.). I ordered this and have been extremely happy with the results. By composition it is a much fattier soap (which is good in my case) ; it cleans very well, love the lavender scent, also. If your soap drys out your skin PLEASE try this - I guarantee you&#x27;ll love the results, and your skin will love the nourishment!!!</li>
