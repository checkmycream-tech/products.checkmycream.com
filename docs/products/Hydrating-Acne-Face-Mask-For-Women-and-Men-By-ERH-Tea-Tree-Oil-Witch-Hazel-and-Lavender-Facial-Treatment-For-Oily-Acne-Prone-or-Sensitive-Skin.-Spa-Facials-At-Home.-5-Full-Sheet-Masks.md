<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is my first time buying a facial mask. So I don&#x27;t have a standard to compare with. But I could feel the difference after I use. Everything works nice except that it is not as efficient as I though to reduce the blackheads.</li>
    <li> Face feels super clean after use!</li>
    <li> I really love these. Great to make you feel refreshed.</li>
    <li> Made my skin soft! Lots of product in each package. I was able to use the serum on my neck and chest.</li>
    <li> Easy to put on. Great packaging and left skin feel smooth and clean. Best mask for the price me and my wife love pampering each other. Great Xmas gift for anyone looking to pamper their other half.</li>
    <li> Love the after feel! Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Love this easy one day mask. It is convenient when you need a quick mask day. The</li>
    <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;After using a week, my skin can see difference.</li>
    <li> I like the masks and how your face feels afterwards but it says not to get in your eyes and the eyeholes are a little small. Also I have sensitive skin and after about 15 minutes my face started itching/burning but when I took it off there wasn&#x27;t any redness. There is plenty solution left in each packet to spread elsewhere as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m acne prone and trying to erase the stress of my college courses with some anti aging. These did not break me out and felt very soothing. Tea tree oil did not sting like other products it&#x27;s found in, might contain less and that&#x27;s why. Would like witch hazel and other quality ingredients to be higher on the list and less filler instead. Anyway, it was worth the price since I didn&#x27;t break out. Really does feel like spa quality mask. Husband is not so sure about it because it makes me look like a serial killer for the 20 minutes I have it on :)</li>
    <li> Great product. Made my skin soooo soft!</li>
    <li> My skin has been through so much and need some tlc.  I bought this facial mask and I am very happy! I have noticed my face smoother, softer and the dark circles, wrinkles lighten up.  With acne scars and sun damage I hope to have a clean, clear skin. My husband who use to work outside also started to use this mask and loves it.</li>
    <li> I had heard about ERH, its founder has a family history of breast cancer so she sought to develop safe skin care products that everyone can use with peace of mind. The product arrived quickly and I tried it immediately. As suggested by the seller, I first warmed the mask in its unopened foil packaging in some warm water so it doesn&#x27;t feel so cold when I put it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask is soaked with a lot of serum and it felt quite comfortable on my face for the 20 minutes that I used it for. I was able to do stuff around the house without it falling off. After using the mask I also rubbed the serum left in the packaging on my neck, hands, arms and legs. My skin felt refreshed and clean afterwards. I know mask treatments need to be used regularly to get the most benefits, so I&#x27;ll keep using it a couple of times a week. This is so much easier to use than the cream mask treatments that you need to scoop out and put on your face.</li>
    <li> The first thingt I found that I love about this mask is that it comes really nicely packaged.  I can easily see putting these in a basket with &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; things, for a gift.  I have been using other face masks, and because I have long nails, it is kind of a pain to get them out of the jars.  I end up with stuff under my nails and it&#x27;s just a hot mess.  With these Facial Masks, I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore!!  The best part about these is the easy clean up.  When your done, all you do is throw it away!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got these,  I was super excited to use them  So that same night, I washed my face as normal, and applied the Facial Mask to my face.  I walked around cleaning and going about my evening and left it on for about 20 minutes.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my face was after using this.  To be completely honest , I was a little shocked.  I didn&#x27;t really think they were going to do as good a job as my other mask, but I was so wrong!  I haven&#x27;t yet talked my husband into using them, and am thinking seriously about waiting until he is asleep, and just using them on him then.  How great would it be to have him wake up, super soft and realize it was the mask that did it!!??  I truly think that this is a great value for skin care and would recommend it highly.  I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and all thoughts reflected in this review are</li>
    <li> mask are really good your face will feel refresh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this once so far but noticed a visible difference in my skin tone as soon as I took it off, and have continued to see a difference since. I wish they were more affordable so I could purchase them regularly.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this mask .. It works very well and I will keep ordering it.. Also shipping was a good speed..</li>
    <li> This mask made my skin feel spectacular</li>
    <li> These masks are very wet when you remove from the package, but very easily applied.  They feel great, no problems with irritation.  Makes you feel very pampered.</li>
    <li> Decided to have a mother-daughter day and gave the masks a try. Easy to use , it left our faces feeling revitalized and fresh. Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product. The masks are packaged nicely in sealed pouches. I just opened the pouch and applied the mask to my face. Other than startling myself when I looked in the mirror (I looked like Jason from the Friday the 13th movies.), the mask was cool and comfortable. I&#x27;d imagine that these would be great to use during the hot days of summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept the mask on for about a half-hour. I didn&#x27;t have much trouble keeping it on, though I wasn&#x27;t particularly active while wearing it. After removing the mask, my skin was soft and smooth with no irritation or redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice product!</li>
    <li> I received one from a friend and I just love how this product made my skin feel so soft and smooth!  Definitely worth the price!!!!!</li>
    <li> Good product. I give this 5 stars. My only complaint would be the box arrived damaged.</li>
    <li> This m as kes my face soft and smooth. I can&#x27;t wait to use another one.</li>
    <li> My face was so refreshed after using this facial mask!</li>
    <li> This mask is easy to use.  Fits great with cutouts for you eyes nose &amp; mouth.  I felt refreshed after I used it.  I will defiantly be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing and skin clarifying</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic and is of really great quality! Plan on ordering more :)</li>
    <li> Great Masks. I tried on last night, I left it on for about 30 min while watching a movie. My skin feels great this morning, very smooth, and skin color is brighter too. I would imaging after using the whole box, I will be 5 years younger, :) Will def. buy it again.</li>
    <li> Just reading the ingredients of these face mask made them an absolute must for me. All of these ingredients are incredibly healthy for your skin. The witch hazel is calming so if you have sensitive skin this should help. Tea tree oil has been a natural remedy for YEARS! I think using products that have natural ingredients to keep our skin looking healthy and moisturized is a must. I just pop this lovely mask on and enjoy some tv and when I take it off I can&#x27;t stop touching my soft skin!!!! I usually order my masks straight from Koren but now I have something I love just the same! Great product and price.</li>
    <li> After using one I can already see a difference in my face, a lot more softwr</li>
    <li> Very cool and soothing.  My skin was very soft and hyrdated after using it once</li>
    <li> My skin was so soft after using these!  Awesome and easy!</li>
    <li> Each single use mask is made of high quality Japanese silk and this fabric is infused with natural plant derived ingredients like burdock root, lavender, tea tree oil, and witch hazel. All USDA certified organic, hypo-allergenic, oil free, alcohol free, paraben free and....cruelty free with no animal testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to use as you just take the mask right out of the package and place it on your face. There are holes for your eyes and mouth, as well as a way to fit it right on your nose - and still be able to breathe! I liked using this right out of the shower and they also suggest it&#x27;s great to use after exfoliating your skin, when it&#x27;s really in need of hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it a little awkward around my mouth - it kept wanting to cover my upper lip - and there seemed to be an excess of product - it was literally dripping off the mask when I took it out of the package....so I was worried with the &#x27;keep away from eyes&#x27; warning! Fortunately, it didn&#x27;t get in my eyes and after keeping it on my face for 20 minutes (it&#x27;s easier if you lay down and just relax vs trying to multi-task anything with it on), I removed it and wiped the remaining product into my face --- and the rest of it on my neck, arms, legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved how soft and hydrated my skin felt after I used the ERH Repair Mask - even hours after using it, my skin feels so much better. I do feel like there is so much extra liquid left over -- it almost feels wasteful throwing it away after one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve fluctuated between giving this 4 or 5 stars...I was thinking 4 stars for just too much product left over and being a little drippy, but ultimately I need to rate on how well it worked on my skin (which is the most important part, right?!) - and I love how my skin looks and feels when I use these masks....so 5 stars for that!!  I received this for review purposes &amp; the above review is based on my honest opinion of this product and hope it helps you!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a mask that is gentle and soothing...i think i have found it! I was worried that worth the tea tree oil,  it might be a little harsh,  but i wrong! I gave it 4 stars because it is a little messy. I will probably only use these once a week,  but I will reorder some of these in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> Big difference right away. These masks are awesome.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try a paper mask. I had no clue what to expect and when I opened the packaging I was very pleased. The only thing I would have liked but maybe Cannot be controlled is the amount of serum on the mask it was very wet. But I put it on and I looked weird almost ghost like in it but it felt great on my skin. I left the the mask on for 15 min and then I took it off and there was a lot of residue from the serum but I just did what the directions said , massage rest of serum onto face. I tell you this product is fantastic and I did not break out from it and it actually toned down some of my red blemishes I had on my face over night. I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used this item 2 times so far. it makes my face so smooth for 2 days after i use it!</li>
    <li> I am so loving the way my face feels after using the cloths!</li>
    <li> Sensitive to my skin, but overall works good!</li>
    <li> This here was very decieving the mask is very small would fit my 4yr old child.. i was not excited when i opened it.. does not cover all of the face the pictures made it look bigger then it really is.... not happy with this one sorry</li>
    <li> Very good product and it did repair your skin significantly!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love. Helped to calm me skin as I suffer from Rosacea. So much serum on the mask that the mask doesn&#x27;t dry out and you can massage into face and neck when time is up. I highly recommend. I just bought the anti-aging to try it.</li>
    <li> my daughter and I LOVE these. we do girls night and do facials and all that. well these are the best facial mask ever.  you fell so refreshed and renewed when youre done. any women who really wants to do her facials in the comfort of her own home.....these are the ones!!! I will be buying more of these for sure</li>
    <li> I am in love with these masks!! They really are one of the best sheet masks I have ever used compared to other ones.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Feels good and keeps my face moistured. Will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter and she absolutely loves the way her skin feels after using the facial mask.</li>
    <li> I love these masks!! They are great. They left my skin feeling so refreshed!</li>
    <li> I finally had a chance to use this product today an i absolutely love it, right after my skin was baby butt smooth</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised how good these masks are. Each mask is dripping wet, so you know you are getting the maximum out of each use. I only wore it 10 minutes the first time since I have very sensitive skin. The mask had a cooling sensation that was nice. Once I pulled the mask off and rubbed the remaining product in, my skin was smooth and soft. No irritation, which is unusual for me trying anything new. Very excited to keep using them!</li>
    <li> Can I say how absolutely in love with this product I am?!?! Soooooo worth every penny and there&#x27;s no price tag on beauty!!! My face was beyond refreshed and just felt hydrated!! Two thumbs up</li>
    <li> I received the ERH Repair Essence Facial Mask and the first time I put it on I sat back and reclined my chair and felt like I was at a spa. Within a few seconds I started to feel such a refreshing feeling on my face. It was slightly cold but felt so good. It felt as if my face was being massaged. I left it on the amount of time recommended probably even a little longer. When I took it off it was like a clear cream on my face. I massaged the rest of it into my face and let it dry. I have oily skin but after it dried my face was oil free and felt great. The masks are very easy to put on. I highly recommend these Facial masks to everyone.</li>
    <li> Free Product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a box of 5 face masks.  Each one is individually wrapped.  The directions say to use one or two a week.&lt;br /&gt;Opening the pack, they are very wet, with a paper backing that is removed, and then the mask is applied to the face.&lt;br /&gt;I found them to be very cold, but they are easily warmed by letting the unopened pack sit in hot water for a few minutes before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They smell very nice.  They contain tea tree oil, which is quite healing and antibacterial, along with other herbs and hyaluronic acid.  I’ve left mine on, as directed, for about 20 minutes, then when I take it off, I rub the extra moisture into my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They leave my face feeling very hydrated, and smooth.  I can see where these would minimize pores though mine are already very small.  I can feel a bit of astringent action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These masks are pleasant to use though they do take a while, and the white infused material makes me look a bit like Jason from Friday 13th while it is on.  It’s kind of funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has my skin benefited? I think in a subtle way, yes. My face has definitely been very clear while I’ve been using them, and under-eye crepe has been on the retreat.  I’m impressed that a mask that is astringent and pore reducing is also quite hydrating.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I used the facial just before going on vacation.  I had a great pro facial in Italy just last week. The difference?  $ and I didn&#x27;t massage my face. I like the product even more now.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice mask. I tried it and it felt so wonderful on my face. It had my skin feeling so soft and fresh. The mask might look a little silly on your face but you will be happy with the end results.</li>
    <li> The box arrive intact. I&#x27;ve been sick over the holidays and I haven&#x27;t had a chance to relax and try the mask out but as soon as I can, will will come back and write a review on my experience. Thank you ERG Group!</li>
    <li> I love everything about this mask except for the holes for the eye and where the nose is. I ended up using my scissors and cutting slits so my eyes would be comfortable and so that the mask would lie flat on my nose area, and part of my forehead between my eyebrows. Other than that, I loved how it felt! The smell is very nice and my skin was very smooth after taking the mask off. how refreshing.</li>
    <li> I have bought it for 3 times. Very good mask and worth the price.</li>
    <li> I loved the face mask! It made my skin feel soft and rejuvenated. I will definitely be purchasing again in the future. These will make great bachelorette party gifts for the girls.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and packaging.  Excellent customer service and follow-up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super picky with what I put on my face. I&#x27;m a Product snob! I have always wanted to try this type of mask so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. Wow! I loved the way my skin felt after I used this! It was honestly the first time in a super long time that I looked in the mirror and was like you don&#x27;t need foundation. I was actually please with my bare skin!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is very soothing and healing. I put the used mask in a baggie and use the residual gel in between masks.</li>
    <li> These masks had a pleasant smell and a nice cooling sensation when applied. I was a little apprehensive trying a mask for the first time (I have fairly sensitive skin) but these did not irritate my skin whatsoever. I would suggest using these masks while lying down as the treatment is a little messy and the eye, nose, and mouth holes might not be perfectly suited to everyone&#x27;s face shape.</li>
    <li> I tried this mask and it was so cool and refreshing. There was no odor that I could tell and my skin looked great when I took it off after 20 minutes. I liked it that it didn&#x27;t take long to keep on my face since it felt a little slimy.</li>
    <li> Outstanding customer service, the product is fabulous as well.</li>
    <li> The mask is plastic and the goo is inside it. It is supposed to stay in place once applied but it moves around. My skin felt nicer after using this but it&#x27;s a rather cumbersome experience. The mask does not look like the one pictured, which appears more rigid and something that keeps its shape.</li>
    <li> I do not like getting facials at the spa - the steam is an issue for me.  So I wasn&#x27;t sure about this but I wanted to try.  I have used two of these facial masks already and I am sold!  They go on easily and it stayed on the entire time I left it on (18 minutes).  The best part was when I took it off.  My face felt so soft.  And it felt invigorated!  I am going to make this my special treat once a week!</li>
    <li> will make a good gift for my Mom.</li>
    <li> These masks are amazing! I received them quickly and they work very well for my skin. My skin feels so soft after using them. I will definitely be buying these again!</li>
    <li> so gentle and relaxing!  I am so pleased!  I will be purchasing this again.  I am also a redhead with freckles and super sensitive skin so fear not!</li>
    <li> I LOVE these masks, that make your skin feel feel clean and refreshed. I have sensitive skin and they work great</li>
    <li> It was nice, but I honestly didn&#x27;t notice any difference after use. The product also was &amp;#34;too small&amp;#34; for my face. I guess i have a large head, but the product only covered half of my forehead.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this product.  It is especially unique as it is made from natural plant based products.</li>
    <li> These are amazing! I will definately be stocking up on these for myself and my family as gifts</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Great stuff!</li>
    <li> These are wonderful relaxing and great for my skin and totally recommend it</li>
    <li> I just tried this new mask that I got to review. At first I was a bit leary of it since its not your typical type of mask. But I can say that Im shocked with the change in my skin texture after using it. My face feels like a babies skin!!! Its a must try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Love this face mask - highly recommend! I have more dry skin especially this time of year, the winter air is so rough on my skin. This mask left my face feeling awesome! Smooth and refreshed, I could really tell a difference. I would recommend to even leave it on a little longer than the 15-20 mins that is recommended. Great product!</li>
    <li> Love facial masks.  This is a great product.  No irritation to my skin at all.</li>
    <li> Great product. Get a spa experience at home. Excellent selller.</li>
    <li> These masks are really easy to use!</li>
    <li> Loved my 1st mask! Made my skin feel so soft- I&#x27;m looking forward to the results after several uses.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive my facial repair kit. Perfect fit to the face... And smells great</li>
    <li> Product just as described. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> It was ok.... The mask didn&#x27;t want to stay on right at all. A girlfriend and I did it together and we kept laughing saying our faces were melting off because they just kept slipping! Everything came on time and packaged great. The mask itself felt good and made my skin feel nice after but nothing miraculous....</li>
    <li> Great facial and quick ship. Would reccomend their product highly. Stop going to the salon for facials do it yourself in minutes at home.</li>
    <li> I received a sample from the manufacturer for my honest opinion of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made my husband try these out with me, he really didn&#x27;t want to but I made him dinner so he had to. :) After washing our faces and getting past the first 5 minutes of non stop snickering, bad jokes, and belly laughs as we looked at each other wearing our masks, we got them straightened out enough and onto our faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We warmed up the packs in warm water before we opened them which helped them feel nicer. The holes that go around your eyes didn&#x27;t fit too well so the mask didn&#x27;t sit flush onto the skin around our eyes. I think if the area around the eye holes were split a little it would make it easier to shape around your cheek/under eye area. It does say not to use close to your eyes but the way the holes are placed it still gets pretty close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once on, the masks stay in place very well and they do  have a pleasant smell. I tried smoothing my mask out but there were still a few wrinkled areas. I did smooth some of the excess solution onto my neck area.  After leaving on for 20 minutes we removed our masks and rubbed what was left of the solution into our skin. I did notice the areas of the mask that was wrinkled while I was wearing it actually left wrinkles in my face in the same place,...like the creases you see from your pillow when you wake up in the morning. But after massaging the remaining solution into my face they went away, it was just strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After removing our masks our faces felt a bit gummy while the solution dried and soaked into our skin, it seemed like it took about 30-45 minutes or so for it to finish soaking into our skin (even after rubbing the excess in). Within an hour though our skin felt smoother, softer and very, very nice! I really like how this mask made my face feel, even my husbands face felt softer. I didn&#x27;t want to waste what was left of the solution on my mask so before tossing the mask away I rubbed the rest onto  my hands, arms, and elbows. Since I use more &#x27;good&#x27; products on my face than I do on my arms and hands, I noticed more of a difference on my arms, and especially my elbows! I know this is a face mask, but I really love how smooth my elbows feel. The next time I use one of these masks  I am going to try some of the remaining solution on my heels to see how that works.ince I use more &#x27;good&#x27; products on my face than I do on my arms and hands, I noticed more of a difference on my arms, and especially my elbows!

    <li> This simple facial mask was so much easier to apply than the goopy masks that come in a tub, and after the first use I felt that my skin was smooth, tight, and very soft. The fragrance was light and natural, and I appreciated that it has a number of natural ingredients. I received a sample for review, but I genuinely enjoyed using this mask.</li>
    <li> Great product for a spa like feeling at home.</li>
    <li> Mother in law loves it, it really does make her skin look refreshed!</li>
    <li> Loves these.  Leaves my face feeling refreshed however they do look a little creepy, lol.</li>
    <li> I have used a few times &amp; it is nice.  The mask is easy to use &amp; put on your face, really a lot of product on the mask, almost too much.  My skin is softer after using, felt nice &amp; hydrated. For me, not something I would use every day but once a week. Will update after more uses.</li>
    <li> I love face masks, so getting to try this one out at a discounted price was really awesome! The best part? These masks are USDA-certified organic, Hypoallergenic, Alcohol-Free, Oil-Free, Paraben-Free, and Cruelty-free/No Animal Testing!! All a huge plus in my book, because I have very sensitive skin. I warmed up the mask in some hot water first for about 10 minutes. I was surprised to see the mask is saturated so much, but happy as well so it can work deep into the skin. It wasn&#x27;t hard to apply at all, but would do this over the bathroom sink and with a mirror help to adjust it to your face properly. It really felt nice on my face as I sat around in my bathrobe enjoying some relaxation time. After roughly 15 minutes I took off the mask and enjoyed how refreshed and soft my skin felt.</li>
    <li> my skin feel great after this mask, and it is very easy to use</li>
    <li> Great product! Exactly as described! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> These face mask are amazing. I&#x27;ve never used a whole face mask like this before so when I was offered to review this I was excited. I first ran the foil pack they come in under hot water to warm it up. The mask is kind of slimy but feel great once on. The mask is a little hard to get just right with the first use but once you get the hand of it, it is easy. The mask feel great while on and you can feel it working. It also smell great. 20 minute later I peeled it off. My face felt amazing and so refreshed. It really helped my oily but dry skin.</li>
    <li> Fresh feeling, but a little tricky to put on without getting it in your eyes.</li>
    <li> I love using these facial masks, purchased via a special promotion. They are a convenient way to condition my skin.  They are very moist and can be \\&quot;recycled\\&quot; onto the neck or other area after using on the face.  I have enlarged pores on my nose and chin as well as excessive sebum in those areas, and after using the mask, it seems to draw the sebum to the surface where it can be easily removed.</li>
    <li> my face has never been so soft and smooth love it</li>
    <li> Awesome! There isn&#x27;t much else to say. Love it!</li>
    <li> Did not fit well and didn&#x27;t notice any changes or improvements.</li>
    <li> After using many different products. .this truly gives a soft and youthful feel!</li>
    <li> I bought these ERH facial masks as a gift for my friend and she was so happy when she received them. She loves the idea of having a relaxing facial in the comfort of her own home for a tiny fraction of the cost of a resort spa treatment. And this facial mask is so easy to use. She loves it so much that she&#x27;s shared the masks with her friends.</li>
    <li> I love this mask. Makes your face feel really good!</li>
    <li> These masks are amazing! I couldn&#x27;t believe the results after I used the first one! My mom was so impressed she begged me to share them :) definitely a great buy!</li>
    <li> I want to get some of these for myself, my mother used them and omg what an awesome face mask!! I am excited to get some for myself for xmas!</li>
    <li> These little mask are great!  My skin feels and smells great after using them. Great part to any skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I opened one to try it out and I love how it makes my face feel! There&#x27;s 5 in a pack and I may need to get some more!</li>
    <li> easy to use! great product. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> OMG! This product is AMAZBALLLLLS. I love it, it made my skin feel so rejuvenated and alive! It was really gentle on my sensitive skin and the mask itself was loaded with serum and felt great as soon as it touched my skin. Loved the fact that it wasn&#x27;t dried out, and I could leave it on my skin without it feeling too heavy or dried. If you want to try a new face mask, almost instant results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes your skin feel so so good, and the quality of the materials wasn&#x27;t cheap. I usually get facials monthly, but this is a decent substitution when I don&#x27;t have time. You can do it at home and it&#x27;s almost like a DIY spa face and a party for your face. I recommend this highly. Plus they are local (at least for me in the Bay Area!)</li>
    <li> The mask smells great and my skin definitely felt more refreshed and replenished after. There was a good amount of serum on the mask so I could actually walk around the house doing things without it falling off. I would definitely recommend this and I am going to buy it again.</li>
    <li> So easy to use.  I live this product.</li>
    <li> Just received this and it works great!  I plan on using it twice a week as directed.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try it. My friend loves it</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> These face masks are great!  I used it after cleansing my face for the recommended time and I ave to say, it felt amazing. With a busy life its harx to get to a spa, so this is a great alternative.  My face felt smooth and refreshed after using it and the smell is great! Plus its made with natural ingredients,  which is great for me. I suffer from eczema, so i cannot use anything with strong chemicals or odors and this did not break my skin! Great product will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great gift...My wife loves these...Shipped fast too</li>
    <li> So my daughter has always been prone to acne...I got these for my honest and unbiased review and well.... I noticed immediately that what acne she had on her face was less red... her skin didn&#x27;t look so shiny and oily... I only used the one on her -- I wanted to make sure she wasn&#x27;t going to have a reaction you never know, and so far its been nothing but great..  I will continue to use these for her skin... it helped so much in one application but I do recommend to do the instructions for warming as it does make them feel so much more like a spa feeling...</li>
    <li> I felt like I went to a spa , my skin  is softer.  I will experiment on my Hubz tonight!</li>
    <li> After use it, my skin become very well. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and a great mask!</li>
    <li> Feels refreshing!  Skin looks and feels better!</li>
    <li> Skin is silky smooth after using and is helping with blemishes. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that I was not a fan of this product. The mask itself is slimy to the touch and is not a &amp;#34;one size fits all faces&amp;#34;. I couldn&#x27;t keep it on for the recommended 15 minutes because it was getting in my eyes, which burned like hell. I took it off and did not rinse per the directions. My face was super sticky after. Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Soothing and relaxing. These make a wonderful gift for my friends.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working great! This was much cheaper than paying for my partners botox!</li>
    <li> I warmed the mask as other reviewers suggested and really like it. It says several times to not get in the eye, but the eye holes are super small. The other openings are placed well. The mask feels slightly gooey but absorbs into the skin and feels cooling.</li>
    <li> I love the convenience and ease of this mask.  There&#x27;s a lot of product on the mask (which can make it a little messy to apply), but I take the excess and wipe it down my neck.  It tingles and my face continues to feel refreshed after!</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  I can&#x27;t do spa facials because getting products on my face in a dark room makes me panic but...these little masks are fantastic. They are super light and fit right to the skin with the moisterizing product against it. They are cold at first but warm up quickly. I then smoothed them out over my face. The eye holes, nose and mouth were perfect. I am hooked on these. My face was so soft after. It felt refreshed, smooth and clean. My makeup went on super smooth. It was my way of a facial without the expense of the spa.</li>
    <li> I loved this product. My skin is so soft and I really liked the smell. I have extremely oily skin and very cautious of using these type products but it was wonderful and relaxing. I will definitely use this product again.</li>
    <li> Was different than any mask I have ever tried....it is an actual mask! I followed others suggestion and warmed up the mask before applying. Easy to use and very comfortable while waiting for the mask to do its thing. My face felt refreshed and invigorated afterwards. I look forward to using every time!</li>
    <li> Who loves to get a facial?  Me!  But unfortunately I can&#x27;t ever do it because they are so expensive and I can&#x27;t afford it.  But these are awesome and they can give you the same results at home that you get at a spa - just add in some soothing music and burn some essential oils and you have it made!  For a LOT less money :)  These are made from Japanese silk too, which makes them soooo soft and comfortable.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about putting nasty chemicals on your skin either as these are Organic, Hypoallergenic, Alcohol-Free, Oil-Free, and Paraben-Free.  And ERH does NOT test on animals either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are really easy to apply - they recommend using them after showering because your pores are open to the great ingredients they contain.  Just open the packet and pull out the mask, put it on your face and wait 15-20 minutes!  Seriously that is all you have to do.  Witch hazel, tea tree oil and lavender promise that you will get a great experience with these masks.  It really does help with acne and clearing up your skin, and only cost a little over $5.00 a treatment - try and get a facial for that price at a spa or salon!  So give them a try - you have nothing to lose because they offer a money-back guarantee.  I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
    <li> This is a great rejuvenation mask. After a long week I like to put one on and relax while listening to music!</li>
    <li> Love this mask. Left my skin rejuvenated, soft and glowing.</li>
    <li> I really love the way that this makes your skin look and feel. I was a little bit concerned about the holes for your eyes. I had to cut the side because I felt that it was too close to the corner of my eyes. The company might want to consider using less fluid on this mask. It was excessively moist felt like you could have used it more then once. But other then that its a good product. &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great face masks. Very simple to use and I really feel like I&#x27;m pampering myself.</li>
    <li> These made my face feel so amazing!! My pores looked smaller after using too.</li>
    <li> fantastic!  I love it...would purchase again for sure!</li>
    <li> My skin feels super moist and plump after just one use. I just had a facial a few days ago at a high-end spa and I feel that I can replicate the moisture and tone through these masks. Yes, they are drippy but use the excess liquid wisely and put it on your neck and chest. I will continue buying these!</li>
    <li> This product feels slimy while on, however, after taking it off it felt nice and refreshing. My skin was soft for hours afterward. Good product.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Leaves your face fresh and revitalized.</li>
    <li> I have used 2 so far and love the way it leaves my skin soft. there is a lot of the product and its slimy but I just added it on and kept rubbing it around.&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and I&#x27;m hoping it helps with it, if I keep up with using the masks.</li>
    <li> Love this facial mask! It smells great and it made my face feel wonderful after using it. I like that it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients and that it&#x27;s very gentle on your skin. I highly recommend this facial mask product for both men and women!</li>
    <li> I have only just received it but I have enjoy the first two uses of it.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try these facial mask!!! I have very oily skin and oh gosh don&#x27;t let me get on the acne! I decided to wait until night to try my mask because I wanted to be relaxed . So I opened the box and it comes with 5 individually wrapped mask. The directions say leave on for 15-20 minutes . When I opened the pack I noticed it was soaked in a really soft serum so I unfolded my mask and put it on my face. (Remember to clean your face before you try your mask!! ) I removed the paper that the mask came in and smoothed it out over my face. It&#x27;s totally like a spa treatment!! I felt a tingling  sensation that felt like it was working my pores over. After 20 mins I took the mask off  and got the excess serum off my face felt incredible! It was so smooth and it even look like it lighted my skin up or maybe evened my skintone! So I&#x27;m definitely buying more of these! This was a discounted item used for review and I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Tried this the other night and it left my skin refreshed and soft. Pores were less noticeable and the best part was that there was no mess! I also have sensitive skin and this did not irritate my skin at all. Very happy with this.</li>
    <li> This is a good hydrating mask with out the sticky feeling once you take it off. It is very soothing.</li>
    <li> These are WAY too big for my petite face. I tried one and wasn&#x27;t amazed with how it made my skin feel afterwards, but it did feel cleaner and fresher. I&#x27;ll use them again but I won&#x27;t make a habit out of it.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend really like this mask.</li>
</ol>
