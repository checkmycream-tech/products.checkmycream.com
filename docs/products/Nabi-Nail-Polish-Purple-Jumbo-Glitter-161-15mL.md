      <li>If you like intense color shift effects and a unique, eye catching look, this is great!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty, but not THAT great.</li>
      <li>While the polish does have a pretty strong odor, it is a really beautiful glitter polish.</li>
      <li>so top coat is recommended.  </li>
      <li>Love It..</li>
      <li>love the color.</li>
      <li>picture looks better.</li>
      <li>I think she will really love it because she collects nail polish.</li>
      <li>Oh and arrived in 3-4 days from placing order :)</li>
      <li>I just love this.</li>
      <li>I love the glitter combo in this polish.</li>
      <li>Great price n great product nice n thick</li>
      <li>It looks great over many different colors.</li>
      <li>The glitter &#x27;disperses&#x27; easily</li>
      <li>Like burn your nose hair strong.</li>
      <li>smell is kinda strong if you care about that sort of thing but goes away immediately</li>
      <li>This Is Such A Great Polish &amp; I</li>
      <li>I put it on over a medium-light blue and turned out very NICE.  </li>
      <li>AND it comes off super easy.</li>
      <li>You need 3-4 coats over a opaque color to truely see the shimmer.</li>
      <li>I love this polish so much.</li>
      <li>Not bad.</li>
      <li>Not bad though.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been going thru this bottle faster than any other I have lol.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like the image shown, however it is a very pretty pink/glittery color.</li>
      <li>the colors are very pretty</li>
      <li>This is a very pretty polish but in no way is it a Purple Jumbo Glitter.</li>
      <li>The product was here on time and exactly as promised!</li>
      <li>Glitter spreads really evenly and the micro glitter elements of this polish are so fine that it looks like a holo.</li>
      <li>I love the way this looks, but it took FOREVER to solidify and stayed soft for hours.</li>
      <li>Gorgeous polish, but not quite as pink as the picture suggests</li>
      <li>Kleancolor seems to work, but it also takes many coats, and sometimes it looks matte, so it needs clear coat too.</li>
      <li>Not as colorful as picture.</li>
      <li>I put it on my nails and it had a nice interesting pink, but I still don&#x27;t think it has as much multicolor, as the picture.  </li>
      <li>Okay.. This is a little more orange than anything</li>
      <li>Shipping was super fast and no leakage or problems.</li>
      <li>It came super fast &amp; was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Also, each time I used the polish (over another color) it chipped and peeled off the next day, and that&#x27;s with a quality top coat.</li>
      <li>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</li>
      <li>Until this moment, I was sure that I received the correct nail polish that looks different than the picture.</li>
      <li>I was kinda skeptic at first when I bought this cause</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t wait to send it to my friend!</li>
      <li>Love it the different size glitter chunks, it really creates a sense of depth.</li>
      <li>in person, its a very light pink with colored &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34; - not shiny at all.</li>
      <li>It looks pretty on any color (right now i have it on an orangey pink-sounds weird but looks great--</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>i had it on light blue).</li>
      <li>And it is very time consuming to remove.</li>
      <li>It iwill look nice for a top coat over a pink or peach color or it would lok good over black or navy blue or any dark color.</li>
      <li>(even China Glaze)that are gritty like sand, and I ended up putting coat after coat of clear polish to try to smooth it out</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t chip or peel off for a long time, it makes my pedicures last so much longer and look so much better.</li>
      <li>I really was pleasantly surprised with this glitter polish.  </li>
      <li>this is definitely the right polish</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not very sheer, I mean, you need to apply a few layers to have an intense coverage, but the look is awesome!</li>
      <li>But what I like about China Glaze&#x27;s kaleidoscope nail polishes is that the finish is smooth, not gritty or rough.</li>
      <li>they look different on the web page but very close in color in person</li>
      <li>This is a very pretty glitter to use over other polish.</li>
      <li>Polish color is kind of thin</li>
      <li>Looks adorable pink and iridescent in the bottle, slap this on over a pitch black, and BLAM</li>
      <li>Its a really pretty color, but like other reviewers I wouldn&#x27;t say it was purple.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this polish is really pretty, but it is not purple like described, it&#x27;s more like pink and orange.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a glitter top coat in a clear peachy pink base with mostly warm gold pink iridescent clear glitters of varying sizes and occasional purple glitters.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s super thick and doesn&#x27;t apply well.  </li>
      <li>After one nail chipped and I wanted to remove the polish, I was able to literally peel the polish right off in one piece :(</li>

<li> Super thick Polish,  takes a long time dry.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really thick and loaded with so much glitter one coat is all you need!</li>
<li> Only while its wet tho.</li>
<li> Who wants thick polish???</li>
<li> Very glittery and thick.</li>
<li> I tried Color Club, but it took a long time to dry and smudged too.</li>
<li> takes a long time to dry through</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t call this a polish, it definitely needs to be layered over other colors.  </li>
<li> Wish I would have known this was a &amp;#34;new, improved THICKER formula&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t dry.</li>
<li> It does smell a bit, although it goes away when completely dry.</li>
<li> Not at all what I expected.</li>
<li> it looks really pink in the picture</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t wait to try it with a lavender or baby pink.</li>
<li> Not what I expected.</li>
<li> and it isn&#x27;t purple but pink.</li>
<li> Pink in color, not purple.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not sure if I just got a bad one or what, but it&#x27;s super thick and doesn&#x27;t apply well.  I&#x27;m disappointed... it looks amazing in the jar.</li>
    <li> Adds interest over lots of other colors. Colored hologram glitter adds interest without being harshly metallic. I&#x27;ve been going thru this bottle faster than any other I have lol.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it, awesome color &amp; arrived as fast as promised!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like the image shown, however it is a very pretty pink/glittery color. Would have given it 5 stars if I actually received what I paid for. Smh</li>
    <li> I was kinda skeptic at first when I bought this cause it looks really pink in the picture but I read a lot of review about putting it over black polish.  I tried and it looks AMAZING!</li>
    <li> While the polish does have a pretty strong odor, it is a really beautiful glitter polish. Glitter spreads really evenly and the micro glitter elements of this polish are so fine that it looks like a holo. I just love this.</li>
    <li> Very glittery and thick. Use it a lot.</li>
    <li> I really liked this nail polish. It&#x27;s not very sheer, I mean, you need to apply a few layers to have an intense coverage, but the look is awesome!</li>
    <li> Wish I would have known this was a &amp;#34;new, improved THICKER formula&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t dry. Goopy. Who wants thick polish???</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product . I would order again. It was shipped on time .</li>
    <li> Pink in color, not purple.  Not at all what I expected.</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty polish but in no way is it a Purple Jumbo Glitter. It is a pinkish orange colored gel polish with different sizes of glitter. It iwill look nice for a top coat over a pink or peach color or it would lok good over black or navy blue or any dark color.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of holographic, glitter,and kaleidoscope nail polishes. China Glaze is my favorite, but they have discontinued their lines of those and now what is left of them are outrageously priced.. not that I haven&#x27;t indulged and bought them anyway ;) But what I like about China Glaze&#x27;s kaleidoscope nail polishes is that the finish is smooth, not gritty or rough. I have bought others (even China Glaze)that are gritty like sand, and I ended up putting coat after coat of clear polish to try to smooth it out but then it is too thick and just smudges, then I have to start all over. Unless I want to sit still for over an hour without moving. And it is very time consuming to remove. Any suggestions out there? Recommendations? I tried Color Club, but it took a long time to dry and smudged too. Kleancolor seems to work, but it also takes many coats, and sometimes it looks matte, so it needs clear coat too. Any help would be greatly appreciated! I&#x27;d like to order this product here but I&#x27;m afraid it won&#x27;t be what I&#x27;m looking for. Help please! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Not as colorful as picture. You need 3-4 coats over a opaque color to truely see the shimmer. Not bad though.</li>
    <li> I love the glitter combo in this polish. The only problem,  and the reason why I gave this 3 stars, is after only one application on my toes this polish became goopy. I will add thinner to it but feel it should have taken longer for this to  happen.</li>
    <li> The items where delivered on time.I have not used the product I ordered two bottles they look different on the web page but very close in color in person i should have ordered one bottle but I have them now overall the colors are very pretty I&#x27;m happy with the choices I made</li>
    <li> Although this product was Late on delivery. Its still as promised. Looks just lke the picture and the the Glitter in the polish is BEAUTIFUL!!! I contacted the seller about the product being late and they got back to me right away. Awesome Customer service and i will be ordering from them again! Thank you</li>
    <li> clumpy, gooey, yucky, useless gel. its like putting jello on your nails. picture looks better. in person, its a very light pink with colored &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34; - not shiny at all.</li>
    <li> Kinda thick and takes too long to dry</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty glitter to use over other polish. Love it the different size glitter chunks, it really creates a sense of depth.</li>
    <li> Polish color is kind of thin but if you want lots of chunky glitter this is definitely the right polish</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call this a polish, it definitely needs to be layered over other colors.  I tried a few different colors but dark blue, purple, and black were my favorites.  It is duochrome and gives off colors from a coppery reddish color to gold to orange.  There are also some holographic glitters in there that glow blue and purple.  It is full of awesomeness!!!!!</li>
    <li> This polish peels offer your nails after it is in the drying machine.  Very disappointed with this product.  This is not what is advertised.</li>
    <li> very sweet!  Colors are not too out there, but with enough flash to get attentionQ</li>
    <li> Not bad. Not what I expected. I ordered purple jumbo glitter and it isn&#x27;t purple but pink. Nice color and nail polish but not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Its a really pretty color, but like other reviewers I wouldn&#x27;t say it was purple. It&#x27;s a glitter top coat in a clear peachy pink base with mostly warm gold pink iridescent clear glitters of varying sizes and occasional purple glitters. It is rather thick and a little gloopy though.</li>
    <li> I love this polish! It does smell a bit, although it goes away when completely dry. Shipping was super fast and no leakage or problems.</li>
    <li> Love this polish! It&#x27;s really thick and loaded with so much glitter one coat is all you need!</li>
    <li> I really was pleasantly surprised with this glitter polish.  It is gorgeous!  It does have a lot of purple glitter, a lot of gold.  But they are holo, giving off a rainbow effect of also pinks, a little blue, a little green.  I put it on over a medium-light blue and turned out very NICE.  The glitter &#x27;disperses&#x27; easily so u don&#x27;t have to keep dabbing &amp; adjusting the glitters.  It is &#x27;chunky&#x27; feeling so top coat is recommended.  Oh and arrived in 3-4 days from placing order :)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this polish is really pretty, but it is not purple like described, it&#x27;s more like pink and orange. Also, each time I used the polish (over another color) it chipped and peeled off the next day, and that&#x27;s with a quality top coat. After one nail chipped and I wanted to remove the polish, I was able to literally peel the polish right off in one piece :(</li>
    <li> I think I got the wrong color. In the bottle, it looks plain pink. I put it on my nails and it had a nice interesting pink, but I still don&#x27;t think it has as much multicolor, as the picture.  Until this moment, I was sure that I received the correct nail polish that looks different than the picture.</li>
    <li> Super thick Polish,  takes a long time dry. Not my cup of tea.</li>
    <li> Globy awful crap. this is NOT good nail polish :(</li>
    <li> I love this polish so much. it doesn&#x27;t chip or peel off for a long time, it makes my pedicures last so much longer and look so much better. It looks pretty on any color (right now i have it on an orangey pink-sounds weird but looks great-- last i had it on light blue). It&#x27;s iridescent and sparkles so much with different sized round &amp; hexagonal glitters. smell is kinda strong if you care about that sort of thing but goes away immediately (i personally don&#x27;t mind it at all).</li>
    <li> Okay.. This is a little more orange than anything AND it comes off super easy. I took a shower the same day I put it on &amp; it had peeled off 8 fingers. It&#x27;s pretty, but not THAT great.</li>
    <li> The product was here on time and exactly as promised!</li>
    <li> Great price n great product nice n thick so the glitter actually goes on ur nail with 1 - 2 coats !!!! N it arrived in  3  days</li>
    <li> love the color. takes a long time to dry through</li>
    <li> I love the way this looks, but it took FOREVER to solidify and stayed soft for hours. Still great though</li>
    <li> Wonderful color, glitter, and shine! I really can&#x27;t wait to send it to my friend! I think she will really love it because she collects nail polish.</li>
    <li> This Is Such A Great Polish &amp; I Love It..The Polish Sparkles &amp; Shines On My Nails &amp; I Am Very Happy With This Product.......Thanks</li>
    <li> This nail Polish was a bit pricey. I could&#x27;ve purchased something very similar at Walmart, Walgreens, or beauty supply store. It was a Christmas gift for my daughter. She enjoys painting her nails.</li>
    <li> Looks adorable pink and iridescent in the bottle, slap this on over a pitch black, and BLAM it&#x27;s like a crazy colorshift rainbow.  If you like intense color shift effects and a unique, eye catching look, this is great!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous polish, but not quite as pink as the picture suggests</li>
    <li> a party on your nails</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure where it comes from but I don&#x27;t think it is 3-free because it is the worst smelling polish I have ever come across. Like burn your nose hair strong. Only while its wet tho.</li>
    <li> Definitely a layering polish. Looks great over teal. Fairly thick, average polish smell. I can&#x27;t wait to try it with a lavender or baby pink.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my polish. It came super fast &amp; was exactly as described. It looks great over many different colors.</li>
</ol>
