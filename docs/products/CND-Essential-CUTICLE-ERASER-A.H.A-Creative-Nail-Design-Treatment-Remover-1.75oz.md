    <li> This is not a cuticle remover, but a conditioner. I get terribly jagged, torn skin below my cuticles and my cuticles grow over my nails very quickly. When I use Cuticle Eraser 4-6 times a week, my cuticles stay moisturized and snag-free. My cuticles still grow over my nail some, but not nearly as fast as without it. Cuticle Eraser has been a wonderful tool for keeping my cuticles in great shape.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and it is the best cuticle cream I have ever used.  My cuticles look great, they are so soft.  You only have to use a small amount so it lasts a long time.  Also, it has a very nice scent.</li>

    <li> I have rough cuticles.  I moisturize a lot but still had thick, dry cuticles.  After using this a few times a day for a week, my cuticles decreased in size by about half.  I still have very dry cuticles, but they&#x27;re much smaller.  It does work.  You&#x27;ll still need to moisturize though!</li>

    <li> I went to a spa for a manicure and pedicure and they were using this product.  I purchased it for myself and I love it.  I use it when I take a bath and have my and soaking.
