      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s amazing</li>
      <li>I got these at a mass retailer, but I was thrilled to see they&#x27;re being made again.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own</li>

      <li>I LOVE them</li>
      <li>I should have known better</li>
      <li>These look way more polished and hold up better than claw style clips.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>They were much better than a scrunch to pony tail and easier to put in and take out.</li>
      <li>Love these clips.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ll probably get some more in case</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase.</li>
      <li>But I made absolutely sure that the box had not been tampered with in any way.</li>
      <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE Twist and Clip</li>
      <li>If the stem part was maybe curved like the clasp part, it may have been ok.</li>
      <li>I was delighted with the spin pins I bought, but wish I&#x27;d found this first.</li>
      <li>Work much better and way more comfortable than a claw clip.  </li>
      <li>OK well, they work fine</li>
      <li>Sure it&#x27;s just a cheap hunk of bendable plastic, but it does what it says.</li>
      <li>it is really easy and most important to me</li>
      <li>This is easy to use and it locks my hair into place all day.</li>
      <li>My hair is curly, fine</li>
      <li>If your not wearing this around children, it works fine.</li>
      <li>I have shoulder length, stick straight-very fine hair.</li>
      <li>It does not work for fine hair.</li>
      <li>is it stays in and holds my hair securely.</li>
      <li>My hair stays up all day and feels secure.</li>
      <li>What a great way to hold up my hair in an instant.</li>
      <li>They keep my hair securely off of my neck in a twist in the summer.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfortable too.</li>
      <li>I will cheerfully be your tester, because these things work well.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>These clips keep my hair secure like nothing else.  </li>
      <li>I only wish the set came with more clips in a set and colors would be good too.</li>
      <li>Easy, quick, and holds even fine hair securely.</li>
      <li>and so quick and easy to uze</li>
      <li>, but I&#x27;d make sure you can see what you&#x27;re buying first with this one.</li>
      <li>I bought it for a special occasion and could not use it.</li>
      <li>I have straight fine hair for reference.</li>
      <li>The ones I ordered in June of this year are wonderful, but these are a complete waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Worth a shot for you</li>
      <li>Old Faithful ponytail is flattened out and hair flows more like a waterfall than a fire hose.</li>
      <li>I tried this product because I like to wear my hair up but needed a way to do this for work in a way which was more professional than a pony tail.  </li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite hair clip.  </li>
      <li>The clip slid right out of my hair.  </li>
      <li>The small one is good for using a portion of the hair, and the large one is good for pulling back all of your hair.  </li>
      <li>I had a mild headache today and never even reached to let my hair down, so it&#x27;s definitely more comfortable than rubber bands or scrunchies.</li>
      <li>They look exactly like the crappy plastic things that they hang socks on in stores...</li>
      <li>, the more stick is left over, So don&#x27;t poke out your BF&#x27;s eye.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>A bit tricky to use at first</li>
      <li>First of all...don&#x27;t leave these laying around the house.</li>
      <li>Great for long or short hair.  </li>
      <li>so someone really might throw them away if you leave them lying around!</li>
      <li>have a lot of very fine long hair.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve loved it so much i&#x27;ve ordered multiple packs, and when i lost my last one in the ocean (because i had it hooked to my bathing suit)</li>
      <li>I have fine hair which I color blond, which is cut in a bob to just above my shoulders.  </li>
      <li>I love all the different things you can do with them and how easy it is to put your hair in a simple classy twist.</li>
      <li>It really does what it says it does</li>
      <li>I was able to get it into place after about 3 or 4 tries.  </li>
      <li>I got some from my granddaughter at her garage sale and ended up liking them so much</li>
      <li>; web site are sturdier and hold very well.</li>
      <li>wish the straight stick part was shorter</li>
      <li>- it sticks out so much and doesn&#x27;t look very good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>this thing really holds your hair up and wont slide and fall out.</li>
      <li>I really like these.</li>
      <li>really need an XL size, Twisty-makers.</li>
      <li>I think I have too much hair.</li>
      <li>There are 4 to a box (2 regular size, 2 jumbo) and a bonus charm (cheap looking).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I actually really like this product.</li>
      <li>These Twist n Clips absolutely do the job, and</li>
      <li>but if your hair is thick you might not be able to fit all of it in one clip.</li>
      <li>They are so comfortable, don&#x27;t rip my hair out and stay in place for an amazingly long time.</li>
      <li>I have thinner hair now that I&#x27;m older</li>
      <li>I have such fine hair that very few hair materials stay, but this not only stays but is super comfortable too!</li>
      <li>But, I found that it doesn&#x27;t stay in place very well, I believe, due to my hair being fine and shoulder length.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend buying them.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;d probably work a lot better with a little piece of no-slip silicone/rubber like some pony tail holders ([[ASIN:</li>
      <li>I got 4 normal sized clips instead of 2 normal and 2 jumbo.</li>
      <li>have thick hair,the kind that will even break a metal clip.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The Twist n Clips sold on Amazon are flimsy and don&#x27;t hold anything.  The ones sold on the &amp;#34;As Seen on TV&amp;#34; web site are sturdier and hold very well.</li>
    <li> poor quality of material.</li>
    <li> Looked all over for this hair clip, it works very well on my long wavy hair. It holds my hair in place without pulling. I really like these.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how well these hold my hair up.  I got some from my granddaughter at her garage sale and ended up liking them so much I ordered more online.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s weird, but it works. it is really easy and most important to me is it stays in and holds my hair securely. Clips and claws always slowly slip out of my fine hair. It can also hold up my thick and heavy hair til I take it out. these are great</li>
    <li> I use twist n clip in my hair every day but this shipped product was awful. They are flimsy. I think maybe it was the end of production run and the quality personnel did Not catch it. They will Not stay in my hair. Will I order product again yes.</li>
    <li> First of all...don&#x27;t leave these laying around the house. They look exactly like the crappy plastic things that they hang socks on in stores...so someone will probably throw them away. You don&#x27;t want them thrown away, either, because they work.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair,the kind that will even break a metal clip. So far these have resisted my efforts to snap hair clips like a piece of spaghetti.&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the poster who didn&#x27;t like the \\&quot;stick\\&quot; part poking out so far. The \\&quot;loopy\\&quot; part wraps around the stick-part, and the thicker your hair, the more stick is left over, So don&#x27;t poke out your BF&#x27;s eye.&lt;br /&gt;I really need an XL size, Twisty-makers. I will cheerfully be your tester, because these things work well.&lt;br /&gt;You can get 2 small and 2 regular at stores for 10 bucks.</li>
    <li> I have thinner hair now that I&#x27;m older and it&#x27;s hard to find something to keep it up.....that stays in....well, this is great.....it STAYS....which is way better for me....I will give one to my Granddaughter with very thick hair as she has the same problem finding something to stay in.....I would buy this again</li>
    <li> This was a repurchase.  My hair is very long and this is my daily fix for it.  It takes me all on 15 seconds to have my hair done and up.  I keep losing them though and needed to rplenish my supply.  It really does what it says it does</li>
    <li> Will not hold my hair, was under the impression that it would.  Sadly mistaken. Not the same item I bought previously from a drug store.</li>
    <li> A couple of years ago I bought these at Wal- mart. I loved them!!! They were perfect and I could use them in all sorts of styles. They were much better than a scrunch to pony tail and easier to put in and take out. They also worked for the best up dos on the fly. Over time I had lost a couple and I wanted to replenish the supply. I ordered these expecting the same product I had. I  do not know if this is a copy cat brand or if they changed the way they  make them but they are extremely flimsy now and will not hold my hair at all. They constantly come undone before I can even get out the door.</li>
    <li> What a great way to hold up my hair in an instant. I have not-quite-shoulder-length hair and it&#x27;s either this or a pony tail. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great for long or short hair.  The small one is good for using a portion of the hair, and the large one is good for pulling back all of your hair.  Especially nice to use when you are between hair washes as it keeps those stray hairs in place.</li>
    <li> I bought this over a year ago and just ordered another package of them.  They don&#x27;t break, but my daughter took them home with her when she came to visit.  I have thick hair that is a little past my waist. These clips hold up all my hair all day.  I wear them to the pool for water aerobics and when riding on my motorcycle without a helmet.  They still stay in my hair and they are still as tight as when I put my hair up that morning.  I usually will put my hair up in a French Twist. I just need one clip to hold my hair up. I love this clips. I highly recommend buying them.</li>
    <li> Already had these and lost them. Held up my hair perfectly. I have a whole lot of very straight thin hair.</li>
    <li> Easy, quick, and holds even fine hair securely. Little pricey, but works. This is the second time I bought these (I tend to lose them around the house.)</li>
    <li> These are awesome. They are so comfortable, don&#x27;t rip my hair out and stay in place for an amazingly long time. I love all the different things you can do with them and how easy it is to put your hair in a simple classy twist. Work much better and way more comfortable than a claw clip.  I only wish the set came with more clips in a set and colors would be good too. I imagine they won&#x27;t last forever as they are made of plastic so I ordered another set so I won&#x27;t find myself without one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of very fine long hair. The clip holds all my hair up but if your hair is thick you might not be able to fit all of it in one clip.</li>
    <li> Terrible! Broke as we attempted to use them. Don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect!  Easy to use...very very strong...holds thick hair all day without slipping...DOESNT DAMAGE HAIR LIKE RUBBER BANDS!!!  It&#x27;s different shape gives a different shape to old standards.  Old Faithful ponytail is flattened out and hair flows more like a waterfall than a fire hose. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE Twist and Clip and so will you!</li>
    <li> I think I have too much hair. It didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I don&#x27;t even know where they ended up.</li>
    <li> I bought a box of these at Bed Bath and Beyond for $7.99 ($9.99 - 20% coupon). There are 4 to a box (2 regular size, 2 jumbo) and a bonus charm (cheap looking).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, straight, somewhat medium (not thick, not fine) hair and these don&#x27;t work that great. It does clip the hair, but it won&#x27;t stay there for an extended period.  These clips are made of smooth plastic with no grip, so my hair just slides out after a little while. They&#x27;d probably work a lot better with a little piece of no-slip silicone/rubber like some pony tail holders ([[ASIN:B003DKU3CY Scunci No-slip Grip Evolution Jelly Ponytailers, 14-Count, Colors may vary]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the straight stick part was shorter - it sticks out so much and doesn&#x27;t look very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave them to my neighbor with thick curly hair and she loves them - they stay in all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like another reviewer said, when untwisted, these look exactly like the tiny little hanger that socks come on...so someone really might throw them away if you leave them lying around!</li>
    <li> this is the only product that can hold my thick hair AND I can sleep with them in! I LOVE them</li>
    <li> OK well, they work fine I guess.  My hair is on the thick side, but not crazy thick.  These won&#x27;t quite bend around my hair.  I have made it work for the messy bun, but I can&#x27;t get the other ways to use them to work.  The smaller ones are not going to work for me, but I can pass them along to others.  Worth a shot for you I guess.</li>
    <li> This clip is awesome. It keeps my hair up and in style as promised. A bit tricky to use at first but after a few tries I got it! My daughter has taken one from me so I guess it is &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I love it. Just bought my third pack! I have curly hair and nothing holds my hair up like this clip. It doesn&#x27;t look frumpy like all those other clips and doesn&#x27;t tear my hair out.</li>
    <li> Although this item did hold my thick hair in place, I found the stem too long and sharp. I couldn&#x27;t wear it around my grandchildren because I thought they may get poked in the eye. If the stem part was maybe curved like the clasp part, it may have been ok. If your not wearing this around children, it works fine.</li>
    <li> The clip slid right out of my hair.  I tried several different \\&quot;styles\\&quot; and it ALWAYS fell out of my hair.  I should have known better (since NOTHING works with my hair). I have shoulder length, stick straight-very fine hair. I ended up giving two of the clips to a co-worker who has THICK hair.</li>
    <li> I like these . You can make other chains to put on the back of them. I used them with my grandaughter</li>
    <li> I got 4 normal sized clips instead of 2 normal and 2 jumbo. I can&#x27;t manage to get the clip around all of my hair like I thought I would be able to, with the commercial and other reviews claiming it worked for thick hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair which I color blond, which is cut in a bob to just above my shoulders.  I tried this product because I like to wear my hair up but needed a way to do this for work in a way which was more professional than a pony tail.  I saw the product on a TV informercial and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, they give you three clips with a little crystal design thing that you can optionally use to hang off one of the clips.  In the package, they give you brief instructions about how to use this product.  You are supposed to gather your hair like in a pony taily and then twist the product around your hair and stretch the one end of this product to clip into the other end through your gathered hair.  They say that it can take a few times until you get it right.  I was able to get it into place after about 3 or 4 tries.  But, I found that it doesn&#x27;t stay in place very well, I believe, due to my hair being fine and shoulder length.  If you had thicker and longer hair, I imagine that this would work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up giving this to my sister who has long hair down to her back.  I don&#x27;t know if she used it yet - she hasn&#x27;t mentioned anything to me about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I should have returned it but gave it away instead.  I will not be ordered this again.</li>
    <li> I love this! I have such fine hair that very few hair materials stay, but this not only stays but is super comfortable too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a junkie when it comes to ways of putting my hair up. My hair is curly, fine and I have a lot of it. I bought a box of these at a drug store (I think for $10) and I don&#x27;t regret it. it&#x27;s amazing how easy it holds your hair and never moves!  It&#x27;s comfortable too. You can actually lean your head back without having an annoying lump in the way. I&#x27;ll probably get some more in case I lose the ones I have.</li>
    <li> I received this item and was very disappointed with it. It does not work for fine hair. I bought it for a special occasion and could not use it.</li>
    <li> I love these. ..this is my second order and I may get another as a backup. . I like that I can get my hair up without pins n clips which sometimes give me headache. ..and so quick and easy to uze</li>
    <li> They say that there are two jumbo clips and two regular, but only got four regular which do not work in my hair.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I actually really like this product. Sure it&#x27;s just a cheap hunk of bendable plastic, but it does what it says. My hair stays up all day and feels secure. It doesn&#x27;t pull on my scalp or rip my hair out in hunks. I have straight fine hair for reference. Clips usually slide right out of my hair. But these clips stay put. (I only use the jumbo ones, not sure how well the smaller ones work.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now... The reason this review is not 5 stars. It is not because of the product itself, but because I was shipped a used, beat up item, with missing parts. The box the clips came in was not sealed at all. It had clearly been opened before because the two &#x27;jumbo&#x27; clips this set was suppose to come with were missing, I got the useless crystal thing and two small clips. One bronze, one black. Everything was just thrown into the box and was not sealed in bags or anything. It was all laying jumbled together at the bottom. The styling guide was missing too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I set up a return through Amazon and went and bought the exact same product from Walgreens which was on sale for $9.99 at the time. So with tax it cost about what it does on here. But I made absolutely sure that the box had not been tampered with in any way. All in all a good product, but I&#x27;d make sure you can see what you&#x27;re buying first with this one.</li>
    <li> this thing really holds your hair up and wont slide and fall out. i use it while swimming, working out, sleeping and it is still mostly in place at the end. its also not uncomfortable like other clips. i&#x27;ve loved it so much i&#x27;ve ordered multiple packs, and when i lost my last one in the ocean (because i had it hooked to my bathing suit) i almost cried..</li>
    <li> Every time I grow my hair out I end up buying a kazillion gizmos to try to manage it. I was delighted with the spin pins I bought, but wish I&#x27;d found this first. Admittedly, a lot of what you can do with these you can do with barrettes if you have fine hair, but these flex so much more that you can use them on thicker hair, or on hair that&#x27;s been twisted and folded back up over the head. My hair is now several inches below my shoulder and if I let it air dry then - since it is neither curly nor straight on it&#x27;s own - it definitely needs to be up if I go out. These makes it super-easy to make a messy bun or messy updo (and probably neat ones - I just don&#x27;t like my hair pulled tight). I&#x27;m eager to pass the brown ones on to my niece who teaches 1st grade and had about 20 inches or so of hair to deal with every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing - actually two last things :(1) my hair has been up in one today for ... about 8 hours, hasn&#x27;t moved or loosened, and (2) it&#x27;s far less tight than even a scrunchie, which really matters to me since when I get migraines I get totally annoyed by anything that pulls my hair tight. I had a mild headache today and never even reached to let my hair down, so it&#x27;s definitely more comfortable than rubber bands or scrunchies.</li>
    <li> I have thick, mediium length hair and was skeptical that these clips would work. They were very easy to use and held my hair in place all day. I have also used them to make a ponytail instead of the usual bands. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> these are a must have for long hair. stay in place even while running. no more ponytail slide or tangle.</li>
    <li> It is poorly made, I think if I had even heavier hair there would be no way it would hold it up.</li>
    <li> Update 4/19/16: This is by far my favorite hair clip.  I have so much hair that I just throw out the smaller ones and keep the big ones.  I don&#x27;t care about the crystal hanger nonsense either.  These clips keep my hair secure like nothing else.  Usually I can just pull up my hair up into a twist, clip it in place, and not think about it for the rest of the day.  I got these at a mass retailer, but I was thrilled to see they&#x27;re being made again.  I had &amp;#34;Clever-Clips&amp;#34; for a couple of years but eventually lost them all.  These look way more polished and hold up better than claw style clips.  They keep my hair securely off of my neck in a twist in the summer.  I have tons of very fine, straight, slippery hair, and if I pull the twist tight enough the Twist n Clip will not fall out.  It takes some experimenting but if your hair is long enough it will work.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use and it locks my hair into place all day. I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love these clips. They are the only thing I can use that keep my hair up for work and do not damage it. They no longer sell them in Wal-Mart but I am so glad that I found them here.</li>
    <li> Edit 12/18/2013: Oh dear. These things have been sold out in every store I&#x27;ve checked, so my husband ordered them again from Amazon. what I received almost look like knock-offs. They look and feel nothing like the ones I ordered earlier this year. The only thing identical are the colors. The set was supposed to come with two jumbo and two small. Well, all four are the same size and all four are made of the same flimsy material. I just tried to use one, and my hair fell out immediately. The straight portion was too weak to stay in the curved portion, so my hair would not stay up using the clip. The ones I ordered in June of this year are wonderful, but these are a complete waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a set of clips, two jumbo and two regular. The regular will not go in, so I have to use the jumbo. My hair is not especially thick, but it is long and wavy, so I need the bigger size. I don&#x27;t envision ever using the regular clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clips hold my hair all day with very little shift downward. I can sleep in them, and they&#x27;re a godsend when driving. The old squeeze clips would hit my headrest, and I always felt like I was driving with my head tilted forward. I drive a big old Jeep, so the windows are always down, and I need something to wrangle my hair and keep it from flying around Medusa-style. These Twist n Clips absolutely do the job, and they don&#x27;t move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside is that the stabby part can poke others, so you need to be mindful when going for hugs or cuddles.</li>
