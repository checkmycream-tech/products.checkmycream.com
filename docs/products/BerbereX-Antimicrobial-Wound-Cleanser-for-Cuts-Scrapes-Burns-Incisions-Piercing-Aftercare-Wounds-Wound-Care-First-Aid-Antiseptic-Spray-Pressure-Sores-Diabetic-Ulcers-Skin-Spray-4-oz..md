      <li>and I truly believe that BerbereX was instrumental in the speed in which my arm healed and the minimal scarring I experienced.</li>

      <li>I feel so lucky to have found this product.  </li>
      <li>It now has a well deserved place in my First Aid kit!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>Not only is this product amazing at rapidly healing wounds</li>
      <li>As soon as I run out I’ll be buying from Amazon especially with the Prime available, gotta love the prime.</li>
      <li>( it dries very quickly) and then resume my normal moisturizing regimen.</li>
      <li>right after my surgery.</li>
      <li>Doctor said it healed very fast.</li>
      <li>I had to open up the top and try pouring out the contents on the wound I was using it for.  </li>
      <li>used it on my second degree burn, hield with no scars :-)</li>
      <li>By the end of day 2, the cut looked significantly better and finally starting to heal.</li>
      <li>We love this product and are purchasing it for several diabetic family members.</li>
      <li>and I will be purchasing more in the future!</li>
      <li>I now have several bottles and will order more for the extended family.</li>
      <li>I absolutely recommend it to everyone!</li>
      <li>I was on the fence at first thinking it was just like everything else that is already out in the stores</li>
      <li>Ran across berberex here and decided to leave my first amazon review.</li>
      <li>that is exactly what happened.</li>
      <li>This is absolutely must have in every household.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Used it as an after shave for about a week and razor burn disappeared, so I’ve being using as an aftershave ever since in addition after I bought the whole case of it</li>
      <li>I have used this product on myself for a very deep sliced finger, and it worked fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Stuff works very well when others did not.</li>
      <li>The wounds to her outer ankle were particularly deep and the doctors were having significant difficulty healing them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m dealing with hormonal acne in my middle 30&#x27;s and this stuff is helping tremendously.</li>
      <li>and one of the main problem is that the nozzle does not spray.  </li>
      <li>I use it for my whole family, including my 2 year old!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a product I highly recommend</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it worked and how painless it was on my 4 year old.</li>
      <li>The very first day improvement was evident and within a week and a half the wound was healed.</li>
      <li>also used it on my cat who was attacked by a large male feral cat.  </li>
      <li>A couple of months ago I experienced a bad burn over a large portion of my arm</li>
      <li>This is the best product for not only scratches and cuts but for bad rashes.</li>
      <li>Kept the wound clean and help it to heal faster, with less scaring.</li>
      <li>Any scratches, burns, cuts and such will be cured in a very short time thanks to the Berberex.</li>
      <li>My husband burnt his arm pretty badly and he immediately felt better after we applied Berberex and it healed in no time!</li>
      <li>There is barely a mark telling where the slice happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I was extremely surprised when the cut was practically healed the very next day.  </li>
      <li>3.5 inch scar is barely noticeable  </li>
      <li>so I cannot say for certain the effectiveness of this compared to the other products.</li>
      <li>I’ve being using it for anything from bug bites to knee scrapes and cuts, which with an active 9 year old son I have plenty of, and so far berberex didn’t disappoint.</li>
      <li>but within the next few days it got pretty infected.</li>

<li> The only thing I’m disappointed about</li>
<li> Disappointed with product - did not help heal diabetic ulcer on left foot.  </li>
<li> By the end of day 5, I had nothing but a barely visible line across my finger Instead of the nasty cut I had just a few days earlier.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> I had a complicated shoulder injury and and used BerbereX</li>
<li> but, boy was I wrong!</li>
<li> it is very difficult for me to do so.</li>
<li> She was bitten badly on a leg.  </li>
<li> My wife was buying this at her beauty salon to help skin heal after dermabrasion procedures, so I figured I’d give it a try for my bad case of razor burn.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Although I have not used this product on a burn, it seems to work well on promoting healing on my face. However, I am using several other products as well so I cannot say for certain the effectiveness of this compared to the other products. I have gone through about one bottle so fas and will purchase again though.</li>
    <li> BerbereX was recommended to me by a friend who used the product and was very happy how fast it helped his wound heal after the surgery.  So, I ordered it just in case. First time I used it on a pretty good knife cut in the kitchen. I was extremely surprised when the cut was practically healed the very next day.  Now if I cut myself or get a burn, I use BerbereX. It now has a well deserved place in my First Aid kit! In my opinion, it is a great product to have just in case!!!</li>
    <li> Not only is this product amazing at rapidly healing wounds (I had an open wound on my stomach) and disinfecting them, it also did wonders for my skin. It cleared up acne spots and brightened my skin. Overall amazing product!</li>
    <li> We used this on son&#x27;s shoulder after surgery.  Kept the wound clean and help it to heal faster, with less scaring.</li>
    <li> Another good cleaner for my abscess</li>
    <li> The sprayer does not work well. The product could be great. I got it to clean wound after hand surgery. The sprayer is getting clogged or something. I have tried to flush the sprayer a few times but since my surgery was on my hand it is very difficult for me to do so.</li>
    <li> This product is terrific!  A couple of months ago I experienced a bad burn over a large portion of my arm and I truly believe that BerbereX was instrumental in the speed in which my arm healed and the minimal scarring I experienced. It did not irritate or burn when sprayed on and actually soothed the uncomfortableness.  I&#x27;ve also since used for minor cuts and scrapes and find it works well.  I feel so lucky to have found this product.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Stuff works very well when others did not. Had aburn that had a hard time healing and this did the job.</li>
    <li> Seems to accelerate healing according to parents of my grandchild.</li>
    <li> I had an iron burn. Applied this product on the 2nd day. It was not a fast healing as I expected. In about 5 days the burn started to heal, finally!</li>
    <li> This is the best product for not only scratches and cuts but for bad rashes. I had a rash that was inflamed and in a crease &amp; would not go away. 3 days of using this and it is much, much better. Also have a new puppy in the house who has those sharp little teeth. This is stopping the bleeding quickly and allowing the area to heal.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a while on all scrapes and cuts. Recently got a bad sun burn while on vocation and only had a bottle of Berberex in first aid kit. The following day, I was tan with no signs of being burnt. It has been two weeks now, and the skin is not even peeling. Went to their website, and I was amazed at what this product can do.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be less than advertised.  and one of the main problem is that the nozzle does not spray.  I had to open up the top and try pouring out the contents on the wound I was using it for.  Did seem to matter if I sprayed it or soaked it, did not help.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t post reviews on things that I purchase but this product is AWESOME! I was on the fence at first thinking it was just like everything else that is already out in the stores but, boy was I wrong! I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it worked and how painless it was on my 4 year old. I now have several bottles and will order more for the extended family. If you have little ones in your house, then  you know they constantly fall or hurt themselves. This spray is a MUST!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I suffer from skin rashes all the time. My friend told me about this product and I was skeptical that it can hepl me, due to label it was more targeted to use after burns, but in two days my skin looked much better and in about a week rash was gone. It really works!!!! If you have skin problems this product can solve it all.</li>
    <li> Excellent wound healer. Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I had foot blisters for two weeks that would not heal.  I applied BerbereX one night and by the next morning the healing was visible.  Within just a few days they were completely gone.  We love this product and are purchasing it for several diabetic family members.</li>
    <li> I am on the bottle #7 I think. This is absolutely must have in every household. Any scratches, burns, cuts and such will be cured in a very short time thanks to the Berberex. And since you don&#x27;t spend a lot of it while using it, it does last. We never go to the beach without it, nobody had any sunburns since we started using it. Everyone in our family - my husband, myself, 4 kids and 2 dogs - have a bottle on hands.</li>
    <li> use all the time for me and grand kids</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this for wound care, but rather for acne issues. I&#x27;m dealing with hormonal acne in my middle 30&#x27;s and this stuff is helping tremendously. I wasn&#x27;t expecting results in less than 24 hours but that is exactly what happened. That inflamed, red, sore, itchy, achy feeling that acne gives you can be relieved with BerbereX. I spray it on the trouble area, allow it to sink in my skin ( it dries very quickly) and then resume my normal moisturizing regimen. By the third day, not only was a problem area on my face cleared up, but sun spots on that side of my face were dramatically reduced. It has also helped with the tone and texture of my skin...even reduced a laugh line on my cheek! Now my teenage son who is dealing with onset acne is using it and it is also helping him. A little spray goes a long way and I can tell the bottle is going to last me a while, making the price justifiable. It&#x27;s a product I highly recommend and I will be purchasing more in the future!</li>
    <li> I burned my arm taking something out of the oven two month ago, used this product almost immediately and for two days was red and looks like a burn it hasn&#x27;t hurt at all or blistered at any point. In one week redness went away and skin started to look like nothing happened. Love this product. No scar or any skin defect at all.</li>
    <li> Healed a cut in two days. Also healed a burn</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I use it for my whole family, including my 2 year old! It treats any skin cuts, burns, rashes (including diaper rash) and the effect is almost immediate. My husband burnt his arm pretty badly and he immediately felt better after we applied Berberex and it healed in no time! I absolutely recommend it to everyone! Amazing product!</li>
    <li> Disappointed with product - did not help heal diabetic ulcer on left foot.  Spray attachment stopped working after 3 spray attempts.  Had to open bottle and pour liquid on gauze pad.  This used excessive product.  Too late to return</li>
    <li> amazing product, we have added it to all of our first aid kits at offices and in the field....</li>
    <li> Ran across berberex here and decided to leave my first amazon review. My wife was buying this at her beauty salon to help skin heal after dermabrasion procedures, so I figured I’d give it a try for my bad case of razor burn. Used it as an after shave for about a week and razor burn disappeared, so I’ve being using as an aftershave ever since in addition after I bought the whole case of it I’ve being using it for anything from bug bites to knee scrapes and cuts, which with an active 9 year old son I have plenty of, and so far berberex didn’t disappoint. The only thing I’m disappointed about is that I didn’t find it on amazon earlier, the price is a lot better than in beauty salon. As soon as I run out I’ll be buying from Amazon especially with the Prime available, gotta love the prime.</li>
    <li> Got a pretty nasty cut on my finger by one of my dogs about 2 months ago. I immediately cleaned the wound and put neosporin on it but within the next few days it got pretty infected. I got nervous so I went to the doctor and got a dose of antibiotics.  While at the doctor&#x27;s, I ran into a friend of mine who swore by BerbereX and how wonderful it was. I figured I&#x27;d try it... I decided to hold off on the antibiotics and try BerbereX. At first, it looked like I was going to have a pretty ugly scar on my finger from the cut.&lt;br /&gt;I used BerbereX twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. By the end of day 2, the cut looked significantly better and finally starting to heal. By the end of day 5, I had nothing but a barely visible line across my finger Instead of the nasty cut I had just a few days earlier.&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product on myself for a very deep sliced finger, and it worked fantastic.  There is barely a mark telling where the slice happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used it on my cat who was attacked by a large male feral cat.  She was bitten badly on a leg.  We used it to clean the wound, and after a few days of using the product, the leg is healing wonderfully, and she is able to walk, and jump normally again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product I would highly recommend, to be used on both humans and animals for injury !</li>
    <li> used it on my second degree burn, hield with no scars :-) definitely would recommend this product to anybody. Everybody my family has 1</li>
    <li> Using it on an elderly family member and can see improvement in her condition .</li>
    <li> Amazing Product. I had a complicated shoulder injury and and used BerbereX right after my surgery. Doctor said it healed very fast. 3.5 inch scar is barely noticeable  and it is only after few weeks of using it. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I have been a Registered Nurse for 25 years. One of my daughters is a competitive figure skater. She was unfortunately involved in a golf cart accident which caused her to have significant road rash and abrasions. The wounds to her outer ankle were particularly deep and the doctors were having significant difficulty healing them. She had been on antibiotics, ointments and burn creams for over a month with minimal results. A friend of mine suggested we try the BerbereX. The very first day improvement was evident and within a week and a half the wound was healed. So healed she could put her figure skating boot on again and get back on the ice without the wound reopening! A very impressive product! I am hoping to see it in the hospitals ASAP!</li>
