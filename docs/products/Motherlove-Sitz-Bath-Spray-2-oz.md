      <li>It&#x27;s so much better than the dermoplast spray they gave me.</li>

      <li>The spray is great because it can be applied as often as needed and is easier than taking several baths.</li>

      <li>I loved using this spray after the birth of my 3rd baby.</li>
      <li>I super loved this product when I was initially using it in the hospital after giving birth.  </li>
      <li>Instantly cooled and soothed the burning and irritation and next day saw a great improvement!</li>
      <li>And if you&#x27;re pregnant</li>
      <li>This spray not only helps you feel better, it truly helps you heal faster!</li>
      <li>Motherlove&#x27;s sitz spray feels AMAZING when sprayed on your tender parts the days following a birth.</li>
      <li>and then the fun is over.</li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s all natural and the company is here in the U.S.</li>
      <li>honestly can&#x27;t recommend this enough!</li>
      <li>I love that is has natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth it though.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s organic, made in USA, and worth the money.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
      <li>this would get 5 stars if I can spray it upright towards the right place</li>
      <li>And even better it&#x27;s quick and simple, just spray after you use the restroom.</li>
      <li>No mess, doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room, and smells fresh and clean (in an herbal way).</li>
      <li>I wish I&#x27;d had it for my first two births as well.</li>
      <li>I could not give a higher recommendation.</li>
      <li>which is sometimes necessary to get the angle you need&lt;br /&gt;Not as cleansing as a peri-wash, more designed to soothe</li>
      <li>(*ahem*) steamy in the bedroom.</li>
      <li>: I am now nearing the birth of my fourth, and still love this product.</li>
      <li>Healed well (episiotomy on first birth).</li>
      <li>I found it to be quite useful in helping to relieve the soreness and swelling thanks to the witch hazel.</li>
      <li>This product got me through the first 4 days post delivery.</li>
      <li>Immediately I felt the herbs working to soothe certain areas upon my first use of the product.</li>
      <li>ad really does the job with relieving soreness.  </li>
      <li>Really worked</li>
      <li>Did not do much for me.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>and I always have this spray ready to go.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for healing almost anything in the nether regions, especially if it involves tears or raw skin.</li>
      <li>I now buy this for every new mom!</li>
      <li>more than enough product for an un-complicated V. delivery with some stitches (2nd degree</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Works better than other alternatives and it is all natural which are all bonuses and scores highly in my book.</li>
      <li>This was a life saver product as I was in too much pain to prepare a sitz bath for myself AND too busy with a newborn to sit in it for the 15-25mins needed.</li>
      <li>It is also effective and soothing for small hemorrhoids and tears in or near the rectal area after birth as well.  </li>
      <li>Tip, spry rigt side up first to get the liquid in the pump then spray upsides down, it&#x27;s easier when the bottle is full.</li>
      <li>Send as a gift to new moms, but before they deliver.</li>
      <li>It is very soothing after having a baby (who knew?); so cleansing and fast acting.</li>
      <li>One bottle was enough for me but after returning from the hospital I first used up my dermoplast (?) numbing spray and then moved onto this.</li>
      <li>This product was such a life saver after I had my first son.  </li>
      <li>Other great things: a little goes a long way</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re planning a natural birth, BUY THIS.</li>
      <li>(if you find that product, let me know), but is very soothing almost instantly when applied.  </li>
      <li>This was much easier to use than the tuck&#x27;s pads, which I only used one or two of.  </li>
      <li>tear)- used the spray for about 3-4 wks&lt;br /&gt;Great to spray directly onto pad</li>
      <li>I found out that it actually is good for pregnancy hemorrhoids, and even for sore or raw skin in the nether regions after things get a little too</li>
      <li>Only negative would be that the spray bottle doesn&#x27;t always work great upside down.</li>
      <li>A total must-have for new mothers!</li>
      <li>I just wish it sprayed upside down a little better.</li>
      <li>It helped heal up a toddler&#x27;s vaginal infection from accidentally wiping the wrong way in 24 hours (along with one warm salt bath).</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a slight cooling sensation when you first apply it</li>
      <li>I just had my first baby less than 2 weeks ago &amp; have been using this since coming home from the hospital.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used this spray for postpartum after my second child. I found it to be quite useful in helping to relieve the soreness and swelling thanks to the witch hazel. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> This spray not only helps you feel better, it truly helps you heal faster! I could not give a higher recommendation. Other great things: a little goes a long way so I have plenty left for the next go-round, and it is also great for those nasty pregnancy and postpartum Hemorrhoids!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful for the sore areas after birth.  It is also effective and soothing for small hemorrhoids and tears in or near the rectal area after birth as well.  It has witch hazel (main ingredient in Tucks pads) in it as well, so it&#x27;s nice and easy to just spray wherever you need it and go.  It also smells lovely!  It&#x27;s not a cure all, nor is it going to make you feel 100% better (if you find that product, let me know), but is very soothing almost instantly when applied.  It&#x27;s organic, made in USA, and worth the money.</li>
    <li> this was a life saver after giving birth! either sprayed onto me, or onto a pad and then worn. The only con is that it doesnt spray a lot when upside down, so you have to spray a few times rightside up to load it, if that makes any sense. still completely worth it, and those extra sprays wont be wasted if you spray onto the pad. i still have some left in the bottle and i dont need it anymore</li>
    <li> Essential for postpartum soothing and healing! I give a bottle to all my expecting friends. Only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t spray upside down so you have to hold it a bit awkwardly. Definitely worth it though. Who has the time and energy to soak in a bath everyday with a new baby (as needed with the sitz powder)?</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Was the only thing that provided relief after the birth of my son. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Used it for 2 births and it&#x27;s fantastic. Healed well (episiotomy on first birth). Also the spray is just so much more convenient as you can spray it on the affected areas after using warm water to clean using a peri bottle. Spray on after every time you change pads and &amp;#34;go&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Must have for postpartum healing. The spray is great because it can be applied as often as needed and is easier than taking several baths. Love that it&#x27;s all natural and the company is here in the U.S. My only complaint, is the bottle could be a little easier for use, you can&#x27;t apply it while standing up.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re planning a natural birth, BUY THIS. Then buy it again. One bottle was enough for me but after returning from the hospital I first used up my dermoplast (?) numbing spray and then moved onto this. Both times I regretted not using it right away - it helps heal, not just numb you.  I love love loved it.</li>
    <li> this would get 5 stars if I can spray it upright towards the right place</li>
    <li> Thank god I found this product!! Was struggling with postpartum pain from tearing down there. This was a life saver product as I was in too much pain to prepare a sitz bath for myself AND too busy with a newborn to sit in it for the 15-25mins needed. Spayed this on my area and it helped with not only the pain but also the healing process! Great ingredients</li>
    <li> Did not do much for me.</li>
    <li> This product was such a life saver after I had my first son.  I was having trouble healing but once I used this product, everything improved.  I now buy this for every new mom!</li>
    <li> This spray relieves soreness without irritating your woman parts. The 2 oz. bottle also goes a long way. My baby is almost 7 weeks and I still haven&#x27;t even reached the half-way point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spray a little on after each shower, or even pour a very small amount into a tub of warm water and you feel relief from any soreness you may experience after childbirth.</li>
    <li> I think if I put some mouthwash in a spray bottle and spritzed it on my ass it would have the same affect. There&#x27;s a slight cooling sensation when you first apply it and then the fun is over. it cures nothing.&lt;br /&gt;boo hoo.&lt;br /&gt;sincerely, my bum.</li>
    <li> So easy to use after a bath or shower. Smells nice, seems to work well.</li>
    <li> I Was researching sitz baths and came upon this. I was desperate so ran (waddled) thru target grabbing what I could. Prep h is awful. Only made burning worse. Witch hazel was Soothing. Tried this out next and omg it was great! Instantly cooled and soothed the burning and irritation and next day saw a great improvement! Def keeping this around!</li>
    <li> Loved it, it really works!  Noticed a difference with this birth vs 2 previous birth recoveries.  Give it a try, you&#x27;ll be happy you did!</li>
    <li> A lifesaver.  If you&#x27;re debating, just get it.  I used this every trip to the bathroom in the first few weeks and healed much quicker than previous delivery without it.  The only note I would have is that the spritzer nozzle would stick and had to be manually pulled up again so as to &amp;#34;recharge&amp;#34; for another spritz.</li>
    <li> I just had my first baby less than 2 weeks ago &amp; have been using this since coming home from the hospital. It&#x27;s so much better than the dermoplast spray they gave me. It smells great &amp; soothes the area. Only minor complaint, it doesn&#x27;t spray upside down. So for the first week I was wasting 2 sprays just to get it going again when I realized I just need to awkwardly spray it with my thumb right side up.</li>
    <li> I super loved this product when I was initially using it in the hospital after giving birth.  There is something soothing, healing, and refreshing about it-- I recommend it for that hosptial bag!</li>
    <li> Very soothing, helped a great deal in the weeks after giving birth! I tore, and had stitches to heal, and this spray worked great when I didn&#x27;t have time to do a sitz bath.</li>
    <li> horrible, gave my wife an allergic reaction</li>
    <li> Send as a gift to new moms, but before they deliver. I love this product!  It is very soothing after having a baby (who knew?); so cleansing and fast acting. Also can use the leftover on baby for diaper changes or scrapes/cuts on bigger kids. Awesome stuff.</li>
    <li> I loved using this spray after the birth of my 3rd baby. It provides relief and smells great. I love that is has natural ingredients. I&#x27;ve even bought a few of these to give at baby showers.</li>
    <li> This review is for the Motherlove Sitz Bath Spray in a 2oz bottle. Not for the loose herb sitz bath supplies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this for the birth of my third child, and it is the absolute BEST product I&#x27;ve ever used for healing birth tears, scrapes, and soreness. After each birth I&#x27;ve been given assorted sitz bath products...mostly loose herbs or diluted witch hazel. I got so sick of the mess that I purchased Motherlove Sitz Bath Spray on a whim with my normal home birth supplies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh my goodness. This is so easy. No mess, doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room, and smells fresh and clean (in an herbal way). I used it instead of soaked witch hazel pads or herbal baths. Just spray a little on and viola! Good to go. My third baby is now over a year old, but I still use this same bottle once in a while. It&#x27;s great for healing almost anything in the nether regions, especially if it involves tears or raw skin. I used it on a baby&#x27;s bad diaper rash, and it worked as well as Badger Baby Balm, which is my favorite baby product. It helped heal up a toddler&#x27;s vaginal infection from accidentally wiping the wrong way in 24 hours (along with one warm salt bath). I also imagine that it would be great for pregnancy hemorrhoids, but haven&#x27;t had a chance to test out that theory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly can&#x27;t recommend this enough! I wish I&#x27;d had it for my first two births as well. When this runs out I&#x27;m getting another, even if I&#x27;m not pregnant again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 5/2013: I am now nearing the birth of my fourth, and still love this product. I found out that it actually is good for pregnancy hemorrhoids, and even for sore or raw skin in the nether regions after things get a little too (*ahem*) steamy in the bedroom. With three small kids already, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;ll have time for herbal baths, or even little sitz baths after this baby arrives. I need quick, easy, and effective, and that&#x27;s exactly what the Sitz Bath Spray provides.</li>
    <li> This spray is amazing. Delivered vaginally with minor tearing. Used this every time I went to the bathroom in addition to Dermoplast spray and Vicks pads. The combination worked perfectly. The spray delivered immediate relief and the scent is mild but very pleasant. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is literally my after birth crack. Motherlove&#x27;s sitz spray feels AMAZING when sprayed on your tender parts the days following a birth. I have birthed four children, three being homebirths and I always have this spray ready to go. You need this!!!</li>
    <li> worked almost immediately.</li>
    <li> This spray is supposed to go on your nether regions, yet the bottle doesn&#x27;t spray upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a serious design flaw which has me wanting to throw away the whole thing in disgust :(</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;All natural&lt;br /&gt;soothing&lt;br /&gt;pleasant scent&lt;br /&gt;easier than sitz squirter which has to be mixed/filled each time&lt;br /&gt;portable&lt;br /&gt;way more than enough product for an un-complicated V. delivery with some stitches (2nd degree tear)- used the spray for about 3-4 wks&lt;br /&gt;Great to spray directly onto pad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t spray as well when held upside down- which is sometimes necessary to get the angle you need&lt;br /&gt;Not as cleansing as a peri-wash, more designed to soothe/refresh</li>
    <li> This product got me through the first 4 days post delivery. I used it with every sitz bath and every bathroom use. It is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Great product for postpartum care.</li>
    <li> This was a blessing after I gave birth to my baby! I suggest buying 2-3 to get you through those first few weeks after delivery. I got instant pain relief! And even better it&#x27;s quick and simple, just spray after you use the restroom. I also suggest ice. Only negative would be that the spray bottle doesn&#x27;t always work great upside down. Tip, spry rigt side up first to get the liquid in the pump then spray upsides down, it&#x27;s easier when the bottle is full.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use for post delivery. Immediately I felt the herbs working to soothe certain areas upon my first use of the product. Smells great as well not leaving you with an medicine type smell or strong odor upon applying. I would definitely recommend this product to other expectant moms. I also wish I had it before going into labor to use immediately after delivery. This and the balm works wonders. You will not be disappointed. Works better than other alternatives and it is all natural which are all bonuses and scores highly in my book.</li>
    <li> Great helped with healing and loved the fresh herbal smell. Will get all my pregnant friends for shower gift! Really worked</li>
    <li> Oh god, this was a lifesaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend who has recently given birth, and she cannot stop raving about how &amp;#34;wonderful and life saving&amp;#34; this stuff is.</li>
    <li> After having a second degree tear from giving birth to my son, this stuff made me feel human down there ad really does the job with relieving soreness.  Great to have if you don&#x27;t have the time nor patience for Sitz baths. Ladies, this is definitely a must have for your hospital bag and postpartum gear!</li>
    <li> A total must-have for new mothers! So soothing on sore lady parts! I just wish it sprayed upside down a little better.</li>
    <li> This was much easier to use than the tuck&#x27;s pads, which I only used one or two of.  These have been a huge help with comfort and healing.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Used it for postpartum perineal healing. I did not do any actual sitz baths but, I healed (4 tears) beautifully without complications. (I also used Whitch Hazel and Arnica) I recommend this to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;I did not have a problem spraying it on, just don&#x27;t hold it upside down (gravity doesn&#x27;t work that way). :P</li>
    <li> This was great after I had a 2nd degree tear. I made padsicles with witch hazel and aloe vera but it felt humid down there so I used this instead!</li>
    <li> Enjoyed this product,&lt;br /&gt;Just wish it had an inverted sprayer since the bottle gets turned upside down to use</li>
    <li> Because it has alcohol  in it, I was afraid it would burn tender tissue in perianal area but is soothing and healing upon application. It also helps heal hemorrhoids.  It&#x27;s worth the price.  Application by spray is awkward but you can spray wipes  or Tucks &amp; apply.</li>
    <li> It has a slight cooling effect and did help to some degree in healing.  I&#x27;m not as impressed with this as I was with the earth mama bottom balm though.</li>
    <li> If you were sliced down there and you&#x27;re in a pain, get this product. I used it every time I went to the bathroom just to soothe myself. And if you&#x27;re pregnant I hope it isn&#x27;t necessary for you to be sliced or that you don&#x27;t rip when baby comes out.</li>
