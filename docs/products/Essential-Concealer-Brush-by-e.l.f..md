### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is great!</li>
      <li>Perfect brush for nail polish cleanup around the cuticle.</li>
      <li>This brush is a great value for the price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>But good care of the brush can prolong its lifetime.</li>
      <li>I use this concealer brush as a nail polish clean-up brush, and it does a good job for that purpose.</li>
      <li>Good brush for the price, does it job.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just the right size and stiffness to get perfect results!</li>
      <li>Think I&#x27;ll buy a couple more!</li>
      <li>I love it this item.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect, just like every other elf product I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
      <li>Like many others, I use this brush exclusively to clean up the cuticle area when I polish my nails.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for that purpose, only downside is that the bristles can&#x27;t handle acetone for more than a couple of months.</li>
      <li>Just dip in acetone, dap lightly on paper towel to remove excess, and sweep brush around the outline of your nail.</li>
      <li>Super easy to clean and use.</li>
      <li>That brush works the first time every time :)</li>
      <li>Excellent for nail polish cleanup but does not last more than 2 weeks with daily acetone use.</li>
      <li>I use this with acetone to clean up nail polish mistakes.</li>
      <li>And the price is right too!</li>
      <li>This is a good liner brush but personaly i think the brissles are too short to do concealer</li>
      <li>Luckily, walmart sells this brush for $1</li>
      <li>This brush allows you to cover exactly what you want covered.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I quite like this brush for the purposes of polish cleanup, but it&#x27;s not my absolute favorite for that usage (my favorite is the cheapy brush that comes with the Wet n&#x27; Wild $3 gel eyeliner.</li>
      <li>I love this brush because when I&#x27;m trying to cover a dark mark with some makeup, all I have to do it dab it on with this brush.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see why everyone keeps saying this was too small, I love it.</li>
      <li>Studio Makeup Lock &amp; Seal - 86011 Clear]].</li>
      <li>The bristles also taper inward to form a flat paddle shape, which means the bristles are uneven, making polish cleanup a bit more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The brush doesn&#x27;t last a very long time if used to clean up nail polish, but they are affordable enough that it doesn&#x27;t make a big difference.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little small for the under eye area if you need a lot of coverage, but it&#x27;s great for small details &amp; concealer around the brows &amp; mouth.</li>

    <li> This brush is a great value for the price. It&#x27;s a little small for the under eye area if you need a lot of coverage, but it&#x27;s great for small details &amp; concealer around the brows &amp; mouth. Holds up well to cleaning and disinfecting.</li>
    <li> I got this brush for cuticle clean-up after applying nail polish. It&#x27;s great for that purpose, only downside is that the bristles can&#x27;t handle acetone for more than a couple of months. But good care of the brush can prolong its lifetime.</li>
    <li> This is a good liner brush but personaly i think the brissles are too short to do concealer</li>
    <li> This brush is horrible because it&#x27;s tiny. I knew I&#x27;d be trying to make my face for hours using it, so I switched back to the brush that comes with this [[ASIN:B0069VEH1W e.l.f. Studio Makeup Lock &amp; Seal - 86011 Clear]]. That brush works the first time every time :) See the photos I uploaded.</li>
    <li> Excellent for nail polish cleanup but does not last more than 2 weeks with daily acetone use. Luckily, walmart sells this brush for $1</li>
    <li> It does exactly what I need it to do. I love it this item. It&#x27;s firm yet soft and my concealer glides on.</li>

    <li> I use this as a &amp;#34;clean up&amp;#34; brush for manicures!</li>
    <li> Good brush for the price, does it job. But maybe it is way too smal. I bought mine at my local target way cheaper!</li>
    <li> These are $1 at walmart. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Poor quality. Brush pushes down into stock and I have to keep pulling out.</li>
    <li> The brush was smaller than I expected. The bristles on the brush were too hard. I used this brush once and now it&#x27;s sitting in my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> I love this brush because when I&#x27;m trying to cover a dark mark with some makeup, all I have to do it dab it on with this brush. Sometimes there&#x27;s a few small dark marks I need to cover and my fingertips are too big to just cover the mark. This brush allows you to cover exactly what you want covered. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Brush works for its intended purpose, I just wish there was a cap of sorts for it. I have to keep it in the plastic it came in to avoid ruining it and a mess in my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> I use this with acetone to clean up nail polish mistakes. It&#x27;s just the right size and stiffness to get perfect results! And the price is right too! Think I&#x27;ll buy a couple more!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see why everyone keeps saying this was too small, I love it. It&#x27;s perfect, just like every other elf product I&#x27;ve purchased. It serves it&#x27;s purpose and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Perfect brush for nail polish cleanup around the cuticle. Just dip in acetone, dap lightly on paper towel to remove excess, and sweep brush around the outline of your nail. Perfection!</li>
    <li> Too small for what I need.</li>
