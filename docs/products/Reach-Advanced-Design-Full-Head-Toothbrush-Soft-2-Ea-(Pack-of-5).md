      <li>We have been users of Reach Toothbrushes for years and they work great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked the brand Reach,and these are no exception!  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a good deal.  </li>
      <li>The price was exceptional.</li>
      <li>GREAT PRICE AND QUICK SHIPPING!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s nice to buy in bulk for the year.</li>
      <li>This Reach toothbrush has a medium-sized head which is good for brushing all areas of the teeth, and the soft bristles are excellent for brushing along the gum line..</li>
      <li>These brushes are a nice size and are fine for about a month</li>
      <li>Totally delighted arriving home to find my purchase delivered and exactly what I hoped for!</li>
      <li>; When it comes to function, though, these are top of the line.</li>
      <li>Love these toothbrushes.  </li>
      <li>These are excellent solid toothbrushes!</li>
      <li>I ordered these specifically because the picture showed my favorite toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>And the price here is FANTASTIC!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted, at a good price.  </li>
      <li>I think I got a better value than I originally thought at purchase.</li>
      <li>This is the best toothbrush I have found, but it is not available in many stores.</li>
      <li>Perfectly fine toothbrush, but</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s free</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great price, and perfectly fine if you don&#x27;t have a small mouth and sensitive gums :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Please consider using Amazon &#x27;Smile&#x27; when buying from Amazon........</li>
      <li>highly effective brushes that disappeared from store shelves after the craze of racing strips, 17 bright colors, shock-absorbing zig-zag handles and other marketing fluff kicked in.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s only the 2 of us and occasional guests that will require a toothbrush, but since toothbrushes are not perishable we happily can store, then use these for months.</li>
      <li>One star for these toothbrushes is a very high rating.</li>
      <li>The handle is flat on both sides and has rubberized strips, making it easy to hold and maneuver.  </li>
      <li>I am very disappoint</li>
      <li>I ordered them, they arrived within a reasonable time.  </li>
      <li>Straight brush  </li>
      <li>The bristles are of different heights and clean the back area of the mouth easily.</li>
      <li>Last week when I place my order I asked that I be mailed the older style of the \\&quot;Advanced Design\\</li>
      <li>Besides their flat handle allows them to fit in a bathroom toothbrush holder where many other fatter handles will not.</li>
      <li>They are simple to look at, so I suppose they aren&#x27;t exciting eye candy promising a &amp;#34;wonderful experience!&amp;#34</li>
      <li>The price especially, for what all you get,is very reasonable!</li>
      <li>These toothbrushes are becoming more difficult to find, so having searched on Amazon and to my delight have found them, I had to order.</li>
      <li>A little firmer than most soft brushes...which I like.</li>
      <li>The stores I frequent seem to have stopped stocking this item so I stocked up!</li>
      <li>Seems funny to rave about them, but we love the size of the brush head, not to big or too small.</li>
      <li>And when I have had a cleaning I throw out my old brushes.</li>
      <li>Though &#x27;soft,&#x27; it&#x27;s rougher.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for the old Reach toothbrushes and the product that is pictured here</li>
      <li>Plus I love having a bunch of these brushes at hand, as it&#x27;s not easy finding them at my local stores.  </li>
      <li>This is clearly a better buy than purchasing individually at a brick and mortar store as we have in the past.</li>
      <li>Can you believe that the bottom 2-1/2&amp;#34; of the handle is so soft that it bends in your hand making it impossible to hold it comfortably in your hand while in use, your hand keeps sliding down, you can NEVER get a good grip.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They are much larger, the head is huge, and the bristles are rather stiff.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Perfectly fine toothbrush, but not what I thought they were.  I believed I was ordering the same toothbrush I get from my dentist, which I can&#x27;t find anywhere, but these ended up being totally different.  They are much larger, the head is huge, and the bristles are rather stiff.  It&#x27;s a great price, and perfectly fine if you don&#x27;t have a small mouth and sensitive gums :)</li>
    <li> These are excellent solid toothbrushes! The pack of 3 comes in blue, green, purple, or pink. The price is very good compared to what you would pay at the drugstore. As recommended by my periodontist I use 2 toothbrushes... 1 for the am and 1 for the pm so they dry out in between brushing. I also change m brushes after I&#x27;ve had a bad cold or the flu. And when I have had a cleaning I throw out my old brushes. So if you are changing your brushes a lot it&#x27;s nice to buy in bulk for the year.</li>
    <li> We have been users of Reach Toothbrushes for years and they work great. Besides their flat handle allows them to fit in a bathroom toothbrush holder where many other fatter handles will not.</li>
    <li> Good quality toothbrushes!!! I&#x27;ve always liked the brand Reach,and these are no exception!  The price especially, for what all you get,is very reasonable!</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite toothbrush and difficult to find locally.  It is convenient to buy these in bulk and have on hand as they are needed.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the old Reach toothbrushes and the product that is pictured here is what I was looking for!  Straight brush  design with a bristle tip on the end.  They are hard to find in the stores. However, the package I received contained the newer version; jagged brush design and no tip.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I ordered these specifically because the picture showed my favorite toothbrush.  I was sent the newer style, which I could have bought at any store nearby.  I did not like the new style and was very disappointed with the seller&#x27;s false advertising.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find my Reach toothbrushes at Target or CVS anymore.  Thank goodness for Amazon!.&lt;br /&gt;The description is off.  It says &#x27;2 Ea&#x27;.  It&#x27;s actually 3 like the picture.  I thought I was getting 10 and I got 15!  I think I got a better value than I originally thought at purchase.</li>
    <li> I like these toothbrushes.  I ordered them, they arrived within a reasonable time.  What else can I say?</li>
    <li> This Reach toothbrush has a medium-sized head which is good for brushing all areas of the teeth, and the soft bristles are excellent for brushing along the gum line.. The handle is flat on both sides and has rubberized strips, making it easy to hold and maneuver.  This is the best toothbrush I have found, but it is not available in many stores.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t you just hate it when the no frills item you&#x27;ve bought for so long disappears from the super market shelf?</li>
    <li> Last week when I place my order I asked that I be mailed the older style of the \\&quot;Advanced Design\\&quot; Reach Toothbrushes, specifically like the ones shown in this Amazon ad (the Reach toothbrushes with the white bristles surrounded by blue bristles). I was sent the newer version. I am very disappoint</li>
    <li> These brushes are a nice size and are fine for about a month and then the bristles begin to come out, usually getting stuck in your teeth.</li>
    <li> First let me say there is nothing wrong with the vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW.......This toothbrush is junk. One star for these toothbrushes is a very high rating. I am very disappointed in Reach. Can you believe that the bottom 2-1/2&amp;#34; of the handle is so soft that it bends in your hand making it impossible to hold it comfortably in your hand while in use, your hand keeps sliding down, you can NEVER get a good grip.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend buying these unless you want to decorate your garbage can with them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please consider using Amazon &#x27;Smile&#x27; when buying from Amazon........it&#x27;s free</li>
    <li> The total here is 10 individual toothbrushes for about twenty bucks.  That&#x27;s a good deal.  Plus, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find these in stores these days.</li>
    <li> Love these toothbrushes.  I wish the box stores would still sell them.</li>
    <li> Totally delighted arriving home to find my purchase delivered and exactly what I hoped for! The protective wrapping was impressive and very effective. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Plenty of bristles wider head.goof grip..works for me!!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is clearly a better buy than purchasing individually at a brick and mortar store as we have in the past. There&#x27;s only the 2 of us and occasional guests that will require a toothbrush, but since toothbrushes are not perishable we happily can store, then use these for months. We recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> The best toothbrush. Seems funny to rave about them, but we love the size of the brush head, not to big or too small. The bristles are of different heights and clean the back area of the mouth easily. These toothbrushes are becoming more difficult to find, so having searched on Amazon and to my delight have found them, I had to order. Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, at a good price.  The stores I frequent seem to have stopped stocking this item so I stocked up!</li>
    <li> Not the make I was used to brushing my teeth.  Though &#x27;soft,&#x27; it&#x27;s rougher.</li>
    <li> These are the serious. highly effective brushes that disappeared from store shelves after the craze of racing strips, 17 bright colors, shock-absorbing zig-zag handles and other marketing fluff kicked in. They are simple to look at, so I suppose they aren&#x27;t exciting eye candy promising a &amp;#34;wonderful experience!&amp;#34; When it comes to function, though, these are top of the line. I bought these in a bundle of 5x3 (5 packets, each containing 3 brushes). The price was exceptional. Though these will last me 15 months they don&#x27;t take up a lot of room at the back of the drawer, so it&#x27;s not like storing 15 months of shaving foam. I just wish we could start finding these on store shelves, again.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE AND QUICK SHIPPING!</li>
    <li> A little firmer than most soft brushes...which I like.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothbrush!  I have a tendency to brush too hard and wear away my gums, but this brush is soft enough so that I can&#x27;t do that.  Yet it cleans well because of its shape and size.  Plus I love having a bunch of these brushes at hand, as it&#x27;s not easy finding them at my local stores.  And the price here is FANTASTIC!</li>
