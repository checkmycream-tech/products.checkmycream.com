<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love love LOOVE these. They came about two weeks before the estimated ship date and are super easy to put on. My only problem is personal in that I have REALLY thick hair and these are a little bit too thin, but I ordered another so hopefully fix that :)</li>
    <li> the hair arrived way before the expected date, the colors are true to the photos, the hair is a full head the clips are stable, although these extensions are synthetic they are heat resistant. Over all very pleased</li>
    <li> This product is super amazing!! It came WAY before it was supposed to arrive!! The colors also looked exactly like the picture showed which was a big bonus. The extensions also came with a little sewing kit and extra clips in case some broke or fell off, a cute little black hair band, and a little note from the seller. I loved that they took the time to do that which to me shows they are the real deal and really care about their costumers. The extensions are also pretty long so they needed to be trimmed a little when i got them, but they still looked super great. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Product was great! A little heavy on my head but for the price was worth it!</li>
    <li> The hair strands fall out very easily</li>
    <li> Great extensions! Thick and long! Came in way before it was estimated to also! I recommend this product! Looks rad ;D</li>
    <li> I love these extensions. They were delivered very fast too. Might buy more in different colors.</li>
    <li> Its thick. And long. I love it</li>
    <li> Love the extensions! They are just as pictured, although a little thinner (so it may not hurt to order 2) but, if your just looking for something fun &amp; casual like me, then it&#x27;s perfect! Came with all 5 clips attached to the top of the hair, and was very long. Keep in mind you can trim this so I think that is what I will do to make it fit my hair better. It also arrived way quicker than the delivery date, which is never a bad thing! Over all, I love these extensions and they are a fun touch especially for the price! Would love to wear these for some added fun in the summer.</li>
    <li> I Love these clip ins C; base the color on the picture with the lady sitting down, they arrived WAAAYYYY earlier than expected, i gave these 4 stars out of 5 because they shed alittle when you take it out of the packets but, it&#x27;s not unbearable, if it bothers you, you can seal the wefts with fray chek (that what I did) It tangles but not unbearable, but what can you expect from synthetic hair. AMAZING QUALITY!!!!! this is better than my EpicCosplay wig. The ends are alittle thinner than the top because it&#x27;s ombre but its not too bad, i would still DEFINITELY recommend this C: I got 3 of them and they are REALLY thick (this is my honest review, I&#x27;m not being paid/forced to do this)</li>
    <li> Amazing! I love love love them, I had to trim them a bit cause they where super long but besides that there great! They don&#x27;t shed or anything! arrive a week early.</li>
    <li> The package came two weeks after I ordered it, which is way before the expected delivery date. The package also comes with two extra clips incase any of the 5 sewn in fall off. Needle &amp; some thread and a cute hair tie is also included, which is a nice touch. It blends so well with my black hair extensions. The hair extension itself is really soft and about 23 inches in length so thats pretty long! I will definitely order another pair soon!</li>
    <li> I am soooo please with the product I ordered. I am very satisfied with the quality of hair (thickness) and the length and the color is beautiful. Amazing hair extensions for the price, I have recommend to a few of my friends and will def be a returning costumer. Thank you for the amazing service.</li>
    <li> It seems to be real hair</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty heavy, my daughter wore it one time.</li>
    <li> Very nice color true to picture.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the hair extentions just like the picture and they work great.</li>
    <li> No complaints. Long fake extensions.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and long but it thins out a bit too much on the lighter part. I can&#x27;t really wear it because my hair is way to thin so u can really see the clips... Unless I wear a hat. It doesn&#x27;t curl very well either I tried everything braiding it and running a flat iron over it the night before worked nicely but not exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Ok but cheap fake hair</li>
    <li> First of all, it shipped the next day and arrived super fast!&lt;br /&gt;Texture wise, the hair falls off when bushing and tangles, but i like it. It really long too so i had to trim it. :)&lt;br /&gt;Overall. Good! because its cheap</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY ADORE IT! Came in wonderful time and ROCKS!!!! I would reccomend this hair peice to anyone &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> It goes great very cute some hair does fall out when you comb it The first time it goes great and it&#x27;s beautiful with my hair The color is amazing</li>
    <li> The darker blue is so much longer than the lighter. If you have to trim the bottom depending on your hair length it just looks stupid. It&#x27;s good for crazy hair, but not for looking good.</li>
    <li> I would give it a 5 star review but I see almost everyone else saying they got extra clips/a sewing kit, and a hair tie in their package and I got none of that. The hair is soft and silky, easy to brush, the clips are on sturdy, but the extra pieces others got would be nice.</li>
    <li> Yes it isn&#x27;t real human hair. But the extension is very thick and long and very soft. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely gorgeous. My only problem is that it is really heavy and the clips show through on occasion. If the clips dont show through, it can be bumpy if you dont know how to use is correctly. It is beautiful nonetheless.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in the middle of January and just received it today. But it was well worth the wait! Amazing quality! I got the blue to peacock green and it looks exactly like the picture. Feels like real hair and blends really well. I read other reviews saying it sheds a lot but when I brushed it out only one strand came out. Overall definitely worth it, especially $6</li>
    <li> Was sooooooo worth the wait and the money. Love this! GREAT QUALITY</li>
    <li> This is beautiful but it doesn&#x27;t work WELL with short hair. It also tangles easily but don&#x27;t get me wrong this is a great product and by all means worth buying.</li>
    <li> The color is beautiful just like in the picture and it comes with extra clips. Definitely worth buying!</li>
    <li> Nice and long&lt;br /&gt;Vibrant Color&lt;br /&gt;Easy to put on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that it isn&#x27;t as full as I thought it was</li>
    <li> Great quality product! I love it! The color is true to what the picture shows, great quality, doesn&#x27;t shed, firmly attached to the clips. Definitely worth buying! I would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I loved this hair so much, I had haidresser glue to my own (with hair glue of course) and used for extentions. Worked well, usually use very expensive hair, this just as good and love color. Really beautiful color and good quality hair, looks real for &amp;#34;blue hair&amp;#34;. I have used iron, on low heat to curl w/o any problems. But, use low heat! Also used ceramic iron, not sure if it matters. Then cut it, attached it, styled it and got perfect hairstyle, exactly what I wanted. Would work great typical way too, I&#x27;m sure, but was so impressed with quality, tried to use as extentions. Glad I did.</li>
    <li> I had a blast taking selfies after I got these (obviously)! These are amazing! They are so soft and have lace along the clips for a nice heavy durable product! I&#x27;m in love😍</li>
    <li> I am loving this hair! I will be ordering the other cloros. It is thicker than I thought it would be and perfect for that peekaboo look I was going for.</li>
    <li> LOVEEEE these extensions! About to go buy more! They are super sturdy and remain in your hair. The clips are great. I think it looks natural on my hair.</li>
    <li> love this hair piece it matches my hair nicely since its blue thanks</li>
    <li> My daughter loved the look of these, &amp; the color was true to the picture when they arrived. Her only complaint is that they can not be curled. She tried with her curling iron &amp; flat iron, but they would not hold the curl. She trimmed them to be the perfect length for her, &amp; has used them several times already. A plus being they are easy to put in &amp; take out of hair.</li>
    <li> The Hair came two weeks earlier than it was supposed to, it was nicely packaged, and the hair soft. There were several clips on the weft for maximum security, the color is really nice and it curls well.</li>
    <li> SO PRETTY. LOVE THEM LOVE THEM LOVE THEM. THE PRICE IS A STEAL</li>
    <li> I love this hair. I was a little scared it was going to be thin but no its not. It was like 2 or 3 inches to long but that when scissors come in handy. I got the peacock and couldn&#x27;t be happier. No more frying my hair and worrying my color is going to come out right. I recommend! ! !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be ordering the other colors &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s great .had a lot of fun with easy to use</li>
    <li> Very good for the price</li>
    <li> Is pretty long n nice&lt;br /&gt;I like it.</li>
