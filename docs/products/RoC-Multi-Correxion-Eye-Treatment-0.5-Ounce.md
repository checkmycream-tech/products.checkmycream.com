      <li>i love  it so much that i recommended it to my sister..</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t help so much with the bags, but that&#x27;s okay</li>

      <li>roc is the best this one seems even better then the last one I got and very affordable i recommend it for dark eyes lines bags</li>
      <li>Your skin will be more sensitive while you are treating it with this product.</li>
      <li>The ROC line is really good for low budget skin care - most products include retinol which is essential in preventing lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I used it for one month  and still had wrinkle, laugh lines crow feet.</li>
      <li>so I was looking for a product right for the first wrinkles</li>
      <li>This product reflects all expectations about first wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I as well tried this cream for the first time.</li>
      <li>first time using it</li>
      <li>I learned that the first time.</li>
      <li>I have used many different products on my eyes, but they would irritate my eyes.</li>
      <li>I tried getting more sleep, multivitamins, taking an allergy pill daily etc</li>
      <li>It keeps my eyes soft and supple,is reasonably priced and easy to find .</li>
      <li>It helps with fine lines and gives an overall fresher complexion.</li>
      <li>Great product if the skin around your eyes looks thin, allowing veins to show through.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say whether it stops wrinkles, because I (thank goodness) don&#x27;t really have any yet.      </li>
      <li>The burning is intense.</li>
      <li>and I really see no improvement.  </li>
      <li>did find something else that has worked very well for me.</li>
      <li>It does sting a bit when I first put it on-is that normal??  </li>
      <li>, I guess that was it, but it caused my eyes to wrinkle immediately, so much so that the skin consultant gasped.  </li>
      <li>ROC multi Correxion eye treatment really diminished the discoloration under my eyes</li>
      <li>and they are very swollen.</li>
      <li>Really like ROC and have ordered from this company before,  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much results for the purpose that I purchased it for...dark circles.  </li>
      <li>I was getting ready to contact company, thinking there was a problem.  </li>
      <li>When I ordered it I really thought it would do everything as promised, but after using it every day as directed nothing changed.</li>
      <li>so far it seems to help some , stings a little at first,  but that gets better!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it does anything more than the other RoC eye creams, but I&#x27;m still using it.</li>
      <li>it is best to start introducing retinal products to my skin to help slow down the aging process.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting old so I was looking for a product right for the first wrinkles and I found out it. This product reflects all expectations about first wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I never had an allergy for any kind of an eye cream, after using this product I had an under eye area burning, redness, and swelling, in a few days after the use my skin looked dry and I got more wrinkles then I had before i used it.</li>
    <li> The ROC line is really good for low budget skin care - most products include retinol which is essential in preventing lines and wrinkles. It does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> This product I&#x27;ve been using for years and shows wonderful results. Being in my 50&#x27;s I still look 10 years younger around my eyes. A safe and true product.</li>
    <li> I am a new user of ROC products (since 11/2011) and am very pleased with this product. The application of the cream is smooth with no greasy residue. I did not feel the \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; feeling that some users described. With just 5 months of use I have noticed a more radiant look around my eyes. I am pleased with the results of this product and will continue to use it. Try it- you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> tried this product for about two months and it did nothing for my eyes waist of money and time. Doesn&#x27;t even provided good moisture.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in the hopes that it would lighten my dark under-eye circles which are caused, I believe, by a combination of allergies and heredity.  (Sleep has nothing to do with it, in my case.)      I&#x27;ve been using the treatment 1-2 times a day for over a month and have seen no improvement whatsoever.  I suppose it moisturizes effectively though.  I can&#x27;t say whether it stops wrinkles, because I (thank goodness) don&#x27;t really have any yet.      Also, beware of using this product before applying concealer or yellow stick--it&#x27;s more likely to look cakey.      I had high hopes for this treatment, but alas, another one in the trash.  If I happen to find something that *does* work, I&#x27;ll edit this review to include a recommendation.</li>
    <li> I used this cream as directed for two weeks and it really dried out the skin around my eyes. I occasionally have flare ups of excema and this cream brought it back full force.</li>
    <li> I have tried every eye cream and this one consistently works the best for me. Over use or in combination with prescription strength retin-a may create sensitivity, but it does make the small lines under my eyes nearly disappear.  I tried another cream that I had an allergic reaction to, I guess that was it, but it caused my eyes to wrinkle immediately, so much so that the skin consultant gasped.  Roc got it back to normal. I won&#x27;t switch again.</li>
    <li> Roc&#x27;s best eye cream!</li>
    <li> I have used many different products on my eyes, but they would irritate my eyes. This one was perfect for me.  I am very happy with this one. I would recommend this product for people who have sensitive eyes like me. The cost isn&#x27;t too bad either.</li>
    <li> After just 2 days I had a horrible rash all over my face and neck. It was so bad that I had to go to the doctor and get some hydrocortisone cream for my face. After 3 days of using that the rash is finally starting to go away. Not sure what happened but I will definitely have to return the cream...if I can find my receipt that is.</li>
    <li> Love the product. I received the eye treatment very quickly. This product is great for sensitive skin. Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Sorry however with all the hype they put out there I thought it was going to help me. Must be honest I didn&#x27;t do any research on these RoC products and I am sad they don&#x27;t seem to do anything for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It helps with fine lines and gives an overall fresher complexion. I&#x27;ve actually had multiple people say how young I look when they find out my true age. The minus one star is because I have super sensitive skin and the retinol plus fragrance can irritate sometimes and I&#x27;ll have to take a break. Please,ROC, consider some fragrance free options!!</li>
    <li> Good product, good price</li>
    <li> Skeptical of many creams but thought I&#x27;d try this.  Have dark circles and puffiness under my eyes.  Been using the cream for about 3 weeks and it has made a noticeable improvement.  It hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of them and I didn&#x27;t expect that but it is definitely helping.  It does sting a bit when I first put it on-is that normal??  Hoping to see even more improvement as I use it.</li>
    <li> I had such terrible experience with this product that I had to contact the company about it.  My eyes became so irritated that I had to contact my doctor,  couldn&#x27;t open my eyes for a couple of days &amp; had a rash around my eyes area for two weeks. According to Roc&#x27;s laboratory it was an allergic reaction to retinol.  Please be careful before using this product.</li>
    <li> For me, this was a complete waste of money.  It caused eye redness and tearing if it gets close to my eyes.</li>
    <li> I use RoC.  I thought I would try this eye cream.  I like it.  I don&#x27;t know if it does anything more than the other RoC eye creams, but I&#x27;m still using it.</li>
    <li> awesome product it works but use it everyday.</li>
    <li> When I ordered it I really thought it would do everything as promised, but after using it every day as directed nothing changed. I would not waste my money on this product. They DO NOT keep their promise.&lt;br /&gt;JDG</li>
    <li> This product has a nice texture to it whick applies easily to the under eye area.  It easily absorbs into the skin.  Will purchase again.  I do notice a softness in my under eye skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 2 months. there has not been any changes at all. I like it though because it keeps my eye area moistured. I don&#x27;t know if it prevents your eye-area from having wrinkles...over all it&#x27;s been ok. but no reduction in fine wrinkes.</li>
    <li> Have used for approximately three weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet, so maybe I was expecting too much of a miracle cure for my dark circles.</li>
    <li> so far it seems to help some , stings a little at first,  but that gets better! I like it</li>
    <li> It has a lovely scent. I will order again. I have not used it long enough to notice a difference though</li>
    <li> I have used Roc products for the past 5 years... and I love them! I am very disappointed this wonderful line is no longer available through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program. I hope Amazon will make the line available again through S&amp;S.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other ROC eye creams but this one made me swell and itch around my eyes. I&#x27;ll be switching back to [[ASIN:B0009RFB76 RoC Retinol Correxion Cream Ounce]] as I don&#x27;t react at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sucks when a product makes you look worse.</li>
    <li> It is easily spreaded and quick absorbed, not oily, I like to use ROC brand eye cream, I have been using this brand for a while.</li>
    <li> I as well tried this cream for the first time. After 3 days of use I developed very dry itchy and sore blister like skin on my top eyelids. Discontinued the use and it is going away.</li>
    <li> first time using it and  I like all Roc products. Its a great eye cream but Im also using the Roc Deep wrinckle cream</li>
    <li> Although tube is small it does last quite a while if used sparingly.  Seems to relax skin under and around eyes.</li>
    <li> When I use RoC skin products, my skin looks better. If I shop in a department store, I&#x27;ll spend a minimum of $200 and the ingredients in those high-dollar products aren&#x27;t necessarily effective, just expensive. This product had the ingredients I was looking for. I&#x27;m getting good results. Be sure to protect your skin when you go out in the sun, even in Winter. Your skin will be more sensitive while you are treating it with this product. Also, be SURE not to use any exfoliating products while you are using it. Don&#x27;t use wax on your face. It can cause some unpleasant soreness and skin eruptions. I learned that the first time. Now that I know what NOT to do, I&#x27;m getting excellent results.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!! Great Price for a quality product!.  Use it everyday.  Recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I got a bad rash after using this product. It seems I developed an allergic reaction to it which resulted in puffy red itchy skin around my eyes.  I discontinued immediately. You may wish to take caution and start with very little.</li>
    <li> I brought this because it by roc. but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my face. I used it for one month  and still had wrinkle, laugh lines crow feet. don&#x27;t waist your money</li>
    <li> This is a good eye cream, because I definitely see a differnce in firmness under my eyes when I&#x27;m using it.  It&#x27;s just when I first started using it, my eyes always felt a little itchy, but now I&#x27;m not noticing that anymore.. so maybe my skin just had to get use to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used various products to try and alleviate the dark circles under my eyes. ROC multi Correxion eye treatment really diminished the discoloration under my eyes I was happily surprised. Will definitely buy this product again. It didn&#x27;t help so much with the bags, but that&#x27;s okay it worked on what I needed it too.</li>
    <li> it works. not dramatically but can&#x27;t deny it does work</li>
    <li> Just what I expected. Good product.</li>
    <li> I am a younger male and would normally never use any cosmetic product, but I seem to have permanent dark circles under my eyes. I tried getting more sleep, multivitamins, taking an allergy pill daily etc and nothing seemed to help.   I saw this product and figured I&#x27;d use it at night only to see if it helped and to not have \\&quot;makeup\\&quot; on my face during the day.   I have been using the product now for 6 nights in a row and can already see a significant difference! My dark circles have diminished substantially, and the area under my eyes looks well rested like it should for someone my age.   I realize everyone&#x27;s skin works differently, but for me, using this product has helped and is well worth the price. I plan to continue using it nightly and hope I will see even more improvements.</li>
    <li> Have  been using it for 3 month and haven&#x27;t seen obvious effect on me. The price is good. Will keep using it for a while.</li>
    <li> Great eye cream my eyes look better not as dark and look more supple highly recommend I love it</li>
    <li> RoC is a trusted brand, and I have used several of their other products.  Sometimes retinol based skin care is too harsh on my sensitive skin, but I find this eye cream to be just fine.  Moisture lasts all day and keeps the fine lines away.</li>
    <li> I have fairly dark circles under my eyes. I&#x27;ve used cover ups and various kinds of make up. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of moisturizers, etc. This is the first product I&#x27;ve used that&#x27;s actually lightened my dark circles. I won&#x27;t tell you they are gone, as they are not. However, they are definitely lighter. I can now use less concealer under my eyes helping with a more natural appearance. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much results for the purpose that I purchased it for...dark circles.  But I&#x27;m not sure if there really is one out there.  I&#x27;m going to keep using it daily until I run out and see what kind of results I get!!  It was delivered quickly,  had a date of 2011, hoping that&#x27;s not the expiration date but I&#x27;m thinking it may be!  Shoot!! Lol</li>
    <li> Really like ROC and have ordered from this company before,  Always ontime and in great shape!!  Will order again when needed!</li>
    <li> this is a good product..it definitely does its job.. it helps to blend out the dark circles..i love  it so much that i recommended it to my sister..now she is in love with it..so now i guess she will be buying it from now on ..lol</li>
    <li> I love ROC! I use Roc for 4 years I never quite! Best creme in the world!I never use before this one , this is just ok.</li>
    <li> I tried the product and it is somehow giving me a little burning sensation. I want to go back to the plain RocRetinol correction eye cream. It helps with my deep wrinkles and tired eye look. My co workers can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m 65 years old[[ASIN:B0018S8NNE RoC Multi-Correxion Eye Treatment, 0.5-Ounce Tube]]</li>
    <li> roc is the best this one seems even better then the last one I got and very affordable i recommend it for dark eyes lines bags</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 2 months now and I can honestly say I noticed a difference within 2 weeks. My under eyes are not as puffy. They seem younger and brighter and tighter. I&#x27;m almost 30 years old and I heard at my age it is best to start introducing retinal products to my skin to help slow down the aging process. I will be ordering this product again. I am definitely pleased with my results.</li>
    <li> My problem is dark circles more than wrinkles or bags and I&#x27;ve been very happy with the results.  The dark circles are improving and I think my eye area looks brighter and younger.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re interested in this to help with dark circles under your eyes then don&#x27;t bother spending the money. It doesn&#x27;t do anything for dark circles. I don&#x27;t know what I expected. Nothing works.</li>
    <li> Both of my eyes have chemical burns from this product. I&#x27;ve used ROC products before with no issue so I&#x27;m concerned. What is different with this one or this tube? I have scabs all around my eyes and they are very swollen. The burning is intense.</li>
    <li> very happy using the eye cream, my skin is not quite has dry. will order cream again, will tell others.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT is awesome. I have to work in the morning and do not get alot of sleep the night before. This product helps minimize bags and the look of lack of sleep. A LITTLE DAB WILL do ya.</li>
    <li> It did not lighten the dark circles under my eyes and after 3 days of applying, it started burning when I would apply again. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many eye creams, and this is the only one that I have actually seen results with.  I look less tired, and I look younger!  Love!</li>
    <li> I have used this eye cream for about two years and won&#x27;t use anything else. I have tried several brands of eye cream, including the pricey ones from Sephora, Oil of Olay, Clinique, etc. This one beats them all. You only need a tiny bit under each eye so one bottle lasts at least 3 months. The results are great--reduces eye puffiness, makes skin appear tighter and younger. Fabulous!</li>
    <li> My skin is pretty sensitive, so I was worried this cream might irritate it since it is anti-wrinkle (and I&#x27;m in my 20s). It&#x27;s been a month, and I have noticed that my usual dark circles have lightened. There is no irritation whatsoever, and I use it both morning and night.  A little goes a long way, and I love the velvety texture.</li>
    <li> not a 100% cure all but for the price its OK&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many brands and this seems to be the best at&lt;br /&gt;keeping my puffines and dark circles to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m yet to find something that completely removes them !</li>
    <li> Remember, no anti-aging cream works as a miracle but this brand has visibly reduced my wrinkles. I got it online because I had bought it in stores and had worked for me, so why change? The same product is not necessarily good on everyone&#x27;s skin. What I recommend women is to try it.</li>
    <li> Have been using these for a number of years.  A very good product</li>
    <li> The product works just fine.  but it did take an extra long time to receive product.  I was getting ready to contact company, thinking there was a problem.  They should have contacted me to let me know when product would arrive.</li>
    <li> using it for 2 mths now..very good moisturizer and keeps skin supple and smooth.use it daily as a routine after face wash</li>
    <li> It keeps my eyes soft and supple,is reasonably priced and easy to find . I would recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> I saw no noticeable improvement in the appearance of my eyes after several months of use.. I have no doubt it works for other people, so I wouldn&#x27;t discourage anyone from trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find something else that has worked very well for me. If anyone would like to know what I&#x27;m using, just leave a comment</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference and it hurt my sensitive eye area.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever used this product and it is wonderful!!!  I definitely recommend it to my family</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple months and thus far, I&#x27;m not impressed.  It smells like a bad men&#x27;s cologne from the 70&#x27;s and I really see no improvement.  I think, I&#x27;ll be going back to Loreal!</li>
    <li> The eye cream has completely helped my darkness under my eyes. I could tell with in a week my skin was not as transparent. Great product if the skin around your eyes looks thin, allowing veins to show through.</li>
