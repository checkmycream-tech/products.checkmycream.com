      <li>It arrived in great condition and the scent is really good.  </li>
      <li>I love all their products and their body wash is great, I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a great product.</li>
      <li>large bottle for a good price, and it smells great.</li>
      <li>Cost more than CVS brand, but you will get more washes per bottle and not end up smelling like your heading out to go clubbing!</li>
      <li>I sometimes worry that these don&#x27;t actually clean you and that they just smell good</li>
      <li>The fragrance is fairly mild but pleasant.</li>
      <li>I was pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and my skin feels healthy.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the most cost-effective I found.  </li>
      <li>I will be ordering more of this body wash.</li>
      <li>You get a reasonable amount for the price and it lathers up great.</li>
      <li>Amazon has much better deals than the salons on these products.</li>
      <li>Love the smell of this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff, its natural clean smelling, and makes you feel great with your morning shower/bath.</li>
      <li>I used this, it smelled ok and didn&#x27;t cause me to get a rash like some cheaper body washes do, but I didn&#x27;t feel like it made me all that clean</li>
      <li>so the price is justified.</li>
      <li>I use it after the gym for a refreshed clean feeling.  </li>
      <li>I was very surprised how much I liked it.</li>
      <li>This is another good product from American Crew.</li>
      <li>It pairs great with the other Crew products including the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>It smells great, has a very nice lather, and a little goes a long way</li>
      <li>I liked it so well, I&#x27;ve purchased several full sized items for myself and others, here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Tea Tree has worked well for me in other products and the body wash is very invigorating first thing in the morning and a great size to bring to the gym.</li>
      <li>I like them both, but this is a favorite, especially after a hot day or after exercise.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a clean smell, somewhat antiseptic, but not heavy in odor like the Tea Tree wash I have also tried.</li>
      <li>I would describe it if I could, but it doesn&#x27;t have a specific herbal fragrance, just a clean and fresh smell.</li>
      <li>good size, and last a long time.</li>
      <li>This stuff is pretty decent.</li>
      <li>I really like this product</li>
      <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Lathers very well.  </li>
      <li>This body wash really cleans and disinfects the germs.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also cheaper than most of the other Tea Tree products.</li>
      <li>The scent is unique but not overwhelming and manages to blend the (often strong) scent of tea tree oil</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not masculine, with a men&#x27;s cologne fragrance, so it&#x27;s perfectly fine for both men and women.</li>
      <li>However, I did not like it as well as the classic body wash.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself to have an abnormal degree of slime on my skin, just the normal stuff a guy gets from going about his day and doing yard work, etc.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say this is my favorite body wash in the past 5 years.</li>
      <li>I bought a small sample of this on the Minimus site (a very fun samples site).</li>
      <li>This is my second bottle, and I don&#x27;t plan on switching to anything else in the near future.  </li>

<li> And while it may seem a little expensive, the 15.2 Ounce size lasts for months.</li>
<li> Very irritating if you get it in your eyes.</li>

    <li> This stuff is pretty decent. The fragrance is fairly mild but pleasant. Rinses well. Very irritating if you get it in your eyes.</li>
    <li> I love all their products and their body wash is great, I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a great product.</li>
    <li> Product smells and feels great. I bought this along with the American Crew shave oil and I&#x27;m very happy. This is definitely a step up from your basic CVS brands.</li>

    <li> Great body wash. I sometimes worry that these don&#x27;t actually clean you and that they just smell good but this one does both. It&#x27;s also cheaper than most of the other Tea Tree products.</li>

    <li> bought this for my son, for Christmas, who says that he loves it and would continue to use it. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product.  Doesn&#x27;t really dry out skin.  I use it too.  Smells great.  I recommend this to men</li>
    <li> This is another good product from American Crew. However, I did not like it as well as the classic body wash.</li>
    <li> It smells great. Lasts long. I was very surprised how much I liked it. I will be ordering more of this body wash.</li>
    <li> I used this, it smelled ok and didn&#x27;t cause me to get a rash like some cheaper body washes do, but I didn&#x27;t feel like it made me all that clean, I still felt like a lot of the sweat and body oil was still present after I got out of the shower.  I&#x27;m not a porn star, oiled up body builder, or oil rig worker, so I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself to have an abnormal degree of slime on my skin, just the normal stuff a guy gets from going about his day and doing yard work, etc.</li>

    <li> I love this stuff, its natural clean smelling, and makes you feel great with your morning shower/bath. I will keep buying the American Crew brand of products.</li>

    <li> I really like this product and it&#x27;s the most cost-effective I found.  Lathers very well.  Tea tree oil is known for killing bacteria/viruses/fungus so it&#x27;s great for anyone who does MMA</li>
    <li> I have had Bacne for my entire life.  My dermatologist recommended using a wash that had Tea Tree Oil in it to help.  This body wash really cleans and disinfects the germs.</li>
