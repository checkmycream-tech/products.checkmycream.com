      <li>I&#x27;m a med, myself, and was surprised how good this stuff is.</li>
      <li>I first used it with Brilliant (love love love) then with the complete Dry Remedy range</li>
      <li>Totally worth the price, which I always regret - except this time!</li>
      <li>I could not stress enough how effective this product is!</li>
      <li>Applying it to my highlighted hair brings the life and look of a young and healthy hair!  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s pure, unlike most argon oil hair products.)</li>
      <li>GREAT product for styling and dry hair!!</li>
      <li>I love the fact that you only need 3-4 drops, and probably 2 more</li>
      <li>My hair is so soft and had amazing shine with the first use.  </li>
      <li>Its smells good and helps my dry ends</li>
      <li>Well, this was the first product I tried and I was hooked!</li>
      <li>would I know what I was talking about, if I liked a product I could order one for my personal use.</li>
      <li>I put it on right out of the shower, at which time it spreads and absorbs optimally - not that it doesn&#x27;t always disappear.</li>
      <li>I went from being amused by the anonymous person&#x27;s audacity to being very, very grateful.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this to people I know and to you too &amp;#34;reader of my review&amp;#34; :)</li>
      <li>and this was the first time I reached for it.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t greasy at all, it dries and disappears, leaving your hair soft, sleek and so so smooth.</li>
      <li>I personally love the scent of essential oils and it works</li>
      <li>This is the first Aveda product I&#x27;ve purchased that hasn&#x27;t worked.</li>
      <li>When I first started I was completely against the line because I had a love for another product line and didn&#x27;t want to try anything new.</li>
      <li>The scent is very nature like, very earthy, tree/ plant odor which I don&#x27;t mind at all!  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
      <li>It disappeared instantly leaving my skin as smooth as can be with no hint of residue.</li>
      <li>This was a gentle nudge by who</li>
      <li>In the south, it&#x27;s very humid.</li>
      <li>Does not spread very well in hair.</li>
      <li>I was not so much into the idea of adding oil to my already oily hair.</li>
      <li>This is a really nice oil, not too heavy.</li>
      <li>I live most of the time in an extremely dry climate</li>
      <li>I tried out a new salon, and they give away the 3ml tube to new clients.</li>
      <li>this cuts down on blow drying and keeps your hair smooth.</li>
      <li>I really like this product and will definitely order it again.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;re supposed to look professional.</li>
      <li>but I guess if you don&#x27;t like the smells of natural oils like lavender</li>
      <li>Sunflower seed oil, dicaprylyl maleate (preservative for oils), dicaprylyl ether (emollient oil derived from coconut and Palm Kernel Oils), methyl soyate (ester derived from soybean oil), polyglyceryl-10 pentaoleate (emulsifying agent), olive oil, buriti fruit oil, pomegranate sterols, tocopherol (vitamin E agent), fragrance, farnesol (plant extract used for fragrance), linalool (natural fragrance), benzyl salicylate (natural fragrance), citronellol (natural fragrance), citral (natural fragrance), limonene (natural fragrance), benzyl benzoate (synthetic fragrance), coumarin (synthetic fragrance), geraniol (natural fragrance).</li>
      <li>My hair used to be really long and somewhat wild - well, really wild.</li>
      <li>The benefits of this oil far outweigh the smell (which disappears after a short time).  </li>
      <li>I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s such a tiny little bottle at a really big price and my hair is so huge and curly and frizzy</li>
      <li>It felt normal and dry, yet it was softer, de poofed and didn&#x27;t frizz out.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t praise this stuff enough because I have a phobia regarding gunk on my skin, so I really have to need moisturizing to use typical lotions.</li>
      <li>It seems you either love or hate the fragrance, so maybe start off with the 3ml sample and see how you like it first!</li>

<li> Normally, Aveda products don&#x27;t work for me, except for a few select items.</li>
<li> Also, very little goes really far.</li>

<li> /&gt;You can get this with your eyes closed.</li>

<li> I have thick, coarse, curly hair that craves moisture.  </li>
<li> I have tried other products before I using the straightening or curling iron, and this item tops them all!</li>
<li> As soon as a apply a few drops on my thick long  dry colored hair, I immediately noticed the difference!</li>
<li> if you have long thick hair to do touch up on its ends.</li>
<li> Not much better than other over the counter products.</li>
<li> /&gt;My poor waist length hair is damaged by 3 years of chemical dyes (red, using developer every time I dye.. ouch) and swimming in chlorinated pools.</li>
<li> and I was until then unable to find a natural product to moisturize my hair,</li>
<li> I had to use 1/2 of the bottle to tame it.</li>
<li> and I just cannot get past the funky smell.  </li>
<li> I was skeptical, since the salon sells the bigger bottle</li>
<li> The product works pretty well, but the smell is awful!!  </li>
<li> I was reading some of the reviews wondering why people didn&#x27;t like this product and a few people stated that it smells bad.</li>
<li> It smoothes my crazy thick hair</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m always wary of salons trying to sell hair products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This oil is so amazing!! I can notice a total difference in my hair after using it a few times! The smell is Devine! I would definitely recommend this to people I know and to you too &amp;#34;reader of my review&amp;#34; :)</li>
    <li> Its smells good and helps my dry ends</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse, curly hair that craves moisture.  I blow it out and flat iron my hair which naturally creates damage, not to mention the hair color, yet it is difficult to tell when using this oil.  The benefits of this oil far outweigh the smell (which disappears after a short time).  My hair is so soft and had amazing shine with the first use.  I put it on at night before I go to bed and sometimes before work.  It looks very healthy and bouncy.  I really like this product and will definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Very light weight and get the job done!</li>
    <li> This is the first Aveda product I&#x27;ve purchased that hasn&#x27;t worked. It doesn&#x27;t produce the results it claims and it has an unpleasant smell.</li>
    <li> The product works pretty well, but the smell is awful!!  I have only used this product 3x and I just cannot get past the funky smell.  Try a different product.</li>
    <li> After the most amazing haircut at Azzedine &amp; Laurent in Paris, I bought the Brilliant range and offered me a handful of sample, in which I had the lovely surprise to discover this oil. I was not so much into the idea of adding oil to my already oily hair. I live most of the time in an extremely dry climate and I was until then unable to find a natural product to moisturize my hair, so I gave this a go. And what a wonderful surprise !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After blowdrying my hair, I put 5-10 drop (I have a LOT of volume) in my hand then distribute it from the roots to the ends. This isn&#x27;t greasy at all, it dries and disappears, leaving your hair soft, sleek and so so smooth. I first used it with Brilliant (love love love) then with the complete Dry Remedy range and it&#x27;s just as amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get this with your eyes closed. You&#x27;ll never regret it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how well this product works, I just couldn&#x27;t get passed this smell!  The smell is horrible and I cannot describe it.</li>
    <li> I love the way this stuff smells and how it makes my hair feel. I prefer to use it when my hair is wet because it makes it look greasy when I put it in when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
    <li> Not much better than other over the counter products.</li>
    <li> this cuts down on blow drying and keeps your hair smooth.</li>
    <li> I was reading some of the reviews wondering why people didn&#x27;t like this product and a few people stated that it smells bad. I have used this product for a month now and I love it. It smoothes my crazy thick hair and I think it smells awesome. Everything I&#x27;ve used from aveda I thought smelled great but I guess if you don&#x27;t like the smells of natural oils like lavender don&#x27;t get this product.</li>
    <li> I work at a salon that sells Aveda products exclusively. When I first started I was completely against the line because I had a love for another product line and didn&#x27;t want to try anything new. However, my manager gave me all these samples to test out the products so not only would I know what I was talking about, if I liked a product I could order one for my personal use. Well, this was the first product I tried and I was hooked! All you need is four drops on your palm, rub them together, then all over your hair specifically at the ends and voila! Smooth, healthy feeling hair within a matter of seconds! Now a day doesn&#x27;t go by that I don&#x27;t use this product on my hair (along with many more Aveda products!)</li>
    <li> Seems like a legit product. Smells like it should and came intact.</li>
    <li> very good product and shipped quick</li>
    <li> Love itbits a perfect everyday hair oil,especially for curly-kinky hair</li>
    <li> Amazing product with many uses. Somebody left a sample of this stuff (.1 oz tube) on my desk at work as a hint. My hair used to be really long and somewhat wild - well, really wild. It&#x27;s short now. We&#x27;re supposed to look professional. I looked like a caged animal. This was a gentle nudge by who, I still don&#x27;t know. Anyway, I threw the stuff in my pocketbook and forgot about it until one day I needed lotion for my hands. There was no indication on the tube that it was for you hair, so all that time I was saving it for when I needed a moisturizer on the road and this was the first time I reached for it. It was AMAZING! I rubbed it on my hands and up my forearms. It disappeared instantly leaving my skin as smooth as can be with no hint of residue. The difference was VISIBLE and long lasting. I went from being amused by the anonymous person&#x27;s audacity to being very, very grateful. It&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever in my life used. Only when I went to order some here did I see that it&#x27;s for your hair. At that point, who cares? I personally love the scent of essential oils and it works so well I&#x27;ve been proselytizing. I now use it as body and face oil. It even works great on your feet. Also, very little goes really far. I put it on right out of the shower, at which time it spreads and absorbs optimally - not that it doesn&#x27;t always disappear. I can&#x27;t praise this stuff enough because I have a phobia regarding gunk on my skin, so I really have to need moisturizing to use typical lotions. This stuff works better than any lotion and disappears to boot. I hope they never stop making it.</li>
    <li> Love, Love this stuff</li>
    <li> Normally, Aveda products don&#x27;t work for me, except for a few select items. This was one the ones that worked. In the south, it&#x27;s very humid. This moisturized my hair without leaving it oily, greasy or smelly. It felt normal and dry, yet it was softer, de poofed and didn&#x27;t frizz out. I have type 2 - is hair, though it&#x27;s maybe a 3 ish on the crown of my head - that&#x27;s where I have the most problem in the summer which is keeping it de poofed and the crown of frizz under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywho- if you&#x27;re a course mediterranean or dominican or a jew fro -ish type, this might work for you. I&#x27;m a med, myself, and was surprised how good this stuff is. Totally worth the price, which I always regret - except this time!</li>
    <li> Excellent and works like it says!</li>
    <li> awesome im beyond im love super happy super excited super comfortable</li>
    <li> As soon as a apply a few drops on my thick long  dry colored hair, I immediately noticed the difference! I have tried other products before I using the straightening or curling iron, and this item tops them all! I love the fact that you only need 3-4 drops, and probably 2 more if you have long thick hair to do touch up on its ends. My hair is shiny and leaves a faint scent (not that I don&#x27;t want it, but prefer no scent on my pillows) while you apply it. The scent is very nature like, very earthy, tree/ plant odor which I don&#x27;t mind at all!  It is oil, but because you do not need a lot, my hair feels light and no oily feeling at all.  Applying it to my highlighted hair brings the life and look of a young and healthy hair!  I could not stress enough how effective this product is! I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff! I tried out a new salon, and they give away the 3ml tube to new clients. I was skeptical, since the salon sells the bigger bottle and I&#x27;m always wary of salons trying to sell hair products. However, I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a chance!&lt;br /&gt;My poor waist length hair is damaged by 3 years of chemical dyes (red, using developer every time I dye.. ouch) and swimming in chlorinated pools. I love this stuff becuase it does better than any leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve tried, and it isn&#x27;t loaded with silicones, so I know it&#x27;s actually helping my hair, rather than just covering up damage. Actually it has zero silicones- awesome! Which is important to me, I&#x27;m done with just covering up damage with silicones which can actually make things worse over time. So this is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I love using 3 drops of this and 5 drops of argan oil together as my detangler and leave in conditioner. (I get my argan oil from Mountian Rose herbs so it&#x27;s pure, unlike most argon oil hair products.) It seems you either love or hate the fragrance, so maybe start off with the 3ml sample and see how you like it first! Even the tiny bottle lasts a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients are as follows : Sunflower seed oil, dicaprylyl maleate (preservative for oils), dicaprylyl ether (emollient oil derived from coconut and Palm Kernel Oils), methyl soyate (ester derived from soybean oil), polyglyceryl-10 pentaoleate (emulsifying agent), olive oil, buriti fruit oil, pomegranate sterols, tocopherol (vitamin E agent), fragrance, farnesol (plant extract used for fragrance), linalool (natural fragrance), benzyl salicylate (natural fragrance), citronellol (natural fragrance), citral (natural fragrance), limonene (natural fragrance), benzyl benzoate (synthetic fragrance), coumarin (synthetic fragrance), geraniol (natural fragrance).</li>
    <li> This is a really nice oil, not too heavy. I love the smell, but I love everything from Aveda. I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s such a tiny little bottle at a really big price and my hair is so huge and curly and frizzy I had to use 1/2 of the bottle to tame it. Won&#x27;t be buying again for that reason alone - can&#x27;t afford it!</li>
    <li> GREAT product for styling and dry hair!! Love the shine!</li>
    <li> good oil for my hair. works well</li>
    <li> Does not spread very well in hair.</li>
    <li> My hair never looked better!</li>
</ol>
