      <li>A small squirt in my hand that is about the size of a quarter gives me really good suds, which lets this size bottle last a very long time (even when doing a quick wash at least 5 times per week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
      <li>thick hair that can get oily if not regularly washed, and this shampoo keeps it clean feeling.</li>

    <li> I used this product and it has lasted a long time!!! A good shampoo.  My only complaint is that the bottle top is very hard to open and close - you can&#x27;t do it with one hand for sure.</li>
    <li> Much better than what I expected...great product and great price.&lt;br /&gt;I really like pantene and this shampoo works very well for me.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy.  The 2 pack is nice because I don&#x27;t need to buy as often.</li>
    <li> I was in Colorado not to long ago on vacation, and I wanted to go swimming. Well I brought shampoo that&#x27;s to get the crap out of hair with the spray in conditioner. My hair started getting very very dry. Well I didn&#x27;t go swimming on the third or fourth day, and I was desperate for shampoo and conditioner that wouldn&#x27;t dry my hair out like it has been. Well I looked at what the hotel had and usually it&#x27;s not that great, well it was this with the conditioner, I figured what did I have to lose? So I got done with my shower, and I was amazed how great this stuff is! I didn&#x27;t even have to use leave in conditioner like I always do. So soft!! Then I got home, where the water is a lot better! And took my shower with it a few days later, since I went back to using my regular stuff. Well I&#x27;m impressed a lot, no having to use leave in conditioner either. And I had less shedding. My hair type is wavy, little bit below waist length, I&#x27;m growing it out towards my tailbone. I always have to use leave in conditioner and use deep conditioner on a daily basis. I get split ends and hair breakage, and they said your hair can&#x27;t split along the hair shaft, well mine does. I will have to use this on a month to month basis and see if it improves that, I hate split ends!</li>
    <li> I prefer a strong scent but for my dog, she has no problem</li>
    <li> The apocalypse will come before I run out of shampoo again. I hope the zombies are hairy. Like really hairy.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is by far my favorite. It smells amazing and the smell lasts all day. It leaves my hair feeling smooth and silky. My hair is thin and I have a lot of split ends. I see a huge difference since I started using it. My hair is fuller, shinier, and overall much healthier and manageable. HIGHLY recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a heavy box with the two bottles. Well packaged, it arrived on time with no damage.  Pantene is nice shampoo and this particular item in their line was liked by all in our family.</li>
    <li> I have always loved to use Panteen Pro-V. This is my first time using this kind. I really liked how my hair feels and the scent of the product. I couldn&#x27;t beat the price. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Smell: clean, not overpowering,&lt;br /&gt;Feel: keeps my hair smooth and silky&lt;br /&gt;Price: unbeatable, better than the department stores!&lt;br /&gt;Convenience: delivered straight to your door, any time you want</li>
    <li> I only use pantene nature I was using a different one but tried this one out. for my hair which is long, fine and tends to be oliy this shampoo has to much oil in it. I wanted to like it but it left my hair flat and even if I washed it in the morning by the night it it was greasy. the smell is light and not over powering.</li>
    <li> I washed my few hairs with this stuff and it was great. I wouldn&#x27;t squirt it in your eyes though. My eyes rate this item very badly, but they are a little prejudiced.</li>
    <li> Went through the gamut of designer shampoos, and those with green tea and mint, only to come back to this Pantene product. Some of the others felt just about as nice as this one does, but they often ended up irritating my scalp whereas Pantene never does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like is how a little bit goes a very long way. A small squirt in my hand that is about the size of a quarter gives me really good suds, which lets this size bottle last a very long time (even when doing a quick wash at least 5 times per week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have thick hair that can get oily if not regularly washed, and this shampoo keeps it clean feeling. Play volleyball and tennis and really have the need to shower well after matches, and like this shampoo a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend it if you have a similar need.</li>
    <li> Got it when it was a deal. My wife uses it and I guess she likes it because she never complained about it.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair which has some wave/frizz to it.  It needs taming and this shampoo, along with Pantene&#x27;s smoothing conditioner, do a really good job.  Also doesn&#x27;t strip the hair.</li>
    <li> I wanted a good shampoo for the price and this seemed to be what I needed seems to work well with my hair</li>
    <li> i always love pantene shampoo especially nature fusion it makes my hair so smooth everytime i use this.</li>
    <li> great value w/ promotion,Thanks</li>
    <li> I am a Pantene shampoo user for many years. I found the fusion version really good and cleans my hair thoroughly. Shampooing ends brings the right texture to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have oily hair type which tends to become oily by the end of the day. So I would suggest this  one for similar hair type.</li>
