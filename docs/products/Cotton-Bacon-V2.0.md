      <li>the best one out there for dripping...</li>
      <li>AMAZING STUFF!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not arguing whether X, Y, or Z is the best wicking material.  </li>
      <li>so I ordered this not know what to expect, but I am VERY happy with it in my aqua V2 (RBA tank system)</li>
      <li>LOL.  </li>
      <li>It work great..</li>
      <li>makes all my juuces EXPLODE with the great flavor i was meant to taste.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Great product wont use anything else.</li>
      <li>Amazing flavor!</li>
      <li>Great seller fast shipping awesome..</li>
      <li>but I wasn&#x27;t very satisfied</li>
      <li>Thank you for the great product great packaging and fast shipping!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>it wicks up amazing.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the great experience!</li>
      <li>There are fans of cotton, rayon, ramie, stainless mesh, and you can probably even find somebody somewhere still screaming on a forum in CAPS that porous ceramic is the best,</li>
      <li>But speaking of pork (bacon), I&#x27;ll bet you there are some nice profit margins throughout the supply chain...    </li>
      <li>just as described and well worth the money.definite buy!!!</li>
      <li>and it is very easy.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and has amazing flavor!</li>
      <li>Flavor with this was so much better.</li>
      <li>This is nothing more than unrolled, dental cotton...</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more</li>
      <li>Heck, if people are happy buying little packs of cotton somebody says is optimum for vaping, and you agree and want to buy the product, then go for it.    </li>
      <li>Resealable bag makes it easy to travel with as well.</li>
      <li>Cotton was easy to pull and easy to roll.</li>
      <li>Very quick shipping as well.</li>
      <li>Best cotton on the market for vaping hands down.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast, cotton comes in a nice package.</li>
      <li>If your looking for incredible flavor and absolutely No cotton taste than this is what you want!</li>
      <li>Plus everything is better with bacon ;)</li>
      <li>Not to mention it is most likely just repackaged drntsl gauze which you can purchase for a 10th of the price for so much more.</li>
      <li>Once i started to vape it, tasted mildly like chemicals for about 2 mills of juice then sub sided.</li>
      <li>But there&#x27;s really nothing very special about this stuff, even if cotton is what you swear by -- it&#x27;s not organic cotton that hasn&#x27;t been treated with chemicals</li>
      <li>Great easy to use and enough to last for like 3-6 months</li>
      <li>Think about this -- the best wicking materials that have been found thus far are not vape specialty products, mass-produced and pre-packaged into neat little retail packs at your corner vape shop.  </li>
      <li>Amazing product, will definitely buy again.</li>
      <li>Great american made cotton no boiling necessary makes the vape experience much more tasty than the Japanese cotton for sure</li>
      <li>Right from the start</li>
      <li>My point is, this is not very cost effective.    </li>
      <li>Really does add a crisp taste.&lt;br /&gt;The way that you could course</li>
      <li>Solid cotton, easy straight out of the package.</li>
      <li>fast shipping even to apo adresses&lt;</li>
      <li>And fast shipping.</li>
      <li>All I&#x27;m saying is that in a few hours of ECF forums reading or startpage searches, you can find all the info you need about effective and very inexpensive wicking material - including chemically treated and processed cotton if that&#x27;s what you like - andwhere to get it.  </li>
      <li>this stuff is pure white, so it HAS been chemically treated.  </li>
      <li>The cotton is pure white which organic is not.</li>
      <li>How can it be organic and un bleached if it is pure white and no organic flakes in it.  </li>
      <li>I am conservative with my wick material to limit waste and this will last me far more than 45 builds.</li>
      <li>$15-$20 can get you a near lifetime supply of high-quality wicking material, even if you do re-wick every 5ml.  </li>
      <li>small package but densely packed easy to separate.</li>
      <li>I see juice in the wick,but this cotton bacon always Vapes to the last drop of juice which I like,I purchase this just because there&#x27;s is no boiling or any other special needs like cotton balls and u</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s decent cotton,it does feel different then regular organic cotton,it is easy to works with and a little does go a long way,its texture is almost like Japanese pads but has a cotton ball feel,I&#x27;m not a fan of Japanese pads</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve used organic japanese cotton for a long time</li>
<li> that has a dry hit even tho</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s not particularly well priced if you do any research.  </li>
<li> Used this for a few weeks then tried going back to jap cotton.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a lot of $$$ to pay for such a relatively small amount of cotton.    </li>
<li> There is at least one wick material which is widely known that you don&#x27;t have to constantly re-wick, but I&#x27;ll leave that for the reader to research.  </li>
<li> ,I gave this cotton a ratings of 4 just because there is a cotton taste to it at the beginning of a new build but goes away after about 10 hits,but does not taste weird at all,it taste organic,but I guess it subjective</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll give you a few hints, though:  \\&quot;Graham</li>
<li> To use this would be rather expensive in the long run.  </li>
<li> ; Even dry hits dont taste bad (I know hard to believe) defiantly going to buy again!</li>
<li> That&#x27;s a matter of opinion and that opinion is wrong.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not particularly impressed with it.    </li>

    <li> Amazing flavor! Resealable bag makes it easy to travel with as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s decent cotton,it does feel different then regular organic cotton,it is easy to works with and a little does go a long way,its texture is almost like Japanese pads but has a cotton ball feel,I&#x27;m not a fan of Japanese pads cause I feel that it can&#x27;t keep up with my chain vape and there&#x27;s always some juice left in Japanese wicking that I can not vape that has a dry hit even tho I see juice in the wick,but this cotton bacon always Vapes to the last drop of juice which I like,I purchase this just because there&#x27;s is no boiling or any other special needs like cotton balls and u can tell that it was made for vapers when u pinch a piece off cause nothing compares to this at all,I gave this cotton a ratings of 4 just because there is a cotton taste to it at the beginning of a new build but goes away after about 10 hits,but does not taste weird at all,it taste organic,but I guess it subjective</li>
    <li> Solid cotton, easy straight out of the package.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used organic japanese cotton for a long time but I wasn&#x27;t very satisfied so I ordered this not know what to expect, but I am VERY happy with it in my aqua V2 (RBA tank system) Will definitely reorder when I need to! Plus everything is better with bacon ;)</li>
    <li> salat easier to deal with than cotton balls although I wish the price was a lot cheaper</li>
    <li> I got a sampler of this stuffed into an order I received a couple weeks ago.  I&#x27;m not particularly impressed with it.    To use this would be rather expensive in the long run.  It&#x27;s a lot of $$$ to pay for such a relatively small amount of cotton.    You should also read around on ECF and elsewhere -- there is even one review pointing it out here -- this stuff is pure white, so it HAS been chemically treated.  And some people have noticed a taste.    I&#x27;m not arguing whether X, Y, or Z is the best wicking material.  There are fans of cotton, rayon, ramie, stainless mesh, and you can probably even find somebody somewhere still screaming on a forum in CAPS that porous ceramic is the best, LOL.  My point is, this is not very cost effective.    Think about this -- the best wicking materials that have been found thus far are not vape specialty products, mass-produced and pre-packaged into neat little retail packs at your corner vape shop.  I can see this maybe being convenient, or maybe doing in a pinch if cotton is your thing.  But there&#x27;s really nothing very special about this stuff, even if cotton is what you swear by -- it&#x27;s not organic cotton that hasn&#x27;t been treated with chemicals and it&#x27;s not particularly well priced if you do any research.  But speaking of pork (bacon), I&#x27;ll bet you there are some nice profit margins throughout the supply chain...    It&#x27;s just my opinion, but I see this product as a retail marketing strategy.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s \\&quot;evil\\&quot; for vape shops and e-tailers or even the manufacturer of this product to make a profit or anything like that.  Heck, if people are happy buying little packs of cotton somebody says is optimum for vaping, and you agree and want to buy the product, then go for it.    All I&#x27;m saying is that in a few hours of ECF forums reading or startpage searches, you can find all the info you need about effective and very inexpensive wicking material - including chemically treated and processed cotton if that&#x27;s what you like - andwhere to get it.  $15-$20 can get you a near lifetime supply of high-quality wicking material, even if you do re-wick every 5ml.  There is at least one wick material which is widely known that you don&#x27;t have to constantly re-wick, but I&#x27;ll leave that for the reader to research.  I&#x27;ll give you a few hints, though:  \\&quot;Graham Professional\\&quot;, \\&quot;beauty supplies\\&quot; and \\&quot;44060\\&quot;.      Totally up to you, of course.</li>
    <li> makes all my juuces EXPLODE with the great flavor i was meant to taste. I will never buy any cotton unless its from these guys!</li>
    <li> Great easy to use and enough to last for like 3-6 months</li>
    <li> Great product wont use anything else.</li>
    <li> Using Cotton Bacon cotton as wicking material for your Kanger/Evod  rebuild  coils is a must in my opinion.  Nuff said...or else they&#x27;ll just jack up the price!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed that weird cotton taste that I usually get for the first few puffs, and it does a good job wicking the juice. One pack will probably last me six to eight months.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, will definitely buy again. Very quick shipping as well. Thanks for the great experience!</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, cotton comes in a nice package. Cotton was easy to pull and easy to roll. Once i started to vape it, tasted mildly like chemicals for about 2 mills of juice then sub sided. The cotton is pure white which organic is not. Will I buy this product again no but that&#x27;s my opinion could be different for others.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Right from the start it wicks up amazing. There&#x27;s no break in perioperiod and no cotton Flavor. It last quite awhile too. I will be ordering more</li>
    <li> As advertised!  Thank you for the great product great packaging and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> As advertised, no boiling necessary. I am conservative with my wick material to limit waste and this will last me far more than 45 builds. small package but densely packed easy to separate.</li>
    <li> Used this for a few weeks then tried going back to jap cotton. Flavor with this was so much better. Will continue to use exclusively.</li>
    <li> Great american made cotton no boiling necessary makes the vape experience much more tasty than the Japanese cotton for sure</li>
    <li> This is nothing more than unrolled, dental cotton... yes it is organically grown, but it is peroxided/sterilized so as it can be used in dental procedures like extractions. You can get a lifetime supply of sterile dental cotton, 500 rolls, for 14.95 here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> How can it be organic and un bleached if it is pure white and no organic flakes in it.  Its obviously processed.  Not to mention it is most likely just repackaged drntsl gauze which you can purchase for a 10th of the price for so much more.</li>
    <li> Great seller fast shipping awesome.. A++</li>
    <li> A lot of people are saying this is just a gimmick to buy over priced cotton. That&#x27;s a matter of opinion and that opinion is wrong. If your looking for incredible flavor and absolutely No cotton taste than this is what you want! I&#x27;ve given this to several friends of mine who are what you could call inthusiasts and they all said the same thing... &amp;#34;WOW... Just WOW!!!&amp;#34; Even dry hits dont taste bad (I know hard to believe) defiantly going to buy again!</li>
    <li> fast shipping even to apo adresses&lt;br /&gt;will buy again</li>
    <li> Really does add a crisp taste.&lt;br /&gt;The way that you could course and it is very easy.</li>
    <li> AMAZING STUFF!!! just as described and well worth the money.definite buy!!!</li>
    <li> It work great..the best one out there for dripping...</li>
    <li> Best cotton on the market for vaping hands down. I have tried multiple types of wick and I always go back to cotton bacon. Will be buying regularly</li>
    <li> Great product. And fast shipping. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and has amazing flavor! Will definitely buy again!!</li>
