<li> You also don&#x27;t need that much but even if you go a bit overboard it won&#x27;t make your hair weighed down or greasy.</li>
<li> My hair was dry and frizzing at the ends, this stuff is soothing and smoothing!  </li>
<li> several highlight treatments to go dark brown to black so lots of dry and damaged hair..</li>

<li> I am using the milk for a couple of weeks now and my hair feel thicker, bouncy and surprisingly not oily.</li>
<li> I have thin hair</li>
<li> Thin like curly hair</li>
<li> I was not impressed at all by this product I will finish the bottle just because I don&#x27;t want to throw away my money</li>

    <li> Can&#x27;t tell any difference with my hair. Still super dry... The product smells good though, and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
    <li> This smells great . Makes my hair shine. Nice results. Will re- order</li>
    <li> Bought it because of an article in some magazine.  Didn&#x27;t think it will work on my hair.  Nothing works on my hair (that’s what I thought). I was really surprised. I have a short, fine, straight hair that lacks volume and shine (years of coloring).  I am using the milk for a couple of weeks now and my hair feel thicker, bouncy and surprisingly not oily.</li>
    <li> I  love this product...</li>
    <li> This was a really great smelling product and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out like most of the leave in conditioners-Good product...</li>
    <li> It is a very good product. I have thin hair and I feel that it somewhat weighs my hair down a bit.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  So easy to use for the results you get from the first time use.  Leaves your hair clean and soft to touch.  My hair is healthy and shines bright!</li>
    <li> Great stuff that makes your hair feel so soft!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Exactly what I ordered, no damage. Live this stuff</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a 10 was better for my hair. i have bleached dirty blonde hair.</li>
    <li> It not the greatest product or the worse product i have used. It not greasy in my hair and it smells great.Dont think it is actually doing anything for my hair.</li>
    <li> Very good product , makes my hair easy to comb thru</li>
    <li> Love the smell!  I have longer curly hair and this leaves hair soft (not sticky feeling like some leave-in conditioners).  The only complaint is the way the conditioner sprays out of the bottle.  Hoping that it&#x27;s just a glitch in my bottle and the next bottle I have sprays better.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> hard to spray/pump out, but good product</li>
    <li> This product smells soooo great! I saw great reviews for it on here and in a magazine article. Gave it a go, and I had to use so much of it at once for it to even slightly work. I was not impressed at all by this product I will finish the bottle just because I don&#x27;t want to throw away my money and I mean it does smell lovely.</li>
    <li> I needed something for over processed old hair and this fit the bill. Fast fast shippkng. Yummy smell.</li>
    <li> Really good for untangling hair and for frizz. Keeps hair looking less dry. I have blonde highlights, natural hair is brown..several highlight treatments to go dark brown to black so lots of dry and damaged hair..keeps it looking human this awesome leave in spray.</li>
    <li> Like the softness it created</li>
    <li> best leave in conditioner I have ever used!  Incredible difference in the way my hair feels and looks.</li>
    <li> Great product for your hair no frizz</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product that does not weigh the hair down, but adds shine, friz control &amp; beautiful body!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  My hair was dry and frizzing at the ends, this stuff is soothing and smoothing!  Not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> This is helping my overly processed hair.  So glad  I found it and gave it a try.</li>
    <li> Still getting the hang of using it, but basically like it.</li>
    <li> I got a sample from a popular cosmetic store and was instantly in love with Alterna Caviar products.  However, this leave in conditioner is hard to find, hence the purchase on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alterna Caviar products aren&#x27;t cheap, but the are wonderful hair care products - worth the money.</li>
    <li> UPDATED - After some serious humidity and then drying, I did notice not using the Caviar makes my hair really frizzy!!  Lesson learned, I need to apply the Caviar before blow drying to tame the frizzes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supposedly recommended by celebrities with nice hair.  I see no difference--guess you also need the personal hair stylist to go along with the product.......</li>
    <li> The best hands down.  Thin like curly hair and it makes it so full and soft.  I noticed after decades (I&#x27;m 45) that I was walking and noticed my hair bouncing ! Flowing and bouncing!! Ive never had hair like this.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AH-MAZING. It&#x27;s perfect for the warmer months when my hair tends to turn into straw. It leaves my hair feeling hydrated, soft, shiny and nourished. It&#x27;s a little misrepresented by the word &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; as it&#x27;s not a spray. It&#x27;s a pump that dispenses a cream. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s called a spray, but oh well. You also don&#x27;t need that much but even if you go a bit overboard it won&#x27;t make your hair weighed down or greasy. It&#x27;s also good to smooth a small amount over dry hair to tame flyaways and add a touch up of moisture. It smells just like all the other Alterna Caviar products, which I really like. It&#x27;s a nice clean smell, not floral or sweet.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a great product, great price and lasts awhile. Love it.</li>
    <li> I really like this Leave in. Not thrilled about the spray nozzle. It doesn&#x27;t disperse the product well enough. I just spray it into my hairs and work through it that way. It smells great, applies evenly, and keep my long hair from making me bananas while I brush, dry, and style it. I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love how it sinks in without leaving a greasy or heavy feeling to your hair. It is helping me keep the dry ends in check as I am going through the process of growing my hair longer. I also use this on my little girls hair to help prevent the tangles she gets from dry winter air.</li>
