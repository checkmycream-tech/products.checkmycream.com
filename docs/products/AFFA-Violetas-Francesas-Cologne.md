      <li>Brings back pleasant childhood memories.</li>
      <li>So refreshing and light, this is a beautiful fragrance with a delicate note of violet.</li>
      <li>a true scent of violets...</li>
      <li>as much as I do, and if I need to remove it because of someone else&#x27;s allergy or sensitivity, I think I will be able to address those problems.</li>
      <li>The cologne smelled like violets when I sniffed it from the bottle, but after I put it on, it faded quickly and almost immediately smelled like some sort of body powder--not at all like violets.</li>
      <li>fresh, luscious and flirty</li>

      <li>I really like this cologne.</li>
      <li>I did receive this (Violetas Francesas Cologne) and 3 stars is a very generous for me to give for this Made in USA product.</li>
      <li>This is such a clean smelling cologne my Cuban friend turned me on to.</li>
      <li>I could not take my Chanel on the airplane (airline regulations) and wanted something fresh and clean for the few days I was there.  </li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>Kind of weak and not all that violet smelling for me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;PS - it pours nicely in an old fashioned pump spray perfume atomizer - or in those refillable purse sticks.</li>
      <li>Used this for my kids when they were young.</li>

    <li> Used this for my kids when they were young. Now, I was able to buy it for my grandson. Smells great.</li>
    <li> Light, fresh and doesn&#x27;t last long, which is precisely what I wanted.  Not everyone loves it (or any fragrance, for that matter) as much as I do, and if I need to remove it because of someone else&#x27;s allergy or sensitivity, I think I will be able to address those problems.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this frangrance - it&#x27;s more of a splash, so you can put it on heavy on all the spots - inside of elbow, behind knees, etc. it does smell just like violets to me - and of course smells like baby powder and baby lotion because that&#x27;s the fragrance they use too! I only wish this was available in a strong perfume so it would last.......because it just doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a short-lived wonderful splash fragrance, light and floral and great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - it pours nicely in an old fashioned pump spray perfume atomizer - or in those refillable purse sticks. : - )</li>
    <li> A very pleasant fresh, clean, natural scent.  Great as a splash - on body or linens. Brings back pleasant childhood memories.</li>

    <li> I found this on a recent trip to Florida.  I could not take my Chanel on the airplane (airline regulations) and wanted something fresh and clean for the few days I was there.  This was such a pleasant surprise!  So refreshing and light, this is a beautiful fragrance with a delicate note of violet. Absolutely perfect.</li>
    <li> the scent is ok. Kind of weak and not all that violet smelling for me.</li>
    <li> I did receive this (Violetas Francesas Cologne) and 3 stars is a very generous for me to give for this Made in USA product. 2.5 star will be fair for it. This thing smell nothing like Violetas, Is a chip cologne for chip price. You get what you pay for. Do I recommend this product? Yes if you can&#x27;t afford anything better.</li>
