<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what you see. I got great colors and it&#x27;s what it says. I didn&#x27;t get any weird colors, so it&#x27;s very good for my daughter&#x27;s wardrobe.</li>
    <li> Looks great on my baby Girl. Although the clips scratched her a bit so I&#x27;m placing something soft between her head and the band.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time, and each headband looks great. We have no qualms with the quality of the product. I like that the flowers and bands are interchangeable. I just wish they had a brown color in group. My daughter has plenty of brown outfits, but no brown headband.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the headbands that have a clip I should have paid more attention I feel like they could hurt baby&#x27;s head They are cute but I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again</li>
    <li> This is an amazing price to get headbands in all these colors. The flowers detach nicely to be used on their own as well. The clips are good quality. My only disappointment was that I received 2 light pinks instead of the red, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain. Thank you!</li>
    <li> She was googoo over these for her soon-yo-be newborn daughter. Once she was born... she&#x27;s worn these headbands almost everyday. GREAT thing is that the flowers can come unattached so you can mix and match the headbands with different colored flowers or if you wanna buy any extra flowers to go with these, you can use the headbands that come with this package. Cool stuff!</li>
    <li> These flowers are WAY to big for a baby I even think to big for a toddler. They look cheap so I haven&#x27;t used them for my daughter. The plus side is all the flowers come on clips so you can use the head bands for something else!</li>
    <li> But other then that they cane the same colors was a bit disappointed was looking foward to switch the headbands around but cant since it cane glued right on the band</li>
    <li> I love this Dozen of assorted.. the color is the same in the picture.. thanks..  i&#x27;m thinking buy this again.. :)</li>
    <li> Beautiful headbands in twelve different colors. Love the daisy flower attached to each. A color to match every outfit we own!</li>
    <li> Love these head bows.  The shipping was much quicker than I expected and the bows are very pretty.  A few are the same colors, which is fine.  The bows are on clips, so they can come off and attach to different colored bands or other items.  Definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> I bought these headbands and flowers for my infant baby girl.  Her head circumference is 15cm and these fit perfectly.  The flower is big but I think it&#x27;s cute on her.  I mix and match the flowers and headbands and also have some bows too. Perfect for changing her everyday outfits into cutie pie outfits!</li>
    <li> Came in great condition, got every color like in the picture. Got them in the mail pretty fast,  can&#x27;t wait to put them on my baby girl!</li>
    <li> These were so cute. My kids love them because it is an easy, cute fix for their hair. The look much cuter when you get them and have lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to get purple, red, orange and green included. I received multiple different colors, but also 2 of each of the same color :( other than that, they are cute and fit my daughter. I would change my rating if I could receive the missing colors.</li>
    <li> The colors are vibrant and I like the fact that the flowers are glued in at the seam as oppose to being on some type of clip that could aggravate my daughter and nieces little heads. Ordered 2 sets.</li>
    <li> These are perfect!! We have one for every outfit!!  They are great for older girls too! You can remove the flower which is a great feature!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with all the color choices. I didn&#x27;t realize the flowers were permanently attached to the head band with glue.</li>
    <li> I ordered these since they said the flowers were on clips so I could switch out the bands with some other clips I have but the flowers are glued on :( Still super pretty and I may just pull the flowers off</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these headbands.  I was going to order them from an independent seller however her response time was less than adequate and then I found these.  I actually ordered 2 lots, one for my daughter who is 11 months and one for my neice who is 2 months.  These are great and they brighten up every outfit your baby wears!</li>
    <li> Love that you can remove flowers to interchange colors. Colors are beautiful. Great variety. You can not beat the price and shipping was free.</li>
    <li> Exactly what the picture shows. None of the flowers were even bent!! Can&#x27;t wait &#x27;til my baby girl comes so she can wear them. She&#x27;s got a flower for every outfit :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely a terrific deal...all great colors, no loose ends and perfect sizing that fit all three kids I got these for.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Good Transaction and good product.We just love our grandchild,a precious little girl.The headbands are so cute on her and assorted colors make it easier for dressing her in various outfits.Thanks</li>
    <li> I would give it five stars if it weren&#x27;t for one broken headband. The flowers are bigger than I thought. With dozen of different colors I can always find one that goes well with the clothes. It looks very cute on my little one&#x27;s head. The removable clips make it easy to wash the headbands. At this price I can&#x27;t expect more.</li>
    <li> The thinner headbands left indentation marks on our newborn&#x27;s head.  She has been wearing these comfortably from 2 months to now 6 months of age with a 75th percentile head circumference.  The flowers are removable clips, so I do not leave them on her unsupervised.  Having the clips for when she does outgrow the headbands will be handy.  We have not found an outfit that wouldn&#x27;t coordinate with one of these colors yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arrived in excellent condition in a padded envelope.</li>
    <li> These headbands are not what they say they are.  The flowers and glued on and stained.  I purchased them because they were suppose to be attached by a clip allowing you to mix and match.  They also said assorted colors, which I was fine with but I received 2 pinks, 2 reds, 2 blacks.  Identical, not different hues which I would have been okay with.  Plus one of them has a brown stain on it.  When I contacted the seller they asked me to send them a photo and then told me they would give me 2USD for my inconvenience.  They would not exchange them for the correct product.  They would not even admit to sending me the incorrect product.  Each correspondence got worse and worse.  The English was horrible; I left like I was talking to someone who did not even read (or understand) my emails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your not looking for a headband with removable clip flowers, then go for it.  But beware you may get all of the same color and they may be stained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horrible service!!</li>
    <li> I liked the colors and the amount for the price.  These will fit my granddaughter. grandniece and daughters of friends.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with these clips!  They are all really nice colors and the quality is Better than I though it might be.  I really like that the flower clips are removable so you can mix &amp; match flowers and bands or wear the flowers clipped directly into the hair.  Plus, They arrived on the first day of the 2 week window of expected delivery, which was a happy surprise.  I am so happy with the quality and value of these clips that I am going to order another set today to give as party favors at my daughters birthday party!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only tiny problem we have with these is that we didn&#x27;t receive a red flower/band, but instead got 2 light pinks in our set. I&#x27;m hoping the second set will have a red, and possibly an unpictured color like another reviewer mentioned. I&#x27;m still very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Nice colors and made well. I gave 4 stars because I didn&#x27;t receive every color pictured. Instead of the dark red, I received 2 light pinks. Also, shipping took a month, which was way too long.  Other than that, I am happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> thank you for a great product! They are beautiful and exactly as you said they would be. Thank you again!</li>
    <li> loved the flowers. great variety of colors. good for any age. my daughters and nieces loved receiving them as gifts.</li>
    <li> Just what I order!! Good quality, to match the fast service and delivery!! My new granddaughter will look extra cute now!! Thanks!</li>
    <li> The middle sparkly plastic falls off so easily and the band is way too small for any head. I think it only fits a doll.</li>
    <li> Crocheted headbands are perfect for baby girl!!!  They will stretch and grow with her... and the assortment of colors will match her endless wardrobe :)</li>
    <li> Love these! Perfect for the little dance girl in your life and the perfect price, definitely a must have. Thank you</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.! Good price for a lot of bowls.! Also you can use just the bowl without the string. We love it.!</li>
    <li> Great price, arrived on time and absolutely beautiful.  I was a little worried considering the price but could not be happier.  Would recommend</li>
    <li> Having my first girl after two boys. I was so happy to see that the flowers come off and I can add homemade flowers when I make my own! These are so cute too!</li>
    <li> Love them! My girls love them! They are so pretty and kinda cool cause you can take the clip off headband and just wear the clip. We liked them.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter who loves pink and purple.  I didn&#x27;t mind that there were other non-girly colors.  But we did not get any purples and only one pink.  Also no red or cream.  We also got colors that were not pictured, like a dark blue and dark brown.  We got two orange and two brown.  I know that there was a chance we won&#x27;t get the exact same colors as pictured, but I&#x27;m disappointed that my daughter didn&#x27;t get her favorite purple.</li>
    <li> The flowers are nice. The headbands are small, the size I would use for a baby, but they still fit my 4 yo daughter, so we like them. The clips are nice and are versatile. My daughter loves all the different colors.</li>
    <li> I just received my shipment, but it took way longer than it said it was going to. Not very happy</li>
    <li> You never know what you will end up with at such a low price (and free shipping from Hong Kong). I was QUITE pleased with them, but instead of the dark and light purple, I got two whites and two light pinks. That was a slight bummer, but again for the price......... can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> My girls and I have four of them love them! Great to take apart or wear them like they are! They r so simple but cute</li>
    <li> They were just as they looked and will make my granddaughter so happy! My other daughter liked them so much she ordered them too.</li>
    <li> These are the cutest flowers &amp; headbands &amp; not that expensive. My granddaughter wears them will all her outfits. My daughter mixes the flowers &amp; headband colors for all her outfits.</li>
    <li> I love this hairbands on my daughter .&lt;br /&gt;They match with every outfit she has .&lt;br /&gt;Low price for some great hairbands</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend the purchase of these hair bows.  They are absolutely adorable. Great price, and fantastic quality. They are great!</li>
    <li> I received the bows way before the estimated delivery was and they are so cute and perfect!!! I recommend it 100%! These are super cute for my newborn baby girl:)</li>
    <li> I got this set when I finally broke down and bought them for my daughter. I swore I&#x27;d never put a headband on her. It is a fantastic set. Looks adorable, incredible value, makes for a cute gift AND you can unattach the flower clip from the hairband and wear separately, so it grows with the baby. I totally recommend.</li>
    <li> Love the hair bands. Got two pink and no red but I have two girls so that wasn&#x27;t a big deal</li>
    <li> These are a great value! So excited to have a headband for almost every outfit. They came faster than expected too. These would make great gifts as well.</li>
    <li> Very cute and colorful! Love that the clips come off of the headband to wear the flower part alone or for mixing and matching. I have seen the headbands alone for $2.00 and up, so this is a great deal! I did receive 2 duplicate colors, but just thought I&#x27;d save them for a gift or an extra if one gets lost!</li>
    <li> Beautiful assorted colors. Can match with any of my daughter&#x27;s outfit.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love the hairbands, we separated the bow from the band and use the bows a lot. We loved the variety of colors, they are just what we were looking for and reasonably priced. Thank You!</li>
    <li> I have a 3 1/2 year old and a 5 month old and both can use the head bands. I receive the exact same colors as pictured and my daughter loved them. It comes with the headband and a flower clip attached, I love this because it gives me more options (you can mix and match or you can only use the clips or the head band or the HB with other clips or bows). Also they position the clip in a way that it won&#x27;t bother the baby and it won&#x27;t get tangled or pull a big girls hair. I make boutique bows and headbands and my daughters have very beautiful ones but I really think that you just can&#x27;t go wrong with this because: 1. It comes in every color. 2. They are basic girly headbands but with a big flower not the little flimsy ones they sell at the dollar store. 3 it has the beautiful accent in the middle (my daughter loves it) 4. It goes with any and every outfit.&lt;br /&gt;I love having this added to their headband collection, now I don&#x27;t have to worry If I don&#x27;t have a color that matches their outfits but have no time to make one. It took 3 weeks and 3 days to arrived at my house. Basic, girly and super cute! For the price it&#x27;s a must for every little girl.</li>
    <li> I was so amazed at the high quality of these flowers and bands. I LOVE the fact that the flowers can easily be unclipped from the band so you can wear it separately. I love all the colors and am so happy with these!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and a fraction of the price found elsewhere! So many colors that my daughter has a headband for every outfit.</li>
    <li> The material is exactly as described.  I received the package in perfect condition and earlier than I expected.  That being said I received every color except orange and the light purple. Instead I received a brown one which is gorgeous the crocheted part is a chocolate brown with silver running through it and two dark purple. This product would be five stars if all were different colors. I don&#x27;t plan on contacting the company for such a minor issue.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: These headbands are still great! My little one is now 19 months old and these still fit her and still look great. (April 24,2014)</li>
    <li> These crocheted baby headband are cute but they had a very chemical smelling odor to them which makes me question using them or not.  I&#x27;m hoping I can wash them, but worry that washing them will ruin the product.</li>
    <li> First off, I can&#x27;t believe how some people whine about the colors they get. They look at the photo &amp; don&#x27;t bother reading the description. You&#x27;re getting Assorted Colors/Mixed Color Lot. I have a prime account so I got a great price with free shipping. Also, when I ordered six dozen they gave me a bulk price. It took a little longer to receive, but I will definitely will be ordering more. I also have two friends that will be putting in bulk orders.</li>
    <li> Best deal I have found on these! Some duplicate colors but still a great buy! I would buy this again!</li>
    <li> Got two yellows instead of another color. Flower does not feel like good quality. Good price if don&#x27;t care what colors arrive.</li>
