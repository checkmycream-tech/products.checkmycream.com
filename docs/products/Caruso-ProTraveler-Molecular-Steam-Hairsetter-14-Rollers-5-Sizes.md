      <li>Wonderful curling straight hair.</li>
      <li>I have seen this product work great for a friend with more smooth hair.</li>
      <li>The steam works great to keep my very straight hair with some curve and bounce for most of the day.</li>
      <li>Just like I remember but better</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m done with awesome curls that last all day to show for it.</li>
      <li>this was ordered to replace a unit that had worked and is still working well  for more than 10 years; my wife has used it and likes</li>
      <li>I love these curlers.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to roll and set my hair in 10 minutes and it holds the curl for 2 days.</li>
      <li>love them.</li>
      <li>I get great and fast results with this product and carried it on vacation.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>This is probably my 6th set of these over many years.</li>
      <li>I love these.  </li>
      <li>My wife had used one for many, many years.</li>
      <li>Many thanks to Amazon for making this great product available.</li>
      <li>this is a good alternative to styling without too much damage and time.</li>
      <li>well and is  so easy to use.</li>
      <li>My life would not be quite so easy without these curlers.  </li>
      <li>its black, but that doesn&#x27;t make a difference still worked perfect.</li>
      <li>well here I am many many years later, and I have to say, I LOVE Caruso!</li>
      <li>Fabulous already wrote reveiw.</li>
      <li>I have tried many things to curl my very straight hair in the past and the Caruso molecular curler system is the best.</li>
      <li>packaging was ok, box was bent but the overall product inside was safe and sound.</li>
      <li>To be fair the written information for the product indicates there are only 14 rollers.  </li>
      <li>No matter what I did, I just didn&#x27;t get a good or lasting curl.</li>
      <li>she needed new rollers and thought it would be a good idea to replace the whole  thing.</li>
      <li>if you had real long hair , have given some as gifts as my friends loved mine</li>
      <li>Sexy soft waves without looking frumpy, and healthier than blow drying, flat ironing, then retouching the ends with a barrel brush and more heat!</li>
      <li>The 2 stars are only for the product; I was replacing one I finally wore out because it is a great curling system.</li>
      <li>If I want a straighter look than what the jumbo rollers give, I just tug the curls a bit while blowing hot air on them.</li>
      <li>If I used distilled water it may last longer but LOVE Caruso&#x27;s</li>
      <li>It heats up much more quickly than expected, yet doesn&#x27;t burn my fingers.</li>
      <li>I really like it, but the steam unit doesnt  lock.</li>
      <li>They tell me that you can use a hair dryer but that defeats the idea of being a gentle curler for your hair.  </li>
      <li>The clips held really well, though.</li>
      <li>and these are the only curlers that really curl my hair and the curls last for an entire day which is great.</li>
      <li>Wife bought these and she really likes them.  </li>
      <li>Clearly the company that I ordered this from should make sure that they are charging enough for shipping.</li>
      <li>I have been using similar sets for years with no damage to my long hair - quick and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Not only was the picture misleading, the box it was delivered in was for a different model with more curlers.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much I missed these old fashion steam rollers.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly, kinky, and frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>Can roll my just below shoulder length hair in less than five minutes and let cool while putting on makeup.</li>
      <li>What I wasn&#x27;t the happy about is that I had to wait a few days (due to the weather) to pick up this item at my post office due to insufficient postage.  </li>
      <li>When it finally stopped working, she asked me to order a new one asap...</li>
      <li>probably not going to go back to hot irons for as long as I can help it.</li>
      <li>It took me a few times to get the rods in right.</li>

<li> I have thin flyaway hair, but the Caruso makes my hair look full &amp; bouncy.</li>
<li> The actual product was black and there was only 14 rollers.  </li>
<li> I know women who spend an hour with a curling iron, and other hair implements, ten minutes</li>
<li> However, the curlers got damp and didn&#x27;t dry.</li>
<li> I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a hairsetter, doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair like a curling iron does.</li>
<li> As another reviewer mentioned, they were an odd collection in an open bag as if some had been removed or were collected from returns.  </li>
<li> but it was short another $5 and some odd cents</li>
<li> The rollers get very wet and the hair takes hours to dry.  </li>
<li> As compared to the Vidal Sassoon one I had before, I noticed that the foam on the Caruso rollers breaks down quicker than the Vidal Sassoon.</li>
<li> To guard the ends of my hair, I wrap them in a small piece of single layer Kleenex just before rolling up.</li>
<li> sets your hair in less that 15 to 20 minutes lots of curls  </li>
<li> I have curly hair and no matter how I rolled it my hair looked a mess.</li>
<li> my hair is a little less than shoulder length  </li>
<li> I had trouble using the rollers, and asked her advice.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t tell you the compliments I&#x27;ve gotten over the past two weeks that I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
<li> None were included in this set or with the additional rollers I ordered (6 medium and 6 small packs).  </li>
<li> It was a little awkward putting each one on the heater individually, but I could work with that.</li>
<li> It appears the seller has repackaged the rollers since instead of a sealed bag (as I received in previous orders) there was a thin plastic bag that had been tied.&lt;br</li>
<li> I have shoulder length layered thick hair.  </li>
<li> We have very hard water</li>
<li> I have very thick hair</li>
<li> And now that I&#x27;m 50, it&#x27;s also thin.</li>
<li> I am a bit disappointed because I had hoped they would hold the cheek a lot longer than a few hours.</li>
<li> I had read the reviews on this before I purchased as I thought they were a bit expensive.</li>

    <li> always good have used them for over 35 yrs . sets your hair in less that 15 to 20 minutes lots of curls  my hair is a little less than shoulder length  no idea if you had real long hair , have given some as gifts as my friends loved mine</li>
    <li> I have tried many things to curl my very straight hair in the past and the Caruso molecular curler system is the best. I can&#x27;t tell you the compliments I&#x27;ve gotten over the past two weeks that I&#x27;ve used it.  I will never use anything else. Many thanks to Amazon for making this great product available.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser suggested I order this set.  I had trouble using the rollers, and asked her advice.  She told me I should have received a comb clip for each roller.  None were included in this set or with the additional rollers I ordered (6 medium and 6 small packs).  Please send these to me.  Jane Fossum</li>
    <li> Just like I remember but better</li>
    <li> In perfect condition and works great thanks!</li>
    <li> My life would not be quite so easy without these curlers.  I know women who spend an hour with a curling iron, and other hair implements, ten minutes and I&#x27;m done with awesome curls that last all day to show for it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much I missed these old fashion steam rollers. probably not going to go back to hot irons for as long as I can help it. this is a good alternative to styling without too much damage and time. love them. packaging was ok, box was bent but the overall product inside was safe and sound. :) also it is not white like the picture. its black, but that doesn&#x27;t make a difference still worked perfect.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and no matter how I rolled it my hair looked a mess. I have seen this product work great for a friend with more smooth hair.</li>
    <li> The steam works great to keep my very straight hair with some curve and bounce for most of the day.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and as always its great .&lt;br /&gt;works well and is  so easy to use. and packs well for trips</li>
    <li> I found these rollers cumbersome to use. It was a little awkward putting each one on the heater individually, but I could work with that. However, the curlers got damp and didn&#x27;t dry. I tried using a hair dryer, but that didn&#x27;t help. I tried different lengths of times, etc. No matter what I did, I just didn&#x27;t get a good or lasting curl. The clips held really well, though. This is now in a box for the Thrift Shop.</li>
    <li> Wife bought these and she really likes them.  She says the steam roller does a great job.</li>
    <li> As compared to the Vidal Sassoon one I had before, I noticed that the foam on the Caruso rollers breaks down quicker than the Vidal Sassoon. Is there any way to just replace the foam on the rollers? Someone should think about that. Otherwise I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This is probably my 6th set of these over many years. I have very thick hair and these are the only curlers that really curl my hair and the curls last for an entire day which is great. We have very hard water and it may be the reason that they don&#x27;t last as long as they should. If I used distilled water it may last longer but LOVE Caruso&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I love these.  I have had several sets and wear them out.</li>
    <li> It took me a few times to get the rods in right. I really like it, but the steam unit doesnt  lock. The water could spill &amp; burn the skin!</li>
    <li> This was just a replacement so I was already very happy with this product.  What I wasn&#x27;t the happy about is that I had to wait a few days (due to the weather) to pick up this item at my post office due to insufficient postage.  I had paid the approx. $5 for postage when ordering but it was short another $5 and some odd cents so it could not be delivered.  Clearly the company that I ordered this from should make sure that they are charging enough for shipping.</li>
    <li> I had read the reviews on this before I purchased as I thought they were a bit expensive. I am a bit disappointed because I had hoped they would hold the cheek a lot longer than a few hours.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly, kinky, and frizzy hair. And now that I&#x27;m 50, it&#x27;s also thin. I get great and fast results with this product and carried it on vacation. It heats up much more quickly than expected, yet doesn&#x27;t burn my fingers. To guard the ends of my hair, I wrap them in a small piece of single layer Kleenex just before rolling up. Can roll my just below shoulder length hair in less than five minutes and let cool while putting on makeup. If I want a straighter look than what the jumbo rollers give, I just tug the curls a bit while blowing hot air on them. Sexy soft waves without looking frumpy, and healthier than blow drying, flat ironing, then retouching the ends with a barrel brush and more heat!</li>
    <li> I have short hair. The curler size was not a problem. For the price a very nice product.</li>
    <li> Not only was the picture misleading, the box it was delivered in was for a different model with more curlers. This brings me to the conclusion that whoever sells these puts all the returns together and repackages them.</li>
    <li> This is a disaster.  The rollers get very wet and the hair takes hours to dry.  They tell me that you can use a hair dryer but that defeats the idea of being a gentle curler for your hair.  I tried to return and they refused.  Amazon should not carry this item.</li>
    <li> Fabulous already wrote reveiw.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length layered thick hair.  I&#x27;m able to roll and set my hair in 10 minutes and it holds the curl for 2 days. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> I love these curlers.  I have been using similar sets for years with no damage to my long hair - quick and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I ordered a steam hairsetter with 30 curlers.  I was sent the box ordered with only 16 rollers.  As another reviewer mentioned, they were an odd collection in an open bag as if some had been removed or were collected from returns.  When I returned the description and photo had been changed to a 14 roller set that also did not match what was sent (the steamer or the sizes of rollers).  This seller is playing games and not honoring the product listed.  When I contacted the seller they insisted I received what I ordered.  The 2 stars are only for the product; I was replacing one I finally wore out because it is a great curling system.</li>
    <li> this was ordered to replace a unit that had worked and is still working well  for more than 10 years; my wife has used it and likes it&#x27;s simple operation she needed new rollers and thought it would be a good idea to replace the whole  thing.</li>
    <li> As another poster pointed out the picture of the product shown on Amazon is misleading.  The box shows a red \\&quot;professional\\&quot; steam pot with 30 rollers.  The actual product was black and there was only 14 rollers.  The picture is of the \\&quot;professional\\&quot; version of the product.  The product received was not the \\&quot;professional\\&quot; version.  To be fair the written information for the product indicates there are only 14 rollers.  It appears the seller has repackaged the rollers since instead of a sealed bag (as I received in previous orders) there was a thin plastic bag that had been tied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller should make it clearer that the product shown on the web site is not the same product that is being shipped.</li>
    <li> I never purchased this for myself, my sister gave me a Caruso Hairsetter.  It was a gift so I tried it,  well here I am many many years later, and I have to say, I LOVE Caruso! I have thin flyaway hair, but the Caruso makes my hair look full &amp; bouncy. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a hairsetter, doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair like a curling iron does. I am on my 3rd Caruso hairsetter!</li>
    <li> Did not work on my hair at all.  Need to return.</li>
    <li> Great product and great service from the company! Altima Beauty has my business! You will never need a curling iron again.</li>
    <li> My wife had used one for many, many years. When it finally stopped working, she asked me to order a new one asap...she just could not go on without her Caruso Hairsetter.</li>
    <li> Wonderful curling straight hair. With hairspray holds all day. I have used for over 15 yrs</li>
