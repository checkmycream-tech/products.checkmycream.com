      <li>I thought I was buying something that would be good for a camping trip since we would be doing very primitive camping (meaning no running water.)  </li>

      <li>I use this in between and still feel clean.</li>
      <li>Gets my bed-bound husband clean and saves a lot of time.  </li>
      <li>but it can become cloyingly sweet.  </li>

      <li>and you can do an adequate cleaning.</li>
      <li>Super product.  </li>
      <li>I love this wash for quick sponge baths when I have no time for a complete shower.</li>
      <li>It started me on the road to getting healthy and so far I have lost 30 lbs in 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I read the directions though, and it says right off to dilute solution in a couple gallons of water.</li>
      <li>Great product if you are not able to bath , from health problems.</li>
      <li>Because other users suggested that this is a good product for freshening up -- even after working out -- I happily assumed that it could be used with very little water if necessary.  </li>
      <li>Not only does it make you feel fresh and clean when you can&#x27;t bathe</li>
      <li>It has a strong soap smell that dissipates in a short time after use.  </li>
      <li>No rinse will wash the whole body removing dirt, grime and funky smells.  </li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>It is gentle to his skin.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really foam, but I make sure to get my skin wet.</li>
      <li>However, when this stuff is your only way of conveniently keeping clean, it&#x27;s a life-saver.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend for any age.</li>
      <li>The directions instruct the user to dilute the product with water, wash yourself, and then &amp;#34;Rinse in the normal manner.&amp;#34;  Since the instructions are two sentences, and one of them explains the need to rinse, I was misled by the title &amp;#34;No Rinse.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>You can also mix a small amount in about 1-4 oz of water for a wetter more solvent sponge bath.</li>
      <li>Keeping in mind more people are taken out by disease due to poor field hygiene than accident or injury, No Rinse will help keep you clean and healthy with very little effort or water.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It does have a slight &#x27;baby powder&#x27; scent, but it&#x27;s not heavy, and it fades pretty fast.</li>
      <li>The odor is subtle but refreshing.  </li>
      <li>Having a full time job and little kids, I didn&#x27;t have another time to exercise.</li>
      <li>Not only does it use little water one quart but leaves you feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
      <li>but if you wet a wash cloth a pour some on when you can finally shower you can make a short shower because you can quickly rinse off and not worry about soap itch or dryness if you didn&#x27;t get it all off.</li>
      <li>This left me feeling clean and refreshed with a lot less than the 1oz suggested!</li>
      <li>I thought this item could be used directly out of the bottle, like similar products for hunters.</li>
      <li>Long distance hikers live with a lot of stink factor.</li>
      <li>If you are a gram counter 2 oz of this will last a couple of weeks with daily use depending on how much you need to feel clean at the end of a long hard hike.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> There is no shower at my work. So working out during my lunch hour was not a possibility. Having a full time job and little kids, I didn&#x27;t have another time to exercise. After lots of research, I found this product. This product pulled me over the hump to start a regular workout routine during my lunch hour. It started me on the road to getting healthy and so far I have lost 30 lbs in 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my lunch-run, I lock my office door and get nakkid. I have the body bath diluted in a water bottle and squirt some of the dilution on a wash cloth and wipe it all over my body to get the sweat off. It doesn&#x27;t really foam, but I make sure to get my skin wet. The odor is subtle but refreshing.  Usually it dries up before I am done putting it on, but I do go over it with a dry towel to wipe any excess off. I feel clean for the rest of the afternoon until I can take a shower at home at night. I also use the no-rinse shampoo for my hair.</li>
    <li> Smells good, Cleans well, not harsh on skin ~ would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful and I&#x27;m glad I found it for my 93 year old mom who is extremely reluctant to get in a bathtub.  With this product it is not a factor and I can keep her smelling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I use this as we are in process of remodeling our bathroom. Not only does it use little water one quart but leaves you feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Repeat purchase -- product great as ever.</li>
    <li> I love this wash for quick sponge baths when I have no time for a complete shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three years. Initially, it was purchased because of a major surgery that makes bathing difficult, if not impossible. This product is wonderful. I continue to buy it regularly.</li>
    <li> We are in a bad drought here in California.  So I take showers only every three day.  I use this in between and still feel clean.</li>
    <li> I thought this item could be used directly out of the bottle, like similar products for hunters. Had no idea this is meant to be diluted before using. I thought I was buying something that would be good for a camping trip since we would be doing very primitive camping (meaning no running water.)  I read the directions though, and it says right off to dilute solution in a couple gallons of water. Not feasible at a primitive camp site! Did not end up using it.</li>
    <li> Because other users suggested that this is a good product for freshening up -- even after working out -- I happily assumed that it could be used with very little water if necessary.  Not so!  I tried it, stepped outside in the 90 degree, 80% humidity of NYC in August and my skin felt as if it were coated in a thin, slimy film - which I don&#x27;t remember any of the other reviewers mentioning.  By the time I got back to work, I was drenched in sticky sweat; worse even than if I had used just plain soap and water.  Urgh... Wonder if it only needs a proper rinse when it&#x27;s humid out?</li>
    <li> this is a great product, I. love it, i use it several timees a day.</li>
    <li> The directions instruct the user to dilute the product with water, wash yourself, and then &amp;#34;Rinse in the normal manner.&amp;#34;  Since the instructions are two sentences, and one of them explains the need to rinse, I was misled by the title &amp;#34;No Rinse.&amp;#34;  It is simply false.</li>
    <li> We have been using this for sponge baths. It produces no irritation, and has a very fresh scent. You add one ounce to each bath, so each bottle holds 16 baths. I like the aloe vesta for showers, but this mixes better in water for a sponge bath.</li>
    <li> Great product if you are not able to bath , from health problems. It works good.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my mother when she was in my care. Very refreshing and nice scent.Easy to use because you don&#x27;t have to rinse. Use it myself in between showers and love it! Highly recommend for any age.</li>
    <li> Another surgery another need for this. Not only does it make you feel fresh and clean when you can&#x27;t bathe but if you wet a wash cloth a pour some on when you can finally shower you can make a short shower because you can quickly rinse off and not worry about soap itch or dryness if you didn&#x27;t get it all off. Perfect for those of us who can&#x27;t stand very well yet. Very nice clean scent too!</li>
    <li> I had plumbing issues and did not have reliable access to a shower for a while.  This stuff worked great, however the smell gets to be a little sickening after a while (especially after a few days of using it twice a day).  It&#x27;s a nice fragrance but it can become cloyingly sweet.  However, when this stuff is your only way of conveniently keeping clean, it&#x27;s a life-saver.  The good thing is after you&#x27;ve used it, the smell does fade away within an hour or two.</li>
    <li> Super product.  The same stuff as used in hospitals.  Very clean scent and cleans well!  Great when soaking feet...Gets them clean and refreshe!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Gets my bed-bound husband clean and saves a lot of time.  It is gentle to his skin.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend when he was in the hospital and it worked much better then we both expected. I would definitely buy again if we needed it but hopefully we won&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> It leaves me feeling as refreshed as I do after a shower.</li>
    <li> We rally like it. works well.</li>
    <li> Like the item states, it does not require any rinsing. works well</li>
    <li> Excellent product , i use it for my mother, she is bedridden, it has a clean scent, it keeps her always very clean.</li>
    <li> This left me feeling clean and refreshed with a lot less than the 1oz suggested! I sprayed some on a warm damp washcloth and it was the perfect amount!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a slight &#x27;baby powder&#x27; scent, but it&#x27;s not heavy, and it fades pretty fast.</li>
    <li> Great xstuff. Works good.</li>
    <li> When I cannot shower this is a life saver.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, gentle &amp; cleansing, I use it daily as needed. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> It takes very little of the No Rinse to make a no rinse bath for hiking where bathing is problematic. A damp cloth and a little No rinse will wash the whole body removing dirt, grime and funky smells.  It has a strong soap smell that dissipates in a short time after use.  You can also mix a small amount in about 1-4 oz of water for a wetter more solvent sponge bath. Perfect for use in the sleeping bag if you need privacy while camping. If you are a gram counter 2 oz of this will last a couple of weeks with daily use depending on how much you need to feel clean at the end of a long hard hike. Long distance hikers live with a lot of stink factor. Keeping in mind more people are taken out by disease due to poor field hygiene than accident or injury, No Rinse will help keep you clean and healthy with very little effort or water.  All you need is a small cloth, a dime sized amount of No Rinse, and an ounce of water to wet the cloth and you can do an adequate cleaning.</li>
