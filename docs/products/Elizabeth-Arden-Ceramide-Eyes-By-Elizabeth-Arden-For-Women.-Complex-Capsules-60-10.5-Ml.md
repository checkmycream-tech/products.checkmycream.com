<ol>
    <li> Excelente producto! Una sola capsula sirve para varias aplicaciones y ya estoy viendo los resultados en el contorno de mis ojos.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream since it came out, excellent product, I&#x27;m 61 &amp; mo one believes it!</li>
    <li> cheap is the first.no box,why? is it really?only use by yourself ,no to be a gifts. it is a pity.</li>
    <li> These eye ceramides are the greatest! I have been using them daily for about 30 years along with Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s face Time Complex capsules after they were recommended to me by a skin specialist. The products really help minimize and smooth the fine lines and wrinkles and add moisture especially if your skin tends to be dry like mine. They have actually preserved my skin texture giving it a more youthful appearance. After cleansing, I mist with toner spray and then apply the eye serum ceramides all around my eyes including the crow&#x27;s feet at the corners, but not too close to the lashes. Then I use my eye moisturizer before applying concealer and eye shadow daytime or my night eye moisturizer. On the face I follow the same process with the Time Complex capsules before applying makeup or night moisturizer before bedtime. I am in my 60&#x27;s and people often say, \\&quot;You don&#x27;t have any wrinkles!\\&quot; Well I do but the lines are so much softer. The ceramides coupled with the other routine care I take make me look much younger than I am. I&#x27;ve passed on my \\&quot;secret\\&quot; of the Elizabeth Arden ceramides to many women and always get positive feedback about their results too. Amazon&#x27;s prices for this product are amazing compared with the department and discount stores.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the first product. I got the second one ELIZABETH ARDEN by Elizabeth Arden: Elizabeth Arden Ceramide Eyes Time Complex Capsules--60caps .Why ? I ordered both. Susan</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It moisturizes without being greasy, and doesn&#x27;t cause any eye irritation.  For someone whose eyes are easily irritated, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> It goes on kinda oily, then disappears.  I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Her eye care products moisturize the area well without irritation. I&#x27;ve had that problem with some eye creams. This oil is great. Gives me extra moisture for fall and upcoming drier colder weather. Was concerned after reading some reviews about capsule condition. These were great; came in the plastic casing undisturbed and not dried out or opened. Use the extra oil per capsule for hands and cuticles. One capsule contains a lot.</li>
    <li> During winter time, it&#x27;s dry everywhere after we use heater. After use this excellent product, I feel so good and so comfortable.</li>
    <li> This is the only eye product I can use that does not cause eye swelling in the morning.  It is absorbed by my skin in seconds and leaves  a smooth look.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the first time and I am extremely happy with the results. I can definitely tell a difference around my eyes, almost like I&#x27;ve had botox! I rub it in around both eyes and there is usually a bit left over which I blend in with my moisturizer. My skin is appears much smoother and brighter. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> The oil in these capsules has a rancid odor.  I wonder if they are out of date.  They probably are since I got them at such a bargain.  It&#x27;s too soon to tell if they will be effective on the eye area.</li>
    <li> Fine lines are disappearing.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is silky and my skin soaks it up quickly, without leaving an oily mess. However,when I ordered this product this time, it must have been exposed to heat. All of the capsules were stuck together, and the product is not working well now like it normally does.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, keep store on a dry cool place. I love the way my skin looks now.  It diminishes the lines and absorbs quickly on skin. Nice scent. I recommend this product/seller strongly :)</li>
    <li> very good deal and super soft skin</li>
    <li> I used to use this stuff years ago. I was not able to find it at the stores I shopped at, so I stopped using it. These eye capsules work well. Just be careful that it does not run in your eyes. I also use some around my mouth area too.</li>
    <li> I have no idea if this product is any good for my skin or not.</li>
    <li> Apply every morning and evening. It has made a big difference especially with the crows feet. So well worth it!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cindy Lou</li>
    <li> I have bought for my mom, since her she wants to soft the skins around eyes. And this works, not too creamy even for the night use. My mom likes it.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, fully satisfied, the product was what I expected, I received exactly what I expected, i highly recommend, the product was received as was described.</li>
    <li> I love these capsules- they moisturize my eyes beautifully, minimize my under eye circles, and make my under eye concealor go on so smoothly.  I will never stop using them.</li>
    <li> I have used this ceramide oil before (bought from a store) and it worked wonderful. This oil works great as a moisturizing oil. However, I don&#x27;t like this one I got here, it has a strong smell that is somehow like fuel. The price here is great but I wont purchase again, I cant stand the smell of this oil.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years with much success, however, this recent order is old (no expiration date). I could barely snip off the tip as the plastic is hard as a rock.  I can&#x27;t even squeeze the oil out as the plastic as it is NOT pliable at all.  The price was very low which made me order this ... so as the old saying goes; you get what you pay for.  Very disappointed!</li>
