      <li>Beautiful.</li>
      <li>But very cute!</li>
      <li>Great shade.</li>
      <li>It is great for adding sparkle to a color.  </li>
      <li>It looks great over every color.  </li>
      <li>Looked amazing!</li>
      <li>The color is beautiful by itself or as a glittery top coat.</li>
      <li>The color is beautiful by itself or as a glittery top coat.</li>
      <li>This is a great top color.  </li>
      <li>My babe is my favorite color from the ibd just gel polish!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good glitter but not my favorite basics on this one.</li>
      <li>This is a nice sparkle which looks good on it&#x27;s own or on top of color.  </li>
      <li>On its own it can be built to almost opaque in about three coats, (you still see some visible nail line).</li>
      <li>This is a nice dense glitter.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a very thick glitter, but perfect for layering.</li>
      <li>I used this one with Amethyst Surprise or one of my many reds and it gives it a nice sparkle to the nail.  </li>
      <li>I still love the gel polish and since this brand is more affordable you can buy more colors and change more often to make up for wear time if doing your own nails as I do.</li>
      <li>Very interesting and unique color.</li>
      <li>It is mostly silver but has some rainbow going on.</li>
      <li>It is a medium glittery polish- not over the top.</li>
      <li>You can wear this color on top of any of your favorite IBD Gel Polishes.  </li>
      <li>so we don&#x27;t have to use so many layers of this.</li>
      <li>which it was but in my opinion, it was more silver than purple.</li>
      <li>Goes on well, cures well, however, I used 4 or more coats &amp; it doesn&#x27;t look like the swatch.</li>
      <li>I have layered it over IBDs Amethyst Surprise and love both of them more together than separate.</li>
      <li>Love it...</li>
      <li>Love.</li>
      <li>More coats, more glitter</li>
      <li>I just ordered 3 more colors.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this polish.  </li>
      <li>I totally love this color.</li>
      <li>I am in love.</li>
      <li>This is a lot of glitter, more than I was expecting.</li>
      <li>Stunning amount of of glitter.</li>
      <li>just gel, my favorite gel polish (better than Gelish in coverage, durability and price).&lt;br /&gt;Ibd covers in one coat, prefect coverage with 2.&lt;br /&gt;Cures in LED or UV light.</li>
      <li>The IBD gels seem to stay on better than Gelish (IMHO) and they go on smooth, cure well, and don&#x27;t chip.</li>
      <li>I put it over the top of a light mocha.</li>
      <li>It is buildable, so if you don&#x27;t want a lot of sparkles you can easily accomplish this.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use Gel Polish.  </li>
      <li>It is great for art, for accents and for the entire nail to make a statement.</li>
      <li>it will run over my fingers while under the LED light.</li>
      <li>I consider it a light to medium purple shade when I have used 2 coats by itself.</li>
      <li>I get long wear, smooth applications and beautiful colors.</li>
      <li>Gorgeous pinky tiny glitter by itself, OR can top layer purples, blacks, etc.</li>
      <li>Its so pretty!!</li>
      <li>It does take a few coats though to get some good coverage might work better as a top coat</li>
      <li>I love it so much</li>
      <li>Had to use many layers to see much</li>
      <li>but I have to apply 3-4 coats to get a good solid sparkle.</li>
      <li>Its so pretty and sparkly!</li>
      <li>Definitely needs to be layered on top of an actual color, but it&#x27;s really nice!</li>
      <li>It cures super fast with the Sensationail led light.</li>
      <li>Also nice big bottle.</li>
      <li>The first nail I apply it on is super sparkly(I assume because sparkles have thickened on the brush over time)</li>
      <li>It also dries under a UV light much quicker than any other color I own, which makes it easy when I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of time to do my nails.</li>
      <li>I do still really like it because of the amount of sparkle and it looks good over other colors.</li>
      <li>This color is so pretty.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a sheer shimmery top coat @</li>
      <li>but it was pretty.</li>
      <li>I decided to give this brand a try since gelish is so expensive and man am I happy!!</li>
      <li>Its so pretty and sparkly</li>
      <li>I really like it!</li>
      <li>Also love the bottle size, it is twice as big as CND.</li>
      <li>it includes enough glider and able to finish only 2 coat + top coat.  </li>
      <li>Light amethyst dust in clear suspension gel.</li>
      <li>Two cots would probably suffice on it&#x27;s own, although I got it to put over other colors.</li>
      <li>great accent 1 coat over other color - or multiple coats alone.</li>
      <li>Just be warned if you opt for this polish for your whole nails, and not just the tips, it will probably take 3 to 4 coats.</li>
      <li>I really like this polish.  </li>
      <li>It does not have much coverage and would need to be applied over another color.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfectly pigmented and only use 2 thin coats.</li>
      <li>The glitter is large, so it is not subtle.</li>
      <li>and they always request this as their top coat to go over other colors to give them sparkles.</li>
      <li>I can use it to put on top of different colors to give them a different look.  </li>
      <li>Aphrodite is a lovely lilac glitter, a little on the gray tone of purple, with a silver sparkle undertone.</li>
      <li>I thought this was going to be a clear polish with purple glitter</li>
      <li>especially because the high revie</li>
      <li>The sparkles are super small &amp; all the same size.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very happy, just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> I totally love this color. Some sparkle yet understated. Almost platinum looking. Also love the bottle size, it is twice as big as CND.</li>
    <li> This is a nice sparkle which looks good on it&#x27;s own or on top of color.  Applied w/ 2 coats only (w/o color), the polish lasted 3+weeks!  The sparkles are super small &amp; all the same size.  It is mostly silver but has some rainbow going on.</li>
    <li> Great shade. Just be warned if you opt for this polish for your whole nails, and not just the tips, it will probably take 3 to 4 coats.</li>
    <li> I really like this polish.  It is great for adding sparkle to a color.  I used it a lot to sprakle my ring finger.  It looks great over every color.  The glitter is large, so it is not subtle.</li>
    <li> This color didn&#x27;t turn out how I expected it, I was hoping for a color similar to the bottle. It is actually like a grayish clear base with sparkle in it. I do still really like it because of the amount of sparkle and it looks good over other colors.</li>
    <li> Definitely needs to be layered on top of an actual color, but it&#x27;s really nice!</li>
    <li> This is a great top color.  You can wear this color on top of any of your favorite IBD Gel Polishes.  I used this one with Amethyst Surprise or one of my many reds and it gives it a nice sparkle to the nail.  It is buildable, so if you don&#x27;t want a lot of sparkles you can easily accomplish this.  The sparkles are very small as well, which I appreciate.</li>
    <li> Silver sparkles throughout. People often ask me if I got my nails done when I have this color on. It also dries under a UV light much quicker than any other color I own, which makes it easy when I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of time to do my nails.</li>
    <li> This color is so pretty. Had to use many layers to see much but it was pretty. I recently bought a purple simular to this color to have as a base coat so we don&#x27;t have to use so many layers of this. But very cute!</li>
    <li> This is a nice dense glitter. Lavender-gray. Very interesting and unique color. Two cots would probably suffice on it&#x27;s own, although I got it to put over other colors. Plenty of sparkle.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good glitter but not my favorite basics on this one.</li>
    <li> The glitter is almost silver gray with a few hints of purple.  It does not have much coverage and would need to be applied over another color.  Also the glitter is so small, it doesn&#x27;t really have any sparkle to it at all.</li>
    <li> Basic sparkle. Would not return but would not buy again.</li>
    <li> My babe is my favorite color from the ibd just gel polish! It&#x27;s perfectly pigmented and only use 2 thin coats. I am in love. I posted a picture so everyone can see how perfect it is.</li>
    <li> I adore this!! Gorgeous pinky tiny glitter by itself, OR can top layer purples, blacks, etc. Stunning amount of of glitter. I will buy this again!!</li>
    <li> I put it over the top of a light mocha. Looked amazing! It has hints of purple flake in it. I really like it!</li>
    <li> Its so pretty and sparkly! Its a grey/silver/blue color! Its so pretty!! It does take a few coats though to get some good coverage might work better as a top coat</li>
    <li> The color is beautiful by itself or as a glittery top coat. I love it. Its so pretty and sparkly</li>
    <li> Easy to use Gel Polish.  it includes enough glider and able to finish only 2 coat + top coat.  This can save my time.</li>
    <li> Light amethyst dust in clear suspension gel. great accent 1 coat over other color - or multiple coats alone. More coats, more glitter dusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ibd just gel, my favorite gel polish (better than Gelish in coverage, durability and price).&lt;br /&gt;Ibd covers in one coat, prefect coverage with 2.&lt;br /&gt;Cures in LED or UV light.</li>
    <li> This compliments my other Gelish colors when I layer it over them. It is a medium glittery polish- not over the top. I consider it a light to medium purple shade when I have used 2 coats by itself. I know it is very hard to determine colors online so I hope this helps you.</li>
    <li> I love this polish.  I can use it to put on top of different colors to give them a different look.  Also nice big bottle.</li>
    <li> The brush fell off after apply 3 strokes.  I was looking forward to the polish, especially because the high revie</li>
    <li> Love it... Just wish it was sparklier. The first nail I apply it on is super sparkly(I assume because sparkles have thickened on the brush over time) but I have to apply 3-4 coats to get a good solid sparkle. Have to be very careful to not apply it too thickly or else it will run over my fingers while under the LED light.</li>
    <li> Beautiful. Purple base with silver glitter. Love.</li>
    <li> I gave it a 3 rating because it does not wear as long as the gelish brand. I still love the gel polish and since this brand is more affordable you can buy more colors and change more often to make up for wear time if doing your own nails as I do.</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be a clear polish with purple glitter which it was but in my opinion, it was more silver than purple.</li>
    <li> Goes on well, cures well, however, I used 4 or more coats &amp; it doesn&#x27;t look like the swatch. It&#x27;s a sheer shimmery top coat @ best.</li>
    <li> Stays on as well a Gelish brands. I will save money by buying this brand from now on.  Actually soaked off easier.</li>
    <li> This color just sparkles like crazy, I love to put one coat of black and then one coat of this color for a different look.  The IBD gels seem to stay on better than Gelish (IMHO) and they go on smooth, cure well, and don&#x27;t chip. Love it!</li>
    <li> I decided to give this brand a try since gelish is so expensive and man am I happy!! It cures super fast with the Sensationail led light. The color is beautiful by itself or as a glittery top coat. I love it so much I just ordered 3 more colors.</li>
    <li> As always IBD remains an affordable, quality gel polish option. I get long wear, smooth applications and beautiful colors. Aphrodite is a lovely lilac glitter, a little on the gray tone of purple, with a silver sparkle undertone. It&#x27;s not a very thick glitter, but perfect for layering. On its own it can be built to almost opaque in about three coats, (you still see some visible nail line). I have layered it over IBDs Amethyst Surprise and love both of them more together than separate.</li>
    <li> This is a see though sliver/purple glitter color. I often do my nieces nails and they always request this as their top coat to go over other colors to give them sparkles.</li>
    <li> This is a lot of glitter, more than I was expecting. It is great for art, for accents and for the entire nail to make a statement.</li>
