      <li>Thanks, Cricket.</li>
      <li>I have purchased many other brushes over the years and they are still like new...</li>

      <li>but instead I got blue completely different brushes that I had to send back and spend more money.  </li>
      <li>I have two large ones at home, and a smaller one in my purse.</li>
      <li>because I would use them once and go back to my Fast Flo.  </li>
      <li>I really like this little brush.  </li>

<li> Small enough for my purse to carry.</li>
<li> Not too big or small.  </li>

<li> I had one previously and it had a rubber sleeve on it.  </li>
<li> for the past year and a half, with no problems.</li>
<li> big sloppy kisses to Amazon!</li>

    <li> This brush is anti static like it states and it fits in my purse perfectly!!  Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this Mini and the original sized version ([[ASIN:B0002Z8OL0 Cricket Fast Flo Static Free]]) for the past year and a half, with no problems. It&#x27;s a very good brush, very well constructed, with a comfortable rubberized grip. Not the biggest fan of red, but hey, it&#x27;s a brush. The smaller size makes it perfect for purses and vehicle consoles/glove compartments. I recently gave the Mini to my daughter as it is the only vent brush that she will use, since the others tend to hurt and tear out bits of her very long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve kept the larger version in my headset drawer at work, and while all my other brushes have had massive static problems from being in that drawer, the Cricket Fast Flo Static Free does the trick.</li>
    <li> Been using this style brush for well over a decade.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Amazing brush for detangling. I have two large ones at home, and a smaller one in my purse. Thanks, Cricket.</li>
    <li> These are great brushes and eliminates static electricity in my hair.</li>
    <li> I Love this static free brush; the best in the market!! I&#x27;ve bought this brand for over a decade-last forever!</li>
    <li> When I first received it, I thought it was terribly small.  However it is perfect for my short, curly hair, and the price was even better than at local discount stores</li>
    <li> I really like this little brush.  Not too big or small.  I had one previously and it had a rubber sleeve on it.  The sleeve just got all tore up over time and the handle underneath it was too flimsy to hold unto so I ordered another one.  I was very happy to see that the product had been improved and did not have that rubber sleeve on it.  Instead the whole handle is a soft rubber like material. It is sturdy and should last a long time.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Small enough for my purse to carry. Works great for static control.</li>
    <li> great as a toddler brush</li>
    <li> What I ordered was exactly what I received.  I love these brushes and now my daughter loves it as well.  I had some questions initally and when I contacted the seller, they were quick to respond and very friendly.  I would definatly purchase from them again in the future.  Thank you for a wonderful experience.</li>

    <li> Been using for years and they still work great</li>
    <li> This brush is handy for blow drying since it doesn&#x27;t tangle in your hair.  The ball tips of the bristles,won&#x27;t scratch your scalp either.  Been using this brush and the larger size for over 10 hrs.  They do last, this is a replacement for a lost brush.</li>
    <li> Favorite brush of all time. This brush is so much better than any others and I am so happy that I found these online.  Thank you so much for offering these brushes.  My original I purchased in a drug store years ago....and I still use it.  Just so glad to have new ones on hand for back-ups.....I have purchased many other brushes over the years and they are still like new...because I would use them once and go back to my Fast Flo.  So glad that I could still read the Fast Flo on the handle and finally looked online and found them....YEA !!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured.....nice brush with a great price...on my doorstep in two days...big sloppy kisses to Amazon!</li>
    <li> Looking at this picture one would think they would get this brush but instead I got blue completely different brushes that I had to send back and spend more money.  Just ordered right from Cricket now.  We will see.</li>
    <li> This brush is the perfect size to carry in your purse or backpack and it doesn&#x27;t cause hair breakage. I have purchased this brush for many years.</li>
