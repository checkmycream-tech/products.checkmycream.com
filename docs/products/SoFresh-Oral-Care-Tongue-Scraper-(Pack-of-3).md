      <li>It is strong enough to get the job done and has a very nice edge.</li>
      <li>work well and comfortably.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re easy to clean</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a lot of different tongue scrapers, this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>However, I know I&#x27;m getting a clean tongue after am done.  </li>
      <li>Have been using Ora Sweet tongue scraper for over 8 years now</li>
      <li>My mouth feels fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>Each morning after brushing I use it and my breath is fresh and clean all day.  </li>
      <li>Tongue is clean and fresh and stays that way.  </li>
      <li>Fast and easy.</li>
      <li>so I bought a similar kind from CVS</li>
      <li>Eventually they snap at the top of the handle near the scoop.</li>
      <li>you notice the difference right away when you start using it.</li>
      <li>But if you really want plastic, this is the only plastic scraper I&#x27;ve tried that I really liked.</li>
      <li>Also tongue scrapping is phenomenal, a key crtitical piece in oral hygiene.</li>
      <li>does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to and lasts for years.</li>
      <li>Noticeable difference in oral hygiene after first use.</li>
      <li>I have used this in the past as well, was recommended and provided by my dentist, Good quality, thoroughly cleans the tongue and reduces the plaque, Will recommend this.</li>
      <li>Best tongue scraper - the neck can become weak after time and break though - still usable but short!</li>
      <li>Feels so much cleaner than just brushing my teeth.</li>
      <li>but I really didn&#x27;t like the one I bought from CVS</li>
      <li>Cost reasonable</li>
      <li>and I really appreciate it.</li>
      <li>They really do the job.  </li>
      <li>I suppose I&#x27;m applying too much pressure, but if I don&#x27;t, I feel like I&#x27;m not cleaning my tongue as well as I could.</li>
      <li>Not much to say... durable plastic and cleans my tongue nightly very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would be amazed at what is on your tongue and most people don&#x27;t know.</li>
      <li>The only reason for four stars is that when you order the three pack it would be nice to get each one as a different color so you can differentiate which one belongs to who.</li>
      <li>Have used this particular product for years</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m working on my second one right now.</li>
      <li>How did I live without a scrapper before.</li>
      <li>Only scraper that REALLY scrapes!</li>
      <li>I like the Ora Sweet Tongue Scraper due to it ability to cover a wider area of the tongue, as well as, the ability to show the gook that&#x27;s on the tongue.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend usage as your daily routine.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend the oral tool, it&#x27;s a MUST have for me in my daily mouth cleaning experience.</li>
      <li>Really helps to removes all the particles and bacteria that build up on your tongue after a long day.</li>
      <li>It is sturdy and after three years of using one, I barely just threw it away.</li>
      <li>No more drugs and just use the Ora Sweet daily.</li>
      <li>Really takes all the crap off leaving your mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used this product before and I loved it. It scrapes out the food residue and smell out of your tongue.</li>
    <li> I have several tongue scrapers, and I prefer the metal ones over the plastic ones. But if you really want plastic, this is the only plastic scraper I&#x27;ve tried that I really liked.</li>
    <li> work well and comfortably.  Service was excellent.  Cost reasonable</li>
    <li> Having been using these for a while now - best of them for me.  Tongue is clean and fresh and stays that way.  Easy to use and good shape.</li>
    <li> I have tried several types of tongue cleaners and this works the best for me. It is inexpensive and very effective in cleaning the tongue. I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I had one of these a few years ago and it broke.  I&#x27;ve tried two or three different kinds and nothing compares to these.  They really do the job.  Fast and easy.</li>
    <li> I had this one and used it for last 2 - 3 years.  It broke down last month so I bought a similar kind from CVS but I really didn&#x27;t like the one I bought from CVS (It feels just not right..).  I was so glad to find this product from Amazon.com.  I received this product yesterday and LOVE this product!!!</li>
    <li> I love this Tongue Scraper. It is strong enough to get the job done and has a very nice edge. I have been to a number of Gastroenterologist and the bad taste in my mouth continued even after all their tests and drugs. I was told about this item by a family member and I really appreciate it. No more drugs and just use the Ora Sweet daily. Thank you</li>
    <li> does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to and lasts for years. great product! you notice the difference right away when you start using it.</li>
    <li> The Orasweet Scraper is the most durable and effective way to rid your tongue of build up. The others on the market simply don&#x27;t compare . Highly recommend usage as your daily routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of different tongue scrapers, this is by far the best. You should send on to Oprah, so she can tout it, on her favourite things.</li>
    <li> This is the second brand of tongue scraper that I have tried and will never search further. It is sturdy and after three years of using one, I barely just threw it away. The edges were not as &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; anymore so scraping wasn&#x27;t as effecient. I&#x27;m working on my second one right now. I have&#x27;t had issues with it cracking or breaking but at the same time, I don&#x27;t use a lot of pressure when using it.</li>
    <li> Have used this particular product for years and I think it&#x27;s great.  I wouldn&#x27;t write a review if it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> good quality...works great</li>
    <li> Not much to say... durable plastic and cleans my tongue nightly very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would be amazed at what is on your tongue and most people don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using OraSweet for several years now.  I&#x27;ve traditionally purchased through a local pharmacy but a little over a year ago, they stopped carrying the Scrapers.  I&#x27;m glad I can now continue purchasing and using through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used this in the past as well, was recommended and provided by my dentist, Good quality, thoroughly cleans the tongue and reduces the plaque, Will recommend this.</li>
    <li> I like the product purchase I would recommend it to anyone. An outstanding product keep improving on these hygiene items.</li>
    <li> These do the trick, we bought the pack of three and they stand up on the sink becuase the base is wide. My kids love these as they are easy to use and colorful.</li>
    <li> I like the Ora Sweet Tongue Scraper due to it ability to cover a wider area of the tongue, as well as, the ability to show the gook that&#x27;s on the tongue.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find the OraSweet tongue scraper as effective as the Therabreath tongue cleaner.  As there was a period of time when the Therabreath was out of stock I thought I&#x27;d give the OraSweet a try.  I found this tool to be abrasive and definitely not as effective in removing debris from the tongue.</li>
    <li> While I like these scrapers because they&#x27;re rigid and don&#x27;t bend like many others, they keep snapping on me.  I broke three of them already.  They break at the litlle ball joint.  I suppose I&#x27;m applying too much pressure, but if I don&#x27;t, I feel like I&#x27;m not cleaning my tongue as well as I could.</li>
    <li> By far the best tongue scraper I&#x27;ve ever tried. Really takes all the crap off leaving your mouth feeling fresh and clean. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These tongue scrapers are the best. I&#x27;ve tried others and these are not as hard to use. I would order these again.</li>
    <li> Best tongue scraper - the neck can become weak after time and break though - still usable but short!</li>
    <li> best tongue cleaners, and i tried all of them.</li>
    <li> Does the job as advertised. Noticeable difference in oral hygiene after first use.</li>
    <li> I love the color, shape, and quality of this tongue scraper &amp; highly recommend it to anyone looking for an easy way to clean one&#x27;s tongue!!</li>
    <li> Been buying the Orasweet tongue scrapers for years because they&#x27;re very effective and easy to use.  Feels so much cleaner than just brushing my teeth.</li>
    <li> Only scraper that REALLY scrapes! The other ones just slide over ones tongue, this one digs in! Last a long time. Buy it!</li>
    <li> How did I live without a scrapper before. It&#x27;s so much better than brushing your tongue.</li>
    <li> One of my best purchases EVER!&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t imagine the stuff that lives on your tongue. If you don&#x27;t have one of these get one, your mouth will thank you!</li>
    <li> Have tried others in the market....by far, this is the best one.....!!!!</li>
    <li> The only style my husband will use</li>
    <li> I HIGHLY recommend the oral tool, it&#x27;s a MUST have for me in my daily mouth cleaning experience. Also tongue scrapping is phenomenal, a key crtitical piece in oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> This is the best brand tongue scraper and I&#x27;ve tried several. I have been using these for years and this brand works the best with the size of my tongue. My mouth feels very clean after using it and brushing my teeth. I purchased the 3 pack because they only last so long. Eventually they snap at the top of the handle near the scoop. It&#x27;s inevitable, they are only plastic!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Tongue Scraping while studying Yoga back in the day, and haven&#x27;t stopped doing it. I have used all types from metal to plastic, OraSweet Tongue Scrapers are my favorite. Just don&#x27;t get the kind that fold.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for more than a year and it does make a difference when I don&#x27;t use it.  My mouth feels fresh and clean.  I don&#x27;t leave my house without it when I am traveling.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this very specific tongue scraper for some time since I purchased it at a local store.  Glad to have found them here.  They&#x27;re easy to clean and I love the size.  I&#x27;ve used others and this one works best for me versus other designs I&#x27;ve seen and tried.  The only reason for four stars is that when you order the three pack it would be nice to get each one as a different color so you can differentiate which one belongs to who.</li>
    <li> Have been using Ora Sweet tongue scraper for over 8 years now and I love it.  Each morning after brushing I use it and my breath is fresh and clean all day.  Really helps to removes all the particles and bacteria that build up on your tongue after a long day. You can actually see all the gunge that comes out and it can really be gross.  However, I know I&#x27;m getting a clean tongue after am done.  I highly recommend this product if you want fresher and pleasant breath.</li>
