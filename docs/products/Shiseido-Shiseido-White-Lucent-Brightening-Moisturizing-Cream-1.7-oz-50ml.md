    <li> Texture is good, but I don&#x27;t notice big difference in my skin after using up a full jar.</li>
    <li> I love this.  I have brunette olive skin, and this tends to lose its brightness as the years roll on.  Using this, I do believe my skin is brighter.  No more dull, faded, worn-out skin look.  Expensive, but a little goes a long way, and it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
    <li> Nice and smooth. Makes everything else look good! When I use Shiseido, I am always asked what I use for foundation and where to buy.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea. I bought White Lucent for moisturizing and hopefully to even out the redness due to my rosacea. Surprise! The cream, used twice daily, was so effective in eliminating the redness that I was able to stop using the Rx antibiotic and  Rx metrocream prescribed for this condition.  The miracle ingredient seems to be the trans-examic acid. White Lucent is also a great moisturizing cream for my extra-dry skin. Do use the little plastic scoop to remove the little bit of cream you need, not your fingers, as you will contaminate the cream left in the jar and get breakouts.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with Shiseido and so far I am liking the effect on my skin.  Hopeful in the product.</li>
    <li> Where it at night!  Very nice product!</li>
    <li> It worked very well. I started to see a difference in my face within a few days of using it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Really helped with my red spots. I&#x27;m so sensitive to most lotions I put on my face.  I didn&#x27;t break out and it really has improved the appearance of my skin.  I had old acne scarring I wanted to get rid of and it is taking away the spots.  I love it and I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I hate to write negative reviews..but this product really got to me. I had pretty decent skin, i was looking to brighten some old scars on my face but this just made me break out everyday for the 2-3 days I used it and hence im left with even more scars. Everyone&#x27;s skin works differently. This product was def. not for mine.</li>
    <li> It really does brighten my skin</li>
    <li> Great product which provides excellent results.  I have super sensitive skin and this does not distress it. It gives a beautiful glowing finish and healthy happy skin</li>
    <li> I have started uvwhite 17 years ago and followed this brand till now. I tried some other big brands these years, but only White Lucent brings me good whitening result I want...</li>
    <li> Worth the money. My face really feels radiant and smooth.</li>
    <li> Not heavy, not too light, great night time moisturizer  in spring and summer used with whitening serum. Nice lite scent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good Shiseido product.  I wish it were a little less expensive.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not new and the container is not full, there&#x27;s a big space inside...</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend, I checked pricing at department store&#x27;s (outrageous!!)..Purchased through Amazon at a great price, and it absolutely works fantastic. Best product out in the market for the face, if your looking to brighten your skin and diminish age spots...Totally Recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s sister gave me a sample package of this, along with the cleanser and balancer. They work beautifully! A little goes a looong way, particularly with this moisturizer. I&#x27;m sure that little 0.25 oz jar will last me quite some more time. At least a month! It soaks up fairly quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave me oily after it dries. Love the gel texture! And the packaging is adorable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con is the price. I was looking it up to buy when I ran out, but I cannot afford such a high price! Guess it&#x27;s back to st. Ives collagen elastin facial moisturizer when this is done. (Though it too is a great moisturizer, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but there is something too lovely about this one!) Also, I&#x27;m not sure I noticed much brightning, but my skin does look smooth (though that could be from other factors...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I love this cream and heavily recommend it to anyone who can splurge in these things!</li>
    <li> Maybe that&#x27;s what the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; in the product&#x27;s name really refers to....because that&#x27;s what it did for me.  I have no idea if the product works....and I&#x27;m not going to continue using it to find out.</li>
    <li> Very good cream my face have a different look...</li>
    <li> It works very well for nurturing and keeping my skin filled with moisture.  I also use it on my hands.  Not too heavy of a night cream.  Soaks right into the skin and you don&#x27;t feel oily.  Expensive.  I&#x27;ve shopped around and found this to be the cheapest place (to date) that I can find this product.</li>
    <li> The product works exactly as it states.....brightens the skin and feels like silk on your skin.</li>
    <li> The cream is rich.  I love it.  I am in my 40&#x27;s and recommended to my sister in her 50&#x27;s.  We both just love this cream.</li>
    <li> 4-6 weeks for delivery. That&#x27;s so 1970.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say anything about the product because I bought for my wife. She seems to like it though.</li>
    <li> Good for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
