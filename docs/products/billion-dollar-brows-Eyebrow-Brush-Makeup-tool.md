<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Prefect brush for defining brows.</li>
    <li> The brush isn&#x27;t rigid enough to my taste.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush bc of the reviews and it did not disappoint.  It&#x27;s very well made......easy to apply my brows and I love the spooly. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use this with the Anastasia Dip Brow and it&#x27;s great. Really easy to use, and a cheaper alternative over the Anastasia brand.</li>
    <li> The brush end is nice and firm, but still has some give. Not too floppy or too stiff. Love having the spooly on the other end, it makes the brow filling process quicker and easier. Not that it&#x27;s a giant inconvenience to have a separate spooly, but I definitely prefer the two-in-one brush. Very pleased with this purchase, and would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the brush I needed, but hadn&#x27;t found in any department stores makeup department. It is the perfect length also.</li>
    <li> Product was crayon consistancy</li>
    <li> The quality of this brush was not as good as I expected.  Very light and rather flimsy, especially at the wand end. The brush is stiff for application but doesn&#x27;t allow rubbing the powder into the brow.  Better off going with a $2.00 ELF brush or, if you are willing to spend the money, a MAC.</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for over a year and use it daily. It has held up VERY well and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this eyebrow brush and applicator!  One of the best things I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
    <li> Sucks in the product but it works fine for its price. The spooly is just a tad big</li>
    <li> Both brush and spoolie work great, just as expected. The brush is very precise. Great angle. Not hard, not too soft. So far, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great eyebrow brush.  Fills in your eyebrows nicely and with precision and the spooly at the end does a fine job of blending in the powder.  Pairs well with the Billion Dollar Brows pencil.  Great price and a great cheaper alternative to the Anastasia line of eyebrow products.</li>
    <li> I got this to go along with some Anastasia DipBrow I finally managed to snag.  The fact that this is a cheap brush was actually a plus for me; because the Dipbrow is so concentrated, I needed a softer brush that picked up less pigment, otherwise I&#x27;d have brows that were *too* dark.  This works perfectly for that, and the spooly is just the right stiffness.  Pretty good bargain.</li>
    <li> I use this with my Anastasia Dip brow, works perfectly. Stiff enough to pick up product, soft enough to blend the product into my brow.</li>
    <li> See Billion Dollar Brows remarks.</li>
    <li> The brush is very thin. I was looking for a little thicker brush.</li>
    <li> Super great product!! Works super we&#x27;ll and I love it!</li>
    <li> I use this for my gel and powder eyebrow fillers. Works great with both.</li>
    <li> Not so great after a few uses, gotta keep it clean after each use.</li>
    <li> Its not stiff enough so I had no control in applying my eyebrow pomade.</li>
    <li> I travel on a regular basis and this broke after a few weeks of being in my makeup travel bag, even had it in a protective covering</li>
