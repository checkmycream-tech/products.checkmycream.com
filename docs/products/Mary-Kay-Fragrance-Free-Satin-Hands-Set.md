    <li> I love this product...makes my hands really smooth...Thanks</li>
    <li> this is my favorite product</li>
    <li> I tried this product at a Mary Kay consulting party and fell in love... I recently moved to Alaska and didn&#x27;t know anyone here who sold Mary Kay. I found it here on Amazon and purchased it in March and never received it.</li>
    <li> My hands felt soft and new like a baby!  Make sure you get the newest product, it has the prettiest package.  I love this product so much and I plan on giving it to my mother for her birthday next month.</li>
    <li> with my busy schedule as a mom, this helps me feel better at the end of the day.  My hands need pampering at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Dissapointed. Wasn&#x27;t the satin hands that is in the picture and it looked used.  The packaging was also messed up.  It was as if it was manufactured in another century. I ended up giving the lotion-like set away.  But I would have enjoyed it if it wasn&#x27;t sample sized and better presented.</li>
    <li> Stain hands  set is  everything and more. soften and remove  the dead skin from  you hands. I will be ordering the peach fragrance next.</li>
    <li> I got the peach scent and I wanted the scent free one. Next time I order, I will be sure to order the one that is scent free and not the peach one.</li>
    <li> I heard of this product on the Steve Harvey show, I decided to try it.  It make my hands soft &amp; smooth stopped my cuticles &amp; skin from peeling.  I love this product</li>
    <li> This is such a nice set.  I am giving it to my daughter for Christmas and I got a great price!</li>
    <li> The pump was defective. I had to pour the solution into my hand!</li>
    <li> this is wonderful product and a good bargain.</li>
    <li> Delivered timely.... I have used this product for years and love it!  I am sharing it with my friend for her birthday.  It leaves your hands feeling renewed!</li>
    <li> When ordering this product I was hopeful that this little bag of goodies would have included large product.  Pricey $$$  for being so small...  (samples) ???</li>

    <li> very satisfied with it. Once a week applief, keeps my hands really soft and silky. Love the product. Surely recommend it to all my friends , thank you so much Mary Kay</li>
    <li> I am a very well rounded individual in short.
