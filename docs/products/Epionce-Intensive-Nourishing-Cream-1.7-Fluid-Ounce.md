    <li> Works very well with dry skin. I like this product and recommend it.</li>
    <li> This moisturizing cream is just wonderful.  I have very sensitive skin and Epionce is at once very soothing and has not once made my skin breakout or react negatively.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great.  Was recommended to me by my dermatologist and I see why.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome cream that delivers moisture and nourishes the skin for that&lt;br /&gt;healthy glow!</li>
    <li> little on the heavy side....</li>
    <li> I was originally recommended this cream by my dermatologist. It&#x27;s very moisturizing, so during the winter, it actually keeps my skin moisturized all day. (Other creams will dry out by about 3:00pm and I&#x27;ll start seeing dry/flaky patches on my face.) I like the smell and would definitely recommend it. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because of the price point. It&#x27;s pretty expensive, and I feel like for that price it should moisturize AND eliminate wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This face cream is not just like any other face cream.  I have bought many other face creams that promise results of younger looking skin if used as indicated.  This is the first face cream that I have tried that actually delivers the promises that it makes.  I&#x27;m a middle aged women that has noticed a noticeable difference in my face wrinkles.  My face is not only smoother, but the lines and wrinkles have really diminished after using this cream.  Try it, and you too will see what I am talking about.</li>
    <li> I love all there products, It&#x27;s great for a sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melitta</li>
    <li> I started using this after a chemical peel &amp; love it so much I have continued using it. It is best for a night cream. Very hydrating.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes sensitive skin. Not easy to find a product that moisturizes and tends to stay on through night rather than leaving skin dry. We live in a dry climate. .</li>
    <li> Incredible mosturizer. Gave my skin a glow and ultimate hydration. Best if your skin us dry or you live in dry weather as I do.</li>
    <li> Refreshing aroma, good mosturizer.</li>
    <li> Brilliant item. I was advised to try this from a plastic surgery company as I wasn&#x27;t quite ready to go under the knife.  It is, in my opinion, fabulous. My skin was dehydrated and dull looking.  This cream has rejuvinated it and certainly looks like the lines are disappearing, especially around my mouth. I have been using it since June.  Expensive, but I&#x27;m worth it!</li>
    <li> A very creamy concoction! Soaks right into my skin. Originally got samples from a physician. Nice to see one can get online.</li>
    <li> Healed my keretosis, sun damaged skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered this cream after receiving a sample from a facial spa, because I loved the results - a bit of a glow.  A night cream, it absorbs immediately into my skin, leaving it fresh and moist, even in the morning.  I&#x27;ve been using it during the day as well, although I like the Epionce Nourishing Cream, too which I used in the summer, since it&#x27;s  a bit lighter.  They are both rather expensive but go a long way.  I also love the fact that the scent of both creams is very delicate and pleasant, as opposed to many other face creams I&#x27;ve tried.  I will definitely buy more of this product.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the sample of it that i got from my dermatologist, so i would highly recommend the product itself.  I  have extremely dry skin due to the medication i use for my rosecea, and most  moisturizers don&#x27;t stop the flaking skin. this cream  moisturizes so well, i no longer have the flakiness as before.</li>
    <li> I just started using this cream.  It&#x27;s awesome, I love the way it feels on my skin, and I can see the moisture is helping with little wrinkle lines. You don&#x27;t need a whole lot and it feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love my Epionce.  Arrived fast.</li>
    <li> I would swim in this jar if I could.</li>
    <li> This has a wonderful odor or orange peel and makes your face feel so great.</li>
    <li> Some of the very best moisturizer I have ever used. Intense and gentle!</li>
    <li> For very, very dry and sensitive skin a real winner. It feels so good on!</li>
    <li> This intensive nourishing cream by Epionce is one of the best night moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried them all. It&#x27;s heavier than a daily cream and feels so healing when applied at night. My skin has never been softer. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Feels great. Skin so soft.</li>
