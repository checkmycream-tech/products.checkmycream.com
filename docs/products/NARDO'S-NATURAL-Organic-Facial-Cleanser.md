    <li> I bought this on a whim and I am very pleased with this product!  It smells fantastic and feels cool on my face. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin. I hormonally break out usually and this month since using the product, I&#x27;m clear!!  The only thing that bothered me was the pump doesn&#x27;t unlock so I have to unscrew it to get any out. Irritating, but worth it. Recommend!</li>
