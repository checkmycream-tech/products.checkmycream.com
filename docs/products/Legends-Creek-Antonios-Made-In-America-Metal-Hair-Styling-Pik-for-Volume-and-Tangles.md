<li> This works to scratch my head, but it&#x27;s just too wide for my style, and I am not impressed with it.  </li>
<li> It is definitely nostalgic.</li>

<ol>
    <li> Really good and durable</li>
    <li> Great retro pick, but wins award for worst packaging ever. Shrink wrapped around each tine -- make sure you&#x27;re not in a hurry to use this.</li>
    <li> Going natural and working on my fro. This pick with the fist bring back childhood memories. I&#x27;m rockin the afro with the pick left in it....... Solid!!!!!</li>
    <li> Order arrived with a totally different style than pictured. Where the peace sign should have been was an empty circle</li>
    <li> My son is away at school in a very remote location. He made his amazon list and this was on it. When he received the pik it was supposed to be a peace sign on it but it was just a plus sign. He was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had a whole conversation about i really wanted the peace sign mom....  are you sure you ordered the right one .....blah blah blah&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He says thanks don&#x27;t worry he just was hoping for the one pictured&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pik itself is fine works well. It just isn&#x27;t what is pictured what he ordered</li>
    <li> Daughter likes it. She&#x27;s been looking for this but local stores didn&#x27;t have it. Now she can stop looking. Like</li>
    <li> I JUST GOT THIS PRETTY COOL LOOKING PICK.IT WORKS FINE.ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT IT TOOK A WHILE TO GET HERE.</li>
    <li> Its very nice,makes afro straight,overall its boss.I also have a pick like this but with a \\&quot;B\\&quot; not an Peace Sign for some reason.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gag gift so I guess it served its purpose.</li>
    <li> I love the look of it. It is definitely nostalgic. I would recommend it to anyone with natural hair as an accent.</li>
    <li> this product exceeded my expectations and reminded me of the 70&#x27;s in all their afro-tistic glory! this is the one!</li>
    <li> My son LOVES this pick! He said it feels great on his scalp and he thinks it looks cool, and so do all of his friends. I&#x27;ve been able to purchase similar ones with the fist before, but this was the only one I could find with the fist and the peace sign, which means I also love it (though I don&#x27;t use it for my hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a kick out of putting power and peace together. It&#x27;s pretty great to me that my son loves it too!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s real strong and cool</li>
    <li> Works great and I will definitely be purchasing from here again if I need to get another cable.</li>
    <li> Nice pik and it also came with the peace sign works great as well</li>
    <li> Product came in quickly and in good condition. The only issue I had was that the &amp;#34;peace&amp;#34; sign was a cross instead. I knew this defect going in for the purchase but this is something they should definitely work on. Product also appears to come with a comb.</li>
    <li> its just a pick so its not that big of a deal, doesnt have peace symbol like picture... more like cross hairs on a gun...</li>
    <li> My grandson asked for this &amp; loves it.. He carries it with him all the time &amp; it is well built.</li>
    <li> This works to scratch my head, but it&#x27;s just too wide for my style, and I am not impressed with it.  I was hoping to fine a Goody, but apparently they are obsolete.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see that Antonio Banderas made a hair styling pik. It&#x27;s a very traditional design with a nice feel. It&#x27;s very sturdy and makes a great gift.</li>
    <li> This took my afro to a whole new level. With this pick and some soul glow I turned into shaft.</li>
    <li> Yes, its a hair pick, but the middle doesnt have a peace sign. It has a cross. Misrepresented whats sold.</li>
    <li> Saving Grace, this hits allllll the right spots, with out damaging your hair</li>
    <li> I wanted a styling pic but I thought that I would get the one from the photo but what I got was with a cross on it instead of a peace sign. It works very well and does just as good a job as the one I lost, I am just dissapointed there is no peace sign in mine.</li>
    <li> holly smokes! I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m this blown away from a hair oil but I am. I&#x27;ve used super expensive brushes, expensive wide tooth combs,  and not so expensive ones,  but this pik here is the best. I&#x27;m a Latina with very long wavy thick hair and this is by far the most gentle and sturdiest hair comb/piki ever used! Better than mason Pearson, Hercules Sagemann,  and others. Highly recommend this lovely hair pik,  you&#x27;ll feel the same way I&#x27;m sure. This goes through hair like a knife on butter!</li>
    <li> very good hair pick and not expensive too!</li>
    <li> Feels good on my head. Fluffs up my fro real nice. I feel empowered whenever I use it. A great afro pick!</li>
    <li> I just received this pik and realized that, like the others mentioned, it does not have a peace sign in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;Instead, it has a plus sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be appreciated if the product matched the description.</li>
    <li> I ordered this pick because i have been searching for a pick with a peace sign then it came with a plus sign.This pick does not work well either.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use these on my hair at all - they are very good for strumming on my Cajun rub board!</li>
    <li> i could have bought it here for the same price as yours. it was my grandson who ordered it ,telling me they were not available here.. Of course i could have bought another 3 with the postage money.. it is good , and it was my stupidity that made me allow him to use my card,, thank you anyway, I will be checking more in future</li>
    <li> Great for afros. (im a guy). rounded tips so it doesnt pull hair. been using plastic picks all my life but metal is much better</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED!!! I love it and I take it everywhere with me... even tho  only have a &amp;#34;baby fro&amp;#34; It suits my needs perfectly!</li>
    <li> My son loved this pick and it was shipped and delivered to me fast. The quality was great and the cost was very acceptable. If you had one back in the day and need another one for yourself or a family member order soon it makes a great stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> Very big but good to use. better for someone with lots of hair but does a good job either way.</li>
