      <li>But does a pretty good job of making my make up look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paula V</li>
      <li>strange and excellent product for my skin.  </li>
      <li>It makes fine lines almost disappear when used under a good concealer, and provides just the right amount of moisture.  </li>
      <li>give you the most unbelivably smooth matt finish and your make up</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t share many revews ladies, but this product is hands down the best.</li>

      <li>This primer seems to work fine.  </li>
      <li>It concealed my fine lines and wrinkles too.</li>
      <li>THIS IS A GREAT PRIMER AND HAS BECOME VERY HARD TO FINDS, SO I WAS HAPPY TO FIND IT HERE.</li>
      <li>Silky smooth under makeup</li>
      <li>My make-up goes on smoothly after applying the primer.  </li>
      <li>but I think it just came available for purchase.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money, and I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it...</li>
      <li>My face feels smooth</li>
      <li>Makes my face feels silky smooth.</li>
      <li>I wear the light foundation in BareMinerals and a beige color in the BareNaturale Foundation.</li>
      <li>It goes on silky smooth.</li>
      <li>It makes your face so smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>Great cream, only place to find it</li>
      <li>Using it on a clean moisturized face with NO retinol&lt;br /&gt;will  </li>
      <li>I had pills all over myself: in my hair, on my clothes... it took forever to roll it off my face, clean myself up, and start over.</li>
      <li>but I mostly bought it to make my makeup last longer and go on more smoothly, and it accomplishes those goals.  </li>
      <li>Will make your skin velvety smooth and really diminishes the fine lines around my eyes and forehead.</li>
      <li>It seems to make some of my fine lines disappear (temporarily) and really evens out my complexion.</li>
      <li>It really does make my foundation look smooth and helps cover lines and pores.</li>
      <li>so well it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>Because its gray - it looks kind of weird, but this stuff is great.  </li>
      <li>Nice and smooth to apply made my face look like I had less wrinkles</li>
      <li>I love this product , It is the greatest,I don&#x27;t even need to put makeup on, it makes my face look natural and flawless you only need to use a small amount.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also used Illamasqua&#x27;s satin primer and Avon&#x27;s Magix primers before, but this one definitely feels more like Smashbox or Tarte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just gave up since most likely they will all be expired since they were discontinued a couple of years ago.</li>
      <li>Price is pretty steep, but it works</li>
      <li>I like this ROC primer pretty well.</li>
      <li>NOW to get back to how the ROC PRIMER has magically changed my face...</li>
      <li>I have very fair, forty year old skin that has seen lots of sun, wind and late nights and</li>
      <li>That said, I feel like it has been nice and subtly changed the appearance of fine lines.</li>
      <li>It dusts off easily though, and isn&#x27;t reason enough for me not to use this primer.</li>
      <li>I am thrilled to have found it on Amazon for half what I was paying at the drugstore.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice the anti-aging effects, but I felt compelled to leave a review so soon due to the impressive results I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
      <li>The product glides on smoothly and allows make up to stay put the entire day.  </li>
      <li>Thanks, Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>but I really notice when it sticks to my nose.</li>
      <li>this stuff really helps.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m honestly very ambivalent about this product.</li>
      <li>This stuff works very well.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really seem to do anything at all.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>the stuff that is left on the paper that you have to blow and brush off, its actually kind of gross.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to use this for as long as it is available.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> strange and excellent product for my skin.  It looks ugly... (green color) but the result is rather amazing!</li>
    <li> Surprised that the primer was gray in color, but seems work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 2 weeks and I have seen magic.  If you have used a primer before, then you may have experienced after using BareMinerals ( or if you use a powder foundation), that your brissels on your brushes get clumpy from the primer and powder formulas gathering on the brissles of your make-up brush. WELL NOT WITH THIS PRODUCT! Yes, I try to clean my brushes at least once a week. And I will admit, I do extend at times to two weeks BUT my point is my cleaning time has been cut in half. I have less make-up gunk on my brushes as I normally would. NOW to get back to how the ROC PRIMER has magically changed my face... My makeup sticks alot better all over but I really notice when it sticks to my nose. My face has become more toned (those little dark spots are lighter, red spots have almost disappeared completely) AND my pores appear to be smaller. My skin tone is light (not fair). I wear the light foundation in BareMinerals and a beige color in the BareNaturale Foundation. I will say though, I have been using a Mary Kay liquid foundation for the past week and my brushes seem to have no \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; on them and it appears to be doing the same magic as it has for me when I use a powder foundation. Also, buying this product online for half the cost compared to buying it from a drugstore or at a make-up junkie store, makes this product a real steal!!!</li>
    <li> this is some of the best face primer I have used..it goes on like silk and I usually just wear it with no make on over the top..I love the feel of it..would and will buy it again!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works very well. Have purchased repeatedly.</li>
    <li> I love it! My make-up goes on smoothly after applying the primer.  I cannot wait to try the eye primer. I will buy this product again.    Emilie Goldy</li>
    <li> I have looked everywhere for this stuff!!! Finally I found it on Amazon. I&#x27;m not sure but I think it just came available for purchase.&lt;br /&gt;My mother in law does these studies for products. This product was one she did a study for. She let me in on this one. I LOVED this stuff from the moment I put it on my face. It makes your face so smooth and silky. After about 2 weeks of use, I got many compliments on my skin. Small visible lines were disappearing, my skin was more toned. I knew this was the stuff for me! Then I ran out! And I looked everywhere for it. Finally after months of searching, I found it! I&#x27;ve been using for about 5 days now and I already see results again. Lines are fading, skin tone is more even, this stuff works!!!</li>
    <li> The package appeared to have been opened, and the tube looked as though it had been used...but the product does make my skin ultra soft. Unfortunately, it does flake.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It feels like silk. It covers great so you do not have to use alot of it. I was a sunshine girl so there are a few lines on my face here or there, this stuff makes my face feel soft and smooth. I can see results and I have used it for about a month. Now it&#x27;s not magic, I still have lines and wrinkles but my skin does look better when I use this. If your going to use a face primer this is the one. You can still use your daily moisturizer and always use sun block.</li>
    <li> I had been using this for a while when my daughter came home from college. We were hanging out in front of the bathroom mirror, all of a sudden my daughter looks over at me and says,\\&quot;Mom, your skin is perfect.\\&quot;  I am a slacker when it comes to skin care. (Sorry.) The following week, I surprised my Mom with this as a gift. 5 Stars This product works.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It is more than just a primer but improves skins appearance and elasticity over time as well. I have very fair, forty year old skin that has seen lots of sun, wind and late nights and this stuff really helps. Works beautifully on the neck and chest too. It should come in a bigger bottle if it were up to me. I am thrilled to have found it on Amazon for half what I was paying at the drugstore. Will make your skin velvety smooth and really diminishes the fine lines around my eyes and forehead. You will be pleased with the results, I&#x27;d jump in a tub of this stuff if I could!</li>
    <li> This a great product!  It goes on smooth and provides a great base for foundation.  Does a great job hiding fine lines.</li>
    <li> Have tried many products over decades.  Read about this product on the internet.  Has a gray tinge that reduces flaws.  Bought it first at a local store and could not locate when I ran out.  Panicked, then tried Amazon.  Purchased for about half the price.  Product lasts about 3 months.  Seriously, you may not need to wear foundation if you use this product as it evens out your skin tone.  The texture of your skin will amaze you.  Don&#x27;t share many revews ladies, but this product is hands down the best.</li>
    <li> I love this product , It is the greatest,I don&#x27;t even need to put makeup on, it makes my face look natural and flawless you only need to use a small amount.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRIMER AND HAS BECOME VERY HARD TO FINDS, SO I WAS HAPPY TO FIND IT HERE. I BOUGHT THREE TUBES FROM TWO SELLERS, AS I KNOW IT IS GOING EXTINCT.</li>
    <li> Because its gray - it looks kind of weird, but this stuff is great.  My face has never felt so soft. Its not greasy at all, and is immediately dissolved into the skin.</li>
    <li> I tried this product based on the reviews and I am so glad that I did! I am a nurse and after 12 hours my makeup would be gone even though I used primers from other manufacturers. Well after a very busy 12 hour shift with this primer my makeup was still in place! This is definitely a keeper and I will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It goes on smooth and feels good. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  Does a pretty good&lt;br /&gt;job of acting like a &amp;#34;canvas&amp;#34; before putting on my foundation.  Doesn&#x27;t perform any miracles, at age 60&lt;br /&gt;you can&#x27;t expect that. But does a pretty good job of making my make up look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paula V</li>
    <li> I am on my third tube of Roc Brilliance Anti-aging Face Primer, and I have to say it really does work.  It makes fine lines almost disappear when used under a good concealer, and provides just the right amount of moisture.  The tube lasts a decent amount of time and it is not greasy.</li>
    <li> It definitely smoothes out your complexion. It feels very light when wearing.</li>
    <li> i HAVE SPENT A FORTUNE ON \\&quot;ANTI AGING\\&quot; PRODUCTS BUT WHEN I ORDERED \\&quot;ROC BRILLIANCE\\&quot; ANTI AGING FACE PRIMER, I WAS AMAZED AT THE RESULTS...I AM 69 YRS OLD AND WORKOUT AT LEAST 3-4 TIMES A WEEK, I USE THIS IN THE A.M. AND IT SMOOTHES MY FACE SO I DON&#x27;T EVEN HAVE TO PUT MAKEUP ON....WHEN I GO OUT IN THE EVENING, I USE \\&quot;ROC BRILLIANCE\\&quot; UNDER MY MAKEUP AND IT TAKES AWAY ANY WRINKLES OR DARK SPOTS.  I AM TRULY SOLD ON THIS PRODUCT AND WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE.</li>
    <li> I have tried L&#x27;Oreal primer previously and thought that the results were all that I should expect. Then I tried Roc Brilliance- now I keep the L&#x27;Oreal for times when I don&#x27;t really have to look my best. The Roc goes on like silk and your makeup will stay on for a long, long time. It does everything it says it will and more. I wouldn&#x27;t ever use any other face primer- a steal for the price !</li>
    <li> When I needed to pick up a new primer, I thought I&#x27;d try something new, so I checked out reviews on the Makeup Alley website, and saw that this had really high ratings. Since it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than the primer I&#x27;d been using, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try -- and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In feel and texture, I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s comparable to Smashbox&#x27;s or Tarte&#x27;s clear primer, but at a fraction of the price of those higher-end brands.  I&#x27;ve also used Illamasqua&#x27;s satin primer and Avon&#x27;s Magix primers before, but this one definitely feels more like Smashbox or Tarte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with other reviewers, I was a bit leery of the gray color to this primer, but the gray vanishes and you&#x27;re left with smooth skin.  I also have been using this over my moisturizer and sunscreen, and have had no piling or balling, which I&#x27;ve had with other primers.  I usually let my moisturizer and sunscreen sink in while I do my hair, and then apply primer right before I do my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this really has any anti-aging benefits, but I mostly bought it to make my makeup last longer and go on more smoothly, and it accomplishes those goals.  I&#x27;ll definitely re-purchase this!</li>
    <li> This primer seems to work fine.  I also like the L&#x27;Oreal one the best but this one does the trick as well.  I would recommend this one, even though it comes out with a kind of purple tinge to it.  It doesn&#x27;t show up on the face that way, though, especially if you&#x27;re putting make-up on over it!</li>
    <li> I swear I received this within 3 days of ordering I have never used a primer so not sure what to expect but its extremely silky!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, to bad they do not make it anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m honestly very ambivalent about this product. When initially applied, it hid a multitude of sins - wrinkles, large pores, and left a very silky, matte finish. However, once I started applying mineral makeup with a brush everything began rolling off. I had pills all over myself: in my hair, on my clothes... it took forever to roll it off my face, clean myself up, and start over. Not good when you&#x27;re running late for work in the morning! I continue to use the product on days when I don&#x27;t wear makeup, but will not make the mistake again of using it UNDER makeup, at least not my makeup. I can&#x27;t speak to liquid foundation, so YMMV.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It is as all have described. A little goes a long way</li>
    <li> Silky smooth under makeup</li>
    <li> After using this product my makeup felt like it just glided on. It concealed my fine lines and wrinkles too. Roc products rock!!! I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like this ROC primer pretty well. It is very smoothing under foundation and seems to help make-up last longer.&lt;br /&gt;FYI I bought this 12/5/2011 on Amazon for $12.20. The name changed from ROC Anti-aging Face Primer to \\&quot;\\&quot;Brilliance\\&quot; and \\&quot;e-pulse\\&quot; and the price sky-rocketed. I see the same ingredients and when i visit this page it lets me know i bought this 1 year ago for $12.20.</li>
    <li> I love the matte finish this gives my face since I&#x27;m a little oily. It seems to make some of my fine lines disappear (temporarily) and really evens out my complexion. It goes on silky smooth. Definitely let it set &amp; dry before applying any other makeup though or else it pills.</li>
    <li> I have ordered ROC for my 86 year old mom for the past year, she says it makes her skin feel silky smooth. She won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Leaves your face with a wonderful base for your make-up. It fills in lines and prepares age spots for good coverage.</li>
    <li> Waste of money... didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> This review is not about the actual product. It&#x27;s about Amazon selling expired products. Roc has discontinued this item in 2012. I started breaking out after the second use so I did the cosmetic calculator to check the expiration date. It turned out it was manufactured on January of 2010. I called Roc and they told me not to use it as it is past the 3yrs shelf life. I returned it and ordered another one, the same issue happened. I just gave up since most likely they will all be expired since they were discontinued a couple of years ago.</li>
    <li> Great cream, only place to find it</li>
    <li> Nice and smooth to apply made my face look like I had less wrinkles I was a little hesitant to apply it when I saw the grey color&lt;br /&gt;but it worked fine, happy with product.</li>
    <li> I like how this goes on I use it over my moisturizer. I tried the olay covergirl primer and it burned my eyes and did nothing for my skin but the Roc does my skin good.</li>
    <li> This is the best primer ever! Price is pretty steep, but it works so well it&#x27;s worth the price. Smooths and covers as promised.</li>
    <li> I love this primer for its matting effect. It really does make my foundation look smooth and helps cover lines and pores. I haven&#x27;t yet really noticed a change in my fine lines without makeup, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks. Now, all that said, it does sometimes &#x27;pill&#x27; when I put on my liquid foundation. It dusts off easily though, and isn&#x27;t reason enough for me not to use this primer. The grey color mentioned by others is definitely different, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t look grey on your skin.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feels silky smooth. Will keep getting this product!</li>
    <li> This product ROCKS!!  I have only used one primer before from &#x27;Sheer Cover, and this is a far better product.  My face feels smooth, it doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin break out, my skin looks less oily than normal after several hours, and interestingly enough, it makes my face/forehead perspire less during physical activity!  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice the anti-aging effects, but I felt compelled to leave a review so soon due to the impressive results I&#x27;ve had.  It&#x27;s worth the money, and I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it...although I may have to try MAC&#x27;s primer, just to compare the two.  No matter what, this is a great product!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s the best! Makeup stays on great with it all day! It&#x27;s hard to find but worth the hunt.</li>
    <li> I can NOT believe the reviews for this stuff.  I wanted to try a primer under my foundation so I purchased this item  I put my serum on then the primer and when I go to put my foudation on this stuff rubs off like if you have a glue on your skin and pills up and off,like a pencil eraser after you use it and the stuff that is left on the paper that you have to blow and brush off, its actually kind of gross.  I even tried not using my serum and it did the same thing.  I bought two bottles of this stuff because it was on sale and the raving reviews, Man am I disappointed, nothing like throwing you money away. The Wet and Wild Primer was Better.....it stayed on.</li>
    <li> i used this for over 2 months and was a waste of money and time is also it cost to much money i won&#x27;t waste my money and this product i like roc but this product need to be put out the market</li>
    <li> Product got rave reviews on here so I ordered. I feel like it does a good job. Smoother, feels great when you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;Has it significantly changed my skin the way it did for other people who reviewed it, not so much. That said, I feel like it has been nice and subtly changed the appearance of fine lines. I WILL order again if for no other reason than it feels great putting it on.</li>
    <li> I indicated it was not easy to apply; I finally seem to have learned, but initially it was a problem. All in all, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> First time I tried this product and it felt amazing on my face!  Your skin is instantly smoothed and softened.  Good stuff!!  I will be buying more of this for sure.&lt;br /&gt;I really, really liked it.  Thanks, Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I love everything ROC and it&#x27;s a good Primer.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Definitely an improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> This was not the epulse but another  older primer.  For the price this was a rip off.  The wording on the tube did not match the wording on the box.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have used it for at least a year now.  Could not find it in the stores.  So I checked&lt;br /&gt;online and found it .  I will continue to use this for as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> My daughter use Roc products since were recommended and she loves this brand. She uses night, day and eyes products.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really seem to do anything at all.</li>
    <li> I like all ROC products.  This does occasionally roll into little balls on your face.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It works great as a primer before you put on your foundation.</li>
    <li> The product glides on smoothly and allows make up to stay put the entire day.  It made my face feel incredibly silky.  I would recommend this to anyone that either hasn&#x27;t tried a face primer or is looking to switch face primers.  The price is also a plus when you look around at the cost of other products of this type.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  The reason why some find that it peels or flarkes upon application is because it reacts badly when applied over any product containing retinol.  I&#x27;m not sure why this is not compatible with these kind of products.  I have experimented with this because It also happened to me the first several times I used it.  Using it on a clean moisturized face with NO retinol&lt;br /&gt;will  give you the most unbelivably smooth matt finish and your make up just glides on.  I order this stuff 3 or 4 at a time.</li>
