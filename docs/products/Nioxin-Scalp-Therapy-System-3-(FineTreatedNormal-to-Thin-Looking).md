<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use system 3 cleanser and conditioner</li>
    <li> Great product.  I started using this 8 years ago when my hair was starting to thin and have been using it ever since.  It leaves my hair feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> The Nioxin products do a great job of keeping the hair and scalp clean. The ones for color treated hair are more gentle than the original and keep the color intact while still working well.    I also like the smell which is maybe mint or eucalyptus.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling fuller and softer, easier to control and a nice smell. Liter bottles mean that I don&#x27;t have to buy it very often.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nioxin products for years. I have actually had hair regrowth since I began to use these products. I just recently began to order from Amazon.com...I don&#x27;t have to make special trips to hair salons and I get a better price on the product.  I&#x27;d recommend Nioxin products to anyone with thinning hair!</li>
    <li> Use this conditioner to make your hair fuller and healthier. Not just for thinning hair!</li>
    <li> When I first tried Nioxin, I got system 4.  It made my head itch like crazy and so I decided to try system 3.  I still have some itching, but my husband says my hair looks much thicker and even though I don&#x27;t think so, I am going to keep using it.  I&#x27;ve only been using the products for about 3 months and my hair dresser said it would take about 6 months to notice a difference.  I will keep it up until then.</li>
    <li> ON THE FIRST USE IT TURNED MY (COLOR TREATED GOLDEN BLONDE) HAIR GREEN!  NOT A SHOCK I CARE TO REPEAT!  MAYBE IT&#x27;S JUST ME.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Keeps my hair very healthy.  The price is great, and the delivery is always on time.  Will be a regular customer for this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin in the past and had pretty good results.  I found that using it for a couple of months then changing to another product for awhile did best for my hair.  The one thing about the Scalp Therapy they put out now is that the ingredients and even the name of the product is different and along with that is the results I get...not as good as the original product was.  I do like the minty smell..at least they left it in the ingredients even if it is not as noticable as it used to be.  My question is why change something that already works???</li>
    <li> I was doubtful my dermatologist told me to try using something along this line (minoxidil) but nioxin was similar product.  My hair was shedding, very thin and losing my hairline after the birth of my twins (9 mo at the time). After 3 months I saw a dermatologist he mentioned this type of shampoo/treatment.  I&#x27;ve been doing for 60 days now &amp; cannot believe how thick my hair is &amp; my hairline has grown back.  Not sure if it&#x27;s all due to the Nioxin treatment system but have to know it&#x27;s helped a great deal.  I&#x27;ve told my husband I cannot believe it-he even noticed the shedding after showering has decreased so much.  It&#x27;s amazing stuff, I never would&#x27;ve believed I&#x27;d be writing such a successful review-but sooooo glad I am!!!  It&#x27;s worth a shot!</li>
    <li> This is a good product for people with thinning hair.  Due to an illness, my hair falls out and this has helped quite a bit.  It was orignally given to me as a gift from a wonderful women who helped me during the start of my illness.  It really does work for thinning hair and I believe it would also be great on fine hair.  I have been using it for about seven years now.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Used it for years. Not going to change.</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle worker. Use it regularly and you will see and feel the difference! Thicker, stronger hair!</li>
    <li> I have tried all sorts of other conditioners from staying over at friends houses but this is the only one that truly works for my hair.  Some of my friends have stayed the night and tried it and unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for them though so I think this is one you&#x27;ll have to try for yourself to see if it works. My hair is rather thin and straight but there is a lot of it and it tends to get greasy if I don&#x27;t condition it often enough while most of theirs were a bit more dry. A 1.5L bottle lasted me about a year of conditioning ~3 times a week with a quarter sized dollop.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t BAD really, but never really did much for my hair.</li>
    <li> A lot of people look for some sort of miracle item to make their hair grow back. Even the products that are proven to regrow hair usually don&#x27;t help that much.   But with Nioxin Conditioner what hair you have at least looks more healthy. Using this with the Shampoo, and the other products from Nioxin, seems to make your existing hair look thicker.   For a while I didn&#x27;t use the Nioxin products and I can honestly say that when I wasn&#x27;t using it my hair looked thinner.   I&#x27;m sure that each person will have differing experiences with this product, but if you are self conscious about your thinning hair, you may want to give this a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING NIOXIN FOR OVER A YEAR. VERY LITTLE HAIR LOSS DURING THAT TIME.</li>
    <li> I got this stuff because my wife decided that this would help my thinning hair.  The folks who buzz my hair every few weeks said it is very good shampoo.  Thus to make my wife happy I replaced my organic shampoo with this stuff.    It gets my hair clean.  I&#x27;m not sure about any other benefits.    We got the chemically treated formula so my wife can use it too.  My understanding is that I should perhaps have a different formula for optimal results.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have used this for years and got great results and then several months ago we both started noticing our scalp was itching. I don&#x27;t know if they changed the ingredients or what but we had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> The product shipped with no problems. I love this stuff I started using it when my hair started thinning 2 years ago and it made it stop falling out after like a week of use.</li>
    <li> Always use these shampoo and conditioner products for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I was a non-believer, until I used this product over a period of several weeks. It really does aid in thickening one&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product from a seller on Amazon (Khanh Hoang Mai) to only find out that it was either watered down or mixed with another solution. I say this because I bought the same exact product from Smart Styles in Walmart and it was very strong and creamy and now my hair has shine and body since purchasing from Smart Styles.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works awesome!!  If you have dry scalp, eczema or flakes this conditioner is great.   It does not weigh down hair and you don&#x27;t get that weird \\&quot;tight\\&quot; feeling on your scalp when you rinse it out.   I use it with the shampoo.   I have color treated hair and it doesn&#x27;t bleach or fade it!!</li>
    <li> I have relied on Nioxin for years and credit it with my not losing hair as many people do during a time when I was on high prednisone&lt;br /&gt;medication.  My hair is fine and I wash it every day so I need something very gentle.  Now that my hair is a little longer, it does not always have quite the body I would like but I resist using hair spray.</li>
    <li> I had been suffering from severe hair loss. There was hair all over my bathroom floor, pillow, and tonnes in my hair brush. In my case hair loss is a hereditary problem for men and women of my family.    I started using the shampoo and conditioner and I swear to god my hair completely stopped falling, in less than 2 weeks.    Now I have been using it for about 2 months, hair is actually growing back on my hairline! I keep the conditioner in my hair for like 1 min thats all. Even then its working. Good luck!!!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend it to anyone with scalp or hair issues.  It&#x27;s wonderful and we would never be without it in our household.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like the large bottle but the product is good and I just put it into a smaller bottle to use.  I like how it works on my scalp....minty and a little cool feeling.  Helps with dandruff (I have an oily dandruff scalp with dry hair).</li>
    <li> This was received promptly.  It is a quality product.  I have purchased other shampoos for chemical treated hair and this one retains the color and shine best.</li>
    <li> I will never go without this conditioner. It really does seem to help with growth and strength.</li>
    <li> The savings is tremendous verses purchasing in a hair saloon or store.  95% of the time we order from Amazon.  The only reason we don&#x27;t is if we fail to place the order and don&#x27;t have time to wait.</li>
    <li> I used to love the OLD formula of Nioxin and I thought that was what I was ordering since the picture is of the OLD formula.  I received the NEW formula and had to return it.  About 1-2 years ago, Nioxin reformulated their products and outsourced everything to Mexico.  It is no longer made in the US.  When my hair started falling out again after I started using the new formula, I called Wella (the manufacturer) and asked them what happened.  They said they &amp;#34;added more lathering agents&amp;#34; (which means they diluted the active ingredient).  If you are reading good reviews on Nioxin, it is most like the OLD product formula which I loved.  The seller shipped quickly and was WONDERFUL in their return process (my account was credited quickly), but the item is not as pictured.  The picture needs to be updated.</li>
    <li> keeps my hair healthy..have used this for over 6 years now along with the shampoo. great product for men with long hair like me.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner. Always makes my scalp feel great and very clean.</li>
    <li> I love the minty smell and the slight tingling sensation on my scalp that let me know it was working.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product along with System 1 for three years now and love it. System 1 cleanses my hair and System 3 is like a cream rinse.</li>
    <li> I have dealt with hair loss from illness and this product does make hair appear thicker.  I will use no other product.  There is a strong minty-something smell to get used to, but once you do you&#x27;ll love it! I use lots of products from this line! It was a great bargain online and it arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Great deal. Good product.</li>
    <li> Has keep my hair looking better than any other shampoo and conditioner that I&#x27;ve used. A bit pricey but well worth the money if you have fine hair. Seems to work best in the winter months for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many conditioners for fine hair and this is my favorite.  It seems to work the best, giving my hair much more texture and lift.  I have very fine, but fairly thick hair and I imagine this would work quite well for fine, thin hair.  When I leave it in for a minute or so, my scalp tingles a bit.  I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, so I don&#x27;t know if this would be a problem for those who do.  I just see it as a sign that it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> This product made my already thinning hair terribly damaged. After having children my hair was very healthy, but very thin. I used this product in hopes of strengthening and thickening my hair, and it did the complete opposite. My hair fell out in clumps. I read some reviews that said that ones hair may fall out at first and to just keep using it, so I did, but it never stopped falling out. Now, the hair that I have left feels dry and damaged, and even thinner than before. Save yourself some heartache and stay away from this product. I&#x27;m a 35 year old female who looks almost bald from this product. Stay away.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair look and feel fuller and thicker</li>
    <li> This was just what I needed to refill my current bottle and at a great price.  I&#x27;m very happy with the product and wanted to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using nioxin for a long time &amp; I really love it! It makes my chemically treated hair feel amazing! This container was huge &amp; totally worth the price!</li>
    <li> Great product and reasonably priced</li>
    <li> I was told that it would help my scalp regrow hair and it makes a big difference in the regrowth.  I have to massage my scalp a long time but it works.</li>
    <li> I swear by Nioxin.  Love this product and it works.  The price was right.</li>
    <li> The product is exactly what I ordered.  Although the shipper did not ship the complete order until I called and reported the incomplete shipment. Although the complaint was taken seriously and shipped immediately to my satisfaction.  I use this product for something completely different than stated.  I use this product for pain in my sciatica.  This was a recommendation by a hair stylist that had many situations with Cancer patients in Chemotherapy treatments.  Actually the patients are the ones that told her what they use it for.  It works!!!</li>
    <li> Lovi it will shop again:)</li>
    <li> I use this as a daily shampoo and can tell a difference when I miss even just a few days.  My hair feels so clean and full after using this product (plus I love the minty scent).  Would recomend for anyone with fine hair; even if you have a lot of it.</li>
    <li> It seems to help and when used with the shampoo, it really cleans my hair and it feels fuller.</li>
    <li> I started using this product approximately a month ago, both the shampoo and conditioner. Perhaps it&#x27;s the wrong treatment for my type of hair loss, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a bit of improvement in the strength of my hair follicles and certainly no re growth. The only difference I&#x27;ve noticed in my hair is how dry it looks and feels. I&#x27;ve read the reviews before making my purchase because I&#x27;ve read how much this product has helped other women. I now have a small bald patch on the crown of my head. I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion perhaps my issue is something that cannot be fixed by this type of treatment, and so I give it two stars.</li>
    <li> I like how it was wrapped so well to prevent any damage or spills.  Thanks for the thoughtfulness!  Will recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I don&#x27;t have thinning hair it just gives a healthy shiny look to me and I also furnish it for my adult granddaughter.. We were both amazed how it helped her hair to look great. Also buy the conditioner.. last forever.</li>
    <li> I am useing this product over last two year and help me lot . Stop loosing hair and looks healthy hair</li>
    <li> It smells good too!!!  Great stimulate for the scalp and moisturizes the hair at the same time..  Can&#x27;t do without my Scalp Therapy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what was in this bottle but it was not Nioxin. The packaging is not from the company, this is a complete fake. I&#x27;m just happy I still have hair on my head</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the reviews I&#x27;ve read.  This is the same formula that I have always used, and previously purchased through my hairdresser, and at Ulta for a lot more money!</li>
    <li> I used this product for a while and found that my face, neck, and ears began to burn and turn red.  I stopped using it weeks ago, but I still am suffering from itching and burning on my face, neck, and ears.  I regret ever having used this product.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> have used this product off and on, and like the results from it.  Use to buy it from my hair dresser, but now can order it here.</li>
    <li> I have used Nioxin shampoo and Scalp Therapy for almost 10 years.  Thinning hair runs in my family, both men and women, and I have the thickest hair out of all of my family members.  It doesn&#x27;t make hair grow back, but it seems to help protect the hair that you have.  It also gives your hair wonderful body.  I love the product and won&#x27;t use anything else.  I highly recommend it to anyone with thinning hair or scalp problems.</li>
    <li> Very good product, works well, good for everyday use. Affordable as you don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
    <li> Love the product and so much cheaper than the salon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recommended scalp therapy to several people and they all agreed that it really helps. I was convinced it works because I never went bald during chemo 13 years ago. I was told I would. My hair did thin but I didn&#x27;t lose it all.</li>
    <li> I always seemed to lose a lot of hair when shampooing. I noticed a HUGE difference when I switched to Nioxin. I lost a lot less hair. I&#x27;m not balding or anything. I just have fine, thin hair. With the condition, it leaves my hair feeling silkier than any other products I&#x27;ve ever used. This is a must have product for me.</li>
    <li> Used the product for years but have never had a better experience purchasing it than right here.  My hair grows</li>
    <li> I have used this for a number of years and it really works for me. Stopped my hair from falling out and actually began growing again.The price is so much lower than buying locally.</li>
    <li> I was told takes awhile help hair grow in .........been using it few months no change. Dont order number 3 it is for color treated hair it has pppermint fragrance to it and burns your eyes while in shower and still after rinsed off . .......burns my  eyes</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding shampoo and conditioner that does not damage my hair or my scalp, I have used this product for 2 years now and I will never use another!</li>
    <li> My hair started thinning on top.  I started using the Nioxin shampoo and condition (sys 3 for color treated hair) and I noticed new growth within a month.  Hair grows about 1/2&amp;#34; a month.  After 3 months, my new hair was an inch and a half long!</li>
    <li> I immediately saw a difference when I began using this. I had a bald spot on the back of my head where I was wearing my up in a clip everyday. My stylist recommended this and it worked great. The smell isn&#x27;t great, but I use products afterward (it smells minty). I haven&#x27;t stopped using it, but my hair stays thicker and less oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin for many years.  I actually had balding at the crown of my head, and it&#x27;s totally gone due to continual use of Nioxin.  It&#x27;s the only shampoo and conditioner I would use!</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Love the product!</li>
    <li> It works well as a conditioner and leaves your scalp feeling revitalized. I&#x27;ve tried many different types, but seem to always return to Nioxin Scalp Therapy.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Nioxin system of 3 products for about 6 years. It was recommended by the woman who cuts my hair. It works great in that it has really lowered the number of hairs I lose every day.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for awhile. Has helped my hair look and feel fuller and healther. More body and more manageability.</li>
    <li> Bought the nioxin system 3 cleanser &amp; Scalp Thearapy  conditioner duo. Always running out of conditioner , was glad that could purchase the conditioner alone.. Great product..</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years!  I use both the shampoo and conditioner!! It has really help my hair loss come to an end!!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> This product is working very well for my hair.  My hair seems thicker immediately and new growth is evident as well.</li>
    <li> Always a great deal for this shampoo. Best deal available! Love being able to purchase at this great price. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell whether or not this product is actually helping with my hair loss because I am using 2 different products that are supposed to help regrow hair.  With that said, I love the way my hair feels after using this product - it makes my hair soft and strong feeling, and I think I see less hairs in my bathroom (though again, I am using 2 other products).  It may not work miracles for hair loss, but I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product,&lt;br /&gt;my daughter and I have OILY, FLAKEY hair&lt;br /&gt;This product controls the oil for 2 days for us and calms the flakes by well over 1/2!!&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t found any other product that can do that for us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to all my friends and both of my sisters have purchased it as well and are loving it!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Works with shampoo.  I always need twice the amount conditioner as I buy shampoo, no matter what type.  Gives more body.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I been using for years.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several years along with their shampoo and I think it is helping slow down the hair thinning as I get older.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for thin hair ,I&#x27;ve been using it for four years.  It improved condition of my hair noticeably.  I was delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> I have used Nioxin products for many years. This is great if you use hair color. It does NOT make your hair limp, helps with hair health, and gives it body.</li>
    <li> Several years ago I underwent two CAT scans just four days apart when I was in the hospital following an injury.  Afterwards, most of my hair fell out - possibly from excess radiation. As the time approached for me to return to work I went to a salon to see if they could do something with my hair that was in the process of slowly, unevenly growing back.  They recommended Nioxin Scalp Therapy and told me it is often recommended to cancer patients who have undergone radiation therapy.  So I purchased a bottle and tried it.  The conditioner is very thick and rich and does a great job of moisturizing your hair especially if it is applied after washing your hair with the companion shampoo product that thoroughly cleans the scalp [[ASIN:B000F4GIP2 Nioxin Cleanser, System 3 (Fine/Treated/Normal to Thin-Looking), 33.8 Ounce]].  I later discovered I could order the product from Amazon and pay less than half of the salon cost for the product.  I have ordered from Amazon ever since.</li>
    <li> I have very fine baby hair, which has only gotten finer as I have aged. I needed a little help to at least have it look full again.  This shampoo has helped. It smells like mint and feels good on scalp. I like it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin since I lost my hair during chemotherapy treatment.  I&#x27;m so glad I can get it without having to search salon after salon.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nioxin for 3 years. Its expensive in Hawaii, and this product was a great deal for the price!</li>
    <li> While the smell is a bit strong I can tell a difference in my hair. I&#x27;ve got the fine, flyaway type hair and I&#x27;ve always had a shedding problem.  I&#x27;ve got plenty of it but hate having to constantly brush my clothes. This product has slowed that down and my hair looks good.</li>
    <li> This is a great product...as usual. I don&#x27;t really have a problem with hair loss, but I hate all the hair that falls out around the house, in my bed, down the drain...etc. This actually helps with that...A LOT. Great deal too...it is at least twice as much if you buy it at the local salon or beauty supply store!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. Getting the big bottle will last me much longer! Price is decent. Thanks</li>
    <li> Good Product with fast shipping</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past.  It really feel great on your scalp.  My hair feel fuller.  I like it.</li>
    <li> I have used the Nioxin shampoo and conditioner ever since one of my hair dressers recommended it to me for my thinning hair.  It works very well as a conditioner to allow me to comb through my hair with less tangles.  I&#x27;m on the fence, though, when it comes to actually saying it makes my hair thicker.  A friend asked me if it worked, and I had to tell her that I really didn&#x27;t know.  What would my hair be like if I didn&#x27;t use this product?  There really isn&#x27;t a way for me to be sure if this product helps thicken my hair or not.  I go through hair loss cycles from time to time related to excess stress, or sometimes related to the physical challenges of recovering from surgeries.  I keep using the Nioxin products, even though they are kind of pricey (but a lot less money on Amazon than purchasing these products at a salon), but only because I do not want to risk what my hair might be like if I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This is still Nioxin Scalp Therapy, which I love, but it seems to be seriously watered down. I&#x27;ve never seen it so thin,I&#x27;m using twice as much product, so there really isn&#x27;t much, if any cost savings.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years which I used to buy through my salon.  I was glad to be able to find the same good product on Amazon.  Nioxin Scalp Therapy does the job and I will continue to use it for many more years.</li>
    <li> Size and price of this item was exceptional. Love all the Nioxin products, have seen a big difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo251UQ4UZQ07DV]]There have been some recent reviews questioning the authenticity of the latest shipments of Nioxin Scalp Therapy System. Having used Nioxin for about a year now, I was surprised when my latest bottle arrived from Amazon because it looked distinctly different. At first I thought the label must&#x27;ve just been redesigned but then I read some reviews questioning whether they received an imitation so I did a little investigation. This video shows a clear difference between my old bottle and the new replacement. It did seem odd that this product is now made in Mexico and that the ingredients were very different. I called both 1-800 numbers listed on the different bottles (yes, the 1-800 numbers were also different) but they actually go to the same Nioxin line. I also tried to look up information on Nioxin&#x27;s website. They are depicting all bottles with the black cap, which is the new reformulated line. There&#x27;s a chat feature available but there were no available representative at the time I tried to chat online so I couldn&#x27;t get a confirmation of whether or not Nioxin has in fact been reformulated. But from what I can tell, it probably has been. I also noticed that the new bottle no longer states that they do not test on animals so if you&#x27;re conscientious about that, do take note. I think Amazon should update their picture of the product so that people don&#x27;t get confused. So far, I&#x27;ve not had any problems using this so I will give this new reformulated product 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Early delivery. Everything intact.</li>
    <li> I have used it for several years. This was a very good buy.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly.  As expected.</li>
    <li> Well I can finely say I&#x27;ve found a conditioner that helped my scalp! I&#x27;ve never had severely dry skin but I tackle that with potent natural lotions. My scalp is a different story. Every winter I get dry scalp. Nothing too inconvenient and it never really looked like I had dandruff as it was just slightly dry but I didn&#x27;t want to take the chance for it to get worse. I have tried head and shoulders products and they worked to some degree but never got RID of my dry scalp. I even did homemade essential oil + olive oil treatments to help maintain my scalps PH balance and washed my hair every other day or every 3 days, making sure I used a little dry shampoo so my hair didn&#x27;t look greasy. It helped, but again, did not cure my dry scalp. The first time I used this I put it on and left it on for 3 minutes in the shower, while I shaved my legs. I use FEEL it cooling my scalp. It didn&#x27;t burn or irritate my head, it just felt good. After a few uses I noticed I had zero dry patches and no flakes AT ALL! My hair also felt amazingly silky! More so than normal. I use regular shampoo but finish with this conditioner. It works great!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 15 years now.  I like its intense mintiness, but love how gentle it is on my color-treated hair.  Amazon often has pretty good prices on this product.</li>
    <li> Good product and fast shipping! I will order again!</li>
    <li> Love this product, have notice small hairs coming in and overall texture is better.</li>
    <li> Really helping my hair.</li>
    <li> love this product. gives body and shine. excellent for thin hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nioxin Scalp Therapy, System 3 for almost a year and have purchased it both at Ulta and through amazon.com. This last bottle is distinctly different and I wonder if it is not the genuine product. The plastic of the bottle is much thinner and the product itself is far more watery. After using it a few times, my hair feels drier an less healthy. So this review is of this particular shipment and not the product in general.</li>
    <li> This not only helps your hair grow but prevents baldness in older women. I wouldn&#x27;t use any other shampoo in the world.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nixon products fro a very long time. I love love love them. I think they are everything and more they say they are. I would recommend Nioxin Scalp therapy and all their products.</li>
    <li> This works well for my  hair and helps it behave itself.  Otherwise my hair has a mind of its own.</li>
    <li> Love this for my fine hair!</li>
    <li> This seems to help me a little bit with my shedding but not significantly. It does not thicken my hair like other people have mentioned. I&#x27;m glad I tried it (along w/ the shampoo) but won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I don&#x27;t even care if it&#x27;s actually making my hair fuller. The minty, tingly sensations alone makes this product worth every single penny. What an invigorating way to start the morning!</li>
