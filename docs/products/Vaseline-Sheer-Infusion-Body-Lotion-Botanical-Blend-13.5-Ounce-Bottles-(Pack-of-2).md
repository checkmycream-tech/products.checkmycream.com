### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>But its not so wonderful that I wouldn&#x27;t buy a competing product if it were cheaper.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Personally though, even if the lotion itself were perfect, I would not buy again because it is just too scented.</li>
      <li>It works great as a hand lotion.  </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>In reality, they are virtually identical and pleasantly so.  </li>
      <li>So for me, even though the lotion is good, the scent will keep me from buying it again.</li>
      <li>I have had a good experience with this product.</li>
      <li>I liked the scent alot and the thickness of the product was great.</li>
      <li>This is good lotion, however, it has a very potent lingering fragrance.  </li>
      <li>All three fragrances that Vaseline makes of this lotion are very potent.  </li>
      <li>The protection is quite good, with a nice feel on the skin.  </li>
      <li>Leaves her skin feeling silky smooth!!</li>
      <li>and then she stopped and said &#x27;you feel amazing,  what moisturizer are you using?&#x27;  </li>
      <li>any rate, I use this on my legs after I shave, and it works nicely -- though not as nicely as the [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>The scent is nice, not over-done.</li>
      <li>This has a nice scent.</li>
      <li>she can buy her own...  </li>
      <li>Still, if that doesn&#x27;t matter to you, it does do a nice job of keeping skin hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent is nice, and not too feminine.  </li>
      <li>This lotion would not be good if you have allergies, are around someone who has allergies, don&#x27;t love the scent and wish to smell like this lotion all day, or want to put on perfume or cologne.  </li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s sitting on your skin,  and has a pleasant,  not too strong scent.  </li>
      <li>Very pleasant smell, very creamy, and does the job.  </li>
      <li>The addition of parabens (used as preservatives) is sometimes controversial in the cosmetics industry.  </li>
      <li>Ironically, the moisturizing is so good that it doesn&#x27;t wash off quickly.   </li>
      <li>I love body lotions and oils.  </li>
      <li>I have found, however, that the lotion is just oily enough to cause some stickiness on legs and arms; so that I am finding its best use is not as a body lotion, as it is billed, but more so as a face cream.</li>
      <li>This is nice lotion with a light scent.  </li>
      <li>Glycerin is hygroscopic, meaning it attracts water, and glycerol quat is a compound supposed to attract and hold more water than glycerin.  </li>
      <li>I will say that I feel smoother,  but I am also using the steam room at the gym a lot more,  and</li>
      <li>I love the smell and the way my hands feel instantly smooth!</li>
      <li>Whether it works better or not might require microscopic examination.  </li>
      <li>Will order this for sure.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed using it a lot.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not wholly convinced that it is actually a better product.  </li>
      <li>I love it and do plan on buying more.</li>
      <li>I like the nice, light scent of this product.  </li>
      <li>The botanical blend is mostly floral, with a hint of a eucalyptus fragrance.</li>
      <li>It smells like most perfumed lotions (think VSC&#x27;s perfumed lotions).It is not as emollient as another type of Vaseline product.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant smell, goes on easily, absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>It smells nice, clean.  </li>
      <li>A good product certainly,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Vaseline products but not so much their fragrance.</li>
      <li>The bottle is a generous 13 1/2 ounces and the pump is easy to use and hasn&#x27;t become clogged.  </li>
      <li>It goes on easily,  and passes the &#x27;scratch test&#x27;</li>
      <li>This Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion smoothes on beautifully, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy afterwards.  </li>
      <li>and this really helps to keep my hands hydrated, healthy and crack-free.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>This body lotion keeps my skin supple and feeling great-- the longer its used, the better my very dry skin feels.  </li>
      <li>The lotion has almost a talcy feel once applied, and it has a light, scarcely discernable floral scent.</li>
      <li>This lotion goes on smoothly, and it doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy.</li>
      <li>The major claim is that their new formula \\&quot;Stratys 3\\&quot; provides the best combination of moisturizers on the market, leaving your skin hydrated, but not sticky.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know that it is markedly better than other Vaseline products,  but as Vaseline is an excellent brand name with consistently high standards,  that&#x27;s no insult!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s somewhat pleasant, but it is just a shade stronger than I generally prefer.  </li>
      <li>However, shifts in weather as well as a more frequent than normal need to wash dishes by hand has made this product welcome.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion very much.  </li>
      <li>This is a lotion I would not use in warm climates or during high temperatures because of the scent.</li>
      <li>Sheer Infustion, Botanical Blend is very good for most people I am sure, but I have extremely dry skin</li>
      <li>When using it after a shower, it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>But its nice, and it leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>This is a light, mildly fragranced lotion that spreads easily and leaves a fresh, clean feel on the skin.</li>
      <li>Because of the strong fragrance I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good for very sensitive or broken/irritated skin, but for an everyday lotion, if you like a strong fragrance, this is a good choice.</li>
      <li>It even made my elbows nice and soft!</li>
      <li>It is very smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel very oily.  </li>
      <li>and though this works for me well most of the time, not so much for winter when my skin is at it driest.</li>
      <li>The scent is on the sweet side and does have a sort of herbal/plant note to it.  </li>
      <li>But it leaves my skin with a soft kind of glowy look.  </li>
      <li>The botanical scent is light and unoffensive, but strong enough that you will not be able to wear perfume.  </li>
      <li>It rubbed in quickly and didn&#x27;t give you a tacky feeling.</li>
      <li>The scent is quite strong, and it stays with you throughout the day, so if you&#x27;re sensitive to different kinds of smells or need an unscented or only lightly scented lotion, this one wouldn&#x27;t be the best choice.</li>
      <li>To be fair, almost any moisturizing lotion will do the trick; but the two \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; of Vaseline Sheer Infusion that I tried out add a bit of luxury to the process, mainly in their silken feel and making the skin feel comfortably moist.</li>
      <li>The bottle is very generously sized and has an easy to grip design.</li>
      <li>Vasoline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion is an outstanding product!</li>
      <li>Too many lotions become a greasy mess, but this absorbs nicely into skin.  </li>
      <li>It has a pleasant herbal scent with a hint of floral, and even if it seems a little greasy when it first goes on, it absorbs very quickly so that doesn&#x27;t become an issue.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice that much of a difference alternating with my cheap Suave lotion.  </li>
      <li>This lotion is quite light, but moisturizes very well.</li>
      <li>, it only has a light fragrance and might be a better choice if you don&#x27;t like a lot of scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for the past two weeks and have been impressed by how easily it absorbs into my skin</li>
      <li>the Sheer Infusions is a rich,  but not too rich moisturizer,  that goes on easily,  </li>
      <li>The results were good, but not anything well beyond other lotions that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>Moisturizing is a good thing - one of the few things one can do to keep skin looking young and healthy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is not a bad scent, but unless you really like this scent and want to wear it as a perfume substitute, it&#x27;s just too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Vaseline&#x27;s Sheer Infusion Botanical Blend Body Lotion is a nice all-purpose lotion, but it didn&#x27;t really rock my socks off.</li>
      <li>this one I like very much.  </li>
      <li>So, what exactly is \\&quot;Stratys 3\\&quot;?  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll check with my husband next :)  </li>
      <li>In hot climates, this scent would attract insects.</li>
      <li>I have found that a light coat offers a soothing feeling and helps me avoid chapping.</li>
      <li>It works as a body lotion, but if you tend to also use lotions as a hand lotion, this would not be my first choice.</li>
      <li>But its something to be aware of if it concerns you.  </li>
      <li>I would certainly consider this product worth trying for anyone who needs a body lotion, but I&#x27;d probably recommend trying a few products at a lower price point first to see if you can get good results for your needs without spending quite as much.</li>
      <li>I would buy again,  but if it was hard to find or much pricier,  I would be happy to stay with the Aloe</li>
      <li>The advertising kind of dumbs it all down for us by saying it moisturizes \\&quot;the top, the core, and deep down\\</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pricey and you can get a better lotion for less money and more natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>Vaseline advertises that this particular trio, when used together work better than each works individually.  </li>
      <li>Would NEVER use it on large areas like legs or arms.  </li>
      <li>I wish they made this in unscented or a very light scent (and I do mean light).  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>The floral scent lingers, light enough not to be overpowering.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how much better it is than the Aloe Fresh (same brand) which I use regularly.  </li>
      <li>This smells heavenly and is very moisturising.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I found that this lotion did a pretty good job of moisturizing with just a bit of greasiness left behind once it was absorbed (which is pretty typical of lotions that try to do heavy moisturizing).  The scent is on the sweet side and does have a sort of herbal/plant note to it.  It&#x27;s somewhat pleasant, but it is just a shade stronger than I generally prefer.  Your experience with the scent may vary, since scents often change a bit based on the skin of the person who&#x27;s wearing them.    The results were good, but not anything well beyond other lotions that I&#x27;ve used.  I would certainly consider this product worth trying for anyone who needs a body lotion, but I&#x27;d probably recommend trying a few products at a lower price point first to see if you can get good results for your needs without spending quite as much.</li>
    <li> I have not previously been a fan of Vaseline Intensive Care lotions -- this one I like very much.  I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for the past two weeks and have been impressed by how easily it absorbs into my skin (winter dry skin at this point!) and, especially, how it lasts through the day.  I do not usually buy scented lotions but, at least with my body chemistry, the light and pleasant scent was neither cloying nor particularly noticeable after ten minutes or so.  Only a small amount of lotion is necessary -- a feature I like -- and the feel is neither greasy nor thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;m not sure about, though, is whether it is particularly better than other lotions at a lower price.  I suspect this will become a matter of personal preference -- those who dislike or are particularly sensitive to scents may not like this lotion.  Other reviews of this product seem to suggest that the lotion is too thick -- not my experience -- but again, I only use a small amount each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the reader thinking about buying this lotion, I&#x27;d recommend trying it.  I like it very much and will purchase when I see it at a lower price than my usual lotion.</li>
    <li> Sheer Infustion, Botanical Blend is very good for most people I am sure, but I have extremely dry skin and though this works for me well most of the time, not so much for winter when my skin is at it driest. I found the feel of it silky and the smell of it nice, not strong or over powering. It rubbed in quickly and didn&#x27;t give you a tacky feeling. Just not enough to alieviate the burning feeling my skin has during the heating season of cold Minnesota winter days when the climate is at its driest.</li>
    <li> Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion, Botanical Blend is the newest release in the Vaseline Intensive Care family of moisturizers.  The major claim is that their new formula \\&quot;Stratys 3\\&quot; provides the best combination of moisturizers on the market, leaving your skin hydrated, but not sticky.  So, what exactly is \\&quot;Stratys 3\\&quot;?  A combination of glycerol quat, hydroxyethyl urea, and glycerin.  Glycerin is hygroscopic, meaning it attracts water, and glycerol quat is a compound supposed to attract and hold more water than glycerin.  Hydroxyethyl urea sometimes competes with glycerine for moisturizing effectiveness in the cosmetics market, but is thought to be less sticky.  Vaseline advertises that this particular trio, when used together work better than each works individually.  The advertising kind of dumbs it all down for us by saying it moisturizes \\&quot;the top, the core, and deep down\\&quot; parts of our skin.  The general idea is to attract and hold water in the skin, which this product seems to do.    Extra added benefits:  Vitamin B-5 and Vitamin E.  Both linked with improved moisturizing , but without knowing the amounts added here, can&#x27;t even tell if they are just added fluff, or truly in sufficient quantities to do anything.   When using it after a shower, it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  The leg I&#x27;ve applied it to looks and feels better than the other one immediately, and still does at the end of the day.  It has staying power.    After using it for a few weeks (and using it on both legs, that experiment was annoying) I can say it works as well as any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried.  Whether it works better or not might require microscopic examination.  The scent is nice, and not too feminine.  Guys could use it without smelling girly.  However, that said, scent is a personal thing and the Botanical Blend has enough of a scent that you should smell it before using it.  The downside?  Again, back to the scent.  Anyone with allergies, or a sensitive nose would not appreciate it.  Also it might compete with your other scents and perfumes.  The addition of parabens (used as preservatives) is sometimes controversial in the cosmetics industry.  They have been linked with breast cancer in women and decreased sperm count in men.  However, the amounts in this lotion are extremely small and in my opinion, negligible.  But its something to be aware of if it concerns you.  Overall?  I like it.  But its not so wonderful that I wouldn&#x27;t buy a competing product if it were cheaper.  I&#x27;m not wholly convinced that it is actually a better product.  But its nice, and it leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This scent is overpowering.  It is not a situation of, yes, you can tell it&#x27;s there.  I mean, this is a very strong scent.  I would go so far as to call it overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a bad scent, but unless you really like this scent and want to wear it as a perfume substitute, it&#x27;s just too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the lotion itself, I found it in line with other vaseline products.  It&#x27;s not completely sheer, it is a touch on the greasy side, I would not wear it in summer.  Still, if that doesn&#x27;t matter to you, it does do a nice job of keeping skin hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally though, even if the lotion itself were perfect, I would not buy again because it is just too scented.</li>
    <li> This lotion absorbs without leaving a greasy feeling on your hands, etc. Keeps skin feeling soft without being tacky. My wife commented that she likes it as well. It has a pleasant smell, goes on easily, absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Vaseline&#x27;s skin products are usually reliable, and Sheer Infusion is no exception. This is a light, mildly fragranced lotion that spreads easily and leaves a fresh, clean feel on the skin. When my current supply runs out, I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This product leaves skin silky without oily residue.  Too many lotions become a greasy mess, but this absorbs nicely into skin.  I&#x27;ve seen a big improvement just in the first day.</li>
    <li> This has a nice scent. And it is listed as a body lotion.  It works as a body lotion, but if you tend to also use lotions as a hand lotion, this would not be my first choice. It leaves a bit of residue which I  would not recommend for hands.  Water is the first ingredient and glycerin the second, so it may provide enough moisture for a day, but in dry areas or dry skin, it needs re-application. This is a lotion I would not use in warm climates or during high temperatures because of the scent. In hot climates, this scent would attract insects. The floral scent lingers, light enough not to be overpowering. It smells like most perfumed lotions (think VSC&#x27;s perfumed lotions).It is not as emollient as another type of Vaseline product.</li>
    <li> Vaseline&#x27;s Sheer Infusion Botanical Blend Body Lotion is a nice all-purpose lotion, but it didn&#x27;t really rock my socks off. It&#x27;s not as thick and creamy as I generally prefer my lotions, though it is fairly non-greasy. The scent is somewhat herbal -- almost reminds me of an Aveda product, though not quite as cloying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I use this on my legs after I shave, and it works nicely -- though not as nicely as the [[ASIN:B001KYTSAI Vaseline Intensive Rescue Clinical Therapy Skin Protectant Body Lotion, Unfragranced 6.8 fl oz (200]]. I don&#x27;t think the Sheer Infusion is quite thick or moisturizing enough for really heavy-duty work, though (like super-dry winter skin or hands).</li>
    <li> Very pleasant smell, very creamy, and does the job.  A little goes a long way.  Will order this for sure.</li>
    <li> I am not usually one to apply hand lotion, because I handle a lot of media and have wariness of leaving traces of lotion on pages and other surfaces. However, shifts in weather as well as a more frequent than normal need to wash dishes by hand has made this product welcome. I have found that a light coat offers a soothing feeling and helps me avoid chapping. The lotion has almost a talcy feel once applied, and it has a light, scarcely discernable floral scent. I did not experience the tackiness I often associate with hand lotions. I have had a good experience with this product.</li>
    <li> This lotion gets it done. I belive that is the reason it&#x27;s no longer made. Immediate lasting relief from dry skin.</li>
    <li> So far I have tried 2 scents in the Sheer Illusion series, Vitamin Burst and Botanical Blend.  Unfortunately, Botanical Blend has an overpowering scent that makes it almost impossible to use.    The scent is very similar to some Avon \\&quot;protecting\\&quot; lotion I got as a gift back in the early 1990s. I&#x27;m convinced that the \\&quot;Stratys 3\\&quot; protection Vaseline uses is the same thing. It&#x27;s very unpleasant, kind of glue-like, and while the Vitamin Burst type is usable, the Botanical Blend scent is so strong (probably because they were trying to mask the glue-ish smell) that I just cannot use it.  My eyes watered, my allergies started to act up, and I tried to wash it off.  Ironically, the moisturizing is so good that it doesn&#x27;t wash off quickly.   The protection is quite good, with a nice feel on the skin.  That&#x27;s the reason I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars.  Scent is subjective and some people may not mind the scent.</li>
    <li> This is nice lotion with a light scent.  It isn&#x27;t too greasy and seems to last quite a while during the day.  My skin did feel silky and I enjoyed using it a lot.  I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the price though.  I didn&#x27;t notice that much of a difference alternating with my cheap Suave lotion.  A good product certainly, but I can&#x27;t justify the price.</li>
    <li> This lotion goes on smoothly, and it doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy. It spreads easily, and if anything it&#x27;s actually a bit thin, and a couple of pumps can really go a long way. The scent is quite strong, and it stays with you throughout the day, so if you&#x27;re sensitive to different kinds of smells or need an unscented or only lightly scented lotion, this one wouldn&#x27;t be the best choice. I actually really like the vaseline intensive therapy lotion, it only has a light fragrance and might be a better choice if you don&#x27;t like a lot of scent. The botanical blend is mostly floral, with a hint of a eucalyptus fragrance. I did notice that it softened my skin really well, and after using it for several days in a row my skin was smoother and softer than before. Because of the strong fragrance I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good for very sensitive or broken/irritated skin, but for an everyday lotion, if you like a strong fragrance, this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> This lotion is quite light, but moisturizes very well. It has no strong perfumes that might compete with other fragrances you might where. It is sheer, absorbs quickly, and is not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I really like Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion, Botanical Blend.  The scent is light and fragrant, but not overwhelming, and the lotion just seems to sink right into my skin without a greasy after feel.  I have found that in the past few weeks that I have used it, my skin has become softer and the dryness I usually have has gone away.  The bottle is a generous 13 1/2 ounces and the pump is easy to use and hasn&#x27;t become clogged.  My only problem is that the price is a little high, but, frankly, if this great lotion continues to perform as well as it has, I&#x27;ll continue to use it.  It even made my elbows nice and soft!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a reasonably-priced body lotion like this for about 2 years now.  Vaseline really has delivered a product that does what it says it will do.  This body lotion keeps my skin supple and feeling great-- the longer its used, the better my very dry skin feels.  The scent is nice, not over-done. I don&#x27;t find it too strong or overpowering at all, compared to other lotions.      I have had any \\&quot;sticky residue\\&quot; or other similar issues that other reviewers mention.  But I have *VERY* dry skin, and this product solves that problem very very well.     I&#x27;ve even gone out &amp; purchased another bottle already.  There are several scents in this line, none seems to be bad or unsuitable for those with allergies/sensitive skin.    Great product.</li>
    <li> This lotion leaves an odd greasy build-up.  I felt like I always wanted to wash my hands after using it.  It smells nice, clean.  But isn&#x27;t particularly soothing or long-lasting.  Would NEVER use it on large areas like legs or arms.  Too greasy and \\&quot;coating\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product from the Amazon Vine program. While it was moisturizing, I can&#x27;t say that I am a 100% fan of this product. The lotion itself is thick and has a slight hint of a smell between fruity and flowery. I liked the scent alot and the thickness of the product was great. It felt closer to a thick whip than it did lotion. The bottle is very generously sized and has an easy to grip design. The base is also rather sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this item four stars because of one small problem I had with it. Like I said, it moisturized rather well and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue on my skin. It did, however, leave a stick one. After applying to my arms, I waited a few hours to see what would happen. Hours later, when I removed my sweater, my arm had collected all the lint and fuzz in the fabric and it was stuck to my arm. When I ran my fingers over my skin, there was a definite stickiness to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all: 4 out of 5 stars. Four for bottle design, thickness of the lotion, ability to moisturize and ease of use. One star deducted for the sticky residue.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion very much.  It is very smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel very oily.  It absorbs well into the skin.  I generally only use it on my legs after shaving.  Other lotions I have tried leave my legs feeling very oily, like suntan lotion, but this just moisturizes without going overboard.</li>
    <li> This offers some powerful moisturizing.  I have dry hands from working outside and they take a beating with the extreme temps (especially right now, winter) and this really helps to keep my hands hydrated, healthy and crack-free.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My big problem in the winter months is dry skin on my soles and backs of my hands.  This lotion seems like it will do the trick in keeping my skin well-hydrated.  It has a pleasant herbal scent with a hint of floral, and even if it seems a little greasy when it first goes on, it absorbs very quickly so that doesn&#x27;t become an issue.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use moisturizers a lot,  and usually have one or two on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now I can compare the Vaseline Sheer Infusion with my nameless gym moisturizer and with Vaseline Aloe Fresh Hydrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say Sheer Infusion is less tacky than the one at the gym, and it has a gentle,  inoffensive scent.  It goes on easily,  and passes the &#x27;scratch test&#x27; (scratch yourself 30 mins after you&#x27;ve put on moisturizer,  if you can see a white line,  then your moisturizer isn&#x27;t strong enough).  I don&#x27;t know how much better it is than the Aloe Fresh (same brand) which I use regularly.  I will say that I feel smoother,  but I am also using the steam room at the gym a lot more,  and I think that&#x27;s having an impact too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the Sheer Infusions is a rich,  but not too rich moisturizer,  that goes on easily,  doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s sitting on your skin,  and has a pleasant,  not too strong scent.  I don&#x27;t know that it is markedly better than other Vaseline products,  but as Vaseline is an excellent brand name with consistently high standards,  that&#x27;s no insult! I would buy again,  but if it was hard to find or much pricier,  I would be happy to stay with the Aloe Fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add - I just had lunch with a girlfriend and she put her hand on my arm to make some point and then she stopped and said &#x27;you feel amazing,  what moisturizer are you using?&#x27;  and I had to say Vaseline,  but a new fancy one!  That doesn&#x27;t happen to me often,  so clearly the lotion is making an impact.  I&#x27;ll check with my husband next :)  I also sent her this link,  so she can buy her own...  So I added a star and will def buy again.</li>
    <li> I love body lotions and oils.  I have dry skin, and after a shower I always apply something to make sure my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight and scratchy.  This Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion smoothes on beautifully, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy afterwards.  But it leaves my skin with a soft kind of glowy look.  I especially like the fragrance.  It&#x27;s floral and a little like a fresh-cut lawn, but very subtle.  If I take a shower at night and put on this lotion, then by morning I can still wear a perfume and the scents do not clash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion gives me the same lasting penetrating feeling of soft skin as dry oil spray-ons, which I also love, but which often come in scents which are quite heavy and overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommended.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> From the giant Anglo-Dutch combine Unilever&#x27;s Vaseline brand come three new body lotions under a Sheer Infusion marketing title.  Two of them: Mineral Renewal and Botanical Blend, have been tested here, each being a pleasing product within an enormously crowded field of competitors.  Each comes mainly in a 13.5 ounce plastic bottle having a pump atop.  One might wonder at why those responsible for the product&#x27;s distribution would opt for its claims and ingredients being printed in small black letters upon a dark blue background, therewith making the reading of this material very difficult.  The products do have identical content except for fragrance, where the Botanical Blend item offers eucalyptus and cypress tones.  In reality, they are virtually identical and pleasantly so.  Following several weeks of usage, it can be stated by this reviewer that each does its job of moisturing quite well.  However, with literally many hundreds of other body lotions available, it would be very difficult indeed to state that they are better than most competitors.  However, based upon such factors as the ease of absorption into troublesome dry areas such as elbows and knees, and a tendency for the texture to remain non-runny, these can be recommended for most individuals.</li>
    <li> This is good lotion, however, it has a very potent lingering fragrance.  All three fragrances that Vaseline makes of this lotion are very potent.  I wish they made this in unscented or a very light scent (and I do mean light).  Also, don&#x27;t put this lotion on thinking the scent will go away after a little bit because it doesn&#x27;t.  This lotion would not be good if you have allergies, are around someone who has allergies, don&#x27;t love the scent and wish to smell like this lotion all day, or want to put on perfume or cologne.  So for me, even though the lotion is good, the scent will keep me from buying it again.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the way my hands feel instantly smooth! I bought a 2-pack (13.5 oz each)@ BJs Wholesale Club for almost half the price...I kept one and gave one to my 75 year old grandma and she loves it! Leaves her skin feeling silky smooth!!</li>
    <li> Moisturizing is a good thing - one of the few things one can do to keep skin looking young and healthy. To be fair, almost any moisturizing lotion will do the trick; but the two \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; of Vaseline Sheer Infusion that I tried out add a bit of luxury to the process, mainly in their silken feel and making the skin feel comfortably moist. The fragrance is not overwhelming, leaning more toward the fresh smells of nature than of perfume, albeit still a bit artificial--I&#x27;d really rather do without scent altogether. In spite of the presence of eucalyptus and cypress bark in the botanical-blend version, I could not discern much difference in the scent between the two; and the two versions share the same list of most active ingredients. If you&#x27;re a fan of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products, I&#x27;d suggest the botanical-blend; the \\&quot;mineral renewal\\&quot; formula doesn&#x27;t seem to have much to distinguish it, other than mineral water (which could mean almost anything).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product over an extended time since my initial review, I can add that it actually seems to have smoothed my skin and given it a healthier feel, especially my face. I have found, however, that the lotion is just oily enough to cause some stickiness on legs and arms; so that I am finding its best use is not as a body lotion, as it is billed, but more so as a face cream.</li>
    <li> Vasoline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion is an outstanding product! Daily use produces revitalized skin. Highly recommended! Order it NOW!!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Vaseline products but not so much their fragrance. This smells heavenly and is very moisturising. I have dry skin so I didn&#x27;t feel it being greasy at all. I love it and do plan on buying more.</li>
    <li> The botanical scent is light and unoffensive, but strong enough that you will not be able to wear perfume.  I found a little of this lotion went a long way. It leaves a \\&quot;layer\\&quot; on your skin which I don&#x27;t like.  You know how you can put on a lotion and it absorbs into your skin and you feel your skin?  This is not that lotion.  You&#x27;ll feel the lotion.  I feel for a Vaseline product it&#x27;s pricey and you can get a better lotion for less money and more natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I like the nice, light scent of this product.  It works great as a hand lotion.  It is not greasy.  I would have have given this 5 stars if not for the fact that it leaves a bit of a film--though not a greasy one.  Skin is left rather silky after use.</li>
