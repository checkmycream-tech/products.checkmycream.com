      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>It is a dignified scent, uniquely memorable, manly, and refined... a gentleman&#x27;s scent for close distances.</li>

      <li>My order came exactly as requested.</li>
      <li>RSVP has a mature, woodsy/alcohol smell that reminds me of rum and pine.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not going to blow people away; it is too classy for that.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried Kenneth Cole&#x27;s Black (bright, light, and pleasant but not enough gravity/maturity), Prada (suffocating and dark/depressing), Polo Blue (sharp, artificial, and undignified), several from YSL (all mind-numbingly nasty!!), Mont Blanc Legend (peppery and aggressive but too strong; one spray overwhelms the whole room), Exceptional (nice and balanced, a good all-arounder), Kenneth Cole&#x27;s Reaction (too much apple), Pleasures (smooth and golden but also a little lazy and soft), and several others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hesitated to order it in the new style packaging from Amazon, but finally ordered one bottle to compare it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As a user of RSVP for the last 9 years, I can say that the new packaging scent is the same as the old brownish container.</li>

<li> question is--is the RSVP in the black bottle the SAME scent as the amber-colored bottles???</li>
<li> RSVP has gotten me the most complements of any cologne I have purchased, so I was shocked when I heard they were discontinuing</li>
<li> I will be crushed when I can&#x27;t find it anymore...</li>
<li> It&#x27;s getting harder to find so grab it when you can.</li>
<li> Sadly, I see it is discontinued --  and very pricey in the amber-colored bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I bought this item for half off the department store price... which is where my husband suggested i buy it...</li>
<li> The first time I tried it on at a store, I thought it was awful, but then I found that it stayed in my head for days.</li>

    <li> I gave this cologne to my husband for our anniversary. It has reawakened my desire for him and has miraculously saved our doomed marriage!!!    You see, we were having troubles \\&quot;in the bedroom\\&quot;, what with me being like the Sahara, ya know? Our relationship was on the brink of collapse. Anyway, all my friends said \\&quot;go to marriage counseling\\&quot; but I said no, there has to be an easier way!    So here I came, looking for a nice cologne. I bought this RSVP stuff and now we are like porn stars. Skip the counseling and buy RSVP &amp; save yourself some money and time.</li>
    <li> My husband has been wearing RSVP for a couple years now, and I was devasted to learn from an employee at a department store that the scent has been discontinued! So I have stocked up. I will be crushed when I can&#x27;t find it anymore...it is that good!</li>
    <li> Can not believe its back, one of my favorites but after it was discontinued the price for the ones still out there went through the roof. This seem just as good if not the same as the original and at a vary good price (I got two) had complements the first time out, get it while you can.</li>
    <li> Really nice fragrance</li>
    <li> RSVP is one of my very favorite scents. The first time I tried it on at a store, I thought it was awful, but then I found that it stayed in my head for days. So I went back and tried it again, and have never looked back!! I&#x27;ve been through several of the old amber-colored bottles, and now I am down to my last one. Sadly, I see it is discontinued --  and very pricey in the amber-colored bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My question is--is the RSVP in the black bottle the SAME scent as the amber-colored bottles??? Has anyone tried it in both bottles who can comment please???  If it is the same, I&#x27;d buy it if it was in a milk carton!!!  THANKS!!!</li>
    <li> I have gotten so many compliments over the years using this cologne. however, it has been discontinued!!!!!! So you can only buy it here on Amazon</li>
