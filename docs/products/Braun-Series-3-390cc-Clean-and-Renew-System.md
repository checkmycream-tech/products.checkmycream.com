      <li>I would say definitely one of best product ever designed for men.</li>
      <li>I am using this product for more than a month now.</li>
      <li>After many attempts, I still has stubble</li>
      <li>Since I don&#x27;t have to buy and trash blades every now and then, it is good for environment also (one reason making it worth the price).</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t bother at all with the elaborate cleaning station.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used this in a year or more...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see how the Contour&#x27;s elaborate setup is a step forward.  </li>

      <li>The warning light about \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; is nice.  </li>
      <li>close, smooth and not one bit of irritation!</li>
      <li>Bought this one six months ago and have to say that I&#x27;m totally satisfied with the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>having used braun for years, i&#x27;m pleased with this one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d just as soon purchase more Fusion blades, now that my shoulder has healed from surgery.    </li>
      <li>Why spend more money on a razor when you don&#x27;t have to.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d just as soon purchase more Fusion blades, now that my shoulder has healed from surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Brush out the stubble with the brush, run it under water if it makes you feel better, and move on.  </li>
      <li>The shipping and handling were also top notch</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this is great for peachfuzz, but real men don&#x27;t have time for toys like this.  </li>
      <li>Great and highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;ll probably run it through the cleaning system at most once a week.  </li>
      <li>Everyone is right, you need to give it a good month.  </li>
      <li>If you have more money go for higher end versions but this is extremely good.</li>
      <li>Now after a about a month of use I am getting an extremely close shave and feel very happy about having switched!  </li>
      <li>The clean and renew is more of a gimmick...and can cost you if you opt to keep buying the refills from them.</li>
      <li>, had my first shave this morning and was pretty happy with it.  </li>
      <li>now its still going strong.  </li>
      <li>The battery seems very adequate and the 1 hr rating is quite accurate.</li>
      <li>I just brush out the blades from time to time...works just fine.  </li>
      <li>this shaver works fine.  </li>
      <li>My skin is as smooth as a newborn&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>but it seems to reach a point where the finer particles bring to the warning light eventually.    </li>
      <li>and you have to get refills of the cleaning chemical which does not come cheap.  </li>
      <li>Give yourself about a week to let your skin get use to your new razor and you will be very satisfied.  </li>
      <li>I cannot get the contour to leave my face clean or smooth.  </li>
      <li>I love 5 min shave every morning, the first thing I do after I wake up.</li>
      <li>This is my first shaver and I am 10000% satisfied.</li>
      <li>so far I&#x27;m very pleased with the shave.  </li>
      <li>&quot; else you will be spending significant time and effort to get it \\&quot;repaired\\&quot; by Braun.</li>
      <li>Tried shaving whith it severl times but I always have to clean up what it missed with a four blade razer.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand all these rave reviews about close, clean shaves.  </li>
      <li>I was given a Braun 390cc Clean &amp; Renew System for Christmas.</li>
      <li>You get a clean look for no effort.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use the Clean and Renew system.  </li>
      <li>In fact, if you want to save money, buy this model shaver without the C&amp;R system and just use running water to clean it.  </li>
      <li>I clean it</li>

      <li>Having to continually go over and over some spots to get them clean.</li>
      <li>My plan was to buy the Braun, use it for 30 days, return it and then give the Panasonic a try for the next 30 days, and then choose the one I liked most.</li>
      <li>It started with the battery not holding a full charge, and</li>
      <li>so you can get full power.</li>
      <li>Too cool.</li>
      <li>still use the Braun razor for convenience and it does an OK job unless I really want a close shave to impress the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product is great, my husband completely loved this shaver! From the day he got he hasn&#x27;t stopped shaving, if he could do it in his sleep he would. I would definatley recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The Braun 390CC is an excellent Razor.  Why spend more money on a razor when you don&#x27;t have to.  Give yourself about a week to let your skin get use to your new razor and you will be very satisfied.  The cleaner works very well to.  David</li>
    <li> My old shaver was a Norelco that seemed to work pretty well.  Unfortunately I lost the charger and the cost for a replacement charger was not worth it.    I picked the Braun Contour because I happened to have enough gift points to get it for free from a web service.      I don&#x27;t understand all these rave reviews about close, clean shaves.  I cannot get the contour to leave my face clean or smooth.  Frequently, I&#x27;ll see one or two lone stubbles sticking out.  I&#x27;ll frantically run the contour over and over the area to no avail.  I&#x27;ll end up resorting to tweezers.    I&#x27;ve even reconsulted the instructions to see if I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but the instructions are pretty straightforward.  My wife complains all the time about my unclean shaves.    I like the fact that the shaver can simply by rinsed under the sink but I don&#x27;t bother at all with the elaborate cleaning station.  For one thing, if you follow the exact directions, you would end up having to constantly purchase a ton of cleaning fluid.  Secondly, the cleaning station is huge.  It&#x27;s somewhat smaller than a volleyball.  I don&#x27;t have space in my bathroom (or bedroom) for this thing.    My old shaver required neither special fluid nor a massive cleaning station.  I don&#x27;t see how the Contour&#x27;s elaborate setup is a step forward.  It&#x27;s nice to see that the Contour is working for other users but it&#x27;s definitely a disappointment to me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers for more than 12 years and this would have been my 4th one, but I am disappointed.  As reported by others, it&#x27;s very hard to get a close shave.  After shaving with this one, I can still use the 7+-year-old Braun 5000 series to clean up a lot of beards this new one has missed.  On the other, the Clean light come up after 2 shaves regardless whether it really needs a clean or not.    It&#x27;s on its return trip to Braun.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 3 razor that i purchased was actually surprisingly great to use.  Cuts hairs amazingly close i don&#x27;t feel much, if any skin irritation.  My skin is usually very sensitive to my razors, electric or not.  The only downside to the this model is that some hairs on your face aren&#x27;t always facing the same direction as the others.  So after going up and down your face some side to side helps get the rest.  Having used it daily since it arrived, I find the cleaning and recharge system to be productive.  While the cleaning is loud, it does actually clean and make the razor feel like new again.   If i could purchase this product again knowing what i know, i wouldn&#x27;t.  I would simply get the better newer version Braun puts out.  They have a customer for life. :-)</li>
    <li> Shaves great!!  I&#x27;m a return Braun customer after using my previous one for a very long time.  The only thing that keeps this one from 5 stars is that the Clean &amp; Renew system has taken a step back.  My previous shaver had the 1st generation C&amp;R system &amp; it had the capability of selecting whether to just charge or just clean or both.  This one doesn&#x27;t have that capability.  It can only run through the whole clean &amp; charge cycle.  However, it&#x27;s not that big a deal since one improvement with this newer model is that I can put it under running water to quickly clean it.  So, in order to save solution, I use running water whenever it needs to be cleaned but not charged.  But, when it needs to be charged, I run it through the Clean &amp; Renew system and that works out great.  In fact, if you want to save money, buy this model shaver without the C&amp;R system and just use running water to clean it.  But, you&#x27;ll need to lubricate it ever so often.    P.S.  For those who say Braun doesn&#x27;t shave as well as Norelco.  It&#x27;s because they&#x27;re different types of shavers.  Follow the Braun instructions. The key to using Braun shavers is to not use as much pressure when shaving, especially at first or when you&#x27;re beard is longer.  Use just enough to hear it cut.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver for my birthday in April.&lt;br /&gt;I fully charged it out of the cleaning station, as recommended by the manual.&lt;br /&gt;I plugged it into its cleaning station with the cleaning fluid and the charge light was on, as supposed to happen. I happily shaved each morning. The device works for about 1 week, then the battery runs down.&lt;br /&gt;I have to remove the power cord from the cleaning station and charge the razor. After a day it is fully charged. Per the manual, the cleaning station should charge the razor when in it.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Braun on the issue and got the usual \\&quot;we&#x27;re sorry\\&quot; email but they would only say I had to take the device to an authorized dealer or ship to a nation wide repair center. I had to ship as cost/time to drive to an authorized center was cost inhibitive.&lt;br /&gt;After 1 month I got my shaver back, seemed to be fine, for a week. Battery died again. Braun&#x27;s solution, ship it again to the service center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the price of these shavers, you expect them to work correct and if they need repair the repair to be done once.&lt;br /&gt;If you purchase, pray you don&#x27;t have one of the \\&quot;bad ones\\&quot; else you will be spending significant time and effort to get it \\&quot;repaired\\&quot; by Braun. They have little regard for their quality once you buy it.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes when i bought this. Fancy package, catchy comercial how could it not work well.Gess what it does not work well. Tried shaving whith it severl times but I always have to clean up what it missed with a four blade razer. Sometimes it cuts sometimes it does not tried using technique spesified by directions and many other things.The only thing that seems to work is 90 degree against the grain and lots of pressure witchs causes lots of irritation.I have also tried 90 degree very slow or fast or soft.I have a very hard beard it may work if you have peach fuzz or a girly beard but if not it will cut very little and cause more irritation than a two blade razer.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how I did with out it before,it cuts them then washes it&#x27;s self off and dries off and is ready for another go-around the next morning. Does a good job too.</li>
    <li> this shaver works fine.  i have not used the bulky cleaning gizmo.  the charge last for about 5 days of shaving...much better than the panasonic that died after less than a year.  having used braun for years, i&#x27;m pleased with this one.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this shaver to anyone.  It&#x27;s fancy and high tech but doesn&#x27;t give a close shave and occasionally pulls a hair instead of cutting it.  Having hairs grabbed and pulled is a little painful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a few months and the only complaint I have is the battery. This seems to be the problem on all of the Braun razors I have owned (3). They start out great and give a full shave without running down. Then a couple months go by and you find yourself plugging it in so you can get full power. Other than the battery, the razor itself is great and has given me many wonderful shaves.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for both my college-age son &amp; my husband as a gift this Christmas. I have to say that they both were very skeptical - while my husband was an electric shaver, my son was not.  Both have sensitive skin and find shaving kind of a nuisance... both have beards (different lengths) and my husband a very full moustache.  They shave mainly neck and cheeks.... My son was elated with the this razor!  He previously had tried a rotary type and it really did a number on his skin and wasn&#x27;t so sure he&#x27;d even consider an electric razor. My husband had used a rotary and sometimes a regular blade to shave - again, irritated skin but had become accustomed to it after so many years... he was in the habit of applying \\&quot;aftershave\\&quot; with alcohol which he felt helped even though it burned.       Both are very pleased with this product.  The trimmer is a plus for both to keep beards neat and trim as well as the fact that it offers a close comfortable shave without so much irritation.     Thanks Braun for a great product!</li>
    <li> This is certainly as good a shaver as any I have had in the past 50  some years. Do not know what to say about the cleaning system , but   the shaver is the easiest to clean of any I have seen. I am hoping  the lubricant in the cleaner will keep it in good shape for a very  long time</li>
    <li> The shave is very good.  I&#x27;m a 20+ year user of Braun shavers and this was as good as any at shaving.  But, the reliability is poor.  Mine was originally manufactured in early 2007.  I shaved every day and placed it in the cleaner/charger each night - the lights worked normally.  But, after about two weeks I could hear the shaver slowing and then it would quit mid-shave.  I could re-charge it using the separate cord and it would be good for another couple weeks and so on.  I had it serviced under warranty and they replaced \\&quot;everything\\&quot; inside.  Well, it did exactly the same thing.     I&#x27;m actually quite sad because the newer style Braun shavers, such as Pulsonic, just don&#x27;t shave very well for me.  This model was the last to use the older style shaving head that works well for me.    89 Gator had a similar complaint.  I wished I&#x27;d listened.</li>
    <li> Hard to Get Close Shave.  I cut myself as well when trying to get a close shave.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve owned in over 15 years.  The other electric razor was a cheap Norelco I received for Christmas and I hated it because it pulled hair out more than it shaved them close to the skin.  I have a dark beard that tends to grow quickly, and so a close shave is important to me.  With a Gillette fusion power (5 blades) razor, I get the closest shave possible.  I get some minor skin irritation but I don&#x27;t know anyone that doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Braun Series 3 Clean &amp; Renew system only because I was having surgery and shaving was going to be difficult.  I thought the electric route would help.  It did.  Unfortunately, the razor hasn&#x27;t lived up to the hype and reviews I read before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I used it non-stop for a month to let my face and beard gets used to it.  Everyone is right, you need to give it a good month.  I also used people&#x27;s suggestions and purchased the Lectric Shave preshave lubricant.  This is also a big help.  Without it I didn&#x27;t get as close of a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has now been almost 5 months since I purchased it and I still don&#x27;t feel I get as close of a shave as I do with the Fusion 5-blade razor.  I even did a test last weekend where I shaved one half of my face with the Braun and the other half with the Fusion.  Immediately exiting the bathroom, I went up to my 13 year old daughter and rubbed both sides of my face on her face.  She was wondering why I was doing it, but told her why and she said that the one side was softer than the other, and one was prickly.  The soft side was the Fusion side.  By noon you could see the beard on the Braun side.  The Fusion side was still soft and smooth, and the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow didn&#x27;t show till almost 8pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use the Braun razor for convenience and it does an OK job unless I really want a close shave to impress the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second issue I have with this product is the quality of the cleaning base.  It doesn&#x27;t always keep the razor charged and I have to use the cord attached to the razor about once every two weeks to get a good full charge.  It has even fully discharged the battery three different times when I&#x27;ve only used the cleaning base for over 3 weeks.  I&#x27;ve thought about contacting support on this but I don&#x27;t know if I want to waste my time sending it in and paying for shipping and handling.  I&#x27;d just as soon purchase more Fusion blades, now that my shoulder has healed from surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this to anyone?  Maybe.  It depends on what you are looking for.  It has done its job for what I purchased it for... to aid me while I recover from shoulder surgery.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one because I don&#x27;t think it out performs other razors.  I get a much closer shave with the Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone.cord attached to the razor about once every two weeks to get a good full charge.

    <li> I love it, every time I use it it feels like new, no more cuts and it&#x27;s very safe.</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun, haven&#x27;t found anything else that gives a shave of this ease &amp; quality.  Bought this one six months ago and have to say that I&#x27;m totally satisfied with the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t remember the model that was previously used, but the 5790 Contour has longer battery life &amp; gives a closer shave.  The head gets brushed cleaned daily, solution cleaned once each week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best shaver on the market for the price.</li>
    <li> The shaver came nicely packaged, however it was broken.  I had to send it to the Braun manufacturer in San Francisco to get it fixed.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I recently had shoulder surgery on my dominant side and knew that shaving was going to be a problem.  The razor performs remarkably well.  The cleaning system works well also, and quite amazing.  The battery seems very adequate and the 1 hr rating is quite accurate.</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver for my dad about amonth ago. he was complaining about cutting his face &amp; pulling his beard  closer inspection revealed the foil had gaps &amp; holes   in it cant figure out what happened to it. went to walmart  bought a new head for it will see what happens  He&#x27;s 90 years old says he didnt drop it or anything.</li>
    <li> excellent product. best razor i ever owned. and as always, amazon vendors provided the best service.  thank you</li>
    <li> I have been a Braun electric shaving customer for about 15 years now and have been very pleased with the performance of the 4 shavers during this period. This is the first product that is inferior in my opinion. The trimmer is ineffective, the cleaning system is not as good as the previous model and the shave is not as close as earlier models....I can not recommend purchase of this unit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a variety of manual blades ever since I started shaving (about 7 years or so).  I just received the 390cc as a Christmas gift and have been using it about 2 weeks now.  Even on the first shave, I thought it gave a pretty close shave (much closer than I was expecting).  After normal everyday use, the shave is almost as close as the Fusion (non-powered) razor I was using just prior to this.  There is also less irritation on my face as opposed to a manual blade and I have pretty sensitive skin.  The cleaning system is awesome.  It can be loud at first, but it&#x27;s only for a couple of minutes.  If you&#x27;re switching over from a manual razor, this is perfect.</li>
    <li> Let me begin this review by stating the reaon for the new purchase.  My current shaver, a dated brain 5414 has been slowly dying for the past year or so.  It started with the battery not holding a full charge, and what I mean by that is the motor was not nearly as fast when on battery than when plugged in.  So, it got to the point that I need to keep it plugged in all the time to get a decent speed, and even than it still seems to be running slower.  I actually opened the unit up thinking I might be able to remove the battery and that the shaver might be a bit faster when just using the power from just the plug, but the battery appeares to be hard-wired in so I skipped that.  Anyway, given that the shaver was 6+ years old and slowing down, I decided to wait until the current foil started to chip apart to get a new shaver since putting money into the old one seemed to be a waste.  Well, that happened yeseterday, cut my face good with that bloody foil! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Man, I think I paid like 40 bucks (cdn) for my 5414 so was a bit surprised to see the prices of braun shavers these days.  Their cheapest model was around 50, but the features were taking a step back from my 5414 and it really looked cheap.  After some research and reading reviews, I decided on the contour unit as it is pretty much middle of the road in the braun lineup and matches what I am used to in features.  The more expensive units (360 etc...) seem a bit gimmicky to me to be honest. 300 bucks for a shaver, I don&#x27;t think so. I was not plannning on geting the &#x27;contour system&#x27; with the auto cleaning thingy as the refills appear to be a bit pricey and that will add up over time, however, the store I bought this at was having a sale and the system package was only about 10 dollars more than the stand alone shaver so I said what the heck. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, had my first shave this morning and was pretty happy with it.  Right away before it even touched my face I could hear the difference as the contour with its new fully charged battery sounded like it was going about 10X as fast as my aging 5414.  Basically I got the save type and quality of shave that my 5414 gave me, accept that it took fewer passes to get all the hair and with less irritation.  I&#x27;m guessing the latter point is at least partly due to the fact that I did not have to go over the same area 5 times.  Maybe their new &#x27;smart foil&#x27; design with the different shaped holes helped too, who knows?  As for the trimmer part that other reviewers have complained about, yeah, its a bit weird since you have to hold the shaver horizontally to use the trimmer (unlike the 5414), but big deal, it works.  In fact, because it is positioned that way it makes it easier to get at nose hairs.  I think somebody in another review (check the solo ones, not these ones) also complains about there being no way to &#x27;lock&#x27; the shaver.  Who cares?  The on/off button is on the side so it is not likely to be turned on by accident.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Being the first day, I have yet to try the clean&amp;renew thing.  It says in the book to use it everyday but saying that is overkill is an understatement; its an obvious attempt to get you to buy more refills.  I&#x27;m going to wait until the cleaning light on the shaver comes on to try the clean&amp;renew system, we&#x27;ll see how long that takes to come on.  I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;ll probably run it through the cleaning system at most once a week.  I mean the the foil/cutter apparently has a life of 18 months or less anyway, so what&#x27;s the point in wasting cleaning solution every day?  Brush out the stubble with the brush, run it under water if it makes you feel better, and move on.  Its kinda funny as on their website and on the box itself, one of the features is that it is fully washable, yet in the product manual it states that you should only do this when you have to and can&#x27;t use the clean&amp;renew system.  Nice job guys.  Tap water cleaning is evil, but a feature! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am going to post a follow-up to this review in a few weeks so keep an eye out for that one as I will have tried the cleaning system.  So, bottom line is its faster than my old one and I get less irritation, thumbs up!  With its silver housing, it also looks pretty cool, especially with the little blue light on the cleaning thing! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is a nice shaver and the cleaning system is very nice.  I&#x27;ve had the shaver for three months and occasionally the battery is dead when I take it out of the cleaning system.  I recharge it by directly plugging into the wall and it holds the charge for a week or so after that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Apart from the battery issue, I&#x27;m very happy with it. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I bought this product for the first time about 1 month ago.  While I really like the basic shave that the unit provides, and I also like the automatic cleaning station, you should not buy this product for 2 reasons.    1) I have bought two of these razors in the past month.  In both cases, the battery died within 2 weeks.  Whether charged directly through the cord, or as part of the cleaning station, after 2 weeks, a battery charge only provides 30-45 seconds of shaving time.  I called Braun today, and they acknowledged that they are having a problem with the batteries.  Don&#x27;t buy this product.    2) The sideburn trimmer is really poorly designed. To use it, you have to hold the whole shaver at a 90 degree angle to your face, which prevents you from being able to see if you&#x27;re going to get a straight cut.  Very bad design, and much worse than on my 2 prior Braun razors, where the sideburn trimmer worked great.  I&#x27;m not sure why they tried to fix a problem that didn&#x27;t exist.  (I was going to tolerate it because I have a separate trimmer than I can use, but if I didn&#x27;t, then that design alone would probably keep me from purchasing this product.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months now and I can say conclusively this the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. My skin is as smooth as a newborn&#x27;s. The cleaning system is great. I clean it every other shave sometimes with the brush, sometimes rinsing, and sometimes the \\&quot;system\\&quot; so I&#x27;m still on my first cleaner solution. I haven&#x27;t experienced any battery issues or any other complications and as far as usability of the trimmer goes I have no trouble with sideburn trimming. This is a beautiful, well built machine that I would very highly recommend to every man, some women too.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun previously and loved it. Went to a Norelco then figured I would retry another Braun. I did not think it gave that great of a shave. Having to continually go over and over some spots to get them clean. It is still loud and the on off button being on the side is annoying. Having to sent it back to Braun was a surprise also as Amazon would not take it back before the 30 day trial was up. Think I will stick with the triple header  from now on.</li>
    <li> I have experience using three different mid-range Norelco 3-head shaver models, as well as several Gillette razors.  Here&#x27;s how the Braun 390cc compares against them all.    Pros:  * Water rinsable...doesn&#x27;t require you to use their cleaning solution everytime.  * When you do use the cleaning system, it does clean it thoroughly, as well as lubricates the head unit; which I would hope could help the head unit last longer.  * Seems to cut closer to the skin than the Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used.  * Does not seem to irritate my skin by jamming on a whisker and turning into an oversized electric tweezer, as the Norelco&#x27;s occasionally did.  * Pivoting head seems to be a nice upgrade over lower models.  * Great ergonomics and aesthetics.    Cons:  * I generally have to pass over every plot of my face 4-5 times before it cuts every whisker in that area.  This problem is even worse on my neck.  It really doesn&#x27;t add *that* much time to a shaving, but this was a problem with my old Norelco&#x27;s, and I had hoped the Braun&#x27;s wouldn&#x27;t do it...probably the biggest disappointment to me.  * I&#x27;m convinced that Braun wants me to grow mutton chops, because there is a streak of my sideburns immediately adjacent to my ear that I have to really stretch the skin away from the ear for it to even reach with the cutting head because of \\&quot;dead zones\\&quot; on the sides of the shaver head that are occupied by the two swivel mounts.  * I&#x27;m relatively certain that the noise it makes when I use it is what startles the neighbor&#x27;s dog early in the mornings.    ---Summary---  Razors ALWAYS give you the closest shave...personally, I like the vibrating Gillette&#x27;s.  But, for an everyday shave without the mess of gel, cream, or an EMT crew after you cut yourself, the 390cc is pretty good.  We&#x27;ll see how it works over time, as that&#x27;s how my Norelco&#x27;s lost their lustre.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun to replace a 14 month old Norelco that needed a head replacement. The Braun costs less and shaves better. Also, a replacement head for the Braun, when the time comes, will cost about 1/3 the price of the Norelco head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is great for peachfuzz, but real men don&#x27;t have time for toys like this.  Stick to your Mach3 or whatever real blades you already use.  It&#x27;s really a shame that these things don&#x27;t really work effectively.  Oh, and there&#x27;s really nothing like constantly rubbing the same area of your face over and over again with harsh metal that doesn&#x27;t really cut it.  Stick to razors, men.</li>
    <li> I replaced a Norelco rotary shaver with the Braun.  I liked the idea of a shaver being cleaned, sanitized and charged after each shave so I bought the Braun.  So far, it shaves much closer than my Norelco.  The shaver is not quite as \\&quot;mobile\\&quot; as the Norelco due to its shape and it is noisier than my Norelco, but it is comfortable on my face and does a good job.  The cleaning system works well but is also noisy for about 5 minutes.  You do have to replace the cleaning fluid cartridge after every so many cleanings, but that doesn&#x27;t entail a lot of money.  All in all, I like the shaver and would buy it again.  I do use a pre-shaving fluid on my face and it seems to help with the closeness of the shave.</li>
    <li> I jused used this razor for the first time and was quite dissapointed.  After many attempts, I still has stubble this razor cannot seem to get.  Luckily I work in a factory so it doesn&#x27;t matter.  I&#x27;ll give it another shot after I get some electric shave or something like that.  For the price and the other comments, very dissapointed.  Stick with the razor.</li>
    <li> To make a long story short, I can&#x27;t even think of shaving daily with blades because of irritation. I also own an 5-year-old high-end Norelco rotary (like it quite a bit), but I can only get a close shave with it while shaving (wet) every 3-4 days, I can shave with it (dry) daily with only minor irritation, but not a close shave... not close at all! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After researching insatiably, I decided to try a foil electric (Panasonic or Braun) because almost every review I read said that it provides less irritation and a closer shave than a rotary, and it&#x27;s better for shorter hairs, making it ideal for daily shaving.  My plan was to buy the Braun, use it for 30 days, return it and then give the Panasonic a try for the next 30 days, and then choose the one I liked most. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Let me put it this way, I know it takes the skin 2-4 weeks to get used to a new shaving system; I have owned the Braun for a total of THREE DAYS (that&#x27;s right, 3 shaves) and I can honestly tell you that I will NOT be returning it, and not even thinking about trying out the Panasonic. This is the best shave I have ever had in my life, period!   &lt;br /&gt;The first shave wasn&#x27;t as close as I was expecting, but after running it through the cleaning system, the next two shaves were spectacular... close, smooth and not one bit of irritation! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oh, and don&#x27;t pay attention to those who complain about the cleaning station being loud... I can&#x27;t even hear the damn thing while the shower is running, and it only makes noise for about 5 minutes, after that it&#x27;s all quiet... plus it has this really cool blue light that gives my sink counter a very high tech look.</li>
    <li> My new Braun razor works very well.  I am totally pleased with t he purchase, especially the fact that it is self cleaning.  Just push the button and it takes care of everything.  Excellent!  Charles, Bluffton, SC</li>
    <li> It is a very good product and I am very satisfied with its performance.   The shipping and handling were also top notch and it arrived ahead of schedule.  Dealing with Amazon has always been a pleasure.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I had an older Braun which served me quite well.  I had a Norelco before that.  Overall Braun to me works the best with less irritation.    To the product....so far I&#x27;m very pleased with the shave.  My wife seems to like the smoothness of the shave as well which says a lot to me.  I have only charged it up once and over a few weeks now its still going strong.  I keep resisting the urge to charge it but I want to see how long this puppy lasts!  So far excellent!      The warning light about \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; is nice.  All I have done so far is pop the foil off and rinse it with water every few days.  I always empty it out daily but it seems to reach a point where the finer particles bring to the warning light eventually.    I haven&#x27;t used the disinfectent cleaner system yet.  I had it on my old Braun and just never really got into the habit nor wanted to spring for replacements.  So far I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use it.    Cost was great on this.  I happened to catch an Amazon price for the 390 model which included the cleaner system that was cheaper than the 370 to my door so I jumped on that.    Overall I gave it 5 stars.  Its the best I&#x27;ve used so far.  Takes my old Braun up a notch.</li>
    <li> After many many years of using shaving gel and blade I finally switched.  All I can say is WOW   Shoulda done this years ago, or maybe not...... maybe it is now that these machines are really working.  I tried one a few years back and my skin was irritated for about two days, really red.  With this Braun I did not get or feel any irritation and the shave was very close.  Now after a about a month of use I am getting an extremely close shave and feel very happy about having switched!  No more cuts.  Great and highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I switched from one of the old model of Norelco to this. and it&#x27;s worth the money. though it takes a bit more time than my older one, i get a really close shave. to add more, i never felt the irritation i used to have with my old rotary shaver. really good...</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products ever developed for men. It saves all the hassle of using shaving cream/foam and buying blades etc and finishes the job in approx 5 minutes. You get a clean look for no effort. I bought it for 85 and then for my friend for 80. Too cool. The cleaning system is extremely good. It cleans and lubricates well, and almost gives the shaver the same new like touch. Since the cleaning fluid is volatile I usually remove the cartridge after cleaning and cover it again with the lid. I am assuming that it will make it last longer. I am using this product for more than a month now. I love 5 min shave every morning, the first thing I do after I wake up. The shave is almost as close as a with regular razor. Since I don&#x27;t have to buy and trash blades every now and then, it is good for environment also (one reason making it worth the price). I would say definitely one of best product ever designed for men. If the blades really last for 18 months I would like to give it 10 stars. Lets see... buy it guys, don&#x27;t think twice. If you have more money go for higher end versions but this is extremely good. This is my first shaver and I am 10000% satisfied. Keep it up BRAUN... cheers.</li>
    <li> I was given a Braun 390cc Clean &amp; Renew System for Christmas. It replaced a Braun 7505 shaver. This is the 4th Braun shaver I have owned in 30 years. I am disappointed in the shave it gives versus the previous shavers. The travel case has no provision for the cord and there is no cover for the head. They seem to have cut corners with this shaver.</li>
    <li> This thing gave me skin irritations.  But since that may be my fault and not the shaver&#x27;s fault, let&#x27;s see.  The self cleaning function isn&#x27;t that good....and you have to get refills of the cleaning chemical which does not come cheap.  I haven&#x27;t used this in a year or more...it&#x27;s just sitting there.</li>
    <li> The Lith/Ion rechargeable battery is long lasting, and keeps the speed up until real close to recharge time...doesn&#x27;t slow down over time like other batteries.  High quality you&#x27;d expect from Braun.  I don&#x27;t use the Clean and Renew system.  Bulky and awkward.  I just brush out the blades from time to time...works just fine.  The clean and renew is more of a gimmick...and can cost you if you opt to keep buying the refills from them.</li>
</ol>
