      <li>I love Kai</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too overpowering, but more like a delicate,yet exotic, flowery smell.</li>
      <li>I discovered Kai some years ago when a sample was sent with my &#x27;Child&#x27; perfume order, which I also love, btw.</li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t order any more.</li>
      <li>I love gardenias.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t pay $30 for it, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
      <li>Price is much better in amazon compared to retail.</li>
      <li>No alcohol smell like most department store perfumes.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments when I wear it--especially from guys.  </li>
      <li>I wear this scent way more than all of my others.  </li>
      <li>Plus, not too many people have it</li>
      <li>I used it sparingly, but was pleased to find that the fragrance lasted well.  </li>
      <li>I get compliments on it and love how the scent reminds me of tropical vacations to Maui, Bora Bora and so on.</li>
      <li>I love the Kai Oil.</li>
      <li>It does not smell that flowery, mostly gardenia.    </li>
      <li>I love this roller ball.</li>
      <li>I have a friend that has now started wearing it also. :)</li>
      <li>Over a bit of time, I felt the spray was a bit more perfumey and the oil a bit softer.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is beautiful floral but with something else added that makes this one of my new favorites.</li>
      <li>However, as the day went on, I became more aware of the fragrance and how beautiful the scent truely was.  </li>
      <li>When I first tried this oil, I liked it and thought that it smelled nice.  </li>
      <li>I first bought the Kai body cream and loved the smell.  </li>
      <li>Pleasant smell and the travel size is very convenient to take on the go.</li>
      <li>The floral scent is soft and feminine -- great for day/evening wear.  </li>
      <li>This is a lovely refreshing , not too powerful or overwhelming, scent.  </li>
      <li>Goes on easy</li>
      <li>love all the white flowers and the roll on is a great travel in my purse item.</li>
      <li>I found a very quick response to my order from this vendor through Amazon.</li>
      <li>This is a great sexy, intoxicating blend of gardenia mingled with white exotics.  </li>
      <li>This perfume is way too strong.  </li>
      <li>like I have a strong perfume</li>
      <li>I wear this on the days i want a pick me up or on my special date :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I love their oil and would order again despite the price, worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I am not a fan of heavy perfume but this is perfect.</li>
      <li>The scent is light, floral and it smells so clean.</li>
      <li>I love the light, flowery scent of Kai, I first smelled it in the gift shop of a hotel</li>
      <li>and I like having an original scent.      </li>
      <li>(Amazon is typically impeccable with their immediate shipping but they cannot control the outside vendors!)  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very feminine and sophisticated.  </li>
      <li>i do love it so much..</li>
      <li>and I have a lot that I wear, sandalwood, egyptian musk, patchouli, but this one takes the cake, it is not thick like the other ones that I have, but the smell is just perfect, not overpowering, nor overly sweet.  </li>
      <li>This oil is so fresh and clean smelling.</li>
      <li>It is such a nice scent and ultra light weight.</li>
      <li>I love it for something different and exotic smelling.  </li>
      <li>Their perfume, which is the most expensive I have ever ordered in my life, leaves a light scent, not as strong as the oil, but would be good to spritz on the scarves worn around the neck or for light smell for the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You just cannot buy perfumes without smelling - although I did with Jo Malone on 2 different scents and LOVE them!</li>
      <li>Also the Body Wash is great too, also too little.</li>
      <li>Only perfume I own.</li>
      <li>Pricey, but worth it.</li>
      <li>Saw it recommended by a fashion guest on a local TV show - her praise was so enthusiastic that I thought,</li>
      <li>As one reviewer said, you&#x27;d have to be sitting right by me to notice it; I have to put my wrists on my nose to smell it.</li>
      <li>She was right.    </li>
      <li>and I was pleasantly surprised that my items arrived so quickly!  </li>
      <li>I also love the more subtle Kai Body Glow because of the quick, right out of the shower moisturizing benefits</li>
      <li>It turns out that tiny bottle lasts for quite a while, even when I use it every day, and I have gotten many compliments on the glorious scent.</li>
      <li>Also, the roll-on is a perfect size especially for small purses.</li>
      <li>I have been using the Kai Body Glow for several months now and love it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this fragrance and the size is perfect to put in your purse or for travel. The price was also good as I have bought this same item before in my hometown and it was more expensive.</li>
    <li> I often get compliments when I wear the Kai fragrance.  I like this purse size bottle, and the rollerball applicator helps when I am driving.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume oil after trying Kai&#x27;s body lotion.  The smell is so delicious!  It&#x27;s so different from any other perfume that I have.  I love it for something different and exotic smelling.  I get so many compliments when I wear it--especially from guys.  They seem to really like this scent.  It&#x27;s very feminine and sophisticated.  When I got my bottle in the mail, I was a little disapointed that it was so small, but quickly discovered that you only need a little bit.  I just apply a small ammount and the scent stays all day so the bottle lasts for a lot longer than I thought it would.  I wear this scent way more than all of my others.  Plus, not too many people have it and I like having an original scent.      Carolyn   My favorite other products:  ...to look younger, Relastin Revitalizer  ...to feel younger, MBT Flame Sport Walkers   ...to live longer, Weil Daily Anti-Oxidant Tablets</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Kai perfume oil with another purchase I made at Amazon.  I normally throw away perfume samples because I am allergic to most scents, but after smelling this oil (which claims to be \\&quot;different on everyone\\&quot;), I had to try it.  It didn&#x27;t bother my allergies or irritate my skin.  I was initially put off my the cost, but the fragrance was intoxicating to me, and I had to get it.  It turns out that tiny bottle lasts for quite a while, even when I use it every day, and I have gotten many compliments on the glorious scent.</li>
    <li> This is the best scent i have ever smelled!!!!  I wear this on the days i want a pick me up or on my special date :)</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh, I can not gush enough about this oil, I thought seriously, no way would I wear gardenia on me, I figured on me, it would be overpowering.  This is one of my favorite oils and I have a lot that I wear, sandalwood, egyptian musk, patchouli, but this one takes the cake, it is not thick like the other ones that I have, but the smell is just perfect, not overpowering, nor overly sweet.  It does last all day which is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered their other products.  Their bath wash is a nice smell of gardenia and is not drying or itchy afterwards.  Their lotion absorbs well into the skin and leaves a good scent of gardenias throughout the day.  I ordered the oil spritzer, I am not sure what it is suppose to do, it is not oily at all, it absorbs completely and the effect is light.  Their perfume, which is the most expensive I have ever ordered in my life, leaves a light scent, not as strong as the oil, but would be good to spritz on the scarves worn around the neck or for light smell for the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love their oil and would order again despite the price, worth every penny.</li>
    <li> When I first tried this oil, I liked it and thought that it smelled nice.  However, as the day went on, I became more aware of the fragrance and how beautiful the scent truely was.  It&#x27;s not too overpowering, but more like a delicate,yet exotic, flowery smell. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I discovered Kai some years ago when a sample was sent with my &#x27;Child&#x27; perfume order, which I also love, btw. The scents are quite similar to me, however, Kai ultimately won out. While the 1/8 oz bottle is small, it typically lasts me a year (using it, on average  3 or 4 times per week.) I also love the more subtle Kai Body Glow because of the quick, right out of the shower moisturizing benefits and I can lavish my entire body in it without over-powering. It&#x27;s not your typical Grandma&#x27;s jar of cream gardenia scent, rather, much like the Hawaiian Pikake Lei. Intoxicating. I feel pretty and &#x27;summery&#x27; when I wear Kai, and I particularly appreciate this during cold, colorless winter months. There is nothing like a scent to transport you to another place. Kai takes me to an island paradise.</li>
    <li> This smells so wonderful! Wear it and you will get compliments. It seems like it might be a summertime-only scent (i.e. very tropical), but I&#x27;d wear it year round. I only wish they made a larger size in the oil...</li>
    <li> I first bought the Kai body cream and loved the smell.  I ended up buying this to compliment the cream and the smell lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and a favorite in my household.  I have two daughters that are constantly using it too, however I have declared this as \\&quot;mine\\&quot;!  I found a very quick response to my order from this vendor through Amazon. (Amazon is typically impeccable with their immediate shipping but they cannot control the outside vendors!)  I have ordered a few times from this vendor and both times I received my product within a week without paying extra charges for it.  I highly recommend this product, and I highly recommend this vendor for their pricing as well as follow-through on getting the order out.  Love that!!! It makes a difference for me!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t be put off by the price of this small bottle. it&#x27;s loaded.  all it takes is one swish of the roller ball on the wrist or neck and you&#x27;ll smell like swanky fields of soft gardenia for blooming hours to come. mmmmmmm, a fave!</li>
    <li> Does that sum it up for you? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How about the fact that it&#x27;s small enough to tote anywhere.  Or the fact that EVERYONE asks what that beautiful smell is. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soft and delicious and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I thought the oil would help this perfume last, but alas, it didn&#x27;t for me.  I love gardenias.  I even bought the lotion to layer the fragrance, but that didn&#x27;t help either.</li>
    <li> Really happy with this purchase at such a great price for one of my very favorite fragrances. Someone had written that it wasn&#x27;t really Kai, not so. I originally purchased Kai in San Diego in 1999 at some exclusive shop and have purchased it at least six times since and my nose knows Kai.</li>
    <li> Perfect good price, absolutely same as nortstrom</li>
    <li> This is a great sexy, intoxicating blend of gardenia mingled with white exotics.  It&#x27;s lush and heady.  Whenever I wear this people always ask what I&#x27;m wearing.  The only downside is it&#x27;s expensive for such a tiny bottle, 1/8oz (way small), but a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve tried a few dupes for much less.  Haute Tub makes one that&#x27;s almost spot on for about half the price.</li>
    <li> I love the Kai Oil. As one previous reviewer said it is not alot for the price. I agree the Kai Oil needs to be in a bigger container. Also the Body Wash is great too, also too little.</li>
    <li> This perfume is way too strong.  I ordered it online because all of the reviews say its a faint smell.  THey are wrong.  I barely put a dab on both wrists and my neck and the smell is so overpowering that its given me a headache.    It does not smell that flowery, mostly gardenia.    Its definitely not what I expected.  I will probably send this to my grandmother because it smells like a perfume for someone closer to her age.</li>
    <li> My friend has some and I enjoyed it so I bought some.  The fragrance stays the same instead of changing to something I don&#x27;t like after it has been on for a while.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Kai Body Glow for several months now and love it. I thought I would try the Kai Perfume Oil and really like it too!  The scent is light, floral and it smells so clean. I am not a fan of heavy perfume but this is perfect. I highly recommend it - it takes me back to Hawaii every time I wear it!</li>
    <li> On a [[ASIN:B0006Q233A Kai lotion]] page, reviewer \\&quot;L. Robinson, &#x27;perfumaniac&#x27;\\&quot; described the scent as, \\&quot;that fabulous smell that hits you when you walk into a high-end florist, the one that makes you feel as if you are instantly on vacation.\\&quot; That sold me. I searched out the perfume.    She was right.    I tried the oil on one wrist and the [[ASIN:B000HIC78I spray]] on the other. They are so close to being identical that it was hard to choose. In the end, I picked the oil. Over a bit of time, I felt the spray was a bit more perfumey and the oil a bit softer. But you can&#x27;t go wrong with either.    I usually don&#x27;t like floral scents, but this one won me over. It smells like Hawaii, as others have noted. I only wish it were a bit stronger. As one reviewer said, you&#x27;d have to be sitting right by me to notice it; I have to put my wrists on my nose to smell it. It doesn&#x27;t waft. Maybe when I wear it on my neck, as well, it&#x27;ll be more smelly.    I also tried the lotion, FYI. That is a very light scent. I wouldn&#x27;t pay $30 for it, that&#x27;s for sure. This oil, however, was worth it to me, even though it does come in a ridiculously tiny bottle.    I can&#x27;t wait to wear it again and again. I love scents that make me feel something, and this one makes me feel good.</li>
    <li> I hate to be the party pooper here, but I really really don&#x27;t like this perfume at all. I&#x27;m ready to give away the very small $40 bottle that I have. Saw it recommended by a fashion guest on a local TV show - her praise was so enthusiastic that I thought, o.k I&#x27;ll take a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad consumer, bad consumer me... You just cannot buy perfumes without smelling - although I did with Jo Malone on 2 different scents and LOVE them!</li>
    <li> this scent takes me back  to hawaii!  love all the white flowers and the roll on is a great travel in my purse item. really enjoy the essential oils for fragrance instead of synthetic stuff.</li>
    <li> This is the best tropical oil there is. It smells just like the plumeria flowers all around Hawaii.YOU HAVE TO GET THIS!!!</li>
    <li> I love this roller ball. It is such a nice scent and ultra light weight. I get compliments every time I wear it. I have a friend that has now started wearing it also. :)</li>
    <li> I tried this on in a store, not knowing anything about it and LOVED it!  I could not stop smelling my arm for hours.  I was so sad when it dissapated.  So I bought it on Amazon for about $10 less than I saw in the store.  I can&#x27;t wait to get in the mail.  It is the most wonderful perfume I have ever smelled!</li>
    <li> It will last a while even in this small roll on.  The smell kinda reminds me of bathroom spray floral. I certainly didn&#x27;t get a ton of compliments on it. I have it in my car for emergency perfume...in case I forget before I leave.</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell and the travel size is very convenient to take on the go.</li>
    <li> This oil is so fresh and clean smelling. Was not sure of purchasing because of some reviews that said it fades quickly,not true at least for me.I put two tiny drops on my wrists on Saturday and I can still faintly smell on Sunday. The.The fragrance is beautiful floral but with something else added that makes this one of my new favorites. Delivery was quick price was less than purchasing anywhere else.Another plus my husband likes it.</li>
    <li> My sister gave me one of these tiny roll-on applicators as a gift and I fell completely in love with the scent!  I used it sparingly, but was pleased to find that the fragrance lasted well.  It is an expensive purchase for me, but a nice spoil for myself when I want to feel feminine and sexy.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous scent! Bottle goes on very well....you can manage the flow!</li>
    <li> I love the light, flowery scent of Kai, I first smelled it in the gift shop of a hotel but they wanted nearly double the price of what I found on Amazon. The 1.8 ounce roll on is perfect for my purse.</li>
    <li> Nice scent but expensive for size.  Have not tried perfume but am planning on purchasing. All in all very nice</li>
    <li> Now can use along with lotion. Great fragrance! Again it is a great product for in purse or for travel</li>
    <li> Not as long lasting as I had hoped.  Clean floral scent...smells nice, but for me, isn&#x27;t long lasting.</li>
    <li> I purchased Kai Perfume Oil and the Body Lotion through b-glowing.com and I was pleasantly surprised that my items arrived so quickly!  The floral scent is soft and feminine -- great for day/evening wear.  Also, the roll-on is a perfect size especially for small purses.</li>
    <li> Way too flowery for me! I keep trying, though. Maybe a drop hidden somewhere deep under my clothing would be ok. Afraid if the bees get a whiff!</li>
    <li> did not care for the scent,t was very strong i thought it would be lighter scent.Husband did not like it</li>
    <li> For the price, not worth it to me.  Very small and the fragrance is hardly there.  Won&#x27;t order any more.</li>
    <li> Love the perfume oil! I especially love the roller ball versus a spray. Goes on easy and it&#x27;s just enough where I don&#x27;t feel like I have a strong perfume smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kai products smell so good!</li>
    <li> Only perfume I own. The fragrance lasts all day and this bottle will last almost a year. I love Kai</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it.  Plus it is hypoallergenic.  Scent is wonderful and easy to apply with the roller ball top.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Love it. Pricey, but worth it. Very feminine and primitive. Love it...</li>
    <li> I like the smell of Gardenia which is basically what this oil is. I feel like I could have gotten a lot more for $50 because the size of the bottle is tiny! But I use it daily and it lasts all day without being overpowering, it&#x27;s a very subtle scent that one can only smell if they are right beside you.</li>
    <li> This scent is simply gorgeous. I bought the body wash, body lotion, eau de parfum and the perfume oil. I get compliments on it and love how the scent reminds me of tropical vacations to Maui, Bora Bora and so on. These items are quite pricey, so this was splurge. Agree with other reviewers that for the body wash, lotion and oil the sizes should be larger. Cannot seem to justify spending $60 on the body butter just yet. The only turnoff on this product was the &#x27;Oprah loves it&#x27; part that someone wrote; that makes me cringe since I am not an Oprah Cult follower --too full of herself and always wanting the spotlight.      This is a truly beautiful fragrance if you like floral scents. I will definitely purchase this again.    Update 1/24/15:  The scented candle  is also wonderful!</li>
    <li> The perfume bottle/ roller is very small.but i really liked the scent. I use it with the body creme. The scent it so lux. Price is much better in amazon compared to retail.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely refreshing , not too powerful or overwhelming, scent.  It wears well and doesn&#x27;t fade or change over time. A little is all it takes so although the bottle is so tiny, it should last a while. No alcohol smell like most department store perfumes. Nice</li>
    <li> This is just the best aroma ... I think I&#x27;m back in Hawaii.  It does seem to last longer than others I have tried.</li>
    <li> FAVE FAVE FAVE// i do love it so much.. i would buy the factory if they would sell it to me!</li>
    <li> love this fragrance - makes me feel like I am on vacation!</li>
    <li> I love it and smells great on and the Oil stays on all day!</li>
