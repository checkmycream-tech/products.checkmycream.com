      <li>IF I WANT MORE</li>

      <li>I get a bundle and save alittle money:)</li>
      <li>THESE ARE REALLY CUTE LASHES.</li>

      <li>Looks the most natural :) I always get so many compliments every time I wear them!</li>
      <li>I am a makeup artist and these are some of my favorite lashes to use when a client doesn&#x27;t want a full strip lash.</li>
      <li>if you want to wear eye lashes during the day that&#x27;s the perfect one, its super pretty and natural .</li>
      <li>These are one of my favorites, perfect for a little pop but not too overdone.  </li>
      <li>THE FIT</li>
      <li>I was so excited when I came across them on here.</li>
      <li>I use these for special occasions and date night.</li>
      <li>Overall though a good product for the price</li>
      <li>Quickly roll each strip into a tube</li>
      <li>Also easy to clean with baby shampoo or gentle cleanser.</li>
      <li>The lashes aren&#x27;t very consistent and I&#x27;ve tried 2 times to get them to work</li>
      <li>They are easy to put on and look natural and full, but not too full.</li>
      <li>but i look forward to getting them right</li>
      <li>Because they&#x27;re so flimsy on the inside I need a good glue to keep the little tips from popping up.</li>
      <li>Not use to wearing false lashes so the accents are beautiful and they r reusable they just add something subtle but beautiful</li>
      <li>These are great for a subtle boost.</li>
      <li>I wore them on Halloween and they really enhanced my eyes.</li>
      <li>very dissapointing</li>
      <li>They are so straight across</li>
      <li>Very subtle, not noticeable at all actually lol</li>
      <li>This is a good half set and a reasonable length, so it doesn&#x27;t look obvious that I&#x27;m wearing falsies.</li>
      <li>Perfect for occasions when I want my lashes to look long, but I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone to notice they were false.</li>
      <li>If you are steady handed</li>
      <li>so soft, easily blend with natural lashes and give your eyes that extra &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>These look natural and photograph really well.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE THESE FOR EVERYDAY.</li>
      <li>Looks very nice in photos and they don&#x27;t look fake.</li>
      <li>I use a full strip when I want something more dramatic.</li>
      <li>They give a little extra length to the ends and are super comfortable.</li>
      <li>These blend well and good for a day look, not too dramatic.</li>
      <li>JUST A TOUCH  VERY NATURAL LOOKING.</li>
      <li>I can wear them more than once, and they aren&#x27;t as in your face and fake looking as full lashes.</li>
      <li>I have been wearing full lashes cut in half to make my own corner lashes for a subtle impact effect.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t wait for the glue to dry a bit, they won&#x27;t stick right away, and you&#x27;ll end up smearing glue all over your eyelid.</li>
      <li>But natural.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t look natural like some others I have bought.</li>
      <li>These are my fav cause there small and easy to use.</li>
      <li>but after about 6 or 7 tries I got the right one on just fine and the left one was on a little lopsided</li>
      <li>With a little mascara they blend right into my natural lashes.</li>
      <li>The only reason I gave it less than 5 stars is because the packaging was super mangled when it got to my house.</li>
      <li>IT IS CHEAPER TO BUY THEM HERE THAN IN THE STORE :O)</li>
      <li>These are my favorite false eyelashes.</li>
      <li>Look natural - I bought these since I was out of my usual, which have a little more weight to them.</li>

<li> Look natural - I bought these since I was out of my usual, which have a little more weight to them.</li>
<li> These are just terrific - somehow, they are simultaneously lush, but totally natural and undetectable as fake lashes.  </li>
<li> I bought some demi lashes previously and thought this one would be similar.  </li>
<li> Immediately unroll them, dab glue on the base (use the glue very sparingly, but make sure that you have glue going to the very ends of the silicone base), wait for 30 seconds, then stick them on.  </li>
<li> (this makes the silicone base more flexible and contoured).  </li>
<li> THEY ARE A LITTLE BIT THICKER.     </li>
<li> I have tried some of the other accents and was disappointed, these were the last ones left to try.</li>
<li> If you don&#x27;t roll up the strips, the silicone base remains a bit straight and stiff, and it&#x27;s more difficult to get the base to adhere along your lash line.  </li>
<li> Seriously!  </li>
<li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like the fake lashes look, and can&#x27;t tell when I&#x27;m wearing these, but always compliments my eyes when I put these on.</li>
<li> I was disappointed and did not wear them.</li>
<li> Was very disappointed.  </li>

    <li> I LOVE THESE FOR EVERYDAY. JUST A TOUCH  VERY NATURAL LOOKING. IF I WANT MORE I BUY BABIES THE FIT MY EYE PERFECTLY.</li>
    <li> Only came one pair of lashes when it was suposed to be 3. very dissapointing</li>
    <li> These are one of my favorites, perfect for a little pop but not too overdone.  These look natural and photograph really well.  Easy to put on AND take off.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE REALLY CUTE LASHES. HOWEVER, I PREFER THE STYLE 305 BC THEY ARE A LITTLE BIT THICKER.     IT IS CHEAPER TO BUY THEM HERE THAN IN THE STORE :O)</li>
    <li> To my eyes are they are shorts.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist and these are some of my favorite lashes to use when a client doesn&#x27;t want a full strip lash. They give a little extra length to the ends and are super comfortable. No one will know you have them on. But will notice your eyes look bigger and bolder. But natural.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing full lashes cut in half to make my own corner lashes for a subtle impact effect. I was elated to find these &amp;#34;accent&amp;#34; lashes to make the process easier. I am definitely purchasing these again</li>
    <li> Not use to wearing false lashes so the accents are beautiful and they r reusable they just add something subtle but beautiful w my eye makeup</li>
    <li> Very subtle, not noticeable at all actually lol</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with purchase. I wore them on Halloween and they really enhanced my eyes.</li>
    <li> if you want to wear eye lashes during the day that&#x27;s the perfect one, its super pretty and natural .</li>
    <li> These are the only lashes I ever wear. Looks the most natural :) I always get so many compliments every time I wear them!</li>
    <li> Advertised as pack of 4. Received 1 pair. Would have saved a lot by buying local. Was very disappointed.  Won&#x27;t make this mistake again.</li>
    <li> These were awesome. I have tried some of the other accents and was disappointed, these were the last ones left to try. I loved them. They give lashes that extra pop. Looks very nice in photos and they don&#x27;t look fake. With a little mascara they blend right into my natural lashes. I use these for special occasions and date night. My husband doesn&#x27;t like the fake lashes look, and can&#x27;t tell when I&#x27;m wearing these, but always compliments my eyes when I put these on. Win-win.</li>
    <li> Look natural - I bought these since I was out of my usual, which have a little more weight to them. These blend well and good for a day look, not too dramatic. Because they&#x27;re so flimsy on the inside I need a good glue to keep the little tips from popping up. Overall though a good product for the price</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and looks great.</li>
    <li> These are just terrific - somehow, they are simultaneously lush, but totally natural and undetectable as fake lashes.  I wear them everyday, and I work in a very staid corporate environment.  Here&#x27;s how I put them on (this takes me all of a minute).  Quickly roll each strip into a tube (this makes the silicone base more flexible and contoured).  Immediately unroll them, dab glue on the base (use the glue very sparingly, but make sure that you have glue going to the very ends of the silicone base), wait for 30 seconds, then stick them on.  If you don&#x27;t roll up the strips, the silicone base remains a bit straight and stiff, and it&#x27;s more difficult to get the base to adhere along your lash line.  If you don&#x27;t wait for the glue to dry a bit, they won&#x27;t stick right away, and you&#x27;ll end up smearing glue all over your eyelid. I like the colorless glue because it is invisible when it dries.  If you want to kick it up a notch, use the #305 lashes.  They are probably a bit too much for a conservative office, but look great for a night out.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes but I can&#x27;t find them at any of my local drugstores! I was so excited when I came across them on here. It&#x27;s a pretty good deal for a 4 pack. I can wear them more than once, and they aren&#x27;t as in your face and fake looking as full lashes. The only reason I gave it less than 5 stars is because the packaging was super mangled when it got to my house.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t look natural like some others I have bought. I was disappointed and did not wear them.</li>
    <li> Economical; nice quality</li>
    <li> Love these eyelas ends!</li>
    <li> These are great for a subtle boost. Perfect for occasions when I want my lashes to look long, but I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone to notice they were false. I use a full strip when I want something more dramatic. These lashes keep their shape well and can be reused several times.</li>
    <li> I bought some demi lashes previously and thought this one would be similar.  No.  I can&#x27;t wear them.  Doesn&#x27;t seem hair like at all.  They are so straight across I couldn&#x27;t keep them glued on.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes!  I would definitely recommend them.  They are easy to put on and look natural and full, but not too full.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite false eyelashes. I&#x27;m Asian with teeny tiny eyelashes. This is a good half set and a reasonable length, so it doesn&#x27;t look obvious that I&#x27;m wearing falsies.</li>
    <li> I order my lashes on Amazon cause I get a bundle and save alittle money:) These are my fav cause there small and easy to use.</li>
    <li> The lashes aren&#x27;t very consistent and I&#x27;ve tried 2 times to get them to work but i look forward to getting them right</li>
    <li> I either need more practice in applying these, or I need my own make-up artist!  Seriously!  I feel like such a klutz but after about 6 or 7 tries I got the right one on just fine and the left one was on a little lopsided and I hoped no one would notice. I liked the look of right eye so I&#x27;ll keep trying.  If you are steady handed you probably would like these a lot and I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> so soft, easily blend with natural lashes and give your eyes that extra &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;. Also easy to clean with baby shampoo or gentle cleanser.</li>
