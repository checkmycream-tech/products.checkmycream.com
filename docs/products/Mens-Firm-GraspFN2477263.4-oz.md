      <li>This is very nice hair clay</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant smell too.</li>
      <li>and you are good to go for the rest of the day</li>
      <li>Good, but not what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I have thinner hair so this is nice</li>
      <li>i really love all the redken products but this one is really good</li>
      <li>It has a very light hold.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s been my favorite styling that I have tried (and I&#x27;ve tried just about everything you can think of).</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite hair products.</li>
      <li>This has more of a butter consistency if I had to describe it but not oily.</li>
      <li>Also when I think of clay I think of a drier more dificult to apply product.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite styling products.</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant and crisp without being overpowering.</li>
      <li>I find it works best when my hair is totally dry.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was definitely easy to wash out</li>
      <li>And the smell was good too; however, there are plenty of products out there that smell just as good (if not better) and have better hold and a matte finish.  </li>
      <li>: This goes on easily and is easy to get the right amount.</li>
      <li>: There really arent many</li>
      <li>This is full of the stuff you are paying for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>with a &amp;#34;matte finish&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s supposed to be easy to wash out of your hair - those are exactly the features that I was looking for in a hair product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the right amount of hold and manageability, unlike hair spray, gel and mousse.</li>
      <li>Washes right out.</li>
      <li>I should have known right away that this would be the case because the product felt a bit oily in hands.  </li>
      <li>A litte of this stuff goes a long way but the size is nice if you keep it in a shave kit.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This one is good, but shines a little bit.</li>
      <li>more of a lotion than a &amp;#34;clay&amp;#34;, but it seems to work ok in my short, straight male hair do</li>
      <li>Strangely, the &amp;#34;maneuver-working-wax&amp;#34; holds better and does not shine.</li>
      <li>: As I said above, I think it is an issue with just this type of product but at the end of the day your hair will have a waxy feel that is easy to wash out.</li>
      <li>I had very high expecations for this product.  </li>
      <li>My husband and son like this better than any other styling wax I&#x27;ve bought them.</li>
      <li>This is a Quick video comparing 2 similar Redkin Men products.</li>
      <li>Sure enough, it definitely added a sheen to my hair that I did not want.  </li>
      <li>I started to wear my hair parted and a little bit longer on top</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more of a natural to slightly shiny finish.</li>
      <li>Definitely not a firm grasp.</li>
      <li>I guess I would say it is a citrusy masculine smell.</li>
      <li>but I took it to mean a strong hold.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended, especially for short and medium-length hair.</li>
      <li>it gives hair a roughed up look and feel great for casual messy looks</li>

<li> A little goes a long way which is also nice.&lt;br /&gt;+Look: I like the matte finish.</li>

<li> It has a pliable hold that I would not describe as firm.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Still searching for a less expensive alternative to Aveda grooming clay. I would consider this a creme, not a clay. Good, but not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> As expected - will do business again</li>
    <li> Definitely not a firm grasp. I would recommend this to people with short hair. It has a very light hold.</li>
    <li> Just made my hair feel greesy and fall flat. With a name like firm grasp I was expecting it to provide some hold</li>
    <li> works good and is a very good matte finish</li>
    <li> This one is good, but shines a little bit. Strangely, the &amp;#34;maneuver-working-wax&amp;#34; holds better and does not shine. If you do not want the glow in your hair, go with &amp;#34;maneuver-working-wax&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I know what the pros say about not buying product in a salon and this seems to be the case.  I can&#x27;t find this anywhere except online but this isn&#x27;t the same consistency as what I&#x27;ve bought from my hair stylist.</li>
    <li> This product had very little hold or the texture of a clay. Aside from the smell this product was pretty useless.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite styling products. Just enough hold, but still flexible. Not sticky or stiff and it smells great. My husband and son like this better than any other styling wax I&#x27;ve bought them.</li>
    <li> Wish I&#x27;d tried this stuff years ago. It&#x27;s the right amount of hold and manageability, unlike hair spray, gel and mousse. No odor. Washes right out. Highly recommended, especially for short and medium-length hair.</li>
    <li> This is a Quick video comparing 2 similar Redkin Men products. This is one of my favorite hair products. I say it is misleading because I dont think it is a firm grip or a clay texture at all. It has a pliable hold that I would not describe as firm. Also when I think of clay I think of a drier more dificult to apply product. This has more of a butter consistency if I had to describe it but not oily. Heres the pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Application: This goes on easily and is easy to get the right amount. A little goes a long way which is also nice.&lt;br /&gt;+Look: I like the matte finish. It provides style and flexible hold without giving you that wet look. I have thinner hair so this is nice, it doesn&#x27;t make thin hair look thinner.&lt;br /&gt;+Feel: This does not have the crispy, brittle gel feel which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;+Smell: The smell is pleasant and crisp without being overpowering. I guess I would say it is a citrusy masculine smell. You don&#x27;t notice it at all once applied.&lt;br /&gt;+Size: The container is a bit bigger than a hockey puck. A litte of this stuff goes a long way but the size is nice if you keep it in a shave kit.&lt;br /&gt;+Packaging: I say this because I hate the things that have a smaller plastic container holding the product inside of the larger outer plastic container. I just feel cheated. This is full of the stuff you are paying for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: There really arent many but I&#x27;ll list those I can think of.&lt;br /&gt;-Price: Like I said a little goes a long way but when buying this stuff there is a little sticker shock. I can say that it has lasted me a while.&lt;br /&gt;-Feel: As I said above, I think it is an issue with just this type of product but at the end of the day your hair will have a waxy feel that is easy to wash out.</li>
    <li> Always the best products!</li>
    <li> more of a lotion than a &amp;#34;clay&amp;#34;, but it seems to work ok in my short, straight male hair do</li>
    <li> I had very high expecations for this product.  It advertises &amp;#34;maximum hold&amp;#34; with a &amp;#34;matte finish&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s supposed to be easy to wash out of your hair - those are exactly the features that I was looking for in a hair product.  Unfortunately, I found that it fell short for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the hold is not strong at all (and certainly not &amp;#34;maximum&amp;#34;).  I guess maximum can be interpreted in different ways (maybe it&#x27;s just the maximum hold out of all products in the Redken for Men line?), but I took it to mean a strong hold.  This stuff did not hold my hair well at all and it went flat shortly after I put the product in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I did not find the finish to be &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34;.  I should have known right away that this would be the case because the product felt a bit oily in hands.  Sure enough, it definitely added a sheen to my hair that I did not want.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s quite on the level of old-school hair gel that makes your hair look like it&#x27;s wet, but it&#x27;s certainly not matte either.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more of a natural to slightly shiny finish. If you want matte, look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was definitely easy to wash out so that&#x27;s a plus.  And the smell was good too; however, there are plenty of products out there that smell just as good (if not better) and have better hold and a matte finish.  One such product is the Blind Barber 90 Proof Pomade (http://www.amazon.com/Blind-Barber-Proof-Strong-Pomade/dp/B007XL4ZPA/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1360794527&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;blind+barber).  That&#x27;s been my go-to product lately (just bought it recently) and it&#x27;s been my favorite styling that I have tried (and I&#x27;ve tried just about everything you can think of).</li>
    <li> i really love all the redken products but this one is really good it gives hair a roughed up look and feel great for casual messy looks</li>
    <li> This product is great! It holds my hair all day even though it doesn&#x27;t get hard or sticky. It has a pleasant smell too.</li>
    <li> Holds hair in place, but still allows my hair to move. I hate gluing my hair in place. I find it works best when my hair is totally dry.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great at helping you style your hair. I just dab some on my palm and work it into the roots of my hair and it stands up very nicely without hair spray. This is very nice hair clay and it&#x27;s much cheaper than those expensive salon versions. I&#x27;m a woman and I use this product even though it says it&#x27;s men&#x27;s hair clay.</li>
    <li> Works well, will order again in future</li>
    <li> I order this every other month and I am never dissatisfied with the product not being a greasy hair stylist or the delivery time.</li>
    <li> I started to wear my hair parted and a little bit longer on top so I wanted something that would keep it in place but not have the crunchy texture gels can give you. this product definitely provides that...just towel dry your hair after a shower and put it in and you are good to go for the rest of the day</li>
