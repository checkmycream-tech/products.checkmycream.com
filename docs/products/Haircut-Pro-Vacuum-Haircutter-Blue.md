<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> ok i guess...stopped working a bit...rested it and started working again.</li>
    <li> Not very sharp blades</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive to use this for the first time but let me tell you this hair cutter is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;I cut hubby&#x27;s hair and it turned it out really nice.&lt;br /&gt;Then I had hubby cut my hair and into a layered style and it looks as good as when I get my hair done in a hair salon.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick and a lot of hair and hubby cut 1 1/2  inches off.&lt;br /&gt;Been thinking of getting it for a few years now.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this hair cutter, just wish I would have bought it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;I just saved $45.00 today .&lt;br /&gt;You tube has a few videos on how to use the cutter, very useful.</li>
    <li> My husband was going to cut his hair yesterday. After oiling the blades and cleaning the machine thoroughly, he turned it on. The torque on the vacuum at startup was strong, and the Haircut Pro fell off the counter, but landed on a blanket on the floor.  He thought that surely this did not damage the machine, but upon plugging it in, the machine failed to start back up.  He called the help line, and was transferred to a gentleman who said that he might have to send the machine in for repair, but if he was willing, there were a few things they could try that might just remedy the matter.  My husband was guided through some simple steps and, as the technician suspected, the plug inside the hose had come loose.  He was instructed how to reconnect it and, sure enough, that did the trick.  He was so extremely relieved and thanked the technician over and over.  How many companies would have done this rather than just simply saying &amp;#34;send it in for repair&amp;#34;?  Thanks Haircut Pro for helping fix the machine over the phone!  And at no cost.  We will stick with this company for the duration!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Robocut for over 20 years. Sure, I&#x27;ve saved tons of money on haircuts for me and my 3 kids but the thing I like about it most is the convenience. I no longer have to worry about making an appointment at the salon and then potentially re-scheduling because something came up. Back in the day, I used to have very thick and curly hair. The machine works great on it. Actually, I have found that I&#x27;m able to give myself a better haircut than most professionals. For some reason, a lot of people struggled with cutting my style of hair and keeping it even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford upgrading to the integrated vacuum model I highly recommend it. They are more convenient plus the latest version is more powerful. I have noticed that some negative reviews focus on the machine being too powerful and unsafe. I don&#x27;t really understand that because there is an adjustment to compensate for the amount of suction if that&#x27;s a problem. For me, the increased power is an improvement. The downside of having more power is the machine is a little noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect the machine to last a lifetime. I believe I am on my fifth one. Obviously I think they are worth it otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t keep buying them. I have also convinced several of my friends to purchase them as well. Make sure you oil the blade before using EVERY time. Sometimes I even have to oil the blade after several minutes of use. You&#x27;ll know when you need to oil it by the sound the machine makes. It starts to sound like it&#x27;s working too hard if it&#x27;s on for a while. Lastly, if it feels like it&#x27;s pulling your hair it&#x27;s time to replace the blade.</li>
    <li> Very nice cut, with no cleanup, Thank You.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a RoboCut user for eight or 10 years and am a repeat customer. I can tell you: if all you do is analyze the cost savings (which are very favorable) you&#x27;ll miss an important point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big win with the RoboCut is the convenience. I shudder when I think what I used go through to get a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; haircut. Once I got the RoboCut there was no more calling for an appointment, no waiting on hold, no juggling my time to fit someone else&#x27;s schedule, no fighting through traffic, no sitting in the shop waiting for my turn, no explaining why I want my cut done a certain way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just keep the machine in the closet next to the vacuum cleaner. When I need a cut it&#x27;s out and I&#x27;m done in minutes.  I do it on my schedule: evenings, weekends, holidays, whenever. I can easily squeeze a cut in before an important meeting, or between the morning shower and brunch on Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also easy to make style changes: Are we having a heatwave? Just RoboCut a short style. Want to grow out a little longer? RoboCut a couple times a week to keep things touched up and looking in control.  And here&#x27;s the thing: the haircuts look great!  It doesn&#x27;t even take a lot of practice, you&#x27;ll get the technique in the fist 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I do get an occasional compliment on my hair -- because none of this matters if the haircut looks bad.</li>
    <li> This product was as advertised. They are of good, lasting quality and I would not hesitate to order these again when needed.  Time will tell if it holds up.</li>
    <li> It is a great product. It takes a little bit of getting used to, but it cuts perfect hair every time.</li>
    <li> Had a Robocut for 18 years and used it to cut my husband&#x27;s hair as well as mine.  It gave great haircuts and hopefully this will serve the same purpose.  Works well just a little noisy with the vacuum unit below.</li>
    <li> Very loud not what I thought I was getting</li>
    <li> Dogs hate this thing.  It&#x27;s hard to keep the length adjuster at the same setting.  Have to go over and over and over the head to get all hairs cut to the same length.  Save your money and just buy some Oster clippers.</li>
    <li> My sister bought one of these and suggested it to me.  I love mine.  I&#x27;ve had several compliments on my latest haircut.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a RoboCut for ~6 years now and have really enjoyed using it.  I haven&#x27;t paid for a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; haircut in years.  I now have a 2 year old son and use it on him once a month.  He just sits there watching his favorite show in the comfort of our own home and let&#x27;s me cut his hair.  I was talking to my neighbor about the RoboCut and he told me how hard it was to get his 3 year old to go to the barber.  He told me that as soon as they pulled up to the barber their boy would go nuts and not allow them to even enter the store.  I invited them over one afternoon and his boy let me cut his hair without a problem.  His first hair cut in months.  I gave him my old RoboCut and he&#x27;s thanked me everytime we see each other at the park.  It really does work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional barber ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That about sums up what the Haircut.com PRO Model is all about. It definitely is not a device that a pro barber would use (I showed it to a pro barber friend of mine and she laughed).  But for the other 99% of people who are not pro barbers, this thing could certainly have its place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone trying to cut their own hair ... I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it unless you are striving for a buzz cut look. It&#x27;s just too unwieldly to attempt any kind of intricate styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone trying to cut an adult&#x27;s hair ... basically the same story.  You would have to get very good at using this haircutter, and by that time you would probably be good enough to use electric cutters and a good pair of scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone trying to cut children&#x27;s hair ... bingo! Easy, fun and convenient.  And the built-in vacuum is icing on the cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also appears that the Haircut Pro would work well for someone trying to stylize their pet&#x27;s fur. I haven&#x27;t tried that and won&#x27;t, but I can&#x27;t see any reason why not (with a willing pet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Haircut Pro is a niche product, for sure.  Great for kids (and simple one-length cuts).  For anything fancier, traditional barber tools would actually be easier and result in a more pleasing cut.</li>
    <li> Yes, this thing really sucks. Not only is it terrible cutting hair, the suction is so strong that it sucked my scalp into the device. It may not be the greatest for cutting hair, however it is the best shop vac I ever owned.</li>
    <li> Defective. The power switch would not turn the unit \\&quot;on\\&quot; after only two months of light use. My hard-earned money went down the drain. I&#x27;ve thrown mine into the landfill.</li>
    <li> Razors stopped working on 3rd time to cut hair.  And I did use the oil enclosed with the product before turning it one.  There are three settings, CUT OFF and RELEASE (in case your hair gets stuck in the razors, I guess) so I did have the correct setting.  At first time I really preferred this product to the more well-known one but had to return to the more well-known competition though it doesn&#x27;t work as well with longer hair as this one is set up for.</li>
    <li> very loud need earplugs</li>
    <li> I got this for my dog...it works well but what they don&#x27;t mention is that it is wicked high pitched loud and would freak out any dog who can hear the mail man truck two streets away!  I&#x27;m working on a way to muffle the sound.</li>
    <li> Now even my husband will give me a haircut!</li>
    <li> noisy and cut not good</li>
    <li> Loud but works extremely well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am one of those guys that got a hair cut every 6 months. I would trim it myself with scissors until the back got too long. (tried cutting the back only once).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this ugly thing a try and I love it. You&#x27;ll surely screw up a time or two but once you get used to it it is easy. I am also a bit metro with my hair and always have been so I am not an anything will do hair cut kind of guy.</li>
    <li> Works great, a little hard to use by myself, would be better to have a helper on the back.</li>
    <li> I have owned and used Robocut for many years and have never had a bad haircut!  I used to go to the beautician and pay $$$ for a haircut I couldn&#x27;t wait to grow out, but now I get just what I want when I do my own.  I started with the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; Robocut and used it for years, then I decided to try the Pro model.  I really love it!  The vacuum is much stronger than any of my own household vacs and it makes a big difference.  I recommend both versions, but I prefer the Pro model.  Happy haircutting!!!</li>
    <li> Finally a hair station! Sits on table always ready for the 5 min beard trim, my almost daily routine. As easy to use as my WaterPic, not much larger, about the same body language. My 1/2 inch beard is like most, coarse and problematic to get even. Yet the suction on this thing is adequate.</li>
    <li> We,ve used the previous model for more than 30 years.  Very pleased with this all-in-one convenience.  It is loud, but I&#x27;ve always worn foam ear plugs.  I really miss having it when I travel for months and have to go out on the market for a haircut-I race home for the shower to lose the hair all over me.  I like the new buzz attachment and the new short flat grid.  It works very well, even with the suction relief port fully open.  Pays for itself in the first year and gives me a better cut that I can walk out the door with right away and not worry about itching.  Well done.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dog who was 86 out of every groomer in our area. Was skeptical at first. But, after using this product. I am so, VERY HAPPY! My dog doesn&#x27;t mind this at all and the hair cut is as good as the cut that I got from the groomers. Going to save us a ton of money and I don&#x27;t have to drug my dog to get a cut . Thanks PRO Model (Robocut)</li>
    <li> Broke on second use. Did a good job the first time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s O.K. The vacuum on hair cutter is weak making hair cutting take a while to cut the hair.&lt;br /&gt;The space where the cut hair goes in bottom is to small meaning you have to empty the&lt;br /&gt;area where the cut hair goes more then once while cutting the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Other wise the hair cutter is O.K.</li>
    <li> My husband had been using a flowbee for over 10 years. It&#x27;s a good product however with a lot of trouble of setting up and putting it away after use.&lt;br /&gt;This product solves all of that.&lt;br /&gt;Only wish we have is less noise. Don&#x27;t use it late at night, your neighbors will hate you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called the phone number on the pamphlet when I had a question.&lt;br /&gt;The man is very very nice and took time for me to explain how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and customer service :)</li>
    <li> Quite noisy.  I bought to use on my dogs but they hate the noise and so I am not able to use it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, simple to use.  Make your money back in 5 hair cuts.  Great product, wish I would have invented it.</li>
    <li> SAFETY WARNING - The vacuum is very powerful and literally sucked my husband&#x27;s scalp into the tube along with his hair. Had we been using the shortest attachment, the \\&quot;buzz cutter\\&quot;, he could have been seriously injured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had hoped to love the Haircut Pro vacuum hair cutter as my husband has wanted a [[ASIN:B000FFQ8DI Flowbee Hair Cutter]] type hair trimmer for many years. We had recently begun using the [[ASIN:B003CY0QL4 Philips Norelco Qc5130/40 Hair Clipper, Silver]] which we have quickly grown to love.  However, the longest setting on the Norelco is #12 - 1.5 inches. There are times when my husband likes his hair slightly longer so he continued to occasionally mention getting an untried but potentially beloved Flowbee. After reading the reviews of both the Flowbee and the Haircut Pro, we settled on the Haircut Pro. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a mistake...  First we noticed the very uneven cut caused by the method the hair is sucked into the tube. However, along my husband&#x27;s neckline we discovered a serious problem. The vacuum is very powerful and literally sucked my husband&#x27;s scalp into the tube along with his hair. Had we been using the shortest attachment, the \\&quot;buzz cutter\\&quot;, he could have been seriously injured. Some household canister vacuums have an airflow adjustment on the vacuum hose.  A simple modification of the hose with thorough instructions could help reduce this hazard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another potential situation I quickly noticed - if the blades became dull over a period of use and someone then used this device to cut off any substantial length of hair it appears the device could cause the hair become wound up into the rapidly spinning cutting mechanism instead of being cut.  This could become a very bad situation, very quickly.  Again, we are very concerned with the potential hazards from using this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After such a bad experience we are sticking with the Norelco Hair Clipper since it provides a much more even cut and does not have nearly the potential to cause serious harm or bodily injury. Since we purchased the Haircut Pro from Amazon we have returned it for a refund due to being defective / does not work properly. Any device with this much potential to cause serious harm or bodily injury is defective in our books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full-disclosure: We do NOT have any financial involvement in any of the above companies. We are merely consumers who have experienced too many hazards in our society, perhaps we can assist others to make informed choices.d does not have nearly the potential to cause serious harm or bodily injury.

    <li> Cut my hair 2 times easy to use and did a good job.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Only used it once so far</li>
    <li> I had a hair cutter before..not the Flowbee..but the Aircut.  Not a well know product, but it had a self contained vacuum; unfortunately since it is the size of a hair dryer, it did not have enough suction and it had those dratted Flowbee like rectangular extenders.  I have hardwood floors and have not much use for a vacuum, so I was looking for another hairncutter with a self contained vacuum. This hair cutter is so well made and so well thought out.  One can have as little or as much suction as they need for a haircut.  The You Tube video and the instructions are really helpful.  I have fine hair and used to go to the beautician for a $25 hair cut and it always ended up looking the same, one side a bit shorter than the other, etc.  This is an excellent buy for the price.  There is a bit of a learning curve when cutting my hair, but the first cut came out just fine. PLEASE do not forget to put the adapter on after setting the length.  I forgot to do so one sleepy morning and ended up with a very short haircut.  The first and second time my hair came out fine.  The third, I wasn&#x27;t paying attention and am now waiting for my hair to grow out.</li>
    <li> In 2002 I was at my cousins house when he told me that he had cut not only his hair but his three sons hair for years using a Flowbee.  For a time I watched him use it before one day trying it myself.  I must say my first attempt did not end vary well but thankfully I had an understanding hair stylist helped me out.  After going to get my hair cut a few times making appointments and after a few long waiting room I thought enough is enough.  After some research I decided on the RoboCut instead of the Flowbee in 2004 I had it shipped to my house.  Now I cut my hair whenever it is covenant for me get a quick touch up when ever that special day comes along and my full haircut takes me about 5 to 10 minutes people are always amazed when they hear that I cut my own hair and some had said that they now cut their own hair.  So get your hair cut the way you like take a few measurements  start long you can always cut more and after a few times you will get it dialed in, you can do it it’s not that hard.&lt;br /&gt;Tj</li>
    <li> A great hair cutting machine</li>
    <li> Attachments stay put, easy to use, cuts evenly, powerful vacuum, easy cleanup.  I have used it 3 times so far.  One more time and it will be more than paid for.  I am extremely happy with the product and have already recommended it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Fast ship, easy to use.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a good alternative to hair cutting, are tired of paying $30 each month (generally I need to cut my hair every 30 days), then consider the Haircut Pro Vacuum Haircutter. The entire system is automated to ensure minimum user involvement. The device has a precision dial and all the accessories needed so that you, or your hairy friend (I mean pets here) can be groomed.  The device also has a convenient travel box so you can take it with you. It pays itself in 4 months. Enjoy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Flowbee for years and saved a lot of money, time, and hassle with haircuts, but the Flowbee is getting a little worn out. Came across this and decided to try something different. So far it works good. Still getting use to it, but am getting the hang of it pretty quick. I like not having to get out the vacuum cleaner and getting everything set up like I did with the Flowbee. The adjustments on it as far the length you want to cut are fairly easy. Easier than the Flowbee was. This thing is a little noisy, but most vacuums are. It&#x27;s easy to clean hair out. There is a filter which will have hair stuck to it. I use the small, supplied brush to clean filter. Filter does seem kind of delicate and it comes with an extra one. If you have to get more I assume (haven&#x27;t checked into it) you can order. I may come up with my own design.</li>
    <li> The suction is great but it is extremely noisy. Also, the cutting blade diameter is too small to allow for ease of use. You are force to go over the same section repeatedly. Lastly, the guards can and do slide while cutting, causing uneven cuts.</li>
    <li> I used this thing 5 minutes after it got here, and, WOW!! This thing really does the job. Period. Word of advice. Oil the blades as directed. It WILL seize up if they aren&#x27;t correctly lubricated. Please spend the extra money, and buy this model. You won&#x27;t regret it. You WILL regret the cheaper models.</li>
    <li> Works for its intended purpose. Nice that I did not have to attach a separate vaccuum, clean hair cutting.. Price was good,</li>
    <li> I thought this might be something we could use in between professional haircuts, just for a quick trim, but it didn&#x27;t really work for us. Maybe there are special techniques you need to use with a trimmer like this, but the instructions that came with it are pretty spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say it would likely work well with pets, for trimming manes in the summer. We used to have a chow mix dog, with beautiful black fur that grew very quickly. It was perfect for the winter, but in the summer he got very hot and we had to trim his hair, which was quite time consuming with a buzz trimmer and scissors. Since he wasn&#x27;t entirely patient with the process, it was a bit tricky, and made for something of a mess. Something like this would have been ideal - especially because the worst part of cutting his hair was cleaning up the huge mess afterwards. With this, the hair is just vacuumed up, neatly, and you can dispose of it afterwards. Additionally, this seems to cut without pulling or yanking; the vacuum pulls hair up gently and it cuts cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t try this with people, though, unless you just want short hair and you don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s uneven. My son agreed to be a guinea pig with this, and I tried hard to get it right but in the end it looked awful and I had to take him to the local salon to get fixed up. We figured that was likely, though, so I didn&#x27;t trim his hair too much, but it still cut fairly unevenly. You&#x27;d think the vacuum would make the hair go in straight and cut all to the same length, and it is a powerful vacuum, but hair just doesn&#x27;t seem to come in evenly and so it doesn&#x27;t cut evenly. I won&#x27;t try this again on people.</li>
    <li> YES: Self contained unit&lt;br /&gt;  Dedicated On-Board Vacuum&lt;br /&gt;  Sturdy \\&quot;spacers\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;  Easy to adjust length \\&quot;on the fly\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;  More intuitive feeling when cutting (than Flowbee)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS FOR ME/MY FAMILY:  Vacuum haircutting seems to be extra-challenging with very thick and wavy/curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINAL THOUGHT:  If you are in the market for a vacuum haircutter, this would be my first choice.  The price point it a little higher, but having a self-contained unit that is tuned for this job specifically, and keeps things organized are enough pluses to warrant the extra $30 or so (according to Amazon.com price on 2/22/2012 when shipping direct from Amazon) that this costs compared to the trailblazing, but less intuitive Flowbee (the package without the vacuum)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Longer Tale...&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased a Flowbee ([[ASIN:B000FFQ8DI Flowbee Hair Cutter]] to help cut my son&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some background:  I have severe arthritis (both systemic RA and Osteoarthritis) and my son and I both have autism (Asperger&#x27;s Syndrome).  Both of us are sensitive to sound/noise.  I have been cutting his hair since he was one year old and he is just getting squirmier, which results in epic attempts to even out his cut, resulting in hair that is way shorter than intended.  Thankfully, the too short hair grows pretty quick and cutting it *that* short gives me a bit of a reprieve between cuts (around 6 months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I purchased the Flowbee to make the haircut experience go faster for both of us and to avoid using the scissors, which can be challenging and on some days just impossible with my swollen and stiff hands.  The Flowbee is fine.  I attached it to our vacuum cleaner and tested it on my bangs first. Yes, I took that bullet.  And thankfully my bangs look like they were precisely trimmed when they are pushed to one side and straight down?  Looks like a toddler took pinking sheers to my fringe!  I tried the Flowbee on him and it cut his hair, but with very thick hair I found the process very labor and time intensive and my son eventually started going into overload (he did have earplugs in) so we stopped and he had a 1980&#x27;s Mel Gibson sort of a mullet-y cut.  Not great.  Not even good. But passable for school the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He promised he would let me finish the cut with the Flowbee but both of us kept putting it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Haircut Pro from Amazon&#x27;s vine program.  I chose it because I figured I could compare it to the Flowbee, and even if it was nearly the same experience as the Flowbee at least it was different enough that my kid would let me play mad scientist with his hair once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bangs had grown out enough by this point that I first cut them- much easier than the Flowbee.  Why?  The opening is round and the footprint is small so there is a greater likelihood of cutting mostly hair from one area to the same length, than with the flowbee which grabs hair from a great area, making a straight cut nearly impossible for the \\&quot;vacuum haircutting\\&quot; newbie. The Haircut Pro feels more intuitive... Well, at least as intuitive as cutting your hair with vacuum cleaner powered spinning blades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Haircut Pro has the vacuum built in, comes with a spare filter, and plenty of attachments which lock together by turning instead of the Flowbee&#x27;s which snap together and are so flimsy feeling that I&#x27;m still amazed our one epic haircut attempt didn&#x27;t result in broken spacer bits all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum is strong enough.  With very thick hair it can be challenging to get all of the hair cut.  I wound up giving myself a fairly basic and easy blunt cut to my very long hair by gathering hair into low hanging ponytails with the elastic band pulled just above the length I wanted (to make kind of a false-scalp/anchoring point.  This worked fairly well, and while I wouldn&#x27;t say it looks like a salon cut or even a great home-cut, it is nice to get the back eventhis easily-even without buying more spacers to accommodate my very long and extremely thick hair.  My bangs came out awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son&#x27;s hair was another epic event- the Haircut Pro is gentler than the Flowbee.  The Flowbee snagged his hair and pulled it on occasion which made his patience dwindle rapidly.  The Haircut Pro didn&#x27;t jerk his scalp as much and the plastic spacers are finished a little nicer so he wasn&#x27;t as bothered by me bumping his head with them... Though I wish there was a way to make a \\&quot;cap\\&quot; for the end spacer with cushioning, but cannot imagine how that could be done without adding another place for hair to get snagged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have to use the scissors and a razor comb to shape and finish his cut.  Still, I found the Haircut Pro at least reduced the length enough to make the detail work much quicker and more manageable for me and my painful hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vacuum portion is around as loud as a regular household upright vac.  It does hold lots of clippings but we had to empty it twice during our experimental cut as both of us have very thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son&#x27;s hair is also curly/very wavy and he has cowlicks all over his head which makes any cut challenging.  I&#x27;m still surprised he let me cut his hair with both this and the Flowbee when he is terrified of our electric clippers (they make a weird loud sound when adjusting them)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Haircut Pro kit came with a helpful haircut guide and a \\&quot;hairline\\&quot; gadget that is one of the coolest things I have ever seen.  It&#x27;s a bendable \\&quot;template\\&quot; so folks with short hair can easily shape and trim and clean up the back nape of their cuts.  I don&#x27;t know if it was supposed to be in the box, as the description here on Amazon didn&#x27;t mention it, and the little box that it was in (within the larger haircut pro kit box) said \\&quot;Robocut\\&quot;...  But it is a pretty neat \\&quot;why didn&#x27;t I think of that!\\&quot; device and next time I trim my bangs, I&#x27;m going to give that handy little gadget a try (and then back to the Haircut Pro for my bang trims!)...wesome.

    <li> We were replacing a Flowbee that was old and making bad sounds. Bought this and didn&#x27;t get around to using it for several weeks and when we did it was not cutting cleanly but pulled the hair. Too late to return it, Probably try to find another flowbee.</li>
    <li> Used this on my son and used it for just a few seconds and the blades stopped spinning.  I would have to oil the blades every little bit just so they would continue to spin.  Does not cut very good even when blade is spinning.</li>
    <li> I love this cutter!  I have used it several times now and am gradually modifying how I use it to get just the haircut I want.  I love the no-hair-cleanup!  I&#x27;ve had numerous compliments on my haircut and an acquaintance bought one after she watched me use it on my father in a nursing home.  I also plan to use it on one of my dogs who always looks shaggy, if she doesn&#x27;t freak out.  It IS rather loud, but not terribly bad.  My hands are arthritic, so I have a little difficulty getting the base off to clean out the hair and filter, but I manage.</li>
    <li> Well when i order it, i thought it was supose to be new. .but it was&#x27;t  I went ahead and kept it, instead of all the troble of shipping it  back.It cuts alright,but be careful it will suck the skin into it,</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit 2/1/12 and have used it twice, once on myself and once on one of my wigs. As I wear wigs all the time, I still needed help with cutting the sides and front of my hair, which show outside of the wigs. The unit worked very well for this purpose. I, also, became brave enough to use it to shape up the back of one of my wigs (while on my head) and it worked well for that also. I really like the portability of this unit. I have had experience with a hair cutter that attached to a vacumn cleaner. This made that unit very cumbersome plus you needed to be sure the vacumn had enough power to pull the hair into the cutter. This unit is great with it&#x27;s own vacumn, takes up very little counter space, and clean-up is fairly easy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Robocut for over 10 years and by my calculations, saved nearly $2500 and hundreds of hours driving to and sitting at the barber shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately all current Robocuts are made in communist China and the quality is a reflection.  My old made in USA model, which I&#x27;ve had over 10 years never game me any trouble until the past few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first ordered a red model and it broke the minute I turned it.  The plastic was bent on it so I sent it back.  I ordered a pro model and it arrived broken - would not power on.  I made one call to Alfred, the owner, and he promptly shipped a replacement out.  The replacement works fine and I am pleased with the prompt service I received from Robocut.  The plastic on the pro model seems much more rigid than the red model.  I recommend the pro model for this reason plus you don&#x27;t need a vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As per the suction issue, it&#x27;s true it is way too strong, however that is easily remedied.  There is a plastic cover about the size of a quarter where the wire goes into the hose on the vacuum end.  Just take a small screwdriver and pop that cover off.  It will reduce the suction to a much more tolerable level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would gladly pay double for a made in USA model that was more durable and UL listed.  I have my fingers crossed that this chinese model will hold up.</li>
    <li> This thing really seems to work.  No, I can&#x27;t say that I have done a perfect haircut with it, yet, but I out-performed the fat girl at Great Clips, or whatever their name was.  She inspired me to try this.  Thank you, fat girl!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well at all. Gave a choppy cut, suction was not powerful enough.</li>
    <li> A little bit noisy...like standing next to a jet aircraft while it is running, but on the other hand it does not make a mess, and gives a decent haircut. Just bring earplugs. I like it!</li>
    <li> after using this item 4 times, I found that if I do not watch myself in the mirror, I get a very even cut. if you go by feel going back and forth over your scalp, you will get good results. I found it is also good for trimming chest hair! I use ear plugs to reduce the noise, and that helps me take my time while cutting my hair. I definitely recommend this product. again, I recommend ear plugs for your own comfort.</li>
    <li> We own several \\&quot;Robocuts\\&quot;. This should say a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whichever country we are in -where we have a house- we want to have a Robocut to leave behind.This is similar to having a refrigerator, vacuum cleaner, furniture... and so on in every house...Robocut is part of the ESSENTIALS. Robocut is part of our household.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use Robocut since 1994, therefore we are loyal customers of the product as well as the company. Dr. Alfred Natrasevschi, the owner of the company and the engineer as the creative brain behind the product goes out of his way to accommodate and provide help for the needs of the customer. We do not know him in person, however, over the years we have talked over the phone asking him to produce different size extensions. He makes sure to understand the client need and delivers the product without delay. What a quality presence...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Alfred Natrasevschi goes out of his way -the professional that he is- to find solutions for particular needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For us going to hairdressers and paying huge sums of money are a thing of the past. Besides, there is no hairdresser that can give this precise a haircut. And all is done within 2-3 minutes maximum!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saving us money, time as well as  anxiety as to what the end result would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it without reservation. Also make sure to enter comments to Amazon so that ROBOCUT never goes out of production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were so impressed with the creator that we told him we would buy stocks if he ever went public ... we are waiting :)))</li>
    <li> If you own dogs you know how expensive grooming can become. I now have 6 dogs that require grooming 5 of my own and 1 that I foster for the humane society. I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to make those trips to and from the groomers not to mention the cost for each dog. These clippers are so easy to use even for a first timer. Just be careful around areas that can be sucked into clippers, if you are using these on dogs read instructions on this first they are I the owners manual. These clippers leave virtually no mess to clean up. With regular clippers by the time I got done I had more hair on me than the dogs had on them. And with regular clippers the dogs were jumpy and clipper shy and didn&#x27;t like the vibration. They actually like the vacuum feel of these clippers. The replacement blades are not costly and are fairly easy to replace, blades stay sharp for a good period of time, just remember to oil them regular while in use (instructions on this in in the owner manual). I hope this has helped you in your choice of haircutting tool. Can&#x27;t do with mine!</li>
    <li> For the past year or so I&#x27;ve noticed that the local place where I usually get hair cuts is often without customers, and I think it is because people are buying products like this or Flowbee since they are so easy to use and doing it yourself at home does save a lot of money over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to this, as I was before getting this as my first vacum hair cutting product, you can do a web search on things like &#x27;robocut hair video&#x27; or &#x27;flowbee video&#x27; and watch demo videos showing how these work. You can easily find videos showing how to do hair styling for men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For men who are nearly bald or want a shaved head, I&#x27;d recommend not using any vacum suction product because these will pull in bare skin and can cause damage if the blades are too close, as some other reviewers here have reported. Traditional shavers and clippers should be used instead. The same applies to pets; always be sure that blades do not come into direct contact with bare skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this directly from the Haircut web site because the price was cheaper and they offer a 60 day money back guarantee, as well as a 2 year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can cut my own hair in a few minutes, and it honestly looks better than some professional cuts I&#x27;ve had in the past. There is also no messy cleanup because all of the hair is sucked directly into the vacum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacum seems to be well built and will hopefully run a few years without the need for replacing any parts, including the need to use the 2 extra spare filters that come in the package. Be sure to read and follow the directions for care and use, and things should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just watch the videos and read the instructions carefully to get started, and then to get the hang of it you can do it with settings that cut very little hair. Once you get comfortable with that, it will be easy for you to increase the cut lengths as you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good product that works as advertised, so you might want to give it a try.ised, so you might want to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have used this unit few times to cut my hair and also by son&#x27;s hair; it worked great. The vacuum component was a little stronger on me, but for my son who has thick hair, it didn&#x27;t do such a good job. Overall the product is well made and it came with easy to follow instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Automatic haircutter with vacuum built in, and comes with a spare filter&lt;br /&gt;* No setup needed; just  plug and style; easy to replace the cartridges that contain the blades&lt;br /&gt;* Strong and well built; comes with Two year warranty&lt;br /&gt;* Universal voltage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t work well for thick or long hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. [[ASIN:B000FFQ8DI Flowbee Hair Cutter]]&lt;br /&gt;2. [[ASIN:B005HEL53A \\&quot;AIR CUTTER\\&quot; TRIM AND VACUUM YOUR HAIR WITH NO MESS! (AS SEEN ON TV!)]]</li>
    <li> When I took this out of the box I thought it looked more like a sump pump.It has many attachments and is bright blue.I was intimidated by it&#x27;s size,and where to store it. The cutter is paired with a suction that somehow causes an uneven cutting or trim job.I have read here that it has been dangerous to use on humans because of the suction strength.I had to take heed as it is humans I wanted to use it on ,not pets!&lt;br /&gt;I have to say,this product sucks too much!</li>
    <li> Lasted for three cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Blades stopped rotating. Poor design with plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t fall for the warranty. They will never respond to it.</li>
    <li> Works well and with the 2 year warranty a good deal. Surprising how easy it is to use. I would suggest that if you decide to layer your hair have your spouse or friend work with you. While one person can do it, it is easier and more accurate to have someone else layer in the back of the head. The unit is large with the vacuum so you will need to consider where to store it.</li>
    <li> I have used a flow bee since 1993 and this far passed it. No more do I have to get out the shop vac find two out let&#x27;s close together to run both the flow and the vac. Now I just get  my little blue cutter and away I go. Good product.</li>
    <li> I have agonized over hair cutting for my two dogs a lab Aussie mix and border collie . I followed all instructions to a T and after five minutes of use started smelling a burning and dog started crying . Sent back .</li>
    <li> In some ways it is better than the flowbee and in someways it is not I am still playing with it. It definitely did the sides better but the top goes faster with the wider flowbee.</li>
    <li> The Robocut is great!  I started out with the Flowbee about nine years and have graduated to the Robocut because of the suctioning vacuum cleaner.  We do about 7 haircuts a month here at our home and the Robocut continues to hold up time and time again.  On top of it all the customer service is fantastic and they make good on their 2 year warranty should anything break.  I give Robocut 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Bulky, does not cut nearly as well as the Flowbee haircutting system that I had for over 20 years that finally broke but thought I&#x27;d try something new.  HA!  One haircut the filter inside was completely clogged up so there was not nearly enough suction to cut my hair, so I opened it to clean it out, there was some sort of grease in there, hair was stuck to everything.  Paid a ton to return it when I could have sent it myself through USPS much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;prefer to give NO stars but the Hate it with one star works pretty well for me.  Staying with the Flowbee.</li>
    <li> 1st time user, love the Haircut Pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can never get the correct cut from a hairdresser because I have naturally curly/wavy hair, the shorter it is cut while wet, the more curly and therefore Shorter it is when dry - try convincing a hairdresser to cut longer than they think because the length will shrink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Started with too long hair for the style I like to wear. Did not know if the Haircut Pro would have strong enough suction to handle the length, but it did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use another brand small product for my father&#x27;s hair, which is very short &amp; just needs trimming tinme to time.  Have cut my hair with this &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; product - the suction is not strong enough for longer hair so the cut (cut my hair twice) came out both times very uneven &amp; cutting would take forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Haircut Pro I was able to cut to the length I wanted, and quickly.  As well the style instruction book was very helpful - I learned to do the layered cut, in my case with a little extra length - the very cut I could not get hairdressers to do for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For women who want a bit longer hair (not short), suggest cutting longer than you actually want, wash &amp; dry, see how it looks, go from there.</li>
    <li> In contrast to the other reviews, where everyone gloats over the RoboCut, I would like to add a few caveats:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Before cutting your hair with RoboCut, make sure you watch the YouTube videos that shows you what to do. Just go to YouTube and search for RoboCut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. First time you cut your hair, only take off a quarter inch or less. You won&#x27;t notice the difference until you take a shower, comb out your hair, and then let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Make sure you oil the blades after cutting your hair. You can purchase more oil through RoboCut or you can buy a small can of 3-in-1 oil at any hardware store. The 3-in-1 oil is the less expensive alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Wear ear plugs while cutting your hair as this machine is LOUD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. If at any time you hear the cutting motor slow down, then stop the machine and add oil to the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. To empty the RoboCut of hair clippings, you must take off the bottom of the unit as the instruction manual shows. However, what they don&#x27;t show is HOW TO GET RID OF ALL THE HAIR CLIPPINGS! I found the best way is to have a vacuum cleaner near by and then suck all the hair clippings out of the RoboCut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RoboCut does a good job although I was happier with my Original FlowBee that I bought back in 1990. Unfortunately I lost it in a house fire and I did not like the new style FloBee machines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 10, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took away one STAR because I have to oil the blades on the RoboCut three or four times as often as I had to oil the FloBee blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;November 17, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am REDUCING my RATING by another STAR because I noticed there are cracks in several of the PLASTIC pieces that come with the unit. This is UNACCEPTABLE as I have only owned the unit 6 MONTHS and only used it 6 TIMES. I SHOULD NOT have to REPLACE the PLASTIC parts after 6 USES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;January 17, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reducing the RATING by another STAR as the main plastic piece called the \\&quot;PRECISION DIAL\\&quot; broke and it will cost $11 to replace. At this point I wish I had bought the FlowBee instead. As I stated earlier, I have not used this device many times.IAL\\&quot; broke and it will cost $11 to replace. At this point I wish I had bought the FlowBee instead. As I stated earlier, I have not used this device many times.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the thought that it probably would not work, but it DOES!!  My hair was probably 5-6 inches long and layered and I started with the 2&amp;#34; attachment.  It took several minutes of going over and over with the attachment for it to cut all of my hair.  Allowing large sections of hair to be pulled up are not as successful as smaller sections but it does it.  Very pleased with this!!  I have recommended to friends already.</li>
    <li> This machine has a lot of potential.  Maybe it was just the one I received, but the vacuum quit after the first use and I called the manufacturer who promised to send me a replacement .... that was months ago.  I bought a flowbee in the meantime and it has worked perfect everytime since.  Sorry Charlie.</li>
    <li> It cuts hair good.  Comes in a weird box. It seems to work ok.</li>
    <li> I bought a Robocut about six months ago to use on my wife. She is not able to get out of the house much so I thought this little device would be what I needed to cut and trim her hair from time to time. Before I could use it on her we were out one day and I took her to the salon and got her hair cut so I did not get to try it out on her. Robo sat in the corner for a few more months while I got my hair cut by my favorite barber. My favorite barber went his way so I tried another barber which did not cut my hair like my favorite barber. So a few weeks went by, now and then eyed poor sad Robo in the corner feeling depressed. I watched Robo&#x27;s videos over and over until I was sure I knew what I was doing then I took the plunge and plugged Robo into a socket and pushed his on button. I came out with a hair cut just as good as my favorite barber without leaving the house. Robo and I are in love and we owe it all to you, thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.&lt;br /&gt;I went with the tapered style haircut starting with the &amp;#34;TELESCOPING DIAL&amp;#34; set at inch and a quarter for the top of head zone 1. Then added &amp;#34;#10 TAPER&amp;#34; attachment set for one inch at zone 2, then still using &amp;#34;#10 taper&amp;#34; set for 3/4 inch for zone 3. Finished off Zone 4 with the &amp;#34;SHORT HAIR ONLY&amp;#34; attachment set for 1/2 inch around ears and neck line. These setting gives a nice close cut especially for old guys. Be good to have the hair line tool for cleaning up back of hair line, wouldn&#x27;t hurt to have a good trimmer for eyebrows, sideburns, ears, nose and wherever else hair grows.</li>
    <li> Bought this when my local Great Clips closed hoping to DYI instead of finding a new place to butcher my hair.  Within 15 minutes of opening the box, I had a clean finished haircut!  Easy to use, even came with a guide for a few hairstyles.  Seems to be made well so I&#x27;m hoping it will last.  I cut my sister&#x27;s hair also &amp; she liked it so much she bought her own.  Now I will have a consistent cut without the hassles!</li>
    <li> Does not work like advertised. Very difficutl to get cut right.</li>
    <li> The first unit arrived  and worked for 30 seconds! Amazon dispatched a replacement instantly. The replacement arrived in two days and did a great job! Time will tell about the durability.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is a good company to deal with on line. The packaging could have been better.</li>
    <li> I bought my first Robo-cut in 2006 with the optional attached blue vacuum - that was obviously a modified small commercial vac.  Have not been to the barber since 2006 and I love it.  It still works perfectly but 8 years is enough and I decided to try the new model.  Its more compact and will be easier to store under my bathroom sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new model works great.  Not really many changes in 8 years which means they pretty much got it right the first time.  The attachments now have a slot and the oil is in a squeeze tube instead of a small bottle.  That&#x27;s about it except for the upgraded stand up vac which I now place on the bathroom counter instead of on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men with male pattern baldness take note:  When I went to the barber I was always dismayed as they seemed to cut one side shorter that the other.  With the Robocut that problem disappears.  I use the desired setting around my entire half circle of hair, trim around the ears with my shaver extension, and then trim the back of my neck with an electric shaver viewing with double mirrors.  I have it down to a science that I perform every 3 or 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you like driving to the barber shop every month, waiting your turn and then shelling our $20 for 5 minutes work (at least for my minimalist hair) Robocut is not for you.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using the Robocut for the past 11 years because it really works and gives a great, professional haircut. It has saved us hundreds of dollars in salon costs. The Buzz cut adapter is great for the shorter &amp;#34;spikey&amp;#34; look and the extenders work great for longer hair. It&#x27;s super convenient and easy to use. The customer service is very prompt with your orders and always helpful and courteous!</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair &amp; am 59 years old.  I&#x27;ve cut my own hair before &amp; have paid low &amp; high prices at salons over the years. When I did cut my own hair, the stress &amp; clean up were not fun at all.  I bought all kinds of tricks to help...  none of which did much good.  Finally, I came across this vacuum hair cutting system while searching the web. Through my research, I chose the RoboCut Pro because of it&#x27;s versatility, great warranty &amp; good customer reviews.  When I got it, I started out with extensions that would cut off an eighth of an inch... It did NOT pull, tear or break my hair at all!!! It CUT that eighth of an inch off perfectly!!!  It wasn&#x27;t long before I gained confidence with this system &amp; learned to use the taper &amp; extension attachments to my advantage.  Now I have a pattern I follow.  Using that pattern with 3 different attachments, RoboCut Pro cuts my hair beautifully each time!!!  Both sides are perfectly even &amp; is the exact style I am looking for.  I complete my hair cut within less than 30 minutes with NO clean up at all!!! Now, I LOVE my RoboCut Pro!!! I can not say enough good about this hair cutting system.  The quality &amp; design of the machine is excellent &amp; the customer service is stellar!!! It is easy to use &amp; the filter tray is super easy to empty.  I will NEVER use any other hair cutting system again!! I&#x27;ve gotten SO many compliments on my hair!!  I am proud to recommend the RoboCut Pro without hesitation to anyone who is sick of paying the high prices at salons &amp; is willing to try something unique, super easy to use, saves money &amp; will make you proud of your own accomplishments!!! I am SUPER glad I gave it a try!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Robocut (Haircut Pro Vacuum Haircutter) for a very long time now and it has been great for me and my family, I think it would be shocking if I added up how much money is has probably saved our family over the years.  I started out back in early 90&#x27;s with the Flowbee and went thru 2 of those before discovering the Robocut.  While they both did a good job with my hair the Flowbee was VERY loud and honestly just didn&#x27;t hold up well to monthly use.  When my kids were younger they constantly complained about the Flowbee noise and didn&#x27;t like it - that has been no problem with the Robocut.  My kids have grown up using it and now they cut their own hair with it.  At $15-25 a pop for a haircut this will pay for itself in a manner of a few months.  The other thing I like about it is that I don&#x27;t have to make an appointment - I can get it out and be done in just a few minutes.  My kids are older now and about to leave the nest and I will more than likely buy them one to take with them when they leave (or maybe just give them mine and get me a new one).  It is just a smart all around investment.</li>
    <li> Gave it to my son as a gift he likes it.</li>
    <li> Really not good for shorter hair. I keep my hair 1.5 inch long (Male). I taper down on the sides and back using clippers. I bought this thinking it would suck the hair in then cut evenly. It does just that on 1 inch or longer but is useless on shorter lengths such as the sides and back. This would work great for you if you have, say a 3 inch hair style.&lt;br /&gt;*As a side note, seeing how this works it is very likely to cause split ends (if you have long hair and care about that), I dont.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This makes a mess of a simple haircut. I used this product one time and now it sits in the garage; I doubt it will ever be used again.</li>
    <li> The unit uses paper filters which means I have to purchase more filters.  The filters are only good for one time use.  If I cut my hair more than allotted filters then the unit is unusable.  This is unacceptable and ridiculous!!! On top of that the filters are small.</li>
    <li> Complete waste of money... Instead of cutting my dogs hair it suck up her skin so bad she was crying. Now she won&#x27;t let anyone cut her hair. Thank you for that...</li>
    <li> This product was shipped FAST, cut my Hair WONDERFULLY, easy to use, easy to set the hair lengths, easy to clean.  The unit is quiet and powerful all at the same time.  I should have bought this SOONER and I could have saved tons of money and had fun at the same time!!!&lt;br /&gt;Remember easy and fun to give yourself a hair cut whit the PRO model.</li>
    <li> Works very good. Vacuum adj. still not right, you should be able to lower the suction power. Blades also should spin faster, but overall worked well.</li>
    <li> I have R28 Robocut Pro model with vacuum Haircutter since 2001. I have not been to a barber since I bought this. It paid for itself after the first year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It took me a couple times to learn how best to cut my hair. I cut the length of my hair top and back first using only one extension. Then trim up the sides and the back with and angle adapter moving it progressively closer. Cutting the top and back move the cutter back and forth side to side it cuts the length nice and even. I&#x27;ve only had to replace the cutting blade once. I oil the blades before every hair cut. Flip the switch to \\&quot;sharpen\\&quot; for 10 seconds after every use will always give good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely highly recommend this product, its quality and longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone thinks that the Flowbee is the best. I had one hair cut with a Flowbee and that was the last one it pulled my hair terrible.</li>
    <li> It stopped working today after about 2 months. The blades were oiled properly and it was not used excessively. I&#x27;ve contacted the seller, but haven&#x27;t heard anything yet. If I do, I will update the review. Disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a replacement from the company. The customer service was very good. I raised my rating to 3 stars. Hopefully it continues working.</li>
    <li> I have been a customer for 20 years,I have several people ask who my barber is,I can cut my hair at any time and be 100% happy with the results,which is something I could not do with a barber.quality of product is 1st class,service from company is 1st class...I have not been to a barber for 20 years,,how does that sound for a really good investment.....</li>
    <li> This is my second Robocut ,This pro version with the included auto start vacuum  is very convenient and powerful. Works just like my last one ...over 10yrs of use and not once did I have to go to a barber to fix a mistake....</li>
    <li> This has already paid for itself. It is easy to use and fast. Once you learn how to use it and maneuver it, gives pretty good haircuts. Glad we got it.</li>
    <li> I have used Flobees for the last 10 to 20 years(?) and have had great results. The is unit is just as good only smaller, which is good because we travel a lot and take it with us.</li>
    <li> I purchased the haircut pro about a month ago. Until now, for the past 2 years, I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair but with a Wahl clippers with various attachments which does allow you to achieve the desired hair length. But I&#x27;d always been attracted to the flow-bee type technology. So I went online and found both the flow-bee and the Haircut Pro. So glad I selected the HC Pro. It takes me about 10 - 15 minutes to give myself a complete haircut (medium length hair), including doing the back. I struggled with cutting the back properly when i was using the hand clippers. Not anymore. HP Pro makes it easy. I have recommended this to several friends. Great machine. If the noise bothers you, wear earplugs but don&#x27;t use that as a reason to return it. If you practice a little you&#x27;ll get very good at it. I&#x27;m not sure whether I get more of a kick out the money I save ($22 per haircut when going to the pros - who never get it right - 12 haircuts a year @$22 &#x3D; saving of $250+ per year), or the fact that I&#x27;m doing it myself. My hair has lots of growth patterns going this way and that - HC Pro handles them effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, give this product a try.</li>
    <li> This is the very first time I&#x27;ve ever submitted a review for a product, here on Amazon or anywhere else for that matter. Why, you might ask, did I choose to give my virginity to a home haircut device? The answer is simple: this product is just so good and I&#x27;ve become so dependent on using it in the past two years that I don&#x27;t want to think about having to do without one. I&#x27;m writing this review hoping that this effort will help to bolster sales and keep the Haircut.com company in business for as long as I can. I am a &#x27;professional perfectionist&#x27; . . . I have been a photo retoucher serving the advertising industry since 1978, long before Photoshop devalued the occupation. Trained in Fine Art and skilled with brushes, razorblades, bleaches and dyes we would &#x27;correct&#x27; images to accomplish Madison Avenue&#x27;s visual ideals. As a result, I never had a haircut that I didn&#x27;t go home and &#x27;tweak&#x27; until I was satisfied. I had tried cutting it myself in the past but found that it was just easier to let a &#x27;professional&#x27; do the heavy lifting and then finesse it myself afterwards. And then came the &#x27;Aha!&#x27; moment: during a haircut at my favorite shop, my haircutter got a call on her cell phone. Being a &#x27;senior&#x27; operator, she held the phone at arm&#x27;s length , squinting to see who was calling (if you&#x27;re over 50 you know what I mean, and if not you&#x27;ll find out eventually). After the call she went back to working on my hair, without the glasses that she obviously needed for close work. I began to look for a way to cut her loose and do the whole job myself. Fortunately I found the Robocut from Haircut.com. The product is very well designed and manufactured and has given me consistently great results for over 2 years. I&#x27;ve become so dependent on it for appointment free, predictable results without having to deal with any salon prima donnas that I hope to be able to get parts well into the future. I should also mention that due to the vacuum component the method is virtually free of any cleanup. When friends comment that my hair looks good and I tell them my method they look at me in amazement and say, &amp;#34;You did that with a Flowbee&amp;#34;? I say , &amp;#34;No, it&#x27;s a Robocut&amp;#34;! So try it, and I hope you like it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> changed my mind! not 5 stars This tears the hair rather than cut it. And it dies not do a good job with thick hair. I am returning and keeping my FLOWBEE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original 5 star review&lt;br /&gt;I have struggled with Flowbee for 3 years-the flimsy spacers, a burnt out vacuum in one year and totally blunt, square head hair cuts. I am no styling genius; so I bear some of the responsibility.  Today I received the Haircut Pro Vacuum Haircutter, and the difference between it and the  Flowbee is like between night and day. This is a sturdy, compact system. The spacers are sturdy and just so easy to use.T hey actually have measurements on them so you know how many inchess you are dealing with. Gee, what a concept.  The haircut seemed to feather my hair at the ends so everything seemed to lie down in place rather than be blunt and squared off. I am literally so happy I could cry. Do yourself a favor and get this system. It is great.</li>
    <li> I had a different brand for many years when it finally gave out.  Took a chance and ordered this one.  When I finally stopped &#x27;fighting&#x27; it and just let it do it&#x27;s job I really was happy with this purchase.  I use at least once a month.  The idea of having the vacuum built in makes setting up and using so much faster.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I have cut my hair three times already. I did not have to make an appointment to get my haircut and drive 15 miles either. I save about $20.00 per haircut. I can highly recommend the Robo-Cut.</li>
    <li> First Duke was scared but the second time I trimmed him, he was more relaxed knowing that it isn&#x27;t going to hurt him!  I have nicked and cut him so many times with clippers and couldn&#x27;t stand the mess afterwards.  Now, I can get him done in 10 minutes his hair is perfect and with VERY LITTLE cleanup!  Thank God for this haircutter.  I am now working on my husband to use this for his body hair.  Well, one hurdle at a time.</li>
    <li> Works great! I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair all of my adult life and its so hard to do this type of haircut on my own head with scissors and mirrors. I have short hair right now because I tired of it and gave it a clipper cut, but I am growing it out and I just gave it it&#x27;s first trim with the Haircut Pro. It was so incredibly easy (no stress) and fast, and no mess! No itchy hair stuck to me! It gave a better looking cut than the clippers!! It did NOT pull my hair. No pulling! It was gentle and smooth, but kind of loud (its a vacuum cleaner). As per the instructions (and my experience with clippers), I oiled the blades before I used it. Always oil your blades before use! So far, I am very happy with this product. I recommend it to the do-it-yourselfers.</li>
    <li> Ok so I&#x27;ve used this thing a dozen times.  It is noisy.  I knew that my haircut wasn&#x27;t going to be barber quality at least until we really got the hang of this thing.  My dad goes with a one length cut so that is easy.  We are slowly learning and getting braver.  I feel like I have gotten my money&#x27;s worth.  We were paying $10-15/ cut.  After a month of using this product, the money we saved not going to the barber has paid for itself.  And we will only keep saving as we keep using it.  I did get teased and made fun of when I first said I wanted to buy a hair cutting vacuum.  It seems products like these were big in the 80s.  Well I recommend it, even if it is unconventional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[27yr old relative of account holder]</li>
    <li> would order from again, A++++</li>
    <li> It is super great. I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I cannot speak about the latest model, however over the years I have purchased two RoboCut Machines and maybe a half dozen replacement blades...  the secret to a good haircut is maintaining a sharp cutter blade and powerful vacuum suction.</li>
    <li> This gadget does exactly what they say it will do. I&#x27;ve read many reviews here, complaining about too much suction,&lt;br /&gt;blades don&#x27;t cut well, can&#x27;t get all the hair out of the filter, etc. I guess those people did not read the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Too much suction -- there is a suction adjustment just like on a vacuum cleaner. If it sucks too hard, reduce the suction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Blades don&#x27;t cut well -- probably you are trying to cut too much at once.  I took off a quarter to half and inch, no problem at al.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Can&#x27;t get all the hair out -- the instructions clearly say, dump out the hair and don&#x27;t worry about hair remaining in the filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some folks complained about the plastic extenders breaking...it&#x27;s too soon for me to comment about that, as I&#x27;ve only used it one time.&lt;br /&gt;But I was prepared for a nightmare scenario, and really it was very easy to get a good-looking haircut.  I like it!</li>
    <li> This thing is THE BOMB.  I only wish I would of purchased this sooner.  It&#x27;s so easy to just cut your own hair when you don&#x27;t feel like taking the time and expense to go to the salon. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am a truckdriver with little time to spare, I have 2 mutts .Robocuts works for me .I have had my unit for 2 years for my mutts .I am happy,unit started pulling my dogs hair lately. Was told by techs I need new blades . Brought 3 replacement blades because this prouduct really works for me.product saves me money and my mutts trusts me more than dog salons .</li>
    <li> Great alternative to barber. Be sure add clipper oil before EVERY haircut.&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely thick hair, and it tended to pull a little bit when I hadn&#x27;t oiled.</li>
    <li> I have used Robo-Cut for nearly a year and I am so pleased with how it cuts my naturally wavy hair.  I use one length for the back and sides and then a shorter length for the top.  My waves fall into place perfectly and I have a good haircut every time.  This so easy to use! A haircut takes less than 5 minutes.  I like being able to do it myself at the time I want.  If you have wavy hair, you might want to give this a try.  Customer service was great...my machine arrived with a cracked attachment and they replaced it immediately.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  Been using 3 months to cut my own hair.  Before that, I used scissors and hair trimmers to cut my own hair.  Could never get it looking right or natural.  With this, you can literally cut your own hair perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not gonna lie to you, you are not gonna get the exact $50 haircut at your salon but you are definitely gonna be able to cut your own hair and save a ton of money.</li>
    <li> Save your money. I thought I could trim my hair and beard myself easier and neater than with standard clippers. I was wrong. You have to endlessly go over the same area to get all the hair cut somewhat evenly. It&#x27;s very noisy, awkward to use and difficult to get a reasonable trim. Maybe with 2 people.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  Great suction, no need to attach to a vacuum, and cuts really well.  Very happy with it.  I have longer, stringy type hair, and this thing works great on that type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a flowbee before this (yeah yeah, I know, its not about the money, I just can&#x27;t stand going into a barber/salon) and this is significantly better.</li>
    <li> The machine works fabulously. I have cut four different heads of hair with no problem.  Works great and saves money. Keep blades lubed.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it.. Now he can cut his own hair.</li>
    <li> Works well, was shipped quickly and is just as described.  I am not sure if we will buy another when this one wears out as it is very noisy!</li>
    <li> I had a Flowbee for about 15 years and cut all my boys&#x27; hair (5 boys) and husband&#x27;s. It was time to replace it and the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; flow bee got such horrible reviews, I decided to try this one. I am not very impressed. It is convenient to not have to get both the unit and the vacuum out to use it, but it is almost as loud as both motors running - maybe even louder because the hose isn&#x27;t as long as the vacuum hose that makes it closer to my ear. It takes me about twice as long to cut my husband&#x27;s and kids&#x27; hair as with my old Flowbee.  The last time I cut my husband&#x27;s hair, it caught his necklace and cut it to shreds!  It is much more dangerous - I never had any issue like that with the attachments being so &amp;#34;open&amp;#34;.  The Flowbee blade goes side to side and there are many blades in a row (maybe 12?) and this one is a circle and the blade spins. I don&#x27;t like the design - it doesn&#x27;t work as well.  I&#x27;ll use this for a year and get my $s worth, then I will try another Flowbee, even with the awful reviews.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. I have short hair, so no problems. Pays for itself I 6 months</li>
    <li> this machine does an excellent job, my husband loves it, its easy and does a great haircut, and as always we got Amazons wonderful customer service and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> My neighbor complemented my hair and I told her I cut it myself. She has complained how sometimes her hair is cut too short or left too long, so I started the robocuts on her hair. After getting a second cutting with the same perfect length, she has told her hairdresser that from now on, robocut  will be doing her haircutting. I often get remarks of how my hair is always so nicely cut. I have never regretted this purchase, and now couldn&#x27;t possibly imagine myself without a robocut.</li>
    <li> I thought this would save time on my dog grooming. It doesn&#x27;t cut as well as advertised. I will stick with scissors. The &amp;#34;scaredy cat&amp;#34; grooming scissors are great</li>
    <li> I owned the first version of the robocut.  This is an improvement on the first one that I had. I used to have to drag out a separate vacuum cleaner to use it.  I was sceptical that this smaller vacuum would be strong enough to do the job.  NOT TO WORRY...  There is way more than enough suction!  This little vacuum moves more air than the old canister vacuum i used to use.  My only beef with this is that the clear extensions do not lock into each other well enough for my taste.  The distance can change too easily if you bump it up against your heard hard enough.  And NO.  It&#x27;s not that my wife is right and that I have such a hard head either! LOL  It&#x27;s just that they slip around a little too freely. This issue was easily enough cured with a piece of tape or two to add some friction on the barrel so that it is harder to move them.  So, for this reason, I gave less than a perfect 5 star.  As far as the haircutting performance, I can only say that I no longer feel the need to waste money and time going to a stylist.  The robocut is the ONLY way to go for me.</li>
    <li> I am a women with short hair and this does as good a job as the beautician. I do trim up my ears up with a trimmer, because it is easier for me.; In the long run this will save me a lot of money betwenn paying for the cut and the gas to get there.</li>
    <li> First one came with the wrong plug.  Instead of a small and one large plug heads, it had two large heads, thus would not fit in any outlet.  Their answer, file it off.  When refused, they sent out a new base.  The filters fall apart, the blade moves slow.  It does cut as advertised.  I got 4 haircuts before it shorted out and quit working.  Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love it!...............Just got this today and used it to cut my own hair. I&#x27;ve used the Flowbee before but found this one much easier and faster. I especially like that it has its own vacuum which made setup and cleanup much faster and easier. I have very thick hair which I wear short so I usually need to go for a haircut every month. This is going to save me a lot of time and money and my husband said my hair looks as good as when I have it cut at the salon! I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
    <li> Very easy to operate. The instructions give you ideas on how to cut your hair to the style you want. Cuts even and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair to the point where it gets stuck in the blades. I just select a section and move the device up and down a few times to cut the hair evenly. Love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased on of these Robocutters directly from Haircut.com and used it about 5 times over the course of their warranty. I have an older Robocut and a Flowbee. The last time I used my new Robocut, the housing cracked around the blade. I was able to take out the blade and put it in my old Robocut and finish cutting, thought the older unit runs very slow. I noticed my older unit had a thicker wall surface in the tube that holds the blade and rear motor assembly. Unfortunately, my old unit has a glued in  motor, so I cannot swap out the motors.    I contacted these guys three times to find out if they could do something or if they had a higher end model I could purchase, so I would not have this problem again. I really liked this unit for certain situations, but they have never gotten back to me and just blew me off. This product is inferior to Flowbee and is also inferior to my old tired Robocut. Do NOT Buy This garbage.</li>
    <li> Product did not cut hair&lt;br /&gt;Waist of money  tried all of the setting all it did was pull hair and make split ends</li>
    <li> The vacuum is extremely loud.  I&#x27;d say as loud as a large shop vac.  The cutter spins slowly and is not very sharp.  This makes cutting extremely slow and inconsistent.</li>
    <li> ok were the hair goes not enough space, took forever to cut my dogs hair. i ended up giving up and taking trimmers after my dogs</li>
    <li> This product lasted from (12/2013- 5/2014)  5 months,and within that time I cut my hair 7 times, and it was broken.</li>
    <li> Your reviews are as phony as a three dollar bill</li>
    <li> The size and design of this vacuum is intimidating and when you turn on this machine you really feel scare, the suction of this vacuum is so strong that you can be in danger if you are the one having the hair cut.  Never use this for cutting a kids hair, maybe for dogs but with the noise of this machine the dog will get very scare.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how pleased I am with this purchase. First a bit of history: the first thing I ever bought on the Internet was the Robocut. It was in 1999. That Robocut lasted until this year (2012). The only thing I ever had to do was replace the blades -- once. Those blades went dull, I think, because I did not oil the blades for the first few years that I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How much have I saved over those years? Well, I&#x27;m male, but I have long hair. If I wanted my hair with any kind of decent cut it costs at least 25 bucks, although it was not unusual for me to spend 40 bucks. So let&#x27;s say 25 bucks. So for 14 years, I saved $75 per year (3 haircuts at 25 bucks per cut x 14 years &#x3D; $75x14&#x3D;$1050) for a total of $1050. I remember paying about 80 bucks for the Robocut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why was I willing to do it? Because I find the whole hair-cutting experience to be pretty awful. You go in, let some stranger play with your hair, you often have to wait a long time pretending to read magazines, and I always walked out thinking \\&quot;I can&#x27;t wait to this grows out, because right now it sucks.\\&quot; The fact is with the Robocut I gave myself the same middling haircut since 1999. It wasn&#x27;t a great haircut. If I walked out of a haircut place with that haircut I would&#x27;ve said, \\&quot;OK, that doesn&#x27;t suck too bad. I give it a B.\\&quot; But that&#x27;s about the same grade I would give haircuts average to most people who cut hair professionally. Don&#x27;t get me wrong hair-cutters of the world. I know there are people out there that are artists. I used one of them for a year, and I lost track of him. That&#x27;s the problem... you find somebody who&#x27;s good, then you lose them for whatever reason (you move, they move, whatever) and then you&#x27;re stuck flailing for a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why do I like this version with the vacuum attached? The old version had a problem: it was all or none. I may have had a sucky vacuum, but as the blades were going around I had to put the vacuum pretty close to my head. Thiswould suck all the hair in, so all that hair would get cut. But the vacuum on the vacuum version of the Robocut is pretty darn strong. So what I was able to do was keep it two or 3 inches away from the hair and that would lift just one layer of hair, which I could then cut. So I&#x27;m able to layer. Which is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other aspects of this Haircut Pro Vacuum to like as well. The whole apparatus is much less cumbersome than dragging out my vacuum. There is this swell little notch where you can put the cutting wand onto the machine while you futz with mirrors and scissors and whatnot. It may seem like a small thing but it really makes a huge difference.</li>
    <li> We love the Robocut, my husband was in the military and we have four sons, haircuts were a \\&quot;huge\\&quot; expense for us. This did the job for all of them, and myself as well. We love the robo cut. I have read the other reviews, that it \\&quot;pulls\\&quot; hair. You do need to do maintenace on your unit. Keep it cleaned and oiled. We have been using the robot cut for 10 years and this is our second unit. When we wear this one out, we will purchase our third unit. This unit is only 3 years old so have many years to go before that happens. Customer service for the unit is fantastic, Alfred is awesome. We cannot recommend it enough!</li>
    <li> I started doing my own hair cuts with a Flowbee in 1993; switched to RoboCut in 1997 and haven&#x27;t looked back.  I love it!  I don&#x27;t have to go get a haricut or make an appointment.  RoboCut is easy to use and easy to have a consistent haircut.  I went from haircuts once a month at the barber to twice a month at my home.  The pay back in savings for the cost of the RoboCut  comes fast. I started with the unit that used my vacuum sweeper, but I bought the model with its own vacuum in 2011.  The only barber haircut I&#x27;ve had since 1993 is when I was waiting on my RoboCut in 2011.  I have the neckline guide, which is great, and I periodically replace the blades.  Its March 2014, and I&#x27;m still very satisfied with RoboCut.</li>
    <li> I HAVE OWN A ROBOCUT FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND MY SON HAS ONE. NOW I PURCHASED A ROBOCUT PRO. I REALY LIKE IT AND IT WORKS VERY WELL. SO SIMPLE TO USE AND SO COMPACT. THANK YOU ROBOCUT FOR MAKING THIS PRODUCT AVAILABLE AND AT A RESONABLE PRICE. A.C. IN ALBQ NM</li>
    <li> I bought my first Robocut in August 2006.  This is my 2nd and it&#x27;s better than the first one I had.  Smaller &amp; more powerful than the previous. Every bit as easy to use as the previous one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t publicize the fact that I use a Robocut, but as a man with a full head of hair, I always laugh when people compliment me about my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So clearly Robocut is doing something right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually on my way up to cut my hair right now...</li>
    <li> I got this because I was tired of getting out my vacuum cleaner every time I used the old model that required a separate vacuum cleaner. The new length adjuster tubes work better than the old ones and it seems to cut a little better making it easier to get a good haircut.&lt;br /&gt;I took away one star because the vacuum cleaner is VERY noisy .</li>
    <li> This is a keeper.  Has already paid for itself after 3 uses.  A little noisy but well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Robocut Automatic in 2009 which is an earlier version of the Pro model.  I love it and will definitely buy another if mine ever breaks or wears out.  I&#x27;m a middle aged professional male with thick, medium-plus length hair with the ears trimmed out (4-3/8ths inches long on top). Thanks to Robocut, I give myself haircuts easily with the help of a couple hands-free mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to get $40 haircuts about every 3-4 weeks from some of the better stylists in nice salons but was not always satisfied with the result. I always had to remind them of what I liked &amp; didn&#x27;t like and also what problems I was having even though I was their steady customer. By paying closer attention to my haircut as it was taking place, after a short while, I felt I could cut my own hair as good as they were. It wasn&#x27;t long before I took the plunge and bought a Robocut. Now I cut my hair without hassle exactly when it&#x27;s convenient for me and I haven&#x27;t spent a dime since 2009. To go along with the Robocut, I also own a good pair of hair scissors and a nimble electric trimmer/clippers for the neckline &amp; ears. With these 3 pieces of equipment and a little self-taught understanding of hair cutting technique, it wasn&#x27;t long before my haircuts began looking really good and consistent. I save a solid $500 every year in expense and a bunch of quality time...I cut my hair at some of the weirdest times of day when nothing is going on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one knows what you want better than you nor does anybody care about how you look more than you! Cutting hair isn&#x27;t rocket science. If you pay attention and write simple notes from each haircut, you will quickly progress and learn how long your hair should be because of thickness, weight, head shape, etc. I take pride in my haircuts and my style looks as good or better than ever before.  I spend far less time, I can get trims or full cuts whenever my hair becomes difficult to manage and best of all, I decide when &amp; where for free!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got the pro haircutter.I&#x27;m in wheelchair an it is soo difficult to get in their chair. I cut my hair a little @a time. This is the greatest. Since,it vacuums the hair I don&#x27;t have hair all over. By the way I&#x27;m 82yrs. PV.</li>
    <li> I have had a flow bee for over a decade - the same one - with no problems. I figured it would soon break so I should have a backup in case I was only half way done with a hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one of these pro&#x27;s as a back up - tried it once - and was very pleased with the cut. Did not have to drag the vacuum around and it is marginally quieter than the flow bee. Well I decided to make the pro number one - but hallway through my next haircut it began to stutter on/off. Had to finish with the flowbee. And my 30 days was up with amazon - by about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon offered a replacement for 20% - which is why I like amazon - and they gave me the number for the manufacturer to see if he could fix it. Expecting the worst I called - and the guy who answered is either the owner or one of the engineers. He seemed to be intrigued as he led me through several troubleshooting techniques - and while puzzled he believed the cause may be a couple of chips in the head. He said he would FedEx a new one - he did - and it worked perfectly. Total cost to me - $20 - to return the original UPS. Thanks everyone for being so reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assume correctly - if you do not see any updates here - the pro is still number one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;140216: a year later and still happy with this purchase. Quick convient and keeps my thick curly hair looking trimmed and ready for work.</li>
    <li> Yes, it cuts your hair. That&#x27;s the only good thing I can say. The design is horrible. It&#x27;s bulky, awkward to carry and use, it&#x27;s loud and VERY difficult to clean. I will say that the quality of cut is slightly better than the flowbee. Less frizzing. It is also very slow to cut. Takes twice as long as the flowbee. I like the quality of the cut but it&#x27;s such a pain to use that I do regret the purchase.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous to use the Vacuum Haircutter, but it was actually very easy and I was able to give myself the best haircut I have had in years.  This product is amazing.  I will never have to go to a salon again for a hair cut.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I am a long term happy customer. I have been using the Robocut model Pro R37 since 2007 and I absolutely love it!  I used to go to salons, spend too much money, then come home and not be thrilled with the cut.  Now, there&#x27;s no hassle and it&#x27;s quick and perfect every time.  Another great benefit is that their customer service is fantastic.  On the rare occasion that I need them, I always get to talk to a real person and they know how to help me. My husband and I both depend on our Robo and my neighbor even comes over now to get her hair cut with it.  Thanks, Robocut, for a top notch product and superior service.</li>
    <li> I trimmed the hair of my 2 small dogs with great results.  Love the blade is stronger than the previous model I have.</li>
    <li> I just received my third Robo Cut. The first one was the beige model that you hooked up to your own vacuum that I used for several years. Last fall I ordered a Pro model for \\&quot;home in Arizona\\&quot;. This spring I bought another Pro model for \\&quot;home in Colorado\\&quot; after the vacuum that I used with my old beige model decided to die.&lt;br /&gt;The pro model requires less messing around with as it is self contained. All cut my sort 3/4\\&quot; minus hair just dandy. In all of the years of use they have never had a problem just be sure to oil the blades every use.&lt;br /&gt;There are just a few minor problems. The decals don&#x27;t like to stick to the plastic vacuum body and a tool must be used to remove the bottom hair clippings compartment.&lt;br /&gt;Robo Cut number 1 I think I bought from Robo Cut, number 2 from Amazon and 3 from Robo Cut..</li>
    <li> I just received my Haircut Pro. I gave myself, and a few of my nephews hair cuts with it. It&#x27;s definitely worth buying. This is my first vacuum hair cutting system, and after looking at the alternatives online, I decided to give this one a try. I&#x27;m glad I did not waste money on any of the other systems, this one is awesome. The only thing is that you need a trimmer/scissors for around the ears and hairline, and the system can be a bit noisy, but it gets the major areas and gives a much cleaner hair cut, so the good qualities far outweigh those two minor cons.</li>
    <li> Since I have very fine hair, which I wear very short, I have a difficult time getting a good haircut.  And Since I am going RVing, I was trying this to see if I could cut my own hair and not worry about getting a good haircut when I am on the road.  It works beautifully.  Even the first time out, I did a good job cutting my own hair.  I have now used it 4 times and really like it.</li>
    <li> Makes cutting my hair a much cleaner affair.  The included guides are perfect for me in size and I&#x27;ve never had one slip off (4 hair cuts). It is a bit bulky, so expect it to take a good amount of counter space or just keep it under the sink like we do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;ll dock a star for is the stiffness of the cleaning tray.  It may just be mine, but the tray is really tough to get open for cleaning.  I either pinch my finger if I don&#x27;t pull hard enough or I spill hair if I pull too much.  I&#x27;ve gotten better at removing it with the right amount of force, but an improvement in design would be appreciated.</li>
    <li> I have cut my hair and highlighted my own hair for years.  Started using the Flowbee but graduated to the Robocut, which was much better.  Only problem was having to drag my vacuum out each time.  This Pro Robo has a self-contained vacuum and is fantastic!!  I received it today and used it today-great, great cut - do not hesitate in purchasing the product!!</li>
    <li> I have used it about 4 times now and it is easy to use and works fine. There is a plug associated with the cord that won&#x27;t stay in position, but even with that missing it still works fine.</li>
    <li> After years of hearing about vacuum hair cutters, I finally decided to get one.  I got the old red handled one years ago and it was a battle every time, because the only vacuum we have is a canister with a permanently attached 5&#x27; tube.  I always cut my hair in a small half bathroom, so it was like a comedy movie every time, trying to manipulate the tube, vacuum hose and the red handle (w/ hose).  Scratches on the wall, some choice words and expressions from me.  It was always a battle.  The red handle finally broke when I tried to juggle it and the tube to cut my hair, so I went to the Robocut web site to look for a replacement.  The first thing I saw was the PRO model.  I read the specs and user reviews and thought \\&quot;This is what I wanted all along!!\\&quot;  It turned out to be one of the best purchases I ever made.  I put the unit on the sink counter, plug it in and 10 minutes later I have the perfect (for me) haircut.  I go 4-6 weeks between haircuts, so I always start out with an extender and the angled attachments.  After shortening the length of my hair a bit, I take off the extender and finish up with the permanently attached extender.  What makes this product so useful is that you don&#x27;t have to hold it in the conventional way, by the grip.  The extender(s) are sturdy enough that I often hold the cutter by the extender to get a good, even cut at the back of my head.  I know it&#x27;s a worn out phrase that this product will pay for itself, but within a short time, you&#x27;ll be noticing the money still in your wallet that would have gone to the barber.  Definitely money well spent.</li>
    <li> The pedestal that contains the vacuum motor is extremely noisy, nearly as big and heavy as a small vac, and has tiny-capacity, hard-to-remove, hair disposal tray. I have an older model that comes with a real vacuum instead of this monstrosity, and it&#x27;s much better.</li>
    <li> Some time ago when I got tired of breaking up my busy corporate day with a trip to the &#x27;barber shop&#x27;, I bought a RoboCut with the &#x27;hope&#x27; that it&#x27;d work for me.&lt;br /&gt;Not only did it work, it worked great!&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been to a barber/stylist in years!&lt;br /&gt;This &#x27;tool&#x27; is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;To be &#x27;safe&#x27;, I started off with more attachments than I needed so my hair was a bit longer and I &#x27;shortened&#x27; it from then on as I got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use and handle.&lt;br /&gt;The customer service is stellar.&lt;br /&gt;And, oh yeah, the money I save is certainly a plus.&lt;br /&gt;A BIG plus!&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;d recommend this for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a &#x27;shot&#x27; because you really can&#x27;t lose: just read the warranty.&lt;br /&gt;Buy one, you&#x27;ll be pleased.&lt;br /&gt;dlc</li>
    <li> Absolutely pays for itself in the first couple of haircuts!  Only downfall is that it is loud and may be scary for kids in the beginning.</li>
    <li> I own an earlier verison, model-RC3, more popularly known as the Red model. So, I can&#x27;t specifically comment on the newest blue model version of Robocut. But, as far as I can see, all Robocut cutting heads are the same.  The only difference I can see is the canister or vacuum system used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the RC3 so I could give my 88-year-old father haircuts in the comfort of his own home.  The RC3, like the blue model comes with it&#x27;s own vacuum system.  I didn&#x27;t want to rely on a home vacuum cleaner,  I wanted the entire unit and the RC3 comes with both the cutting head and vacuum canister.  It&#x27;s very portable.  I leave it in the original box and just pull it out when I get to dad&#x27;s house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did I buy a Robocut?  Well, taking dad to the barber each month became a hassle.  It required appointments, waiting for the barber to finish up the customer already in the chair, navigating icy parking lots and driveways during the winter months, etc.  A lot of the things involving mobility that we take for granted are obstacles for an elderly gentleman using a walker.  So, the Robocut (and giving him haircuts at home)was a really welcome addition to caring for my father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robocut gives a wonderful haircut! I&#x27;m not a barber and was able to figure out how to cut dad&#x27;s hair in less than ten minutes. It&#x27;s become easier with each haircut. Now, it takes about five minutes to cut his hair.  And folks are commenting on how nice his haircuts look. They ask who his barber is. When he tells them it&#x27;s me using the Robocut, they are amazed! And yes, people say that they&#x27;d like me to give them a haircut.:)  I&#x27;ve also given my brother a couple of Robocut haircuts. He&#x27;s quite please with them.  When he&#x27;s in town (and needs to save a few bucks), I know I&#x27;ll be cutting his hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robocut is neat and clean. All the clippings get sucked into the canister.  No mess and no clippings to clean up.  Dad sits in a chair, I put a towel around his neck, pull out the Robocut, oil the blades, and start cutting.  If I need to trim here and there, I use a battery powered trimmer (I&#x27;m gonna get some electric clippers)and suck up this hair using the Robocut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later, and the Robocut has paid for itself.  The barber charged 16 bucks per haircut, so it adds up.  One year later, that&#x27;s $192.00 in dad&#x27;s pocket.  Best of all, I don&#x27;t need to schedule an appointment or worry about inclimate weather anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Robocut!the Robocut, oil the blades, and start cutting.

    <li> One of my worst purchases.</li>
    <li> I have a family of 4 and 3 dogs. I have been using the RoboCut for years. I love it. This new model is small, portable, durable and strong. I have been using the Pro Model for almost a year, before that the model that hooks to the vacuum. The whole family gets haircuts even the dogs. I make sure to wash the dogs twice and use the grooming adapter. RoboCut works great! The Pro Model Robocut has paid for itself already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t changed the blades on this new machine yet. But I am not worried they are easy to change, no screws. I changed them in my old RoboCut a couple of times. It&#x27;s easy just pop out the cartridge and pop in a new one. Even my husband can do it if he is cutting his own hair and the blade needs changing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I estimate with 4 to 7 haircuts every 5 weeks for 20+ years I have saved over $35,000. That is enough money to buy a new car or college for 1 year for my daughter. I love it. My hair always looks done and I have saved so much money. Way to go![[ASIN:B005ZAYQYG Haircut Pro Vacuum Haircutter, Blue]]</li>
    <li> CUT MY HAIR TWICE SO FAR AND IT CAME OUT NICE BOTH TIMES ... HOWEVER, I HAVE A FEELING THAT IF YOU HAVE TIGHT CURLY HAIR, IT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM ...</li>
    <li> As a Robocut user of more than 10 years who has saved $1,000&#x27;s on haircuts and 100&#x27;s of hours going to a hairdresser, I highly recommend this product. I upgraded to the PRO Model six months ago and use it every two weeks. It&#x27;s a compact unit and the motor is more powerful than the previous model so it takes less time to cut my hair, no more than 15 minutes. Strangers often stop me to compliment my hair and I&#x27;m delighted to share my \\&quot;secret\\&quot;. The company is very responsive and stands behind the quality of their products.</li>
    <li> I have owned the original robcut since about 2002.  I am still using it.  Saves LOTS of time and Money. Great product and company! Would not want to be without it!</li>
    <li> It worked really nice - but I still need help trimming the edges. There was more power than expected from this little powerhouse vac.</li>
    <li> Good alternative for longer hair and the cutting blade is runs at a much slower speed than expected but works well (doesn&#x27;t jam) and is more durable than Walmart clippers. The suction is great for viewing the hair before you actually cut/trim it. On the downside... it&#x27;s way too loud for my dog (louder than a cheap hair-dryer or vacuum cleaner).</li>
    <li> DAMM good suction even for short and stiff hair like mine,&lt;br /&gt;The extentions are perfect for the length i want,&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need a vaccum cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;No hairs flying all over the place,&lt;br /&gt;is quick and easy no risk of mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;ve givin it five stars but i found that cleaning that filter was a bit difficult.</li>
    <li> I have done 17 hair cuts since I purchased this.&lt;br /&gt;I have saved 70.00 on hair cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone wants one. Everyone loves my hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I like it! I think it takes a while to get use to it. I like the results I&#x27;m getting.</li>
    <li> I have been a Barber for 52 years. I have been using a robocut  for about 25 years. I am ask by my patrons who cuts your hair, because I work alone I tell them I cut it myself, but I don&#x27;t tell them how because I want to stay in business. this is the best way to cut your hair. If everyone tried this all Barbers would be out of business. I have told some of my older people when it&#x27;s hard for them to get to the shop about the cuter and it is a blessing for them. So get you one and no more hair down the back. And put the $16.00 dollars in our pocket!!</li>
    <li> After paying $55.00 for one of our Shih Tzus to get groomed we decided to look into this haircut vacuum. It worked quite well. We gave it quite a work out the first time we used it and it was worth every penny. We put the one inch guard on and away we went. They were cut eventually all over, unlike going to the groomers where our dog came out choppy all over. The only con is that we had to stop periodically to clean the filter, maybe it wasn&#x27;t meant to cut dog hair, but that was not a big deal to us. I highly recommend this for four legged and two legged...:)</li>
    <li> It was a little slow and methodical  at first but it did a good job. It&#x27;s me , and like golf, I can only get better with mistakes. The mistakes did not show with Blue as they did on my score card. Frank</li>
    <li> This is our second Robocutter and we think they&#x27;re great. They have saved us hundreds and hundreds of dollars in trips to the barbershop and hours of time. I will say however the new model here has some good and bad points compared to the old version.&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;1. it&#x27;s smaller and lighter&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s a bit quieter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;1. The power cord is way too short. The old model used to have a retractable power cord like a regular vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;2. There&#x27;s no handle.&lt;br /&gt;3. The suction setting is cheaper. The older version used to have a knob that controlled suction by lowering the power of the motor. The new model allows you to control suction by twisting the hose to either open or close off a hole. They both work...the original was just a bit more elegant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter, if you want to do quick, inexpensive haircuts...these are great and they do a fantastic job.</li>
    <li> While this is pricy, I&#x27;ve found it to be the best system for at home hair cutting.  Just get a pair of ear plugs, as this sucker is loud.</li>
    <li> My wife asked for this last Christmas, She has a short spiky style. Works Great. and we are able to keep my little boy;s mop under control. I tigure it has paid for itself twice over in the last year,  The only thing I would recommend is to order a few extra filters.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t paid for a haircut in 8 years. At, say $20 per haircut, once every 4 weeks, that comes out to a savings of around $2k so far.&lt;br /&gt;The RoboCut is pretty easy to use, even on yourself. I was a little worried at first about doing the back of my head, but I don&#x27;t really need to see it, I can do it by feel at this point. I think the result you get is more precise than scissors, a more uniform length (or bevel).&lt;br /&gt;The only problems I have had with it are:&lt;br /&gt;- the clear plastic sleeve that you set the length with is kind of slippery on mine (but it is 8 years old) so I keep my pinky finger on it so it won&#x27;t move.&lt;br /&gt;- the hose eventually cracked (after like 4 years), and I had to cut it off and stuff the newly trimmed end back up into the unit (I had the version where you use your own vac) a few times. I think they should just forego the hose and just have a place to plug in your own hose. That&#x27;s what I ended up doing, I just cut off the end of the hose with the fitting and glued it into the housing, works well with my shop vac.&lt;br /&gt;- my first unit&#x27;s gearbox died after about 4 years, but that&#x27;s still pretty good if you consider the price and resulting savings&lt;br /&gt;- my second unit&#x27;s housing cracked, but only because I dropped it on the bathroom floor&lt;br /&gt;And customer service has been excellent when I called for parts.&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars if it were made of tougher plastic, but then it would probably cost more. Overall it is a cost effective solution and I am pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> We have made many purchases through amazon, but we are extremely unhappy with this product and would like to re turn it. Please help us!</li>
    <li> Very inconvenient design. Tried to use it and it stopped working after 10 min. Returned it (thanks Amazon return policy!) and bought a simple traditional clipper.</li>
    <li> When I told my wife, my mom, my son, etc. that I ordered this, they were all naysayers. They all said it was ridiculous and what not. But after reading all the positive reviews, I knew I&#x27;d prove them wrong and I did! This product worked great! I gave myself a haircut and it is cut exactly the way I like it. It was simple, quick and actually kind of fun. All you need to do after the vacuum part of the cut is some fine-tuning with a decent pair of styling shears and a beard trimmer or clippers. The attachments that come with this product are interchangeable to cut your hair down to any length, from 6&amp;#34; long all the way down to a buzz cut. I am very enthused about this product and would recomend it to anyone who is picky about the way the get thier hair cut and can&#x27;t find a decent barber or stylist. This one will cut it the same every time. I will also be able to cut my 2 sons&#x27; hair with this! The reason everyone wants to rip on this product is because of those old cheesy Flowbee infomercials from the 80s and 90s and because it sounds strange to anyone who has never heard of it to use a vacuum to cut hair, but after they saw what a good job I could do by myself in just a few minutes, they were pleasantly surprised! If you want to be able to cut your own hair, or cut your family&#x27;s hair and save a lot of money on hit-or-miss haircuts at barbershops and salons, this is the product you need. It can do a lot of different kinds of styles ( I do the layered cut, but there are a whole slew of other possibilities and lengths you can do with the attachments, etc) and does a good job. In conclusion, a fine product!</li>
    <li> I purchased the RoboCut system about 25 years ago! I have always cut my own hair so the RoboCut was perfect for me! Easy to use and allows me to cut my hair exactly even throughout! I am a believer and a loyal customer!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Robocut Pro for about six months to give my dogs haircuts.  It has saved me hundreds of dollars.  It is easy to use and does a great job.  I have a Schnoodle and a Labradoodle and they seem to enjoy it.  They are not freightened by the sound and my wife says they look terrific.  I&#x27;m not a groomer but they look as good when they&#x27;re finished.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to save a bundle on groomers. I haven&#x27;t tried it on myself but that&#x27;s next.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT HAIRCUTS FROM THIS MONEY SAVING DEVICE. I&#x27;VE USED IT FOR OVER FOUR YEARS WITH NO COMPLAINT OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT MY BUDDIES TEASE ME ABOUT CUTTING MY OWN HAIR AND BEARD. DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB - QUICKLY. IT TAPERS MY HAIR AMAZINGLY WELL AND SAVES ME OVER $20.00 FOR MY HAIRCUTS AND BEARD TRIMS. VERY EASY TO USE IF I NEED JUST A QUICK TOUCHUP BEFORE TAKING MY WIFE OUT. MY ROBOCUT MORE THAN PAID FOR ITSELF THE FIRST YEAR. BUY ONE YOU WON&#x27;T BE SORRY - YOU&#x27;LL BE SURPRIZED AT THE EASE OF USE.</li>
    <li> I have used Robocut for over 20 years.  Not only do I get a perfect cut every time, the economy of this process is terrific.  I was spending $20 per month on haircuts...since switching to Robocut, i have saved almost $5,000 staying out of the barber shop..Not only that, you get the SAME great haircut each time...At the barber shop, some cuts were great, some not so much..With Robocut, your hair is cut perfectly every time...The service at haircut.com is exceptional...These are good, honest people with a great product..you will not regret owning and using a Robocut..</li>
    <li> I bought the Flowbee a long time ago and then upgraded in 2007 to the Robocut.  I have not had to pay for a haircut for myself and my family in about a decade.  I just recently upgraded to the Robocut Model PRO.  It is fantastic and comes with it&#x27;s own built in vacuum.  I have to say that all of the products I have purchased have been excellent and very worth the investment.  I highly recommend anyone that doesn&#x27;t want to waste their money at a hair salon but wants a decent haircut to get this product.</li>
    <li> I HAVE A SMALL DOG, IT SEEMED TO DO OKAY BUT THE FILTER GETS FULL AND CLOGGED UP QUICKLY. I HAD TO CLEAN IT OUT 3 TIMES TO CUT THE HAIR ON MY 7 POUND PEKINGESE</li>
    <li> Love my Robocut. Been using previous Robocut models for over 20 years. Saved thousands of dollars over salon cuts, &amp; I get a better haircut by avoiding the miscommunications w/ the stylist. I cut my hair to look exactly as I want it. Plus, no salon appointment making, no waiting w/ magazines in the salon, no gas spent driving to the salon, no recurring costs to pay the salon, no tipping the stylist... I cut my own hair anytime @ home for free. Hurrah! I&#x27;m free, thanks to Robocut. And I have dense hair, lots of it, &amp; I like it longer. For me, the trick is to keep the Robocut device moving, w/ very small, quick, back &amp; forth movements, @ all times while moving it across my hair. Its quick &amp; easy to set different hair lengths, so I do that in 3 zones to get that professional \\&quot;feathered\\&quot;, or \\&quot;layered\\&quot; look, which lays well. Robocut comes w/ oil to keep the blades sharp. It&#x27;s easy to apply. No disassembly required. Robocut has easily paid for itself many, many times over. I love it. John.</li>
    <li> I bought this to give my dog a haircut. After just the second time of use the motor got really hot and a oily substance started coming out around the on switch. I was hoping to return it but the return date has expired. It works really good but my concern is that it will get too hot and cause a fire.</li>
    <li> I been using Robocut since 1987 and every time one breaks (this is my 4th one, and will break every 8 or 9 years)&lt;br /&gt;I have to go to a barber mostly to cry because I can not get exactly the hair cut that I like and get all the time with&lt;br /&gt;Robocut.Once you get to know the machine and learn how to use it, very simple I might add, cutting your hair is so eazy&lt;br /&gt;I cut myself and 3 members of my family and still last a long time, never mentioning how much money We save on barber shops&lt;br /&gt;Like to give 10 stars because really this product perform as it suppose to and of course will buy another one when this new&lt;br /&gt;machine breaks lot of years in the future</li>
    <li> Let me start saying that I have thin hair and not so many.  I usually cut my own hair, kind of a buzz cut with a hair trimmer, the problem was all the mess with the hair left everywhere afterwards.  That&#x27;s why I bought the Robocut Pro blue model.  Well I had trouble cutting my hair by my own, specially in the back.  Used the adapter for the buzz cut and it was somewhat intimidating, I was afraid i might get hurt because of the suction.  But then setting it to low I felt it did not do a better job.  Also sometimes I felt my hair was being pulled, even though i oiled the blades and all.  Anyways I did not like the experience, maybe its not for me sending it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I liked was there was no hair mess as this product sucks all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways if you are going for a buzz cut its probably better to stick to a hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> Now that I mastered how to cut my hair with this unit, I can say that is difficult to find a barber able to do a better hair cut for me. This is a very noisy hair cutter. Its vacuum although very effective is way too loud. Also, it is flimsy and somewhat fiddly. However, I give it five stars for the precision, quality, easiness, and consistent reproduction of a good hair cut. This Vacuum Hair Cutter, may be not for every one, it takes some experience to get the skills for near perfect reproduction of quality hair cut. My granddaughter is a beautician and professional hair stylist, but after seeing my hair cuts she decided to let me cut her hair. She liked it. She is coming back for more. We both are saving money ( I do not charge her).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and just love it! It cuts evenly and there is no cleanup required. I&#x27;ve saved hundreds of dollars on haircuts at the beauty salon and have better results using the Haircut Pro Haircutter. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchase the Haircut pro to replace my RoboCut which I have had for some years. As it was coming from the USA to the United Kingdom  I had believed it would be the correct voltage,  but to purchase a  transformer to convert it from 240v to 110v  with the correct amperage here in the UK would be more expensive than the Haircut Pro. And the with  return charge of £58  looks that I am stuck with it,</li>
    <li> I have a handicapped son. He cannot hold his head up by himself. It worked so well that I dont know why they dont have it advertised on other sites for physically challenged people. I wish I would of had this 15 Years ago. Would of saved me a whole lot of time and clean up. The vaccuum feature is AWESOME!!!! No more hair in the eyes, ears, and mouth. THANK YOU Haircut PRO.</li>
    <li> It pulls my hair.  I feel it was a waste of money</li>
    <li> I used the red Robo cutter for several years, and finally got tired of dragging out my portable vacuum to hook things up, so I decided to move up a step to the Pro model. I especially wanted to try the stronger motor. I received it in the mail yesterday, and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. Keep in mind I have used the red Robo cutter for several years now. I immediately could tell a difference with the Pro model. I have very thick hair, and the Pro model zipped through my hair so quickly and efficiently that I almost cried. I just \\&quot;thought\\&quot; I was getting a good cut with the red cutter. I \\&quot;know\\&quot; I&#x27;m getting a good cut with the Pro model, and it is a joy to use. What a treat to cut your hair in 5 minutes with the extra strong motor, and no hassle having to wrap up the portable vacuum and put it away. It has become a one step process, with fantastic results. I highly recommend the Pro model, and would never go back to anything less.</li>
    <li> Cuts ok, but have to make multiple passes with our Maltese.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have no hair cutting experience and now I can cut my hair by myself and it looks every as good, if not better, than my regular beautician. I can be as picky as I want and cut it exactly to my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This item works fine but since they&#x27;ve revised the shape of it, it&#x27;s more awkward to work with and move around.  Also the &amp;#34;filter&amp;#34; that you have to empty the hair out of is much harder to remove and clean.  Honestly it&#x27;s made much more cheaply than the previous version and doubt it will last as long.  Whoever thought these &amp;#34;changes&amp;#34; were an improvement needs to go back and look at the older version.</li>
    <li> Really looked forward to getting this. I usually buy Flowbee&#x27;s but decided to do different this time.&lt;br /&gt;It is really rinkydink plastic. It was hard to open bottom to check filter.&lt;br /&gt;But it works and is way loud. (Use earplugs) To be fair the flowbee vacuum is also very loud. Flowbee&lt;br /&gt;was not as rinkydink.&lt;br /&gt;But it does work. Cut my hair to a 6 inch length. So I will keep it.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT FAST SHIPPING</li>
    <li> PARTY-TIME !! EXCELLENT !!  THIS hair cutting machine sounded like a JOKE from Wayne&#x27;s WORLD or some bizarre dream where you get trapped in a situation that seems almost miraculous to extricate yourself from!!! Yes! MY DOG was the reason I bought this machine because her hair was almost 6&amp;#34; long all over her body except that she is a black lab!! !! The black hairs started shedding all over the hard-wood flooring AND I could only imagine the layers that were darkening the shade of my carpet.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I started cutting with this nifty contraption all over her body; back and forth, up and down doing passes over the longest spots first and slowly I started seeing lines of her body emerge from where a large black hill of hair had just stood!! Voila!! A MIRACLE!! The only close trimming needed was an ear trim and nail trim and she is PERFECT!! THANKS Robo! It was fun, too!!!</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hair for quite some time now.  I have tried Flowbee and Airpro, Robocut system is by far the best. It&#x27;s the fastest and gives the best cut. Customer service is true customer service,the way it should be. I could not be happier with this product and I&#x27;m sure you will be also.&lt;br /&gt;Dave</li>
    <li> ...... . . . . . . . . .  ...  JUST A GOOD SOLID PRODUCT, THAT DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT SAID IT WOULD</li>
    <li> A bit loud. Longer hose might be better. Trims with multiple passes at the length selected by the trim guide. Watch for loose skin folds if guide selector is set on the shortest cut. The suction will get skin next to the mesh covering the cutter blades. Skin won&#x27;t get cut, but the shock of it can make the user a bit leery.</li>
    <li> This does a pretty good job. Quick touch up and no mess thanks to the powerful built in vacuum. However, if you buy it here from Amazon you pay more than the $99 you can get it from elsewhere. Also, you get the hairline accessory not included in this version from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions that come with it are just for cutting you hair. You&#x27;ll have to figure out how to empty the thing. I can&#x27;t find instruction on how to do this anywhere!</li>
    <li> cut my hair all one length. machine works great for what i need it for. iwould recommend itfor simple cuts ;but don;;t knowabout more complicated ones</li>
    <li> This was a gift and he was very pleased.  It was exactly what he hoped for.</li>
    <li> Got my haircut over the weekend with this device and got lots of compliments at work!  I first set it at 6 inches but it still looked too long so I set it at 4 inches and that looked a lot nicer on me.  No one could tell I cut it myself, let alone using any kind of machinery!  I have naturally wavy hair and use some pomade on the tips and get an instant Betty Boop hairstyle!  Word of caution - oil the blades EVERY TIME right before use.  I didn&#x27;t do that the second time and my hair got caught in the blades!  But overall I&#x27;m very happy with the experience and am looking forward to many more pretty home haircuts.</li>
    <li> The product &amp; the company that makes this product will exceed your greatest expectations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to everyone at Haircut.com company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough said!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris M.</li>
    <li> Love it, super easy to use.  Pulls your hair a little when cutting though and is quite noisy.  Other than that I like it far better than the previous Flowbees Ive had.</li>
    <li> Worked great for the first haircut. Sliced my hand open on the plastic tabs when I first opened the vacuum to see how much hair was actually cut 😞 blood everywhere...  Then went to use it a second time a few weeks later and the vacuum was working but the cutting blades wouldn&#x27;t work, wouldn&#x27;t spin to cut the hair. Very disappointed overall.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that I do not have to clean up hair all over the place when I trim my hair.  ...But I will say I am disappointed in the quality of construction. There is a small wire connector  that is very flimsy.  I have my doubts about its durability. The hair collector tray is very difficult to open which can result in a clean up when it finally pops open.&lt;br /&gt;I aso would recommend that you do not use the highest suction in order to have more control.&lt;br /&gt;Also, doing the tapering in the back of your head by yourself with the included tool would take a contortionist.</li>
    <li> The only problem I have with this machine is that it doesn&#x27;t cut evenly on curly hair.  There are pieces of long hair left among the others.  Also, it is very difficult to get the bottom open to clean out the cut hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Robocut Haircutters for over 20 years; in fact, I haven&#x27;t been to a barber since I got my first one back in 1989.  My wife cuts my hair with it; we both love it because it&#x27;s quick, does a nice job, and leaves no mess to clean up.  It&#x27;s not that I can&#x27;t afford to go to a barber...I&#x27;m the founder of a successful company with worldwide recognition. The convenience of doing it at home, often times last minute before an important meeting or trip, is wonderful.  We also cut our kid&#x27;s hair with it, and have saved a bundle over the years. The Robocut is one of those rare products that easily pays for itself many times over, both in dollars and convenience.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love it! Saved about $40 already.</li>
    <li> We have purchased several Robocuts over the years and get compliments on our haircuts all the time.  It has saved us hundreds of dollars not to mention hours of time.  There is nothing better than wishing you could get a little trim and voilá it&#x27;s done.  So very convenient.  Problems have been few but when there has been a problem or a question, they are right there on the phone and helpful as can be.  To us, Customer Service is what it&#x27;s all about and Robocut exceeds expectations.</li>
    <li> Well i just gave myself the first cut, and I gotta admit it works pretty good. Ok, i am no edward scissor hands thats for sure....in fact i dont have a hair cutting clue! So if i can pull off a passable cut without any help/supervision....well anyone can.&lt;br /&gt;I must say, that i was reluctant to try it, as frankly the instructions just did not leave me feeling confident.&lt;br /&gt;And as far as that goes....i think a demonstrational dvd is in order....as actually seeing others use it would do a much better job of conveying proper technique &amp; would leave no questions unanswered.&lt;br /&gt;Despite my trepidations.... i put on the angled adapter on &amp; had at it....basicly \\&quot;combing\\&quot; my hair slowly &amp; carefully until it looked shorter....simple as that.&lt;br /&gt;No, it does not look great......BUT....it does not look bad &amp; i am confident i will get better at it, and i love not having to go through the barber shop ordeal as lately it has been a real hassle.&lt;br /&gt;If this had come with a how-to DVD then i likely would have done a better job....so it loses a star for that one,  as ....for 125$ i think it is not an unreasonable expectation. Besides it would likely be cheaper to produce, so why not?&lt;br /&gt;This is the 1st home hair cutting device i have tried....after doing my homework on the subject, it became readily apparent that this was the one to get. I considered a cheaper variant....but realized that i would likely either be unhappy with it, or it would soon become dysfunctional...or both....so why waste money trying to save money?...&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;going for broke\\&quot; &amp; getting the Pro is the actually the most cost effective way to go, as they dont get any better than this.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways... I am happy with my purchase of the Haircutt pro &amp; if you are sitting on the fence on this one....i would recommend to just go for it....as the longer you wait the more money you waste paying the barber ;)</li>
    <li> Got this today and I was overdo for a haircut. I have the old style that needs to be hooked to a vacuum that I have had for years. This thing cut my hair in 5 minutes. Worked fantastic. If it lasts as long as my old one I will be a happy camper. I save more time and money with this I cannot even put it into words.</li>
    <li> I bought the deluxe RoboCut with vacuum cleaner built in almost 15 years ago for my 7 year old son with severe Autism.  Before owning the Robocut/w vacuum  my son&#x27;s hair had to be trimmed while he was in a sound sleep. My son because of his disability and his super sensitivity did not allow anyone to cut his hair as he did not like  the sight of his cut hair falling or the feel of his cut hair falling on him. The Robocut vacuum was and still is the perfect answer to our prayers as my son&#x27;s cut hair is sucked into the vacuum cleaner while it is being trimmed. The no clean up for me after a hair trim is an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;Today my son is almost 22 years old and has never had his hair trimmed by a barber he will only have it trimmed by our robocut which we take with us where ever we travel.&lt;br /&gt;Our son now has a Labradoodle service dog. Like his master the service dog will not allow a groomer to trim his hair.  However one day after watching his master get his hair trimmed with our Robocut the dog promptly jumped up to the chair my son left when his hair cut was finished to get his hair trimmed next without any problem getting him to stay still and with professional looking results.&lt;br /&gt;Now both enjoy their Robocut which still works perfect after nearly 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;We just needed new attachments which the manufacturer was kind enough to send new replacements free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Robocut!!  I honestly don&#x27;t know what we would ever do without you!!</li>
