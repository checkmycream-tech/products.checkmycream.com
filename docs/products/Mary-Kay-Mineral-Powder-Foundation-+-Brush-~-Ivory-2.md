<li> It&#x27;s not like 20 bristles fall out randomly all over your face after each powder...</li>
<li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with this powder foundation.</li>

    <li> I really like the Mary Kay products and this is no exception.  Easy to apply and provides a light coverage.  Love it!</li>
    <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with this powder foundation. Great coverage and the container last a good while. I&#x27;ve worn this for many years.</li>
    <li> These powder foundations are my favorite.  This Mary Kay foundation is well designed.  They blend very well.  It&#x27;s long lasting as well and is lightweight.</li>
    <li> Great product. Received earlier than originally specified.</li>
    <li> I paid extra because this was supposed to come with the brush, but didn&#x27;t. It was a gift and I didn&#x27;t have time to return to Amazon for a replacement.  I would suggest saving yourself the hassle and pay less from another seller who doesn&#x27;t promise to ship a brush with the foundation then doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> The foundation is perfect for me because it is not oily and it does not clog pores.  The powder has a nice finish just like a liquid foundation would have without the heaviness and oily skin.  I&#x27;m impressed with this product.  You only need a little bit to cover the entire face.</li>
    <li> I gave 4 star because my brush is shedding everytime I use it. Other than that I am satisfied with the order.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with my purchases, excellent customer service. Products are great! I encourage small business and I recommend to everyone who uses MK. And others who&#x27;d like to try!</li>
    <li> shipping was a little slow, but product is great.</li>
    <li> I love Mary Kay. I have been using there powder foundation for about two years now. I love it. Really quick to use, cubes my under eye circles caused by my two kids under two and covers up my tween like pimples when I have them. I work say however that the brush is a waste. The bristles are constantly falling out all over my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE USED PRODUCT BEFORE SO FOR NOW ITS FINE</li>
    <li> Same product I have gotten from Mary Kay reps but cheaper.  Only difference I have noticed is the lid seems as if it might have been made with a flaw, but it does not effect the product or its ability to close.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting one of the larger mineral powder brushes thought I&#x27;d had a year before, but it was a medium size brush. Maybe I&#x27;m crazy and my old one was medium as well but I still got the product I&#x27;d hoped for</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It makes my skin look amazing and it&#x27;s the perfect color. They also send me an applicator brush with it that I wasn&#x27;t expecting so that was a pleasant surprise! It&#x27;s also one of the best applicator brushes I&#x27;ve ever used! The only problem is when you shake it out of the bottom into the lid for application the super light powder sometimes gets everywhere. Overall I love it.</li>
    <li> My order came without the brush. Then once I went to use the powder, I realized it did not have the seal on it like it&#x27;s supposed to have.</li>
    <li> Great price, quick shipment</li>
    <li> Just as posted! Was factory sealed &amp; in correct shade.  I&#x27;ve had these brushes before, and yes, they shed some as other reviews stated.  But you get what you pay for &amp; mine always last at least 1 1/2 yrs.  I&#x27;m no makeup artist or model, so it&#x27;s more than enough quality for me for the value. It&#x27;s not like 20 bristles fall out randomly all over your face after each powder...just pick off the few strays that only occasionally shed &amp; be happy.  Money over vanity here, IMO.  Very happy with purchase, highly recommend &amp; will definitely purchase again!  Super fast on delivery too!</li>
    <li> Great service from buyer. Packaged well and received on time. Awesome service!! Very pleases with the product . All and all had a great experience .</li>
