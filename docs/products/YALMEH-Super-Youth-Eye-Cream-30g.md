<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So far my face is healing from red blotchiness due to allergies from histamine&#x27;s. great.  I am usually sensitive to products to I don&#x27;t order them but this is great</li>
    <li> I do not see results that well, it took a long time to work.</li>
    <li> I have really bad allergies so I get dark circles. I&#x27;ve only been using product for a few weeks and I do see results...it does smell funny though but I would recommend product</li>
    <li> What were people smoking when they wrote this review?  Made no difference for me.</li>
    <li> Awesome product my skin looks great</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this eye cream, the quality ingredients really show through. I could even see a difference the next day with the fine lines around my eyes. I love the way that it makes my skin feel after using it as well, very soft and yet firm. most of all it really helped with my under eye bags. I did receive this product free of charge but the opinion is honest and my own</li>
    <li> This did not work for my dark circles at all</li>
    <li> This got awesome reviews so I was excited to try it.. It is very thick and moisturizising so a little goes a long way. Barely dab and apply. I apply at night and by morning theres a faint residue. A couple of times I have experienced bad eye irritation and redness as I think some seeped into my eyes while asleep or if I rubbed my eyes. Sometimes I am hesitant to use it because of that....</li>
    <li> I really like the creamy,fast absorbing texture of this eye cream.Too early to tell if it is helping with my dark circles.</li>
    <li> No improvement in eye skin and have been using it for a while now. Will not be buying again. Not sure if I will even finish the product before I&#x27;m on to the next eye cream and I still have half the jar left.</li>
    <li> YALMEH offered to send me their Super Youth Eye Cream for free, for review purposes, so I jumped at the chance.The cream almost has a slightly gel like texture.  It absorbs quickly into my skin, without leaving it feeling greasy.  A little bit certainly goes a long way.  I didn&#x27;t see any dramatic difference in my dark circles using the YALMEH cream, but I did like how it moisturized my eye area without irritating my eyes.  My eyelids are VERY sensitive and I often get styes, no matter how diligent I am with washing them.  When using the  Super Youth Eye Cream, I had no issues with any styes or any sort of irritation in the area.</li>
    <li> I have seen NO results for the past couple of months I have been using it.&lt;br /&gt;Giant waste of money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a miracle cream or anything I would tell my friends they &amp;#34;must use&amp;#34;.  I would probably not purchase this again if I could.  The ingredients are awesome and I don&#x27;t have much complaint other than the fact that it wasn&#x27;t a 5 star &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; type product.  If it was like 5 bucks, sure, but 20 plus dollars it better be better than an average lotion which I didn&#x27;t experience.</li>
    <li> Fantastic creme you can feel your skin tighten when you apply the first time. I recommend this product.  Nice light fragrance.</li>
    <li> I am a self proclaimed eye cream junkie, and this is the only one I&#x27;ve bought twice.  Works better than much higher priced brands.  I love that it comes in a jar and I can get every bit out.  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</li>
    <li> This eye cream is fast absorbing - soft and silky to the touch with a very light almost not there scent - it feels great going on the skin and helps with the dark circles and wrinkles around your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a week or so and my eyes are looking brighter and less dark - I look less tired which is good since I am a teacher and it seemed like Christmas break was never going to come.  I like this eye cream and would recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a small container but you only use a small dab so it should last a long time as compared to the size.</li>
    <li> After two weeks of taking Yalmeh super youth eye cream, I noticed my face looking more youthful and healthier. Its really amazing how well this works on my face. I love the fact that its organic, since I hate putting all kinds of chemicals on my face that are from other products I&#x27;ve bought in the past. You can really feel it working and I&#x27;m so happy it does. I don&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it to all my friends - I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. For the price I believe anyone who uses this kind of product should buy it.</li>
    <li> I am still waiting for the result , I will get back with u , with in a few weeks . I just start using this product last week.</li>
    <li> The Yalmeh Super Youth Eye Cream is an awesome eye cream. I love to apply mine right after I get out of my morning shower &amp; right before I start applying my makeup. Its easy to use &amp; helps me look &amp; feel younger with use. Plus the ingredients used is organic &amp; natural which is always an added bonus. On top of that it helps to firm my skin while erasing wrinkles too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month and I do see a great improvement especially that &amp;#34;crow feet&amp;#34; area of the outer eye..  A general firming  the whole eye area.  I have super sensitive skin and it does not irritate.  Only a tiny amount is needed.  Smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I should have been alerted by the insane number of good reviews. I&#x27;ve been using eye creams for years. Miracle cures they are not, but they help moisturizer the eye area. The same cannot be said of this product. Perhaps it reacted badly with my skin or it just wasn&#x27;t for me, but in any case I simply could not use it.&lt;br /&gt;The company however was excellent and gave me no trouble when I returned it.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is very rich, creamy and smooth.  It feels soft and hydrating on my skin.  I use it around my mouth too.  I have a lot of wrinkles there, and not as much around my eyes.  However, I&#x27;m hoping it will help with the dark circles around my eyes--I just haven&#x27;t been using it long enough yet.  One thing I can tell you is that with my dark circles, I use a concealer.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream, my concealer goes on so smoothly and stays there throughout the day.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this eye cream and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Smells great, nice texture, and a nice amount of product for the price.  Works well for moisture and diminishes the look of lines.</li>
    <li> I originally got this cream for dark circles under my eyes. I don&#x27;t really use face creams so it was uncharted territory. I received the unscented cream (a day early, btw) and have been using it for 2 weeks. I have already seen results and the skin on my face feels tighter as well! I&#x27;m very happy and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Are you very skeptical when I bought this I cream, however, I would recommend this product. Yalmeh does what it states. This is a well know eye cream.I suggest anyone to use it</li>
    <li> Love the smell and although I don&#x27;t use every night, I do notice a difference when I do.  I use all over my face and neck.</li>
    <li> Yalmeh Eye Cream with vitamin c and e is very soothing to the eyes. I place a tiny bit under and over the top of my eyelids each night. It has Aloe which is nice and refreshing. Yalmeh&#x27; s super youth eye cream treats and repairs wrinkles, dark circles and reduces the look of age spots and reduces fine lines around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for over a month and I do see a slight difference in the corner of my eyes. Anti aging creams take a long time to show results and you have to use it every day. All natural ingredients free of glutens and fillers GMO (genetically modified organism) free. I received this product complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review and opinion. All opinions and reviews are my own.</li>
    <li> Good cream! Wrinkles around my yes are gone. Will make this cream part of my beauty routine. A must have.</li>
    <li> I find this product very satisfying. I buy many skin care and beauty products and I must say, I immediately noticed the effects of this eye cream. It felt so soothing to my skin and I could really see the fine lines almost go away for me the first week I used it. I&#x27;ve tried other products highly concentrated with peptides and retinol, and they just burned or severely dried out the skin around my eyes. This product feels so natural and good for your skin. The moisture lasts and leaves you feeling supple. I will definitely buy this again. It&#x27;s also scent free and great if you have sensitive skin. Can&#x27;t argue with such a reasonable price either.</li>
    <li> I would like to note that I purchased this item over a year ago and waited to post my review based upon using the Yalmeh eye cream after 6 months of use. I am Asian, mid 20s, and was looking for an eye cream to specifically help with puffiness/bags, dark circles, fine lines, and age prevention. My main concern was the puffiness/bags and dark circles under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the cream only once every night before bed along with my regular skincare routine. I chose not to apply it in the morning since my liquid eyeliner didn&#x27;t apply very well with the cream underneath. After using almost half of this jar, there have been no dramatic differences to my eye area. I don&#x27;t expect a miracle product, but I was hoping for some small signs of change underneath my eyes. The bags/puffiness still appeared under my eyes even after well rested nights. The fine lines are still just as visible as before near the corners of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note that you do get a lot of bang for your buck. Compared to other eye treatment products, you do receive a lot for the price you pay. The texture was nice and silky, almost like a gel moisturizer. I think this would serve well as an eye moisturizer but in my opinion, this does not do what it&#x27;s advertised to do. I&#x27;m sure no miracle eye product exists out there, but this product did not work for me. I continue to use the remainder of the product as a simple night moisturizer for my eyes but I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> After 2 weeks of using this product, I noticed the fine lines around my eyes were reduced, as well as around my mouth. This product is fragrance free, and I have very sensitive skin, and so far it has caused no issues with me. At this moment I am really amazed with this product &amp; will update after a month to see if I continue using Yalmeh Aloe Super Youth Cream.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream! I use it day &amp; night. It lasts awhile &amp; I have ordered it a few times.</li>
    <li> i had dark circles under my eyes always hide my eyes with sunglass i got this cream last week i really Love this Yalmeh cream great product it really works great would recommend this product. i will buy again. awsome</li>
    <li> Creamy and smooth feeling after application even though the cream I received was clumpy. Worked well as a moisturizer but unfortunately did nothing to my wrinkles after using it 2 x a day for 6 months. Disappointed</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It actually fades the wrinkles. I &#x27;m going to use this product again.</li>
    <li> I have been using about a month. It soothes and brightens dark puffy circles.  It is a gentle soothing cream to apply, with no scent which is nice.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of eye cream experience to compare this with but I don&#x27;t go to bed or apply make up in the morning with out applying the Yalmeh eye cream.  I am happy with the results of this cream,  between this and the portion this cream is a steal!  4 instead of 5 stars because I have not noticed a great effect on fine lines.</li>
    <li> I have only had this for a few days, but it feels very nice.  I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m 14 again or anything, but my eyes feel good and I have no problem with any irritation or anything.  It does seem to have made a dent on my puffiness - so I&#x27;m happy. You only need a tiny bit and I think it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!! Bought it for my lady.. Started sneaking a bit before sleep when she raved about it.. No more bags! Bought my own this time. And all you need is a tiny dab. Seriously. Just a dab&#x27;ll do ya</li>
    <li> I have not so bad dark circles, but I do have severe puffy eyes due to sinus and allergy problems. I have been using this product for over 3 1/2 weeks. I cleanse my face as normal then apply a toner, before I moisturize my face I apply this eye cream right on the puffy/dark circle area. I have been doing this routine ever since, and one thing I can tell you is that Ive noticed a slight change with the puffiness. The dark circles I had pretty much fade away. I really don&#x27;t have to apply much concealer as I use too because the puffiness has went down a bit and I can barely tell if there are any dark circles there. I highly recommend this product if you are experiencing puffy eyes or dark circles. Make sure you apply to a clean face....keep up a routine and soon you will begin to see the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION AS WELL!</li>
    <li> Yalmeh Peerless Beauty has done it again! This Aloe Super Eye Cream removes wrinkle and dark lines under my eyes. I love that this product is plant based and has no parabens, mineral oil or harmful chemicals for around my eyes. I goes on smooth and feels great as it works. I saw results in a matter of weeks. I am so glad that I tried this and I will continue to get it and use it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had never needed to use an eye-cream before a certain age, and now that I have found Yalmeh, I doubt I&#x27;ll ever need anything else. It&#x27;s natural and soft, and filled with Aloe, Vitamins C and E, both of which are very important for skin health. I use a light dab during the day, since I also wear makeup, and the dryness and flakiness around my eyes has disappeared. I use a wee bit more at night, in addition to my other creams and unguents, and wake up nice and hydrated. The cream is very hydrating but balanced. I love using it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! My wife loves the eye cream, she finds the texture very natural and not oily.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s happy, I couldn&#x27;t have asked for more...&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
    <li> Have not quite seen the results it claims to produce.  Pleasant smell and easy to apply.  I don&#x27;t think any cream or product is truly going to eradicate or reduce the signs of aging.  You cannot fix &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Good price and it works and I have very sensitive skin and the product was delivered quickily I would recommend this to others</li>
    <li> This is a great under eye product.  Not moistens and it lessens dark circles.  Will definitely buy again.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> not sure i am seeing results but i keep using it feels good around eye area</li>
    <li> This product is the best I have used.  I have very dark circles.  Usually there is no difference after applying a product.  I did have some success with evening primrose oil which, after a time, reduced them by about a third.  With the Yalmeh, I noticed a difference very quickly and I would say it reduced them by half - probably the most one can expect but I haven&#x27;t been using it all that long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only owned this eye cream for 3 weeks, but the seller is giving a 40% off coupon if I leave feedback within a certain time frame, so I&#x27;m doing it. So far, the skin around my eyes feels tighter after I apply the cream. The cream has a light, pleasing texture and an okay scent. However, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the dark circles under my eyes, which are the reason why I purchased this cream. I&#x27;m hoping that I just need to give it some time and consistent use, but who knows. So, I like the cream, but I don&#x27;t love it. If it doesn&#x27;t end up touching the dark circles, I&#x27;ll try something else in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 weeks later, I am editing my review to mention that the seller is no longer offering the 40% off coupon. I still feel like it&#x27;s important for me to mention that they did (at the time I purchased the cream) offer the coupon because I bought this cream partly because there were so many reviews. I don&#x27;t know if they offered similar coupons to others or not, but I think it&#x27;s relevant to those considering purchasing the product. However, the company has now emailed me SEVEN times about my review and I am beginning to regret that I ever gave them my email to get a coupon in the first place. Plus, after another 2 weeks, I still can&#x27;t see a difference in my dark circles and I&#x27;ve noticed that the skin-tightening effect of the cream isn&#x27;t as good as the cream I purchased before this one.</li>
    <li> Great winter moisturizer. Scientific evidence says there&#x27;s no such thing as an anti-ager so I won&#x27;t bother you with false hope, I&#x27;ve seen no real evidence of anti-aging anyway. I&#x27;ve used this for 3 years and I love it. It really makes my skin soft and dewy (not greasy). Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes so you can apply it all over the place. Has a lovely scent. I&#x27;ve used the expensive Oil of Olay for a few years before I found this and comparatively this has less ingredients and moisturizes longer. Oil of Olay felt like it evaporated before it sank into the skin, Yalmeh doesn&#x27;t evaporate and moisturizes all day. At least try it, it&#x27;s definitely affordable.</li>
    <li> I have only had this cream for about a week. It feels great when I put it on, light and creamy. I feel like in the short time I have used it, it has helped with the puffiness I get under my eyes. I purchased this for puffiness, dark circles and some fine lines. I am 33 yrs old and get puffiness and dark circles from allergies. Ive been using the cream at night and in the morning and its really helped with the puffiness I get and the dark circles.  Nothing yet for the fine lines but it hasnt been long enough.  I have very sensitive eyes that water and get irritated with certain things / chemicals etc and this has not bothered my eyes at all. Plus its a great size jar for the price and has lots of natural ingredients which I like. I will update my review after a few months!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a difference and I have been using it for two months. I am African American maybe it doesn&#x27;t work as well on darker skin. The product feels nice on the skin and has a fresh smell.</li>
    <li> I have had dark circles for years…I still have circles but they are NO LONGER DARK…It took a couple of months for the results to show up…I&lt;br /&gt; thought maybe it was my imagination at first, but then my daughter asked me how I got rid of my dark circles…and we have be kind of amazed that they have not come back even on days when I have not had a good nights sleep.  That is quite often I might add.  I still am looking for other reasons why my circles may have become just circles and not dark circles anymore…I did have a  long time troublesome tooth pulled, but aside from that nothing else has changed.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything for my deep dark circles.  I thought I would try this and wha laaa!  This is very moisturizing, soothing and helps with my dark eye circles.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but it&#x27;s been a two week now and I am starting to see results.I like the 50g jar even if you use it every morning and night, this best eye cream will last over a year or even more . Every time I open the jar I feel like I havent even touched yet. I highly recommended for men eye cream.</li>
    <li> I wanted to give it a good while to test it out, but it&#x27;s been over a month and it has had absolutely no effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. It just doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Yalmeh Eye Cream for about 2 months. I haven&#x27;t noticed a change yet, but they say to give it 3 months or more, so maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be giving my review yet. Nice packaging, good amount for the price. It should last me awhile.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to see if the company has an entire face cream that I can also  use for my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have tried too many eye treatments and been disappointed.  But this is the first one that has not disappointed and actually done what they proclaimed to do.  Although it&#x27;s been less than a month, I am already noticing a difference in shadows under my eyes.  The company representative contacted me to find out if I had any questions, which I did (can you use this on your eyelid? -no) and they got back to me immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I rarely write reviews, but I do recommend this eye treatment highly.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is very nice and quickly absorbed.  I use it not just on my eyes but other dry areas as well.  At my age (72) I don&#x27;t expect all wrinkles to vanish :) but it looks better to have them softened.  The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the rather intense smell, which probably cannot be helped.  I use it only at night because of this.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to get rid of puffy under eyes.  I think this is more for other problems.  I did find something called \\&quot;La Cerise\\&quot; that seems to be helping, however, turns out Preparation H works pretty well also.  I use the prep H at night and the expensive stuff in the daytime to make it last longer.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this product and I like it as it seems to work well. It does have a flowery scent, but I like that and once I put it on, under my eyes, I do not keep smelling that smell. I mention this as I read reviews before purchasing and some said they didn&#x27;t like how strong the smell was. But…as I said, once on, I didn&#x27;t keep smelling it. Kind of wish I did, as it is a very nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;So, the product does seem to work and I think I&#x27;ll order more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a month or so and I haven&#x27;t seen any results, only a slight red irritation under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Oh lord! Seriously everyone needs to purchase this product. I&#x27;ve seen a tremendous amount of improvement lately and I highly recommend this product to everyone dealing with dark circles and under-eye wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I love this cream it makes my face super smooth and yes i said face even though is for the eye i tend to apply it all over my face and my face looks amazing the day after, I usually apply it at night and it also works on the eye dark circles, my dark circles have brightened a bit i recommend people to buy this.</li>
    <li> This did not do anything.</li>
    <li> I been using this cream for a month now and I have experienced some small improvements. The puffiness has decreased a little bit. I am going to continue to use it to see if it will really diminish the puffiness over time.</li>
    <li> I have tried other &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; creams...that didn&#x27;t firm...so I was skeptical about the Yalmeh cream.  Since there were and are so many very positive reviews, I did finally order the cream for myself.  And I am so glad that I did.  After only a few applications, I can see a definite tightening of the skin below my eyes.  The cream is thick but is absorbed within minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this eye cream...it&#x27;s terrific!</li>
    <li> Wonderful service. Product was as described and after using it for a few days I am extremely happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This stuff has been great. I&#x27;ve used it for a little over a month, and definitely noticed an improvement to my under-eye area. It has helped lighten the dark circles and keeps the area moisturized and fresh-looking. I&#x27;m about to turn 27, and have been sad to see my under-eye area grow a little &amp;#34;crinkly&amp;#34; when I smile. Using this eye cream makes me feel confident that I can prevent some further aging and keep things hydrated. It is pleasant to use, with a soft and slightly gel-like texture that absorbs pretty quickly. Also, the jar is enormous compared to other eye creams, which makes it an awesome value. Yay for natural skincare!</li>
    <li> I love skincare products! As I get older, I&#x27;ve been paying a lot more attention to what I should &amp; should not be putting on my face. Anything that will help with the fine lines that are appearing around my eyes &amp; the dark circles under my eyes is what I want to try. So I am trying YALMEH Super Youth Eye Cream.&lt;br /&gt;This eye cream is available in two sizes: 15g or 30g. I received the 15g size which is a white tub with a blue label that comes in a pretty blue box . It is intended to reduce fine line, dark circles &amp; wrinkles. It can be used around your eyes as well as on your cheeks &amp; forehead. It contains Organic Aloe Vera, Jojoba Oil, Rosehip Seed Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Green Tea, Vitamin C &amp; Lemongrass as well as other ingredients. These are just a few of my favorites which I love in my skincare products.&lt;br /&gt;This white cream is feels silky soft &amp; has a wonderful subtle scent of aloe. It smells so refreshing &amp; light! The cream absorbs quickly into my skin &amp; does not leave any greasy feeling when I apply it around my eyes. Since I have combination skin, I do not apply this cream to my forehead but I do use it around my eyes twice each day &amp; on my cheeks during the day. I have not experienced any redness or irritation from using this cream. My skin feels soft &amp; smooth after applying the cream but I have not been using it long enough for it to effect my fine lines at a cellular level. I&#x27;ll continue using the cream &amp; as my skin gets smoother I hope to see a lessening of those fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I was not required to write a positive review &amp; the opinions expressed above are 100% my own based on my use of the product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product from last 2 months. It was waste of time and money. Instead of reducing the dark circle it has made my eye more dark. My recommendation is not to buy this product. It will not have even 1% of effect. Stay away</li>
    <li> I love the way this cream goes on and the way it makes my eyes feel and look refreshed.  I am 65 and need a cream that really hydrates the entire eye area.  Such a large jar for the price and seems to really be working as well as creams that I have paid twice the price for.  I would recommend that you try this one. I will certainly purchase this one again.</li>
    <li> I did receive Yalmeh Active Super Youth Eye Cream for my review in exchange for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely in love with this product. I know that it was mentioned it can take up to three months to see results. I did notice results within the month. The results I noticed were the dark circles under my eyes are starting to fade away. The fact that they got lighter thrills me. I also liked that you could use this around your mouth, forehead, and eyes. I have some fine lines by my mouth. I also had a dry spot on my forehead and it smoothed it out. The product is not greasy at all and it absorbs right away. I also like the fact that this is all natural. I also like that you don&#x27;t need a big amount of it for it to work. You just lightly touch the cream and apply it.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it for a long time but I do like the smoothness of application.  Still have to see what it does for bags under the eyes.</li>
    <li> The cream seems nice.  A tiny bit seems to go a long way.  It goes on smoothly and is not shiny or sticky.  I have been using it for about six weeks, and it SEEMS like it&#x27;s helping with my dark circles and puffiness, but I&#x27;m not positive.  I will say that my dark circles were not terrible before, so it&#x27;s not like I would notice a huge difference.  The dark lines I had before are still there, but it does seem like they are a little less prominent.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle cream that changed my skin overnight - I would rather have a cream that takes time and makes a permanent difference.  That is yet to be determined, but I will continue to use it and will try to update!</li>
    <li> It is still too early to tell much but, it seems to work when applied at night before bed time</li>
    <li> This product works really good for me, I have very puffy eyes and it works very well to get rid of the &amp;#34;puffy&amp;#34; eye look.</li>
    <li> This special skin refreshener goes on smoothly and lessens the puffiness and lightens the area.  It&#x27;s a good buy as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this skin cream to anyone who is looking for a wrinkle reducer and smoother looking skin.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results but I will keep using it till it runs out or I see changed.</li>
    <li> Although I have only been using this product for about a week, I am, so far, very pleased with it.  I love the mild fragrance, find it very easy to apply, and have had no adverse reaction whatsoever!  Since I have sensitive skin, that is saying a lot.  It is, of course, too soon to know what kind of difference it will make long-term, but at the very least I expect it to help me avoid further damage to my eye area.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and I have not had an issues with redness, burning, or irritation.  This product has a slight rose scent (reminds me of my grandmother), but it fades quickly once applied.  I have noticed that my concealer sits on the surface more (settling in the creases) with this product, but not enough for me to stop using it.  I really like the feeling of this cream on my eyes and lips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 31 year old African American dark toned woman and I&#x27;m on my 4th deployment in Afghanistan.  I really needed something to help fight this harsh weather (especially during the winter) and long hours.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> When I buy eye creams, I am typically treated to a tiny jar of product.  I have to say that the Yalmeh Super Youth Eye Cream is a nice sized item and is a good value for the price.  Also, their guarantee can not be beaten!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the cream itself to be highly fragrant.  The cream applied very smoothly and felt wonderful.  It&#x27;s a light cream that I&#x27;ve been using around my eyes and also on my upper lip to stop any wrinkles from setting in due to dryness.  I am 48 and am blessed with very nice skin and a youthful complexion.  A product like this helps me stay that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is more than I would have expected for an eye cream.  I am unsure if this would create an allergic response to anyone who might use it who has allergies to perfumes, scents.  I am highly sensitive but this one did not seem to bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of note: I was provided with a sample to test and review.</li>
    <li> I love this cream!  I not only use it for my eyes but my whole face, it is light and absorbs quickly. I use it in the morning under my make up and at night.  I will keep buying it!</li>
    <li> I am not sure if it helps my little wrinkles around my eyes, but this cream is so nice to use on my face and it smells great.  I have very sensitive skin and this does not bother me at all.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have used just about every moisturizer under the sun and none worked until I found Yalmeh.  It is amazing and effective.  At first it was so thick I though it would cause a break out but it did not, it cleared up my dry skin due to allergies in 2 days and even cleared up small patches of eczema on my arms.  This is a above standard face crème!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know if I should order this Eye Cream or not when I ordered the Face Cream for my wife but now I&#x27;m glad I did because she loves both products and keeps commenting about them to me.  That&#x27;s when you know you finally made a good choice of gifts, lol.  Let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s hard for guys to know what women like.  She&#x27;ll like this product.</li>
    <li> What a joke.  I used this product religiously and it did nothing.  Don&#x27;t waste your time and your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks and I&#x27;m already noticing a slight difference in the wrinkles around my eyes. This product didn&#x27;t sting like some I&#x27;ve used which is a big plus. The customer care from Yalmeh compared to that I&#x27;ve received from high end salons and is certainly beyond compare when it comes to online ordering. They actually followed up with email to make sure I received it and then again to see if I had questions. They really care about their customers and stand by their product. I will certainly be a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> I could tell a difference in my skin within a week.  My husband noticed a difference too! I love this product.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for about 3 weeks now and I do see improvement.  I look for simple, effective and reasonably priced skin care products - this will likely make the cut!</li>
    <li> This product has reduced fine lines around my eyes and reduced puffiness.  I&#x27;m happy when I look in the mirror.  I recently went to a concert and saw many friends I had not seen in awhile.  I received so many compliments about how i looked.</li>
    <li> Too much perfume for my taste, and not necessarily the type of scent I like... It kinds of smell like an old lady. I believe that if it goes on your face it should be scent free</li>
    <li> I am 28 but I&#x27;ve got some wrinkles and eye bags due to my allergies. I&#x27;ve tried so many different creams that were just wasting  of money and time. Because of the reviews I decided to use Yalmeh. I have been using it for almost 2 months now!  It reduced my wrinkles and I don&#x27;t have those puffy eyes anymore. I didn&#x27;t expect this result at all. I started seeing the difference after a month. So, give it a time. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. By the way it&#x27;s my first review ever!</li>
    <li> Product was delivered quickly, packaged nicely, and has a very nice texture to it.  I like that the eye cream contains aloe vera, alpha hydroxy acids, and vitamin C.  The company sent a very nice follow up email with detailed directions and are available for you, if you have any questions regarding the product.  This is my first time using the eye cream, so far I am happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this product.  I bought it for dark circles under my eyes. I have used this product twice a day for 90 days and see no difference in my fine wrinkles or dark circles. It does smell nice and feels good on the skin, but didnt do a thing for wrinkles, puffiness or dark circles.</li>
    <li> I have had these dark circles underneath my eyes for a long time. I started using this product just a week ago, and it has shown some positive results.</li>
    <li> I needed some eye cream for my saggy eyes and this cream does the job to alleviate that.  Not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> I am a 55 year old white male who has had a dark circle under one of my eyes for 30 years. This product dramatically lighted that circle and the new one I &amp;#34;grew&amp;#34; about 10 years ago.  I still ain&#x27;t pretty but raccoons no longer call me daddy!</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised. Feels great- smells great.  Already seeing results. Makes my eyes look less tired.  The packaging and case is good looking as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to get rid of my dark eye circles, well I&#x27;m going to hit you with the bad news first, it has not worked for me, and I use this every day, morning and night. Honestly, between my severe allergies I was born with, and probably genetics I don&#x27;t think my eye circles are going anywhere, but thank goodness for concealer! Here&#x27;s the good news, this eye cream has my eyes feeling refreshed and smooth, and when I wake up I don&#x27;t have crusty weird eyes. I cheated on this product when I ran low and got this product on Amazon as well called Gratiae Organics Replenishing Eye, and it turns my eyes red because I think it leaks into it, then my eyes look all weird. Anyways, that product sucks, this product does not. I love the way my eyes feel whenever I put it on. The only issue I have is that the price has been raised significantly, and if that doesn&#x27;t change I will be cheating on this again. On a good note it does last a couple months, so at $30 that&#x27;s right around 50 cents a day which isn&#x27;t bad!</li>
    <li> I got this eye cream because I&#x27;m tired of the dark circles under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Been using it  for about two weeks now and I&#x27;m already seeing results.&lt;br /&gt;And now my wife started using it, cause she saw my results.Good quality product!&lt;br /&gt;The thin skin under my eyes seems to have thickened a little bit. The darkness isn&#x27;t as dark.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this purchase and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I am not a person who is very sensitive to cream smells.  I usually like scented face creams and dont mind them.  However, this face cream has a strong, strange smell to it that is very very difficult to get used to.  I decided not to return the cream and have been using it for about one week.  It feel good on my face (even though some spots feel a bit dry after application and I have to reapply more in certain sections).  But the smell I cant get over... I cant comment on the results, but I can honestly say that the smell will most likely make me stop using this product.  I just want to put this out there for those who are sensitive about fragrances...  I really wanted to like this cream, but after one week of use, I am finding it very difficult to get used to.  Will continue to try since I have so much of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 12/3/13- Yalmeh customer service is absolutely amazing!  Upon reading my review they offered to send a fragrance-free version of their product for me to try.  I thought it was going to be a sample, but to my surprise they sent a full size!  I am trying the product and so far so good.  It feels great in my skin and the smell is not a concern anymore.  Thumbs up for taking care of your customers!  Could not be more satisfied with a company that puts customers concerns first!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am 54 years old and have always had dark circles under my eyes, not small one but very large circles.  I have had to wear concealer all my life, even when I don&#x27;t want to wear makeup.  I have been using Yalmeh Eye Cream for almost a month now and I can see a big difference in my eyes, the darkness has faded a bit and the skin around my eyes feels so much softer and tighter.  It has very little smell to it, kind of a clean shower smell, and it is very easy to apply.  I also have dark areas wear my glasses fit on my upper nose and I have been putting Yalmeh on this area also and I can tell you this really works.  I am a country girl who lives on a ranch so I rarely wear makeup, but with my dark circles I was having to apply concealer even going out to feed the livestock LOL, however now I don&#x27;t have to add as much concealer. I hope they will eventually fade away completely by using Yalmeh Eye Cream.  I apply it after washing my face before bed and when I get up in the morning.  I wait till it is completely blended into my eye area before I apply my moisturizer.  I had acne as a teen and still have a few flair ups even at my age now, and my skin is a bit sensitive to certain items and I am happy to report after a month I have had no problems with breakouts so it is very safe to use on those of us with skin problems.  I highly recommend this product and I will be using it as my normal routine to look beautiful even for my goats and cows!  LOL</li>
    <li> I just started to use this product for 2-3 weeks and feel good about it ,  I think it works .  but need more time to convince on this.&lt;br /&gt;i also like their package.</li>
    <li> Nothing, doesn&#x27;t even make skin feel moisturize. Took a picture of left eye when I received jar. when jar was 1/4 used no improvement in reducing wrinkles or discoloration under eye. Same results after 1/2 jar was used. Now over 3/4 used nothing, nada. Will be requesting my money back.</li>
    <li> I just started using the product and I feel that my face has positively changed. I hope to stick on this for while and see the next step....</li>
    <li> There is a lot of product in this jar. I get put off by expensive eye creams in tiny jars!  It has a light scent that is clean and fresh smelling. The cream is thick, but it absorbs into my skin very well.  My skin feels wonderful after I use this product. I&#x27;m 33 and have some small crows feet, this product hydrates my skin making them much less noticeable. I wear concealer under my eyes everyday and it goes on great on top of this product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since 10/22/13.  I thought I would give it some time before I reviewed it.  I have puffy eyes, circles and wrinkles around my eyes because of years in the sun taking care of and riding horses.  I give this three stars because it does make my skin soft and not so dry feeling but it did nothing for my dark circles, puffy eyes and wrinkles.  Now having said this I realize that my situation is very different from others because of my &#x27;outdoors&#x27; history and this might work well for others but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This is very moisturizing without being greasy or heavy.  When I forget to put it on - I can totally tell the difference.  I am using it under/on my eyes, between my brows and on my forehead.  It has not made me break out at all.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long, but I would say that you can already see a small difference.</li>
    <li> I ordered this eye cream based on the reviews and I am so happy that I did!&lt;br /&gt;It glides on so easily and truly seems to improve my fine lines and&lt;br /&gt;dark circles. I just received my order of their Aloe Vera Face Cream and can&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;wait to try it out. Yalmeh products are turning out to be exactly what I need!</li>
    <li> I use this with the face cream, and love them both.  No greasy film, like a lot of eye products.  Just after a couple of used, my bags and dark circles have lessened.</li>
    <li> It tingles every time I put it on, it makes me feel like it really works.  It has a good aroma to my face too.  I use it all around my face as a moisturizer and not just my eye.</li>
    <li> It is very creamy and I love size of container, time will tell if it makes my eyes look younger</li>
    <li> Smell very good and this cream stopped my dark circles and puffiness. I appreciated all natural ingredients in this cream.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for nice costumer service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with dark circles for ages and I will do almost anything to make them look (and feel) better.&lt;br /&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I was given the opportunity to test Yalmeh Super Youth Eye Cream.  I&#x27;ve used and am fairly impressed with the results.  The cream is gently fragranced.  It goes on a touch thick, but absorbs well. For me, I prefer to use at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;After just a couple of weeks, my eyes are much brighter and fine lines have disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;I received the YALMEH eye cream to facilitate this review. I received no monetary compensation. All opinions are my own and based on my own use of this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months and I love it. I haven&#x27;t noticed a change as far as wrinkles but it has definitely brighten my dark circles around my eyes and cheeks.</li>
    <li> This is a solid eye-cream that I find soothing at both morning and night. It is smooth to apply, has little odor (I don&#x27;t like strong perfumes in any of my lotions or products - except for actual perfume!), and seems to brighten my eyes in the morning. The product&#x27;s packaging advises that we have to wait some weeks to see results. Perhaps. I&#x27;m not necessarily looking for the fountain of youth as much as something that will quench my eyes and help my makeup stay smooth throughout the day, which this does. I am satisfied with the product and the price.</li>
    <li> Received as promised and the product works!  I know it says it takes a few weeks to see the positive affects but I have already noticed what a great product this is!</li>
    <li> I am not really impressed with this eye cream.  So far, it has not lived up to its claims.  I do not expect miracles, but I did hope for more.  I will not purchase this again.  Sorry!</li>
    <li> I realize that topical&#x27;s aren&#x27;t as effective as surgery, but hope springs eternal.  This arrived with instructions and a message telling me that someone would call me in about 30 days after purchase and ask me about any results.  I received the call...told the lady that I saw now change at all.  She asked: .&amp;#34;No change at all?&amp;#34; She then asked if she could call back another time.  I never heard from anyone after that.&lt;br /&gt;There are  recognizable brands available that are cheaper and do work, some.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for exactly one week now and the results are wonderful.  I have dry skin and noticeable wrinkles at the outer edges of my eyes. I also have dark rings that makes me look tired. This cream moisturized the skin around my eyes and smoothed out my wrinkles and the dark rings under my eyes have diminished. This cream have improved the overall appearance of my eyes and I&#x27;m very pleased with the result in just one week. I also love the wonderful fragrance in this cream. It smells like I&#x27;m in a flower garden.</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive skin, Yalmeh Eye Cream is a excellent eye cream that I  can use as a night and day cream.</li>
    <li> My mother and I have been using this product and it really feels nice.  I feel like it plumps my under eye area (at the time of application).  I&#x27;ve only been applying it at night because it seems a little thick to be used underneath my concealer (my personal opinion).</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive and this did not perform well for me</li>
    <li> I began using Yalmeh about 1-1/2 months ago and was pleasantly surprised. Upon awakening, I have &amp;#34;eyebags&amp;#34;. I have used several products that were okay, but I was still looking for something better. I think I&#x27;ve found it in this product. There is virtually no smell, it goes on light with no greasy residue, and the bags are not as pronounced as they once were. I still awaken with the bags because of allergies, sinus, etc., but after applying it my eyes really start to look the way I like them to look...reduced baggage.</li>
    <li> Great eye cream! It is very light weight and non greasy but still moisturizing. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great Results, fast too ! Good enough that I bought another, and shared with a friend. Def. recd. this product</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping that it would help my bags lessen but it didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a good moisturizer for the face but is not specifically for your eyebags or dark circles.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I expected more results but have not seen much of a difference.  I was hoping for more. My eyes still look puffy and dark.</li>
    <li> I love this. I bought it as an eye cream, it does moisturize, but I&#x27;ve found it best as a full face cream. It has really helped brighten and plump up my newly sagging neck and upper chest skin. Also I&#x27;m using on my forehead and seeing a difference. Not quite sold on the eye cream use, I&#x27;ve found better creams for that area but I&#x27;ll continue to purchase for these other areas. Package is generous size and it&#x27;s in my budget. That&#x27;s worth 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is a good eye cream if you are looking for something that is not too greasy.  It feels nice on my skin and my make up wears beautifully over this cream.</li>
    <li> Loving this product. It&#x27;s rich and creamy and my skin soaks it up. Softer appearance around my eyes!! Highly recommended! !</li>
    <li> Love that cream cuz it&#x27;s light, absorbing well but so far I didn&#x27;t see much difference on skin. I gave only 4 stars but I think need more time to see result</li>
    <li> I used this cream for a few days under my eye and then I notice it made my dark circle worst. It also made it more wrinkly and almost look like I havent slept for days!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive eyes and a lot of creams make them water. But this one doesnt. It feels good and absorbs nicely.</li>
    <li> Best face cream in the world it works I just love it so much it&#x27;s a much have face product.</li>
    <li> love it! excellent product</li>
    <li> I love this cream. Is very good, it take time to see results but I am very happy with it. Thanks</li>
    <li> As a beauty addict, I tried a ton of eye creams in the past, always looking for THE ONE. Well, my search is over. This is the perfect eye cream, it feels very smooth and you can wear it night and day. Fine lines are gone, dark circles are gone. My eyes look so much better since I started using this product. Price is fantastic too. You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you try it.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a week, but I really like it, so far!! It feels great going on.</li>
    <li> The container is different, mine was a cheap, light weight plastic container, is it how it suppose to be?........ and it doesn&#x27;t wow me. it was an okay product. maybe I don&#x27;t have too much for it to correct.. it smells okay, yeah, it smells like cream to me, like... I don&#x27;t know if it counts a scent but yeah, it smells like cream to me which wasn&#x27;t so pleasant. I am a little disappointed from the container maybe?  PS: a little goes a long way, I think a small jar can last some time.    ADD: After half year of use (I use it every single day and night), this product helped nothing with my problem. my dark circle is still there and my slight wrinkles wasn&#x27;t gone for a bit. Since it is pretty rich, I sometimes have break outs ( I put it on my face sometime) but isn&#x27;t it already an eye cream? why cant it put on to my face? after I stopped using this product and switch to an other eyecream, my eyes look brighter instantly and friends would compliment my skin.  After the staff from this brand commented on my review, I confirm that the jar should be a heavy duty acrylic container but mine is a light weighted plastic container, that&#x27;s weird.</li>
    <li> As many others have stated I don&#x27;t write many reviews. I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product at first but continued to use it. I did start to see a reduction in the darkness under my eyes but my skin seemed tight. Then I received an e-mail from the sender of the product urging me to review and stating that I needed to be sure to continue to use my regular moisturizer after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading that I tried as suggested and was amazed at the difference. While the under eye darkness had receded, my facial skin took on a much smoother texture and feel to it - where I used the product. I use it only in specific areas. It&#x27;s not a moisturizer. I&#x27;m satisfied enough that I going to purchase the larger container of the product and try it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one that likes to see fast results. This product really does improve the look of wrinkles  around the eyes and neck area. I got a huge jar at a great price</li>
    <li> I used this every day/night.  Did not see any improvements.  The claims probably work better on a 30 something not a 50 year old.</li>
    <li> I am over 50 and have used many different eye creams/treatments at many price points.  This eye treatment is definitely the best I have used.  It is a treatment but it comes in a cream form so it isn&#x27;t drying.  After a few weeks of use I saw a marked decrease in the crows feet around my eyes.  I have also used the cream on deeper wrinkles on my forehead and also around my upper lip with great results.  The price point of this product is also amazing!</li>
    <li> I bought it because I was looking for something that would help not only dark under eye circles but hopefully reduce some of the hyper pigmentation I have from acne scars - hoping for a two for the price of one product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a month now and I can just now start to see a difference in my face.  My under eye circles aren&#x27;t as dark and some of my acne scars don&#x27;t seem as dark.  It&#x27;s no overnight miracle, the way one reviewer would like you to think, but it does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of five stars I give it three, due to the amount of time it takes to work, and the amount of change that you actually see.  But I do think for the amount you get and the price that it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.  I have not been paid or compensated in any way for this review.</li>
    <li> Shipped very quickly.  Large jar and the cream is very soft and creamy, plus it has a very light fragrance.  It keeps my eye area moisturized without being heavy. Easy to apply eye makeup over the cream without waiting.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream! It is a great moisturizer for the skin around my eyes (and everywhere else on my face). It has a great consistency and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> It has worked well, but I don&#x27;t think is the best in the world. But for the price you pay I think is worth.</li>
    <li> I do not do many reviews, this time I said I must to let women know this is a great cream.  I have had many creams high price and low price. This is the best I ever used. Am 65  with dry skin at times. When I use this cream all over my face . It is soft even the next day. I love it and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Hi, this is Terry&#x27;s wife.  I&#x27;m the one who ordered the eye cream.  This product works well as a moisturizer.  It didn&#x27;t cause any itching or burning around my eyes and it helped eliminate the tiny flecks of dry skin I get in my eyebrows.  I&#x27;ve used it several months now and I do think the dark circles under my eyes are fading.  It smells of jasmine, which I notice most of the day.  It&#x27;s almost as if I&#x27;m wearing perfume.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference within a few weeks of using this cream. The skin around my eyes looks brighter  and the overall effect is a healthier appearance. I like the soft, non greasy feel and light scent.  It has become a part of my daily regimen &amp; I have recommended it to friends &amp; family.</li>
    <li> very good but not as i expected</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd purchase of this eye cream! I have tried other brands for eye cream- Relastin, Skin Cueticals, Olay, MD formulations and many others but, seriously this is the one I am most satisfied with.  It absorbs quickly, non-greasy and helps reduce wrinkles around eyes. Also it is easy to use under your foundation or powder base. In addition, it reduces those dark circles around your eyes. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. This is my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; eye cream. Thanks Jacklin for the best eye cream ever! My only wish is if you could make individual travel packets. Thank you for this product.</li>
    <li> This cream is very thick and feels luxurious. I love the way it makes my skin feel. I have been using it almost 4 weeks now. The main reson I decided to try it was to get rid of dark circles. I am only giving it 4 stars because I&#x27;m not sure if my dark circles are lighter. However, I do think it has helped the lines under my eyes. I love the way my skin feels after using it.  It made the skin under my eyes so much softer and smoother than the rest of my face that I now use it on my entire face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very nice cream, but did nothing about the puffiness under my eyes. That, I guess would take a miracle in a jar! Fine lines don&#x27;t really bother me, but the puffiness makes me look chronically tired. Nothing I have tried yet has addressed this problem!</li>
    <li> This review is from: SUPER SALE THIS WEEKEND ONLY, YALMEH Super Youth Eye Cream , Eye Cream For Wrinkles| Dark Circle Treatments | Eye Cream | Best Eye Cream| Natural Eye Cream|Anti Aging Skin Care | Anti Aging Eye Cream | Eye Firming Cream |Men &amp;Women Eye Cream| | Age Eye Cream |100% Money Back Guarantee! (Misc.)&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t start thinking about my skin and aging until I moved out to the desert. When I did, I started trying various products, many which were flukes and others that only moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I choose Yalmeh&#x27;s Super Youth Eye Cream for the supposed natural ingredients that aren&#x27;t supposed to make you break out--i.e., less chemicals. For the price, which hurt, you do get A Lot. It came quickly but was poorly packaged and came to me damaged but salvageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since mid-Janurary of this year, I&#x27;ve been using it solely, day and night under a SPF moisturizer. It&#x27;s white, very rich and luxurious in texture but thick and greasy. I have to spend a little extra time to dab it under and around my eyes as it doesn&#x27;t absorb right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3+ months, I have seen ZERO results when it comes to my eyes. I had read that many use this as an all over the face and I did that...until I broke out like mad ALL OVER. I thought maybe it was something else so I kept it strictly on my eyes and around my mouth and most of the acne disappeared, so I tried again, and once again, a major breakout. I still do get occasional breakouts in the areas I use the product. I had to stop using it. None of the claims are legit. In fact, it made the skin around my eyes WORSE. I&#x27;ve since thrown it away and good riddance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the claim of being a &#x27;miracle&#x27; eye cream, I didn&#x27;t expect miracles, I just wanted something a little better than the stuff I&#x27;d been using. It was a waste of money and I&#x27;d give it zero stars if I could, exactly what it did for me. When I realized it was a complete sham of a product, I went back to read the &#x27;glowing&#x27; reviews to see if I&#x27;d missed something about the product that others before me experienced. I don&#x27;t understand the 5 star reviews!!! The troll that patrols this page will give an automatic &#x27;unhelpful&#x27; click if you post a negative review, just like other 1-3 star reviews, which makes me wonder how many of the &#x27;reviews&#x27; are actually by real customers and not fake. One reviewer (Jason from Denver--posted on June 5, 2014) I found was harassed by the company and they kept calling him to re-do his review and give their product a better rating--wtf!?!? My negative review prompted an immediate response and the rep states they didn&#x27;t claim it was a miracle product on their site when they did in fact claim so but have since removed it. Blah. Blah. BLAH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT&#x27;S A COMPLETE B-U-S-T!!! I WILL NEVER BUY A PRODUCT FROM THIS COMPANY EVER AGAIN!!!I&#x27;d missed something about the product that others before me experienced. I don&#x27;t understand the 5 star reviews!!!

    <li> I ordered for my mom and she uses it every night. after two weeks she tell me that it works very well!</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product for a week now and so far I don&#x27;t see any results but I do like the way it feels on my skin. I wouldn&#x27;t mind just putting it on my entire face if it came in a bigger container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yalmeh has great customer service too. I got an email shortly after my product arrived with some tips on how to use it and get the most out of the product which is nice.</li>
    <li> I waited 6 months to give a fair review. After 6 months of use, I have yet to see any results. I purchased this cream for dark under eye circles and it appears that the discoloration have worsened. I purchased this cream after reading so many rave reviews of how some saw immediate results, but I can&#x27;t honestly say the same.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using this cream long enough to see a difference. You get a big jar of it though. If you use it just for the eye area it will last forever. I&#x27;ve been putting on my whole face. Creamy. Smell is not bad.</li>
    <li> So far good product . I have been using as a night cream and also in the mornings and has visibly reduced my wrinkle to some point, mostly around my eyes and my forehead. Overall I m satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I have only just received this product and from reading the instructions I know that it can take up to three months to see results. This is NOT a moisturizer but certainly feels like one! I can check back in a while to give more detailed review.</li>
    <li> I first bought the small size of this product to try in case I did not see any results, which is the case with most beauty creams and lotions. I love this product and definitely see less wrinkles around my eyes (or, more accurately, none)! I had some deeper wrinkles at the area between my eyebrows from scrunching all the time, and started applying this to the area to see amazing results in the disappearance of those, too! So, I just purchased the larger size and love it.</li>
    <li> This cream does not work. The only reason why there is so much good reviews is because they give you a discount if you write one. I have been using this cream twice a day for three months and I had no improvement at all. It actually made the skin around my eyes scaly. Waist of money. I now use it has a makeup remover.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and so far so good. I love the smell and the creamy texture. The skin around my eyes feels wonderfully hydrated. And, I was surprised by how much product I received for a great price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom as a Christmas present. Since Christmas she has been telling me how well it is working. It is getting rid of her dark circles and on other dark spots. I would recommend this and have considered buying it for myself!</li>
    <li> I am a 50 year old man, and consider quite alethic but was exposed to sun damage  when I was younger without using any sun screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I tried the product for my visible eye bags, which make me look tired and non-alert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product in the morning then at night before bed, around my eyes per instruction. After about 5-7 days, I could notice the puffiness has become much less obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think with continuous use and common sense skin care, I will look more energetic and alert, not like someone who lacks the sleep.</li>
    <li> Using this eye cream feels so great.  I never used any eye cream before so I cannot do some comparison.  But this eye cream does  works for me, I&#x27;m on a graveyard shift so normally I&#x27;m having this eye bags and the coloration under my eyes were not normal so after the shift before going to bed I apply this eye cream and when I wake up my eyes look fresh and relax.  It is back to normal.  This eye cream also reduces the lines in the side of my eyes. I highly recommend this eye cream specially to those people who stays awake during sleeping hours for work.  It helps a lot to relax and freshen the eyes. The scent is so relaxing too.</li>
    <li> You only need a dab! It goes a long way. I have used it for about  a week twice a day. It feels and smells great. I think I am beginning to see my fine lines tighten up. I am looking forward to future results! Great American made product! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Gave me a radiant look.</li>
    <li> Very nice hydrating cream, I don&#x27;t know if it really does anything for wrinkles or under eyes but it definitely feels good on my face and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any change in the (not so fine) lines by my eyes, but the thin dark skin below my eyes is not repaired, but much better.  I have spent much more on creams that had little or no effect</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a week but so far I like the product. I can&#x27;t say if it does all of it claims to yet, but it has great moisture and does reduce puffiness in the morning. After a week: See my updated comment - I began to notice a burn and rash around my eyes even though I wore sunglasses and hat in the sun. I am discontinuing use of this product.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it is going to fulfill all of its promise but so far I love it.  Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product I have bin using this  last one month &amp; I noticed my dark circles is very very light even my co_worker noticed, I just love this product and I highly recommend..</li>
    <li> I have not tried so many products for eye care, but I&#x27;ve had very good results in just weeks!! I totally recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I have had dark undereye circles since I was a teenager -- they&#x27;re hereditary. After about a week and a half of using this cream, they have lessened significantly. A co-worker of mine commented that I looked more well-rested than she had ever seen me. The jar is a generous size and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy, which is my main issue with other eye creams I have tried. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to a friend, though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite the miracle some other reviews make it out to be.</li>
    <li> No difference in my skin in any way. I thought it might work because I have never used a product with a name like this but I saw no change.</li>
    <li> This is a very large size of eye cream.  It&#x27;s probably as good as other eye creams, but I haven&#x27;t had long to try it.  It would be great if it could help the dark circles, but I really doubt they will.  I think my allergies cause those but I&#x27;m hoping.  Only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I prefer makeup and creams in tubes for sanitary purposes.</li>
    <li> I recently starting using Yalmeh eye cream.  I was contacted immediately by Yalmeh giving me great tips on using there product and letting me know they were there for me if I had any questions.  I am really excited to see my results in a few weeks!  I&#x27;ll let you know the outcome!</li>
    <li> have used it regularly for awhile and have noticed no difference -- not even a slight difference. undereye area does not feel soft or smooth.</li>
    <li> I am a self diagnosed beauty junkie. I started taking care of my skin when I was in my late 20s (I am 39 now) and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products. I rarely write reviews unless I am very excited about something or very disappointed. Let me just say if I didn&#x27;t already have a job doing what I love to do, I would sell this product line. I have only been using it for a few weeks and I love it. I can already see a difference in my skin&#x27;s texture. I am excited that it&#x27;s mostly aloe vera - which I believe is one of the most hydrating and healing medicinal plants available. But the most amazing part is the price, especially on Amazon. It&#x27;s lightly scented and the consistency of it is sooo lovely - the feeling is cooling. I promise I am not getting paid for writing this. :) I would pay twice the price for this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t do review much here, but here is my story. I have fine lines, but my main problem is dark circles because the eye area around my skin is quite thin. People think I party too much or don&#x27;t get enough sleep, but it&#x27;s hereditary. Until the last month that I met my college friend, and she gave me one Free Yalmeh Eye Cream jar to test and see if it helps my situation, and here I&#x27;m after three weeks of using it&#x27;s just like a miracle, I can see it&#x27;s been working and reduces the dark circles. I think I&#x27;m sold on this cream. I just bought my new jar today</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what they say it does!</li>
    <li> used it twice a day for a month, seen no visible results on my eye area.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this, and I like the results. It&#x27;s thick but absorbs quickly, making area around the eyes feel smoother. No irritation at all. With continued use, I&#x27;ll decide whether or not it&#x27;s diminishing fine lines.</li>
    <li> I received the eye cream promptly and in good condition. It is a generous amount and quality product. I have only been using it for about a week but my skin feels very smooth and slightly reduced amount of darkness under eyes. It said it generally takes 3 months to see results so I can give an updated review after more time. That is the only reason I did not give five stars. Great value and customer service. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have tried several eye creams over the years (from drug store to department store) often spending about $100 for a decent eye cream which in the end did nothing for my dark circles and puffiness. Recently I developed fine lines and bags so I gave Yalmeh a try (based on the reviews). Yalmeh is the first cream that actually improved my dark circles and reduced the puffiness, and the best part is that the results happened within 7-10 days of starting the product! I&#x27;ve actually had a few people comment on the improvement and ask what product I&#x27;m using. Definitely ordering more and cannot believe it&#x27;s so affordable!</li>
    <li> I have used Yalmeh Aloe Vera Face Moisturizer and I am very satisfied with the result. I have tried a lot of moisturizers of different brands but nothing has worked since if they are not greasy, they caused break-out on the face leaving blemishes. With Yalmeh moisturizer, I see the difference on my face day by day, from being too dry to smooth and oil-free, I can&#x27;t wait to try Yalmeh Aloe Super Youth Eye Cream.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  It hydrates well and is a pleasure to use.  The skin around my eyes is soft and the lines less visible.  It works well on its own and under make up.  Truly a quality product.</li>
    <li> I was out of town when the product arrived so I haven&#x27;t used it yet.  However, it has a nice feel to it.  I will post another review a few weeks from now.  The company sent me an email offering very clear directions on use as well as a couple tips on the product. Since I have not used it as of this morning it&#x27;s the reason for the 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I got this eye cream for my wife. We were asked to review the cream in a few week after purchase but she decided to wait for few months before providing any review. She has been using it for about 4 months and she feels that the wrinkles around her eyes have improved since starting using this cream. She has not had any allergic reaction to the cream so far. Overall she is happy with this eye cream and plan to buy it again.</li>
    <li> I received the Yalmeh Aloe Super Youth Eye Cream for my early birthday gift and was very pleasantly surprised.  I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician and make up artist so I&#x27;ve tried many products. This one did not disappoint.  I noticed results immediately and love the texture of the cream. This is such a great value-finally a product that works and is affordable!! What a concept!  In addition, Jacklin Yalmeh, is very committed to excellence and demonstrates that in her follow up email after you purchase her product. She is available to answer any questions you have about her products.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used many eye creams before and never get results.  You will get results almost instantly.  Will never try another!</li>
    <li> I believe caring for my skin is important and that use of special products for eyes, face, hands and/or body works best. I was provided an opportunity to review the Yalmeh eye cream and have used it for nearly three weeks – morning and evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some days when I stay at home, I don’t apply makeup. I do, however, still stick to my skin care regime of cleansing and moisturizing. Those days, I tend to even apply eye cream and moisturizer or serum mid-day as well as morning and evening. Sort of a “spa” day for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Days when I use makeup, I have found that the Yalmeh eye cream works well under the makeup with no streaking, flaking, or other problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have allergies and the Yalmeh did not irritate my allergy sensitive eyes. It was, to put it simply, a comfort to use during this eye-stressed time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt the Yalmeh cream performed well as a moisturizer providing the care my skin needed around the eyes. I have dark circles around my eyes and these were made worse following heart surgery. It is hard to say for certain, but I do believe there has been slight and gradual lightening of these dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is that a good moisturizer protects and improves or maintains the condition of the skin on which it is used. The Yalmeh Eye Cream has worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review. Opinions expressed are solely mine. I was not compensated to review the product.</li>
    <li> sufficient amount; very good</li>
    <li> Just ok, didn&#x27;t like the smell and didn&#x27;t like how it felt on my skin. I used it for a month went back to Neutrogena products.</li>
    <li> I am a flight attendant and the air in the plane is super dry.... this has caused the skin around my eyes to be very dry!! I have been using this product for over a month now and it really seems to work. The only problem is that it is not improving my skin overall, it just improves it while its on. After I wash my face my eyes are really dry again. I will continue to use this until I find something better... Also, I have no problem putting my makeup on after applying the eye cream.</li>
    <li> About to order another one.</li>
    <li> Light weight and perpetrates quickly. The price is very reasonable; I will be using this product for a long time.</li>
    <li> Yes I have received the Yalmeh under eye cream 3 days ago. It is absolutely  wonderful! In your last email you stated that it could take anywhere from 3 to 4 weeks and even up to 3 to 4 months for full results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But have seen  a marked change in three  or 4 days! I am really 68 years old, but thanks to my health regimen and your eye  cream, I don&#x27;t think I look a day  over 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See attachment below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrea Dana Stevens Alig</li>
    <li> Reasonable price with effective result; I love it. This item is on my regular purchasing list :D! Give it a try, but be patient and realistic- this isn&#x27;t a magic eye cream that can &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34; your eyes within a day or two. /winky winky</li>
    <li> Great product!  You really can see a brightening &amp; smooth look to my face. I love the non greasy feeling, but yet so softening to your skin. I will continue to use daily.</li>
    <li> This purchase was the first time that I received a follow-up e-mail from the seller. They wanted to ensure that I had received this product without issue and to explain the proper use and application of the cream. I have begun regular use of this product and hope that it works well for me as I believe that it is a superior product. I will seriously consider purchasing from this seller again.</li>
    <li> smells amazing too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;doubt it will actually fix my dark bags, but it makes me feel good at least!</li>
    <li> Overall was quite good, more moist, only want to absorb is better is to need to spend more time gently</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product, this product works great.  After a couple weeks of normal use I could notice a big difference with the circles under my eyes, it was less puffy and the dark circles seem to be lightened.</li>
    <li> For years I have always had dark circles and lines under my eyes. I started using Yalmeh super youth eye cream a while ago and the results are coming through. If you have the same problem you should give this a try.</li>
    <li> first of, let me say oh my gawd! I just tried this last night and I can not believe&lt;br /&gt;the phenomenal change / effect of this cream.  I ordered this in amazon couple&lt;br /&gt;of days ago. I was just typing in search box for, best eye cream...this came up...I was&lt;br /&gt;skeptical at first being, the name itself is a little weird to me but, then I read the review&lt;br /&gt;and told myself why not give it a try for I have even tried a lot of eye creams out there&lt;br /&gt;that so expensive and yet always end up disappointed. I tried a lot of brand name eye creams&lt;br /&gt;pharmacy brands etc..name it and always end up going back to oil of olay regenerist serum&lt;br /&gt;which by the way is my moisturizer just to hyrdrate my eyes but, really doesn&#x27;t do much it just moisturize it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now, I tried this last night and was skeptical about it, being I have a very sensitive eyes and sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;always waters down to any product  so, I finally said let me just get it over&lt;br /&gt;with and see so, I dab under my eyes,around the sides of crows and under my eyebrows and to top it up- just to do a trial I also, put some on top hands...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I woke up late this morning for some reason my hand rubs above my other hand and I was like&lt;br /&gt;wow! why is my hand so friggin smooth &amp; soft? then, I remember putting that cream so, went to the&lt;br /&gt;bath room mirror to see and OH MY! the dark under my eyes that, I have for years, have&lt;br /&gt;lightened and brightened for some reason the crease wrinkle under my eye that, was starting&lt;br /&gt;to bother me - is not so dented today.I have never seen a result like that overnight.&lt;br /&gt;It was crazy! I tried looking at other mirrors to see. I could not believe how the effect overnight change, the dark circle was almost 70-80% lightened. I was so happy that, I wanted to buy another&lt;br /&gt;jar just to make sure that this product doesn&#x27;t run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t normally do comments but, I got to give credit to Yalmeh and maybe help others who&lt;br /&gt;have beenin my shoes; sensitive, dark circle and under eye wrinkle, looking tired and have&lt;br /&gt;tried a lot of products. Imagine, I just used this last night, I can not wait to see the effect in 1 week&lt;br /&gt;or a month wow! I was blown away!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Yalmeh&#x27;s eye cream every day for a week now, and I am pleased with the results.  First of all, this eye cream smells so good!  It has a nice, clean, floral scent that I love.  It&#x27;s very easy to apply.  I put it on every night before bed.  You don&#x27;t need to apply much, so I think this bottle will last me a long time.  The eye cream immediately moisturizes the skin under my eyes, which makes it look and feel better.  After several uses, I feel that the skin under my eyes looks rejuvinated and more youthful.  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t post reviews, but I love this product so much that I just had to! I have only been using it for about a week, but I saw a difference after the first day. I am in my early 50&#x27;s, and I started to get wrinkles and bags under my eyes. After using this product, I see a drastic improvement in the quality of my skin under my eyes. I look so much younger. I am definitely going to keep using this, and try more of their products. Amazing!</li>
    <li> This is the best cream ever for my under eyes dark circles. I will recommended to anyone with this problem.</li>
    <li> Shipped within 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;Good packaging .&lt;br /&gt;Just got this product for my under eye dark circles.It smells good .feels soft .But will know if it really works after using it for a while .&lt;br /&gt;Will update my review after 1 month for the actual results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will increase or decrease rating after 1 month.</li>
    <li> Okay…I must write a product review for this and the Face Moisturizer.  I am 51 and about 8 months ago all heck broke loose (pre-menopause) on my face! I’ve always had really good skin; never sensitive to much…in fact for years I used straight (high end) extra virgin olive oil as an evening moisturizer.  But 8 months ago I started breaking out all around the chin and mouth area (worst around the laugh lines). I tried several face creams, and toners, and washes, in the last 8 months to try and balance out the skin again. I ordered Yalmeh Aloe Face and Eye cream. The Face Moisturizer shipped first. The cream has a texture that is difficult to apply smoothly, so I wasn’t sure about it. I had to pat the Face Moisturizer on, because the consistency isn’t conducive to gliding it on; it pulled at my skin. But, I saw a reduction in the acne after the first 3 days. Then the Eye cream was received.  Now the Eye cream is smooth and rich and glides on nicely. So, I actually apply the Eye cream to my whole face, followed by the Face cream (which applies easier with the Eye cream base). After 20 or so days the acne is all clear! If I do get an occasional blemish (not a whole area) it quickly goes away! And I love the top layer of Face Moisturizer because it isn’t greasy feeling or looking. It also provides this layer of protection that I don’t notice until I wash my face; meaning it feels like the creams are absorbed fully, until I splash water on my face and feel the slickness, then I know the cream was there protecting and moisturizing my face all day. I simply love this stuff!! Oh, I also think it’s helping the smile lines at my lips less noticeable…</li>
    <li> Wonderful cream! Really works as well as a cream can work.. In love with this product. Going to try the moisturizer next..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just purchased this cream. Been using it for a few days only and noticed immediate change, I have fine lines and skin around my eyes that looks dry and dull. However, since started using this cream, my skin appears to be tighter, brighter and healthier and lines appear little less noticeable. I give it four stars for now and will come back to comment again. Waiting for some more miracle to work out.</li>
    <li> I bought this eye cream based on glowing customer reviews, and was definitely not disappointed! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week (applying morning and night) and can already notice a difference.  It goes on very light with a slight tingling sensation and instantly feels cool on my skin.  It really can be used under makeup, as well- it doesn&#x27;t clump or flake like other creams. The price is an added bonus- will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a a week or so, but so far I&#x27;m very satisfied. It goes on smoothly, no irritations. It&#x27;s hard to give an honest opinion on how it addresses dark circles, as I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to give a fair review (hence the 4 stars vs 5 stars), but I do think I have seen some improvement. Overall . . . so far . . . happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> In a matter of two weeks, saw my skin feel smoother and black eyes started to fade! Worth buying and trying.</li>
    <li> I have under eye circles that nothing seems to work much on, and this cream was no exception. Had a refreshing feeling, but did not seem to minimize eye wrinkles much either.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Good smell&lt;br /&gt;-Goes on smoothly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for over a month now and I see no difference in my undereye circles. I also found it suspicious I couldn&#x27;t find anything about this product anywhere else on the internet; this is strange considering the great rating it has here.</li>
    <li> I started using this product skeptical as usual.  I didn&#x27;t notice much the first two weeks. Then, as promised the results were amazing!  The dark circles under my eyes are completely gone!!! Don&#x27;t lose hope, keep applying a little every night and every morning... The awesome thing about it is you don&#x27;t need much AT ALL.  I actually suggest using as little as possible because a little goes a LONG way! Very happy!</li>
    <li> I started to use this product in the morning and the evening. After a few days I developed little red spots aound my eyes so I stopped using it in the morning. I only use a little bit now in the evening. Maybe I was putting too much on? It is much better now and I look forward to seeing if it will help the fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
    <li> definitely one of the best eye treatments I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> Jury is still out on long term results, but so far it works beautifully!  Very rich and moisturizing!</li>
    <li> It was deliver fast but it didn&#x27;t do anything. the eye cream was just like lotion. It had no affect on my dark circles. Trying something new now.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a little while and there is a very small change to under my eyes, but not working as good as I would have like it to.</li>
    <li> I like it and promise you won&#x27;t laugh at me!! I use it on my face and neck also!!!!!!!!! That&#x27;s why I run out of it fast!!!!!</li>
    <li> Cali Julz says...&lt;br /&gt;So far so good! Using organic ingredients never hurts, but this eye cream has some work ahead of it..lol I do have mature oily skin and I have noticed it is not responding to certain treatments anymore, Well the YALMEH Super Youth started to improve the overall look and feel of my \\&quot;crows feet\\&quot;. The texture and skin feel are great, not too heavy or greasy. A nice light scent which is nice, I was able to share with my hubby who wears contacts and the odor didn&#x27;t bother him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is so light and soft, not heavy or greasy. Smells good, has not caused any breakouts, and when I use it at night my eyes don&#x27;t look so tired in the morning. A little bit goes a long way, so It should last for a long time. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I bought this specifically for the dark rings under my eyes. I can&#x27;t say for certain that it&#x27;s working as I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month or so, but I really like the smell and texture. It&#x27;s a very good moisturizer as well. Would definitely recommend. If you&#x27;re on the fence, go for it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Although its very soon to review this since I got it only few days back but feels really good after applying this cream. I&#x27;ll surely use it for a month to notice the difference and will get back with the review</li>
    <li> I use the cream under my eyes. The cream goes on nicely and it moisturizes well. I have only used it for a little over a week, but my eyes seem to look younger.</li>
    <li> i bought this after reading all of these &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; reviews for this product. I&#x27;ve been using this for more than 4 months now (during both morning and night)and honestly my bags under my eyes look exactly the same. They haven&#x27;t disappeared after a 1 day use or up till now. I thought the reviews here were too good to be true....and to my surprise they were...I gave it 2 stars cause this product did make my eye bags feel more smooth. I&#x27;ve used about half the container now, and I&#x27;m going to try a diff product.</li>
    <li> I tried it for about a month and a half.  Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything around the eyes.  It&#x27;s actually a very nice overall face cream, so I have used it for that.  I have tried another eye cream product that seems to work.</li>
    <li> First, the packaging actually impressed me. 2nd I feel like I got an amount for my money. 3rd it smells nice; light, is soothing &amp; I actually really like it. Want to try the face creme next as I hope I like it as much as this product!</li>
    <li> Its OK, the product does moisturize however it didn&#x27;t do a whole lot for dark circles. There is a good amount of product received for the price.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an eye treatment cream that would help dimish bags and dark circles.  Yalmah&#x27;s eye cream did nothing!!!</li>
    <li> This is the kind of cream you put on and your skin just goes &amp;#34;aaaahhhh&amp;#34;.  This eye cream feels light yet makes the skin around my eyes feel moist and soft.  I have not used it long enough yet to attest to wrinkle improvement but I will continue using it and recommend it.</li>
    <li> So far i havent seen a difference at all and its been a couple of weeks. Im hoping i do see a difference around my eye area in a couple of months. I have really bad dark circles and bags under my eyes its embarrassing to me. I hate being asked if im tired or being told i need sleep.</li>
    <li> smooth, easy to use; helpful directions provided in advance and after arrival.  Arrived on time as expected.  Seems to be helping, although only 3 days used so far.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for over a week and I am really seeing a difference around my eyes. My wrinkles look considerably less as do my age spots. My wife was so impressed that she has been trying it for two days and loves it and wants her own now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first cream that I can actually endorse and will keep using. I am really glad I stumbled upon this product on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Feel ok with it, comparing with the KIEHL&#x27;s eye alert, it&#x27;s better to be used as night cream. It won&#x27;t save you from swelling or puffiness which already there, but it does make it keep away from getting worse.</li>
    <li> I purchased this eye cream hoping for a change.  I did like the creaminess of the product, but it did nothing for my puffy eyes.  I still use just to moisturize that eye area.  :(</li>
    <li> I have just been using this a little over a week and I like the cream but can&#x27;t tell if it really works yet.it feels very nice and not heavy or irritating and I love the customer service appreciation. Not many companies care enough to inquire if you are happy with their product but this one does. I will continue to use and see if it makes a difference. I gave it 4 stars because of time used.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really made a difference in my dark circles and wrinkles and I love the way that it smells! I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love Yalmeh Peerless Beauty. I honestly think I can see some results. The wrinkles around my eyes look softer. I will probably order more.  Mrs. Gary Collins</li>
    <li> I thought I would try it based on the other reviews I read. I&#x27;m so glad I did. Very nice product. This is a skin treatment, yet it did not make my eyes red. I&#x27;m in my fifties, and can&#x27;t stop the wrinkles, but it did soften them and I have noticed a change now that I have used it for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I was quite surprised that my dark circles appear to be less prominent.  I have spent a lot of money on skin care products.  I&#x27;m very happy with the product and price.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this eye cream. Im very young and I have dark circles. To begin with, it arrived fast in perfect conditions and well packaging. I use it at nights and it feels very good when i apply it. Its been a week and i can already see results so fast! I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> So far the smell is wonderful and it glides on . It feels nice and I&#x27;m waking up refreshed . Just using for one week so it is to soon to tell but I like it overall and my skin is softer</li>
    <li> I did use this cream for over 2 months,it made my wrinkles, even worse, , it&#x27;s absolutely not working.When you purchased this item,the sellers will call you,and they will offer you some discount, for your next purchase, after you write a good review about this eye cream!!!so don&#x27;t blive all this recommendations.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best eye cream that I&#x27;ve ever used. The reviews were excellent. Buy more than 1 and save lots on shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Beverly</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but expected more from it with the reviews. It is pretty much like a lot of other face creams.</li>
    <li> I use this eye cream under my eyes, over my cheeks, around my nose and other areas that tend to get dry and I have no complaints. It absorbs really quickly and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out in any way or give me that stinging feeling that a lot of others creams tend to do. I have a combination of dry and oily skin (sensitive as well) and this really helps give my face that extra moisture without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> Really like this stuff.  I used it daily.  I really notice a difference in my skin, especially my dark circles. I was really skeptical about the product but was very surprise how fast it works.  I have been using for about 2 weeks now.  I am african american and my dark circles have become noticeably lighter.</li>
    <li> With my pale skin, dark under eye circles are often a huge problem. And as adorable as raccoons are, I don&#x27;t necessarily want to resemble one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always happy to try out any product that might help with this issue. YALMEH&#x27;s Super Youth Eye Cream sounded like the perfect treatment, with it&#x27;s combination of Organic Aloe, Alpha Lipoic and Alpha Hydroxy acids which work by removing old skin, allowing new skin to be produced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all I love the dreamy, beautiful watercolor packaging. Before I even opened the box, I felt like I was in for  a treat. The product itself is super creamy, rich and soft without being greasy or sticky. The scent is also really nice- not chemical or overpoweringly cloying- just a soft, clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with helping dark circles, the cream also purports to help minimize fine lines, not only around the eye area, but also around the mouth and on the forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of testing, I do feel like it made my delicate under eye area firmer and more supple. The cream definitely makes your skin silky smooth to the touch anywhere you apply it. I think I&#x27;d have to test it for a longer time to learn if it truly helps reduce wrinkles or remove dark circles. I can only see it continuing to improve my skin with regular use and since it&#x27;s ingredients are all-natural, I don&#x27;t have to worry about any creeping chemicals harming my skin over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to say yay for no animal testing! All beauty companies should be encouraged to follow suit.</li>
    <li> Who likes having dark circles and wrinkles under their eyes?  I don&#x27;t think anyone would answer yes to that question.  Yalmeh has created a product that works great for reducing all of the bags, dark circles, wrinkles and more from your eyes and tone/firm them up to take  years off of your look!  You can get .5 oz in a skinny tube which is what I received, or you can choose the 1 oz jar - either would fit easily into a makeup bag or purse and you can use anytime.  It leaves no residue and comes with a 90 day money back guarantee.  The company is completely cruelty-free and the products are all-natural, they contain no toxic chemicals or cancer causing additives - no mineral oil, propylene glycol or paraben.  It removes the dead skin cells and helps to firm up the skin with Organic Aloe, Alpha Lipoic and Alpha Hydroxy acids.  This product used to come in a jar but now it comes in a squeezable tube to help make it easier to use and smaller packaging.  Either way it is a great cream to use and will definitely help your eyes look better!  I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I waited until I finished the entire container before leaving a review because I wanted to see if there were actually noticeable results.  And there are!  The fine lines that had begun appearing around my eyes are noticeable smoother.  Would definitely recommend this product for someone looking to prevent fine lines and wrinkles from forming / getting worse.</li>
    <li> Did not live up to my expectations.</li>
    <li> This men eye cream is amazing. I love that it does have pleasant fragrance Ginger &amp; White Tea  which is 100% organic, and it feels so light and refreshing on my face and around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I can feel my skin hydrating whenever I apply it, and a little goes a long way with having 50g jar. It&#x27;s the best eye cream for men. I would definitely recommend this Eye Cream for night eye cream and eye cream for wrinkle as well as age eye cream.</li>
    <li> I was a visitor in from Hong Kong when I ordered this in US. I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months and I think a jar of 50g can last for 9, which is very good! What&#x27;s more it works! I am in my 50&#x27;s but &amp;#34;my skin is a lot more youthful as compared with other women of same age&amp;#34;, my daughter commented as I was her model for made up practice. This is very very good!</li>
    <li> I really needed this product, very very good</li>
    <li> Softened my skin but did not help the dark circles.</li>
    <li> I have been using the eye cream for 1 week.  At this time I do not see any benefits. I would like to&lt;br /&gt;give it another week and then reevaluate product</li>
    <li> The order was received on time.  I have used this cream for a couple months and have noticed some fine lines aren&#x27;t as noticeable.  It does seem a little greasy but a tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> At this time in my life, I make it a point to purchase products that contain natural ingredients as much as possible.  Although, I have yet to try my Yalmeh Aloe Super Youth Eye Cream, since I am being economical and want to use the eye cream I have on hand first.  When I read the contents of this product and the great recommendations from other buyers, I just had to purchase this product.  Also, the seller has been wonderful in keeping in contact with me and offering helpful hints on how this product should be used.  That is very rare to have a buyer contact you and offer further assistance in the use of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I have had an opportunity to use my Yalmeh Aloe Super Youth Eye Cream, I will reply will an updated review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cynthia</li>
    <li> There is something about this stuff that makes my skin look like I am younger. If you put too much of it on it can leave a little film though. I swear that I have never seen my skin look this good. I keep looking at where my eyes would get puffy and wrinkly, but there gone! I have become more either more vain or I am still trying to figure out what happen to my wrinkles and puffy eyes, because I can&#x27;t stop looking in the mirror lol. Really good stuff, I am impressed.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  I have only used it once and the dark circles are noticeably diminished.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has dark circles.  As far as wrinkles I really don&#x27;t think anything except a procedure at a doctors office is going to work on those but we will see.  After using it at night the next morning underneath my eyes were brighter and very soft.  I placed the order on Friday evening and received the product Monday,  very quick shipping.  For the price I would definitely try this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about a week now and i must say that a little goes a long way. I noticed my skin smoother in the morning and less stressed as usual. My wife made me get this for her and forced me to get one for myself as well. I am glad i did and will be purchasing more in the near future!:)))</li>
    <li> First I ordered it on 12/24 &amp; I got it on 12/27. Upon opening it, I dab amicroscopic amount on my hand, OMG my hand felt like velvet. I cant wait to try this on my face. Will let you know how I make out. Until then.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older (late 50s), I&#x27;ve been unsatisfied with the expensive eye creams I&#x27;ve been buying from department stores. Maybe they are doing their job under my skin, but the skin around my eyes always looked and felt fragile and dry. I decided to go off the radar and purchase a product I didn&#x27;t see in stores, and gave this product a try - Yalmeh Aloe Super Youth Eye Cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for one week so far, and am impressed. It has a thicker, richer feel and the skin around my eyes feels more hydrated and healthy. The proof will be months down the road, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for just over a month. I have noticed some softening of lines around my eyes, my eyes are usually very sensitive to any product but this is very soothing. I was impressed with how little it takes. Using twice daily one jar will probably last at least 3 months.</li>
    <li> have only used for 1 week but seems to be making a difference.  Will keep using and most likely order more</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this stuff really is NOT worth the money in my opinion! I tried it, and it keep leaving dried little bits everywhere on my face. I thought I just had dry skin or something, but no…I stopped using this product, and I didn&#x27;t find any; then started using it again, thinking I was just being paranoid. But nope. It was this. And I moisturized a little bit, but not more than any other quality moisturizer. I really don&#x27;t think it was worth it.</li>
    <li> The cream is smooth and feels good on my skin around the eyes and lips.  My skin is sensitive and I have not noticed any problems.  I have only used it for a week so I cannot write that much.  It takes time for creams to take its effect.  I definitely like it and hope it is going to get better with time.</li>
    <li> I gave this product a 5 star for the great customer service.  I have not had enough time to evaluate the product yet.  They don&#x27;t give you enough time before asking for a review.  Some products break me out with excema so I haven&#x27;t had enough time to know.  I feel that the company will stand by the product at any rate.  They also say in their sheet when you recieve it that if you do have problem, to use it less often and that that usually takes care of it. It feels wonderful upon application.  Good communication about the product from the company!</li>
    <li> This has a wonderful texture and I am already seeing results after a few weeks of use.  I will be looking into the other products by Yalmeh based on my experience with this eye cream and I will be purchasing this again</li>
    <li> Really like this eye cream and their moisturizer is perfect for night time use. Try this if you have skin you want to age gracefully.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this Eye Cream . As Usual for the price I had my doubts But Boy Am I Thankful for taking THIS RISK !&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a month I decided to order more so maybe I could still get a discounted price . And I Did ! Not Only does this Eye Cream feel like it is strong enough to rival the Retin-A, Glycolic Acid,VitaminC, &amp; all Alpha-Hydroxy Acids for Obtaining that youthful &amp;#34;No-Bag, No Dark Circles,No Fine Lines&amp; No Puffiness But It Also FEELS LUXURIOUS ! Moisturizing ! Cool! And Doesn&#x27;t Irritate My Eyes like Those Other &amp;#34;Expensive Snake Oils&amp;#34; . It Soothes  and is Creamy and Lasts Forever !  I Love using it with my Lancôme Concealer because it eases application of the rather &#x27;Heavy&#x27; Brighttner. And I Never &#x27;Tear&#x27; or Pull the delicate eye area skin. It is very Silky. Trust Me Ladies I&#x27;m 55 yrs old &amp; have tried it ALL !  You won&#x27;t regret this Purchase ! And Your Welcome !</li>
    <li> I feel it is a little early to leave a review, but I will say that I have been using it now for two weeks and I notice that my skin is more smooth, slightly brighter and softer. As for the dark circles around the eyes, I do not see a difference as of yet but it is still very early to tell. This is why I will give it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> Skin type: combination (oily in T-zone, normal/dry elsewhere)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard great reviews about this product from an online article, and thought I would try it. I&#x27;m in my late 20s, but I&#x27;ve already begun to get smile lines around the corners of my eyes (probably due to a. the amount of smiling I do and b. the amount of sugar I consume - and water I don&#x27;t consume).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to get the Neutrogena one, but decided to pay a little extra and go for this product since it received such great reviews. I used it as my night cream the day I got it. The next morning, my skin felt suuuuper soft. It looked glowy/dewy, and my smile lines had decreased significantly. I don&#x27;t know what they put in this stuff or how they make it work that fast, but it does. It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its long-term effects are questionable (I only got it two weeks ago or so). On nights I haven&#x27;t used it, my skin doesn&#x27;t look as great the next morning. Every time I do use it, my skin looks amazing the next day (for the whole day).</li>
    <li> I feel it revives my eyes when i feel very tired.</li>
    <li> I have just finished my first jar of this and really like it.  I didn&#x27;t notice results right away but after two weeks my skin really started to improve. Wrinkles diminished, skin very soft.  I have already bought another jar!  I have now added Amara Vitamin C serum with this and wow, is the combination really helping my skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for a few months now. I&#x27;m very pleased. It&#x27;s an amazing eye cream. I can&#x27;t believe the results. I&#x27;d wake up to dry, tight skin before using this product. Finally my eye area is moisturized fine lines are gone. I&#x27;ve used just about everything I will sticking to this line permanently.</li>
    <li> I suffer from chronic dark circles under my eyes.  I get plenty of rest and exercise but I also spend 10 hours a day in front of a computer screen for work.  It makes me look chronically tired.  This product definitely helps with that.  I&#x27;ve tried other products before and I usually end up having an allergic reaction under my eyes.  I don&#x27;t have that problem here.  This is a generous size as it does not take very much.  I&#x27;ve had the same jar over a month now.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> read the reviews for this product and looked forward to using it on my face. I was disappointed in that it really does not do much for the dark circles/puffs under my eyes nor did it diminish the &amp;#34;marionette lines&amp;#34; on either side of my mouth. It moisturizes, but that&#x27;s about it. will still look for another natural product that can perhaps do more...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many eye creams and this one is one of my favorites!  It relieves stress under my eyes almost instantly and feels great on my skin!</li>
    <li> The company seems to have an interest in their customer&#x27;s opinions which is a nice surprise. The first application of this cream seemed to go on so smoothly. I think that the area around the eyes looked nicer with the earliest applications.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many VERY expensive eye creams... Now &amp; then I try a value priced product.  Thank goodness I did, based on the reviews from others (thanks much ladies;) I bought this.  The appearance of the skin around my eyes looks just as good, if not better, than the overpriced 1/2 ounce pumps (that seem to stop pumping before the product is even gone).  I have extended using this cream to areas beyond my immediate eye area, as suggested, since there is 3x  more product than I&#x27;m used to having in an eye cream.  I will be a repeat buyer &amp; hope they don&#x27;t raise prices or reduce volume just because they are so good ;)  I have been using this for 2 months now.  I am 53 &amp; sorry, it doesn&#x27;t remove puffiness, may reduce it slightly - but puffiness is below the skin level, I know us ladies are a hopeful lot, but I doubt any topical product can do much there...</li>
    <li> The Super Youth Eye Cream by Yalmeh arrived in a blue box. The jar inside is color white with a dark blue label. The cream has a white and creamy texture. It has a light fresh scent with a hint of mint in it which actually smells nice. This is a compliment from me because I usually don&#x27;t like products with minty scents. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Super Youth Eye Cream has a cool effect on my skin when I apply it. I wash my face first prior to applying the Youth Eye Cream and I decided to apply it on my cheeks and my forehead. I don&#x27;t have fine lines around my eyes yet but I have fine lines on my forehead so since the Super Youth Eye Cream can be used on the forehead, I used it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Super Youth Eye Cream by Yalmeh absorbs really quickly. Since I have an oily skin type, it tends to make my skin oilier when I use it everyday so, I use it every other day or just thrice a week to balance it out. It gives my skin a tightening feeling when I apply this which is nice because I feel like it works. It didn&#x27;t clog my pores so no breakouts for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free sample to inspect, try and review however, all opinions are unbiased, honest and my own. No other form of compensation was received.</li>
    <li> Not sure of he I like product.  Only used fr a week...Won&#x27;t know until I have used for awhile which was mentioned in the ad.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Great service! Seller shipped my item instantly! It came in 2 days! Umm..WOW. I ordered one for myself months ago. I loved the cream so much, had to order one for my sister. I have hereditary dark circles, and this cream really lightened them so much. My eyes look fresh now when I wake up in the morning. It does not have a strong scent, and just a tiny bit goes a long way! I still have 80% of the cream left and I have been using this product for 3 months. This product would be great for a working MOM in need of some awesome eye care! TRY IT OUT!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Have been using this cream for a month now and notice the darkness under my eyes isn&#x27;t as noticeable and the fine lines less visible.  It has a great smooth texture and a little bit goes a long way!  I just ordered my second bottle and would highly reccommend this cream.</li>
    <li> Use on entire face. Definitely eliminated tired eye look. Put on and let it absorb follow by a natural face primer</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been about a week since I started using Yalmeh but so far so good.  It has a light, pleasant scent.  Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  It is not at all greasy.  I hope the longer term results live up to the other reviews!</li>
    <li> I just received this eye cream and started using it right away. I was told that result should be seen after at least three weeks of use. As right now I noticed that I don&#x27;t have an allergic reaction on it, since I have sensitive skin and I cannot use just any cream, and it is a good sign. I like the smell and texture and looking forward to see the promised result:)</li>
    <li> I do not give reviews very often it happens like a leap year. I wanted to use this product for several weeks before I write anything about it. I have dry skin and flaky skin close to my eye area and I tried everything from high end products like Shiseido to Lancome and they just made it worse. Yalmeh actually moisturized the area and took away the flakiness. What I like is a little dab goes a very long way, I use it everyday and my jar still looks full.&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend for people who have dark circles and uneven eyelids from lack of sleep because being a college student I tend to not sleep much and I had&lt;br /&gt;those problems as well and it helped my puffiness go down and my eyelids look normal now. My dark circles have faded as well and it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks of usage.</li>
    <li> This cream has a delightful scent, light body, and seems to be hydrating my skin nicely.  I really have enjoyed using it and will be ordering more.... Today.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a couple of weeks, I can see that the redness around my eyes has diminished.  I am very much interested in natural beauty products, essential oils, and anti-aging.  I like that this contains vitamins E and C and other natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Love this cream, works well, and miss it if I run out.  My daughter keeps stealing it though and she doesn&#x27;t need it!  She says it works for bags under her eyes when she does not sleep well before a day of school.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with the product yet so I left it at 3 stars. Hoping for a response from the manufacture on if my scenario is normal and ok to use. I ordered this just prior to the holiday week, and essentially it sat in my mail box in 105+ degrees for a few days while I was away. When I opened it the product had separated into a solid and a liquid. I tried to stir it back together but it is still somewhat clumpy. Is the product ok to use in this condition? I will update my review when I have more experience with the product.</li>
    <li> Very good quality and a great price... Highly recommend and I am an educated fussy buyer</li>
    <li> Only been using for one week, we&#x27;ll see if there are any results in a month or so. Hopefully it is the best eye cream</li>
    <li> I LIKE IT ALOT IT MAKES MY SKIN SOFTER AROUND MY EYES, AND BRIGHTER.  I  HAVE LIGHT DARK CIRCLES FROM MY ALLERGIES AND IT IS HELPING THEM.  GREAT PRODUCT WOULD DEFINITELY PURCHASE AGAIN ALONG WITH THE FACE CREAM BOTH GREAT PRODUCTS!!</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful as you apply it.  Seems to just melt into the skin.  I will purchase it again for sure!</li>
    <li> This products does as it has been promised also Yalmeh people keep following up on it.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. but make sure to follow instructions....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 3 weeks, so I&#x27;m not sure I can speak to any particular results. What I can say is that it&#x27;s ultra moisturizing, and makes the skin around my eyes look and feel really soft.  I&#x27;m hoping that it becomes a staple product for me because the price is fantastic!</li>
    <li> So, I bought this primarily as a moisturizer to put around my eyes before bed time. Wrinkles aren&#x27;t especially a problem for me, but I&#x27;m trying to be a little proactive about preventing them. The Yalmeh eye cream is fine. The smell reminds me a little of my grandmother — it&#x27;s inoffensive, but nothing remarkable. Can I say I&#x27;ve seen a difference? No, but as I said, I don&#x27;t have much in the way of crow&#x27;s feet anyway. As a moisturizer, I have the utmost confidence that it&#x27;s doing its job admirably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little difficult to get excited about a product like this. It has one job to do. It&#x27;s like toilet paper: sure, there are a few levels of varying quality, but fundamentally it just serves a fairly routine purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That leads me to explain why I&#x27;m bothering to leave this review at all. I typically only bother writing reviews for products about which I feel strongly, one way or the other. In this case, I&#x27;m doing it in the fervent hope that the manufacturer, Yalmeh, will leave me alone. Since purchasing this eye cream, I&#x27;ve received several emails from them, couched as helpful &amp;#34;how to use the product&amp;#34; messages (seriously? it&#x27;s eye cream — how much explanation does it require?) but with an underlying plea for me to write a review. This has culminated in a *telephone call* from an unfamiliar 866 number last night, which I did not answer. I did a reverse lookup this morning, only to discover that it was from (you guessed it) Yalmeh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me reiterate: Yalmeh actually called my phone number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not entirely sure where they got it, but I do find it profoundly inappropriate for a company to make unsolicited calls to customers who bought their product, particularly through a site like Amazon. Since I didn&#x27;t answer, and there was no voicemail, I can only surmise they wanted to make sure I didn&#x27;t have any questions concerning the (evidently) complicated eye cream application process. Oh, and to ask if I&#x27;d write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, here it is. You win, Yalmeh. I&#x27;m writing a review for your eye cream. Please stop emailing and don&#x27;t ever call again.&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, here it is. You win, Yalmeh. I&#x27;m writing a review for your eye cream. Please stop emailing and don&#x27;t ever call again.</li>
    <li> ok the smell is wonderful as someone else stated.  I use this all over my face and yes a very small amount goes a long long ways.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results.</li>
    <li> Great seller and product.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of eye creams recently and they all work to some extent. I really like the Yalmeh super youth eye cream. I&#x27;ve noticed that as I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;m starting to see age spots on my face. Not very bad at this time so now is the time when I want to find something that will work. I did see some improvement but not a drastic improvement. I have been using it for about three weeks now. I sometimes get dark circles under my eyes when I can&#x27;t sleep at night and haven&#x27;t seen much difference in the way of the taking away of the dark circles under my eyes. It does however work AMAZING as a moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Super Youth Eye Cream contains vitamin C and E. I think these vitamins work very well in the eye cream. I did as they said and made sure that my face was cleaned first and then dipped my middle finger into the cream and put little dots under my eyes. One thing it didn&#x27;t say and I&#x27;ve been told to ALWAYS do this when applying moisturizer is to apply in upward strokes from under the eye, around the eye and then up. This reduces the likelihood of making more wrinkles as the skin under your eyes is very sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love this as a moisturizer and did notice a subtle lessening of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on customer reviews, and the all natural ingredients. Well....... i am so happy i took the time to read reviews on different products, otherwise i wouldn&#x27;t have found yalmeh. This is truly, in my opinion, \\&quot; a hidden gem\\&quot;  hense the title an unexpected treasure!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have seen a definite change. I use the eye cream as directed. The cream is gentle so there is no allergic reaction. It softens any noticeable lines leaving a more youthful appearance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for several months on my entire face not just my eyes and I&#x27;m seeing great changes.  A little bit goes a long way so the jar lasts forever,  The smell is very nice too.  I just ordered my second jar!!</li>
    <li> Great treatment creme.  Large amount at a good price.  Impressed that I, who have used ALMOST ALL HIGH END FACE AND EYE CREMES WITH LITTLE OR NO RESULTS, saw improvement after 3 days!!!!!!! Definitely a keeper, trying their other products.  In expensive for a multi- tasking treament creme.  Love it, love it, love it!  Does what it says at a good price point!!!! Follow directions and you will see a difference!</li>
    <li> Nice eye cream, but not a miracle worker.</li>
    <li> So far this product has kept my eye area very hydrated which can make all the difference in making eyes look younger. I have not used it long enough to vouch that is has been a miracle product. Ur not greasy or poor clogging and very soothing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy about this cream , work great , thanks</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I can definitely see results. I have zero crows feet and it helps with the under eye worries as well.</li>
    <li> I just love that product. My second jar.</li>
    <li> Yalmeh Super Youth Eye Cream is great.  No strong fragrance and feels wonderful</li>
    <li> So far I like the cream. Goes on well, and seems to be working. Fast, friendly service also.</li>
    <li> Great eye cream. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I use a few Yalmeh products, and I like every one. I really love the Super Youth Eye Cream. I have had it for a few months now and absolutely love the results I get from it. I use it at night along with the Yalmeh Bright Eye Gel and again in the morning with another cream I have and I can&#x27;t believe how bright and vibrant my eyes look. I have had dark circles for as long as I can remember and never look like I get enough sleep-even when I do. (which, I may add, isn&#x27;t overly often) The problem with these dark circles and bags under the eyes is, they make me look much older than I do and I can&#x27;t stand it. With the Yalmeh Eye Cream along with a couple of other creams I use, I don&#x27;t have that issue anymore. I don&#x27;t get told I look like I&#x27;m in my late thirties or early forties, but now I look like I&#x27;m low twenties or teens. (which is still much closer to reality.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the light scent it has and that it absorbs quickly. I also like that it feels like it instantly tightens and tones the skin around my eyes and leaves them moist and hydrated. This eye cream is a much better value than others. Many eye creams come in a small container, this one is in a larger container than many and costs less than most while working effectively making it completely worth the investment. I really love this eye cream and plan to use it for years to come along with my other creams to stave off the signs of aging and keep my skin looking young and healthy.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It feels great on my skin, especially around the sensitive eye area.  I cannot say I am seeing a huge difference in my eyes, but I have not been using it for a really long time.  Once I use it a few more months and I see any changes, I will add that to my review.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for almost 3 months and don&#x27;t see any difference in reduction in dark circles or wrinkles.  It does make the skin around the eye soft.</li>
    <li> Love this cream. Nice light texture and pleasnt scent. This is my second jar. Love how it feels and softens my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a little over a month now. I have used higher end eye creams (ie Obagi) and this works just as well, if not a bit better. I don&#x27;t feel any irritation when applying it and my eyes are a bit lighter since I have severe dark circles due to allergies. Its help a little with my wrinkles but not vanished them. One key thing is that after a night of application my eyes wont be irritated and they are not dry, which helps with the make up application in the morning,  I don&#x27;t have to over apply eye cream in the morning and over apply concealer. As a matter a fact, I&#x27;ve been wearing less concealer this winter.&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I had used much more expensive eye creams with little results. The one thing I would suggest for the manufacturer is to create a way to dispense the cream better, such as a tube. Sometimes if I&#x27;m not  careful, I will dip my finger to much in the cream and you don&#x27;t really need a whole lot of product for it  to be effective. Needles to say, even though I would prefer different packaging I will still be buying  this again.</li>
    <li> I not only use it for my eyes.  I use it on my face.  I really like it.  It makes my faces feel replenished.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  Smooths out surface wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for good skin care products, and i think this is another good item. The eyecream has helped the dark circles under my eyes disappear! The downside is that it makes your skin sensitive to the sun.</li>
    <li> I love this product because I can put it on each morning before putting on my makeup. I bought this product for wrinkle prevention when noticing the first signs of wrinkles near the eye. I have been using it for nearly a year now each morning and although I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference, I do think it has minimized and slowed the process down a bit. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Within one week I noticed much clearer, more hydrated complexion. I use this on my entire face, however, I concentrate it more so under my eyes and on my smile lines. This is my second time purchasing this and I can say it is very consistent. It is thick enough to not require you to use more than a nickel-size (which should make it last a relatively long time if you use it at night time only), but at the same time it is not too heavy or grey to make you feel weighed down. I will definitely buy this again, as well as try their other products.</li>
</ol>
