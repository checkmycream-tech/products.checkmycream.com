<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this conditioner just wanting to try something different. When it arrived, I tried and didn&#x27;t think it was all that special. I went through the whole bottle and didn&#x27;t see it do much for my hair. The smell isn&#x27;t that great either. I&#x27;ve gone back to my usual conditioner (John Frieda) now and it&#x27;s less money and works so much better. This conditioner reminded me of cheap conditioners I used to use and would always have to use a lot of to smooth and detangle my long hair.</li>
    <li> This is some good conditioner.  It makes your hair so soft and smell so good.  I also brought the shampoo....same smell.  I will buy this again.  Just love it!</li>
    <li> I like its shampoo but not the conditioner. Its very runny. It does not give you much softening unless you put it on for like 10 minutes. No one has time for that. I usually put on this conditioner and start shaving my legs. It takes that long to moisturize your hair. I won&#x27;t recommend this for people with thick hair.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the smell or how my hair is with it. The only thing I will say is that it does make your hair dry faster.</li>
    <li> The best conditioner ever</li>
    <li> It smells great but I have to say IMO my pantene works alot better. Probally depends on your hair type.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used.  I have curly unmanagable hair that I try to straighten without it taking forever.  With this conditioner it cuts my time in half and makes my hair very managable</li>
    <li> While the Agadir shampoo has a strong fragrance, the conditioner is mild.  A small amount goes a long way and I like the way it goes onto my hair and scalp.  I intend to purchase this product again when I use up the 12 oz bottle .</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, curly blonde hair... this is NOT the product for that type of hair.  This \\&quot;Moisturizing\\&quot; conditioner is the most drying conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  It does NOT detangle, the smell is like cloying, overpowering and CHEAP perfume!  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been so disappointed in a product like this.  I love Argan oil and have typically had good experiences with these types of products but this one has really left me disappointed.  I ordered the shampoo with the conditioner and it hasn&#x27;t even come in yet and I&#x27;m scared to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another issue I have with this product is the sheer volume you have to use to see ANY results.  I probably used an 1/8 of the bottle to TRY to condition my hair.  Also, more of my hair came out while I was \\&quot;finger-combing\\&quot; my hair during the conditioning process - literally a handful of hair came out.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner for making my hair tangle-free and smooth without dragging it down, but the smell is a bit overwhelming. Not that it leaves too strong of a scent after you get out of the shower, but while using it the smell is very strong. I may be more sensitive to fragrances then most, but if strong scents are a no-no, you shouldn&#x27;t buy this conditioner. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a pretty good product.</li>
    <li> I use MorrocanOil conditioner, thought I would give this a try since it has Argan Oil,, Smells nice but didnt conditon that great. Dissapointed!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this line of products recently through my salon. After shopping around, I found them on Amazon.com for half the price of the salon. Let me say - I love this product line! I use the shampoo, conditioner, and finishing oil treatment each time I wash. I have wavy/curly, thick textured hair, and this product line is great for controlling my frizz and smoothing my curls without causing too much heaviness. My curls are defined, light, and bouncy. I also really love the scent. I live in an area with high humidity almost all year round. Spring and Summer are especially difficult times of year to keep my hair tame. I find this product line has been the best I have ever tried for battling humid conditions, and I have tried many, many other products. On particularly humid days, adding a little extra finishing oil treatment to my dry hair tames the frizzies every time.</li>
    <li> I love my Argan Oil leave-in treatment, so when I needed to change to a sulfate- and NaCl-free shampoo after my Brazilian Blowout, I decided to go with the matching Agadir Argan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner, because I didn&#x27;t like the scent or the feel of the products the salon recommended. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. They smell \\&quot;spicy clean\\&quot; as another reviewer described it, a scent that&#x27;s neither feminine nor masculine, and unlike some other brands, don&#x27;t leave my hair smelling like cooking oil after a few days. Even after using all three products--the Argan Oil Shampoo, the Argan Oil Conditioner and a healthy amount of Argan Oil Leave-in Treatment (the size of a quarter for my chin-length hair), my hair is silky smooth, soft, shiny but never oily and it doesn&#x27;t attract dirt. The Brazilian Blowout is holding up as it should, but now that it&#x27;s 6 weeks old, it&#x27;s got some nice body and life to it at the roots without loss of control and ease further down the strand, and I can tell I&#x27;m going to get quite a few more months before I have to repeat that treatment, thanks to my Agadir trio of products, which weren&#x27;t expensive, as salon-quality products go.    What&#x27;s more? When I went back to the salon at 6 weeks for a trim, both the shampoo girl and my stylist commented on how soft and manageable my hair was and wanted to know what I was using. They used their products while I was there, and I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hair when I got home so I could get back to the honest clean of the Agadir products, with the natural body and softness, the silky smooth strands, with good volume and no \\&quot;gummed up\\&quot; feel. I&#x27;ll never use anything else in my hair again, whether my hair is long or short. And I only have to wash my hair every 5 or 6 days, too. With the old shampoos and conditioners and the residues they leave behind, plus the anti-frizz products I had to use on top of them, I was shampooing to get the build-up out at least every 3 - 4 days.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing! My hair feels and smells great! Love this product!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this after reading some of the reviews.  Its does have a nice scent but for my hair it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work well.  My hair is full of tangles whenever I use this which is very disappointing.  I think for the price, I could do better so I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I think Agadir is a good product. However, the Argardir conditioner I bought through this merchant was thinner than the shampoo; watered down, I believe.</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner along with the shampoo and oil. I normally use Biolage ColorCare, but wanted to try these products because the reviews were so good. I have long, straight hair which I color and use a flat iron on. It tends to get a little frizzy and I like a smooth, sleek look. I was hoping these products would strengthen and protect my hair from damage and create a silky smooth feel. I&#x27;ve used them all together for about 3 or 4 weeks now. The shampoo was thick and luxurious, but overly scented. The oil was okay, but I think Chi Silk Infusion results in a smoother, silkier touch. I used about a nickel sized amount in the palm of my hand and worked through wet hair before drying and straightening, then used a few drops more on dry hair which did result in a smooth feel - though not as nice as Chi. The conditioner was really thin and I have to use AT LEAST 3 times more of it than the shampoo. It works well if you use enough of it, providing good detangling and a smooth feel for my long straight hair, but it certainly is no bargain. I am close to finishing the bottle of conditioner and still have over half of the shampoo and oil remaining. I wouldn&#x27;t buy any of the products again because:  1. the shampoo scent is way too strong and while not unpleasant, I prefer to smell my perfume rather than my shampoo throughout the day  2. there are other products that perform as good as or better than the oil and don&#x27;t cost any more  3. the conditioner is way too thin and poor value because of that  So, does my seem hair stronger and more resistant to damage, softer and silkier to the touch? I would have to say no. I was hoping for a noticeable difference and just don&#x27;t see it. These products are okay, but not superior to other products I have used.</li>
    <li> I love the Argon Oil and use it every day.  I decided to try the conditioner.  It smells great and feels great while the conditioner is on the hair, but as soon as it&#x27;s rinsed, my hair feels as if I hadn&#x27;t used a conditioner at all.  I have to use a detangler before I brush after washing.    I will not buy this product again.  Still love the oil though!</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner, I use it every time I wash and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy.</li>
    <li> Not only is this product amazing on my dry overly-processed, delicate hair...but it smells absolutely divine!  The product leaves my hair healthy-looking without being greasy.  I am hooked!  Thanks Amazon for carrying this great product!</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this conditioner.  And it is very thick.  While I&#x27;m not a fan of the shampoo, I use this conditioner every time I wash my girls&#x27; hair.</li>
    <li> Smells great and leaves my hair softer from all the damage i put it through. Works well with the shampoo</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick, curly, coarse hair. I swear I wake up every day and the under layer of my hair is completely dreaded. I have to pick it out with a comb almost every day... So I was excited to be getting a conditioner that everyone raved about! I was hoping it would magically turn my unruly curls into angelic bouncing ringlets of softness and glory. Perhaps that was unrealistic? But it&#x27;s nice conditioner... smells really good, and my hair is always nice and smooth after. But the wind didn&#x27;t change directions and birds didn&#x27;t sing and the planets didn&#x27;t align. It&#x27;s nice conditioner but a little out of my price range considering my usual tennis ball-sized glob of Pantene has about the same effect...  Lesson learned: if you&#x27;ve got out of control curls, even really nice conditioner probably won&#x27;t tame them. But if you want some nice conditioner that smells good and leaves your hair soft, this stuff is good!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo &amp; conditioner! My hair feels so soft and smells so nice! I was truly amazed at how soft my hair was after I let my hair air dry. Made my hair feel so clean! I can get away without washing my hair for three days when using this shampoo and conditioner combo. My hair never looked greasy, stayed fresh, and there was no need for dry shampoo in between washings. I usually have to wash every day - every other day.  I thought this shampoo lathered up nicely and a quarter sized amount was perfect for my elbow length hair.   The conditioner was definitely thinner and less rich then what I am used to, but the same quarter sized amount worked just fine to condition my ends and give great results. It just took some getting used to, because I&#x27;m used to having a thick conditioner.  Would definitely recommend and will buy again!</li>
    <li> Great product! Used with the shampoo and treatment oil, my hair is now amazing. This conditioner is very light, but it leaves my hair soft and manageable, with no frizzies! Rinses clean with no residue.</li>
    <li> I just recently switched to this shampoo/conditioner. I was previously using CHI products and WEN.  Both are ok for a little bit but over time WEN builds up on your hair and CHI gave me a drying effect.  So far, Agadir has done neither.  Now, I am not crazy about the smell.  I prefer something more feminine and vibrant smelling.  This product is a strange smell, not bad but not great either.  Next I will order the hair oil.  I am curious how that will be.  Overall, I am really liking the effect this shampoo/conditioner is having on my hair.  My husband commented yesterday that my hair looked so \\&quot;light\\&quot; (as in not weighed down) and \\&quot;shiny\\&quot;.  Thats pretty much the first time he has ever said anything like that.  If your thinking about this product give it a try.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised.  If you are use to cheaper shampoos (suave/pantene/vive ext), you may not like the increase in cost.  However, I find it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this conditioner after using the oil treament for a while .. I have been using it on a daily basis and is great, specially now that we are on vacacion here in florida and we&#x27;re swimming everyday... my hair is long and the conditioner leaves a nice shine and softeness to it.. is a very good product.. the scent to it is the same as the oil, a bit exotic but nice..</li>
    <li> I have used this conditioner-and the shampoo-for about 2 years now.I&#x27;ve found it to be very kind to my Goldwell-colored hair as there are no sulfates in it.It rinses really clean and has the most awesome scent!Also-a little goes a long way so it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
    <li> I generally used OTC conditioners but I decided to try this brand and it seems to be rather decent.   My GF can&#x27;t get enough of it.      Smells nice and leaves you with soft hair.       Will Purchase Again.  A little goes a long way.... which I like!</li>
    <li> I have long curly red hair, and this product just wasn&#x27;t right for it. This product is not detangling at all, the smell is nauseating/overpowering, and it left my hair feeling like plastic. The \\&quot;shine\\&quot; made my hair look greasy, not healthy and masked my natural highlights. All these complaints might be reflective of this conditioner on my very specific hair type alone, however. I feel it might be better for someone with straight hair with a darker brown or black color. It might not be right for lighter hair colors, and it tended to weigh my hair down while stripping it of moisture.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo so much, but something is wrong with this conditioner! I use so much, and it still doesn&#x27;t help me untangle my hair. For something that is rated so highly, I don&#x27;t understand what I am doing wrong. Plus this is oil based, right? I should make my hair feel softer.    Anyway- I love the shampoo, but I am going to keep looking for the right conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner. I have thick Indian wavy/curly hair and this conditioner made my hair feel super soft and easy to blow dry straight afterwards. After blow drying my hair was still soft.</li>
    <li> Agadir Argan Oil Conditioner plus Shampoo is a great combo and cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to use much. It looks like this bottle will last quite awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping is prompt. Packaging is fine.</li>
    <li> Love it, only thing that takes away the frizzies</li>
    <li> This conditioner is popular, but I feel it not quite helpful, and my hair becomes even drier after using it!</li>
    <li> i found a cure for my hair. i still buy this online. saves me time and money. always on time. i truly love love this product.</li>
    <li> Save your money. Nasty stuff. I used once and gave the rest away. I have yet to find a product better than Regis Olive Oil shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love this products. I have been trying to look for my hair (ethnic hair) and it works great! It feels so soft and smooth afterwards! I use it on my daughter as well, she has mixed hair and it works great on her as well! I highly recommend for black hair mixed hair!! I want to use the oil now!!</li>
    <li> I am loosing my hair like crazy from some time ago. I started using this shampoo and conditioner a couple of weeks ago. The first time, I put a normal amount of shampoo but when I put the conditioner I noticed that my hair did not became soft like it is usual con a conditioner. I combed it while the conditioner was on but it did not detangle my hair. It was very hard to pass the comb. My hair was rough and after loosing a good amount of hair first, because this is a problem that I have and second because the conditioner made me pull the hair more than ever, I got off the shower and let it dry. Once it was dried, I loved the results. My soft curls were defined, my hair was kind of silky, my hair felt it was holding up. Then I added the argadir oil treatment and the hair became silky. O.K. This happened the first time that I washed it. The second time same situation on the shower, but different results when my hair dried. Results became poorer and poorer every time. Today is the fifth time that I washed my hair and after the same experience on the shower now that is dry, my hair looks the worst. It is frizz, no form, no curls,. I had to put 4 times the  amount of argadir oil treatment that I used the firts time. But it just made it soft. It does not help with the frizz, whit the form, with ugly ends. The more that I shower, the more amount oil that I need. Please, somebody give and advice. I don&#x27;t give up yet on this product because I don&#x27;t forget the good results that I got the first time. I thought that maybe my hair will stop falling if I continue using this product, but it seems the opposite. Do you think that I can combine the agadir shampoo, with a different brand conditioner (a normal one) and then the agadir oil (that it really works for softness)?</li>
    <li> Smells great and works nicely on my hair. The bottle isn&#x27;t huge so it&#x27;s not a great deal really but I like the product a lot so I don&#x27;t mind spending a little more. It absorbs into my hair somewhat quickly but not so quickly that I need to use a ridiculous amount of anything.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Keeps my hair healthy and smooth without that oily feeling. My hair hasn&#x27;t felt or looked this good in years! Smells great too!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t remember if I liked it or not so that says a lot. I&#x27;m sure if I did like it I wouldn&#x27;t forget about it</li>
    <li> This smells great yes but honestly this is the worst conditioner i have ever used!! Cheap drugstore is even better than this. I have bleach blonde hair and after using this my hair felt dry, unconditioned ,stringy,and no elasticity feeling. I had once got a free pack at sally&#x27;s of the protein of this and it worked great! thinking this would at be better or at least compare but i am so disappointed! I will stick to Matrix BioLage Hydrating, yes its more but this Is the best over all I have used to bring my hair back to life. SO for anyone new to trying this i would steer clear unless you buy the protein pack that is however great.</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner at RiteAid pharmacy for $20 for a 12 oz. bottle which I thought was expensive at the time.  I see it here on Amazon for much less.  However, I don&#x27;t believe it is effective for my coarse dark color treated hair.  The fragrance is not at all inviting, more like cheap conditioner. It is too thin to do much to your hair.  I still had frizzy hair even after leaving it in for over ten minutes and rinsing it out.  I had to end up using a leave in conditioner to tame the frizzies and make my hair more managable as this product had little of no effect. It was like shampooing without the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner, with a great scent.  The price is unbelievable.  Very expensive if I purchase through the salon I go to.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this conditioner.  It was introduced to me by a co worker and I had little faith in it and could have cared less to try it, but once I did wow!  This is great stuff.  I used to pay a fortune for morracan oil products in my old Miami salon and this blows them out of the water.  I  have naturally curly blonde hair waist length which I can now get stick straight and shiny, not only that people are constantly touching it and complimenting how silky it is, ( never thought that would happen!).  Thanks</li>
    <li> small bottle, not very good. Does not seem to do anything but smell funny and costs way too much for the size, even if it was big it still isn&#x27;t worth it as it doesn&#x27;t work well. I have think long wavy brown hair.</li>
    <li> It sounds better than what it really is. I was lured in by all the descriptions but it just isnt doing anything for my hair.</li>
    <li> I have just ordered my second bottle of the shampoo and conditioner and boy does this work wonders. I have gone through many different conditioners and have not been satified. My hairdresser told me to use Moroccan Oil. I researched the product and found out the most important ingredient was Argan Oil. This conditioner lists it as their fourth one, that&#x27;s good. It is also sulfate free and if you have colored and treated hair sulfates are not good for it. This conditioner makes my hair shiny smooth and silky, I will use no other now. I also use the masque twice a month and the oil and they&#x27;re both awesome also.</li>
    <li> I thought the argan oil does the best job to hydrate the hair . But this product not like i expected. But it still work  its better to leave it on hair for 15 minits after shampoo and cover with cap .</li>
    <li> I love all of Agadir&#x27;s products especially the Argan Oil Spray. I was able to find only 1 bottle of shampoo at target; no conditioner. I decided to try ordering the conditioner on-line. I was able to quickly find the conditioner and the argan oil in dual packs. I was really happy since the dual packs save me money. The conditioner has a light scent; not as heavy as the shampoo. After one shampoo/condition you will notice a difference. I have very long hair; fine with a natural wave. For me personally...I am leaning more and more to the natural based products. I love the smell of this product...a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> I tried this from what I saw online about Argan Oil conditioners, but I have a love-hate feeling with it. It does leave your hair feeling soft IF you don&#x27;t brush it while it&#x27;s in. I brush my hair with conditioner in to get through tangles and have done so all my life. When I run the brush through with the Agadir my hair just feels dry and brittle and does not brush through. I also feel like I have to use a LOT more in my hair to feel the full coverage effect opposed to other brands of conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do not brush your hair with conditioner in (just apply and rinse) than the product works very well. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a pain. I want to like it, but I will not be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> I had recently used several different non-sulfate conditioners but they were not working well at detangling my very, very thick wavy hair or left it feeling greasy. I had to find a new shampoo anyway (see my review for Duffy&#x27;s Brew ESB Craft Beer Shampoo), so I searched for a new conditioner that would keep my tresses detangled without chemicals or weighed-down, greasy feeling.  My search and reading of reviews led me to Agadir Argan Oil Daily Moisturizing Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know that shampoo/conditioner commercial where the lady washes her hair in an airplane and everyone on the plane hears her loud &#x27;ooohhh&#x27; utterances of satisfaction.  Well, when I applied this conditioner and smelled it, that was my response (only one soft &#x27;ooohh&#x27;, though).  I thought, this is what heaven must smell like.  My daughter doesn&#x27;t agree that it&#x27;s THAT great, but so it goes.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, you may not think the scent is THAT great either (I wish it lingered longer!) but it does work very well. It is thick and silky and left my hair soft and smooth but not weighed down or greasy.  I live in Florida, frizz capital of the world, but it has taken care of that issue as well.  I LOVE IT!  I hope it works as well for you as it does for me.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they&#x27;ll make the fragrance into a perfume... ooohhh!  ;-)</li>
    <li> they didnt send me the right conditioner it was the one with blue lable for hair volume the conditioner seems to be very water one n only aragan was a lot better then this made hair even softer i think ill stick with that.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite conditioner (and shampoo). It&#x27;s really expensive in the store but a lot cheaper on amazon. It makes your hair super soft.</li>
    <li> Fantastic moisturizer. Same as hairdresser uses.</li>
    <li> Love the Product, speed of delivery but the cap was not on tight and the conditioner was all over the inside of the box!</li>
    <li> Very pleased to find product for purchase!  Have not been disappointed with any of the Agadir Argan Oil products yet.  All Agadir Argan Oil products are fabulous for dry or damaged hair.  Shipment was prompt and efficient - great customer service follow-up at Amazon.  Great value on price.</li>
    <li> Somehow this stuff is keeping my hair moisturized through this harsh winter. I have really thick hair, dry scalp, and I think this thing is...dare I say it...WORKING?!</li>
    <li> This product gave me an itchy scalp.  No matter how well I rinsed, I ended up with a flaky scalp.  This has never happened to me before.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews for this I was convinced I&#x27;d found what I had been looking for, but alas, it did absolutely NOTHING for my hair.  It looked as frizzy, had no shine, and was as unmanageable as ever.  Apparently it works for a lot of people, though, so it&#x27;s worth a try I suppose.  (Guess my hair is just especially bad!)</li>
    <li> This is awful for my color treated thick curly hair. My shampoo makes my hair softer than this stuff. I love Aragan Oil. Love the smell and the smoothness it offers my hair. This is not what I expected. I got my bottle at Publix for $20 and I expected it to be better than the $0.99 suave conditone... But sadly it&#x27;s not. Maybe it&#x27;s better for thin hair. But I won&#x27;t even use the rest of this bottle.</li>
    <li> product feels watered down, otherwise it might be nice. I have long hair prone to tangles, and it doesn&#x27;t help detangle</li>
    <li> I tried this because it had great reviews and was super cheap as far as conditioner goes. A friend of mine came over and used it before I did- and she left saying &amp;#34;oh, by the way I really love the conditioner in your shower&amp;#34; I will continue using this product :) Leaves hair feeling smooth and looking shiny</li>
    <li> I first saw this conditioner at the hair salon (at twice the price as amazon i might add) where i get my haircut.......had been having a problem with lack of lustre, flaky hair and dry itchy scalp and decided to try it mainly because it has no sulfates (which are probably responsible for half my issues)......i have short hair and gotta say this stuff is concentrated.......you only need like a nickle size amount at the most......the smell is nice (not too strong and not too weak) and after just one use have been hooked.......won&#x27;t ever use anything else......your hair feels soooo smooth that all you want to do is run your fingers through your hair 24/7.......my daughter loves it (and is hooked forever on it now like i am).....in fact she likes it sooo much will come take a shower in my bathroom just so she can use MY conditioner........sent some to each of my sisters (as christmas gifts) and they too are hooked now.......i have been using this now for about 6 months and have to say my hair is quite shiny and soft and i have no more problems with dry itchy scalp!!!  LOVE THIS STUFF!!!!</li>
    <li> A friend gave me a small portion of this conditioner to try on my dry, frizzy, permed hair and I was amazed how quickly my hair started to look shiny and healthy, again.  I purchased both the shampoo and conditioner and am delighted with it.  I&#x27;ve gotten many nice compliments on how good my hair looks.  I use the Agadir products every other day and in between shampoos, I put a tiny bit of the conditioner on my hand, rub my hands together and smooth it through my hair.  It works really well as a &amp;#34;leave in &amp;#34; conditioner to tame any stray frizzes.  I&#x27;m really impressed with this product and find it is well worth the price.  I suspect it will last a long time, as it only takes a dime size amount to condition hair after shampooing.  Great product!</li>
    <li> sinse I have found this product I use nothing else from the shampoo to the conditioners this stuff is really nice</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say whether this condition is conditioning well or not because the fragrance is so strong I rarely want to use it. It&#x27;s a nice smell and i have used pure argan oil is a moisturizer, but the fragrance when in my hair and even after i wash it out is so potent i feel like perfume was sprayed. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again for that reason.</li>
    <li> It gave it a nice feathery texture(my hair is naturally wavy and this stuff seemed to accentuate that), and I use it about once a week. Smells nice too! I used it back when my hair was medium length, where my bangs were down to my nose/lips.</li>
    <li> The combination of argan oil shampoo and the conditioner is absolutely perfect.  After each use my hair feels smooth, fresh; no itching of my scalp.  A small amount is enough for short hair.  I will definately continue using this product and recommend as well.</li>
    <li> I have dry hair and this product actually prevents it from being puffy and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments alone on the smell.</li>
    <li> Hair feels soft and silky!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner, it&#x27;s magic!</li>
    <li> This smells great but I feel it leaves my hair very dry.  It&#x27;s really thick and seems to clean well but it also feels like it&#x27;s stripping my hair of it&#x27;s natural oils and it&#x27;s more brittle then when I began using it a few weeks ago.  I have medium to thick wavy color treated blonde hair.  I don&#x27;t care for this that much...</li>
    <li> very nice smelling, nice on hair, but check for sulfates</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  No need to use a spray conditioner or detangler.  My extra long Hair immediately combs through without  a problem.  Better price when buyer the large bottles.</li>
    <li> Smells very nice, but tends to make my hair a littel oily.  I only use it about 2 times a week.</li>
    <li> Seemed to dry out my hair.</li>
    <li> For years I have searched for a great conditioner to make my dry course hair feel soft and manageable. My stylist recommended Agadir Argan oil, so I was excited to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, every time I used it, the conditioner soaked right into my hair... like I wasn&#x27;t using enough and my hair didn&#x27;t feel soft at all. So I would use much more then normal to get the soft feeling. Once it started feeling soft, I lost that \\&quot;clean fresh out of the shower\\&quot; feeling, as if I had already put product in my hair. I always had trouble finding a good balance. I didn&#x27;t give up after 1 or 2 washes either... I have finished the bottle. The only better then average point is that it smelled decent. A little different than other scents, but nice. Let&#x27;s face it though... most shampoo and conditioners smell good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I wasn&#x27;t going to write a negative review, because everyone&#x27;s hair is different, and obviously this works great for some people. But last week I started using Garnier Fructis Fortifying Conditioner - Triple Nutrition. It&#x27;s for dry damaged hair, and oh my god I am in love!! It was on sale at the grocery store and I&#x27;m so glad I tried it! I now love running my fingers through my hair, and I NEVER thought I&#x27;d never say that! If you want to save time and money, I suggest just going to the store and picking up the Triple Nutrition conditioner and giving it a try first.</li>
    <li> This is a great product i love it</li>
    <li> This did not come even close to being moisturizing enough for my biracial daughter&#x27;s hair. I ended up using the masque made by this company and then using this as a leave in instead of a rinse out. It is not nearly as wonderful as their Argan Oil but it does have the same great mild smell. Probably won&#x27;t buy this again. It doesn&#x27;t really suit our needs. It&#x27;s moisturizing, just not enough.</li>
    <li> This is a nice creamy conditioner with a great, soft fragrance.  I have thin, curly hair.  This conditioner does a good job taming my hair without being heavy, and I use it about every other day.</li>
    <li> This product smells so overpoweringly bad that I can&#x27;t use it; it literally stinks up my entire apartment.  Pity, it did make my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> this has helped in  moisturizing hair and avoiding dry hair look.  I would order this again to help improve hair appearance.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I found this new conditioner, for my daughter and I. I love the texture of it and the smell of it is great! Works well in our hair will recommend this product to all my friends and family!</li>
    <li> average stuff - okay for the price</li>
    <li> It works great for my curly hair.  Very moisturizing and smoothing.  I highly recommend for all types of hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It has a really great smell and leaves my hair soft and full of body. I already ordered another bottle. Make sure you order it here because drug stores charge twice as much.</li>
    <li> I try this product for my hair and it is awesome. My hair looks more shiny and it doesnt frizz anymore like it used to be. I really love this product for my hair and I will recommend this to my friends</li>
    <li> I had damaged hair to a degree in which I bought Agadir&#x27;s masque, their shamppo, and conditioner in order to treat it, and it most definitely worked. You&#x27;ll see positive results after the 1st usage. And continued good results after more usage in which my hair seemed all the way back to standard after using it about 3 to 4 times.</li>
    <li> I started using argan oil on my think curly hair and it does an AMAZING job keeping it soft and shiny. Agadir is my favorite brand. I use this on my daughters hair after her bath to keep it from tangling. The smell is WONDERFUL</li>
    <li> I have tried so many shampoos and none have given me the frizz-free hair I have now.I am a senios citizen who  has her hair  soft and manageable again.</li>
    <li> This smells so good, you just have to use it!</li>
    <li> I love how my hair is feeling more healthier!  I was introduced by my hairdresser, ever since then I love this product!</li>
    <li> I tried many times and still no improvement&lt;br /&gt;my hair is thick but not bad it is normal&lt;br /&gt;after using this it is very baaad on the skin and no result on my thick hair</li>
    <li> I love the Agadir product line....and use the oil, shampoo and conditioner.  My hair shines and stays perfect for days on end.  Color doesn&#x27;t fade either even on the golf course!  I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> I saw this in the local CVS and it&#x27;s about $20 there, but was able to purchase it through Amazon for near half the price (but not including shipping-still it was cheaper through Amazon), though I have to say, if I couldn&#x27;t find it for less than $20 I&#x27;d be sorely tempted to buy it anyway --aw dang it all, yes, I would buy it anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the scent: it&#x27;s strong at first, but not in an unpleasant way, but I become more acclimated to the scent and came to enjoy it more. Reminds me of a softer \\&quot;sweeter\\&quot; incense - exotic and somehow relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need a lot of the shampoo, and my bottle is lasting me quite a while (though I do switch up shampoos occasionally just to keep things interesting), though I always run out of shampoo before the conditioner (I bought both).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair that&#x27;s sometimes prone to oiliness, but this shampoo works well with my  hair type. And when I blow it dry, it&#x27;s soft and shiny and just the hint of scent lingers -- GMR has commented more than once on how nice my hair smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m almost out of the shampoo (I&#x27;m writing this months after I bought the shampoo from Amazon), and will be certainly buying more, and in fact, it is one of my all-time favorite shampoos. When I do switch shampoos I am always happy when it&#x27;s the Agadir&#x27;s turn, and I really can tell the difference between shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friends have said my hair is shiny and healthy, so perhaps this shampoo is part of the reason why. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. I will be posting a review that&#x27;s near the same on the conditioner, since I use both.</li>
    <li> The Agadir Argan Oil Conditioner &amp;#34;awesome&amp;#34; leave the hair so soft and smooth I love this conditioner and the shampoo too. It smell so wonderful. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Love it and smells great. My daughter uses it as well and she is very happy with the results as well.</li>
    <li> Greasy, but smells good. Got it because my after radiation treatment on my head after surgery, my nearby hair was dry and really frizzy. The Argan Oil didn&#x27;t help with the hydration or the awful frizz. Then I tried Wen after seeing it on television and thought I had nothing to lose. I&#x27;ve used Wen sweet almond mint now for two years and it is much better for my hair, and cheaper.</li>
    <li> I like the way this makes my hair feel, smell and how it makes it more manageable, and with it being sulfate free, it&#x27;s a positive in my book.</li>
    <li> Wow!!! This stuff is all around AMAZING! It is sooo gentle on my red color treated hair, smells amazing and cleans well. But unfortunately, I apparently have a sensitive scalp that doesn&#x27;t love the product as much as I do. It made my scalp itch really bad. But I can&#x27;t blame the product for that. So all in all, it is great!</li>
    <li> Agadir Argan Oil Daily Moisturizing Shampoo/conditioner. I really love this stuff. Makes your hair soft, smooth, and smell sooo good.</li>
    <li> Not good for long hair, does not detangle the hair, had to use other conditioners to brush my hair in the shower.</li>
    <li> greatest smell worst results for hair. Scalp itchy and hair unhappy. It may be different for you so give it a try</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and I never have any problems ordering it or receiving it! This will be a repeat item!</li>
    <li> Finally a good shampoo and conditioner that i will stick with. My thick long hair is nice and smooth&lt;br /&gt;The frizz gone!!!!!</li>
    <li> I only tried it once.  It is hard to rate the product at this time.  I have to do a couple of more treatments before I can rate it.</li>
    <li> I was visiting my niece in Australia and she uses it and told me try it. So I did and it did leave hair very soft and silky. My hair has become so coarse with highlights and I have tried everything from Pantene to loreal to you name it. So I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. It makes my hair very soft, even though I damaged it pretty bad. I like this more than I like the Agadir Mask. The scent it really good and lasts for a while.</li>
    <li> I xo this conditioner but am not pleased with the shampoo. This conditioner is very good for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> So I have fine thick straight hair that has recently become dry on the ends. Generally it can get more oily at the roots. This conditioner leaves a residue no matter how many times you rinse. The only reason why I gave it two stars is because, it is weird, sometimes (maybe every 5th time you use it) it does not leave a residue and your hair looks great-smooth and shiny. I have been using this for weeks and at first thought I hadn&#x27;t rinsed well enough, but no matter how much I rinse-it still usually leaves residue. The smell isn&#x27;t great but if the product worked, I would tolerate it.</li>
    <li> Any product that has Argan Oil in it is tops in my book.  The smell is heavenly and people notice.  It moisturizes my hair better than any product I&#x27;ve ever used but doesn&#x27;t make it greasy.  I love the shampoo, conditioner, and oil treatments.  I was wondering if there was a bubble bath?</li>
    <li> I Love this product and def. recommend!, it goes great with using the oil daily to help with frizz and unmanagable hair!</li>
    <li> Having a professional license means I can purchase professional salon products at a discount from salon stores. That being said, I&#x27;ve been pretty loyal to Pureology for a while now. Unfortunately, I ended up in the hospital on bed rest with my 2nd daughter and at the same time ran out of my Pureology shampoo &amp; conditioner. Not being able to go to the salon stores and not wanting to pay double for the same product online, I decided to try this conditioner out as my hair was drying horribly with the hospital water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from being just a little overpowering in the scent department, I am absolutely in love with this conditioner! Even using it daily, I did not find any oily build up and it did not leave my hair limp. I have thin, wavy hair but a lot of it and it goes dry very easy. This has been a life-saver here in the hospital and I&#x27;m definitely going to get both when I&#x27;m out to use for a while. I even sent the set to my grandmother who&#x27;s been having issues with her hair drying out too much and she loves it! Definitely stuck with this now, lol!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay. I haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference in my hair since I first started to use it. in a way it&#x27;s not really worth the cost with the shipping. I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll buy it again. it&#x27;s not really anything that stands out.</li>
    <li> This conditioner gives me about the same results as the shampoo. I don&#x27;t really like that strong perfume smell. No quick results from using it.</li>
    <li> I am not really happy with the results from using this conditioner. My hair feels even more dry after using. I have straight dark hair that has been subject to color and highlights. It just does nothing for my hair. I really wish i could find a product that would make my hair feel soft but this is not it</li>
    <li> I love this brand! I use the shampoo and the oil. This is the first time I have used the conditioner and I probably won&#x27;t get it again. The scent is different, not as good and the product is thin, almost watery. I prefer a thicker conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, and this conditioner does not leave my hair greasy.  I use it with the Agadir Argan Oil Shampoo.</li>
    <li> Before I started using this product, I had very &amp;#34;Hay like&amp;#34; feeling hair.  The very day I used this, it become MUCH better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent it has is really good, and I would recommend this for people with thin, or hay like hair.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice conditioner. It is thinner than other conditioners Ive used but it does the job and smells great!</li>
