      <li>I will know better after I&#x27;m finished with the first bottle.</li>
      <li>Works great keeping the acne at bay and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>But the product is what it says it is &amp; seems to be real and authentic.</li>
      <li>it is great for my adult acne-prone skin and helps keep my skin clear.</li>
      <li>BECAUSE I AM 28 AND STILL HAVE MILD ACNE</li>
      <li>- Mild exfoliation, doesn&#x27;t burn or sting upon application.</li>
      <li>A little drying, but great product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>definitely get a sample of this product at your local Sephora and give it a try - if you like it, buy it on Amazon (definitely a better deal price wise).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not afraid to look in the mirror anymore.</li>
      <li>noticed a difference right away in my skin tone.</li>
      <li>Second time buying this, it works great for white heads, and mild acne.</li>
      <li>While I strongly prefer to use all natural products on my skin, none of them ever worked for me.</li>
      <li>A little pricey, but it&#x27;s really good for your face.</li>
      <li>saw results the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>You get soft and smooth skin.</li>
      <li>Following the regimen closely and now up to a.m. and p.m. use with a moisturizer on top.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for several years now with my dermatologist&#x27;s approval and am quite pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>My esthetician recommended I start using PTR glycolic products and I&#x27;m happy to say that using the cleanser day and night (wash twice at night, first with hands only, second time with Clairsonic Mia), followed by the PTR glycolic 10%  hydrating gel, my skin has been completely clear for over a year!  </li>
      <li>I usually use another brand but heard good things about PTR</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything for YEARS that would help my mild adult acne and large pores/blackheads.  </li>
      <li>my large pores have almost diminished and my skin feels smoother..</li>
      <li>Helps minimize the large pores on my nose.  </li>
      <li>Great product for a low price -  you don&#x27;t see that everyday.  </li>
      <li>Your delivery (this fabulous PTR gel) was in the same box with another order.</li>
      <li>This gel is fabulous -makes pores dissappear and makes us look younger.  </li>
      <li>This really helps with evening out my skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate it all.</li>
      <li>Goes on nicely, in the summer it is actually moisturizing enough where I do not need lotion (but always use SPF).</li>
      <li>My original purchase was with the Thomas Roth Glycolic Acid 3% facial Wash-</li>
      <li>This was supposed to be a 10% glycolic and yet the samples I have from Paula&#x27;s choice that are much less are much more &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; on my face.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>I have real sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny, and a bottle lasts a long time - I use just one pump, once a day after washing my face.</li>
      <li>Only downside - if you stop using it, like i did for a week, your skin quickly returns to it&#x27;s former ways.  </li>
      <li>This seems to help clear up my skin and keep blackheads at bay.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and have had no problems with irritation.</li>
      <li>JUST WONDEROUS RESULTS SO FAR.</li>
      <li>Peter Thomas Roth products have been a complete disaster on my skin.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give you an adequate opinion.</li>
      <li>I am 64 years old, but my twelve grandchildren know I am actually &amp;#34;49 Forever&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>If you have combination skin that is NOT sensitive, and you feel you are too old to have acne anymore</li>

<li> I started with the gel at night, every other night increasing to every night after a week.  </li>
<li> It does sting a bit and probably shouldn&#x27;t be used with other potentially irritating products or near the eyes.</li>
<li> I tried all of the typical creams before figuring out that glycolic acid would work.</li>
<li> Came tightly wrapped.</li>
<li> Usually put this on immediately after washing and before any other lotion.</li>
<li> what a let down!)</li>
<li> Could see a difference after a few nights.</li>
<li> They only made my skin worse.</li>
<li> Waste of money</li>
<li> Although a little bit painful at first, just reduce the amount and frequency.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve bee using this for a little over a month and have seen very little difference.  </li>
<li> I do have normal skin and sometimes tend to get oily in my t-zone and tend to be dry around my chin and base of my nose.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! A little pricey, but it&#x27;s really good for your face. Just don&#x27;t go out in the sun without sunblock.</li>
    <li> I love all of PTR products. I&#x27;m 51. I have real sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using for one year. I&#x27;m not afraid to look in the mirror anymore.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give you an adequate opinion. However, the product seems to last and there is a lot for the money. And it does help my skin look better. I will know better after I&#x27;m finished with the first bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything for YEARS that would help my mild adult acne and large pores/blackheads.  Most creams were too greasy, salicylic products way too drying, and benzoyl peroxide bleached my skin.  Since discovering that glycolic acid really WORKS for me, this is the best product I have found! It leaves your face feeling silky, hydrated and my pores are tight and clear to boot!  If you have combination skin that is NOT sensitive, and you feel you are too old to have acne anymore (who spreads that lie that zits go away with puberty??? what a let down!) definitely get a sample of this product at your local Sephora and give it a try - if you like it, buy it on Amazon (definitely a better deal price wise).  It makes a great base for your makeup and my skin is smoother and clearer than it&#x27;s ever been (and i&#x27;ve only been using it 3 weeks!) Hopefully with a few months of use some of my perpetual blackheads will shrink up and disappear forever! Only downside - if you stop using it, like i did for a week, your skin quickly returns to it&#x27;s former ways.  But LOVE IT now!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my face for about a year and like the results , but i just started putting it on my chest for acne and it&#x27;s the only thing that works! I tried all of the typical creams before figuring out that glycolic acid would work.</li>
    <li> OOPS!  Just now. . . the lost package has been found!  Your delivery (this fabulous PTR gel) was in the same box with another order. I never saw it until now - I cannot be more sorry! Please accept my apologies!  This gel is fabulous -makes pores dissappear and makes us look younger.  Very impressive! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great product for a low price -  you don&#x27;t see that everyday.  Effective results in no time at all.  Very happy with it and will reorder soon.</li>
    <li> I started using glycolics, mostly DDF, after a bad breakout. Since then I&#x27;ve been hooked. My skin is not super sensitive so this never burns. Goes on nicely, in the summer it is actually moisturizing enough where I do not need lotion (but always use SPF). Usually put this on immediately after washing and before any other lotion. It doesn&#x27;t peel off either after applying lotion like other gels. My skin texture is great, prevents breakouts, and does not dry my skin. It&#x27;s is to the point I do not have to use any foundation. I do have normal skin and sometimes tend to get oily in my t-zone and tend to be dry around my chin and base of my nose. This is a must have, been using it daily for two years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bee using this for a little over a month and have seen very little difference.  My original purchase was with the Thomas Roth Glycolic Acid 3% facial Wash- I&#x27;ve been using together and just seen very little difference.  I started with the gel at night, every other night increasing to every night after a week.  The only place that there is some minor discomfort is my forehead.  Some of the darker spots on my face have slightly faded, but not fine lines are any different.  :(  I think my skin may look a tad brighter.</li>
    <li> Helps minimize the large pores on my nose.  I don&#x27;t use it on my entire face, but a bit on my nose at night.  I like this a lot.</li>
    <li> This is one of my fave products to use. It really helps me prevent breakouts and its not too heavy or greasy</li>
    <li> I love it!! I think every women had to use this product one a while</li>
    <li> I love this product and i love that this cost $24 dollars on Amozon if buy these anywhere else it cost $48 a huge savings on Amozon. This exfoliates the skin with out drying it out and it makes your skin look amazing.</li>
    <li> i have used this product for years and i love it. it is great for my adult acne-prone skin and helps keep my skin clear.</li>
    <li> I have only used the glycolic acid 10% hydrating gel for one week and can already notice the difference.  I have some dry spots on my face that in a week are already disappearing.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after two weeks and even longer use. Definitely deserved five stars.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have ordered this in the past, ran out and my skin missed it!  I recommend this product for great skin.</li>
    <li> Total waste of money.  Peter Thomas Roth products have been a complete disaster on my skin.  Save your money for Glytone products.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy again after seeing the news about knock offs on amazon, when it comes to cosmetics!</li>
    <li> They sent me the wrong product, &amp; I wasn&#x27;t able to take it with me on a trip like I planned. But the product is what it says it is &amp; seems to be real and authentic.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that I&#x27;ve found that fixes the flaky skin on my face. It&#x27;s worth every penny, and a bottle lasts a long time - I use just one pump, once a day after washing my face. It&#x27;s made a big difference in both the appearance and texture of my facial skin.</li>
    <li> I am 64 years old, but my twelve grandchildren know I am actually &amp;#34;49 Forever&amp;#34;. I have tried all the products out there and with no apparent difference in my skin tone. I love this product and I saw a difference in my skin within two weeks. I use it faithfully every night and will continue to order it.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  Following the regimen closely and now up to a.m. and p.m. use with a moisturizer on top.  Have seen a decrease in wrinkles and skin discoloration.  I am a convert!</li>
    <li> have used this before.  it makes my pores smaller and evens out texture of my skin.</li>
    <li> I love the Peter Thomas Roth 10% glycolc acid moisturizer lotion.  I use that regularly.  So, a year ago I purchased this thinking that I would like it as a serum.  Nope.  It feels sticky on my face and does not have the \\&quot;working\\&quot; feel that the moisturizer has.  It&#x27;s a pass for me.</li>
    <li> Yet another AMAZING product from Peter Thomas Roth! This really helps with evening out my skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate it all. Great find!</li>
    <li> There is no magic for reducing wrinkling, but sometimes arrest progression and modest improvement from non-surgical means is adequate, if not satisfying. Use this product on bags under eyes and while the bags still exist they are not as deep or puffy.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a year now, the result was OK. I seen a little differences in my skin and my wrinkles slowly faded.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT THIS STUFF AFTER SOME RANDOM BLOG I READ BECAUSE I AM 28 AND STILL HAVE MILD ACNE BUT AM WRINKLING. JUST WONDEROUS RESULTS SO FAR. SMOOTH, MINIMIZED REDNESS, AND MAYBE A PIMPLE HERE AND THERE. I HAVE LITERALLY STOPPED USING MY BENZOYL PEROXIDE ON THE SPOT TREATMENTS. WILL BUY AGAIN WHEN I RUN OUT.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years now with my dermatologist&#x27;s approval and am quite pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> A very good glycolic acid serum. I usually use another brand but heard good things about PTR so I decied to try this product. Very gentle but effective. love the way it leaves your face feeling smooth and helps fade discolorations.</li>
    <li> This was supposed to be a 10% glycolic and yet the samples I have from Paula&#x27;s choice that are much less are much more &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; on my face. at this point.. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> saw results the first time I used it. my face is smoother and my break outs are healing already. definitely will purchase again.</li>
    <li> A little drying, but great product!&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference right away in my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Never tried a Peter Thomas Roth product or an acid hydrating gel before but it is working wonders.  Highly recommend.  I have sensitive skin and have had no problems with irritation.</li>
    <li> I only recently started using this product. I use it every other night, sometimes less frequently because I have sensitive skin. This seems to help clear up my skin and keep blackheads at bay. It does sting a bit and probably shouldn&#x27;t be used with other potentially irritating products or near the eyes.</li>
    <li> Really nice. Could see a difference after a few nights. Came tightly wrapped. I don&#x27;t usually like to buy cosmetics or creams on amazon. Great price</li>
    <li> - Mild exfoliation, doesn&#x27;t burn or sting upon application. You get soft and smooth skin. It does the work. love it.</li>
    <li> Second time buying this, it works great for white heads, and mild acne. Love peter thomas roth this brand, won&#x27;t regret. Although a little bit painful at first, just reduce the amount and frequency.</li>
    <li> I have cystic acne-I know! Isn&#x27;t 60 when we should get a break?! So I&#x27;ve been using Glycolic from PTR for over 25 years. Switched to the hydrating formula in my 50s.  Works great keeping the acne at bay and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Love PTR products!</li>
    <li> I just started using this and it&#x27;s been a miracle worker....my large pores have almost diminished and my skin feels smoother..I&#x27;m waiting to see if it helps with discoloration and acne scars...will keep everyone posted.</li>
    <li> The plastic wrap around the bottle was so difficult to get off that after struggling for a few minutes, the bottle fell out of my hands and broke! Waste of money</li>
    <li> I believe is too soon, I need more time to give a believer opinion</li>
    <li> the worst moustrizer i had ever used</li>
    <li> I struggled with acne for nearly two decades and have spent thousands of dollars on treatments and products. My esthetician recommended I start using PTR glycolic products and I&#x27;m happy to say that using the cleanser day and night (wash twice at night, first with hands only, second time with Clairsonic Mia), followed by the PTR glycolic 10%  hydrating gel, my skin has been completely clear for over a year!  While I strongly prefer to use all natural products on my skin, none of them ever worked for me. They only made my skin worse. I&#x27;m happy I found something that blends the best of science and nature to support oily sensitive acne-prone skin to stay clear.Thank God for this product!</li>
