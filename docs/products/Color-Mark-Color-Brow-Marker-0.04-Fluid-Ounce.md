      <li>And that is the best price.</li>
      <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>works great.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Since I have all the stuff to dye my eyebrows, I was really happy to find something that was way easier.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>But the product doesn&#x27;t always flow out to give a nice neat line and its a bit translucent .</li>
      <li>The color goes on very natural looking and fills any gaps I have in my eyebrows perfectly.</li>
      <li>Easy to use!  </li>
      <li>The point is very fine, as they stated.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I love the color...</li>
      <li>The product is appropriately named as a &amp;#34;marker&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>unless more product.&lt;br /&gt;Mary</li>
      <li>I love how it is so easy to use.</li>
      <li>but it seems easy to use over all its a good product it last for a good amoount of time</li>
      <li>This is a good product price is reasonable have not use it before</li>
      <li>It perfectly colors brows and provides a nice, easy thin line that goes on smoothly and feathers in nicely.</li>
      <li>It does not rub off and is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily, looks natural, and wears/lasts fairly well.  </li>
      <li>I have light brown eyebrows - does anyone else?</li>
      <li>As my original marker is running out, I have reordered the product.</li>
      <li>I still have the one I originally purchased at Ulta months ago...</li>
      <li>On the positive the point is the pointiest I&#x27;ve seen:)</li>
      <li>It really blends with your natural brow for a very nice look.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite go to makeup for my eyebrows.  </li>
      <li>I felt it didn&#x27;t provide a natural look -- more like painted-on brows</li>
      <li>The color is nice but the marker seems a lilttle dry.  </li>
      <li>I first purchased this eyebrow marker in Arizona at an Ulta.</li>
      <li>I bought something similar at Sephora, but I like this better.  </li>
      <li>This really works!</li>
      <li>I recently purchased the TouchBack Brow Marker and I love it.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it ..</li>
      <li>I have used several of the TouchBack products and have been pleased with them.</li>
      <li>The swiping action makes it look more like natural hair lines, even up close.  </li>
      <li>It will last for 18 hours or more, unless you are really sweaty (working out, etc) and then needs to reapplied.  </li>
      <li>just covers grey nicely and natural looking</li>
      <li>not too much.</li>
      <li>THE COLOR COMES OUT WAY TOO FAST TO TRY AND APPLY CORRECTLY.</li>
      <li>This does look a lot like liquid liner, so I was glad that I got the color brown, rather than black.</li>
      <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t run, smudge or flake off during normal use.</li>
      <li>I think it stays in place, but is not hard to remove.  </li>
      <li>The TouchBack BrowMarker is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t make a mess.  </li>
      <li>Quality product that looks quite natural.  </li>
      <li>The natural eyebrows could camouflage the brush marks.  </li>
      <li>I do agree with other reviewers&#x27; opinions that it is better to go a shade lighter than your eyebrow color because it does seem to go on dark.  </li>
      <li>My eyebrows are very sparse, so in my case the brows that I penciled in showed a little to much, for me.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally med-dark blonde hair.  </li>
      <li>This brow marker worked well at first, but after using it a handful of times, it seems to not dispense the liquid unless you hold it tip down.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m back to my old Eyebrow powder with the little brush.</li>
<li> I get the feeling that it won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
<li> I really have to press hard to use.  </li>
<li> I would consider going lighter if you have grey in your brows.  </li>
<li> My main complaint of the powdered eye brow product was that when I applied it - there would be excess product fall on the area below my eyes.  </li>
<li> The brow maarker was dried up when I received it, and didn&#x27;t work properly.  </li>
<li> I have some grey in my eyebrows and it looks really dark when I fill them in.  </li>
<li> the other thing is application...</li>
<li> Such a small amount.. Don&#x27;t know if i will buy again.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a bit dark, but I like that.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not too dark.  </li>
<li> So - I wrote down the name and located the product on Amazon.  </li>
<li> Previously, I used a powdered eyebrow product.  </li>
<li> , color was strange according to her, too reddish and it was like a marker, hard to wash off.</li>
<li> Medium brown was very dark.</li>
<li> Just one past of the brush on your eyebrows and it fills in the sparse brows.  </li>
<li> Hard to find anything in this shade that doesn&#x27;t come off in 15 minutes.</li>
<li> I have not experienced any clumping or uneven application.  </li>
<li> ; WHICH, I THOUGHT, WAS WAY TOO THICK.</li>

    <li> The product is appropriately named as a &amp;#34;marker&amp;#34;.  I felt it didn&#x27;t provide a natural look -- more like painted-on brows</li>
    <li> I THOUGHT THE BROWMARKERS WERE ALL THE SAME, BUT THIS ONE WAS NOT. THE COLOR COMES OUT WAY TOO FAST TO TRY AND APPLY CORRECTLY. AND I DID NOT LIKE THE TIP OF THE PEN; WHICH, I THOUGHT, WAS WAY TOO THICK. WILL NOT PURCHASE THIS, AGAIN.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite go to makeup for my eyebrows.  The color goes on very natural looking and fills any gaps I have in my eyebrows perfectly.</li>
    <li> wish it would last longer though. Such a small amount.. Don&#x27;t know if i will buy again. unless more product.&lt;br /&gt;Mary</li>
    <li> I have used several of the TouchBack products and have been pleased with them. I recently purchased the TouchBack Brow Marker and I love it. Just one past of the brush on your eyebrows and it fills in the sparse brows.  And it stays on all day. I love it!</li>
    <li> This brow marker worked well at first, but after using it a handful of times, it seems to not dispense the liquid unless you hold it tip down. Try applying this to your eyebrows that way, just imagine it!  I had ordered two of these and wish I had tried out one before.  Oh well! I&#x27;m back to my old Eyebrow powder with the little brush.</li>
    <li> I have naturally med-dark blonde hair.  I first purchased this eyebrow marker in Arizona at an Ulta. Since I have all the stuff to dye my eyebrows, I was really happy to find something that was way easier. It will last for 18 hours or more, unless you are really sweaty (working out, etc) and then needs to reapplied.  However, it doesn&#x27;t run, smudge or flake off during normal use. There are a lot of mixed reviews and I wonder it is a quality control thing... I still have the one I originally purchased at Ulta months ago... so when it quits, I will open this one purchased through Amazon.  I will update if there are any issues.  Honestly, I love the color... it&#x27;s a bit dark, but I like that.  It&#x27;s not too dark.  the other thing is application... you literally swipe it on... in hair motions... not a &amp;#34;drawing&amp;#34; motion or it will look like a painted on line.  The swiping action makes it look more like natural hair lines, even up close.  Like I said, if I have any issues with this one, I will update my review!</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom but she did not like it, color was strange according to her, too reddish and it was like a marker, hard to wash off.</li>
    <li> The item arrived as described.  The point is very fine, as they stated.  My eyebrows are very sparse, so in my case the brows that I penciled in showed a little to much, for me.  This product could be used for someone with 50% loss of eyebrow.  The natural eyebrows could camouflage the brush marks.  On the positive the point is the pointiest I&#x27;ve seen:)</li>
    <li> This really works! It perfectly colors brows and provides a nice, easy thin line that goes on smoothly and feathers in nicely. I would get this again. Great product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product once before. I love how it is so easy to use. And that is the best price. No shipping charges either .</li>
    <li> works great. not too much. just covers grey nicely and natural looking</li>
    <li> The first time I used it .. It was everything I&#x27;d hoped for .. But the product doesn&#x27;t always flow out to give a nice neat line and its a bit translucent . I&#x27;m hoping this product is improved when the mfg. gets feedback from customers because this IS what I need.</li>
    <li> This is a good product price is reasonable have not use it before but it seems easy to use over all its a good product it last for a good amoount of time</li>
    <li> The brow maarker was dried up when I received it, and didn&#x27;t work properly.  I would never buy it again.</li>
    <li> Easy to use!  Quality product that looks quite natural.  I bought something similar at Sephora, but I like this better.  It really blends with your natural brow for a very nice look.</li>
    <li> estoy decepcionada con uds. me robaron. compre producto. browmarker touckback.  medium brown.Para cejas, mas caro. y me enviaron otro q no tiene nada que ver con lo que pedi. me enviaron producto para el cabello, mas barato. unos ladrones. jamas les vuelvo a comprar. escribo desde venezuela</li>
    <li> The color is nice but the marker seems a lilttle dry.  I really have to press hard to use.  I get the feeling that it won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> I saw this product featured on one of the morning t.v. shows.  So - I wrote down the name and located the product on Amazon.  Previously, I used a powdered eyebrow product.  My main complaint of the powdered eye brow product was that when I applied it - there would be excess product fall on the area below my eyes.  The TouchBack BrowMarker is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t make a mess.  I do agree with other reviewers&#x27; opinions that it is better to go a shade lighter than your eyebrow color because it does seem to go on dark.  I have not experienced any clumping or uneven application.  I think it stays in place, but is not hard to remove.  I would definitely order it again!</li>
    <li> This does look a lot like liquid liner, so I was glad that I got the color brown, rather than black.</li>
    <li> blonde was invisible. Medium brown was very dark. I have light brown eyebrows - does anyone else? Hard to find anything in this shade that doesn&#x27;t come off in 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> I saw a recommendation for this product written by a columnist in my local newspaper, so I decided to try it.  It goes on easily, looks natural, and wears/lasts fairly well.  As my original marker is running out, I have reordered the product.</li>
    <li> I like product and would not hesitate to recommend to others.  It does not rub off and is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I have some grey in my eyebrows and it looks really dark when I fill them in.  I would consider going lighter if you have grey in your brows.  Otherwise it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
