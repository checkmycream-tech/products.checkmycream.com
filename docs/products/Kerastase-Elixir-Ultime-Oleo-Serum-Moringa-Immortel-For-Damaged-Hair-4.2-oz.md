      <li>When I received my product from Amazon, I opened it right away and compared it to the little I had left in my other bottle (not purchased from Amazon), and sure enough, the one from Amazon was runnier and smelled as though it had been diluted with baby oil.  </li>
      <li>does it smell familiar and not the usual Kerastase elixir Oleo</li>
      <li>The other reviews were positive, so I decided to go ahead and order it.  </li>
      <li>If you have thin fine hair I would avoid the roots.</li>

    <li> all Kerastase products are the best, all the sets all Elixir are great, this one in special is very nutritive, is you have another kind of hair you will find the apropiate for you. Trust me it worth it</li>
    <li> I love Kerastase products so I was excited to try this version of the hair oil. This is by far my most favorite product. It goes on very light and smells amazing. IT does not weigh my hair down but takes care of the split ends. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Second life for dry hairs. Perfect moisturizing, but not as perfect for making hair straight.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair product! I&#x27;ve used this from about 2 years ago when my sister worked at Kerastase back home and she would get discounts for products. This luxurious oil softens, shines, conditions without the grease. My wavy, slightly coarse asian hair feels smoother without feeling weighed down by product. I absolutely love it, no matter what the season or weather. This one from the Amazon seller seems legit. Smells the same and has met my expectations.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very useful for my damaged and weak hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months, but it is quite pricey.  My bottle was almost empty, so I decided to check it out on Amazon.  When I read the reviews about this product, there was one review that claimed it was a fake.  The other reviews were positive, so I decided to go ahead and order it.  When I received my product from Amazon, I opened it right away and compared it to the little I had left in my other bottle (not purchased from Amazon), and sure enough, the one from Amazon was runnier and smelled as though it had been diluted with baby oil.  I&#x27;m returning it for a refund.  I&#x27;m usually very happy with my products I get from Amazon, but not this time.  :(</li>
    <li> My hair is long, fine, and color treated.  I have used this product for about six months and my hair just keeps getting stronger.  I receive compliments on the way my hair looks and feels.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Very good product for naturally frizzy or dry, chemically damaged hair. Helps to tame and smooth uncontrollable, frizzy hair. Price is much lower than salon costs. Please continue to carry high end salon products at low costs. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I had been looking for something to put on my dry Colorado curls—This product is fantastic and it smells awesome.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Super thin. Not thick like others that make your hair feel greasy. I have super baby angel fine hair and dyed it bleach blonde and this works a dream on my hair weather it&#x27;s straight , curly, or super dry and bridle looking.  It does the trick.</li>
    <li> One of the best serums I have used;makes hair soft,silky,shiny and not oily or greasy.Does not weigh hair down.This serum will last a long time.I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years now and absolutely love it.  I have very long hair and insist it be healthy from the roots to the ends.  This product helps with keeping it healthy, shinny and soft to the touch. You only need one pump for my length hair so not as much for shorter length hair. And if you use a flat iron on your hair this is a nice product to put on after you have put the iron to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price for this product on Amazon is a good price.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is awesome stuff!  It truly transforms your hair to awesome silkiness!!!  It removes all the frizz.  I straighten it right after I apply it!!  I love it!!!  It&#x27;s worth the money!!</li>
    <li> I used it a couple of times but went back to an Oil by Lanza I like it better. This one did not do much for me.</li>
    <li> Very good product, worth it! Best buy worth the price, will order again next time.satisfied and worth the money! Tnx</li>
    <li> Great for smoothing out hair</li>
    <li> the product is baby oil, is not genuine</li>
    <li> The smell is a little floral like, but it feels great.</li>
    <li> Super fast shippin. Item as described.</li>
    <li> I used it on my hair to repair dry and brittle ends. It has made a noticble difference. I have used this vendor before. Always reliable!</li>
    <li> Very good for a pick-me-up when hair is dry, unhealthy looking. I&#x27;ve got this and the pink, Ultime formula and I feel like the pink works better. They both smell amazing too, which is a plus.</li>
    <li> I was excited to find these on amazon and received the product already leaking everywhere.  I smelled the oil and boy does it smell familiar and not the usual Kerastase elixir Oleo I know.  I went to my daughters bathroom and compared both oil and what do you know, someone put Johnson&#x27;s baby oil in this tampered bottle and sold to me!  Really irritated and angry about the quality control.  Amazon, do not trust that seller who sold this to me.  You have the records, investigate!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Works well on all hair types but great for dry, damaged hair. Improvement in brittle hair within days.</li>
    <li> I use on the whole extension of the hair, after having my hair washed as a leave in and also again at the ends before washing the hair.</li>
    <li> Not good I didn&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> For an elixir made for damaged hair it isn&#x27;t very thick.  I would recommend sticking to the Kerastase Elixir Ultime.</li>
    <li> Love this brand great product</li>
    <li> Smells like baby oil, which isn&#x27;t bad. I use it almost every day and little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> leave my hair soft and silky. price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Received a fake. Definitely baby oil based on the smell and consistency. Wrapped in cellophane after tampering to make it look unopened.  Not the usual shrinkwrap.</li>
    <li> Long, fine, color-treated hair. Stated using this and have had actual compliments on the texture of my hair. They have several choices based on your hair type and needs. Pick the correct one and it is worth the ,obey.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, very fast delivery!</li>
    <li> An overly processed hair color appointment led me to this product.  Use from dry hair to tips.  If you have thin fine hair I would avoid the roots. Works great, leaves hair feeling silky smooth</li>
