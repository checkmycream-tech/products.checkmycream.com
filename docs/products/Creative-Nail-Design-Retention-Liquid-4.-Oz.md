    <li> I used it once to try to do my nails but the scent is too strong and i don&#x27;t like it all.</li>
    <li> Smells horrible, I bought it as a gift but I could smell it through the bubble wrap and the envelope that was lined in bubble wrap. My sister-in-law didn&#x27;t care for the smell either, although she decided to keep it, even though she got a headache every time she used it. I guess it works, though, not sure I could get past the smell, myself.</li>
    <li> Love this! The best liquid retention I ever used!</li>
    <li> I received the monomer a day before it said it would be here :). I had a small problem with the product but the sellers were so sweet to fix it for me! Monomer works amazing!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!!! My nails don&#x27;t lift and they last a really long time. A month and half to two months. I&#x27;ve bought this product twice and will continue to keep buying it. So don&#x27;t stop selling it please😃</li>
    <li> I use this with the CND clear powder and get a perfect manicure every time.  Been doing my own acrylics for 25 years now and find CND to be the best liquid and powder.  No lifting, yellowing, cracking.  Has a perfect setting time and easy to work with.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my nail salon lady. She said it was the best and I can&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. It works great just like a good quality product should. It makes work easier to get done and my clients love it as well</li>
    <li> great product such a small bottle can fit in palm but lasts for two months when i do my nails every other week</li>
    <li> Finally something that works! I have been doing acrylic over my natural nails for 15 years, nothing is more aggravating then doing you nails and having them lift the next day. As a stay at home mom of 3 I do not have time or money to go to the salon to get them done and didn&#x27;t think I could buy a salon quality product without a licence. Well I was wrong! When I did my nails for the first time I didn&#x27;t get my hopes up but boy am I impressed. I did my nails over a week ago and have not had one nail lift, crack or split. I am so happy with this product and will never use anything else, so please do not stop selling it. THANK YOU!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this with the cnd powder. They work well together</li>
    <li> this product really works for my nails job, my clients are very happy with the change because this one help to retain more the acrlylic to the natural nail</li>
    <li> This Retention+ liquid requires the retention+ powder. Outstanding product when used as directed. Love it!! Cant go wrong with any CND products. Highly recommended. 5++</li>
    <li> My nails are lasting weeks.&lt;br /&gt; More words required. More words required. More words required. More words required. More words required.</li>
    <li> Super potent chemical smell. But that&#x27;s obvious for the career or hobby you are into. Works fantastic!  I love how my nails come out!</li>
    <li> The picture does no justice on how extremely tiny this container is. Definity not worth that much money.</li>
    <li> CND Retention is a wonderful product, it&#x27;s all I use. My customers like it....Yes, it&#x27;s high priced, but it is worth it.</li>
