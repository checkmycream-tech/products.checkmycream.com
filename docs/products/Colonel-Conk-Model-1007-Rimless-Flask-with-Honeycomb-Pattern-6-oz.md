      <li>Great quality product and the price is right!</li>
      <li>Great flask overall: good build, great price, has never leaked in my pocket.  </li>
      <li>I was searching for a good quality hip flask not so expansive, this one is probably the best price/quality on the net.</li>
      <li>Honeycomb design is awesome, looks very classy.  </li>
      <li>The threads on the lid and spout are well made, making it very easy to screw and unscrew the cap.</li>
      <li>I really like the looks and has a very good build quality.</li>
      <li>I leave mine in the glovebox of my truck most of the time and through repeated heat/cold exposure still looks brand new and the seal works perfectly.</li>

      <li>Nice strong seal.</li>
      <li>Smart looking with a great no loss cap.</li>
      <li>The hardship of listening to a rabbi drone on may be enjoyed with inebriated aplomb.</li>
      <li>The product is nice and is surely better than most flasks out there; it is very sturdy and extremely good looking.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a whisky collector and very recently, I&#x27;ve suddenly found myself a bit of a flask collector as well, in my search for the perfect flask.</li>
      <li>But is otherwise quite lovely.</li>
      <li>I have not had many chances to use it yet but the quality seems great.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Would have made it a much better purchase.</li>
      <li>6 oz fits in back pocket perfectly or inside suit pocket.  </li>
      <li>Sturdy and elegant.  </li>
      <li>But at the end of the day it gets the job done, especially at work 6oz is the perfect size.</li>
      <li>A well constructed flask, that generously holds more &amp;#34;elixir&amp;#34; than most flasks, with what feels like a quality honeycomb engraved pattern.</li>
      <li>Certainly, my top priority is build quality and this flask gets top marks.</li>
      <li>is the perfect amount for a daily flask.</li>
      <li>The top is snug and does not leak when laying on its side</li>
      <li>For the price, it&#x27;s phenomenal.</li>
      <li>I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re apparently a favorite wedding party gift to groomsmen, and cheapskate grooms can buy them in dozen lots for practically nothing.</li>
      <li>I love the design and that it can be engraved.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this flask.</li>
      <li>I have never written an amazon review until now because I have always been satisfied with my purchases.  </li>
      <li>Gotta love the honeycomb pattern.</li>
      <li>flask was beautifully made of highly polished and weighty stainless steel, configured with a handsomely embossed honeycomb pattern that catches the eye and feels good to the hand.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it will serve me very well for a good while.</li>
      <li>Plus I think it&#x27;s kind of fun to refer to it as \\&quot;The Colonel.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Very sturdy construction, the hinge is on good and none of the parts feel flimsy.  </li>
      <li>Build quality not bad, but the threads on the cap are rusty!  </li>
      <li>Easy to clean, easy to hold and easy to pass around with friends :)</li>
      <li>Then there&#x27;s the best feature of all, the dead sexy honeycomb pattern adorning the outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>From the super-high-end Dovo straight razors to this exquisite flask, it&#x27;s obvious that Colonel Ichabod Conk and the good folks running his New Mexico outlet are not messing around!</li>
      <li>All the parts appear to be stainless, or if the cap and hinge are just chromed, it is much better quality than the Conk!  </li>
      <li>The Chinese factories are happy to turn them out by the zillions, but if you diligently read Amazon product reviews as I do, you quickly realize you mostly get what you pay</li>
      <li>if you need a flask to carry around with you, for bars, the night out, dates, camping, hunting, etc., manly things, then be a man till it up with your beverage of choice, and this fits perfectly in the back pocket, without being seen, and can save one money in a bar if you are smart.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t affect the taste of your drink like some cheap flasks</li>
      <li>/&gt;The look and feel is smooth and classy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have to have water always available when I go out, because&lt;br /&gt;of</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>The honeycomb pattern looks classy and makes a good looking gift.</li>
      <li>The pattern is eye catching without being gaudy, the construction is outstanding; it is in fact built like a European auto.</li>
      <li>For those of you who attend High Holiday services I present the ideal solution to interminable prayers and sermons.</li>
      <li>Simple, looks good, Functional</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> First ever flask. I really like the looks and has a very good build quality. Left alcohol in it for about 5 days with no noticeable change in taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can bring my drink around.</li>
    <li> The liquid didn&#x27;t get a metallic taste and I was very happy about that. It did start to leak though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars for no metallic taste&lt;br /&gt;3 stars for leaking a little bit</li>
    <li> Very classy flask. The lid does not leak and the pattern is attractive. If used to hold whiskey, 5 stars.. Anything else? 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this flask. I purchased it as a gift and if they don&#x27;t like it, I will sure keep it! As other reviewers have said, it is very sturdy and well-made. I love the honeycomb design which is on the front AND the back of the flask. I see that some people did not receive a flask with the small box for engraving. For the record, mine DID come with that box (although I would have preferred one without it) but it is great. I can&#x27;t say enough about this flask for such a great price. It comes in a box that is perfect for wrapping. I can&#x27;t wait to see if he likes it. I would recommend this to anyone thinking about purchasing.</li>
    <li> All around awesome !! Boyfriend loved it and really enjoyed the look and feel of the honey comb design !!! Only down side , did not come with a funnel !! :(</li>
    <li> NOT cheap. I repeat, NOT cheaply made. Nice strong seal. Nice smooth threads for the cap and the honeycomb design is simple yet modern looking. I leave mine in the glovebox of my truck most of the time and through repeated heat/cold exposure still looks brand new and the seal works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve left whiskey, rum, and gin in this flask for days (perhaps weeks) without any metallic taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The look and feel is smooth and classy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I would suggest is that you should get something inscribed on the little blank square in the lower right-hand corner. It looks odd blank.</li>
    <li> Beauty and Quality pretty much sums up my impression of this flask. I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. It is gorgeous to look at plus it has that feel of quality which means a lot to me. Spend the extra few bucks and get something that will last and that you will be proud of.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a whisky collector and very recently, I&#x27;ve suddenly found myself a bit of a flask collector as well, in my search for the perfect flask. Certainly, my top priority is build quality and this flask gets top marks. Put it next to the standard Chinese-made stainless steel flask you can find anywhere and you&#x27;ll immediately see the difference. Even the weight is a dead giveaway. Look inside the lip and you&#x27;ll see machining marks from the lathe that formed it from a solid billet. No other flask I&#x27;ve held even approaches this level of quality. That piece alone reeks of surgical precision. Even the screw top is on another level entirely. Then there&#x27;s the best feature of all, the dead sexy honeycomb pattern adorning the outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my daily flask. I have a Glenlivet 8 oz. flask that gets some use if I&#x27;m traveling with a companion or if I expect to be away for a bit longer than usual but I feel 6 oz. is the perfect amount for a daily flask. I think my search is finally over. I certainly won&#x27;t turn down any that might come my way but I think I&#x27;ve found the perfect flask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given the Col. Conk website a once-over and it&#x27;s apparent that they only sell rock solid products. From the super-high-end Dovo straight razors to this exquisite flask, it&#x27;s obvious that Colonel Ichabod Conk and the good folks running his New Mexico outlet are not messing around!</li>
    <li> The product is nice and is surely better than most flasks out there; it is very sturdy and extremely good looking. I&#x27;m sure it will serve me very well for a good while. That said, however, I do have two cons I&#x27;d like to mention: 1) the cap keeper is plastic, which isn&#x27;t to say that it isn&#x27;t functional, it&#x27;s just sort of one of those depressing facts; 2) There are noticeable, however, subtle weld lines/seams on the top and bottom rims of the flask. I can&#x27;t imagine it leaking anytime soon, but for three times the price of some other decent flasks, I was expecting a little more. They are only visible upon very close inspection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars. I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
    <li> The build quality on this flask is as excellent as others have noted. Don&#x27;t buy a cheaper flask that leaks or gives a bad flavor. Do rinse well with soap and water before first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine did not come with a blank area for engraving; the pattern was across the whole face.  I prefer that anyway so I won&#x27;t deduct a star from my rating.</li>
    <li> Great quality product and the price is right! Has an area you could have engraved too if you wanted to. Christmas gift for my husband and he was very happy!</li>
    <li> First flask I even bought and I am very impressed- would buy again.</li>
    <li> The flask looks real unique and flashy. People always ask me where I found it. Fits in my back pant pocket well.</li>
    <li> This flask always stands out (maybe that&#x27;s a bad thing) for its handsome appearance. The honeycomb pattern is really crisp, unlike anything I have seen on other flasks, especially at this price point. As other reviewers have mentioned, the blank spot intended for initials can look a bit odd if left empty. That makes it great for a personalized gift.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a superior product. The honeycomb pattern adds a nice bit of texture and grip to the flask without being gaudy and unpleasant. The lid and arm both made of stainless steel. The threads on the lid and spout are well made, making it very easy to screw and unscrew the cap. I bought this as a gift to my boyfriend from his &amp;#34;honey&amp;#34; and he loved it.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. It&#x27;s stainless, including the cap and the thingy that keeps it in place.</li>
    <li> Leaves a bad taste in whiskey if left in longer than a few hours. But is otherwise quite lovely.</li>
    <li> I have to have water always available when I go out, because&lt;br /&gt;of medications I take.  I had a small plastic bottle somehow spill&lt;br /&gt;water and soak the inside of my purse.  I carry my flask with water&lt;br /&gt;and no longer worry about spills.  The 6oz. size is perfect.</li>
    <li> This flask is built for class!  Sturdy and elegant.  But at the end of the day it gets the job done, especially at work 6oz is the perfect size. People ask me about it all the time!</li>
    <li> A well constructed flask, that generously holds more &amp;#34;elixir&amp;#34; than most flasks, with what feels like a quality honeycomb engraved pattern. I nice touch - the spot of the flask in the corner awaiting my initials!</li>
    <li> Truly a good product. No BS here… Doesn&#x27;t leave a taste, holds its finish well, etc. I recommend buying a funnel.</li>
    <li> Every single aspect about this flask is quality, every thing.  The outside texture looks and feels great and the lid screws on smooth and tight.</li>
    <li> I wanted a couple of flasks to carry a little variety of booze on camping trips, and on overnights on the boat.  I got some of the larger similar-appearing ones (rated 12 ounces) but these were cheesy and thin.  This is really nice, heavy stainless, good cap, etc.  This is the one to get.</li>
    <li> Good size, does not leak. It holds about the equivalent of 6 to 7 small shots so if you want more I&#x27;d suggest you go with the 8 or 9oz.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I have not had many chances to use it yet but the quality seems great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap seems to seal tight. I hope that lasts.</li>
    <li> Got this and have used it several times.  Very sturdy construction, the hinge is on good and none of the parts feel flimsy.  The honey comb design is a nice touch, and has a place on the front for engraving initials if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing.  Doesn&#x27;t affect the taste of your drink like some cheap flasks can, all in all a great flask to have.</li>
    <li> 6 oz fits in back pocket perfectly or inside suit pocket.  No leaks single malt scotch taste great looks great.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a good quality hip flask not so expansive, this one is probably the best price/quality on the net.</li>
    <li> The flask has a nice finish, not too heavy nor too light. Just the right size and weight for me.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift for my husband and he loved it. Its great that the hinge is attached securely to the lid. I love the design and that it can be engraved. The only thing you should know before purchase is that is has a shiny mirrored finish that shows fingerprints/smudges easily. If you are someone who would be bothered by that, then I would look for one with a different finish.</li>
    <li> For those of you who attend High Holiday services I present the ideal solution to interminable prayers and sermons. The hardship of listening to a rabbi drone on may be enjoyed with inebriated aplomb. God fearing people have finally never had it so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discrete, classy, yet large enough to hold plenty of the beverage of your choice; I can assure you that you will be the envy of the people on your bench. Be warned, overindulgence is not recommended. I&#x27;ve heard that running through the synagogue with no pants on is frowned upon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy New Year!</li>
    <li> Amazon is great for stuff like this. If you know exactly how big a standard flask is (usually 6oz) then you&#x27;re getting exactly what you&#x27;re expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this product was actually very nice. Engraved honeycomb pattern is stylish and different. High quality and heavy stainless steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have liked if it came with a funnel or something. Would have made it a much better purchase.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Colonel Conk Sunstar Model 1007 Rimless Flask with Honeycomb Pattern&amp;#34; gets the job down when in need of a flask.</li>
    <li> Great, sturdy container. Smart looking with a great no loss cap. Rinse it out and fill it up--then go.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon provided quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Great flask. Good design. The lid screws down nice and snug. Gotta love the honeycomb pattern. Fits in my back pocket nicely.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice looking flask.  It carries my alcohol nicely.  The only thing is that if you don&#x27;t lock it down extra tight it&#x27;s a little leaky.  That can be a real PITA if it&#x27;s in your pocket.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Kept me anything but dry at the ND Michigan game this year.</li>
    <li> When I got this flask, I washed it thoroughly. I&#x27;ve then filled this up with scotch and left it for a week. After leaving it alone for as long as I could bear to, I took a swig and was very pleased to discover that my scotch still tasted all scotchy and delicious and there was no metallic taste at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The construction of the flask is solid, without being too heavy. The metal is nicely embossed with a beehive pattern and then polished well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this for the price - it&#x27;s definitely not a cheap and flimsy tin can.</li>
    <li> Small enough to fit in my back jeans pocket, yet large enough to get the job done.  The honeycomb pattern not only looks cool, but it also aids my grip.  Plus I think it&#x27;s kind of fun to refer to it as \\&quot;The Colonel.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried various flasks and this one combines good looks and quality of construction.  I&#x27;ve carried it in both bags and pockets and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.  It feels a little heftier and better built than the plain flasks I&#x27;ve bought in the past.  The cap seals up nice and tight.  The honeycomb pattern looks classy and makes a good looking gift.</li>
    <li> Simple, looks good, Functional</li>
    <li> I like it for the price. No metallic taste and feels like it will last for a few years. The honeycomb pattern is a nice touch.</li>
    <li> Great flask overall: good build, great price, has never leaked in my pocket.  Honeycomb design is awesome, looks very classy.  Definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> Nice flask overall but they didn&#x27;t crimp the hinge enough so there is a rattle even when the cap is tight.  This same issue causes the arm and cap to whack you when tilting the flask up to drink as it is very loose.</li>
    <li> this was a good idea to own. it is a very good quality. it kept the drink tasting fresh and NO steel flavor.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price.  Nice heavy weight.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before purchasing this product and they were accurate; this flask is excellently build! The pattern is eye catching without being gaudy, the construction is outstanding; it is in fact built like a European auto.</li>
    <li> I needed a flask because I travel a lot and this one fits the bill, perfectly. Its good-looking, functional and does not leak!!!</li>
    <li> For my boyfriend. He was thoroughly impressed with the honeycomb design and was ecstatic when he saw the spot for optional engraving. He&#x27;s used it several times since I gifted it to him in November. The top is snug and does not leak when laying on its side (something my roommate&#x27;s flask does all the time) and it&#x27;s very hard to smudge. Overall a clean, sleek and unique flask that holds liquor nicely. Easy to clean, easy to hold and easy to pass around with friends :)</li>
    <li> Been using this for scotch for a few weeks now and it&#x27;s really great. For the price, it&#x27;s phenomenal. I&#x27;ve put some relatively expensive scotches in here with no worry about affecting the flavor. The lid seals tight and I can throw it in a backpack and not worry about spilling.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband for Christmas and we used it to sneak some bourbon into a concert shortly after. (Shhhh... don&#x27;t tell!) It holds a lot more than I expected and I may have gotten a little carried away pouring it into our large fountain Coke... but we had an awesome time at the concert! ;)</li>
    <li> I have never written an amazon review until now because I have always been satisfied with my purchases.  The flask arrived today and is not as pictured.  There is no area for an engraving to be etched into this flask.  The honeycomb pattern goes throughout the flask and that is unacceptable given that this was supposed to be a gift for my best friend.  Misleading description.</li>
    <li> if you need a flask to carry around with you, for bars, the night out, dates, camping, hunting, etc., manly things, then be a man till it up with your beverage of choice, and this fits perfectly in the back pocket, without being seen, and can save one money in a bar if you are smart. Of course be small with it, drink in moderation, and never drink and drive. This flask is the best I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
    <li> Build quality not bad, but the threads on the cap are rusty!  The flask is stainless steel, but the cap and hinge appear to just be chromed over another type of metal?  The gasket under the cap is like what you see under a typical plastic mouthwash bottle, not likely to last very long without leaking!  Also, the 6 ounce size was a little larger than I expected, not exactly great for smuggling.  I also purchased the Zippo 3 ounce flask.  Excellent build quality and size is perfect!  Even the gasket under the cap on the zippo is rubber and should last quite some time.  All the parts appear to be stainless, or if the cap and hinge are just chromed, it is much better quality than the Conk!  If the 3 ounce size works for you I would get the Zippo.  Even if you had to buy two Zippos.  The price is also great on the Zippo!</li>
    <li> This flask is very nice looking with no leaks. Some of the other cheaper ones I have leaked and I had to repair them myself.</li>
    <li> After prowling through all the online offerings of pocketable hip flasks, I realized that there was lots of junk out there. They&#x27;re apparently a favorite wedding party gift to groomsmen, and cheapskate grooms can buy them in dozen lots for practically nothing. The Chinese factories are happy to turn them out by the zillions, but if you diligently read Amazon product reviews as I do, you quickly realize you mostly get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was ready to end my quest when I found this nifty stainless steel flask from Colonel Conk. The Colonel does a nice job. This 6 oz. flask was beautifully made of highly polished and weighty stainless steel, configured with a handsomely embossed honeycomb pattern that catches the eye and feels good to the hand. Unlike some, it seals tightly and leaks nary a drop. If I had anything to fuss about at all, it would be that the filler neck is a bit narrow, so it would be handy to have a small funnel to fill it. It is also hard to tell how full you are getting it. I overdid it of course and a lot of expensive Maker&#x27;s Mark gushed out on the counter top. I felt that licking it off the counter top was just as bad form as chewing it out of the drenched paper towel I used to wipe it up, so I&#x27;ll just warn you to fill with restraint. This is actually a classy flask and you will probably want to live up to its elegant style and flair. Best yet, it was surprisingly reasonable for this level of quality.</li>
    <li> Like other purchasers, I&#x27;m impressed by the build quality here in comparison to other flasks. It feels substantial in the hand, with the honeycomb etching providing just a bit of tactile friction. The size is ideal for front or back pockets, and, happily, the retaining arm has a bit of a detente when flipped out, such that it won&#x27;t swing back and smack you in the face unexpectedly during a pull. Item features the advertised honeycomb pattern which I find extremely attractive, an impression reading \\&quot;STAINLESS STEEL 6oz\\&quot; on the flask&#x27;s bottom, a grippy screwtop inside the previously mentioned retaining arm, and not much else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing and air-drying overnight, I filled up with a relatively mild rye and spent the day trying to detect any metallic flavor or odor, neither of which made an appearance. Unable to speak to color alteration, though I might test a batch of water in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flask arrived in fine condition, there is no denting, major or minor, the threading on the screwtop and filler neck is pristine, and the filler neck itself is solidly attached to the flask proper. There are some minor cosmetic imperfections, mostly in the form of 4 or 5 tiny gaps in the honeycomb&#x27;s etching distributed randomly across the surface and not noticeable except upon close inspection. More apparent however is a very slightly raised bubbled area roughly the size of a fingernail clipping on the top edge of the flask&#x27;s face, directly adjacent to the upper bevel, presumably from a snafu in the application of the honeycomb pattern/facade, or perhaps evidence of a soldering glitch. Mildly disappointing but not enough to mar the overall appearance of a beautiful implement, or make me pursue an exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last issue worth noting is that the flask I received (on 27 July 2014) did not have the smooth, patternless rectangular area for custom engraving seen on the display item. Not a problem for me; wasn&#x27;t planning on doing anything with it, butif you purchase with the intent to engrave, be advised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Fantastic for the price, expect a few cosmetic anomalies, order one now before the universe realigns itself and there are no longer any affordable high quality flasks available online.</li>
