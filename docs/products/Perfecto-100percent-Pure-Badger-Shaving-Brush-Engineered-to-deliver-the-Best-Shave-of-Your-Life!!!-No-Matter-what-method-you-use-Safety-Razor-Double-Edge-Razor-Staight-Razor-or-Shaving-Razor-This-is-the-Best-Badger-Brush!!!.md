      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Very soft on skin awesome badger feel!</li>
      <li>Awesome product, very good quality for a low price and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I hope the bristles do not start falling out; if they do I will try another brand for sure.</li>
      <li>What more need be said?</li>
      <li>I would love to share this product to my friends and family.</li>
      <li>Creates rich lather, feels nice on th face</li>
      <li>This is a very full brush capable of creating a great lather.</li>
      <li>I strongly advise you invest a bit more into something like one of the Parker brushes which are around $28+ and infinitely better all</li>
      <li>you should always it give it a good wash before the first use.</li>
      <li>He told me he loves this product and it makes shaving much more comfortable for him.</li>
      <li>This is a decent brush,  lathers good and fits in my holder.  </li>
      <li>I just ordered the Semogue 1470, which is made with Semogue&#x27;s best boar bristles, and which is only $12.25 right now.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s been working perfectly fine.</li>
      <li>Great brush, long and durable, the bager bristles works its way into you  pours and gives fast a good lather</li>
      <li>And all for a cheap price</li>
      <li>It is a perfect match for the Perfecto Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand which I have had for over a year and a half and still maintains its shine after I wipe off occasional water spots.</li>
      <li>It also makes it look more high quality.</li>
      <li>appealing- but in hindsight (and having done a lot more reading) I wish I&#x27;d have spent another dollar or two on a premium boar hair brush instead of a cheap badger.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described!</li>
      <li>(in my case, $10.99)—this is a deceptive selling technique on Amazon, putting a relatively high List Price and having the item perpetually on sale so it always seems like a great value.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d watched several YouTube videos showing shavers getting a great lather from their shaving soap (and the soap wasn&#x27;t an issue, as I am/was using Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s Sandalwood), and what this brush did for me was nothing in comparison.</li>
      <li>I love how they make it silver, makes it looks solid and rich.</li>
      <li>This is a pure badger brush and creates a full lather with any soap I have tried both in a bowl and on the face.</li>
      <li>nice brush, soft, no shedding so far, works up a decent lather, and rinses clean.</li>
      <li>There is nothing stellar about this brush, so I can only imagine that all of the great reviews are simply because its badger hair and $11.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d look for another brush or beware the first time</li>
      <li>It is good, as it works better than other more expensive products.</li>
      <li>Constructed very well.</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>the tips are gentle .</li>
      <li>For the price, as a new straight razor shaver trying to get dialed in, I&#x27;m stoked on this purchase.</li>
      <li>Sure, you save a few bucks up front, but you end up paying a lot more for a lot less in the long run, which is precisely what you&#x27;re trying to get away from when you&#x27;re coming from cartridge shaving.</li>
      <li>You want your shaving tools to last, unless you enjoy buying new brushes and breaking them in and eventually throwing them away on a regular basis.</li>
      <li>The bristles still constantly fall out after at least 50 shaves, and the lather is still surprisingly awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had bought 2 others over the years from a local beauty supply shop, but this far and above a better quality brush, for about the same price!</li>
      <li>I did not notice any smell or dye but this is a natural hair product and</li>
      <li>I will request a total and absolute refund.</li>
      <li>I used the brush properly, but it still wasn&#x27;t performing nearly as desirable as anticipated.</li>
      <li>However,  the first time I used it, it created dark gray lather.</li>
      <li>Considering the quality and price of the above combination, which I selected after considerable online research, I think that all three together represent unbeatable value.</li>
      <li>I bought this brush along with several other items in order to give wet shaving a shot, so an ultra cheap badger brush was</li>
      <li>If gives off a strong animal smell and it sheds it&#x27;s thin hare.</li>

<li> /&gt;You don&#x27;t want to be purchasing a new brush every few months (or at least I don&#x27;t), which is likely what you&#x27;d be doing if you went with the Perfecto brush.</li>

<li> The brush was horribly dirty.</li>
<li> That thing stinks.</li>
<li> If you want to powder your face then it might work for you, but for shaving I have never seen a worst product.</li>

    <li> This brush is prefecto, a total recommend such a low price, and it does quality lasts a while for me now, and makes my job way easier now.</li>
    <li> The brush is ok as I have used it for almost a month but now the handle is cracking in several places and looks bad. I hope the bristles do not start falling out; if they do I will try another brand for sure.</li>
    <li> nice brush, soft, no shedding so far, works up a decent lather, and rinses clean.</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for about 2 months now and my skin has gotten way smoother than it has been 2 months ago. I have had no problems with this ever since I bought it and it&#x27;s been working perfectly fine. I bought this for my cousin 1 month ago and she wonders why hadn&#x27;t she bought it before. It is good, as it works better than other more expensive products.</li>
    <li> Perfect addition to the Perfecto stand and the badger hair lathers better than the boar hair brushes!</li>
    <li> Great product! Very soft on skin awesome badger feel! Good quality!</li>
    <li> Bought for husband for father&#x27;s day .he loves it</li>
    <li> great size works up good lather</li>
    <li> Awesome product, very good quality for a low price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This shaving brush is absolutely excellent and comes boxed gift-ready. It is a perfect match for the Perfecto Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand which I have had for over a year and a half and still maintains its shine after I wipe off occasional water spots. I have both matched with a Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor #34C, and the combination simply works as a &amp;#34;matched set&amp;#34;. Considering the quality and price of the above combination, which I selected after considerable online research, I think that all three together represent unbeatable value.</li>
    <li> Great brush, long and durable, the bager bristles works its way into you  pours and gives fast a good lather And all for a cheap price</li>
    <li> This product was a gift to my son, who just had a child. He told me he loves this product and it makes shaving much more comfortable for him. His wife loves the color silver, so I decided to gift him this color. Perfect for adults and teens!</li>
    <li> Nothing perfecto about this brush. If you want to powder your face then it might work for you, but for shaving I have never seen a worst product. If gives off a strong animal smell and it sheds it&#x27;s thin hare. I dare you to apply that soap lather on your face using this brush. I will request a total and absolute refund.</li>
    <li> This is a pure badger brush and creates a full lather with any soap I have tried both in a bowl and on the face. I did not notice any smell or dye but this is a natural hair product and you should always it give it a good wash before the first use.</li>
    <li> I have a stand to put this and the color looks great in my opinion like always perfecto making a good brush I really like it the tips are gentle . It exfoliates my skin after shaving which is great for my skin after I have shaved.</li>
    <li> May not be as fancy as some but it feels good and makes a great lather.</li>
    <li> Love it! For the price, as a new straight razor shaver trying to get dialed in, I&#x27;m stoked on this purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s well made and inexpensive. What more need be said? Buy it.</li>
    <li> This is a very full brush capable of creating a great lather. For the price, this can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> This was great! I had bought 2 others over the years from a local beauty supply shop, but this far and above a better quality brush, for about the same price!</li>
    <li> Constructed very well. Exactly as described!</li>
    <li> There is nothing stellar about this brush, so I can only imagine that all of the great reviews are simply because its badger hair and $11. It makes shaving cream, and it applies it. It also loses several hairs each time (probably a dozen the first time I used it, not to mention turning the shaving cream gray), takes twice as long to whip up cream as my $6 vintage made rite brush, and turns into a wet noodle while applying cream to the face.

    <li> I love how they make it silver, makes it looks solid and rich. It also makes it look more high quality. I would love to share this product to my friends and family. I would recommend this item for you guys as will.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this brush. As someone who&#x27;s just getting into shaving with a safety razor I found it&#x27;s lather to be off-putting to the point where I was reconsidering safety razors altogether. I&#x27;d watched several YouTube videos showing shavers getting a great lather from their shaving soap (and the soap wasn&#x27;t an issue, as I am/was using Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s Sandalwood), and what this brush did for me was nothing in comparison. I used the brush properly, but it still wasn&#x27;t performing nearly as desirable as anticipated. This brush has a &amp;#34;List Price&amp;#34; of $49.99, however it seems always to be on sale for less than $20 (in my case, $10.99)—this is a deceptive selling technique on Amazon, putting a relatively high List Price and having the item perpetually on sale so it always seems like a great value. Well, it&#x27;s a $10 brush and it performs like a $10 brush. The bristles still constantly fall out after at least 50 shaves, and the lather is still surprisingly awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safety razor shaving can be a great way to stop throwing money away on cartridges and canned shaving gels while getting a better result, so why settle for a disposable-quality brush? You want your shaving tools to last, unless you enjoy buying new brushes and breaking them in and eventually throwing them away on a regular basis. I strongly advise you invest a bit more into something like one of the Parker brushes which are around $28+ and infinitely better all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t want to be purchasing a new brush every few months (or at least I don&#x27;t), which is likely what you&#x27;d be doing if you went with the Perfecto brush. Sure, you save a few bucks up front, but you end up paying a lot more for a lot less in the long run, which is precisely what you&#x27;re trying to get away from when you&#x27;re coming from cartridge shaving.</li>
    <li> This is a decent brush,  lathers good and fits in my holder.  However,  the first time I used it, it created dark gray lather. The brush was horribly dirty. Had to wash it three times.  I&#x27;d look for another brush or beware the first time</li>
    <li> This is an awesome brush!!  Creates rich lather, feels nice on th face</li>
    <li> That thing stinks. It works but I can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
