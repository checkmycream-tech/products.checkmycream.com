      <li>I love the fact I can extend my time between salon visits.</li>
      <li>But even more than that, I love it as a root cover-up.</li>

      <li>This is actually a very cool and interesting product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s works wonders, best dry shampoo i&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and makes my hair look much better</li>
      <li>have brown hair but love the gold/blonde powder for some added light tone.</li>
      <li>I was delighted to see it offered at a much lower price on Amazon than I have been paying at my salon.  </li>
      <li>you can easily pack it and not worry about it spilling.  </li>
      <li>It was delivered very quickly.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair and can&#x27;t wash it every day without it breaking.  </li>
      <li>It is a light, fine powder that you use by tapping into your hair.</li>
      <li>I even tried mixing the Keratin with the baby powder hoping I could offset the white and still wasn&#x27;t happy with the result.  </li>
      <li>This is a great dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t get allover the bathroom</li>
      <li>This works on my clean hair, too.</li>
      <li>but I like how it dries up oil and makes hair feel and look clean.  </li>
      <li>My understanding is that the keratin boost from the product actually makes it good for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Color is really good for ash blonde hair</li>
      <li>Works good and with the color, buys me an extra couple of weeks in between highlights.</li>
      <li>I have tried all kinds of sprays for dry shampoo and sticks and paint-on solutions to cover roots and this is by far the best for both.  </li>
      <li>This is great to give your hair a break from heat and other damage.</li>
      <li>The product works great to hide my roots and also makes my hair less greasy in between washes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It leaves the hair smelling fresh and clean with by far the most natural and appealing fragrance.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for those days when you are in a hurry and cannot wash your hair and it starts to show not clean.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re not afraid you&#x27;ll leave your hair looking like it&#x27;s going gray.</li>
      <li>This is actually a useful product.  </li>
      <li>I have a many differnt highlight and low light colors and it blends well with all of them.</li>
      <li>I call it &amp;#34;my golden crack&amp;#34; because I cannot imagine living without it now.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>I can also condition more and absorb any extra to retain</li>
      <li>This is a nifty little dry shampoo that is perfect for air travel -- tiny, light and non-aerosolized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have tried more dry shampoos than I can count</li>
      <li>favorite dry shampoo for blondes.</li>
      <li>I love this dry shampoo!</li>
      <li>The \\&quot; blonde\\&quot; part means that it keeps the areas you apply to extra light.</li>
      <li>The gold color blends really well into my blond hair, and they make a darker one too.</li>
      <li>and therefore I feel it&#x27;s much safer to use.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t last as long as I hoped for, but still ok for a quick fix.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this powder is my favorite</li>
      <li>That makes the price ridiculously high.</li>
      <li>would highly recommend this product and will be purchasing it again when I run out.</li>
      <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as baby powder.  </li>
      <li>I was skeptical, but I am happy with it and will re-order when needed.</li>
      <li>that being said-there is nothing like freshly washed hair-but this will do in a pinch, and it is not white like corn starch</li>
      <li>I like that it isn&#x27;t white like so many dry shampoos are, so</li>
      <li>My hair used to have highlights, but this makes my naturally darker roots lighten up on the days when I don&#x27;t wash my hair.  </li>
      <li>It helps to avoid washing my hair too frequently and also extending the life of a professional blow dry.</li>
      <li>I was dipping the brush into the powder rather than just tipping the whole thing upside down...</li>
      <li>If you get a little too much in one spot then you just comb it through.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m home, I use the Batiste Light and Blonde Dry Shampoo -- much less expensive ($7.00), and a 6.73 oz can of Batiste lasts 3x as long as the 1/3 ounce of Keratin Complex lift powder., and does just as good of a job</li>

<li> I always had a problem with my hair getting oily around my face and this product does the trick and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky and stiff like the spray dry shampoos.</li>
<li> Covers up both the dark roots and the grays in one go.</li>
<li> Works very well, unfortunately for me lasted about a week.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a bit over-sensitive to things, but as the day goes on, this seems to drift down and bother my eyes.  </li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;- non-offensive, slightly fruity smell in the container, but no detectable odor on my hair</li>
<li> It temporarily covers roots and gives me a little body.</li>
<li> Apply just a little and it works.</li>

    <li> A friend recommended this to me.  I&#x27;m only giving three stars because it messy to use and can get on your clothes.  Doesn&#x27;t last as long as I hoped for, but still ok for a quick fix.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the way it makes my hair look.  This is also great for travel bc you can easily pack it and not worry about it spilling.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  So much better than the spray.  I am one very happy customer and will buy again!</li>
    <li> Works very well, unfortunately for me lasted about a week. That makes the price ridiculously high. Found another one that was bigger and worked the same way.</li>
    <li> It was delivered very quickly.  I have been using this dry shampoo for quite a while.  I was delighted to see it offered at a much lower price on Amazon than I have been paying at my salon.  This keeps blondes looking blonde with \\&quot;day two\\&quot; hair.</li>
    <li> I use this every other day in my hair.  I call it &amp;#34;my golden crack&amp;#34; because I cannot imagine living without it now.  I have gone through 6 bottles over the past year.  Never regretted a penny.  My hair used to have highlights, but this makes my naturally darker roots lighten up on the days when I don&#x27;t wash my hair.  It&#x27;s perfect for natural blondes whose hair gets darker at the root the day after washing and blondes-by-choice who want to cover up their roots between touch-ups.  It seriously lightens my hair color and keeps it from sticking to my scalp.  I have fine hair and can&#x27;t wash it every day without it breaking.  This has been the most amazing solution.  I&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoos and nothing comes close to helping.</li>
    <li> I love this product and so does my daughter. Love love love it....... Would give this product to anybody love it</li>
    <li> I was dipping the brush into the powder rather than just tipping the whole thing upside down...silly me, works much better when used as designed.  I like that it isn&#x27;t white like so many dry shampoos are, so you&#x27;re not afraid you&#x27;ll leave your hair looking like it&#x27;s going gray.</li>
    <li> favorite dry shampoo for blondes. also works well to cover up roots</li>
    <li> This works on my clean hair, too. It temporarily covers roots and gives me a little body. It is easy to apply and makes my hair look much better</li>
    <li> Great product! It gives me an extra 1-2 days of not having to wash my hair! I always had a problem with my hair getting oily around my face and this product does the trick and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky and stiff like the spray dry shampoos.</li>
    <li> This is actually a very cool and interesting product. I like it as a dry shampoo, because it&#x27;s not a spray and therefore I feel it&#x27;s much safer to use. But even more than that, I love it as a root cover-up. Covers up both the dark roots and the grays in one go. It takes only a minute to do, and lasts all day. I&#x27;ve always hated going to the salon to get 2&amp;#34; of roots dyed, and now I don&#x27;t have to spend the money on that nearly as often.</li>
    <li> I am a dry shampoo addict. This stuff really works! My biggest problem with all dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried are that they either don&#x27;t work, or the ones that do work run out of aerosol after a few weeks and then I can&#x27;t use it all. This takes care of both of those problems. It is a light, fine powder that you use by tapping into your hair. Then, I just brush it out. The gold color blends really well into my blond hair, and they make a darker one too. Plus, it smells great. My only reason for 4 starts instead of 5 is that it goes SO FAST, and it&#x27;s pretty expensive. But if you can swing it, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit over-sensitive to things, but as the day goes on, this seems to drift down and bother my eyes.  If I could get away with wearing a visor all day (lol), I think I would like it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for those days when you are in a hurry and cannot wash your hair and it starts to show not clean. Apply just a little and it works.</li>
    <li> Very messy; powder is not stable enough for me to use unless in a real pinch. You can&#x27;t touch your hair after you have put it on as it comes off all over your hands and pillow.</li>
    <li> This is a nifty little dry shampoo that is perfect for air travel -- tiny, light and non-aerosolized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- great for travel&lt;br /&gt;- lets me go 3 days without washing&lt;br /&gt;- adds vibrancy to the color (I use the blonde formula) and shine&lt;br /&gt;- non-offensive, slightly fruity smell in the container, but no detectable odor on my hair&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t make me cough like the aerosolized sprays do&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t love:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- at $24 for 1/3 ounce, it is PRICEY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it 5 stars, except for the price factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m home, I use the Batiste Light and Blonde Dry Shampoo -- much less expensive ($7.00), and a 6.73 oz can of Batiste lasts 3x as long as the 1/3 ounce of Keratin Complex lift powder., and does just as good of a job</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Works good and with the color, buys me an extra couple of weeks in between highlights. Kind of pricy though.</li>
    <li> To begin with, it&#x27;s expensive,  but if it had done the job it might be worth it.  Color is really good for ash blonde hair but it really doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as baby powder.  I don&#x27;t like the white color or smell of BP but I like how it dries up oil and makes hair feel and look clean.  I even tried mixing the Keratin with the baby powder hoping I could offset the white and still wasn&#x27;t happy with the result.  The Keratin product made my hair look worse than with nothing at all. I can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy and pleasant to use, great for traveling.&lt;br /&gt; It leaves the hair smelling fresh and clean with by far the most natural and appealing fragrance. It helps to avoid washing my hair too frequently and also extending the life of a professional blow dry. I can also condition more and absorb any extra to retain volume.&lt;br /&gt; My understanding is that the keratin boost from the product actually makes it good for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have brown hair but love the gold/blonde powder for some added light tone. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this powder is my favorite plus it never bothers me the way some others are irritating to the throat.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pricey, no doubt or else I would give it an immediate 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of sprays for dry shampoo and sticks and paint-on solutions to cover roots and this is by far the best for both.  If you get a little too much in one spot then you just comb it through.  I can stretch my time between root touch-ups really easily with this magic powder!</li>
    <li> This product is just amazing. I love the fact I can extend my time between salon visits. The product works great to hide my roots and also makes my hair less greasy in between washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product and will be purchasing it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> This is actually a useful product.  I was skeptical, but I am happy with it and will re-order when needed.</li>
    <li> I wish I had this during Sandy when I had no water. This is great to give your hair a break from heat and other damage. I have dark blonde hair with highlights and keratin. This is a great dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t get allover the bathroom and I can apply it to my roots where I tend to get the most oil. The \\&quot; blonde\\&quot; part means that it keeps the areas you apply to extra light.</li>
    <li> I love this dry shampoo! It&#x27;s works wonders, best dry shampoo i&#x27;ve ever tried. If your hair gets oily within one day of washing it you will love this product!</li>
    <li> I found it hard to apply and not really much difference than similar products.</li>
    <li> that being said-there is nothing like freshly washed hair-but this will do in a pinch, and it is not white like corn starch</li>
    <li> This stuff is fabulous ! My hair was a bit flat and I had put way to much other product on . I didn&#x27;t have time to wash it ...so I used my dry shampoo and Bamm !! ...hair was fluffed up and fab. Awesome product !</li>
    <li> I have tried more dry shampoos than I can count and this is by far the best. It doesn&#x27;t stink. It didn&#x27;t leave a gross residu. A little goes a long way. I have a many differnt highlight and low light colors and it blends well with all of them. It has lasted a lot longer than the canned dry shampoos that I have tried.</li>
