      <li>This is the best shave cream I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;re gonna love it, too!  :D</li>
      <li>The shave is great as is the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I experienced irritation after every stroke of the blade.</li>

      <li>Awesome product if you have super course hair!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also good for shaving underarms and faces.</li>
      <li>Good product, good price.</li>
      <li>The gel is amazingly moisturizing with a pleasant but unobtrusive smell.</li>
      <li>This is a great product without all the crappy additives of most mainstream skin care products.  </li>
      <li>The smell is also lovely!</li>
      <li>This was an impulse buy based on the reviews, and I&#x27;m so glad I one-clicked this product!</li>
      <li>I like this Aveeno Positively Smooth shave gel by far the best and the best of the Aveenos too...  </li>
      <li>This shave gel is perfect, and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Do someone nice for yourself and try this.</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;ve had a wonderful experience with this Aveeno shaving cream.</li>
      <li>So far this is the best shaving cream that Ive used...</li>
      <li>My favorite shave gel.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff &amp; have used it for some time now.  </li>
      <li>When you shave it does give that satisfying \\&quot;shhhhks\\&quot; noise that lets you know you are clearing the foam and anything that is there.  </li>
      <li>Love the shaving cream, that why I ordered six of them.</li>
      <li>I love the ingredients used&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
      <li>I love Aveeno</li>
      <li>No parabens, and enough of the good stuff to help with a smooth shave and nice foam - feels great on the skin.</li>
      <li>I like to try all different products then stick with the best ones.....</li>
      <li>the dispensing is also better.</li>
      <li>It smells pleasant, not heavy or fruity or flowery, just a light pleasant fragrance.</li>
      <li>It is always a challenge to find a good product that helps reduce irritation while still permitting a smooth, clean shave.  </li>
      <li>The scent is very mild, not overpowering like many others.  </li>
      <li>Best of all, your legs actually stay smooth longer.  </li>
      <li>Very good price; these cost a fortune when bought individually.  </li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say about this shave gel, which is actually a good thing.  </li>
      <li>This is a light shave gel that foams when applied.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite shave gel, nothing else compares!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so rich and luxurious</li>
      <li>This soy shaving cream is a better alternative for those who don&#x27;t like the oatmeal version (or are allergic to oatmeal as I am - yes, for real!)  </li>
      <li>Strangely excited about this find.</li>
      <li>and I am always looking for products on the market that provide a clean shave while reducing irritation.</li>
      <li>By the time I opened them up and tested them (was already using a full can purchased elsewhere), no longer had the box or packaging to return.</li>
      <li>I use this on my legs and bikini area, it&#x27;s a great shave gel - gives a smooth shave, it also isn&#x27;t heavily fragranced and it rinses clean.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is the first time in almost five years that I&#x27;ve had a smooth, close shave without a substantial amount of irritation or discomfort.</li>
      <li>I love the way it feels and the slight almond flavor is really nice...</li>
      <li>It producing a super close shave (with the right razor).</li>
      <li>Pleasant smell, and the soy really does help cut down on hair growth.</li>
      <li>I use this for my daily shave and I have never found a better shave cream.</li>
      <li>My legs are smooth, my sensitive skin does not burn or nick</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, especially with the new cap that makes it easier to dispense.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way with this gel and it lathers up beautifully.</li>
      <li>The cream keeps my legs very hydrated</li>
      <li>But I still really like the stuff.  </li>
      <li>It absolutely works.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a floral/fruity smell (or much of a smell at all), if that is something that matters to you.</li>
      <li>The price is quite reasonable and I like that the 6-pack will keep me from running out any time soon.</li>
      <li>They came out with a new rust free bottle which is a major improvement and</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell if it helps me shave less often on my legs as the hair there is super fine.</li>
      <li>It is better to buy in bulk, because it is not easy to find in stores everywhere, And it is much cheaper on here.</li>
      <li>this is what I splurge on to make it a little more tolerable.</li>
      <li>I really do shave less frequently, because my skin stays smooth longer.</li>
      <li>Just a little blob spreads out over a whole leg, and it&#x27;s very slippery and allows a really close shave.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s when you have too much to say that you know something isn&#x27;t working properly.  </li>
      <li>you won&#x27;t smell like an old sailor all day.</li>
      <li>We have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>(Apologies to old sailors.)</li>
      <li>Skin feels very soft and conditioned after shaving, and no little red bumps!</li>
      <li>Given the weight, would have been a major hassle to return.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve recently \\&quot;downgraded\\&quot; from the very expensive Venus razors with the built-in shave gel bars to plain disposable razors because with a shave gel this good, I can use a cheap razor and still get a close shave.</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t save you from having to shave again but you can certainly go a week (after the hair starts growing in finer) and not notice the dark hair on your legs!</li>

<li> but unfortunately for me, this shave gel doesn&#x27;t do anything to help me go longer between shaves on my bikini area, the stubble comes back just as quickly (which makes sense because I rinse the gel off after shaving so it probably isn&#x27;t in contact with my skin long enough to do anything).  </li>

<li> I&#x27;ve seen other reviews of this product that say it did nothing</li>
<li> It comes out as a gel, but it gets like a heavy foam when you spread it-heavy enough that there aren&#x27;t little bits of foam flying all over the place.</li>

    <li> This is the best shave cream I have ever used.  It is thick and foamy when you spread it on and helps avoid nicks.  It is long lasting per can compared to other similar sized products.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff &amp; have used it for some time now.  I buy it in bulk on amazon because it can be a little expensive locally, though well worth a little extra.  The scent is very mild, not overpowering like many others.  Best of all, your legs actually stay smooth longer.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it before, get ya some today - you&#x27;re gonna love it, too!  :D</li>
    <li> I use this on my legs and bikini area, it&#x27;s a great shave gel - gives a smooth shave, it also isn&#x27;t heavily fragranced and it rinses clean.  The downside: Aveeno says this \\&quot;Helps you shave less often\\&quot; but unfortunately for me, this shave gel doesn&#x27;t do anything to help me go longer between shaves on my bikini area, the stubble comes back just as quickly (which makes sense because I rinse the gel off after shaving so it probably isn&#x27;t in contact with my skin long enough to do anything).  But I still really like the stuff.  I can&#x27;t tell if it helps me shave less often on my legs as the hair there is super fine.</li>
    <li> I have tried EVERYTHING there is, and practically every shaving cream on the market. This includes those intended for legs with x number of moisturizers, etc etc. Gillette almost did the trick, but something in their shave gel has always broken out my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I half-heartedly bought this shave gel expecting the same experience; razor bumps, 5&#x27;oclock shadow at 10AM, nicks, cuts, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time in almost five years that I&#x27;ve had a smooth, close shave without a substantial amount of irritation or discomfort. This shave gel is perfect, and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use this shaving cream. We have sensitive skin. This shaving cream never causes us to break out. It is better to buy in bulk, because it is not easy to find in stores everywhere, And it is much cheaper on here.</li>
    <li> My favorite shave gel. Pleasant smell, and the soy really does help cut down on hair growth. After using for a month no 5 o&#x27;clock shadow on the legs if I shave the night before.</li>
    <li> This was an impulse buy based on the reviews, and I&#x27;m so glad I one-clicked this product! The gel is amazingly moisturizing with a pleasant but unobtrusive smell. The can bottom does not rust! Strangely excited about this find.</li>
    <li> I love Aveeno it&#x27;s just like shaving with vanilla pudding! It&#x27;s so rich and luxurious, I never use anything else.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works or not. I used it one time and I broke out in a very painful rash under my arms. It also made my legs itch.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price.</li>
    <li> I like to try all different products then stick with the best ones.....So far this is the best shaving cream that Ive used...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tested numerous shaving cremes and blades-  I like this Aveeno Positively Smooth shave gel by far the best and the best of the Aveenos too...  The shave is great as is the fragrance.  They came out with a new rust free bottle which is a major improvement and the dispensing is also better.</li>
    <li> This soy shaving cream is a better alternative for those who don&#x27;t like the oatmeal version (or are allergic to oatmeal as I am - yes, for real!)  It&#x27;s also a great price for a 6 pack.  It will last forever!</li>
    <li> I used to use the Venus shave gel bar razors. Those weren&#x27;t bad but I would get ingrown hairs often. With this shave gel I have much less ingrown hairs and irritated bumps on my legs. A little goes a long way with this gel and it lathers up beautifully. It isn&#x27;t heavily scented. Also, I notice that after I shave, my legs aren&#x27;t dry and flakey afterwards because this gel is so moisturizing and less harsh then other perfume-y brands. This is my new favorite shave gel, nothing else compares! I&#x27;ve recently \\&quot;downgraded\\&quot; from the very expensive Venus razors with the built-in shave gel bars to plain disposable razors because with a shave gel this good, I can use a cheap razor and still get a close shave.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about this shave gel, which is actually a good thing.  It&#x27;s when you have too much to say that you know something isn&#x27;t working properly.  This is a light shave gel that foams when applied. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the slightly oatmeal-like scent, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming.  When you shave it does give that satisfying \\&quot;shhhhks\\&quot; noise that lets you know you are clearing the foam and anything that is there.

    <li> Best shaving gel out there. My husband and I both use it.</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;ve had a wonderful experience with this Aveeno shaving cream. I really do shave less frequently, because my skin stays smooth longer. It doesn&#x27;t have a floral/fruity smell (or much of a smell at all), if that is something that matters to you. Otherwise, I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product without all the crappy additives of most mainstream skin care products.  No parabens, and enough of the good stuff to help with a smooth shave and nice foam - feels great on the skin.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and I am always looking for products on the market that provide a clean shave while reducing irritation. Unfortunately this shave gel did not deliver even with a new blade. I experienced irritation after every stroke of the blade.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, especially with the new cap that makes it easier to dispense. It smells pleasant, not heavy or fruity or flowery, just a light pleasant fragrance.

Skin feels very soft and conditioned after shaving, and no little red bumps! It&#x27;s also good for shaving underarms and faces.</li>
    <li> I use this for my daily shave and I have never found a better shave cream. I shave my face every day and I hate it, so this is what I splurge on to make it a little more tolerable. I love the way it feels and the slight almond flavor is really nice...you won&#x27;t smell like an old sailor all day. (Apologies to old sailors.) Do someone nice for yourself and try this.</li>
    <li> I have tried a wide variety of products because I have sensitive skin. It is always a challenge to find a good product that helps reduce irritation while still permitting a smooth, clean shave.  I love the ingredients used&lt;br /&gt;in this proudct but unfortunately the glide factor was not there.</li>
    <li> I like the natural soy milk like scent as it is not so artificial. I&#x27;d definitely get it again when I&#x27;m done with current cans.</li>
    <li> Awesome product if you have super course hair! It producing a super close shave (with the right razor). I even got my boyfriend hooked on it and his facial hair is extremely course. The smell is also lovely!</li>
    <li> Love the shaving cream, that why I ordered six of them. Unfortunately, I got snookered by Amazon selling a faulty product.&lt;br /&gt;None of the six cans work. There is either not enough pressure in the can or the depressor tab is not aligned with the nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;Complete waste of money. By the time I opened them up and tested them (was already using a full can purchased elsewhere), no longer had the box or packaging to return. Given the weight, would have been a major hassle to return. Amazon really left a bad taste in my mouth with this one. Too bad there is no zero or negative star option.</li>
    <li> Very good price; these cost a fortune when bought individually.  The cream keeps my legs very hydrated and I haven&#x27;t had any razor burns for months!  I will definitely buy again when this set runs out.</li>
