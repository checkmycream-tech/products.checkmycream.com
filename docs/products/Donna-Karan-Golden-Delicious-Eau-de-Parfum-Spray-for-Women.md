      <li>but my Godaughter was pleased.</li>
      <li>oh my god, i love it</li>
      <li>I love this scent.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of it</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>this is now one of my top 3 fragrances.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this perfume.</li>
      <li>I bought this as a gift for my sister, it was a valuable gift and it really smells very nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not quite as fruity as the regular green delicious, but also not as flowery as the delicious blossom, it&#x27;s just the perfect middle ground.</li>
      <li>Its so light and elegant.</li>
      <li>but I not only got the 3.4 ounce Eau de Parfum spray of DKNY Golden Delicious</li>
      <li>it smells  pretty nice reccomond to everyone</li>
      <li>Golden, Night, and Fredricks are my top three.</li>
      <li>Be Delicious (green one) and</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not apple-y like the original</li>
      <li>It has original scent</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again since its a good daily scent, but might have to find something stronger for night time or special occasions.</li>
      <li>This smell is to die for...very fresh and light and smells like sweet golden apples.</li>
      <li>, the price is so cheap for the whole set like this</li>
      <li>worth buying it online, in store the 3.4 is like 65 bux.</li>
      <li>Awesome, I&#x27;ve just bought one for my wife and I never get tired of smelling it</li>
      <li>Love this perfume, tried a small bottle from a department store and decided to search here for a better deal cant beat the price!</li>
      <li>I love the scent of this perfume, I just wish it was a little more powerful and stayed longer.</li>
      <li>I can wear it to work and feel clean and pretty without drawing too much attention.</li>
      <li>DKNY Golden Delicious is the only perfume that I have been using for the past 3 years.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a light sweet scent that lingers for hours, and I&#x27;m always getting compliments on it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how to describe it, but it isn&#x27;t a strong apple smell, it is more like a soft warm towel that you carried a few apples in for a short time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost like a mix of the 2 actually, but not overly strong.</li>
      <li>but when I got the bottle the fragrance was much stronger than I remembered.  </li>
      <li>I do get compliments on it, but people have to be really up close to really smell</li>
      <li>My wife absolutely loves it.</li>
      <li>Thanks a lot amazon for screwing me over.</li>
      <li>It shipped really fast and was well wrapped.</li>
      <li>I feel like I have to apply more of this than other perfumes.</li>
      <li>This is, hands down, my favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>If I wanted a light body spray I wouldn&#x27;t have spent 50 flippin dollars.</li>
      <li>Soft enough for work, but strong enough u could wear it out for a date or something.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
      <li>this is not a stunning smell, as in unusual, strong, or spicy.  </li>
      <li>With the larger size bottle, hopefully it&#x27;ll last a little while; it isn&#x27;t very cheap, but it is definitely worth every penny.</li>
      <li>This scent is definitely more of a subtle and sensual fragrance than a real head-turner.</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>It smells just as I remember it: gentle, a little sweet, and makes you want to inhale deeply.  </li>
      <li>this is product is far more expected, the shipment is fast and the product comes in as a gift set ( 1 body lotion, 1 extra small perfume, and the 3.4 oz perfume),</li>
      <li>Item is exactly as described and was delivered on its expected arrival date</li>
      <li>(this Golden, the Original green one, the pink floral, and the dark purple Night), and</li>
      <li>It is also a sweet, soft smell, and ver subtle.</li>

<li> and I have not been disappointed.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with Amazon products until now.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with Amazon products until now. I really wanted this perfume for the longest time but it was way too expensive in the department stores. I did my research and amazon sold it at the cheapest price so I decided to buy it. Wow. It is such a weak perfume as if it was watered down or something. I&#x27;m confused because the same perfume at the department store would last for hours where this one lasts maybe an hour and that&#x27;s it. I&#x27;m super frustrated because I can&#x27;t even return it either. If I wanted a light body spray I wouldn&#x27;t have spent 50 flippin dollars. Thanks a lot amazon for screwing me over.</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely loves it. I got it for her this Mother&#x27;s day 2012. She has been wanting this for a while and she likes it a lot. Shipping and packaging was great and as described. Definitely Recommended.</li>
    <li> I received the product expeditiously. I do not &amp;#34;wear&amp;#34; cologne, so I can&#x27;t speak of it&#x27;s quality but my Godaughter was pleased.</li>
    <li> Item is exactly as described and was delivered on its expected arrival date</li>
    <li> I purchased this and received it a few days later.  This is a great bang for your buck and the scent is amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a little gift for me this Christmas. I sampled it before I wrapped it though. :) Smells wonderful. I don&#x27;t know how to describe it, but it isn&#x27;t a strong apple smell, it is more like a soft warm towel that you carried a few apples in for a short time. I have tried 4 of the Delicious Apple fragrances (this Golden, the Original green one, the pink floral, and the dark purple Night), and this is now one of my top 3 fragrances. Golden, Night, and Fredricks are my top three.</li>
    <li> Golden Delicious Women Eau De Parfum Spray by Donna Karan, 3.4 Ounce   I bought this stuff for my wife it smells  pretty nice reccomond to everyone</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  DKNY Golden Delicious is the only perfume that I have been using for the past 3 years.  The scent is that of freshness.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume, tried a small bottle from a department store and decided to search here for a better deal cant beat the price!</li>
    <li> Awesome, I&#x27;ve just bought one for my wife and I never get tired of smelling it and she loves it also!</li>

    <li> Don&#x27;t like the scent.  I had a sample I tried and thought I liked it but when I got the bottle the fragrance was much stronger than I remembered.  It&#x27;s not one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> This smell is to die for...very fresh and light and smells like sweet golden apples. I can wear it to work and feel clean and pretty without drawing too much attention.</li>
    <li> This scent is definitely more of a subtle and sensual fragrance than a real head-turner. One to dab on your pulse points if you’re planning on getting up close with someone.</li>
    <li> Excellent perfume and amazon has it for a way better deal than you will find in a department store!  I like this fragrance better than the DKNY Be Delicious.</li>

    <li> I love the smell of this perfume. The price was great and I received it in two days..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why but I not only got the 3.4 ounce Eau de Parfum spray of DKNY Golden Delicious but I also got a body lotion and a small travel bottle of the parfum. If it was after the holiday inventory being distributed, it was OK by me! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister, it was a valuable gift and it really smells very nice. I definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. Its so light and elegant.</li>
    <li> I bought it for second time!!! it means everything</li>
    <li> This is, hands down, my favorite perfume. It&#x27;s such a light sweet scent that lingers for hours, and I&#x27;m always getting compliments on it. It&#x27;s not quite as fruity as the regular green delicious, but also not as flowery as the delicious blossom, it&#x27;s just the perfect middle ground. With the larger size bottle, hopefully it&#x27;ll last a little while; it isn&#x27;t very cheap, but it is definitely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  I get regular compliments.  It&#x27;s light...somewhat floral but not like your grandmothers fragrance. AND this was definitely a great value.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift.  they loved it</li>
    <li> this is product is far more expected, the shipment is fast and the product comes in as a gift set ( 1 body lotion, 1 extra small perfume, and the 3.4 oz perfume), oh my god, i love it, the price is so cheap for the whole set like this</li>
    <li> Great price, and a great product! The ladies in my family use the entire collection, and amazon has the best prices!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend and I sampled this and agreed this has a lovely smell.  Decided  I would get it for her this past Christmas and I have not been disappointed.  It smells just as I remember it: gentle, a little sweet, and makes you want to inhale deeply.  Just wanted to point out this is not a stunning smell, as in unusual, strong, or spicy.  It just is pleasant and somewhat mild.</li>
    <li> Saw it on amaozn.com and couldn&#x27;t believe the price. It shipped really fast and was well wrapped. I love the smell of it</li>
    <li> The perfume which arrived yesterday is really great. It has original scent and I loved it, just loved it. No dissapointments at all.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I will call this my #2 perfume. It is also a sweet, soft smell, and ver subtle. Sometimes I smell a little eucalyptus honey like smell when I walk back into a room I has just sprayed it. I would probably stick to this one! As this is my #2 perfume!!! I would definitely recommend this one!</li>
    <li> Gran producto, a un gran precio..!! Todo salió tal cual se había acordado. Muy recomendable para realizar compras..!! Excelente calidad</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle of this sweet smell and haven&#x27;t grown tired of it yet. It&#x27;s wonderful that you can get it significantly cheaper than in the high-end retail stores!</li>
    <li> love my perfume, great deal!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed it didn&#x27;t smell at all like the one that I ran out of it wasn&#x27;t even similar.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very lovely smell. It&#x27;s not apple-y like the original Be Delicious (green one) and not as musky/sweet as the Night Delicious (purple one). It&#x27;s almost like a mix of the 2 actually, but not overly strong. Aaammmaazzzinnnngg!! Love it. Soft enough for work, but strong enough u could wear it out for a date or something.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth buying it online, in store the 3.4 is like 65 bux. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Bought this fragrance for my wife&#x27;s b-day after smelling a sample in a magazine. She loves it and her friends do too!</li>
    <li> excellent fragrance is durable and very special.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend</li>
