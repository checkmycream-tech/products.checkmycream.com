      <li>PRUCHASED THIS BRAND IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET AWAY FROM TOO MANY CHEMICALS , BUT COLOR LOOKS GREAT INITIALLY</li>
      <li>The henna cream is easy to use</li>
      <li>Although the henna cream is easy to use, I didn&#x27;t find the instruction sheet (included with the package) very useful, but the Surya Brasil company provides instructions on their website.</li>
      <li>It is completely natural, doesn&#x27;t stink or burn your scalp, holds nice rich earthy color tone.</li>
      <li>Overall a good product.</li>
      <li>And I love the vibrant color of the burgundy shade.</li>

      <li>bright red, not messy like powders, doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor</li>
      <li>It is non-toxic, covers grey, and leaves my hair in amazing condition.</li>
      <li>The henna covers the grey and colors it a nice shade of reddish brown.  </li>
      <li>I achieve vibrant, rich color.  </li>
      <li>some things I have found that help - don&#x27;t shampoo every day, don&#x27;t use hot water and use a sulfate-free shampoo.</li>
      <li>After first rinsing out product, then I leave in2 days before washing.</li>
      <li>This is my first time using the Burgundy.  </li>
      <li>I usually use natural herbal henna to color my hair, but when  I am short on time, I use Surya Henna Cream with excellent results.  </li>
      <li>and I really like the burgundy color.  </li>
      <li>I leave my special mix on for about 90 minutes to get a deep color.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The hair feels soft and is very shiny.</li>
      <li>The burgundy color is beautiful, kind of purple but dark enough that it doesn&#x27;t look too crazy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not 100% natural, but it doesn&#x27;t damage the hair either, so I give it high marks anyway.</li>
      <li>It did not work on my natural hair.</li>
      <li>Surya henna is so much easier to apply than traditional henna.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s the closest to natural that I can find</li>
      <li>Stained everything in sight (instant orange hands) but really colored my hair well.</li>
      <li>Mixing burgundy &amp; black give a nice texture to dark brown hair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is so much easier than the other henna brands I have used that require you to mix and apply the &amp;#34;wet cement&amp;#34; paste that inevitably made the whole bathroom a mess.</li>
      <li>so I use a separate dark towel to dry my hair, since some will come out in first washing.</li>

    <li> received many compliments about my hair color, best way to give Asian dark hair some colorful shine, turns white/grey hairs bright red, not messy like powders, doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor</li>
    <li> I really liked surya henna hair dye. It is completely natural, doesn&#x27;t stink or burn your scalp, holds nice rich earthy color tone. After first rinsing out product, then I leave in2 days before washing. It is a rinse so I use a separate dark towel to dry my hair, since some will come out in first washing. It lasts 3 weeks for me. I was originally half gray and half brown haired,</li>
    <li> My thick hair is well below my waist.  I use 1 1/2 bottles.  Mixing burgundy &amp; black give a nice texture to dark brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;There may be some questionable ingredients but it&#x27;s the closest to natural that I can find (powder is too messy).  I recommend this product to color grey and give a silky shine to aging hair.</li>
    <li> Love this color.  I henna my hair and use this to mute out the orange color.  I get compliments that my hair looks like black cherry.</li>
    <li> Nice hair color, very rich color. Doesn&#x27;t bleed a lot. You don&#x27;t have to mix it as opposed to other henna colors.</li>
    <li> Henna is a great natural way to color your hair while keeping it healthy. I love this pre-mixed version because it is easier to use and the color is perfect every time.</li>
    <li> Love this color and the fact that it dosn&#x27;t damage my hair...is a great plus...</li>

    <li> This product is absolute crap, I wished I didn&#x27;t bought it. I followed the same steps to dye my hair, but i did not work. save your money. Don&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> Surya henna is so much easier to apply than traditional henna. And I love the vibrant color of the burgundy shade. Just an awesome product all around.</li>
    <li> This is the only dye I use that I feel like doesn&#x27;t damage my hair when I dye it. Plus you can reuse it, so if you&#x27;re only doing roots you could make it stretch over 2 uses. The burgundy color is beautiful, kind of purple but dark enough that it doesn&#x27;t look too crazy. A+</li>
    <li> Overall a good product. It&#x27;s not 100% natural, but it doesn&#x27;t damage the hair either, so I give it high marks anyway. The Burgundy shade gives a good wine-red color, though I often have to touch up the stubborn greys at my temples. It&#x27;s the same case with the damaging chemical dyes, so I&#x27;d rather use henna. To get the best of both worlds, I mix Surya Cream with an all natural henna powder to get a really nice smooth paste, a color that stays well, and is also a great conditioning treatment. I leave my special mix on for about 90 minutes to get a deep color. I always use a ceramic mixing bowl, apply the mix with a colorist brush, and I have no problems with dripping.   UPDATE 2015: it seems they&#x27;ve changed their formula to be more natural, which is great. However, you might not get the color saturation or staying power you want. So I did my 50/50 mix of Surya cream and henna powder, and then added about a quarter cup of lemon juice to the mix to help it take to my hair better... And boy did it work. Stained everything in sight (instant orange hands) but really colored my hair well.</li>
    <li> I love this hair color. It is non-toxic, covers grey, and leaves my hair in amazing condition. It is easy to apply and is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This is so much easier than the other henna brands I have used that require you to mix and apply the &amp;#34;wet cement&amp;#34; paste that inevitably made the whole bathroom a mess. It&#x27;s just a bottle with applicator tip and my husband puts it on for me since I can&#x27;t see the top/back :) Covers gray! I do wish the color lasted a bit longer but some things I have found that help - don&#x27;t shampoo every day, don&#x27;t use hot water and use a sulfate-free shampoo. Will continue to buy this for sure!</li>
    <li> This is the only hair color I use.  No mixing - no chemicals - and great color.  i get so many compliments on the great color too.</li>
    <li> It did not work on my natural hair. I saw it work on processed hair. Since my hair is not processed maybe that&#x27;s why it does not work.</li>
    <li> PRUCHASED THIS BRAND IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET AWAY FROM TOO MANY CHEMICALS , BUT COLOR LOOKS GREAT INITIALLY BUT ONLY LASTS A DAY OR SO. AND THE GREY COMES BACK. I DO NOT HAVE THE TIME TO TOUCH UP MY ROOTS DAILY</li>
    <li> This my third time ordering and using Surya Brasil Henna Cream.  This is my first time using the Burgundy.  The henna cream is easy to use and I really like the burgundy color.  I&#x27;m African-American with very coarse, dry 4c hair, about 50% grey in the front and 25% grey in the back.  The henna covers the grey and colors it a nice shade of reddish brown.  Although the henna cream is easy to use, I didn&#x27;t find the instruction sheet (included with the package) very useful, but the Surya Brasil company provides instructions on their website.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all, made hair a little soft though</li>
