<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works very well. Is now my favorite shampoo and it&#x27;s definitely color safe.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  Nice clean smell, love that it&#x27;s organic -- best of all, it works VERY WELL.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome. On time, as described!!!</li>
    <li> Came across this product searching for a baby shampoo to eliminate frizz.  It did such a great job taming her hair, that I gave it a shot and absolutely love it!  It leaves hair a bit heavy, but gives it so much texture.  Makes it easy to hold a curl and adds tons of volume.  So happy I found this product!</li>
    <li> Smells great, isn&#x27;t greasy or too drying, no gross or toxic chemicals either.</li>
    <li> Works great, but not very much in there and I don&#x27;t think I will purchase it again.  Too expensive</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say I was a fan of this shampoo. On day 2 of using it, my hair looked like it hadn&#x27;t been washed in a week. My hair tends to be greasy after a day anyway, and the added oil in this shampoo was perhaps too much for me. I don&#x27;t know, but I couldn&#x27;t make it work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this shampoo and conditioner for a few days, but so far I am very impressed. I have very curly, very fine short hair that is thinning a bit in the front. These products do not weigh my hair down at all, and do seem to add some volume. They are not harsh or overly scented. Loving them so far!</li>
    <li> I like everything from this company. this shampoo is a tich drying to my hair. It didn&#x27;t work well in the winter but now in our humid summer it works fine. Love the gentle natural smell</li>
    <li> I really like the sent and the shampoo does a good job as a body wash as well.  The larger bottle is a better value than the tube.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells good and feels good. I wish it made my hair feel cleaner for longer - I have to wash almost every other day for it not to feel oily. But I can deal with that because it&#x27;s completely organic and non-toxic. Thanks Acure!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this and the conditioner and I am hooked. Works great and is good for you!</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner. I have very hard water and everything else I have tried leaves my hair dry. I switched to naturtint haircolor because the traditional products burn my head. The hair color had some organic shampoo and conditioner in it and that made my hair feel very soft. That&#x27;s why I tried the Acure. Great product so far. And smell is awesome!</li>
    <li> Its a nice product for every day use anything organic is good:) maybe i can order more n future  , not bad !</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Good rating on the EWG Skin Deep site (aka low toxicity) and no animal testing! Love the minty fragrance and it is the BEST natural shampoo &amp; conditioner I&#x27;ve tried - and I&#x27;ve tried a ton of them.</li>
    <li> I love how it smells and I love how our hair feels afterwards. I wanted to get something safe and natural for myself, but mainly so I can also use it on my two year old daughter. I hate having to buy several different hair products so now we can use the same stuff.</li>
    <li> I like the company&#x27;s philosophy and the ingredients look great, but it doesn&#x27;t translate into a great shampoo.  Doesn&#x27;t suds much and left my hair/scalp feeling not that clean. Smells nice.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works well for my thick hair. It gives so much volume, keeps ingredients simpler, organic, more plant-based than many of the hair care products I&#x27;ve tried nearing the 100% organic realm. Whole Foods or Raisin Rack (Ohio grocer) many times have this product for less than Amazon, just an FYI for those looking to leave the chemicals out of your toiletries cost effectively! :)</li>
    <li> Smells fresh and also feels fresh.</li>
    <li> Love these products. Has organic ingredients. Love the smell. Definitely notice a difference in volume in my hair [3A/b curly, thin]. Will use/buy again.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best smelling shampoos I&#x27;ve ever come across and has a rich, satisfying lather. The mint aroma really pops and is great for that morning wake-me-up.  I&#x27;ve tried some very high-end shampoos that are double the price, but this shampoo is now my go-to.  My hair doesn&#x27;t even need a separate conditioner other than a couple of spritzes of Acure&#x27;s leave in argan oil conditioner on workday mornings.  My blonde hair tends to be on the drier side and has some very slight body.  This shampoo helps enhance the body if I want to let hair air dry and makes it manageable if I am blow-drying.</li>
    <li> This shampoo/conditioner combo is great! The smell is refreshing (and nice to wake up to in the shower) and it makes my hair feel wonderful! The shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip the moisture from my hair (which is why it doesn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean) but it does cleanse it with only one application!</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money. Made my hair flat.</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo for fine limp hair!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the products I have purchased from Acure. This shampoo is nice. The lid is a little hard to get off each use which is annoying though. I usually have to repeat twice to get a good fresh clean feel to my hair. It smells nice and I like the company&#x27;s attention to organic, natural options.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m SUCH a sucker for anything mint scented. My boyfriend and I purchased a bottle each in NYC at a health food market. I used mine only a few times do to my forming dreadlocks then I gave him my bottle. However, it made my hair feel soft yet fluffy. It SMELLS amazing for those who love the smell of mint like me. It made my hair feel SUPA clean. All in all I would totally recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I tried to like this shampoo and the companion conditioner.  I have fine shorter hair that is color treated.  The shampoo and conditioner seemed to leave a film on my hair which resulted in dulling my hair.  It also caused my hair to fall out more than usual and also made my scalp feel cruddy.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. After trying so many shampoos that were marketed to add volume to the hair and failed, this one actually worked.  It made my hair full and the fullness lasted until the next shampoo.  I did use a leave in conditioner.  Will keep purchasing this winner.</li>
    <li> Took some getting used to as I always used to the toxic shampoos that would give u a good lather but I liked it. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this product as it got great reviews on amazon and via a Google search.  My hair is typically fine, thin, and can get greasy.  This product dried out my hair, clogged the pores on my scalp, and made my scalp itch.  Same thing happened to my daughter when she used it.  When she started to complain about her head itching I first thought lice (since we battled it this past winter).  After a through check numerous times and finding nothing, the only other change we have made is this product.  Will not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> In love with this shampoo. Clean ingredients, smells great, suds up and really cleans hair amazingly well!&lt;br /&gt;Love the whole acure line!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo as I was looking to move towards a more natural shampoo. I noticed a drastic increase in hair fall after I started using this. I noticed like the other reviews that it seems to leave my hair dry (I did not use their conditioner).</li>
    <li> Just what I was expecting. Thank you for the great product. Works well with my hair and was a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Pros: Cleans hair really well&lt;br /&gt;  smells nice when you apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: Leaves scalp and hair dry&lt;br /&gt;  after shower doesn&#x27;t smell like anything&lt;br /&gt;  makes your hair like straw&lt;br /&gt;  strips all oils off your head</li>
    <li> After developing allergies to tons of chemicals in shampoos and conditioners, I found Acure and I love this shampoo and conditioner. It has a nice mint smell, leaves my hair clean and voluminous, and causes no allergic reactions. Truly a win win.</li>
    <li> my favorite volume shampoo!</li>
    <li> As a shampoo it works well. It foams which I like but doesn&#x27;t dry out your scalp too much. It seems to work as well as any other foaming shampoo I have bought.</li>
    <li> Love this too ,thx emily</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo I buy for my husband&#x27;s oily, fine and thin hair. It smells nice enough and does a decent job of volumizing. We also use together with Kiss My Face&#x27;s Big Body Conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo! Makes my hair nice and smooth. I will recommend this to anyone. The fact that it&#x27;s organic means that it won&#x27;t damage your hair which helps me sleep at night!</li>
    <li> I choose this because it is organic and is mint flavor, which is perfect for Summer usage. Fast shipping. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am happy with the scent, but I did have a bit of a reaction to it.</li>
    <li> As someone who avoids synthetic chemicals at all costs, this shampoo is not only great for my hair, it&#x27;s great for my wallet. Most natural shampoos are upwards of 30$ and often tend to be very heavy. For my fine, at times limp, hair, this stuff gives it a littly oomph. I use it with the Acure leave-in conditioner and John Masters sea salt spray.</li>
    <li> Best volumizing shampoo ever!!! My hair looks fab every time I use it and I don&#x27;t have to wash it for 3 days easily.</li>
    <li> Clean my hair. Smells of mint. Good for the environment and animals. I like the product but I am not amazed by it.</li>
    <li> It smells good but I was expecting more based on the reviews here and in beauty magazines.  The conditioner didn&#x27;t untangle my hair like other products have.  If you have extra money, go for it.</li>
    <li> Love this!!! Finally found a great organic shampoo after a long search and lots of fails! I&#x27;ve got fine hair if that&#x27;s any help.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. With most natural hair products, there is very little lather and scent, but not the case with this! I feel like a little goes a very long way, especially on the coordinating conditioner so use sparingly. I have very fine hair that is in rehab from some not so great coloring mistakes and this is working so well on restoring, but not sacrificing my volume. The only drawback is the price. This has lasted about 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t love it, didn&#x27;t know any additional volume.</li>
    <li> It was good, but quantity for the price is not fair. So, I stopped purchasing it.</li>
    <li> This left my hair feeling very rough, which is quite an accomplishment as my hair is normally very healthy and smooth.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the scent and have never had a better organic hair product than what Acure offers!</li>
    <li> First shampoo that actually burned my skin.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and this shampoo just tangles up, I thought it would be better, but didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Another great product from Acure Organics. I am in love with their Shampoo/Conditioner line, as well as everything else I have tried from them. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their products are high quality and I always see instant results with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Shampoo smells great and leaves my hair feeling light yet volumized, BABY SOFT, and looking/smelling great. Highly recommend for anyone. Great product.</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased this shampoo and I really do like how pure and free of build up my hair is afterwards.</li>
    <li> My hair is frequently dry, flat, and its fine. This set shampoo and conditioner work better for me than for most of the unhealthy chemical laden stuff! I love the way it smells, the conditioner detangles, and the shampoo lathers nicely and gets my hair clean (but not stripped and more dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep trying to find something cheaper, but nothing compares, so it&#x27;s worth the price to me.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has amazing ingredients and that is why I am using it, however it leaves my hair feeling like a straw, so if I don&#x27;t use a conditioner after I shampoo it really makes my hair feel dry and unhealthy.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel the peppermint as much as I would like to. It does not feel like fresh and minty.&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this product a 4 because of the ingredients.</li>
    <li> When I received the product the smell of it wasn&#x27;t so pleasant. It could have been a great hair product but I&#x27;m really picky and would much rather find a product with a scent of my liking.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I love Echinacea in anything. When I saw this I had to try it. It smells nice and you only need a tiny bit to go a long way, and I have a lot of hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of Shampoos and conditioners.  Even the more expensive brands like Aveda.  It all starts out the same.  My hair looks great for the first few days or maybe a week...then...all down hill.  My hair starts to look weighed down or greasy and lifeless.  There is no volume or shine.  I took a leap and decided to try Acure Organics, Pure Mint and Echinacea Stem Cell.  It&#x27;s been about two or three weeks and I am still pleasantly surprised.  My hair feels full, soft and has it&#x27;s natural wave back.  It has shine and volume.  I&#x27;m hoping with all my heart that I continue to be surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATE 7/8/13****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to give everyone an update.  I have been now using this shampoo for about 2 months and I still love it.  This NEVER happens.  By now I&#x27;ve most likely stop using a shampoo and would have 2 or 3 different shampoos sitting in the shower.  This shampoo makes my hair feel full, soft and I&#x27;ve had many compliments on the shine.  I have red-auburn hair naturally so it&#x27;s very difficult to find a shampoo that helps maintain color.  This shampoo definitely does.  I&#x27;ve even notice the red being more vibrant.  My hair continues to have a nice natural wave to it that has been gone for years or would flaten when dried.  I use the conditioner only a couple times a wk so I&#x27;ve got a pretty full bottle still...which is awesome.  I&#x27;ve gone through 2 bottles of shampoo as I often wash my hair twice in the shower.  I&#x27;ve also been putting organic Sesame Oil in my hair at night and washing it out in the morning.  This works very well and my hair loves it.  I will definitely be buying another bottle.  The only bad thing I have to say is that my local whole foods store now has a smaller bottle of the shampoo.  I believe I originally bought a 12 oz bottle along with the 12 oz conditioner.  Now they only have an 8 oz bottle but it&#x27;s the same price.  I was pretty disappointed in that but not enough to stop buying it.  Still 5 stars!!!</li>
    <li> I love the mint.  My hair is dry and this shampoo keeps it looking healthy, it definitely moisturizes it and the conditioner is really moisturizing as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a local Whole foods store. The list of ingredients seems organic enough. Good ingredients and all, however, this stuff doesn&#x27;t clean your hair. My scalp feels itchy the next day and I feel the urge to wash my hair every 2 days or it will get REALLY itchy and oily. (which is bad because it is recommended that you only wash your hair twice a week). What use is a shampoo if it doesn&#x27;t clean your hair? Moreover, the shampoo has to be used along side a conditioner, or else your hair will feel like straws after washing. I am willing to assume that this stuff&#x27;s mission is to increase your hair volume which it does, so I decided to switch to the green line, which is the ACURE every day clarifying shampoo. I will see how it works and update this comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I tried Acure everyday clarifying shampoo. That one is fantastic. I only have to wash my hair every 3 to 4 days with no significant head scratchings (literally) in between. I use the mint conditioner along with this green shampoo so as to achieve both clean hair and hair volume, and that seems to be working great!</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this shampoo!  It lathers well and cleans without overstripping, and I don&#x27;t have to say that it&#x27;s good \\&quot;for a vegan shampoo\\&quot; - it&#x27;s just a good shampoo.  The only thing I don&#x27;t love is the smell.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like mint, it smells like Sea Breeze astringent.  But I will happily try the other varieties of Acure shampoo to find one I like the smell of, because this stuff is great.</li>
    <li> Awesome natural shampoo.  The scent is amazing!  Washes really well.  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Very nice sulphate free  volumizing shampoo . Have been using it for over an year now . Will continue to use it .</li>
    <li> I was looking for something comparable to Moroccan Oil shampoo and conditioner but for a better price. I think this product (shampoo AND conditioner) is actually better than the Moroccan oil! Leaves my hair feeling very soft and I think the product actually does add volume. At least compared to other \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; shampoos and conditioners. Has a nice minty smell, not too overpowering. And you can&#x27;t beat the price, especially if you&#x27;re a prime member, for the amount you get in the bottles! (I have very thin, highlighted hair)</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo a couple of weeks ago. I find this shampoo to be more cleansing than my Burt&#x27;s Bees sulphate free. One shampoo get my hair totally clean. It also provides more body.  I have very fine hair that gets greasy easily, but I have to agree with other reviews that its a bit drying to the hair even with conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love all of the Acure products and all the shampoos and I usually switch the type according to the season and what my hair seems to need. I was really impressed with this one and I love how light it is and it smells great. All natural Head&amp;Shoulders.</li>
    <li> Suds and smells great. Wish I didn&#x27;t have to use so much to get my hair clean. I only wash my hair once a week though and use arrowroot powder to keep it from looking greasy so that&#x27;s a lot to remove. I wash my hair two times one right after the other and it works best this way.</li>
    <li> This line of shampoos is great, judged against natural and conventional ones! It lathers well, it cleans well and it smells amazing (and not fake). I especially like the Argan one for days where I don&#x27;t want to bother with conditioner, and the Mint one for days when I want volume or just to feel more awake in the shower. The price is good and they have good safety ratings from Environmental Working Group, so there&#x27;s just really no reason to use a conventional shampoo!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the way my hair smells, feels, and looks!!!  I am so glad that I received a sample of this product to try...</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews I read I was expecting to have luxurious, flowing hair after using this product but instead I got flat, dull hair that felt like it was never clean. It felt as if there was a constant residue. I used the shampoo for two weeks then went back to the cheap drugstore shampoo I&#x27;ve used for years and my hair went back to feeling like normal.</li>
    <li> Intense volume, low poo. Love it. Smells amazing.</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite shampoo. I have a very fine thin hair and I produce more sebum than anyone I&#x27;ve ever met except for my father. I love the shampoo so much and I use it every day. I do add 10 drops of Teatree oil to it and shake it up really well I have not found a shampoo that can do what this does for my hair. I wash with it twice and it takes all the oil off of my scalp and then the blue conditioner I use on the ends does not weigh my hair down at all. My hair looks extremely healthy shiny and soft and very manageable. I just can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about the shampoo. I don&#x27;t even get split ends!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Really does volumnize!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  It lathers really good.  I was surprised at how well it did lather with it being organic.  Nice.</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo and it made my curly coarse hair so soft.  It smells refreshing and made my hair feel amazing.  My husband even noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo and conditioner - they smell great.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but it works . Nice volume and easy to manage hair . Highly recommended . I am not crazy about the smell but I think I can get used to it .</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo brand. I have three of their shampoos ( all different scents) and two different conditioners and love them all.&lt;br /&gt;Best part is they are organic with no harmful ingredients.</li>
    <li> Love it. Pretty strong smelling... I think I like the lemongrass flavor better.</li>
    <li> I bought this and the conditioner. Both seem high quality, but as far as a guy&#x27;s hair, I really didn&#x27;t see much difference.  I might buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and am on my second bottle.  I have damaged thin hair and I appeciate the conditioner is helping my hair feel conditioned but not greasy. This is also one of the few products that doesn&#x27;t give me a rash on my back after rinsing my hair.</li>
    <li> This is great.  Smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Favorite shampoo ever. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this shampoo claimed to be moisturizing so maybe deducting a star for that is not really fair, but I do think that my hair is not as manageable after using this shampoo than after using others I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I still like it.  It has a great smell &amp; it does clean well.</li>
    <li> I really liked this brand for natural ingredients, contains no chemical substances under so it does not damage the hair, buy different products of this brand and that favorable results in all aspects</li>
    <li> Awesome shampoo! Makes your hair feel really nice and lean!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo looking for something non-toxic that still worked. I quickly realized that my hair wasn&#x27;t getting that clean with this shampoo. With traditional product I can usually go 3-4 days between washes before my hair gets oily. With this shampoo I had to wash my hair every other day, and on day 2 it is still pretty oily. My partner also used the product and he has super oily hair and he sometimes felt like he had to wash his hair twice in one day since it just wasn&#x27;t cleaning his hair well. I&#x27;ll keep looking for something that works better for my hair.</li>
    <li> Gave it 5 stars BUT with only one reservation: it&#x27;s not a body building shampoo and it left my hair too soft.  However, it turned out to be FANTASTIC for another family member who has long, thick hair which was looking damaged, dry and frizzy.  After only a few washes, I could not believe the improvement. Her hair looks healthy, super shiny and manageable. The delicately minty scent  is very pleasant.  Rinses clean easily. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Wonderful.  No scent, goes on nicely, and absorbs quickly.  No greasy residue.  Really softens one&#x27;s skin, too.  I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I have fallen in love with every single Acure Organics product that has hit the market. They get it right every single time! Their ingredients are nothing but organic, natural, fair trade products. They never contain any chemicals, and a portion of the purchase ($1 for every product) goes to Breast Cancer Awareness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Acure Mint shampoo and Conditioner are simply quite amazing if I do say so myself. They smell amazing (a nice minty scent) the shampoo has a nice rich lather, and doesn&#x27;t take very much at all to wash my entire head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is thick and creamy, yet doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;weigh down\\&quot; the hair. It leaves my hair feeling clean, refreshed, and seems to have more volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is always soft when I use this combo, and it seems like my dry, flaky scalp doesn&#x27;t act up as much because of the peppermint ingredients inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working the shampoo into the scalp produces a nice tingle..oohh how relaxing. I can also work this one all the way to the ends without it over drying and frizzing out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell even when I&#x27;m still in the shower that my hair actually has some Oomph to it. I really like the volume it adds. I simply LOVE it! There&#x27;s nothing like Acure on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic, eco-friendly, AND pocket friendly!</li>
    <li> too frizzy - I went back to my old shampoo</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a bunch of different kinds of shampoos/conditioners for fine, limp hair and nothing has worked. They usually weigh it down or make it greasy looking (which happens naturally anyway). I&#x27;ve used this for about a week and LOVE it! I love the smell, how little I have to use, how much it foams up, and that there are no chemicals in it. I have eczema on my scalp so it gets flaky during certain seasons. This shampoo/conditioner combo has worked wonders for my hair. I don&#x27;t feel like I need to put extra products in after my shower. It leaves my hair light and gives the roots body. I&#x27;ve started using this on my daughters hair also (they have the same problems).</li>
    <li> I like the smell and works great. I have tried tons of natural, organic brands and the Acure Organics Brand is my favorite so far. It does not weigh my hair down and cleanses well.</li>
    <li> Love the way smells, it really wakes me up in the morning.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the shampoo. It helped with volume as well.</li>
    <li> My dry frizzy hair lay down and behaved after my first wash. I also got unsolicited comments from friends on the improvement in my hair. I am a fan!</li>
