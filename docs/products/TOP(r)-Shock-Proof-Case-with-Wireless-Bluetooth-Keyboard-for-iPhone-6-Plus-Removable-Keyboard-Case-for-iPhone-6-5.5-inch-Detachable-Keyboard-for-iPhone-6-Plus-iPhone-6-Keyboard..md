      <li>I use the memories app and love how handy it is to put an entry into my diary.&lt;br /&gt;Being bluetooth</li>
      <li>But I love the keyboard.</li>
      <li>I think the case itself could be better.</li>
      <li>also found the fit for my phone nice and snug and the velcro on the keyboard  is strong.</li>
      <li>I would love to buy more of the free cases she send me.</li>
      <li>Very cool to have but not that functional.</li>
      <li>I was amazed at how responsive the keyboard is and how easy it was to set up.</li>
      <li>I was amazed at how responsive the keyboard is and how easy it was to set up.</li>
      <li>When I want to watch a video the phone flips right out over the keyboard and stands right up at a good angle.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>I really enjoy using this.</li>
      <li>This rechargable bluetooth external keyboard is a great addition to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 SmartPhone .</li>
      <li>Cool item, works great however not something I use daily</li>
      <li>The package arrived in tact, the case is nice, well-made, but as far as functionality, it&#x27;s not there.</li>
      <li>but this one is nice and smooth and the keys stick up just enough for a light touch and ease of typing.</li>
      <li>: Keyboard easily syncs with the phone on the first try.  </li>
      <li>The leatherette case is nice enough if you like that style of case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it seems like it will be a fun item to use</li>
      <li>Now if I can only find one in hot pink, lol!</li>
      <li>First, the case is floppy</li>
      <li>and I strongly prefer physical keyboards.  </li>
      <li>Why would I want to carry this extra thing around when the keyboard on the phone works fine.</li>
      <li>I really like this Bluetooth keyboard for this Samsung phone.</li>
      <li>didnt really use it as much as i thought i would.</li>
      <li>It has a real number row, punctuation, and navigation keys.  </li>
      <li>This is not what I excepted, very unsatisfied.</li>
      <li>Customer send it with an extra case for free.</li>
      <li>someone made a proper keyboard built into a case, maybe a slider model like my old phone, I&#x27;d pay top dollar, but this item doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
      <li>so I have a nice small tablet when I want.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Reading the reviews, I knew that this keyboard would make an already large phone even bigger, but that was a compromise I was willing to make for a real keyboard.&lt;br</li>
      <li>its still small though for being able to use it to type efficienly.</li>
      <li>and it arrived earlier than I expected and with an extra case included as a gift nice</li>
      <li>It comes off so easily that I need to be extra careful.</li>
      <li>The seller was professional and shipped quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>its not bad but with a keyboard and the phone in the holder the keyboard rubs back and forth its just not a good fit inside it</li>
      <li>I found that I had to type more slowly and deliberately with this keyboard than with the virtual keyboard on the phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>not only because it works well but also because they surprised me with and extra leather wallet case  </li>
      <li>Would be a little better if the back of it was at least sturdy material.</li>

<li> this make sense?&amp;#34; The keyboard that came with my phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 3) is about a half inch smaller.</li>
<li> Second, the raised keys are a soft rubber with a &amp;#34;mushy&amp;#34; feeling that makes fast typing impossible.  </li>

<li> I can&#x27;t stand &amp;#34;Sywpe&amp;#34; and other 1 finger text entry systems.  </li>

<li> so I have now passed this keyboard down to my daughter.  </li>
<li> If you hold the keyboard to thumb type, the phone flops down out of view.  </li>
<li> I use it with another case typically.</li>
<li> I have to say that I&#x27;m amazed of the functionality of this little keyboard, the unfortunate part is that I have long but active length nails that I refuse to give up</li>
<li> Not worth it!!  </li>
<li> but no better (somethings not as well) than the keyboard that came with the phone.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t believe I wasted money and a gift card on this!!</li>
<li> Just doesn&#x27;t give a sense of where the fingers are and allow for any speed or serious use.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about this keyboard except the long delivery time.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s crap!!  </li>

    <li> I am using the keyboard now to write this. the product is good  its still small though for being able to use it to type efficienly.</li>
    <li> Not what I thought and it didn&#x27;t say no returns. Now I&#x27;m stuck with something I can&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I&#x27;m amazed of the functionality of this little keyboard, the unfortunate part is that I have long but active length nails that I refuse to give up so I have now passed this keyboard down to my daughter.  I gave it five stars not only because it works well but also because they surprised me with and extra leather wallet case  (no brand name on it) for my iPhone 6 plus.  I love it!!!  Now if I can only find one in hot pink, lol!</li>
    <li> Very cool to have but not that functional. didnt really use it as much as i thought i would.</li>
    <li> Thank you for your soeed delivery and kind gifts ! I love my bluetooth keyboard!!!</li>
    <li> This rechargable bluetooth external keyboard is a great addition to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 SmartPhone . The keyboard arrived partially charged, paired correctly, and worked as promised. The only improvement that I can think of would be to have larger font size for the instructions or a link to a .pdf file.  The extra order gidts were a plus as well.</li>
    <li> Case is well made and attractive. I was very happy with the ease of connecting the keyboard it to my  phone. I have tried others that had glitches even after I finally got them connected but this one is nice and smooth and the keys stick up just enough for a light touch and ease of typing. I find it very  handy when I want to type more than just a message. I use the memories app and love how handy it is to put an entry into my diary.&lt;br /&gt;Being bluetooth it makes it so I can hook up my mouse with the USB and the keyboard bluetooth so I have a nice small tablet when I want.&lt;br /&gt;I also found the fit for my phone nice and snug and the velcro on the keyboard  is strong. When I want to watch a video the phone flips right out over the keyboard and stands right up at a good angle.&lt;br /&gt;Good buy!</li>
    <li> The only improvement that I would make would be the buttons, it is a little too easy to press the wrong button. But I like the product overall. And thank you for the bonus gifts.</li>
    <li> This 2 star review is for the product, not the seller.  The seller was professional and shipped quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this when I got my Galaxy Note 3 phone because I do a lot of texting and I strongly prefer physical keyboards.  I can&#x27;t stand &amp;#34;Sywpe&amp;#34; and other 1 finger text entry systems.  Reading the reviews, I knew that this keyboard would make an already large phone even bigger, but that was a compromise I was willing to make for a real keyboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: I found the product to be unusable for two reasons.  First, the case is floppy so you can&#x27;t properly thumb type while holding they keyboard and the phone in place.  If you hold the keyboard to thumb type, the phone flops down out of view.  Second, the raised keys are a soft rubber with a &amp;#34;mushy&amp;#34; feeling that makes fast typing impossible.  I found that I had to type more slowly and deliberately with this keyboard than with the virtual keyboard on the phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Keyboard easily syncs with the phone on the first try.  It has a real number row, punctuation, and navigation keys.  The leatherette case is nice enough if you like that style of case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I gave up trying to use this and switched over to the virtual keyboard and the stylus with handwriting recognition.  I bought a UAG case and this keyboard is in my gadget box in the closet, perhaps I&#x27;ll find a use for it at some point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If someone made a proper keyboard built into a case, maybe a slider model like my old phone, I&#x27;d pay top dollar, but this item doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
    <li> The case came in about a week and to my surprise there was an additional Louis Vuiton case included. I was amazed at how responsive the keyboard is and how easy it was to set up. I would definitely recommend this case.</li>
    <li> Cute keyboard works good.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this. I think the case itself could be better. But I love the keyboard. I use it with another case typically.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about this keyboard except the long delivery time. Don&#x27;t believe the 6-10 day promised on the website.&lt;br /&gt; Delvery delay aside, The keyboard works as described. After it was connected I asked myself &amp;#34;Does this make sense?&amp;#34; The keyboard that came with my phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 3) is about a half inch smaller. Why would I want to carry this extra thing around when the keyboard on the phone works fine. The only answer I could come up with is that I&#x27;m a gadget freak. So if you have this illness too....get the keyboard. It works great but no better (somethings not as well) than the keyboard that came with the phone.</li>
    <li> It was excellent. Customer send it with an extra case for free. I would love to buy more of the free cases she send me.</li>
    <li> Was just what I was looking for.  I gave this as a gift to my girl friend, she is very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is not what I excepted, very unsatisfied. Can&#x27;t afford to return it</li>
    <li> its not bad but with a keyboard and the phone in the holder the keyboard rubs back and forth its just not a good fit inside it so I&#x27;ve been taking the keyboard out and just using the covers separate</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s crap!!  Not worth it!!  I can&#x27;t believe I wasted money and a gift card on this!!</li>
    <li> The case came in about a week and to my surprise there was an additional Louis Vuiton case included. I was amazed at how responsive the keyboard is and how easy it was to set up. I would definitely recommend this case.</li>
    <li> I really like this Bluetooth keyboard for this Samsung phone. The case provides protection for the phone in case it falls and makes my phone easier to operate.</li>
    <li> The product worked for only two days and has since not work.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t contact the seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve yet to find this bluetooth unit working... The package arrived in tact, the case is nice, well-made, but as far as functionality, it&#x27;s not there.</li>
    <li> I like it!! It works well for what I need it for. It&#x27;s not to big and I can still put it in my pocket. I would definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the item yet but it seems like it will be a fun item to use and it arrived earlier than I expected and with an extra case included as a gift nice</li>
    <li> Just doesn&#x27;t give a sense of where the fingers are and allow for any speed or serious use.  Would be a little better if the back of it was at least sturdy material.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. My only complaint is with the velcro. It comes off so easily that I need to be extra careful.</li>
    <li> Cool item, works great however not something I use daily</li>
    <li> A++++++++++++. Works like a charm.</li>
