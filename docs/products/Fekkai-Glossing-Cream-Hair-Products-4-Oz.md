<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use hair conditioner after shampooing so this works wonderfully: gives my hair the control &amp; shine I&#x27;m looking for and keeps it soft and natural looking. I highly recommend it! I am female and somewhat grey-headed, so softness is primary!</li>
    <li> Me and my naturally curly but processed with color hair love love love this product more than the words here can possibly describe.  For over 20 years I have tried every gel, creme, mousse, and oil imaginable.  And while I still love to try other products upon occasion, Fekkai Glossing Cream is my infallible go-to in every occasion.  Humid?  Dry?  Hot?  Cold?  No matter where I travel or what the season my hair is always perfectly shiny and lightly separated into its curls.  Never crunchy.  Never greasy.  Not sticky or tacky.  Shiny, healthy, and perfect.  Getting my favorite hair product with all the perks of Amazon Prime is a match made in hair heaven!!!</li>
    <li> I tried the Glossing Creme as part of a Fekkai Bzz campaign and I am so impressed with this product!  I love it, definitely a new keeper for me.  It does everything it says &amp; I love the results.  My hair has frizz issues, this cream tames it and leaves a noticeable sheen that brings out my brunette highlights.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feel either - my hair still feels soft and natural, not like it has product in it.  When I first applied it to my hand before using it on my hair, the pearlescent-like sheen is very noticeable and is as impressive when it&#x27;s on my locks!   For me, I liked it much better than JF&#x27;s glossing creme, with more noticeable results.</li>
    <li> I received some free sample packets of the Glossing Creme as part of my Bzz kit for the Fekkai campaign. I have been using this creme as directed (pea sized amount on damp or dry hair). I have to say this is great for smoothing frizzies and moisturizing dry ends.My hair glows after using it, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just rub a tiny amount between your hands and then rub it over your hair. I even massage the residue into the skin on my hands afterwards, and it moisturizes them too- no stickiness like with other hair products! The creme has a very outdoorsy smell- fresh and not too strong, in my opinion. I love the way it makes my hair look and feel, and I don&#x27;t need the silicone frizz serum or other finishing products when I use this. I had to use at least a quarter size dollop of those products to have acceptable results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will take a little while to use all of the packets, but I will definitely buy some when I get low on the freebies. I would replace a few DS products, so it is actually cost-effective to buy the more expensive Fekkai creme.</li>
    <li> I am a BZZ agent and received a sample of the glossing cream to try and review.  i have very thick hair with a wave underneath and highlights.  After using the shampoo/conditioner I tried this on wet and dry hair.  I felt it made my hair a little limp.  it did add a nice shine.  Perhaps I used too much.  I will keep trying to perfect it, as I do like the product and I do live in the south.  This will come in handy this summer I am sure!</li>
    <li> Finally I found hair cream that work well with my short hair. It made my hair looks healthy . It doesn&#x27;t get sticky when my hair got  wet by the rain or quick splash by  pool water from short water exercise.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but great for thin hair if you only use a pea-sized amount and focus on mid-shaft of hair (don&#x27;t put on the scalp or it may look greasy).  I also use on 2 children with very long hair and it works better than other items I&#x27;ve tried after hair washing to detangle their hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my little daughter who is only 4 1/2, who has straight and normally her hair is easy to manage, but when she gets out of the pool it is so hard to comb through.  Even after shampoo and good conditioner, her hair gets so dry from the chlorine.  When we tried this, her hair is such a breeze to get a comb through.  Thanks to this product we don&#x27;t have any more tears!</li>
    <li> Loved the product leaves my hair very soft and shiny, and the smell is wonderful also. Totally recommend this product to any one who likes to have soft, healthy, great smelling, shiny hair.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I noticed a difference in my hair the minute I started using it.  It puts a shine and softness in your hair.  I have curly hair and it has helped to define the curls as well.  Love it.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> I received a small sample of this Glossing Cream as part of a Buzz Campaign (I&#x27;m a Bzzzzz Agent--I love it!) and have been using it the last few weeks. You only need a pea-sized amount to work through your hair to make your hair feel sleek and shiny. Whenever I blow dry my hair, it gets incredibly poofy. This glossing cream helps so much! And I love that a little bit goes a long way. When I buy the 4-ounce tube, it&#x27;s only about $10 and it will last a long time. A great buy!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair which tends to get frizzy and appear dry.  The tiniest amount of this helps give shine and luster to my hair.  It&#x27;s the hair product I use after every shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love this glossing cream;a little goes a long way.You&#x27;ll only need a dime size amount to do the trick. Not only does it make my hair silky and smooth but it smells really nice. If you&#x27;re tired of dry(unhealthy)or dull hair.... you should add some life and shine to it with this cream.</li>
    <li> By far the best hair gloss I&#x27;ve comes across. A little expensive for the quality though. The shine is a little lack-luster. I&#x27;ve used gloss which though wasn&#x27;t as good in preventing the hair from frizzing had more shine to it.</li>
    <li> Item was purchased online cheaper than I could find anywhere locally. I truly love this product. It&#x27;s one of my all time favorites. I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and don&#x27;t intend on changing that anytime soon. Price was reasonable as well.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product to assist me in taming my unruly hair.  I would say it does a decent job of making my hair appear shinier, softer and had a mild clean scent.  Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t spectacular and for the price I paid, I expected a little more.  I probably will not repurchase this product.</li>
    <li> This is the worst purchase I have ever bought if you notice last review was 2010, and then 2006 theres a reason this is old product, I received it and the cream has separated oil and cream and it smell like motor oil.  I wonder how they get away with selling old stock, maybe they found it dumpster diving and now selling it on Amazon., I have asked for a return but have not yet received my refund.</li>
    <li> This cream really makes my hair soft. Great before straightening. My whole family uses it. It only takes a pea size amount. Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> Great to use prior to blow drying or straightening. Used best on damp hair prior to blow drying with barrel brush. I have also used it to get the silky smooth finish on hair prior to flat ironing. Cost is the same in Ulta, but the supplies are limited. Here, the shipping charges are null and comes straight to your door in 2 days.</li>
    <li> The main thing that I love about this hair cream is that it makes your hair look truly healthy and shiny without makinng it look GREASY. I rub it through my hair after I shampoo and condition my hair while it is still damp. Once my hair dries, it looks amazing! I absolutely love it.  I also tried argan oil and argan oil was a bit too heavy and oily, especially since my hair is pretty thin.  But this stuff just makes your hair look naturally soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful , it left my hair feeling soft and glossy. I am very pleased with it .</li>
    <li> I no longer use conditioner on days I&#x27;m using this product.  It&#x27;s a styling cream but also acts as a conditioner.  Smooth silky hair.</li>
    <li> It hydrates and makes my hair look years younger</li>
    <li> I have always admired Frederic Fekkai and his desire to make women feel beautiful. He is a master stylist. So, I was of course excited to try his new line of hair products.  The glossing cream has olive oil it. You know that makes me happy ( those who visit my website know I use olive oil for everything). The glossing cream promised to  hydrated my hair while restoring shine.I used it for about two weeks and loved the results. I&#x27;m currently growing out a perm and my hair is \\&quot;fuzzy\\&quot; or \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot;. It works like magic. A small, and I mean small, dollops will do. Just put it into the palm of your hands and rub. Then gently run your hands over your hair. It smells nice, works well and I had several compliments from my husband about my hair. Without letting out the secret I just smiled and quietly thanked Frederic. Copyright© KatherinesCorner.com-for Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I tried this glossing cream after reading positive reviews for it.  I love it!  It makes my hair shiny and easy to style!  The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars rather than 5 is because I didn&#x27;t like the smell.  The product smelled \\&quot;expired\\&quot; when I received it, so I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the normal smell of the stuff or if mine just sat in a hot mailbox for too long before arriving at my door. I did smell the glossing cream elsewhere and it smelled much better than the stuff I received.  I will purchase again and hope for a fresher product next time.</li>
    <li> I have really coarse hair and I spend a LOT of money on products in the ever elusive search to make my hair less &amp;#34;pubey&amp;#34; (sorry, that&#x27;s the best way to describe it!!)  This with either Fekkai Technician Glaze or Agave Oil Treatment work great together to make my hair soft and silky.  I would have given this one more star if I could use it alone, but I feel like I need an oil as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a pretty decent cream if you bought it from the store, but I&#x27;m thinking this seller is shipping off the old as dirt, leftover stuff. The container looked like it had been beaten up pretty good by the time it made it to me, and the cream smelled icky, it had lost all good smells that I&#x27;m sure it has when new. I&#x27;d say just don&#x27;t buy from this seller and you&#x27;ll probably have better luck.</li>
    <li> I having been using the shampoo, cream rinse and glossing cream for quite some time now as I used to order online from bath and body works (only place I could find it at the time).  These products do wonders for your hair.  I am so glad to see I can buy at other places now and use it daily on my hair.  Caution, if your hair is oily use a small amount of the glossing cream.  I wash my hair every other day so I don&#x27;t have a problem.  Friends I know wash every 2 days (dryer hair) and don&#x27;t have problems with their hair getting too oily............try these products.  You will love them and won&#x27;t believe how great your hair feels.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect to use have washing your hair to keep it smooth and silky.  It can used when your hair is wet or when it is dry to smooth hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s expensive to be sure, but it&#x27;s the best glossing hair cream product I&#x27;ve ever used.  It smells pleasant and clean and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair clumped or sticky.  A little dab will do you :)</li>
    <li> I have thick dry hair that gets frizzy and abused by hot rollers etc.  I have used this product and it does help with dry frizzy hair however I would not rate it much better than other less expensive silicone glossing creams on the market. You only need a little or your hair will be greasy.  I would rate this product 4 stars if it were not so expensive.  Really we are just paying for a name.</li>
    <li> I have problems with light, flyaway hair that also frizzes at the first drop of moisture in the air.  Use just a dab of this and smooth over your hair and it gives the hair an amazingly smooth, yet not greasy consistency.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Josie Maran Argan Oil works much better.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t really feel the effects of this product - a pity since there are so many good reviews about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I have naturally wavy Asian hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a while and it is just perfect for may type or hair. I love it and I recommend it</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and I wash it once a week. After I style my hair I put this magic glossing cream on my&lt;br /&gt;Hair and it looks beautiful.  When and if it rains my hair gets fly always and wavy. I just put the same PEA&lt;br /&gt;Size amount on and it fixes  the problem is solved . The best product I  have ever used</li>
    <li> Love the finishing gloss it gives to my hair highlights.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Use it on my permed curly hair when wet and when the frizzies start when dry. It was less expensive here than Ulta!</li>
    <li> I have super long, super thick wavy/curly hair, and I LOVE THIS STUFF. I part my hair in the middle while its still wet, and use a pea-sized amount on each half (from about my ears down... I don&#x27;t wanna test it out any higher up). It adds a bit of shine without making my hair look greasy or stiff, helps control frizz if I let it dry naturally, and works fabulously when I blow dry. It&#x27;s pricey, but one container seems to be lasting a very long time.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff. She claims it makes her hair shiny and easy to manage. I like to make my wife happy. :) I wasn&#x27;t able to find a large tube of this stuff locally, so I began looking online. Amazon had the largest tube size at the lowest price, two wins in my book. It was delivered quickly and well packaged.</li>
    <li> Use sparingly after drying and styling your hair and it will give you a glossy shine.  Only a pea size amount (seriously) and rub it together between your hands and then apply sparingly.  Looks great on my blondish brown hair and if you have frizzies will smooth them down.  Lasts a very long time - and I&#x27;ve had my last tube for over a year (remember you only need a pea sized amount)..</li>
    <li> Hands down best frizz product I&#x27;ve ever used. I work in beauty supplies and have very thick, curly hair (3b). I&#x27;ve wasted hundreds of dollars on failed products. Well worth the money for this one. The bottle is small, but you do honestly only need a little amount to get good results.</li>
    <li> I have re-ordered the Fekkai Glossing Cream several times.  A little goes a long way.  Really, just a pea-sized blob cuts down frizz but does not make my hair feel coated or weighed down.</li>
    <li> I have uses Fekaii glossing creme for the past five years.  This creme makes my hair look smooth and shiny so it creates a healthy look for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It eliminates any frizz in my hair which is great as I live in a humid area. It lasts a long time as you only need a little bit too.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this product. It does nothing that it claims to do. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product of all time. My hair loves it. You use a tiny amount and it makes your hair luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;Last forever justifying the price.</li>
    <li> I have thick, dry, frizzy hair &amp; this helps it immensely!  I am so happy I found this product; it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found to help control it.</li>
    <li> I will never switch to anything else- I&#x27;ve been using this since high school! I started using other products a few years ago and switched to this stuff again recently. I forgot how amazing it makes my hair look- better than anything else i&#x27;ve ever tried. And I&#x27;ve tried a lot! I have fine, thick, wavy hair that looks a little frizzy and unruly on its own. If I use this stuff before blow drying my hair I notice such a difference.</li>
    <li> I love this hair product. They took it from me at the Bogota airport as I was foolish enough to leave it in my carry on.  I immediately sat down in the airport and ordered more!</li>
    <li> 5points for the great product. Its smootie and make my dick hair softer. I have a great feeling when i using this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it every day. It makes my hair soft, shiny and so smooth. I carry a tube in my purse. It&#x27;s the best!!</li>
    <li> I did not like this product.  I have thick, slightly curly hair and it left my hair weighed down and feeling like it has a film or build up on it.  Definitely not clean and touchable.  I only used a pea sized amount as the directions stated, but I just did not like the way the product feels on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have a perm and it nicely manages that. I would purchase it again. Seems to give a little shine.</li>
    <li> I have colored (bleached) my hair for years and left my hair dry and fly a-way. I received a sample in the mail several years ago and it has changed my life. My hair not only looks great but also leaves it shiny. Each person needs to try different small amounts to learn what works for you.</li>
    <li> Nice product but made my hair too limp. Passed it off to my daughter.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if the product I received was expired but smelled super bad as old oil i&#x27;m very disappointed with what I have received</li>
    <li> Hubby had flakes from being in the hosp.  Had tried other products and they did not work.  This one did, and not&lt;br /&gt;only did it work, his hair is losing the silver.  wow</li>
    <li> I am using Fekkai Glossing Cream for 2 years and can&#x27;t live without it. I have a gray hair and without this product it looks very dull but after I put very little of this product on my hair it shines like silver. Love it!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this on the strength of other reviews without reading the ingredient list. This is virtually all silicone, which is both greasy and heavy like motor oil, so of course it smooths the hair and makes it shiny. It also makes it so greasy that you can feel the grease on your forehead and ears and cannot put sunglasses up on top of your head. I have curly hair and this is just awful for it. Also be aware that silicone, if used daily without anything actually moisturizing between, will dry your hair out terribly and leave it in worse shape. So then you won&#x27;t be able to wear your hair without a product like this. By the way, there are much cheaper silicone-based glossing products sold at Walmart that do exactly the same thing for less than a tenth of the price.</li>
    <li> Love this glossing cream!</li>
    <li> My hair dresser suggested I use \\&quot;product\\&quot; in my hair and recommended glossing creme but of course all the products in her salon cost a fortune.  After a little research into glossing cremes, I came across this one and recalled that Martha Stewart is a fan of this line of product so I figured why not?  My hair is dry and course and has been losing its shine as I&#x27;ve gotten older but this creme has definitely added some back. I use this on a daily basis now and am happy with it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product as it is perfect for my thick, coarse hair--makes it manageable, soft, and so shiny. Since it&#x27;s rather expensive, I&#x27;m always looking for deals on it and this is the best I have found so far. The 7 oz is typically $25 at such stores as Target and Walgreens. To find it under subscribe and save for just $14 just made my day. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have time to style my hair everyday and I have dry hair, so this product helps my hair look like I actually did something to it and it makes it feel softer.</li>
    <li> I love this glossing product. I put it on damp hair and them style. My hair shines and is very soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a whole year, and it&#x27;s a great cosmetic hair product since it leaves tiny, subtle glittering particles on your hair. I&#x27;ve got better moisturizing product. It&#x27;s expensive, but since I don&#x27;t really need it desperately, a tiny amount each time makes 4 oz lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major component of this product is silicone, so it&#x27;s good in helping to prevent frizzling hair in winter times. I used to carry a small one in my bag, just to solve the annoying \\&quot;crazy flying hair all over your face\\&quot; condition in winter months...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have fine hair, this could be too heavy for you. I got straight, long hair and this cream weights my hair down. So I use only a tiny amount on the end of my hair, mostly for its glittering particles instead of the moisturizing effect. But my friend who has coarse, wavy &amp; curly hair loves this. For those who find it too heavy, you can try to put it on when your hair is damp. It&#x27;s not gonna hold any shape but will be less greasy when your hair dries.</li>
    <li> Our local Target carries this line, but it is on average $3-4 more expensive there.  This is probably one of my favorite stying products.  Smells good and is lightweight, yet does a good job of smoothing and taming.  Also, while it is not cheap, it does seem to last a long time - as a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Got this item for my mom last year and she loves it and has been using it since.  It gives her hair more body and her hair looks great and healthier!</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I use this item and love it and it makes your hair shine and keeps if from looking dry</li>
    <li> Works amazing and makes my hair nice and silky</li>
    <li> I like the softness of this.  Hair feels natural, not stiff like a mousse will make it.  Doesnt look greasy.</li>
    <li> This really helps my hair look much shiner and healthier and SMOOTH!  I woman at work actually told me she had a hair crush on my hair! :)</li>
    <li> I have curly hair but sometimes straighten it and I use this after I straighten it to make it smoother, softer and shinier.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this I thought I was getting the &amp;#34;Smooth&amp;#34; by Fekkai but ended up with the Glossing Cream.  However, I went ahead and tried it and I do like it.  It keeps friz down well.  I still prefer the &amp;#34;Smooth&amp;#34; but this product is good, too.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this because so many reviewers love it. My hair is wavy/curly 2B - 2C, depending on the cut and the styling products. I have a lot of hair, but the texture is fine. This product probably would work with coarse hair, but it made my curls CRUNCHY and I hate that. I&#x27;m a licensed hairdresser, so I found the Deva line in a \\&quot;professionals only\\&quot; store. I bought the Deva Curl Cream, which I love. Bottom line, do not buy if you have fine, curly hair and you hate CRUNCH...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</li>
    <li> I have fine curly AND oily hair. Been using this for over 3 years now. Love everything about it and no \\&quot;crunch\\&quot; as another reviewer experienced. Every person is different and nothing is going to work the same on everyone. You will not know for sure until you try it. My daughter convinced me to give it a shot. I was hooked after the very first application. You really DO only need a small amount. My hair drinks it right up. No sign of residue or greasiness.</li>
    <li> I did not get what I had ordered ~ its okay, but wish I would have gotten what I wanted.  Now I am stuck with this.</li>
    <li> The best glosser and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  I buy the larger sizes now, but this stuff lasts a long long time as a tiny bit goes a long ways.  Highly recommend this unless you have oily hair.  Mine is normal to a little bit dry in sun or high heat in winter.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this as much as I  thought I would, it is very much a thickening cream and that is the last thing my already dense, pouffy hair needs.</li>
    <li> I could not live without this wonderful glossing cream....makes unruly ends silky soft! I have bought it many times but was a good deal here...so bought 3 more!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It does the trick.. just towel dry your hair, put some in the ends and blow dry. It doesnt make your hair sticky or oily, but makes it more manageable. The trick is to use the right amount. Smells good too!</li>
    <li> This works great to tame your hair and really leaves it soft and silky. Be careful to not apply too much or your hair may look greasy. Avoid placing on roots. Try it, you&#x27;ll love it! I use two small dabs, about the size of pea, for each dab. One of the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Works great as a leave-in or as an after product for smoothing out frizzies. Nice light cleanish earth scent. Hard to describe but not herbal. Leaves hair smooth and not greasy. Use only a tiny bit.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hip length hair sleek and conditioned. It&#x27;s a keeper, especially in the winter when the extra moisturizing is needed!</li>
    <li> My husband has wonderful thick wavy hair.  He will only use this glossing cream.  He loves the results, smoothes out the frizz and leaves a nice shine.</li>
    <li> The product smells good (not too perfumey, which I hate) and has a nice feel. However, I have naturally curly, baby-fine hair that gets really flat in the winter, and it is a little too heavy for my hair, even just using a tiny bit. I think it would be excellent for someone with coarser, curlier hair. It does give a nice gloss,but weighs my hair down too much.</li>
    <li> I got a little sample tube of this with their shampoo/conditioner (which I love!). Gave it a try and had to wash it out. I only used a pea sized drop (I have a chin length bob) and it made my hair greasy. I think this product is just too heavy for my fine, straight hair. Think my niece, who has thick, curly hair, will enjoy it, though!</li>
    <li> I have only used the product a couple times but it leaves my hair feeling greasy and if I run my hands through my hair, my hands feel greasy as well. I have thick hair and haven&#x27;t had this issue with other products (leave in conditioners). It may be that I need to adjust the amount I put in and how I dispense it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED!!!! (NEW) I must have used this product on a bad hair day. I use this a few times a week when I know that I need a little extra support for my hair (long hour work days) and I use about a dime-size amount and it no longer feels greasy</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with Fekkai Glossing Cream!  I have spent hundreds of dollars trying to find products to tame my wavy frizzy hair, and this stuff is the first product to give me any kind of success.  While it is more money than I prefer to spend on my hair products and is not a cure-all (I still have to use other hair products), it is totally worth it. After using this cream for about a month, I fully intend on purchasing more when my current supply runs out.  I highly recommend this product for those with thick, wavy, naturally frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is relaxed and color treated. I decided to give this product a try after using several hundreds of dollars of products for smoothing on my hair. Although I relax my hair I still has a \\&quot;fine\\&quot; grade of hair, it doesn&#x27;t take much to weigh my hair down. This product smooths the hair, but I still found myself needing moisture. I mixed this product along with my argan oil and it worked great.</li>
    <li> I have never gotten compliments on my hair, but each of the 5 times I&#x27;ve used this I have been given compliments. I wash, mouse, dry the hair, put a dime-sized amount in my hands, rub is all over my hands, comb it with my fingers from the middle of the head down to the ends and then curl with hot rollers. The end result is shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff it makes my hair so soft &amp; shiney, would recommend it. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t get enough of this cream.  Normally I don&#x27;t spend tons of money on hair products, but this is one product I&#x27;m willing to spend the money on.  I got a free sample of this a couple years ago and I fell in love with it.  You use a very small amount (pea size) and it makes your hair so soft and shiny and it smells amazing.  I can really tell a drastic difference in my hair when I do not use this cream, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this, gives my hair a shine without greasy look. Awesome product being using for years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> This stuff really helps my hair which is naturally curly and very very dry.  It really cuts the frizz too.</li>
    <li> Did nothing to my hair. I&#x27;m Caucasian with slightly wavy, dark brown hair.</li>
    <li> Pricey!! IT is a pity</li>
    <li> Love this hair cream.  Living in south Florida this product applied to damp hair prior to drying and styling is a lifesaver.  Frizz no more! :)</li>
    <li> This is my second Fekkai glossing cream purchase on Amazon.  This cream does not weigh my hair down and it controls the frizz.  I would recommend this product.</li>
