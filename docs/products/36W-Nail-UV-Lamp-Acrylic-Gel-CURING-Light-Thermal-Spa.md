      <li>This works great and hasn&#x27;t given me any problems so far.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This lamp is perfect. Works perfectly (and I have been using it for almost a year now) with no trouble. I love that I can manage both hands at once, cuts the process time WAY down. Great mani. Great product, great price. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This lamp is a tad bit large but I can fit both hands in easily and if I was to gel my toenails I am sure both feet would fit in easily as well.  Lamp works great is easy to use although I do wish it had a timer but I can deal.  So nice to be able to gel manicure at home my nails have a hard time growing and I can&#x27;t afford the salon every other week this has been a savior.</li>
    <li> The lamps go in and out on occassions, otherwise when the light is on, it works</li>
    <li> I received the machine quickly and in good shape.  It works very well.  I use it with the Gelish polishes.  Cures the polish faster than the uv light I bought at Sallys.</li>
    <li> I rarely put on nail polish nor do I have the time to have a manicure or pedicure and I only go to the nail salon when there is a special occasion.  Regular nail polish do not last on my nails since I do a lot of work using my hands. I decided to try shellac by CND and of course I had to purchase a light curing machine to set the shellac. I chose this brand based on the earlier good reviews and the pricing. I am glad I did.  This is the first time I tried shellac and it had been almost two weeks and my manicure and pedicure still look awesome, shiny and intact.  No chipping at all!&lt;br /&gt;The only minor problem I had this with this machine is that it was a little bit difficult to snap the UV light bulbs in place.  If you do not insert the bulbs all the way through, then the light will not turn on and your polish will not set.  Make sure that both light bulbs are securely placed all the way through the receptacles, otherwise, an incompletely cured polish will remain tacky and will not set.&lt;br /&gt;However, once the bulbs are securely in place, you are all set to go! It does not have any timer so you will need to have your own timer or stopwatch to set the base coat for 10 seconds, and the shellac color and top coats for 2 minutes each coating. This machine is large enough to fit two hands at a time, if you want to save time. But in my case, I only cured the shellac one hand at a time, one foot at a time.  Now, with the longevity of the bulbs, I can&#x27;t say how long the bulbs would last but I hope they last a long long time.  The first thing I did, after using the shellac polish on my fingernails and toenails, was to give away all my regular nail polish bottles. I will never go back to regular polish again! This machine works and imagine all the money you will save if you just do your manicure and pedicure at home! If you do all steps correctly then the shellac polish should stay on nice and pretty for two weeks.</li>
    <li> the lights do not stay on, I would not recommend this item.  To fix or replace cost as much as the unit!</li>
    <li> I just received my thermal spa double size UV light.  I heard reviews about the Shellac nail system from friends.  I researched online how to do it myself, and figured it was would be simple enough to do it myself!  And sure enough... IT IS!!!  I JUST now finished painting my nails and i&#x27;m typing this review with perfectly DRY nails!  I researched online how to apply shellac step by step and followed the instructions... I can already tell I am going to love this.  You dont need to spend $200+ on a CND light.. this light works.. it cured my nails each step.  Don&#x27;t forget to wipe your nails with alcohol to get the tacky stuff off at the end of the last step!</li>
    <li> Pros: Works great with Shellac (I am a professional, but did not want to buy the CND light for the money). The size of the lamp is perfect for manicures and pedicures.    Cons: There is no timer, but watching a clock really is not that hard. The lamp gets really hot, so I bought a small fan to place next to the lamp while doing a mani/pedi combo.     Very happy with this lamp!</li>
    <li> This UV light was definitely worth the investment.  I have already made the return on my investment.  This light works very well with the CND gel polish.  I apply three coats and the take off is very easy, so if you are looking for the ultimate manicure, this is it.  You will pay at least 35 dollars in the salon, SO PLEASE PURCHASE !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This curing lamp is so handy.... and easy to use. It has automatic on and shutoff. I can fit my whole hand or foot into it, and don&#x27;t have to do my thumbs separately, like with my smaller unit. I am happy to have this item, and the price was right when I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I am really glad I got this item,it is really easy to use.  It will pay for its self in in 2 months</li>
    <li> This is excellent for anyone who uses gel nail polishes.  Gels tend to take much longer to dry than your average nail polishes.  This reduces the dry time so you can start getting things done again.</li>
    <li> This lamp fits two hands comfortably. If you&#x27;re as clumsy as I am, you&#x27;re going to need the large opening that this lamp provides. It comes with 2 bulbs and a detachable power cord. It cures any uv gel. The price is worth it. It&#x27;s a high quality lamp. It does not have a timer but I&#x27;m pretty sure your fancy cellphone that is attached to your body at all times has a timer you can use. If you notice a burning feeling, its the gel that is touching your skin as its curing. SO remove it before you put your tootsies in the lamp.</li>
    <li> Although I think if I could go back I would buy the CND lamp just for the convenience of the timer and it already knows what times you need to cure your shellac for, but this product is good and works.  I guess I would just buy the CND because I&#x27;m lazy... Right now I am figuring out the best times with this lamp to cure the shellac so it doesnt bubble or cure for too long (which makes it last not as long)  Right now I cure the base for 40 seconds the color coats for 3 minutes and same with top coat 3 minutes. The lamp works I have no issues with it its very big so if I ever decide to do my feet it will be quite easy.  Also I would suggest to put sunscreen on your hands when you do this, it can get a little warm.</li>
    <li> I bought this to do at home mani/pedicures. My boyfriend has size 13 feet and even his toes fit without problem. The UV lights work well so far, the machine is spacious and it&#x27;s a great value. It doesn&#x27;t cure as fast as the 40W, but it&#x27;s excellent as it is (and far better than the portable UV lamps). It pays for itself in one pedicure.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing lamp! I love to do my nails and my daughter&#x27;s nails too. This lamp cures gelish quickly. Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this lamp! It works great and its big enough to fit both hands or feet! Love love love it! Im saving a bunch by not having to go to the salon to get my nails/toes done!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m def not one to write reviews, however before purchasing a product I research &amp; read &amp; research some more. There were very limited reviews maybe 2 or 3 for this product but I ordered it anyway. I ordered this product for my sister as a christmas gift.She loves doing her nails pretty often (at least once a week) I was looking for a product that they similarly use in the nail salons to dry your nails.She used the dryer tonight for the first time. I don&#x27;t find it to be noisy(some may tho). However, I do find that it was well worth the price. Item literally came the day before christmas (christmas eve) and she and I are pleasantly surprised. The u/v light sets the nails after the fan dries them. So me &amp; her are curious to see if her manicure last longer (which it should) than when she lets it air dry.  Again great buy (for personal or professional use).</li>
    <li> I have tried to do 3 shellac manicures with this lamp.  It does not come with instructions so I have had to read the reviews several times as I continue to make mistakes.  Thank goodness for great Amazon customers.  The timing  is important to curing everything.  I still do not have that down pat and manage to mess the nails up when cleaning off on the final step.  Even after curing you have to let them set for about 10 minutes.  There is no timer on this machine so make sure you have your cell handy.  I watched several videos also but it really boiling down to the curing time.  The price was great so I would buy it again.  Watch video for simple tricks like never shake you shellac bottles.  Yes, it does last 2 weeks, just educate yourself first.</li>
    <li> Great product. This was the first time I ever bought a nairl curing light and didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time perfectly protected and as described. I used it today for the first time with my OPI gel base coat, gel color, and gel top coat that I also ordered from Amazon. It is easy to use and delivered perfect results! I set a timer on my phone for 30 seconds to cure each gel coat and then manually switched off the light since it is automatically set for 2 minutes but that didn&#x27;t bother me. I am so excited that I won&#x27;t be wasting any more money getting the same gel mani and pedi at a nail salon that I can do for myself at home now!  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I have been waiting for their response for two months. The equipment broke in the first 5-1/2 weeks of owning it. The nail polish lasts 2-3 weeks, so it was broken on my 3rd attempt to use it. When I contacted Amazon, the seller Beauty 21, said that my time to return the item has passed but to investigate my year long warranty. I hope they do not SCAM anyone else.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my wife. It dried her nails properly. There is alot of plastic on this item and does feel a bit flimsy. So far we have had no issues.</li>
    <li> My wife was so disappointed with this dryer. Her gel polish never got dry. This item was very expensive as well</li>
    <li> item did not cure uv light was not of proper frequincy to properly cure the gel. Stay away from this manufacturer</li>
    <li> I bought this light for my first time doing gel nails at home. It&#x27;s a great curing light and it works fast, but I think an LED curing lamp would be better. I get worried about using the UV on my skin once a week or so.</li>
    <li> This is a great lamp. My only issue is that one of the bulbs tends to loosen and you have to push it back in before each use. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great lamp with a ton of space!! Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> This light is A OK!!  I love the size.  Was a quick shipment.  I would recommend this to others and I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love that you can fit both hands in but wish they made it more clear that that it doesn&#x27;t come with the necessary bulbs. No beauty supply store here carries 18w lights so had to order that after I got the lamp. Otherwise it should be fine.</li>
    <li> Well would the money if you schlack your nails.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I love the UV lamp. Nails cure pretty well</li>
    <li> Works great! My nails look awesome! I would recommend this product! Both feet fit in it for a faster pedicure</li>
    <li> I only wish it had a timer on it</li>
    <li> This is a great lamp for gel nails. The only downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t have a timer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this light using Shellac at  home since early December.  I use it every two weeks and have no problems with my nails looking just as great as they do at the salon.  If you can paint your fingernails you can Shellac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lamp comes with the bulbs (remember to use tissues when putting them in so as not to get fingerprints on the bulbs); is two handed; could work for a pedicure just fine; and has either a two-minute, three-minute, or continuous setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shellac on ladies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  For some reason the product featured keeps changing.  When I purchased it was the two-handed, self timing model. As the comments noted then it changed to the two-handed, non timed model. Now it seems to be showing a one-handed model.  BE CAREFUL and ensure you&#x27;re buying the one you want!</li>
    <li> This is a very big lamp, will easily fit 2 hands or 2 feet at the same time. There is no timer, just an on/off switch. Bulbs are in the bottom of the shipping box beneath the lamp.     I bought this to use with CND Shellac and it works. You do not need to purchase the CND brand lamp! However, non-CND lamps take longer to cure Shellac. Using this lamp I do 30 seconds to 1 min. for the base coat and then 2 minutes for each additional coat. At first I was scared it wasn&#x27;t working because my nails were still what other people call \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; but to me they felt more than tacky, simply wet! But just keep going with putting on the coats and curing with the lamp and then use alcohol on a pad to instantly get rid of the tackiness. CND says to use 99% alcohol but CVS Pharmacy only had 91% and it works perfectly. The shine is amazing and doesn&#x27;t dull even when I use lotion or have soap scum on my nails.    I highly recommend Shellac. I was a bit scared because I had read people&#x27;s comments saying that if you got any on your cuticles it would all peel off and I&#x27;m not a perfect painter at all. The results are that several of my nails are not as neat as I&#x27;d like but there is no chipping so far. I&#x27;m on day 4 and have spent a lot of time swimming and doing child care. Regular polish would be chipping off by now. I am thrilled!    I think the goal of application is to make the coat as thin and even as you can. Since this is a gel it feels totally different and a bit thicker than paint. It almost has some \\&quot;give\\&quot; to it like plastic but in spite of that it is tough.</li>
    <li> I really like this lamp is not only that cures really good its also that both hands can feet really well without touching each other which is so good cause you don&#x27;t need to have two lamps .</li>
    <li> I love it! Its large enough for hands or feet! Cord is removable for easy storage and the top has a little handle for moving. Cleans up great with a cotton ball and alcohol.</li>
    <li> This is an easy to use, roomy but portable light.  Cures nails fast &amp; is a great value for the price.  Nails look professionally done every time.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very delicate due to the bulbs. I handle it like fine China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works just as good as if I were getting my nails done at a salon--it just takes longer. Probably about 3-4 minutes per coat instead of 1-2 minutes. But, I can&#x27;t complain because it&#x27;s a fraction of the cost!</li>
    <li> Very big lamp that can fit both hands at once. Great starter lamp but I would wear sunscreen on your hands if your going to be using it often. I will be upgrading to a LED lamp. I didnt give a 5 star rating because my front bulb sometimes comes lose and will not light. I have to hold it in place for a few seconds to get it to stick and stay lit.</li>
    <li> Why did i wait so long to purchase this lamp? It cure regular nail polish and shellac, it makes it dry so much faster. Five stars!</li>
    <li> Its exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> It has definitely earned its keep.</li>
    <li> Im not inlove with this particular lamp, it requires longer set times and my nails are still a bit tacky after 15 minutes, but if you have time and patients then it&#x27;s ok I guess..</li>
    <li> Wish I didn&#x27;t buy it. it did not dry the gel polish at all. I&#x27;m so disappointed. Complete waste of money!!!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hands hot and I love that it is big enough to do two hands at the same time.</li>
    <li> I put the two provided UV bulbs in the lamp and got started only to find three-quarters of the way through the entire application that the reason my nails were tacky after waiting double the time under the lights was because one of the bulbs was blown.  I don&#x27;t know if this happened from my installation or if they came that way.  Despite that disappointment, my nails turned out okay. Everything else is as described. Hopefully, my replacement bulb will last a little longer than the original bulb.</li>
    <li> I used this lamp the first day i recieved my package. I was eager to try my first at home gel nails. The lamps fall out by themselves. When i put one in the other falls out. When it is upright one of the lights dont work, so i have to flip it upside down along with my palm to get my nails to dry. Maybe its the bulbs?</li>
    <li> I never ever write reviews but I am because i was unsure of this product but I really enjoy it and it works well!</li>
    <li> it was a gift, works good. so far I have not heard any complaints about it. so far so good</li>
    <li> works like a champ! great for doing hands AND toes!!!! I have had it for over 6 months? and the lamps are still working :) heats up really fast and doesnt take long to cure gel/shellac.</li>
    <li> This is a great UV Lamp. I use it for glitter toes and you can fit both feet in with room to spare! Well worth the money, great price too!</li>
    <li> This is a nice UV lamp. Big enough to fit both hands or feet-I haven&#x27;t had it for long and will update after a couple months.</li>
    <li> Works well with no problems. I should have thought about getting one with a timer. That&#x27;s an easy fix though....I just set the timer on my phone.</li>
    <li> This light is perfect for gel polish. Easy to use! 2 minutes between each coat is long enough to cure the polish and I love that I can do both hands at one time.</li>
    <li> Really big. I like the size</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister she going to school to learn how to do nails,  cause the school gave her the small one just for one hand at a time so I got her this one for 2 hands she doing her thing now.</li>
    <li> it arived in two days wich was great i odered it for chelloc did not even dried my nails in 1 hour!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! workes good only on regular nail polish, wich i did not bey this for, very disapointed.</li>
    <li> I love this UV Lamp. Its bigger than what i thought it was going to be and the bulbs were easy to install. I would recommend this lamp to everyone.</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect about this product. I&#x27;m amazed how well it works everytime I use it!! Thanks for an amazing purchase and super fast shipping</li>
    <li> This works perfectly. Easy to put together (just insert bulbs, voila) and do your gel nails in the comfort of your home!  I poured a glass of wine and put on a TV show - total breeze!</li>
    <li> I kept watching this item and going back and forth about the reviews but I ordered it and I absolutely love it.  It came with bulbs and has worked great.</li>
    <li> This works great and hasn&#x27;t given me any problems so far. I&#x27;m very satisfied. The only thing that might be an issue for some people is having to time yourself, because the lamp doesn&#x27;t have a timer on it. I don&#x27;t mind it at all, though, I&#x27;m fine counting the seconds in my head!&lt;br /&gt;All in all, love it.</li>
    <li> Would have liked to have had a fan. Otherwise is great</li>
    <li> I love this thing. It&#x27;s the perfect price, it couldn&#x27;t have been easier to assemble (just pop in two lights, no instructions really needed) and plug it in! I&#x27;ve worked with the CND one before too and this is the same, without the timer. Love it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this curing light because of the good reviews and price.  I am not happy with it at all.  The lights are difficult to install and the far right-hand light does not stay lighted.  I have tried changing lights without success.  As a results, the curing of the shellac is uneven and tends to peel.  I had hopes of avoiding going to the salon for a manicure, but I am having to do my nails more often at home.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a 36W UV Lamp to use at home.  This lamp exceeds my expectations.  I&#x27;m not particularly dainty, so the large, 2-hand opening is perfect for me.  The fan feature is a great upgrade.  The bulbs that came with the lamp were very easy to install and I was up and running within minutes.</li>
    <li> it doent dry my nails already smudged and had them in there for over 5 minutes each hand ,still tacky.  I dont understand how the reviews on this machine are so different</li>
    <li> This is just like the ones they use in the salon.  At first I thought it was really big, but then I realized if I put it on the floor I could do a shellac pedicure.  Both my feet fit comfortably inside.  I am a size 10 US women&#x27;s.  great buy i have recommended this to others.</li>
    <li> U literally pop the bulbs in and plug it in its so easy I love it and it fits both hands comfortably u can even fit both feet too. It has an easy on off switch on the top of it the only thing it doesn&#x27;t have is a timer but so worth the money</li>
    <li> Love being able to paint gel colors at home.  Nicely packaged, arrive promptly.  Would prefer to have a timer on the light instead of an on/off switch.</li>
    <li> My daughter received the 36W Nail UV Lamp Acrylic Gel CURING Light Thermal Spa. She said it seemed to be pretty nice, so far. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Light switch does not work so good,light does not dire so well.</li>
    <li> This works well and is bigger than I anticipated.  It seems like the ones in the nail salon dry better and that could be my imagination but it is sufficient.  Be sure to let your nails set after using this for awhile as they will smudge. I keep my nails inside the dryer for 10-15 minutes.  Lots of room for toes too.</li>
    <li> This came with the bulbs packaged securely in the end of the box, be careful when opening. All you need to do to install is slide them in where contacts meet. EZ PZ!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It&#x27;s much better than using enamel nail polish.  I would recommend it highly to anyone who does their nails at home!</li>
    <li> Perfect for both hands.  I don&#x27;t want to do one hand at a time. I have limited time for myself so I wanted a lamp to use for both hands for curing the shellac polish from CND</li>
    <li> This works just like the salon version...it may be the salon version....cures gel nails perfectly.  I find that staying under the lamp 3 minutes on the top coat works best.  It does not have a timer so you need a separate timer or I would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Works, but would be best to buy one with a fan. Doesn&#x27;t dry very well and then gets hot and melts the shellac.</li>
    <li> I just bought this item and I&#x27;m using it with the Gelish soak off line, but maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong after I put the top coat I let it cure for 2-3 min it&#x27;s &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; I get that&#x27;s normal I then rub it with the alcohol and the gel shine turn opaque and it still feels kinda wet where if I put my finger over it it will leave a finger print. Anyone else have this problem??</li>
    <li> Funny, but my manicures with this product do not seem to last as long as the ones done using my cheap handheld light.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t cure gel.  Was still sticky even long after recommended time.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use it until I figure out where to get a power cord :-( I wish I spent the extra money and bought one at the beauty store.</li>
    <li> The inner lamps always detach, I have to constantly adjust them in order for them to work&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the product works, it&#x27;s just an average quality</li>
    <li> I followed dry times on each of the products I used. This worked very well. It takes less time to do my nails myself than going to a salon.</li>
    <li> The price on this was great- looks just like the one that my nail technician uses when I go in.  I am a licensed beautician and for a little more than the cost of a gel manicure at a salon I purchased this light.  Now I do my own nails at home.  Great light!</li>
    <li> Works as well as the salon!</li>
    <li> no complaints here! Works great, I had to buy a new one because I bought another one without reading the reviews that said a lot of people got the uv lamp but it didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m glad this one did, even if I had to pay a little more.</li>
    <li> Great for doing your nails at home.</li>
    <li> I had not been happy with the product packaging and instructions.  I called them and they explained how to use it and were sorry for the packaging.  My main concern was that the machine was in working condition and it was not damaged. It was fine. I have used it several times and I love it.  They were very accommodating.  I would buy from them again.</li>
    <li> Does not cure the nails, at all.  I was so excited to be able to save money and do my own gel and shellac nails at home and was very dissapointed when I used this and kept my nails to cure in there longer than 2 min and they still werent dry, so I stuck them in there for another 2 minutes and another two, so on and so forth and they still came out and smudged.</li>
