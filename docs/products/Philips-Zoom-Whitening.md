      <li>Can cause sensitivity, just easy off on the time exposure.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Previous treatments using the same treatment have been more successful (bought from your website).&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
      <li>Has done great at keeping my teeth pearly white!!</li>
      <li>My dentist made plastic trays for me that fit my teeth.  </li>
      <li>and they said they bought out the original NiteWhite.  </li>
      <li>I kept the solution on for 2 hours on 3 separate nights and the results are good enough that I still haven&#x27;t finished the whitening gel.</li>
      <li>i have been a non smoker for around 3 months now so as a reward i decided to go to my dentist and treat myself to teeth whitening, i paid in full</li>
      <li>I am a dental nurse and work at a dentist, this is the proper stuff and works amazingly with custom made whitening trays.</li>
      <li>The product seem fresh.</li>
      <li>but I have gotten better gels from other supplies at better pricing.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping.great product</li>
      <li>I ordered the 22% I love it find myself wanting to whitening my teeth every night but the only problem it irritates my gums</li>
      <li>Arrived exactly as stated.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with this product, you do get results and mine is only 16%, so</li>
      <li>I just started my second three pak (for maintenance) and my teeth look much better.</li>
      <li>I admit I used too much on my first try but afterwards used it sparingly.</li>
      <li>Expensive, but awesome results.</li>
      <li>But it definitely works and I will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>ABSOLUTELY!</li>
      <li>Love that I can purchase this online (lasts for a LONG time) instead of forking out hundreds of dollars at the dental office!</li>
      <li>did I really use anything?</li>
      <li>Whittens fast.</li>
      <li>Did everything I expected and more.</li>
      <li>and I saved $450.00 that is how much my dentist wanted to whiten my teeth.</li>
      <li>their instructions are for much longer but I would be reluctant to leave it on for longer than 1 hour.</li>
      <li>My first batch was the exact same brand and strength that I got from my dentist</li>
      <li>DO NOT be fooled into buying the older, expired</li>
      <li>It made my teeth hair-raisingly sensitive!!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product, even for sensitive gums like mine.</li>
      <li>This is the same product in a higher percentage than my dentist was selling to me, and at a lower cost.  </li>
      <li>It is EXACTLY the same.</li>
      <li>so i thought i&#x27;d look on the net to see if it was a dental product or available for the general public to buy</li>
      <li>I use in conjunction with a little LED light.</li>
      <li>Use with toothpaste for sensitive teeth.  </li>
      <li>I contacted Phillips Zoom directly</li>
      <li>It was all a waste of money, $300 to be exact considering everything.</li>
      <li>which was £290, the trays were moulded exactly to match my teeth which took a few days to be returned to the dentist, ive had 2 treatments at the dentist and then told i take the trays home and do it myself until the required whiteness is achieved, when i was given the pack to take home</li>

<li> you order from someone other than Express Health, check the expiration date and the new white and black packaging!  </li>
<li> Then, I let the trays dry and store them in the container my dentist provided.  </li>
<li> Half the price and same product I buy from dentist.</li>
<li> the moral of this review is, dont go to your dentist to have this teeth whitening done, just buy this for a alot less</li>
<li> Item arrived sooner than expected, which of course is a plus.</li>
<li> This item is just as expected.</li>
<li> Not real stuff.  </li>
<li> ive been a heavy smoker for the last 20 years, however ive always looked after my teeth, i use a sonicare electric toothbrush and the whitening gel pens which dont make my teeth any whiter but kept the stains away.</li>
<li> I tried other brands</li>
<li> same as suggested by my dentist only less expensive</li>
<li> Less than one hour application recommended</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> you don&#x27;t waste any.</li>
<li> I have purchased this in the past from my dentist.  </li>
<li> Have used Zoom in the past and decided to try this product.  </li>
<li> Just fyi, other products by SmileMedic have been reported to be tampered with; one apparently made some woman and her husband sick.</li>
<li> To buy further syringes from my dentist was very expensive.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Did everything I expected and more.</li>
    <li> good price for authentic product</li>
    <li> Works just as good as the stuff I buy at the dentist that&#x27;s more expensive.</li>
    <li> It definitely worked. It made my teeth hair-raisingly sensitive!! My first batch was the exact same brand and strength that I got from my dentist but it did not make my teeth ache. I saw this online and figured it was a good price so I would try it. Good price, product works...no pain no gain!</li>
    <li> Just like at the dentists&#x27; office... but cheaper</li>
    <li> Used as directed and I saved $450.00 that is how much my dentist wanted to whiten my teeth. I went to Amazon, read the reviews,&lt;br /&gt;ordered what I needed now people stop me and ask, MY God what have you done, you look great.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;PS Follow directions, do not deviate remember you are dealing with chemicals.</li>
    <li> It Is the best Product on the Market... My teeth are White as can be........</li>
    <li> Have used Zoom in the past and decided to try this product.  Even though it said 22%, it did not whiten my teeth like it should have and burned my gums.  Would not recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> same as suggested by my dentist only less expensive</li>
    <li> Great product cheaper than the dentist</li>
    <li> A co-worker recommended these so I tried it out and I am glad I did.  It&#x27;s much better than going to the dentist and getting my teeth whiter through them.  Much less painful!</li>
    <li> I got this from my dentist and it was $30 for ONE tube! That&#x27;s just crazy, so I searched it and found this deal. It is EXACTLY the same. I like this bleach because it has the added &amp;#34;spout&amp;#34; to put on the end so its easier to put in trays...you don&#x27;t waste any.</li>
    <li> Great product. Have been using this for years. Can cause sensitivity, just easy off on the time exposure. Whittens fast.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, but strong.  This is the same product I received from my dentist.  Use with toothpaste for sensitive teeth.  Less than one hour application recommended</li>
    <li> I was pleased that the expiration date wasn&#x27;t until the end of 2014.  My teeth look great.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t help but get some on your gums and this stuff set my gums on fire to where I couldn&#x27;t even brush my teeth for about five days. The trick I learned for me is to use it about 2-3 days and then wait about 4-5 days before I use it again. This gives my gums time to heal. It is slower this way but it will whiten your teeth just the same. I just started my second three pak (for maintenance) and my teeth look much better.</li>
    <li> I contacted Phillips Zoom directly and they said they bought out the original NiteWhite.  Zoom said their product only has about a 12 month shelf life.  BEWARE buying expired products!  The expiration date is printed on a label on the plastic package.  I just ordered on 4/7/14 and the package I received was stamped \\&quot;EXP DATE: 2015-05\\&quot;.  They are the new white and black syringes labeled Phillips Zoom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you order from someone other than Express Health, check the expiration date and the new white and black packaging!  DO NOT be fooled into buying the older, expired products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Dentist wanted $85 for the $29 Phillips Zoom product I just purchased from Amazon.</li>
    <li> The best whitner I have found. A friend told me about this item and I just purchase my second order</li>
    <li> Best price and best used as maintenance following brite smile whitening</li>
    <li> I have purchased this in the past from my dentist.  I was very happy to find it available on Amazon and save some money while still getting what I needed. The product seem fresh.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 22% I love it find myself wanting to whitening my teeth every night but the only problem it irritates my gums but I still love it it works great. It&#x27;s a must have😍</li>
    <li> I had a teeth whitening procedure called Zoom and i was very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I was given 3 syringes with the procedure. To buy further syringes from my dentist was very expensive. The Phillips Zoom Whitening syringes were excellent and considerably cheeper than the dentist.</li>
    <li> I have been buying whitening gel for over 10 years and the packaging on this gel is absurdly complicated and wasteful of product.  The gel is OK but I have gotten better gels from other supplies at better pricing.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on my teeth now!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping.great product</li>
    <li> Arrived exactly as stated. Love that I can purchase this online (lasts for a LONG time) instead of forking out hundreds of dollars at the dental office! I use in conjunction with a little LED light. Works great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if Amazon will publish this but I hope it goes through. Just fyi, other products by SmileMedic have been reported to be tampered with; one apparently made some woman and her husband sick. It could just be coincidence but it might be best just to buy from someone else/get this from your dentist.</li>
    <li> Good price. Good product</li>
    <li> ive been a heavy smoker for the last 20 years, however ive always looked after my teeth, i use a sonicare electric toothbrush and the whitening gel pens which dont make my teeth any whiter but kept the stains away. i have been a non smoker for around 3 months now so as a reward i decided to go to my dentist and treat myself to teeth whitening, i paid in full which was £290, the trays were moulded exactly to match my teeth which took a few days to be returned to the dentist, ive had 2 treatments at the dentist and then told i take the trays home and do it myself until the required whiteness is achieved, when i was given the pack to take home i noticed it was philips zoom whitening so i thought i&#x27;d look on the net to see if it was a dental product or available for the general public to buy, HOW GUTTED AM I!!!!! I could of saved myself £250! I am pleased with this product, you do get results and mine is only 16%, so the moral of this review is, dont go to your dentist to have this teeth whitening done, just buy this for a alot less</li>
    <li> Was not the most effective. I have used others and got amazing results. This product left me questioning did I really use anything?</li>
    <li> Expensive, but awesome results. Use these for an hour once a week and have chicklets for teeth.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product, even for sensitive gums like mine. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> i love it! i will buy it from you guy from now on...</li>
    <li> I had the zoom done in my dental office. This did a good job at home. Will purchase again !</li>
    <li> I am a dental nurse and work at a dentist, this is the proper stuff and works amazingly with custom made whitening trays. Quick delivery, Very happy would order again.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this batch of nitewhite. I had the 22% concentration but I&#x27;m not sure there is much difference in the whitening of my teeth. My dentist told me to keep it on for a max of 1 hour...their instructions are for much longer but I would be reluctant to leave it on for longer than 1 hour. Do you know if this the authentic Philips brand or a copy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous treatments using the same treatment have been more successful (bought from your website).&lt;br /&gt;Hope this is of some interest to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosalind Blake</li>
    <li> This item is just as expected.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great. Awesome price also.</li>
    <li> This has done a GREAT job whitening my teeth. I am a smoker and tea drinker and thought it would take forever to see the results. I kept the solution on for 2 hours on 3 separate nights and the results are good enough that I still haven&#x27;t finished the whitening gel. I will probably do another treatment in a week. I found no tooth sensitivity from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because of the quantity. One thing it does fall short on is the number of whitening treatments it says you will get out of the package. It says it is good for 9 whitenings. I admit I used too much on my first try but afterwards used it sparingly. I will be very lucky if I get 5 sessions out of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this again? ABSOLUTELY!</li>
    <li> Has done great at keeping my teeth pearly white!!</li>
    <li> In spite of the pain which is caused by the nature of this whitening products, it worked brilliantly!</li>
    <li> Love this product for at home whitening</li>
    <li> Half the price and same product I buy from dentist. Awesome.</li>
    <li> It was not as good as the original one that I got from the dentist.</li>
    <li> I tried other brands but I did not like them. Zoom is the only brand for me.</li>
    <li> Worked well. Did not find uncomfortable to wear throughout the night. Good results for me and my wife.</li>
    <li> Not real stuff.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Great item&lt;br /&gt;Great seller&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Works great.  Keep it off the gums as it can irritate them.</li>
    <li> This is the same product in a higher percentage than my dentist was selling to me, and at a lower cost.  My dentist made plastic trays for me that fit my teeth.  I have had them for several years.  I simply squirt the gel into the trays and put them into my mouth at bedtime.  In the morning, I remove the trays from my mouth.  I rinse my mouth and the trays, and brush my teeth and the trays to eliminate any remaining gel.  Then, I let the trays dry and store them in the container my dentist provided.  I do this every one to two months, whenever I think my teeth need to be brightened.  My teeth aren&#x27;t porcelan white, but they aren&#x27;t yellow either.  They just look naturally bright and clean.</li>
    <li> Item arrived sooner than expected, which of course is a plus. Teeth were visibly whitened within 2-3 uses. I may have to purchase the one that you only have to wear for one hour as opposed to two hours because sometimes I&#x27;m short on time. But it definitely works and I will be ordering more. ❤️</li>
    <li> I had gotten two three-packs of this from my dentist after an exam and casting.  My expectations were greatly disappointed after the six syringes were gone.  That&#x27;s when I ordered one three-pack from Amazon.com.  Now that&#x27;s gone and I see no change.  It was all a waste of money, $300 to be exact considering everything.</li>
