<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a week, and I can already see improvement in my face. My skin is softer and feels much less dry. Even my stubborn wrinkles look better and my makeup stays fresh all day long. I&#x27;m making VC 20 a regular part of my beauty regimen. Thank goodness I found this - I was seriously thinking that a face lift was the only way to make my skin look younger. I&#x27;m sold on the benefits of vitamin C for the skin - and I&#x27;ve learned about how hyaluronic acid helps retain moisture in the skin.</li>
    <li> Very stiff which makes me feel tightened but then cannot put makeup over or it would break down effectiveness...  If you don&#x27;t wear face makeup it will be excellent..</li>
    <li> I love this product! VC20 has brought a newfound radiance to my face. I may be 41, but I was still getting pimples every now and then, until I started using this serum. They say that vitamin C is as good for your skin as it is for your body, and I can see why. They also say that 40 is the new 25, and that&#x27;s certainly been the case for me, thanks to VC20. If you want smoother, wrinkle free, healthier-looking skin, get this product now.</li>
    <li> Heard alot about VC20, can&#x27;t wait to try it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it, my eyes are smoother and the fine lines are actually disappearing! Try it today! You will love it!</li>
    <li> I have noticed the lines on my forehead have greatly diminished and have been asking what my secret was. I told them I started using this serum!  It isn&#x27;t irritating at all, does not feel drying, and I would feel a tightening of my skin within a few seconds after application. I use the product on my face and neck and even under my eyes. I let it dry which only take a few seconds then put my moisturizer on and sometimes makeup over it depending if I have things to do that day. The lines around my lips and the lines on my forehead have diminished greatly and my face looks brighter. My pores are even smaller which is great since my pores have been really big lately. I think I look a lot younger than I am because of this product!</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the majority of the reviews on here that this stuff is AMAZING. I am 35 years old with large pores and some blemishes. I have been using this for about 1 week and I can already see a vast improvement in pore size, plus my skin is very soft now. I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
    <li> I love this serum! I get a lot of dark spots on my face and have some sun damage, I&#x27;ve noticed that my face has gotten a lot brighter, more vibrant and looks much better after using this serum for a week. The serum goes on smooth, blends in well, it worked great even under my make up. Overall I will be using this again.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I&#x27;ll say it over and over again. I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about it and since I&#x27;ve started using it, I can see why people love it so much. I only use a couple of tiny drops, rub them in the palms of my hands and apply in circular motions, on my clean face. It is light on my skin and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation. This product works well. I like it. My skin is looking good and pretty youthful!</li>
    <li> I hate how much I LOVE this stuff because I cannot live without it now. I have only been using it for a few weeks and my skin looks smoother, softer and brighter. Also, my acne scars are slowly fading away, and this is only after a couple of weeks!</li>
    <li> Really enjoy the way it makes me feel. I would recommend to anyone my age group</li>
    <li> This is part of my nightly routine. When my daughter was visiting for a week I had her try it and she loved it also. It&#x27;s light and absorbs beautifully!</li>
    <li> this product is so light and creamy to apply, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot and it leaves your skin feeling so soft, my skin feels as soft at the end of the day as it did when i first applied it.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying this is a good product. It&#x27;s no miracle serum but it&#x27;s refreshig and it works. My concern is not in the product itself but in the marketing of this company NexGen Biolabs. I&#x27;d be willing to bet that 90% of the reviews on this product are fake. Read them they all read as if they were written by the same person using words like &amp;#34;luster&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;dull&amp;#34; over and over while telling a story of how they bought it for their mother. Also check the dates of the reviews no small niche product like this gets 3-5 reviews each day let alone 5 star reviews. I believe they bought their own product from several made up accounts and left reviews. Look at their other 50 or so products under their profile. They also all have perfect 5 star reviews. You can&#x27;t tell me a company in the supplement and beauty space Is making everyone happy that&#x27;s impossible. Any real reviews they get they quickly vote down but saying &amp;#34;not helpful&amp;#34; again the product is good they don&#x27;t need to fake it up the rankings.</li>
    <li> Of all the lotions, potions, and elixirs out there promising new skin and fewer wrinkles, the vitamin C and hyaluronic acid products have been the most effective thing I&#x27;ve tried.  This one made me a believer so I also purchased the Poppy Austin brand which is a little less expensive and I like even better.  Anyway, if you actually have any wrinkles (when I was younger and offered this type of product, I admit, I didn&#x27;t really get it, but now that I&#x27;m older...) or you just want that even-toned quality, then it&#x27;s probably worth trying.</li>
    <li> I an surprised at how well this serum worked. My skin looks and feels much softer and younger. My acne scars were healed, age spots reduced and fine lines and wrinkles minimized.</li>
    <li> When you order a product twice, that says something! I am quite pleased with this serum and until I find a better performing product I will keep using it. I use it daily and I like the way my skin feels. This has become part of my daily skin care regimen and I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum now for a few weeks and really love it. It is light weight and non-greasy, so my skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily after I apply it. It goes on easily and absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling smoother and looking brighter. Just a few drops go a long way. I like that it helps to repair and protect against sun damage, and fades sun spots too. Overall a great, high quality product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works very well.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have old acne scars from my teenage years and a scar on my forehead from stitches at the age of 3. My acne scars are barely noticeable and the scar on my forehead is dramatically reduced. I now feel confident in not wearing foundation because of what this has done for my skin. This is my new favorite serum!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best serum I have ever used. I could really start seeing a difference very quickly and I always feel like my face is protected when I put it on. Will never use any other product!</li>
    <li> This serum is very helpful for my sensitive skin. People can use it as a prevention for wrinkles if they start using it from the first signs of aging. Very light &amp; NOT GREASY</li>
    <li> Check all the reviewers comments. The only products reviewed are this and a diet product.SCAM SCAM</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT FOR WRINKLES I HAVE EVER USED I SAW RESULTS IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find something that works at a reasonable price. Delivered very quickly and I am happy.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. I have been using it 1 week and I have noticed an improvement where the wrinkles are least noticable. My skin is more moist too. Not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I got this product recently after learning about it from a friend and I have already noticed a marked difference in my skin texture and quality…it has also started to get smooth.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing is light and easy to apply. Perfect for any kind of skin , bought for my husband too .</li>
    <li> The moment I applied to my face I noticed the amazing results My skin glowed and tightening was very apparent. Great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month. I seem to see am improvement with fine lines and my skins texture overall. I like the consistency as well as I have used other Vit C that is rather runny and difficult to apply.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.</li>
    <li> Ya know, i was all set to buy this until i read these reviews. ..could they be any more obviously written by the seller themselves? ?? If its that good, the positive reviews will come...makes me think they must not be confident in the product to have to write those ridiculous reviews...count me out!</li>
    <li> Love it. Fast and great product. My skin looks great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an anti-aging serum that is also oil free because I have oily/combination skin. This serum is great because it goes on smooth and easy, and is very light weight. I do not have wrinkles yet, but I do have acne scars that I am hoping to get rid of.</li>
    <li> I was quite apprehensive about this VC20 anti aging serum at first but as I started to notice the difference I was totally convinced of its efficiency and credibility..</li>
    <li> When I first read about this particular product at a magazine, I decided to give it a try since I was so worried about my aging ski...this came as a saviour….</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this serum. I love the way it feels on my face and doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy.</li>
    <li> I say 3rd best purchase because this is my 3rd purchase of this product, It really works and i would not be without it.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different eye serums and honestly, I could never see a difference with any of them. I have just finished my first bottle of this product and ordered my second. I definitely have fewer lines under my eyes and I have noticed that my eyelids are much less crepy as well.</li>
    <li> Have not seen any special changes!</li>
    <li> It is ok, it stings my skin a bit when I put it on.  After it drys on you skin, that feeling goes away.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.  Other forms of vitamin C are better</li>
    <li> Im 54 years old and have notices skin getting looser. Tried it for 3 weeks and didn&#x27;t really notice any changes</li>
    <li> This is great I was recommended by a great friend to try this out and i really saw great results.!!!!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my mom as a present for Christmas, and she absolutely loves it. This is her review below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this serum for Christmas and absolutely love it. I ran across it while searching for skin oils and put it on my wish list. I am not disappointed! It goes on smooth &amp; silky, not greasy or drying - and you don&#x27;t need a moisterizer. Perfect as is! My skin looked great the next day and can&#x27;t wait for the long term results. An awesome find!</li>
    <li> The product itself seems good, but the dispenser is irratic..I have gotten &amp;#34;squirted&amp;#34; quite a few times when trying to dispense just a little...perhaps a little redesigning?</li>
    <li> This serum is one of the best ones I&#x27;ve tried. I like the consistency of the serum, not a thin liquid, has a thicker consistency.I use this at night after exfoliating. My skin seems to be a little firmer and the tone is improving. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have noticed an improvement in the fine lines around my eyes. Many people do not know that Vitamin C is very good for the skin and reveals a younger looking and blemish free hide. I love VC20</li>
    <li> From that very first day, when VC20 and my face were introduced, it was a love- hate relationship. The two were SO hopeful in the beginning But after two weeks of being together it seemed that VC20 was treating my face differently then the beginning and was becoming somewhat irritating. Hopeful to find that perfect match my face prevailed; though sadly after one month of trying to make it work, it proved to no avail. VC20 became much to irritating for my face to handle and in the end they had no choice but to part ways. Sad to let go I knew it was time to email customer service and inquire about the return process. It was During this time that all hope for my face finding love was restored!! The return was effortless and the company followed through with there guarantee within two days of submitting my email!!! I gave it 5 stars because this is a product that has an OUTSTANDING company to back it up. If your face is lucky enough to fall in love with VC20 ,or, if your face Decides it&#x27;s not the one, You have nothing to lose in trying this for yourself. It didn&#x27;t work for me but It may for you and I truly hope it does. Good luck and take that chance!!</li>
    <li> i have not seen as much change in my skin as I hoped, but it definitely makes it look much healthier. I&#x27;m still happy with this product and would buy it again and recommend it.</li>
    <li> All good especially delivery speed</li>
    <li> Great serum! I use this with my other skin products and have great results.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this serum from my mother and just loved how it made my skin feel so soft. I am a huge fan of Nexgen Biolabs products already and this makes my face feel like a baby&#x27;s. I don&#x27;t know what it does, but my blemishes have reduced and my skin is now more clear.</li>
    <li> This product is the best I have ever used! I recommend this product to any one and every one! My skin has never been this wrinkle free and soft! I just can&#x27;t believe it! WOW! Outstanding!</li>
    <li> Love the light/clean feel of this product</li>
    <li> Recently started using VC20 eye serum around my late 30s eyes and notice obvious results, less dark circles below my eyes, and it gives my eyes a daily boost that gets me through my day.</li>
    <li> THANK YOU SO MUCH! I used this product for a full month and amazing results!!! The wrinkles on my afce, the bags under my eyes, and stretch marks are all gone. Amazing products its magic in a bottle. Absolutely amazing product, amazed by the results, I look about 10 years younger absolutely amazing</li>
    <li> This serum definitely increases moisture to the skin and I can feel the product working on my skin. The only problem I have is that the pump seems to be defective. When I use the pump, product seeps out from between the pump and the lower piece. I think vitamin C products need to be sealed completely in order to keep their integrity, so will try to find another suitable bottle to transfer the product to. Not sure I would order from this co. again for this reason, as I just don&#x27;t have the time to hassle with returns.</li>
    <li> Great product delivered as promised. 5 star review.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C serum is just so amazing on your skin!!! I love this VC20!!!! It leaves my skin feeling refreshed, and oh so very soft. It reduces those pesky wrinkles while not costing you an arm and a leg. This is a must have product for any womens&#x27; beauty regime.</li>
    <li> used a lot of Vitamin C and this is nothing exceptional, if it even has Vitamin C in it. I really&lt;br /&gt;believe it is mind over matter on the great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;The advertisement makes you believe you are getting something wonderful when it is really just another false promise</li>
    <li> Love the texture and the fact that it absorbs quickly. Love the natural ingredients. Absolutely love this serum!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I am pretty picky about my beauty products, but I will forever use this one! I bought this for my Christmas Gift and it feels so amazing! I can totally feel my face more supple and less dry. I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, though I am 49, but the ones I have seem less visible since I have been using this product...yaay!!! It feels like a luxurious spa treatment product!</li>
    <li> Great product. It does do what i wanted it for – it &amp;#34;fades dark spots&amp;#34;. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I received this at Christmas but, only used it for the first time last week. WOW! Results the FIRST time. I&#x27;m a grandmother so to see a difference in those annoying, ugly lines by your mouth. It is amazing and I&#x27;m hooked. Thanks Nexgen!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day for almost a year now. I started using this after starting to notice my skin starting to loosen up with age (noticed some &amp;#34;pre-jowls&amp;#34;, wrinkles, dullness starting around age 30 - now I&#x27;m almost 32). Immediately I saw results in terms of skin smoothness and &amp;#34;just looking refreshed&amp;#34; (don&#x27;t know how to explain it!). I feel like I&#x27;m now beginning to see a tighter, brighter complexion after long term regular usage.</li>
    <li> I received this very quickly.  This goes on beautifully, doesn&#x27;t dry out, so you can actually spread it. I noticed a difference the FIRST time I used it!!! I can&#x27;t wait to see what my 40+ skin will look like after a month&#x27;s use. I hate my smoker wrinkles around my mouth &amp; lips - I noticed a huge difference after 1 use. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I was first told about this VC20 serum by a colleague but I did not pay much heed then…but as I started t read up the reviews I realised that it was indeed different.</li>
    <li> Last spring I  tried three different skin care lines and have not been impressed, until I tried this serum. I am completely amazed at the product. All of the reviews were right. Your skin feels brand new and you&#x27;re left with beautiful smooth skin for your foundation. I&#x27;ve already told my mom and several friends. Thank You Nexgen!</li>
    <li> I have used this product and love the smoothness of application and love the way my skin feels when I have it on. The fine lines seem to fade away. Great product that is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I think this is one of the best Nexgen&#x27;s products for minimizing fine lines and wrinkles. I use it every day and won&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
    <li> This product has done wonders for my skin tone and texture. My mother In law and I are firm believers of this and the perfectionist cream.</li>
    <li> All those people who give this rave reviews, I don&#x27;t understand:  It smells, it&#x27;s sticky, it made my face feel dry and just odd.  Additionally (and probably the worst aspect), it made my fingernails go orange and I looked like a smoker with nicotine stains. This serum went down the sink.</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to take. Quick results</li>
    <li> This product is the best I&#x27;ve used so far when it comes to reducing lines and tightening up the skin on the face and neck. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with skin irritation or break-outs using this, and my skin is relatively sensitive. I&#x27;ve used a lot of &amp;#34;age reducing&amp;#34; products for many years now in order to keep my skin looking youthful and this is one of the better products on the market.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s strange that nobody has mentioned the strong scent from this item.  It smells really really horrible.  I do notice that my skin seems to have a glow but it did make me break out a bit.  I stopped using it morning and night.  I only use it at night now and the break out seem to have subsided.  I will have to keep using it to decide if this product is worth a re-purchase.</li>
    <li> I really love this product!  I was very skeptical before trying this because I have tried so many products that make promises that never really work, but this one is amazing and truly everything it was advertised to be.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for great results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a while now and I am completely hooked. I am 33 and have skin that is dry but also prone to spots. I have tried just about every moisturiser there is on the market and this is by far the best.</li>
    <li> LOVE It, goes on smooth, absorbs evenly. I use it for under my eyes and they look great, the skin looks a lot younger than for my age. I use it every evening, feel lost without it.</li>
