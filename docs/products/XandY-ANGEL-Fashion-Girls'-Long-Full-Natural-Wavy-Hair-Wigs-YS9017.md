      <li>Such a great price.</li>
      <li>Love it, will use it only for special days, and wife thinks it&#x27;s adorable , but she said I better not&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does look a bit different color wise depending on the lighting you&#x27;re in</li>
      <li>The real hair looks more sandy than honey colored.</li>
      <li>I bought this wig because the seller seemed trustworthy, and their reviews were outstanding for this wig in particular.</li>
      <li>This is my first wig ever!</li>
      <li>I really like how it feels and how comfortable it is.</li>
      <li>then I thought it was going to be , but that makes it fun to wear.</li>
      <li>It is very comfortable and beautiful without any cutting or styling, ive had it for a day</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s super super soft.</li>
      <li>It looks and feels real!</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>First of all, it took forever to come here.</li>
      <li>It looks so so real!</li>
      <li>The wig looks exactly like the picture.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s my first wig</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait until they get a higher variety for me to choose from.</li>
      <li>This is the first wig I have ever bought</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much better compared to the wigs sold in Halloween stores, and a strawberry blonde color.</li>
      <li>Definitely planning to get more..</li>
      <li>Very realistic wig</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>I tried to curl an undone curl on a lower heat setting with a curling iron, but it didn&#x27;t do anything but make the hair very visibly course.</li>
      <li>Also, it isn&#x27;t very heat resistant.</li>
      <li>cute kinda fake looking cause its way bright but could be fixed with some washes.</li>
      <li>, I didn&#x27;t expect much from my wig.</li>
      <li>really well</li>
      <li>Some people though it was my real hair.  </li>
      <li>and it arrived very quickily.</li>
      <li>Everyone thought it was real hair.</li>
      <li>It shipped fast.</li>
      <li>There aren&#x27;t any bald spots or anything, and even the wig cap works better than the other wig caps I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
      <li>The package SAYS blonde, but it is most definitely red.</li>
      <li>and it feels somewhat realistic.</li>
      <li>I wanted a blonde wig, but instead I got a reddish light brown one, with the same style.</li>
      <li>Sadly, I do not think I would wear this wig in public.</li>
      <li>so I was really surprised when I received this one.</li>
      <li>I decided to try the blonde version and it doesn&#x27;t have much thickness to it whatsoever.</li>
      <li>so fast extra bonus!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s straight up yellow!  </li>
      <li>Which sucks because I bought a purple wig from the same company and it took way less time to get to my house and looked great.  </li>
      <li>I wanted a blonde wig I could wear for fun, or even in public if it looked natural enough.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve went to actual wig stores that are allegedly high end</li>
      <li>There wasn&#x27;t much tangling, and the color looks similar enough to the picture.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not due to the photo being lightened-</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had any major issues with tangling and</li>
      <li>It matches the image perfectly, it isn&#x27;t thin, and the cap is fits very comfortably so I can wear it for extended periods of time without worrying about headache&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>If you want to wear this for daily use, I wouldn&#x27;t say it looks all that natural, unless you&#x27;re in sunlight.</li>
      <li>The style of the wig is kind of weird too.</li>
      <li>(I thought the color difference was more dramatic until I moved into a well lit area) but the difference isn&#x27;t enough to completely swap the look around.</li>
      <li>It came earlier than expected, and looks really realistic!</li>
      <li>The Delivery:&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this wig off of Amazon because not only did it have just great reviews (at the time), but in part of the description it mentioned the wigs usually taking only 7-10 days to arrive (claiming the amazon delivery estimate was false), which was about the time I would need it for Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;Instead, the wig took 26 days to arrive, and finally came today.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like in the picture. The bangs are heavy and cut at an angle. It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> The hair is blonde and yellow... gross. It doesn&#x27;t at all look like the picture, I am very disappointed. Buy if you are looking for a tacky yellowish blond wig.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!  Very realistic wig, I received a lot of compliments when I wore it for Halloween.  Some people though it was my real hair.  Definitely recommend it and it arrived very quickily.</li>
    <li> This wig is perfect! It came really quick! I just received it today and it&#x27;s my first wig and it&#x27;s PERFECT. Its just like the picture! It looks and feels real! I love it!</li>
    <li> It shipped fast. Everyone thought it was real hair. Does not look like a wig. Such a great price. You can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> It looks so so real! haha i couldnt imagine myself &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; but this wig does a great job. I like the color, the length and it&#x27;s super super soft. i&#x27;m lovin&#x27; it.</li>
    <li> It came earlier than expected, and looks really realistic! There aren&#x27;t any bald spots or anything, and even the wig cap works better than the other wig caps I&#x27;ve used before. It&#x27;s comfortable too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve went to actual wig stores that are allegedly high end and they were terrible ugly outdated selection and were too huge worst experience ever the quality of these wigs however is amazing and you get more bang for your buck I&#x27;m in love with it! Also it was shipped here so fast extra bonus!</li>
    <li> The Delivery:&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this wig off of Amazon because not only did it have just great reviews (at the time), but in part of the description it mentioned the wigs usually taking only 7-10 days to arrive (claiming the amazon delivery estimate was false), which was about the time I would need it for Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;Instead, the wig took 26 days to arrive, and finally came today. I checked the tracking number every day, and when it finally showed where it was (at least eleven days after I ordered), it was still in China. And it stayed in China for a long while after. When it finally arrived in the United States, it arrived rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The Wig:&lt;br /&gt;After the sudden rise in negative reviews, I didn&#x27;t expect much from my wig. Surprisingly, it turned out fine. It&#x27;s much better compared to the wigs sold in Halloween stores, and a strawberry blonde color. There is a small patch on the wig where the bangs and the other hair don&#x27;t meet well, so it needs to be covered up. This wig does not look &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, but for a costume it it worth the money, at least in my case. It&#x27;s kinda thin, but for only $20 dollars it&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;d avoid having the wig under flash, since it looks awful. There wasn&#x27;t much tangling, and the color looks similar enough to the picture. I&#x27;ll post some pictures of myself wearing the wig under different lighting, since there don&#x27;t seem to be any pictures yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the wig would have been perfect for Halloween, if only it had arrived in time. It&#x27;s partially my fault for ordering a wig so late. If you want to wear this for daily use, I wouldn&#x27;t say it looks all that natural, unless you&#x27;re in sunlight.</li>
    <li> I decided to try the blonde version and it doesn&#x27;t have much thickness to it whatsoever. It is very thin and would only work well if you were to wear a hat or beanie over it sadly. There are a lot of holes and it doesn&#x27;t seem as long as in the picture either.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig because the seller seemed trustworthy, and their reviews were outstanding for this wig in particular. I wanted a blonde wig I could wear for fun, or even in public if it looked natural enough. Sadly, I do not think I would wear this wig in public. The wig also came in a completely different color than the one shown in the image. I wanted a blonde wig, but instead I got a reddish light brown one, with the same style. I put it on and was pleased, but not impressed. I don&#x27;t understand why the wig was auburn, when I bought the blonde one. If you want a BLONDE wig like I did, do not buy this. I may have gotten the wrong one on accident, but who knows. Other than that, it&#x27;s a little too shiny to wear in public alone, and too thin and long to look even somewhat natural. Also, it isn&#x27;t very heat resistant. I tried to curl an undone curl on a lower heat setting with a curling iron, but it didn&#x27;t do anything but make the hair very visibly course. It didn&#x27;t melt, but it changed in texture to an extent that I wouldn&#x27;t say is heat-resistant. I do not recommend buying this specific wig.</li>
    <li> This is the first wig I have ever bought and I am so happy with it. I wore it for Halloween and everyone thought I dyed my hair, its that amazing looking. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. If I am ever in need of another wig I will definitely choose X&amp;Y Angel.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know who they&#x27;re paying to write these reviews...but...uhhh this wig is horrible!!  Someone bought it for me off my wishlist, so if it doesn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m a verified buyer on here then that&#x27;s why.  It&#x27;s straight up yellow!  It fits alright but the color is just soooo bad and literally looks absolutely nothing like the picture.  I&#x27;m horribly dissatisfied! Which sucks because I bought a purple wig from the same company and it took way less time to get to my house and looked great.  This took forever in the mail, came in a bag in my mailbox and was just all around crappy.  BAD BAD BAD.  If you waste your money on this you&#x27;re crazy.</li>
    <li> The wig was great and arrived on time. My friends loved it. However the color felt a little off. The real hair looks more sandy than honey colored. There&#x27;s a great feel to it and it feels somewhat realistic. The length is great and you can either wear it right out of the package or style it yourself. I love the seller. This is my second time buying. I can&#x27;t wait until they get a higher variety for me to choose from.</li>
    <li> It is very comfortable and beautiful without any cutting or styling, ive had it for a day but I am already in love~~</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had iffy luck with buying wigs off of Amazon so I was really surprised when I received this one. It matches the image perfectly, it isn&#x27;t thin, and the cap is fits very comfortably so I can wear it for extended periods of time without worrying about headache&#x27;s. I haven&#x27;t had any major issues with tangling and it photograph&#x27;s really well if you&#x27;re buying it for that reason. It does look a bit different color wise depending on the lighting you&#x27;re in (I thought the color difference was more dramatic until I moved into a well lit area) but the difference isn&#x27;t enough to completely swap the look around. Again it was definitely a pleasant surprise so if you&#x27;re back and forth with it I&#x27;d say go for it.</li>
    <li> This wig needed some trimming; it isn&#x27;t perfect, but it is nice. I might wear it sometimes for a costume.</li>
    <li> This is my first wig ever! I am truly impressed because it is so realistic. I fell in love with it as soon as I saw it. The wig looks exactly like the picture. It untangles very easily as well! So so so beautiful. The shipping was also faster than expected. &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for your amazing product. :)</li>
    <li> The wig that was delivered to me was auburn, not blonde. Didn&#x27;t think it would happen to me after reading the other comments about a reddish brown wig being delivered, but it did. It&#x27;s not due to the photo being lightened- the DESCRIPTION of this product says BLONDE in the header and it&#x27;s NOT.</li>
    <li> My wig arrived today, the day before I need to wear it for a party. I&#x27;m going as Alice from Alice &amp; Wonderland, so I thought this would be a great blonde wig. The package SAYS blonde, but it is most definitely red. I will never buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I have bought over 10 X&amp;Y Angel wigs and this is the only one I have not liked. The color is nothing like the picture. It is a orange gold that looks like an unhealthy dark yellow. Very ugly for my light skin tone. They make the wigs in orders of 200 and sometimes a batch gets an off color. I got one from a bad batch. The style of the wig is kind of weird too. It would be good for pig tails and pony tails, or some kind of Loretta Lynn country music farmers daughter costume.</li>
    <li> Not like in the picture but cute kinda fake looking cause its way bright but could be fixed with some washes.</li>
    <li> just received it, took a little longer then I thought it would,&lt;br /&gt;But Love it, will use it only for special days, and wife thinks it&#x27;s adorable , but she said I better not&lt;br /&gt;wear it to bed ( that&#x27;s now I&#x27;m ruined other wigs)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a little longer then I thought it was going to be , but that makes it fun to wear.</li>
    <li> It was fuller and easy to use... I really like how it feels and how comfortable it is. Definitely planning to get more.. ;) thanks</li>
    <li> First of all, it took forever to come here. Second of all it&#x27;s YELLOW. I don&#x27;t know who pays these people to write these false reviews but this wig is YELLOW. I will post a pic to show it. Not at all like the pictures aside from the style. Bangs were long, so I had to trim them. It&#x27;s shiny and looks fake in certain lights. Would not wear outside.</li>
