      <li>an the zero gapped blades cut a lil better .</li>
      <li>Out of the box (without adjusting blade), the pro-mate blade cuts slightly better than the factory andis blade.</li>

      <li>Currently the best on the market.</li>
      <li>then I love getting stuff in the mailbox</li>
      <li>3 Years ago when I bought the T-ouliner, out of the box I enjoyed the performance.</li>

      <li>For awhile I was satisfied with the sharpness when giving haircuts</li>
      <li>and i find it works much better for me.</li>
      <li>I would say it&#x27;s better than the andis blade.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This blade is trash.... Dont buy</li>
    <li> Way better than original blade.</li>
    <li> Bought to replace my current T-blade Andis Cutters. Quality if very good. Worked right off the bat. Price was right. Planning on ordering again in the future.</li>
    <li> Wow all I can say is I love this blade. It cuts much better then the original on &amp; the price was awesome as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased them b/c I saw them being used by a barber from Atlanta on YouTube and he claimed they were the best ever.  Did a little research. Found the website, which I got them cheaper on here. At first I couldn&#x27;t see the difference until I adjusted them to my satifaction and they are superior.  I ordered the square ones also.</li>
    <li> Great it was right on time</li>
    <li> Bought this in Sept, and haven&#x27;t been able to use... tried to find the receipt  to return it and couldn&#x27;t so now I&#x27;m stuck with this sorry blade... won&#x27;t even cut arm arm just pulls the hair.... it&#x27;s dull and not gold like the others, it&#x27;s black? Haven&#x27;t been able to get ahold of the seller after multiple attempts and emails...</li>
    <li> i was torn not sure if i should buy this blade or not because of some of the bad reviews it got but I&#x27;m glad i decided to . This blade is amazing makes a beautiful sharp line weather it&#x27;s your neckline or forehead line without much pressure at all.. these are one touch cut blade i bought the Anivo Blade Adjuster which u can get right here ----&gt; [...]  and u are good to go. Those who gave a bad review on this blade do not know what they are talking about trust me!!!!!</li>
    <li> I guess Amazon requires you to give 1 star; but I&#x27;ll tell you this product did not warrent that. With all the blades I&#x27;ve brought so far all had to be adjusted. After the adjustments were made they worked like a charm. I can not say that for this  Pro-Mate product. Out of the box they baerly cut; after the being oiled and sprayed not much better; after adjusting them I still wasn&#x27;t pleased. These blased are all hype and I will never buy they again</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed that my package states NEW but the package was open when I received it</li>
    <li> The blade came in carbon black not gold &amp; it was very dull I have to go get it sharpened.</li>
    <li> WELL I BEEN CUTTIN HAIR FOR YEARS IN TAMPA FLORIDA I BEEN DOING THIS THING FOR A MINUTE I ONLY HAVE THE BEST BRANDS IN CLIPPERS MASTERS T OUTLINER WAHL ETC. WELL ITS SHARP YOU ADJUST IT AND IT SKINS IT GOOD WORKS FOR REAL. KUTS 813</li>
    <li> This blade run circles around it&#x27;s competition. Blade cuts are very clean and smooth. My shaved head always look like Mr. Clean. Currently the best on the market. You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Best blade for ethnic hair period.  You don&#x27;t even have to apply much pressure at all to get a MUCH better line than the stock Andis blade.  I used to find myself going over a line 5-10 times with the stock blade while having to apply quiet a bit of pressure, but these babys, twice at the most with little pressure and the line is fabulous!!!</li>
    <li> they were sharp. no complains..better than the store blades. I will recommended. to any one who need them. be safe</li>
    <li> At first I was wary of this blade because of the hype surrounding it and the mixed reviews. I decided to take the chance but only after trying everything with my stock andis blade. I zero-gapped the blade dozens of times and even stone-sharpened it. For awhile I was satisfied with the sharpness when giving haircuts but I always had a feeling that it should be cutting closer. So I decided to buy the promate and see for myself. Other reviewers are right, right out of the box this blade was cutting closer than my andis blade. This blade cuts closer and takes less passes to cut all the hair off, I recommend it if you&#x27;ve adjusted your stock blade and still aren&#x27;t satisfied.</li>
    <li> I use the t-blade to trim my facial hair and this blade is infinitely smoother and more comfortable than the stock blades.  Just ensure you set the blade cut at the right height for your application.</li>
    <li> Now having tried both this and the Andis OEM replacements, I&#x27;ll use exclusively Pro-Mate blade replacements in the future. Great product and value.</li>
    <li> A subpar knock-off that&#x27;s more expensive than the manufacturer&#x27;s offering? Really? Unfortunately, it&#x27;s true. Highly displeased with these Pro-Mate blades as I utilize my clippers as a substitute for a razor to shave my lower jaw/neck area due to sensitive skin and bad razor burn. My objective is to get as close a shave as possible. I was sold by the claims that they achieved a very close shave in the reviews of this product and gave them a shot. Upon installing them on my clippers, the first thing I noticed were the large, bold teeth on these blades in comparison to the much finer teeth on the Andis blades. I lubricated them and turned on the clippers for a test run, not having shaved in about 28 hours. These blades did not reach a single hair of stubble on my face. Absolutely nothing, rendering them completely useless to me at that point. I immediately took them back off and repackaged them for a return/refund, I re-installed the stock Andis blades and had a regular shave. Hands down the closest shave you&#x27;ll achieve with an Andis T-Outliner sans a razor. I would conclude that depending on how you intend to use and what result you seek in using your Andis clippers, these blades may just suffice for your purposes. If you want the closest shave you can get out of them, then stick with the stock Andis blades, maintain them, and buy Andis replacements, not to mention they&#x27;re actually cheaper than these.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I sure wish Andis could come out with something like this. No need to adjust the blades. It&#x27;s preset to the closest so the hairs will be cut off easily. Great for lineups and edging. It&#x27;s a barber must have tool.</li>
    <li> I bought this blade after seeing various videos on youtube about it and seeing the crispness of the shape-up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people at Pro-mate seem like they just looked at the main complaints with the stock T-outliner blade and then designed this blade for the consumer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two things i appreciate the most about this blade are, One, they come PRE ADJUSTED!!! This is not too big of a deal for me because I am use to adjusting blades, but for other people who aren&#x27;t comfortable with it, or people who don&#x27;t know how to properly adjust a blade it is a blessing.  And two, this blade doesn&#x27;t get hot as fast as the stock blade.  LIke anything with friction, it will eventually get hot, but whatever the people at Promate did, they did a good job because this stays cool a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all of your clipping products, you must keep it cleaned because hair inside the blades will dull them and you wont get that crisp line up, and also you must keep oiled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this blade and will never buy another stock t-outliner blade again!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3107ZGY2T4EJG]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the styliner 2 for over ten years,(only 2 different sets), and I&#x27;ve always loved them because they cut close and they stay cooler than the t-outliner. But when I ordered the promate blade, it took them to a whole other level. I am about to order the M3&#x27;s and can&#x27;t wait to get the Pro Mate bades on those because they are supposed to be \\&quot;2011\\&quot; versions of trimmers. And with that blade on them they should be truly the bomb!!!</li>
    <li> overall the blade performs well, it gives a smooth shave with no after burn, thought both blades were be made out of the same material but so far then look sturdy enough to cut through all the dirt and grease I have to deal with. I would recommend them on a trial basis depending on how much they will be used and if they will be set differently or modified.</li>
    <li> I have read all the hype about the Pro-mate trimmer blades, and also about the Andis Outliner II. Well I&#x27;m testing both and let me say.\\&quot;Don&#x27;t waste your money.\\&quot; I have a cheap Andis rotary trimmer that cuts circles around both products. As for the Pro-mate, that&#x27;s nothing but stained hype. I believe the original Andis blade cuts better by far. Neither though cut like any rotary Andis makes.</li>
    <li> NO COMPLAINTS!!! I used this blade on my Andis T-outliner several times now and my front is still coming out sharp. In fact, I&#x27;m giving myself a sharper front than what my barber use to do.</li>
    <li> Ordered this because my barber used the copper colored blade and it was real nice... But I ordered one and recieved a black blade....the blade is no good at all! It does not cut good and pulls the hair...</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to replace my T-Outliner Blade and thought this would be the product. In my case I was wrong. This is strictly a lining blade. I use my T-Outliners for dry shaving my head and face. If you have a sensitive face becareful. When I used these blades for complete shave and lining I was whelped up and cut. I didn&#x27;t apply pressure to my face as I use them. They are just generally sharp. Great for lining but in my case my face is to sensitive to use them. Dont get me wrong I&#x27;m not knocking the product they just dont work in my favor.</li>
    <li> These blades are okay but I don&#x27;t think they live up to the hype that&#x27;s surrounded them. I was expecting more and don&#x27;t get me wrong, they do what the are supposed to do but they are not what I expected and I think the blades on the Andis GTX Experiences are a lot better than these</li>
    <li> Great blade for the andis t- liner. Cuts clean crisp line straight out of the package. I did not need \\&quot;sharpen\\&quot; the blade at all and do not recommend to as the blades are sharp from the factory. Great compliment for the andis t- liner.</li>
    <li> I bought these blades because the blades that come on the outliner II are just horrible, the teeth on them are so small that its very hard to get the curly hairs on the back of the neck or any hair for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; These blades are far superior to the stock blades because they come with deeper teeth and cut extremely close out of the package. I didnt really see that much of a difference as far as how fast the blades get hot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades are a must have for any barber that likes getting that clean edge up and clean lines&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 STARS</li>
    <li> Just got it today in the mail and was excited. I put it on and tried it and wow.....what a huge disappointment. It was not doing anything. Not lining up as they described it would do, not even trimming hair at all. Why on earth would they sell this when it doesn&#x27;t even work at all. Amazon users that are giving this 5 stars gotta be living on a different planet. I returned it and will be buying Andis Deep Tooth Blade and see how that goes. What a joke this product is!!!</li>
    <li> This blade gets much closer than the one that originally came w/ my Andis T Outliner.  I don&#x27;t understand why this style of blade isn&#x27;t being made or shipped with the device from the factory.  It&#x27;s that much better.  If you have a T-Outliner, you already should know how simple installation is.  This is just a much higher quality blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you think your current blade is fine - you should purchase this blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;This review was originally done 12/25/2009.  Today is 1/31/2013 and I&#x27;m just now replacing the blade (though I probably should have a year ago).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take a 5 star rating very seriously (go ahead - look through my reviews).  You have to \\&quot;knock my socks off\\&quot; in terms of performance/features AND price to get 5 stars.  This blade deserves it.</li>
    <li> If you like giving your customers a nice, sharp line, you must buy theses blades. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes when I first gave someone a line with these blades. They are extremely sharp. The client doesn&#x27;t even feel them. I use them with my black andis GTX trimmers (the more powerful version of the andis outliners) and they work extremly well. I went on YouTube and saw that the andis clipper guy was trying to misguide people about how well they work and I kind of got discouraged, but that dude was lying about that. Andis should make these blades stock on they&#x27;re trimmers. Order them now on amazon.com because they sell them the cheapest.</li>
    <li> what i did notice about these blades was the long cool time. other than that i had to sharpen them straight out the pack to make them work. my old blades worked better than these did at first. but for me it was a matter of breaking them in. once i did that they worked just fine.</li>
    <li> at first i didnt buy the grade cuz my stock one sucked or anything. i just bought it cuz my other one got a drop of water on it and rusted, so i figured id replace it. so i bought this and ended up being a pretty good upgrade. this blade is a whole lot better than the stock blade. Initially, dont use it how it&#x27;s adjusted out of the packaging. It was TOO close of a shave (learned that the hard way). then i adjusted it to my liking and the comfort level was great. and the lines came out sharp. i recommend it.</li>
    <li> i have not received my item . i try multiple times to contact the seller of barber tools i got no feedback. do not do business with them.</li>
    <li> I purchased these elsewhere about 4 weeks ago.  Oiled them up, cleaned hair, before and after using and cut fine until the fourth time I used them. They were dull and started pulling my hair.  I thought maybe adjusting them would fix the issue but boy was I wrong, it still was duller than snot. The original Andis blades lasted longer.  I am told I do not have thick hair and total time of use was about 40 mins.  Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I been using my T Ouliner for about 7 months and I been seeing reviews on this blade that it&#x27;s not what it seems and it&#x27;s all hype. I&#x27;m telling you as a consumer, upcoming barber, and as a human being, THESE BLADES ARE WHAT THEY SAY THEY ARE. I used to keep going over my hairline like 5-7 times just to make sure the line was crisp. I installed these blades, turned them on and it cut like a knife on butter. Smooth and sharp. Don&#x27;t use too much pressure because you will cut yourself (I did a little bit on my forearm just to test it according to the instructions). I even did my goatee and it cut like I shaved it. Sharp and precise. I recommend these blades to anyone who wants a sharper finish. Don&#x27;t let the bad reviews fool you. You will feel the difference immediately!</li>
    <li> I was really excited about using this blade, but once it got here and I started using it, I was a bit disappointed. I love how it came preset and it works great for edge ups and outlining, but not really good for balding. The good thing is, it doesn&#x27;t bite so it would be good to use on kids.</li>
    <li> Cuts much better than the stock blade.</li>
    <li> When I watched people using the pro mate blades I thought they were great so I looked them up on amazon and I decided to buy some and I was excited I always saw good reviews about them but when I got them I was really disappointed they weren&#x27;t  as sharp as everyone said I had bought some andis blades and they seem way much better than the promates so anyone ready this i suggest you get some andis blades because if u buy some of these pro mate blades be prepared to be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Like I said, top of the line right here!! Cant and you wont find better then some pro mates!! They seem to cut way closer then the regualr blades most clippers have on them. PRO-MATE</li>
    <li> idk if this seller sent me a used product when i was supposed to be buying a new one or just a defected one or what...but i purchased these promate blades because i got them off another site before and they worked amazing!! they cut like no other.. unfortunately i dropped my trimmers and they broke so i ordered some from this seller and have had them over a week but tried them for the first time today and idk if they sold me some used ones or what but these blades cut nothing like the promate blades i purchased before.. actually these blades hardly cut anything at all. there was so much drag it felt like these blades were pulling my hair instead of cutting. dont get me wrong i love the promate product i had in this past i just have no clue what is wrong with this one :(</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the seller, great communication, item was received in a reasonable time. I will purchase from them again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting and edging my own hair since 15 years old. I&#x27;m 36 now. I cut my kids hair as well. These blades just didn&#x27;t do a good job. Horrible actually. No where close to the stock blades. Returning and going with the Andis blades like I should have in the first place.</li>
    <li> i was expecting this pair of blades to be very sharp and cut hair very percise and it did not do so. they work as good or worse than the original andis toutliner blades. the only thing better is that they do not hurt as much as the original blades when they are placed on zero gap.</li>
    <li> I had to adjust the blade, because it felt blunt @ first, but it works ok now,so keep a screw driver nearby when u get it</li>
    <li> I have used Andis T-outliners for a few years now.  The only complaint that I ever had was that the blades would get hot.  Keeping in mind that I have very coarse and thick hair that is a pain to shave all the time and also, I keep a goatee that is hard to maintain due to different hair growth pattern of my face.  That being said, I was going to change out my blade on the Andis and looked around for something that I thought would work better.  I use the trimmer for my face mostly and once in a while for around the ears and neckline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So does this product do what it claims... yes and no.  In regards to keeping cool, then yes.  It does absolutely stay cooler than the original blades on the T outliner.  So it did solve the original problem I had.  Even when used it to the point that the plastic where you hold it was hot, the blades were still cool.  That is where the \\&quot;coolness\\&quot; ends.  I have adjusted it several times and I have found that it just does not cut as close as the original trimmer head.  I also have to make several passes across the same section to get it to cut well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that someone is going to mention this, so I will just bring it up in advance.  I have checked a lot of videos and looked at the instructions.  I have adjusted the blades and trimmed at different angles and going up with the trimmer and back down.  In my opinion, it is not a better trimmer head than the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually decided after trying it for a few months to go ahead and order the newer upgraded T- outliner that has a better cord and supposedly more power.  I will review that one after I have used it for a few months.  Hopefully my review is helpful to others of you that are on the fence.  I am not saying that you shouldn&#x27;t buy this product, but you should be aware of what its limitations.  It will work fine if you don&#x27;t have the kind of facial hair that I have, but if you are reading this review then it is likely that your hair is as hard to shaveas mine is and you also suffer from skin irritation and bumps when you shave.  I found that the original Andis would let me keep and almost shaved look and hopefully the new one I ordered will do the same.  But in the end, I don&#x27;t think this product is worth it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand some of the negative reviews here, but I can give you my honest opinion of these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut for about 6 months with the original Andis blades, and they were a bit dull to be honest.  I had to constantly go over lines 3-4 times before it cut cleanly.  Now, I never adjusted them any closer than factory setting.  I am sure that if you adjust them close to zero gap, they will cut a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I decided to go with the Pro-mate blades is that I left my T-Outliners in the bathroom for a week, and the Andis blades rusted.  I needed to replace them, and figured it was a perfect opportunity to try a new blade.  When I got the Pro-mates, they cut much more precisely with the first stroke.  I no longer had to go over lines again and again.  I think the reason is that the blades are adjusted closer in factory setting AND the stationary blade teeth are much deeper.  The deeper teeth work wonders for cutting with the corner of the T-blade and cutting the longer hair in edging and line-ups.  Also, the blade is rust free!  The diamond carbon coating really makes it easier to clean and maintain. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just got your T-outliners, I recommend that you adjust the Andis blade and try them out for awhile.  When they need replacement or if you are just fed up with them, I recommend that you go with the Pro-mates.  They are truly wonderful and make edgework much easier.  They are well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I almost returned my Andis T-Outliner back before I heard about Pro-mate. I cut my forehead hair, neck and mustache\beard and wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the performance the stock blade the clipper came with. I heard that barbers used Pro-mate so i gave it a try. Man, I&#x27;m happy I did. The clipper cuts closer than I expected, razor close. My edge ups are tighter and crisp. I couldnt be happier with this addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who owns an Andis T-Outliner MUST buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the package arrived fast.</li>
    <li> I read so much about these blades. I also youtubed them and I was very excited to finally get them. Long story short I gave them away.</li>
    <li> This aftermarker blades cut waaay sharper the original ones....Definately a best buy, would suggest these to anyone looking for a sharper cut.</li>
    <li> This is the worst thing I have ever purchased.  The blade doesn&#x27;t work.  It doesn&#x27;t cut hair.  Stick to the OEM #04521.</li>
    <li> This product was new and very clean. I will buy more stuff from this person. I havent had any problems with the blade its LEGIT.</li>
    <li> GREATEST blades you can find, i had bought these because the stock blades that came with my t-linder were okay and good, but they never cut super precise evne after multiple times and trials of attempting to adjust them. BUT these right out of the pack when i installed them within 5 minutes, they were loud and weren&#x27;t cutting properly, then i found out that i had installed them improperly...once i fixed my problem, tightened all bolts...these cut way close and i love them. Just gotta know what your doing before you make a review, especially if you are new to barbering, and as for me ive only been barbering for a year, but these hands down best, if after year or so if these show high signs of wear and tear im definately buying another pro-mate blade again. AND that gold, bronze look just tops this blade off with swag as well as thee best.</li>
    <li> Very sharp liners specifically used for detailing hair lines or shaping your facial hair giving you a clean cut all around!</li>
    <li> love this blade !! Hands down best outliner on the market. My friend is a barber and she says nothing compares to this blade, does over 1500 haircuts a month. She says it&#x27;ll last her about 4 months !! 5 STARS !!!!!</li>
    <li> I prefer the andis brand blades. Could be human error but they were noticably louder than the Andis brand blades I&#x27;ve installed.</li>
    <li> Great product. I hooked the blade up to the clippers and they didva great job cutting my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> The product works as good as it looks. I have sensitive dry skin so much so that if beard gets a  little long my Norelco will irritate skin after shave. I first use my Andis then the Norelco. Shave is almost none irritating and leaves face almost as smooth as a blade. One word to the wise, hand position very important so as to get a good angle, when you do you&#x27;ll find the blade to be very smooth on skin. I&#x27;m glad I bought this and recommend it to all users of trimmer.</li>
    <li> Let me take this time to say that the andis promate is as described..&lt;br /&gt;Works well on my face, and does not irritate the skin as other  blades did ...congrats to andis for providing another quality product to choose from.</li>
    <li> Simply put, these blades are superior to the stock blades.  They take everything that Andis stock blades provide and improve them.  The lines and points come out sharper, and you don&#x27;t have to go over it as many times.  Also they are easier on the skin, providing a smoother cut. This is my second time buying these blades, and I will continue to purchase them going forward.</li>
    <li> This is my second set of Pro-Mates; the first set broke when my trimmers were dropped.  Once properly aligned, these will be precise and keep cool during cutting.</li>
    <li> I was not Not satisfied. Doesnt give a close crisp edge. At least not for me. And they&#x27;re zero gapped.</li>
    <li> Easy adjustment, cuts very sharp and blade doesn&#x27;t get too hot. I would say it&#x27;s better than the andis blade.</li>
    <li> Heard/read a lot of hype about this blade, but I&#x27;m not blown away by it. I used an adjuster made specifically for the Andis T-outliner, even with that my lines are not as crispy as the original blade on my edgers. It cuts well, I only use it now to bald instead of edging.</li>
    <li> Its really not much to say. if you need replacement blades you found some pretty good ones. not a bad buy at all</li>
    <li> Not sharp at all. I feel like I wasted my money. How can I get it sharper. Cannot use it.</li>
    <li> To be honest I didn&#x27;t get a better cut than the T-Blade that came with the cutters. But this is the best replacement blade I guess. My other blades broke when I dropped my clippers so I replaced th em with these. Thanks it works perfect! Different Color, Same great cutting</li>
    <li> I ordered the &amp;#34;T-outliner head&amp;#34; (exactly what is shown in the product picture) but received the square head blade. I called to inform about the mistake and was told that I would need to ship the wrong blade back and then wait to be sent the correct blade. I was annoyed by this and needed a blade asap so I just kept the square head blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the square head blade, its not all that great. Out of the box (without adjusting blade), the pro-mate blade cuts slightly better than the factory andis blade. BUT, if you adjust and zero the andis blade, it is MUCH better. I used the promate blade for about 6 months, didnt like it too much, switched back to the andis blade and am very impressed.</li>
    <li> This product was not worth the price. Its performance was not effective, and did not give a close shave. Its installation makes for a fairly loud electric clippers. The golden image simply attracts the eye. I would reconsider if you&#x27;re interested in this product. The fact that one blade cost more than the actual andi&#x27;s clippers is ridiculous. It was my belief I was getting a set of blades, not a foolish \\&quot;gilded\\&quot; blade! The blade also does not fit the Andis T-Outlner smoothly, the grooves are questionable.</li>
    <li> just what i was looking for something sharper and stays cool, i love this blade</li>
    <li> pretty good.. good buy not to sharp but it does the job so it&#x27;s better on kids . .. .</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product it  is well made high quality blades cut with precision</li>
    <li> This blade didn&#x27;t cut well at all. It left hair behind and did not give a crisp edje up. And I also adjusted the blade for the closest cut possipble.  The standard blade did much better. I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective blade or what. I think that&#x27;s probably the case. So I&#x27;m going to try a blade from another seller because I reallywant to like these blades. The color looks real cool on my clippers.</li>
    <li> This is the best blade I seen so far. Have not had for very long, but if it last the way all the reviews insist, then its well worth its price.</li>
    <li> The blades look OK, but the stock Andis blade will give you a much closer cut.  Comparing to the Andis blade, the thickness of the bottom blade on the Pro-Mate is almost double than the Andis.  I was not able to get crisp lines with this blade, despite the other reviews.  Had high hopes for this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m with the other folks who say this blade seems dull. After re-seating the blade on the trimmer I tried it out and it didn&#x27;t line up my hair good at all. It pulled my hair and did not leave a nice crispy line (as other say it does). I don&#x27;t see what all the hype is about. I&#x27;ve done a lot of researching on this blade and I&#x27;m starting to believe that not everyone explains how they have these blades set. A lot of folks are zero gapping the blade, which is fine, but for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to mess with the OEM setting, these don&#x27;t cut good at all. I think any blade at zero gap will leave a nice crispy line...but these Pro-mate blades are no better than the regular T-Wide blade.</li>
    <li> these can even be zero gapped now in an andis zero gapper and they just do not cut as close as an andis blade.</li>
    <li> I bought this promote blade to replace the GTX blade i had broken. I have never used a primate blade before. Honestly this blade let me down. Compared to the GTX replacement blade for the Andis T-Outliner , This blade is not crisp cutting at all. The only reason why  I bought this promote was because it was on sale for a good price and I thought to give it a try. I have to double tap and go over the same spots just to get a decent edge up. Not how i thought it would perform.</li>
    <li> I could never get the blade to stay still, No matter how many times I tightened the screws. I even tried it on a different machine and had the same problem. Eventually I gave up on them and switched back to the regular Andis T-blade.</li>
    <li> This item sucks epecially because of the deeper Teeth . I wouldnt buy this product again. Now i have to buy new ones.</li>
    <li> They must have sent me an old dull blade! This is by far the worst blade I&#x27;ve ever used! It doesn&#x27;t cut any hair it just pulls the skin. I can not recommend this catastrophe to anyone. I zero gapped it, switch trimmers, adjusted tension and it&#x27;s still horrible! I&#x27;ll stick with the Andis blade!</li>
    <li> Good fit. Direct replacement.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me at all. Really disappointing. Couldn&#x27;t really get it to cut unless i went against the grain of my beard. Other reviews said this is a great blade for \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; folks. I&#x27;m not ethnic. Take that for what you will. I ordered the original andis blade and i find it works much better for me.</li>
    <li> First I am not a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; barber...However I have been cutting hair for over 25 years. I cut my two boys hair twice per week as well as my nephews. I normally purchase Andis Blades but decided to try out MD T-1 as well as the Pro-mate blades. I used the Anivo Blade setter [http://amzn.to/1bUvsVk] to adjust all three blades for sharpness and to provide an even comparison. My ranking of all three blades:&lt;br /&gt;1.Andis&lt;br /&gt;2.Pro-mate&lt;br /&gt;3.MD T-1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The OEM Andis blade was by far the sharpest of the three blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pro-mate was not as sharp but does provide a nice line just but not as crisp as the Andis. I do prefer using this blade for my 5 year old because the Andis blades tend to nick him a bit where as the Pro-mate did not. The Pro-mate installed perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MD T-1 for me is not useable. Does not fit well on my trimmers. I wish Andis and Pro-mate provided extra screws as did the MD- T-1 but I will be returning this blade.</li>
    <li> Way better than the regular t blade my old one would cut my skin so easily but i cant even feel the promate blade ahaha</li>
    <li> 1st one never recieved when the company was informed they immediately sent item too me. excellent customer service!&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: Beauty 4 You</li>
    <li> 1st off I love amazon, let me tell you why you don&#x27;t have to leave the house which is good for me then I love getting stuff in the mailbox then online shoppin give you the best deal which is even better for me hahaha I don&#x27;t even buy nothing from the mall no more im saveing tons of money,,,, now here is the review......these pro-mate t blades is the best out here will last you a lifetime enough said im bout to go line my hair up hahahahaha</li>
    <li> Delivery date was set for 9.15 and the product came today, one day early... Awesome. I&#x27;ve used the blade already and my face thanks you. I will definitely order from this company again.</li>
    <li> Eh.. Everyone claims it cuts closer (it doesn&#x27;t) it&#x27;s the same blade as the stock blade but gold.. &amp;#34;DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> SUPER SHARP DONT ZERO ANY FURTHER WILL CUT CUSTOMER. LOVE THEM GREAT BLADES, I HAVE ABACK UP OF THESE. THATS HOW MUCH I LIKE THEM</li>
    <li> I like this blade...when its sharp. However, when it gets dull, it bites. I&#x27;ve used Andis blades forever and have been looking for an alternative, as they get dull or don&#x27;t cut as sharp as I like -Albeit, they do not bite when dull. I tried this blade and it was very nice for a while. Once it got dull, I had to let it go.</li>
    <li> Tried them in 2009 and the were so so.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try the new improved version and they worked great. I work on Camp Pendelton military base and I have clients that like it very close. It passed my clients test.</li>
    <li> Thank you pro mate! I&#x27;ve been barbering for 11 years in this blade is one of the best blades you can buy right now. You need a straight edge razor to get any closer. Its save save lots of timeand time is money when you have other clients waiting for haircut or beard shape up</li>
    <li> great and on time. There were no issues and it worked out well. thank you again for this item. :-)</li>
    <li> It came earlier than expected, it&#x27;s cuts well and and looks nice. My replacement stock Andis blade felt like it did not cut well right out of the package so I tried to zero gap it myself which led to a trial and error phase of sharpening gapping trimming etc. So I bought a Andis zero gapped first and then out of curiosity(and research consisting of Amazon reviews and YouTube reviews) bought these, these cut like Andis blades zero gapped if not a tad bit better however a week later I bought the Whal Detailers which closer than both.&lt;br /&gt;If you have the money try them, now I have two trimmers with extra blades for one, nothing wrong with that. Not a barber just a hobby.</li>
    <li> the clipper is not good at all not worth the money I DO NOT RECOMMEND this trimmer blade at all</li>
    <li> This has lasted many years.  I recommend it in case your original blade gets damaged like mine did.</li>
    <li> The blades are good , I wish they could have been sharper but it keeps my edge up crispy! If you need new hair cut tools get these</li>
    <li> buying this item for my boyfriend was a great turn out, more customers &amp; cuts so good! its perfect if you do a lot of tapering</li>
    <li> The Pro-mate blade isn&#x27;t as sharp compared to the original t-outliner blade and doesn&#x27;t cut as close. I tried adjusting the blades but couldn&#x27;t get a close and sharp cut.</li>
    <li> My husband loved this</li>
    <li> the only benefit this blade has over the stock blade is that it runs cooler. Other than that it sucks. Stock blade on my andis gtx cuts  sharper lines.</li>
    <li> Dull dull dull! Terrible blade that is supposed to be set already. Was not and I cant use it.</li>
    <li> The problem with most reviewers of T-outliners and other trimmers is that they do not know how to use them. 3 Years ago when I bought the T-ouliner, out of the box I enjoyed the performance. Then a few days later I noticed the blade was not cutting as well. I looked at the blade ,and i noticed that the blade had dirt in it. Use a hairbrush or a designated toothbrush to brush out the dirt...never use water. Also I used to use hairspary to lubricate the blades. It works at first,but eventually the hairspray will coagulate and get sticky. And finally I always found it a challenge to adjust the blades. I followed several tutorials and youtube and now I finally got it right. These are the three main factors why people would give products relating to trimmers bad reviews.     Now lets talk about the Promate. I had to make sure that the moving ball was in the blade hole, and then I pressed the blade down. I aligned the screw holes and tightened them. It cuts like a dream. These will cut your hair to the point where there is little stubble. When I touch my face with the grain I fell nothing, but if I move my hand against the grain I feel some stubble. This is good enough for most African Americans because of our dark skin complexion. The stubble tends to blend in with our complexion. Also since it does not cut the hair all the way, you do not have to worry about razor bumps if you let you hair grow back. Another benefit is that the blade is noticeable cooler as well.     Pros   This is cost effective. I use this every 3 days with my brother and it could last me 1 year or 8 months before I notice a serious degrade it cutting quality.    Maintenance of the blade is important. Any brand of Clipper oil will serve you well. [[ASIN:B001BOISNU Andis 12108-W Clipper Oil]] Before every cut use it, and then wipe it off the blade. You want to make sure that the oil goes into the blade, and you do not want the outside of the blade to be oily.    Use a brush to clean the blade during use, especially if you have a dirty face. The blades will clog and performance will decrease.    Once a month&#x27; open the body of the trimmer and use an airblower,or toothbrush to remove hair. Be careful with vaccums because they can potentially give a static shock.    You can use a [[ASIN:B00009YV6G Smith Abrasives DBSF 6-Inch Diamond Sharpening Stone - Fine]] to lengthen the life of your blade. However it will not get as sharp as a professional sharpening service. I find that the 15 to 7 dollar sharpening service may be a hassle. I would rather just buy another 16 dollar blade after a year.      [[ASIN:B000LNB8HK Andis Cool Care Plus for Clipper Blades]] I think I may purchase this in the future. It is has fungicide and other bacteria killing ingredients. i feel this is good to use if you share your blade. It can also lubricate your blade as well.    As an African American, I never get razor bumps using this. Even if I let my hair grow back.    Extremely cost effective. 50 dollar trimmer that can last for a decade if cleaned properly. Blades are under 20 and can last to a year depending on frequency of use and lubrication. Those can also be sharpened as well. The oil can last for years since you only need 3 drops every time you use it. I hear some people just use the [[ASIN:B000LNB8HK Andis Cool Care Plus for Clipper Blades]] and do not use the oil. I know andis would probably want you to use both, but it would make sense to just use the big spray can.      Cons    It will not get close as a safety, strait, or foil shavers. However it will give a shave with a slight stubble.</li>
    <li> This product was alright but didn&#x27;t cut like I was hoping but the jobs done. I would buy the original</li>
    <li> very nice blades better than the ones that come from andis , looks alot better IMO. and they say that are rust proof</li>
    <li> good blade possibly better than original andis. i picked up a tip from another review that recommends not screwing the bolts in really tight, it helps keeping then just a bit loose. will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Shipped quicker than expected and product was intact and is cutting excellent.</li>
    <li> They do not edge that good zero gapped or strait out tha box I zero gapped one set of blades an left one set preset the preset want hardly cut at all an the zero gapped blades cut a lil better . I also brought the Andis deep tooth t out blade from atlanta barber supply they cut great I will not buy anymore promate blades</li>
    <li> I purchased this blade set for my [[ASIN:B000143C0K Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer]] after reading many positive reviews here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Once it was installed it worked well; however the guard on the [[ASIN:B001CHCF7G Pro-mate Trimmer Blade fits Andis T-Outliner]] prevents a close shave and snags. Compared to the blade set that came with my Andis trimmer, the Pro-mate blades were very disappointing. The Pro-mate blades leave the trimmed area about 2mm longer than the stock Andis blades. Additionally the teeth on the Pro-mate guard are closer together causing the hair to snag much more frequently than with the Andis. I can&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone planning to use it on an Andis trimmer.</li>
    <li> They work good but  honestly they would never be as sharp as my wahl detailier , those are the best liners!</li>
    <li> Great quality! This is a great product, trims nicely, and the gold look classy. Definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Iv been a barber for almost 20 years.. decided to give these a try, worst mistake ever! Actually I purchased 3 blades, so I felt 3 x stupid because all 3 promate blades were dull straight out of the package..total waste of $45</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d just get the andis blades because this didnt seem to fit and i tried everything but nothing would get this blade to cut.</li>
    <li> The primate blades work well but they were&#x27;nt the ones i ordered the ones i ordered has the good colored top blade the ones that were sent had the Black colored top blade, but they work o.k. So i have to rate 4 stars</li>
    <li> Purchased and installed this item on my andis outliner with expectation of great results. I was very disappointed after spending my time installing Pro-Mate blade. The five star rated exaggerated claims are very questionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Factory settings of close shave doesn&#x27;t even come close, even after few time going back and forth on the cheeks; the blade does not grab or cut all the hair under it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried adjusting the blade myself and was not satisfied with the outcome. Unfortunately i trashed my Original Andis blade, feeling very foolish now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not believe everything you read on reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to readjust the blade and if it makes positive difference, i will update my review along with the rating stars.</li>
    <li> I have used this blades for sometime now and I have found it to be far superior to any other on the market. I recommend this product to anyone who is a professional or an aspiring at home barber. The lines done with this product is BAR NONE. It also provides the ability to give a very close shave.</li>
    <li> I went with this blade after seeing the reviews that it meets the same standars as the ANDIS blades and it does.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months and the adjustments and feel are on part with the ANDIS blades, the Pro-mate actually feels a little more \\&quot;solid\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that didn&#x27;t work as well as the ANDIS blade is the shape of the hole didn&#x27;t really match and the driver doesn&#x27;t sit in all the way as it does with the ANDIS, this cause a slight increase in noise but not to fear once you screw everything back on, there&#x27;s no way the driver will come out of the socket.&lt;br /&gt;This might be specific to my T-outliner and if I really wanted to i could file down the driver for a better fit.&lt;br /&gt;All in all great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**EDIT**&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m editing my original feedback to report that once properly oiled the these blades are as quiet as the ANDIS, so I would definitely recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband he love it.</li>
    <li> I purchase these because from the reviews, it seemed that this product was state of the art hair cutting technology. The few negative reviews that are there, share the same sentiments I have after now trying the Pro-Mate blade myself. You may as well try lining up your hair with a potato. The stock andis blade that I purchased the pro-mate to replace, gets a much closer and cleaner cut, and I&#x27;ve had it for at least a year now. Don&#x27;t waste your time with these.</li>
    <li> These give you and extra crisp line-up, when blades are properly adjusted. These are THE blades to use with the Andis</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my particular blades that I got, but I&#x27;m not willing to buy again to try and find out. I have to spend far too much time trying to get the right tightness of the screws, otherwise if I tighten it too tight (normal tightness) the blades won&#x27;t even move/won&#x27;t cut. Too loose, and the blades move around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These suck. I would&#x27;ve written this sooner, but I was just lining my hair and said F it. I&#x27;m buying andi&#x27;s I&#x27;ve got school in a week.</li>
    <li> Not bad. Not sure I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s better than the factory blade. I do like the longer teeth but I don&#x27;t find it to cut any sharper. Also, my blade didn&#x27;t have the same color as the one pictured which is a copper color. Mine was a dark cast iron looking color.</li>
    <li> Deep tooth blade for sharper lines and edges...already comes zero-gapped from the factory no need to reset the blade!</li>
    <li> I tryed lining up my Lil boy and it wasn&#x27;t cutting the baby hairs I was so mad I need a sharp blade</li>
    <li> the blade its on even and from one side it cuts ppl</li>
    <li> They dont cut like the factory ones that came with the unit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems with this blade. While I find its not dull like some reviews state, promate hasn&#x27;t reinvented the wheel here. You could buy the manufacturer blade and be just as well off.</li>
    <li> I know this is a great blade it just takes some breaking in before you can get that precision edge. Hopefully you all can fix that going forward.</li>
    <li> Bought this blade for my Andis T-Outliner. I usually buy the Andis OEM blade but thought this would work just the same at a lesser price. Boy was I wrong. After installing the blade and oiling it up, I tried to bald my head like I have been doing with my T-Outliner for 5 years. This blade did not work! I couldn&#x27;t get all of the hair off of my head. It was a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended having to throw a hat on my half-shaved head and head to the Beauty Supply store to buy an Andis T-Outliner blade. I was lucky because it was New Year&#x27;s Eve and the beauty supply store was closing early. The Andis blade worked like a charm without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted this blade to work, but it did not. I&#x27;m sticking with the original from now on!</li>
    <li> I have had this pro mate blade for 2 years now, and it still works like new. I bought it when I dropped my original andis blade and it chipped. Over the course of 2 years I have dropped this blade several times(im a clumsy person) and there are no chips or scratches at all on this blade. Very high quality product, they cut just as good as the original stock blade, just way more durable.</li>
    <li> The blade is super sharp much sharper than the andis original blade.</li>
    <li> Love this blade it gets really close and leaves a really nice straight edge, I stopped going to the barbers after finding this blade and trimmer combo.</li>
    <li> Cut better than the original andis blades</li>
    <li> Was rather skeptical on purchasing this blade after reading all the reviews but I went ahead and bought them anyways. My newly purchased Andis t-outliners arrived a few days ago and I immediately installed these on the clippers. I installed them properly and used a few drops of Andis blade oil prior to dry shaving my beard. I am saddened to say that they did not trim my beard very good at all. It took some beard hair up to ten passes before I could get it to cut it off. It pulled on my hair and overall just felt extremely dull. I will be switching back to the stock Andis t-outlinner blade and would not recommend this blade.</li>
    <li> The blades worked nice but got to sharp later on down the line dont no if clippers have to be adjusted or what have problems whith them being to sharp i will say they do cut good but that was the only problem other thanthatthey fine</li>
    <li> Yeah bought this awhile ago and was disappointed. When I see/hear the description as set close I was thinking the blade would be set proper like a barber. What I was looking for was something that would give a really sharp edge. After installing I was better off just using my andis blade that came with the clipper. 5 oclock shadow after shaving with this blade. And thats with a clean, straight out the shower(dry of course) shave. Even worse on my head when trying to shave bald. Have to shave with a razor to get a clean shave on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When set proper it should take away 99% of hair with a touch. This blade needs to be ran over the same spot a few times. But leaves stubbly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only pro for me is that the way the blade is made it will not rust as fast as the andis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand everyone has different hair/texture/skin. If you have stubborn hair stay away and check out anivo products to get a sharp cut and a pro like adjustment on your blade. Unless you in a metro type city and can go to a sharpener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and if it helps, I groom dogs, and have access to sharpeners, cleaning supplies etc on a regular. If you dont mind stubbly hair, get the promate.</li>
    <li> this blade is literally duller than my two year old liner blade. i tried to line my friend up and it didnt even cut anything, i put it in the middle of my beard and it didnt even cut a line in it. all it does is pull and snag hair.</li>
    <li> was sooo stoked to get these bad boys and get right to work, and they didnt even cut.. im not sure if i need to re adjust them or what.. but my stock blade hits way crispy... i will try and mess with these though and see whats up... they did come really quick so 5 stars on quick shipping.. also they are like a gun metal grey, so they look dope! just hope i can get em to cut cool!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the pro-mate blade, I think it is a must have as a barber that may specialize in very detailed hair lining.</li>
    <li> I like how with pro-mate the blade doesn&#x27;t get hot quick, it stay cool longer. Its very sharp &amp; accurate. I uses less oil then the original blade. You have to give it a try it worth every cent.</li>
    <li> Seller was prompt, blades however, not so much. Had to switch back to andis. I&#x27;m sure this is a reflection of the brand, and not the seller.</li>
    <li> Dull and cheap...stick with andis blade...adjust andis easily for sharper blade</li>
    <li> I expected way better</li>
    <li> Best blade for the Andis Outliners!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been use Andis liner for almost 20years. First time I had a little problem to adjust it and contact the customer service toll free number printed in package and they advised to take out the tension screws and cover. After alI it works beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy original blade and stay with Pro-mate.</li>
    <li> i also bought the one for m3 styliner and its the best blade ive found but this one it just dont cut like the styliner one does</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve given these blades several tries in the 6 weeks I&#x27;ve had them. Adjusting and readjusting to no avail. They are either dull or defective.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no rookie owner and know how to maintain my 20 year old T-Outliner and its blades.&lt;br /&gt;I would have returned these but the return period had expired, which of course is my fault. In the future I may purchase another set but this time from the manufacturer. My purchase was from NG, Inc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATE****&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after writing the above review I was contacted by Isaac Hwang from Pro-mate customer service.&lt;br /&gt;I was told they would happily replace the defective /dull blades even though I purchased them from a third party. What? Wanna run that by me again? What company does that sort of thing. Pro-Mate, that&#x27;s who. After receiving my new blades I was able to see what all the fuss was about. Not sure how much closer they cut but they certainly stay cooler for a longer time. Pro-mate has a customer for life. 5 stars</li>
    <li> It did not fit my outliners and it wasn&#x27;t the same color. I feel like I wasted my money</li>
    <li> Nice blade. Good for shaving and shaping.</li>
    <li> Ive used a promate blade on my outliners for a few years and was very pleased. The replacment I purchased was inferior to my prior blade. The new blade is alot thicker and does not work well for balding as the last one did. Dont know if i received a dud or if theres a change in manufacturing.Like i said my first one was really good but this last one was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the money, so cheap &amp; they work amazing right out of the box !!</li>
    <li> It did not work as advertise.</li>
    <li> I installed the Blade on my T-Outliner and it did not work properly. I had trouble getting the blades to move smoothly; I also put oil and even loosen the screws on them to try make the baldes move back and forth. So, I ended up putting my old baldes back on. I think that the Pro-mate blades are a little too thick than the regular andis blades.. I&#x27;m going to reorder the original blades for them.</li>
    <li> If adjusted properly, these are some hard hitting blades. They attach to T-outliners the same way the original blade does. Takes some post purchase adjusting to the blades for them to cut precisely</li>
