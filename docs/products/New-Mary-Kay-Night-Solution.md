    <li> The product is good jar was damaged and top of pump is broken. I am just using it by unscrewing top of lid.  To much trouble to send back.. not sure if there is return policy or not.</li>
    <li> Great product ! And inexpensive package was great fast service and the product was new it is Mary Kay , think it was 12 dollars</li>
    <li> Great product! It&#x27;s the real thing!</li>
    <li> I honestly have no idea what this is supposed to do to your skin. It gives absolutely no moisture to my dry skin. I don&#x27;t like it at all. It seems to have no effect at all. What&#x27;s it for?</li>
    <li> I started using this product 3 years ago when i saw the beginnings of age lines. Since then those beginnings have disappeared and i constatly get \\&quot;There&#x27;s no way you are 27, you look much younger\\&quot; from people who truely mean it.</li>
    <li> Great product. I was tired of paying thirty dollars for it via Mary Kay so I gave this a shot and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
    <li> love this product. have used it for years! not heavy or sticky. hydrates. i love to use on and around my eyes because every other moisturizer makes them feel heavy and sticky or burns lol</li>
    <li> The shipping experience was good, and the item really worked for me, thanks.</li>
    <li> The product is brand new and placed in an official box and delivered on time as expected.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  Wish the price was better.  Mary Kay has great products... Will buy again..</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I now use it both in the morning and at night, since I can&#x27;t use the moisturizer I ordered. It does not leave my skin oily.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time works great</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for many years ... very happy with the result.  :-)</li>

    <li> Great product, received quickly!</li>
    <li> I used it for a week and saw a visible difference in the mirror. It behaves for me like a brightener. I do not think it is a wrinkle diminished or filler, but more of a pop of energy seen in my skin. Can&#x27;t explain it. You can pay Lancome for a product 3x more expensive, with a lot of hype. This has made a greater difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> After just a few days, I feel my face is clearer and very soft too</li>
    <li> I have used Mary Kay cosmetics for years and I really like this product.  I have noticed a difference in my skin and I like that the product is light and not heavy like some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, and this has nothing to due with the product, I sugggest you not purchase it from Buxom Beauty.</li>
