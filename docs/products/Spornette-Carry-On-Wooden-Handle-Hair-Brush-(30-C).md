      <li>Woohoo little best travel brush ever!</li>
      <li>Great for travel kits and also fine for daily use at home.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the best brush you&#x27;ll use, but it was fine for getting the knots out of my wavy hair for a few weeks.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are sturdy but comfortable.  </li>
      <li>It is compact and light weight for travel.  </li>
      <li>Great little travel hair brush...weighs almost nothing, packs easy...</li>
      <li>Needed a brush to carry with me in my bag, this is perfect small sleek design and durable, I&#x27;ve dropped it several times and its always clashing around in my bag yet still good as new</li>
      <li>Very good in my thick hair</li>
      <li>This small but effective brush works well on my fine, easily tangled hair.</li>
      <li>Handle shape is nice to hold and for some reason makes it easier to fit in my little travel makeup bag.  </li>
      <li>Easily packed, non-scratchy bristles, and a bit of natural materials.  </li>
      <li>I have long, thick, fine hair and this brush is pretty much perfect for my needs.  </li>
      <li>The brush is very well made and it was worth the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a real wooden handle, but it certainly feels like it, which is an excellent departure from all the plastic stuff everywhere today.  </li>
      <li>Best of all, it works!&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be looking for a new travel brush for years, but I will be buying a few Spornette Carry on Wooden</li>
      <li>Pretty much what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>This brush has done the job - lightweight, small, and good at brushing hair.</li>
      <li>I also am a big fan of the light weight and comfort.  </li>
      <li>So the center bristles stick out more than the outer ones.  </li>
      <li>I really took a chance when I ordered this item.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended for hair-conscious travelers!</li>
      <li>Much nicer looking than the plastic neon travel brushes.</li>
      <li>Also fine for the wife&#x27;s long hair.</li>
      <li>not bad, but I am still looking for a smaller one.</li>
      <li>Despite the wind, snow and rain this always detangles painlessly and quickly when I step back inside.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s about 6 inches long, so it&#x27;s not the smallest brush out there and won&#x27;t fit in a little evening clutch bag, but it&#x27;s definitely much stronger than a lot of the cheap plastic</li>
      <li>So ultimately, I have a hard time finding good hair brushes for my hair</li>
      <li>I have short hair, so when I use this brush, only the bristles in the center are effective.  </li>
      <li>Compact and strong, this little brush had no problems removing tangles and styling my hair during a three week trip globetrotting.</li>
      <li>Nice to use, the bristles are not sharp or pointy, just firm enough to set the hair.</li>
      <li>Great size for small purses or travel carry on, and the shape helps control the small handle.</li>
      <li>I also thought a smaller brush that wouldn&#x27;t take up so much of my shaving kit.  </li>
      <li>Great for touch-ups, even for that unfortunate kid with frizzy locks!</li>
      <li>Brush works very well and small enough to fit in your purse.</li>
      <li>The price is the only disadvantage, as there is an very close all plastic version being sold called the Nexxus Style Effexx Travel, which is much, much cheaper but doesn&#x27;t have the looks or the comfort, but essentially the same functionality.  </li>
      <li>Much lighter than I expected.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s considerably lighter than the plastic handle brush of the same size it&#x27;s replacing.  </li>
      <li>The short handle becomes a natural extension of ones hand.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s small and super lightweight.  </li>

<li> The previous brush was such high quality none of the bristles were broken.  </li>

    <li> Excellent quality, sturdy wooden handle and strong brush bristles in a compact, travel-size hairbrush. It&#x27;s about 6 inches long, so it&#x27;s not the smallest brush out there and won&#x27;t fit in a little evening clutch bag, but it&#x27;s definitely much stronger than a lot of the cheap plastic, tinier travel brushes on the market.</li>
    <li> Ergonomic in the hand and comfortable on the scalp, attractive, and a great size (for both travel and everyday use).  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Very good in my thick hair</li>
    <li> I needed a tiny brush for my carry-on.  This did the trick!  It&#x27;s not the best brush you&#x27;ll use, but it was fine for getting the knots out of my wavy hair for a few weeks.  Planning on using this for travel in the future.</li>
    <li> I really took a chance when I ordered this item.  Often, the brush bristles cause the hair to tangle, but I have been really happy with the results.  It is compact and light weight for travel.  It glides through my fine hair with ease and does not cause fly away hair.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great size for small purses or travel carry on, and the shape helps control the small handle. The brush is very well made and it was worth the price.</li>
    <li> I hate packing everything bathroom-related when I travel for work. So I search for small sizes of items to keep in a bag that I can just grab and go. This bruch is the size of my hand, fits perfetly in my bathroom travel bag, and detangles during travel when I need it.</li>
    <li> Small, travel size brush. Nice to use, the bristles are not sharp or pointy, just firm enough to set the hair. Also fine for the wife&#x27;s long hair. Great for travel kits and also fine for daily use at home.</li>
    <li> Most of the other reviewers covered it, but I&#x27;m adding in that I have VERY thick, curly hair, and travel brushes usually just get caught in it and make me want to cry. I was skeptical of this one, but it is excellent, fits in the hand nicely, and does its job! Woohoo little best travel brush ever!</li>
    <li> The handle on the brush is very comfortable.  It is very light.  Much lighter than I expected.  It&#x27;s considerably lighter than the plastic handle brush of the same size it&#x27;s replacing.  The bristles are sturdy but comfortable.  I knocked off a star because the face of the brush is curved (length wise).  So the center bristles stick out more than the outer ones.  This is a common feature on full size brushes but this brush is relatively small.  I have short hair, so when I use this brush, only the bristles in the center are effective.  Or the end if I tilt the brush. So for me, I only get to use about a third to half of the bristles.</li>
    <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t feel like someone is yanking on your hair.  It&#x27;s small and super lightweight.  So much better than the fold-up hairbrushes.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly in your purse and very, very stylish.</li>
    <li> Compact and strong, this little brush had no problems removing tangles and styling my hair during a three week trip globetrotting.</li>
    <li> A little nicer than your basic travel drugstore hairbrush.  Handle shape is nice to hold and for some reason makes it easier to fit in my little travel makeup bag.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> No hole at the base, but I much prefer there not to be.  Great little brush that fits in my purse perfectly!</li>
    <li> This is a small purse size brush that pulls no hairs. Great for touch-ups, even for that unfortunate kid with frizzy locks!</li>
    <li> My favorite travel brush ever.</li>
    <li> Well constructed brush and it fits perfectly in my purse. I was surprised by how difficult it was to find a &amp;#34;travel size&amp;#34; brush and have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of this brush.</li>
    <li> This brush has done the job - lightweight, small, and good at brushing hair.</li>
    <li> Nice brush, very pretty rich, reddish color. Made of wood and curved for a stylish and sophisticated look. Brush works very well and small enough to fit in your purse. Great find. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Very nice compact brush</li>
    <li> Great little travel hair brush...weighs almost nothing, packs easy...</li>
    <li> I have medium-length hair and used the brush for a couple of days on vacation before the black bristle part completely came out of the brush. I put it back in the wooden part and it came out again, rendering it useless for the rest of the vacation. This brush would serve its purpose for people with short or thin hair, but it didn&#x27;t hold up to my hair.</li>
    <li> This small but effective brush works well on my fine, easily tangled hair. It fits nicely in my travel toiletry bag, and would work great in my purse too.</li>
    <li> Easily packed, non-scratchy bristles, and a bit of natural materials.  Pretty much what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would have been slightly smaller. The overall length is 5-3/4 inches. not bad, but I am still looking for a smaller one.</li>
    <li> Love this, great size for travel plus works just great on my fine hair. Was trying to ding something small so I wouldn&#x27;t have to drag the Aveda brush along on my trip. I like it so well I use it most of the time!</li>
    <li> Good quality and travel friendly. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My travel brush was nearing the end of its usefulness but I couldn&#x27;t find one what I thought would be a suitable replacement.  I also thought a smaller brush that wouldn&#x27;t take up so much of my shaving kit.  The write-ups on this product caught my eye.  It seemed to fit my needs, although I frankly could not understand how some people could be soo enthusiastic about a hairbrush.  Well, here I am raving about a hairbrush.&lt;br /&gt;It is a perfect size for travel.  It looks very classy, and its unique shape fits one&#x27;s hand perfectly.  Best of all, it works!&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be looking for a new travel brush for years, but I will be buying a few Spornette Carry on Wooden handle hair brushes as Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> Needed a brush to carry with me in my bag, this is perfect small sleek design and durable, I&#x27;ve dropped it several times and its always clashing around in my bag yet still good as new</li>
    <li> I picked up this brush at Paddington Station in London back in 2004.  There was a hair cutting shop selling them on the top floor and I had never seen so many drunken men in suits passed out in a train station.  However, I was in desperate need for a quality haircut in an English speaking nation abroad, so these circumstances led to my discovery of this little hair gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward about a decade later and my beloved brush had somehow disappeared over the years.  I kept looking for a similar brush from time to time and finally it appeared in my Amazon search.  My wife, who at the time was my girlfriend on that business trip to London was also thrilled that I rediscovered this brush.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a real wooden handle, but it certainly feels like it, which is an excellent departure from all the plastic stuff everywhere today.  The previous brush was such high quality none of the bristles were broken.  I also am a big fan of the light weight and comfort.  The short handle becomes a natural extension of ones hand.  Our daughter also likes the brush and tries to use it, so the small size is an advantage with younger children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps with your decision.  The price is the only disadvantage, as there is an very close all plastic version being sold called the Nexxus Style Effexx Travel, which is much, much cheaper but doesn&#x27;t have the looks or the comfort, but essentially the same functionality.  (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KV57CI/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o03_s00_i00)</li>
    <li> For reference, I have thin straight hair. Medium length. It is bleached from black to white and sometimes dyed with semi permanent dye. It tangles easily. So ultimately, I have a hard time finding good hair brushes for my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for carrying around in my backpack or purse when I am at school. It is the perfect size and the wood is a nice rich ruddy color as pictured. Much nicer looking than the plastic neon travel brushes. Frankly, what can I say? It works great! It doesn&#x27;t create static or frizz. It detangles very nicely and painlessly. I go to a college in a city with notoriously bad weather. Despite the wind, snow and rain this always detangles painlessly and quickly when I step back inside. Creates volume when I want it to and smooths down the hair when I want it to. I find it works better than the full size brush I keep at my vanity. Cleans easily too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy it again and would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, fine hair and this brush is pretty much perfect for my needs.  (Semi) affordable, compact, sturdy, quality.  Way easier to travel with than my giant paddle brush, but doesn&#x27;t collapse on me (like those terrible round foldable ones) or snag.  Highly recommended for hair-conscious travelers!</li>
    <li> Great brush - just the right size and doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> Great hair brush for both men and women, good travel size.  Let&#x27;s travel in style with proper grooming, bring your gel too!</li>
    <li> My grand-daughter has fine curly hair. Her mom (my loving daughter) was using a plastic bristle brush and poor little girl was crying every morning. When I visited them I brought my Aveda hairbrush and used it on my grand-daughter. No tears!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to buy her one just like mine, but they are over $30.. so I found this. I ordered and had it shipped to their house (I am in Portland and they are in Los Angeles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter said that when the package arrived the little one said \\&quot;this looks like it is for me! It is small.\\&quot; (she is 3 1/2).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter said it works wonderful and now the little one is learning to brush her own hair.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! I bought it to brush my toddler&#x27;s hair and it&#x27;s the perfect size for her hair. Great quality bristles and handle. I bought another to take to the gym with me.</li>
    <li> great brush.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This mini brush is a disappointment. It&#x27;s chunky shape and rubber bristles just don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
