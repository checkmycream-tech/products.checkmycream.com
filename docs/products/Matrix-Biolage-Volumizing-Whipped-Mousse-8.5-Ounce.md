    <li> I was not very happy with this mousse, i had used it before and it just wasn&#x27;t the same. My hair felt very damaged after using this.</li>
    <li> It became liquid and did not work after a few uses.  Then it tells me it is non-returnable.  Do not order this.  I never pay this for mousse, but I thought it would be really good.  I would like my money back, but . . .</li>
    <li> Biolage makes the greatest products for people with thin hair. It makes it so much fuller.</li>
    <li> I do not like this mouse.  It is sticky and feels awful on my hair.  I liked the old mouse better - it worked why did Matrix change this.  I have read a lot of reviews on line and they all say the say the same.  No one likes it.</li>
    <li> My hair is frizzy,coarse and fly away. This mousse is wonderful in controlling all three. The only thing that would make this better is a less expensive price tag&lt;br /&gt;denise</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and frizzy and after using just a little bit, my hair felt dirty, dry and weighed down. Total Results Amplify is much better. I definitely won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> it is a good mousse and helps maintain hair atyle</li>
    <li> I ordered this product from Integrity Sales twice.  The first time I received Matrix Biolage Styling Blue Agave Whipped Volume BODIFYING Mousse instead.  I figured it was an honest mistake so I gave the Agave a try, but I don&#x27;t like it as much as the volumizing mousse for my fine hair.  So I ordered the volumizing mousse again, but found out it was not an honest mistake.  It is a case of false advertising.  Bait you with the Volumizing mousse, then dump the Agave Bodifying mousse in your order.  Now I&#x27;m stuck with 2 more Agave mousse that Amazon says I can&#x27;t return because it&#x27;s considered a hazadarous material.  Lesson learned.  If you want the volumizing mousse, don&#x27;t order form this vendor.  They are prompt with shipping, which earned them 2 stars instead of 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 6/30/14 - The seller has apologized and said this was an unintentional mistake based on an incorrect UPC on Amazon. They are providing me a full refund even though I cannot return the product.  I switched my rating from a 2 to 4 star for customer service.</li>
    <li> This is a terrible formulation!  I will definitely be disposing of this (as it is considered &#x27;hazardous&#x27; and cannot be returned!) and will not buy it again.  It smells terrible, acts terrible, it&#x27;s just awful!  I&#x27;m so sad to see this as a replacement to a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Very good expercience. I do recommend!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Matrix Biolage Voluminzing Whipped Mousse as pictured but received the Matrix Biolage Blue Agave Whipped mousse instead. This was disappointing since they appear to have discontinued the brand that I ordered. I thought that I had found cans that was still available. I do not like the Blue Agave mousse. It does not provide the same results. It leaves my hair heavy and sticky. My 2 star rating is based on the Blue Agave mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spoke with an Amazon representative and they issued a refund so I am happy with how this turned out.  5 stars for the refund process.&lt;br /&gt;Please be aware when ordering this item that you may not receive what is pictured.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the one pictured there. Was a different bottle and the mousse was way more sticky. Won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
    <li> It works really well and the smell is tolerable. So many fragrances associated with hair products are just awful, but this one is fine. Will certainly buy it again.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and not too heavy for my very fine straight haie.</li>
    <li> It fizzed out and was liquidity instead of mousse body.  I would not order it again.&lt;br /&gt;it was not cheap.</li>
    <li> makes your hair full not dry or sticky no build up . a great product if you want to give your hair some added bounce</li>
