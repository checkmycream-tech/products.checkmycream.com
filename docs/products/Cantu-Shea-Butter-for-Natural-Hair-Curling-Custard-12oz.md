      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been more than fair in giving this product a shot.</li>

      <li>My hair came out really nice with bouncy curls</li>
      <li>(well, to be fair, I found the odor of the No Drip Hair and Scalp Oil to be too strong for my tastes, but that&#x27;s another story).</li>

      <li>I wish I had read the reviews here first because some one said they should&#x27;ve rolled around in grass an chalk lol</li>
      <li>Then when I tried to separate the curls to get more volume, thats when it started flaking.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>As a matter of fact &amp;#34;flakes&amp;#34; is not even the word...  more like baby powder in my hair.  </li>
      <li>I would have been better off with Eco-styler or Ampro, quite frankly.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful which is pretty much</li>
      <li>This product defined my bantu knot out really well and gave it a great shine as well as a nice, soft hold.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and defines your curls very well...</li>
      <li>i have mixed hair and this sucked lol.</li>
      <li>I finger detangled, then added a light water mist.  </li>
      <li>first clue was that I had great difficulty in locating it in a store near me.</li>
      <li>At first it looked okay.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to use it and worked on my twist out immediately.</li>
      <li>Ok so people having flaking issues with this product may be usung too much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my understanding that this product underwent a rebranding sometime ago and formerly received good reviews.</li>
      <li>: It&#x27;s my understanding that this product underwent a rebranding sometime ago and formerly received good reviews.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a longtime loyal Cantu customer.</li>
      <li>I have super frizzy 3b/3a hair</li>
      <li>But, I really do think it is a very good product for Black hair.</li>
      <li>worth the price</li>
      <li>it on freshly washed and conditioned hair&lt;br /&gt;*Used</li>
      <li>It only smells nice</li>
      <li>I love the Cantu line in general but this product was not for me.</li>
      <li>The white stuff or the residue was still in my hair for a full week but the good thing is my curls where still tight and lovely.</li>
      <li>This was among my first products I bought for a twist out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve since cut a lot of my hair off, and the curls are coming back for the most part.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this product........</li>
      <li>I used a small amount of this product on top of the cantu shine and hold mist (which I love)</li>
      <li>So best advice is go slow on the product don&#x27;t be too excited and also on the product it says to use it on soaking wet hair</li>
      <li>It was originally marketed as Natural Hair Curling Custard.</li>
      <li>It was originally marketed as Natural Hair Curling Custard.</li>
      <li>This was soo flaky, and at first I thought it was because I didn&#x27;t have my hair wet, ok, my mistake.</li>
      <li>So I end up rinsing the whole style out.</li>
      <li>and it works very well with the eco gel.</li>
      <li>Make sure you hair is wet</li>
      <li>For those who have flaking you are either using too much or using it with a product it does not mix well with (I used my Cantu leave in conditioner).</li>
      <li>I really just need to toss it.</li>
      <li>You would be better off just taking wet hair and rolling around on grass and chalk on the sidewalk.</li>
      <li>but.... It was full of residue, a lot of white stuff in my hair its like I had gotten a piece of chalk and just rubbed the whole thing in my hair.</li>
      <li>I understand the concept of gel cast, so I even tried to work out the dryness and stiffness with a little oil, more of the Curl Activator Cream, some of the Creamy Hair Lotion, and the Coconut Oil Shine and Hold Mist.</li>
      <li>Their track record with their other products strongly supports my assertion.  </li>
      <li>So it was to my great surprise that I found this product to be a fail by every measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just made sure to scrunch my hair while it was drying and after it dried to loosen it up</li>
      <li>maybe I got a little too excited and used too much product.</li>
      <li>I was really excited to use this product on my daughters hair but to my surprise it was extremely flaky and the curls were gone by morning.</li>
      <li>So the next week I used it this time with soaking wet hair and little product which turned out good.</li>
      <li>I have natural 3c hair.</li>
      <li>I used this product on a 4 day old twist out.....  </li>
      <li>Also, the ingredient list does not read like a natural product.</li>
      <li>I have natural 4B hair.</li>
      <li>I have natural hair that&#x27;s never been permed.</li>
      <li>When I took it out my hair was shiny but dry yet pretty defined</li>
      <li>That evening, when I washed my hair: my curls has turned into straight, frizzy clumps--as if I had burned my hair with a flat iron.</li>
      <li>Each time I had to reshampoo and condition my hair to get it back to its normal soft, manageable, and sheeny state.</li>
      <li>Barely any curl definition, flakes, and nothing in comparison to eco styler gel.</li>
      <li>Their track record with their other products strongly supports my assertion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair type: 4a with a little 4b at the temples and crown</li>
      <li>Along with this, the many other negative reviews that I&#x27;ve seen online let me know that I&#x27;m not alone in my dissatisfaction.</li>
      <li>Along with this, the many other negative reviews that I&#x27;ve seen online let me know that I&#x27;m not alone in my dissatisfaction.</li>
      <li>so I was surprised the product held my hair for that long.</li>
      <li>Used it for the first time a few days ago</li>
      <li>The first time I disregard the directions and applied it on dry hair to make flat double-strand twists over night and let it dry over night.</li>
      <li>Hair was stiff, dry and full of white flakes...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product was originally named &amp;#34;curling custard&amp;#34; and I absolutely loved it! This is the only styling product I would use. When I ran out and purchased this &amp;#34;define and shine&amp;#34;, the results were awful. My hair had no definition and my braid outs didn&#x27;t last past the first day. I don&#x27;t  know what changed but I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time a few days ago and I love it!!! My hair looks great, I&#x27;m seeing a lot of people saying flakes but I didn&#x27;t have that problem... My hair was very wet when I put it in, I also used hair milk then added the cantu. I air dry my hair.. No problems.. It&#x27;s now 4 days later and my curls are still extremely defined. I love it</li>
    <li> I purchased this product along with the leave in for my 4c hair and i am sadly disappointed. Barely any curl definition, flakes, and nothing in comparison to eco styler gel.</li>
    <li> Ive NEVER written a review for a product before. Smh I should have read the reviews before I picked this up. DO NOT BUY ! I absolutely hate it. The flaking is horrendous. Makes my hair look dirty and I&#x27;m so mad bc I used it for a twist out frohawk. The hawk came out perfect but my hair looks disgusting and I have no time to wash it out. What a waster.</li>
    <li> My hair is hard and stiff I have to wash out! Horrible</li>
    <li> This curling custard went on wonderful, however it leaves a horrible&lt;br /&gt;Residue on your hair. It smells nice and defines your curls very well... I just can&#x27;t tolerant the film it leaves behind.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I use other products in the Cantu line. I used this along with the Cantu Curl Cream and put cold wave rods into my hair. After my hari was dry and I removed the rods, there was so much white residue on each curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be using this product again.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to use this product on my daughters hair but to my surprise it was extremely flaky and the curls were gone by morning. Hair was stiff, dry and full of white flakes...had to rewash her hair...wouldnt use this again..</li>
    <li> You would be better off just taking wet hair and rolling around on grass and chalk on the sidewalk. This makes your hair crusty and hard. You will look dirty like you have Psoriasis scalp. There is no way they tested this product before putting it on the market. Buyer beware. I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I used this on wet hair and after it dried my curls were all flaky. I do not recommend this. It only smells nice</li>
    <li> This product should receive no stars from me. I have curly/wavy hair, and this stuff fried my hair like a bad perm. Granted, I did use it in conjunction with another type of curling gel on my wet hair. Throughout the day, I notice that my hair was very stiff, but thought nothing of it. That evening, when I washed my hair: my curls has turned into straight, frizzy clumps--as if I had burned my hair with a flat iron. I tried everything. Bananas, eggs, yogurt, protein treatments. My curls were gone. I&#x27;ve since cut a lot of my hair off, and the curls are coming back for the most part. There are a few areas in which I did not cut off enough hair, and it still looks fried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed. Also, the ingredient list does not read like a natural product. There are plent of unfamiliar and non-pronounceable ingredients. I say beware. I would have been better off with Eco-styler or Ampro, quite frankly.</li>
    <li> The one star is strictly for the definition this product gave my curls. Other than that, I would never use this product again because, like....I wish I had read the reviews here first because some one said they should&#x27;ve rolled around in grass an chalk lol and I thought basically the same thing!!</li>
    <li> Flake really bad dont wasted your money</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even believe that I&#x27;m typing this -- this is the only Cantu product that I&#x27;ve ever found that I don&#x27;t like. I&#x27;m a longtime loyal Cantu customer. I&#x27;ve fulfilled every one of my hair needs through the Cantu line: cleansing, conditioning, moisturizing, sealing, and styling. My hair and scalp have never been happier. So it was to my great surprise that I found this product to be a fail by every measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first clue was that I had great difficulty in locating it in a store near me. When I finally found it I really expected, due to its consistency and hype, to achieve results very similar to that of the Kinky-Curly Curling Custard. Boy, was I ever wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been more than fair in giving this product a shot. I&#x27;ve tried a variety of techniques and product combinations to try to achieve good results. I&#x27;ve:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Used it in combination with the Moisturizing Curl Activator Cream (an excellent product)&lt;br /&gt;*Used it in combination with the Moisturizing Curl Activator Cream AND the Leave-In Conditioning Hair Repair Cream&lt;br /&gt;*Used it in combination with coconut oil&lt;br /&gt;*Used it alone&lt;br /&gt;*Used it on soaking wet hair&lt;br /&gt;*Used it on damp hair&lt;br /&gt;*Used it on dry hair&lt;br /&gt;*Used it on freshly washed and conditioned hair&lt;br /&gt;*Used it sparingly&lt;br /&gt;*Used it generously&lt;br /&gt;*Let it air dry&lt;br /&gt;*Diffused it dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just really not sure that I could have used it in any other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EACH TIME, no matter what I did, I had the same results. My hair was dry, stiff, and lacked sheen. It felt like straw and my curls were shrunken. I understand the concept of gel cast, so I even tried to work out the dryness and stiffness with a little oil, more of the Curl Activator Cream, some of the Creamy Hair Lotion, and the Coconut Oil Shine and Hold Mist. No luck. Each time I had to reshampoo and condition my hair to get it back to its normal soft, manageable, and sheeny state. My scalp even felt dry and itchy when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be a case of &#x27;not everything is for everybody.&#x27; I doubt it though. I&#x27;m not even going to try and concede that maybe I used the product wrong as I, as stated above, used a variety of methods to get it to work as marketed. Along with this, the many other negative reviews that I&#x27;ve seen online let me know that I&#x27;m not alone in my dissatisfaction. Not sure what&#x27;s going on here. Cantu produces an excellent line that addresses the needs of naturals very well. Until this point, I&#x27;ve never met a Cantu product that I didn&#x27;t like (well, to be fair, I found the odor of the No Drip Hair and Scalp Oil to be too strong for my tastes, but that&#x27;s another story). I&#x27;m hoping that Cantu will work to reformulate this to be more effective. I know they can do it!

    <li> WHOAH...OMG... ..this product FLAKES!.  As a matter of fact &amp;#34;flakes&amp;#34; is not even the word...  more like baby powder in my hair.  I put it in my hair in the morning and gee I had to wash it out that same evening.  At first it looked okay.  However towards the end of the day the curls were extremely hard and if I tried to separate the curls it would break my hair (it&#x27;s like the black gel type of hard).  Then when I tried to separate the curls to get more volume, thats when it started flaking.  It&#x27;s weird because it looks fine until you mess with the curls or try to separate them.  I guess the flakes are inside of the curls -- so weird!!!  Only wish I had listen to all the reviews here.  But no... I just had to go and buy it.  Won&#x27;t be buying this again!!!!</li>
    <li> This products have my hair flawless... For those who have flaking you are either using too much or using it with a product it does not mix well with (I used my Cantu leave in conditioner). It will cause your curls to get a little hard but ANY curling custard will. It&#x27;s not crunchy hard it&#x27;s bareable. If it gets too hard you used too much. I just made sure to scrunch my hair while it was drying and after it dried to loosen it up and it worked perfectly! I have super frizzy 3b/3a hair and this product has my curls LAID! It also helped with my shrinkage!</li>
    <li> It does give great hold. But each time I used this product, I get flakes. Terrible flakes! So I end up rinsing the whole style out. Not to mention my hair gets really stiff. It smells wonderful which is pretty much all this product has going for itself. I love the Cantu line in general but this product was not for me. I have natural hair that&#x27;s never been permed. I tried different variations of style, product saturation, drying method... but the result was always the same. Crunchy, flaky curls.</li>
    <li> This can ONLY be applied on soaking wet hair! The first time I disregard the directions and applied it on dry hair to make flat double-strand twists over night and let it dry over night. When I took it out my hair was shiny but dry yet pretty defined but there was A LOT of white thick residue left. So the next time I use it on soaking wet hair, thinking it would work and still was left with that white residue! Yuck! I&#x27;m going to add this to water in a spray bottle, maybe it won&#x27;t be so bad!</li>
    <li> This product defined my bantu knot out really well and gave it a great shine as well as a nice, soft hold. However, it flakes something awful. I used a small amount of this product on top of the cantu shine and hold mist (which I love) and it still flaked, so its not that Im mixing it with incompatible products. Its just a product that flakes. I have natural 4B hair.</li>
    <li> Sticky, flaky, obnoxiously smelly.</li>
    <li> I used this product on a 4 day old twist out.....  I finger detangled, then added a light water mist.  Then I applied a good amount (not saturated!) and did flat twists.  It turned out perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My curls were a bit stiff when I took them down but, as the day progressed they relaxed and were very soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product........ I used it alone. It will cause flakiness after drying. Tried it a second time, but I applied a small amount of oil moisturizer first....... then applied curling custard and didn&#x27;t see flakiness after drying. Any oil moisturizer will do or maybe one of their other products that is a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Made my hair flak extremely bad</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. To avoid flaking and build-up I thoroughly rinse my hair with water each day</li>
    <li> Horrible dont use it!!!Didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon,got it at Wal-Mart.I used it for a braid out on me and my daughter hair.It made it hard and it was unbelievably flaky.Had to re wash our hair,because it was soo bad.It&#x27;s in my closest haven&#x27;t touched it I really just need to toss it.Atleast this product didn&#x27;t cost alot!!</li>
    <li> 3b/3c hair used after cowashing with a little conditioner left in. It melts into the instantly smoothing down frizz. It does dry a little crunchy but after scrunching and fluffing the hair... perfect smooth light bouncy curls!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t purchase! Flakes really bad!!!! The star is only for definition. But what&#x27;s the point if you&#x27;re looking like a commercial for Head and Shoulders.</li>
    <li> Ok so people having flaking issues with this product may be usung too much. I have natural 3c hair. After a cowash I take a small amount of this and massage through my hair. My hair is very thick and shoulder length and I use only about a quarter size. I have had no flaking and my curls stand the test of time. Not even crunchy or hard. Sometimes I even add coconut oil when put this in just for good measure. It&#x27;s not the way the directions say to use but it works the way I use it.</li>
    <li> Tried it twice and after the second time I made the decision that I was no longer going to try this product. It left my hair extremely hard and flakey.</li>
    <li> Question: Why put the word shea butter on this project when it does not have it.  Check it out.  Take a magnifying class to the list of ingredients (they make it that hard to read). Look at what they are calling shea butter.  The No. 5 ingredient is a chemical Butyrospermum.  Deceptive.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I didn&#x27;t want to pay a ton for Crew pomade, it works great for slicked 30&#x27;s 40&#x27;s vintage hairstyles, smells good, no flaking? Not sure why people said it did, must be using way too much. There are a ton of different oilds in here, including macadamia and has silk proteins. NICE! worth the price and you get a ton of it.</li>
    <li> This was among my first products I bought for a twist out. I didn&#x27;t buy mine here on Amazon I bought mine from a nearby cvs store. I was excited to use it and worked on my twist out immediately. My hair came out really nice with bouncy curls but.... It was full of residue, a lot of white stuff in my hair its like I had gotten a piece of chalk and just rubbed the whole thing in my hair. Good thing I didn&#x27;t have school the next day and was not planning on going anywhere the next day or even in a week.So this was over the summer and I just decided to keep my hair like that because I really liked the curls and I wanted to have my hairstyle for at least a week or so. The white stuff or the residue was still in my hair for a full week but the good thing is my curls where still tight and lovely. I have short 4c hair which is about 4 inches so I was surprised the product held my hair for that long. I give the product 4 stars because of the residue it left. It looked nasty someone would think you haven&#x27;t washed your hair in ages yet it was product. And I came to think of it maybe I got a little too excited and used too much product. So the next week I used it this time with soaking wet hair and little product which turned out good. So best advice is go slow on the product don&#x27;t be too excited and also on the product it says to use it on soaking wet hair so keep that in mind and btw I didn&#x27;t have to use gel while I was using this so that&#x27;s a plus for me 😃</li>
    <li> Just started using it.  Make sure you hair is wet and you come through it, because it can dry very hard.  But, I really do think it is a very good product for Black hair.</li>
    <li> This was soo flaky, and at first I thought it was because I didn&#x27;t have my hair wet, ok, my mistake. But even after I followed the directions correctly it flaked so bad, I thought it snowed in my hair. I definitely would not recommend this product, and it&#x27;s rather disappointing because I love all of Cantu products.</li>
    <li> this made my curls very stiff. also made my curls shrink up extremly bad!!! when it dried and i tried to crunch out the dry cast and white flakes came flying out every time i touched it!!!! i have mixed hair and this sucked lol. i got africans pride pudding and it works very well with the eco gel. I have the olive oil eco gel and it works great with the africans pride product! no flakes and it elongates my curls</li>
