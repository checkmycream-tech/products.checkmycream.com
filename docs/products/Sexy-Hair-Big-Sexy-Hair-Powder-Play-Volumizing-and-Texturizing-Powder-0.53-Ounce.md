<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing product. Just sprinkle a small amount at the roots of your dry hair and the lift and hold are amazing!  My curly hair has thinned with age and this really adds a ton of volume. Like most women, I am sometimes disappointed when products dont live up to their adverised hype.  You will not be disappointed with this. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Hair feels weird and it&#x27;s really difficult to wash out. And it makes my hair incredibly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it does work. Very well. I use a very little put of it on my (short) hair and it then use my usual styling wax on top. Gives a lot of grip and makes my hair far more manageable all day. Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this product. That is all.</li>
    <li> Before using this product, I would normally just spray my roots with hairspray and backcomb to get some volume at my roots, but after a couple days I&#x27;d have to wash my hair because the hairspray would flake up and look like dandruff. This stuff is great- I can usually get two days of styling with one use. I sprinkle it in the under layers of my roots and backcomb with a teasing brush and I get awesome volume- way better than hairspray, a lot less build-up. You only need a very small amount of this stuff to do the job- too much would probably make your hair sticky and unmanageable. The small size will last me for awhile and I have very long, thick hair.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to explain how amazing this stuff is! Thank you to my hair dresser for introducing me to it!! Wish I&#x27;d have known about it years ago!! If you love &amp;#34;big hair&amp;#34; and/or love to &amp;#34;tease&amp;#34; your hair, this stuff is for you!! Amazing stuff! Def recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Work well, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so small!</li>
    <li> Gives good volume but makes fine hair very heavy and greasy. Will not be purchasing again for my self.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. doesnt make hair powdery or anything. Gives tons of long lasting volume and does weigh hair down like other products. Easy to use. I &amp;#60;3 it!</li>
    <li> My stylist (new stylist) calls this \\&quot;pixie dust\\&quot; for your hair, and she&#x27;s right on the money. I&#x27;ve worn my hair short for several months and didn&#x27;t like waxes or pomades. Too greasy or sticky or both. My hair fell flat and hairspray didn&#x27;t help. This stuff is AMAZING!  A little goes a long way and I don&#x27;t need hardly any hairspray at all. Sprinkle on your dry roots and fluff it through. Holds my whispy bits in place and lifts my fringe so it&#x27;s not plastered onto my forehead. Lasts all day. My hair is like Jamie Lee Curtis short and this works wonders.</li>
    <li> Whether my hair is straight down, or teasing it, I instantly feel my hair getting bigger. Just a shake and rough up with your fingers and you have sassy hair.</li>
    <li> This must be an industry secret.  I saw it on a blog done by a hairdresser and you will LOVE this product.  Just a dash goes a long, long way. My mother&#x27;s also been using it and even in a high humidity area the volume on her short bob was amazing!</li>
    <li> I have very silky shiny hair, it never had any body until I used this product.  Shake a little on your roots and rub your hair back and forth and instant volume.  Love this!!  Can&#x27;t live without it.  Arrived quickly and seems to be the real stuff, not imitation.</li>
    <li> This is the coolest stuff! It really does feel cold when you sprinkle it on your head. Perfect for adding volume and texture to fine, thin hair.</li>
    <li> A little sprinkle and back combing of the roots and you&#x27;re good to go. This product provides volume and lift for fine hair.</li>
    <li> This product does what it claims, volumizing and texturizing my hair, which is naturally straight. However, it does not have &amp;#34;no product feel&amp;#34; as it claims. In fact, it is the opposite. You can definitely feel the product in your hair, more than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used. It sits on your scalp and makes your hair feel &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; (which is why it works), but I would never want anyone touching my hair with this stuff on it. Gross. Plus it&#x27;s hard to wash out, like others have said. So, I still use it on occasion, when my hair is already dirty but needs a little boost (and I know no one will be touching it), but I will not buy it again. There are better products out there; I just have to find them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of texturizing powders and this one was one of the best. It doesn&#x27;t leave that white residue in your hair. I think the trick is to really fluff your hair out afterwards. It leaves my hair voluminous at the roots even after airdrying.</li>
    <li> First off - I have naturally flat, thin, and bodyless hair.  I initially was told about this product by my hairdresser because most products make my hair look greasy, dingy, or only works for an hour or so.  The only other product that I use on my hair is a heat protector as I use a straight iron on a regular basis.  I only have to use a sprinkle of this stuff to have instant volume at the roots.  I put a dash on the tip of my fingers and rub it by my scalp at the folicles near the top of my head.  This lasts me all day and even if I put on a winter hat I can get the volume back by re-massaging at the scalp to give it a boost.</li>
    <li> Adds some volume but didn&#x27;t do as well as I thought it would. Left my hair feeling weird and chalky.</li>
    <li> Surprised by how well this works</li>
    <li> Has changed my life--hair always has body!!!!</li>
    <li> This really adds volume to my a line bob.  Remember a little goes a long way; don&#x27;t want to weigh down your hair</li>
    <li> Great product.  Adds volume.  Makes hair a bit sticky but so does every other product.  Great for flat hair like mine.</li>
    <li> If you have fine hair then you need this product. It gives volume to your hair and keeps it from going flat...ALL DAY!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy in his mid 30&#x27;s so my hair is getting a little thin in the front. This stuff helps prop those last few diehard strands up. And for that I give 5 stars and all my thanks.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this &amp; I was pleased to find it so much cheaper on-line.  I have very fine hair &amp; it works quite well provided that one is careful using it.  Otherwise, it is true that it can make your hair feel dirty or sticky.  What I do is to sprinkle a very little bit onto my fingers &amp; then be certain to get it directly into the scalp.  I</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair on the top of my head and I wanted that extra volume and oomph on top. This powder is wonderful. It gives my hair texture and lets me play around with it on my head to get the volume I want. It comes out white, but once you rub it into your scalp it disappears, trust me, I have very dark hair. Love that I found this and that my flat hair doesn&#x27;t lay on my head anymore.</li>
    <li> This little bottle has an effective and long lasting LOT!  It will \\&quot;wake up\\&quot; oily or stringy hair when there is no time to shampoo.  Use a little or else you will have a sticky mess.  I like to sprinkle it into my brush and work it throughout the hair; flip head over and brush it through then shake your head from side to side and watch the volume come.  Use fingers to style and off you go!!  Great product, great price.  For a small bottle it will last a long time.  If hair is short, be careful, only a sprinkle is needed.  Have fun, look great until it&#x27;s time to shampoo again, washes out easily.  Would have liked to have directions on how to use.  I was lucky because I used it before (a long time ago) and it came with instructions.</li>
    <li> Seems to work. I didn&#x27;t previously check the size of the bottle, just went off the picture so I was shocked how itty bitty it was when I recieved it. Seems to work but I hate the feeling of hair spray in my hair and that&#x27;s exactly what this feels like. I guess the technology just isn&#x27;t there yet to use product without the unpleasant feeling of something in your hair. I wouldn&#x27;t refer to this feeling as &amp;#34;texture&amp;#34; as the product described.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, and does lightly add some volume but straight corn starch does the same thing for MUCH LESS!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product!! A little strange at first with the wet sticky salt looking product shaking into your hair. Love the end result!! I have thin straight hair and couldn&#x27;t normally get any volume if I teased my hair. This product is a miracle for thin limp hair. You feel the product in your hair, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I have volume finally!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  Totally does a wonderful job at adding volume and texture to fine, thin hair.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, holds fullness w/o being sticky or stiff.</li>
    <li> I have extremely fine and thin hair.  My daughter is a beautician and introduced me to this product.  I was totally amazed, a few shakes and I thought she added a partial wig.  I have never before had this much volume without using tons of product that are gooey and flaky.  This is the answer I have been looking for!</li>
    <li> My favorite, cant live without, best texture/teasing power out there.</li>
    <li> Does a great job building texture and volume.</li>
    <li> I really had my doubts when my niece told me that shaking powder in my hair was a good idea but this stuff is great.  Instant volume, body and shaping and it stays, no need for any other product.  I have a short haircut and like to have it look just a little spiky and tousled.  Shake this stuff in, rub my hair with my hands, pick out pieces I want to stand out a little and done!</li>
    <li> Ok, first of all, this product is basically powdered glue. It is sticky and makes my hair feel odd. My boyfriend even said, \\&quot;yuck, what is in your hair? it doesn&#x27;t feel good.\\&quot; It does add some volume, but just to the root, and it tends not to hold up to high humidity. I like it for when I do a big, backcombed pompadour, but it isn&#x27;t great for daily use.</li>
    <li> I just opened the box from Amazon so I&#x27;m not sure how well the product will work.  But I searched for \\&quot;dry shampoo\\&quot; and this is one of the products that came up.  I should have read more carefully, based on the picture I expected a spray bottle the size of a small hair spray.  It is about 3\\&quot; tall and 1\\&quot; in diameter and 1/2 an ounce in volume.  My fault so I won&#x27;t send it back...but I will read descriptions more carefully.</li>
    <li> I too am a hair product junkie and have wasted more money on miracle hair products than I care to admit! I have a short, layered haircut that is not really thin but is fine in texture. This Powder Play is just the bomb...and just a little dab will do ya! The texture of the product is like baby powder, and I just sprinkle it mostly around the crown at the roots. It does change the \\&quot;feel\\&quot; of my hair but for me in a good way. The volume it creates is just crazy! And it gives my hairstyle holding power for the whole day. I can see for longer, thicker hair that this product might not be as effective, but for medium to short styles, it really does add that \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; that most of us are looking for. Don&#x27;t let the size of the bottle make you feel you&#x27;re not getting enough bang for your buck because it doesn&#x27;t take that much product per use, and I now more often than not can leave the house on day 2 with just a little sprucing up instead of a full wash/style. Hope everyone has many happy hair days ahead!  :)</li>
    <li> I like Big Sexy Hair products but this one doesn&#x27;t work for me so well.  It lifts up roots a bit, but makes hair sticky and greasy looking. I have excellent results with Ojon dry shampoo-volume and clean looking hair when no time to wash.  This powder didn&#x27;t give me even half of Ojon volume.  This powder works better for me as a separator of hair chunks, but overall I will not repurchase and I don&#x27;t really need that.</li>
    <li> By far the best bofing powder i&#x27;ve tryed, it dosent even make my hair oily.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for about 3 weeks and it has yet to become one of those \\&quot;I can&#x27;t live without you\\&quot; products.  I have a modified angled bob and very thin and flat hair.This product makes my hair look greasy a few hours later and it just feels weird...maybe I haven&#x27;t learned the \\&quot;tricks of the trade\\&quot; with this product yet.  I have switched back to the root pump by the same maker.  I also reliously use their Spray and Play hairspray...5 stars for both of those products!</li>
    <li> This thing feels like you spent a day at the beach, but it won&#x27;t curl it like the Bumble &amp; Bumble Surf Spray (formally Beach Bum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sprinkle some in your hair, and you can easily finger comb it. I really like this product.</li>
    <li> I already have thick, non-silky hair, but this stuff is great for me too because it&#x27;s so weightless. While pomades and other products fall flat after a while, with this powder I can pretty much just push my hair back into place if it goes somewhere I don&#x27;t like. Plus, it feels cool (as in, both awesome and chilly!) when it hits your scalp.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really notice any added volume, just makes my hair a little sticky.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It gives terrific volume. Sprinkle just a tiny amount into hair roots and rub in and voila!</li>
    <li> My favorite product to add height to hair.</li>
    <li> I am a female rapidly losing my hair at 51 years old with no explanation.  I&#x27;ve felt much less confident as my hair was appearing flat all the time.  This stuff rocks! It&#x27;s the bomb!  A little dab will do ya.  I am so appreciative to find SOMETHING to help!</li>
    <li> A few sprinkles do it! I have fine, short hair that looks tired as soon as I walk away from the blow drier. But, with a couple sprinkles of Big Sexy Hair Powder, it&#x27;s full of push around volume that lasts. And the little bottle lasts as well. I went a year after it was recommended to me by a salon that sold it until I needed to buy another! It&#x27;s great on clean hair or day old hair, but I think applying it twice might cause tangles. No matter, I only need to apply once and I am good til the next shower!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even tell you how many products I have bought over the years and used once or twice, put them on the shelf and then eventually thrown away.    This stuff is the real deal....it makes me look like I have twice the hair that I really do....plus you can actually make it two days without washing if you want.     Absolutely GREAT!</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this stuff. I have another brand I prefer. I have thick black hair and this stuff makes my hair feel greasy and makes it look dull. It does have hold but I don&#x27;t like the greasy look that it gives and the amount of buildup it leaves in my hair.</li>
    <li> Well back when i bought this, it was closer to $15, Plus $4 shipping. I think thats pretty ridiculous for how little of an amount you get. I guess i assumed it would be bigger judging by the picture, i was wrong. But yea, it does nothing for my hair, which could be due to the fact that i have long thick hair. Save your money</li>
    <li> Where have you been all my life?! Love this product. Great texture and volume with this. Doesn&#x27;t leave much of a residue like other products. Can easily comb through and restyle/touch up as the day goes on. I use it everyday and my hair looks awesome! Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Impressive product. Definitely adds body, density and shape, and little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff.  I have extremely fine, silky hair that looks just terrible without help from LOTS of product.  Over the years I have tried almost every volumizing product on the market to no avail.  My hair dresser actually recommended this product after I asked her about the possibility of buying clip-in extensions for volume.  Needless to say, I have not yet purchased those extensions.  This product makes you hair big starting at the root and it lasts all day.  With other volumizing products, my hair is usually flat within an hour, but not with Powder Play.  As one reviewer mentioned, it does make your hair feel a little sticky at the root, but that really doesn&#x27;t bother me because it&#x27;s not like I have random people running their fingers through my hair.  I love the Marlo Thomas look but was never able to pull it off because my hair is so fine but this product actually keeps my hair in place and lets me have the cute 60&#x27;s look I love!  I have recommended it to several people... it definitely give hope to people with baby fine super straight hair!!!!  Oh, also, it even keeps your hair big in humidity.  For example, I went to a cookout and was outside all day today where it was a very muggy 92 degrees F.  When I got home, my hair looked exactly as it did before I left my house.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> For short spiky or styled hair, this crap is awesome. Loves it day in day out. Feels like playa dust in your hair so you may shape it and mold it into cuteness</li>
    <li> I tried Powder Play (after being talked into it by the girls at the supply house) for some extra volume. I was sooo happy, it was awesome, and at any time you can tossle  hair and BAM, volume is back! BUT WAIT!!!! You can NOT get this stuff to wash out of your hair. It left a horrible residue on my hair(after washing),and I had a wierd mixture of greasy texture at roots and dry straw at the ends. I tried clairifing shampoo, baking soda, and then finally luandry soap!!! We all know how hard that is on the hair, so I had to give my hair a kerastase treatment, and I still had a bit of residue on my hair. This was, at first, shocking and then I just got pissed at what I had to go through.If you care at all about your hair looking shiny or clean.....DO NOT buy this stufff!!!</li>
    <li> I have fine thin hair. When I didn&#x27;t have time to shampoo my hair, I would sprinkle talcum powder over it and comb it through.  It fluffed up my hair and made it look thicker but it clumped around the roots.  I wanted something more professional so I ordered this product and it&#x27;s the same as the talcum powder! It even clumps at the roots.  What a waste of money. Ladies, just take some of your bath powder and you&#x27;ll have the same thing as this bogus product.</li>
    <li> When you first put it on, it seems to give you volume, but then my hair goes back to its normal state.  Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong, not sure.</li>
    <li> Came in Quick, Very PLEASED with item(s)!!! Great Shape like brand new!!! Makes your hair big and fluffy in seconds!!</li>
    <li> Great product to add volume.</li>
    <li> Best thing to ever happen to wax. Better at texturizing.</li>
    <li> Works great!! I bought some for my mom and myself!! It gives you volume and it stays all day!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried anything like this before but I love this! It made my hair so soft. I used this and hairspray when I work working my hair and the powder made my hair light but with a lot of volume. It also soften the hairspray. Usually I get a little of that crunchy hair action with only hairspray. Instead, I had light volumized hair all night!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping. Good transaction. Love this product. You sprinkle a small amount in areas of your hair that you want to back comb or style and it holds all day, actually until you wash it out. Great product.</li>
    <li> Please check the size before ordering. For $11 I expected a larger bottle. This is about the size of a trial or travel sized product. It works ok. I notice a difference but nothing earth shattering. For the price it is definitely not worth it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a GOD SEND. Seriously. I have baby fine, thin hair and it&#x27;s astonishing how much volume this powder gives me. I usually hate every new hair product I try, too, but this stuff is the real deal. The only downside is how sticky feeling your hair becomes.</li>
    <li> I am sorry that I purchased this product.  It does volumize your hair however it is so drying to the hair and if your looking for a soft, wavy style this is not the product to use.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Struggled w fine hair forever. This really gives hair a lift.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for fine, thin hair to give it volume &amp; lift. Lasts all day. Also works to perk up 2nd day hair when you don&#x27;t have time to wash again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!! I love the BIG hair look so it works perfectly! add a little shine serum put my powder play on and a lil hairspray and thats it!!</li>
    <li> I would have returned it except that I did not try it until it was too late. It is a tiny little overpriced container of powder that you shake on. I have had better results with plain talcum powder; it is the worst dry hair treatment I have ever used. I feel cheated.</li>
    <li> I do not understand how it works but it does.  I have tried a lot of product on my hair with little success.  My hair is thin and will not stand up unless I use the stuff the makes you hair like glue.  This will lift you hair where you want it  I use some pomade after to give my hair some shine</li>
    <li> Made my hair pretty greasy and dirty-looking, and stripped the dye off my roots.  I generally like bigsexyhair products, but not this one - not for dyed hair!</li>
    <li> This little can of product is a whole lot of power in one little container. It&#x27;s awesome how my hair can be dead, and I will put this on the roots! Poof, when I curl it then, and fix it, it looks awesome!  If you haven&#x27;t tried this, get it and see how much fatter your hair is1 The shipping was also great and I so appreciate Amazon.com having all these wonderful products with such wonderful fast and free shipping!</li>
    <li> So I have thick, coarse, heavy hair, I always wanted to teaze my hair where it creates a volume bump on top, but as soon as I did that, pfffft, came right down fast, so a friend told me about this, it was hard to find it in my city, but when I did, I was happy, it does what I was hoping it would, my bump stays up, and I can tease it easy. So I think I like it.</li>
    <li> Pretty good at giving root lift.  I am a bit weird about putting anything powdery on my hair but it creates a good texture with a little powder rubbed between the hairs.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Gives me volume that I never have had before</li>
    <li> The got 2 be powder works better for me. I use it to tease my daughter&#x27;s hair for cheerleading.</li>
    <li> I loved the big and sexy powder play! It gives your hair so much textue and helps create volume. Although on thing i didn&#x27;t like about it, was that it made your head feel weird. Other than that I would recomend it forsure!</li>
    <li> This product is a nice change from old volumizing mousse and sprays, etc. which just don&#x27;t work for my hair.  That said, you need only a VERY LITTLE sprinkle of this stuff onto your root area (if you sprinkle into your hand and rub together, it literally disappears) so I tap a small amount right under my hair at the root - lift hair, tap bottle. Then shuffle your hair section to get the volume.  It will make your hair course/gritty feeling, you are probably better off not spraying hairspray before you use it because you might not need any/alot of spray after applying it.  Target has this for $15.99 but it&#x27;s the same size bottle on Amazon for $7 less!  Too bad I missed out on that deal.  It&#x27;s def. the only volumizing product I&#x27;ve ever used that actually worked, but the powder is kind of strange and if you don&#x27;t like the gritty feeling in your hair you might not like.  (I find if too much comes out when I tap the bottle, just shake it out of your hair with your hands).  Overall would def. recommend to someone not having luck with other volumizing products but takes getting used to the feeling and how to use it properly.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely magical!  I have very fine hair (one hairdresser referred to it as my spider web hair) and have a difficult time getting body and volume.  A friend gave me a sample of this and voile! volume and body for the first time without hours of curling and backcombing!  Mentioned it to my cousin and she was the one who told me it was \\&quot;magic powder\\&quot; and now neither of us would be without it!!  Great stuff for fine hair!</li>
    <li> It does work if used properly. You have to just sprinkle a very small amount into the area you want to volumize, and it&#x27;s sort of hard to control the amount that comes out. A bit of this with a little backcombing really pumps up the volume on my fine hair. It does feel kind of icky on the scalp, stiff and I would use extreme caution in breathing it in (hold your breath or cover your face with a mask when sprinkling), these tiny fibers could get in the lungs. With that caution its worth using for us thin hair folks.</li>
    <li> It really creates volume- but a little goes a long way. Just sprinkle sparingly along roots, and tease. If you use too much, it made my hair almost greasy, which is weird- since its a powder.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. I would recommend it to anyone with shorter hair. Makes your hair amazingly controllable &amp; I use it the day after I shampoo to refresh my style. My hairdresser introduced me to the product which was demonstrated at a hair show. I give this a definite thumbs up.</li>
    <li> This stuff is miraculous.  I have long, fine, limp hair and no amount of blow drying has made a difference.  This product instantly lifts the roots and makes a very noticeable difference.  However, it is not one and done.. I found that I needed to keep massaging the area to lift the hair again throughout the day, but its came back great every time.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. A tiny amount does wonders for shaping my hair. I love the small size for travel.</li>
    <li> I told my hair dresser that I needed her to teach me how to backcomb my hair and she told be that I didn&#x27;t need to backcomb my hair to get volume on top. That is when she showed me this product. And when she got done putting it in my hair I was amazed. With my fingers only, I could style volume into my hair...if that makes since. :)     Also I am a person who has to wash my hair every morning and the next morning when I woke up with the product still in my hair, my hair was not greasy looking and I was able to just comb and style my hair real quick and get out the door. Great stuff. Highly recommend it to people with fine/thin hair.</li>
    <li> Awesome, awesome, awesome!  Oh ya did I forget to mention awesome.  I have been looking for something for my straight, fine, sometimes limp hair to give it the \\&quot;fluff\\&quot; it needed on my roots...well this is is!  Awesome!</li>
    <li> This powder works great to give your hair volume and it keeps your hair looking great for hours. It takes a little practice when first used. You only need a small amount at the roots, I really like it and I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I always had WAY too much hair, but as it grayed, it became fine, limp and flat. I have used every volumizer I could find, bought what the hairdresser suggested, just tried everything mentioned. I found the Big Sexy Hair Root Pump Mousse and my hair started looking better. The last haircut, she recommended Power Play, and what a difference! The waves have returned! I use the BSH Root Pump on my wet hair, then when it is dry, I sprinkle a little of this at the root in the areas that flatten easiest, and wiggle my fingers through it. Nice product, and people have noticed!</li>
    <li> This will teach me to only buy these products in a salon where you are guaranteed the quality of the product. Instead of being the actual product it was a chalk-like almost baby powdery feel..it was horrible and got trashed after the first use.</li>
    <li> not really usefully, so sticky, makes you feel you are carrying tones of hair on your head...</li>
    <li> Holy Cow! I love this stuff! I can&#x27;t even tell you enough how much I love this stuff! I love that it comes out in just a little bitty sprinkle so you&#x27;re not getting too much, I love that it lasts forever, I love the volume it adds to my short hair style, and I love that it gives such texture to my hair that makes it easy and manageable to fix, just a couple sweeps and touches with the fingers and it&#x27;s perfect! I am using so much less product and hairspray now too. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use it to bodify my hair EVERY day. I have thick but fine hair and sprinkling a little of this stuff in it gives my hair major body! I can rub my fingers in my scalp throughout the day, and this product will fluff my hair up again. I call it my hair magic!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Good product at a nice price</li>
    <li> I have a pixie cut that tends to flatten out the next morning after washing the day before.  With this stuff, now my hair actually looks better the second day!  It poofs right up.  It makes my short, fine hair very piecey, which is the look I am going for.  I cannot believe there is a product that finally really does what it claims.  This is the holy grail for piecey pixie cuts.</li>
    <li> Product is easy to use and works great to give hair lift and volume.  Ordered product through Amazon - came to me quickly and in great new condition.</li>
    <li> I wasnt expecting a miniature bottle but I think itll last very long because you dont need a lot to get the volume you want (have thin and a lot of hair). But the smell is not so nice. Im using it only for bad hair days. Also not goid for dry hair I suspect.</li>
    <li> I hate this product. It didn&#x27;t make my hair look any fuller but it did make it an un-brushable and sticky mess at the roots. If you&#x27;re looking for greasy, sticky, and matted down roots then this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> Ive tried so many volumising products and this type of powder volumizer is absolutely the best Ive found - easy to use and lasts for ages - its really good value for money</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever tried a product like this. I bought it mostly to use on the days when I don&#x27;t wash my hair. Usually I wash my hair every other day, and on the days I don&#x27;t the roots are so oily they turn dark (I have medium brown hair) and it gets gross so I just tie it up in a ponytail. Yesterday I tried this product on freshly washed and blow dried hair, and the white power instantly disappeared and I just sort of fluffed it with my fingertips and there was definitely some lift. But the realy test was today when I didn&#x27;t wash my hair. I wore a showr cap, and then just blow dried the parts that got a little damp. I noticed that my roots did not seem that greasy at all from using the product yesterday. I couldn&#x27;t believe it, it almost looked like I washed it. I added just a bit more of the powder to make sure it didn&#x27;t oil up, and I&#x27;m really happy with it! My hair is down today! I highly recommend this product to anyone who has oily hair and doesn&#x27;t want to wash it every day. The bottle it comes in is so small that at first I thought they sent me a sample size by mistake! But you really don&#x27;t need a lot of the powder, so I think it will last a while!</li>
    <li> This does give you volume, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last long. The product feels really odd on your hands though</li>
    <li> This product is definitely not for people with thick long hair. I wanted to use this product for a little lift and ended up having to use half the bottle to even get a noticeable effect.</li>
    <li> This is a travel size and very tiny!!!!! Complete ripoff!!!!</li>
    <li> AWESOME product!  Highly recommend for thin fine hair….Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this volumizing powder based on all the glowing reviews on Amazon. I don&#x27;t normally write product reviews because I&#x27;d just be repeating what other reviewers have said. In this case, however, I would like to add that this product adds volume but...    It makes my hair very coarse to the touch, which I did not expect. I normally have soft and silky hair.    At the end of the day, I had to shampoo my hair five times in order to completely wash the product out.    I won&#x27;t be using it anymore and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> This really adds height to hair .  It adds texture and creates amazing hairstyles !</li>
    <li> daily hairwasher, skipped today to use this. hair feels like a really cheap wig. first off, made huge tangles in my almost shoulder length hair. once i got them out, brushed and combed on and off for almost an hour to give it a chance to work. stringy, course, stiff feeling. almost $10 for a three inch tall bottle of disappointment. most other reviewers love it like mad, but this sure does not work on my thin, fine, oily strawberry blond going gray hair.</li>
    <li> this hair powder is super. adds amazing volume and manageability to my ordinarily fine, limp hair. AND there is no noticeable aroma.</li>
    <li> So amazing! For those days you just need a little extra lift!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works great!,  It&#x27;s a small bottle but you don;t need a lot of it.  It says to put in your hands then distribute thru hair.  I just put on my hair.</li>
    <li> I am rather square headed and need lift at the crown to look my best.  This product gives your hair lift without much teasing, and it keeps my hair in place.  I love it and won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> Works as well as expensive salon powders</li>
    <li> I was impressed that this product works as described, since so many hair products do not.  Once hair is dry, adding a bit of this powder and runing through hair will add volume to the hair and &amp;#34;thicken&amp;#34; the look as well as provide initial hold for easier styling.  As it is a powder it also gives you the added bounus of having a &amp;#34;dry look&amp;#34; which (as a guy with fine hair) is difficult to come by (or was)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply, takes seconds.</li>
    <li> I bought three dry shampoos to try -- John Frieda Luxurious Volume Anytime Volume Refresher, Got2b Rockin&#x27; It Dry Shampoo, and this product (Sexy Hair Big Sexy Hair Powder Play Volumizing and Texturizing Powder).  I HATED this product and would give it zero stars if I could.  I found that it make my hair feel more dirty and disgusting -- and it and seemed moist when I applied it (that came as a big surprise).  Yes, I am not a hairdresser, just someone trying to get to a 5:45 am train in the morning.  I can recommend the other two products, and I especially like the Got2b Rockin&#x27; It Dry Shampoo -- a larger container and a fresh almost-citrus scent.  My hair looks great after using it -- just ordered 3 more cans!!</li>
    <li> Works great to give me the volume I need for my short hair!</li>
    <li> I have very thin brittle hair, very prone to damage. I&#x27;ve always struggled with my hair retaining volume after I blow it out with a round brush. I recently came across this product and was soo excited. I no longer have to resort to back combing which we all know is harsh on your hair. Just sprinkle and rub and you get instant lift and volume. Hubby loves how sexy it makes my hair look, very satisfied :)</li>
    <li> I will never go back to gel for lift and styling of my hair. This product is great! I have short and fine hair and not only does the volume and \\&quot;wisps of hair\\&quot; look better but it lasts ALL DAY LONG. My hair looks as good at 6:00pm than at 9:00am.  Only down side is that I can&#x27;t find it at the stores (my hairdresser used it on my the first time) so buy it here...great price.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!!  I have thin hair and Powder Play gives me volume I can&#x27;t believe, and it doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job. I have used a curling iron for years to achieve the same results - Good bye curling iron.  What a joy.</li>
    <li> Not only does this not give me noticeable volume, it leaves a weird texture in my hair.  My roots feel sticky when I put this on.  Not a fan.  There are much better products out there for volume.</li>
    <li> Big Sexy Hair Powder has seriously changed the way my hair looks at 5pm.  I do my hair at 6am every morning and by the end of the day it still has volume with out the weight.  I once shed a tear when I accidentally tipped the bottle over and a small amount of powder spilled out</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using powder play for over a year and it is fantastic! No matter if I&#x27;m rocking a fauxhawk or keeping it classy with the the parted hair,powder play is versatile and adds volume to any look.</li>
    <li> Works like dry shampoo. Gives texture to fine hair - makes it &#x27;hold&#x27; in braids and twists much easier.  Good product!</li>
    <li> This does plump up thin, limp hair and makes it easy to style and play with. The product delivers what it promises, the rest is up to you.</li>
    <li> I need that extra volume in my hair. It definatly helps...</li>
    <li> pretty good, powder puff by Kevin murphy is the BEST</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My hairdresser used this on me and I loved it.  Bought it for $17.50 from him.  Then found it on here for almost 1/2 price. Great for short hair, not sure about long hair.  Can&#x27;t use too much or it gets sticky feeling. Pour it on hair and not on hands and then hair.</li>
    <li> Small bottle, but good stuff. Doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything, and feels odd in your hair - but works as a texturizer and a dry shampoo in one. If you need a little lift, give it a try.</li>
    <li> This worked just as well as a brand I found in the drugstore.  I think all of these powders do the same thing.  You can probably save your money.</li>
    <li> Great deal on this product compared to buying at a salon.</li>
    <li> I first bought this at a salon and loved it!! ... found it on here for a lot better price and I bought 3....</li>
    <li> This product makes you feel like you&#x27;re stripping all the oils out of your hair, but if you have fine or limp hair it really works wonders!  I have bone straight Asian hair and it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that will give me the lift and body that I&#x27;m looking for.  It&#x27;s really amazing and I can&#x27;t go one day without it now. I LOVE this product!!!!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it  !!!</li>
    <li> This product really does add lift to a hairdo but it feels a little rough (dry) in my hair.</li>
    <li> I question the authenticity of this product. I was surprised by the fact that when I got the product and the bottle was for 100% more. Odd size, different logo than the salon product I bought. And it comes out faster than the salon product I got. It also has been breaking out my head. The smell is funny, not like the original product from the salon. If something seems too good to be true it probably is.  And the price for this product should have tipped me off</li>
    <li> Big &amp;#34;STICKY&amp;#34; hair, need I say more!</li>
    <li> I have thin, dark, short, oily prone hair. I wash my hair everyday and this was the first try at a dry shampoo. If your hair is already oily, it will only absorb INTO the oil and make it sticky so your hair will stand up. It definitely added volume, but did not help absorb oil. Plus I practically used half the bottle to get these volumous results. The product is surprisingly small, it will fit in the palm of your hand. When it was time to wash my hair was so stuck together. For the price it&#x27;s not worth a try if you have darker hair.</li>
    <li> I have super straight, thick, heavy hair.  A lot of styling aids like wax and balms weigh my hair down rather than supporting the syle. Powder Play keeps my volume without weighing it down.  It also keeps the shine in my hair.  Just lift hair at the crown where you want volume, sprinkle and let go of he hair.  Run your fingers through a little and top with a bit of spray if you want.  I have all-day volume, even in humid weather.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love using this to crest volume at the crown. I have very fine hair so this works great for adding texture.</li>
    <li> It took a little while for me to figure how to use this and how much to use to get the desired effect.  I have really short hair and like a messy or spiky look.  The spiky look is best achieved with hairspray.  And hairspray still works better in high humidity and wet weather.  But when I&#x27;m running around town on a nice day or just lazing around the house and don&#x27;t want to use hairspray, this stuff gives me a really nice, messy, full hair look.  My hair is super thin, and not much makes it look fuller except hairspray.  Once you figure out just how to use it, this product works really well.  Plus it lasts into the next day.  I can get up the next morning and use my fingers to fluff my hair out again without adding any additional product to it.  It does feel a little sticky, but this is not a problem for me at all. Hairspray is a lot stickier.  Besides, hairspray makes my scalp itch after awhile.  I never have that problem with the powder play.</li>
    <li> This product works great!  My hair usually lays flat on my head but it stands up nice without back combing when I use this product....a little bit goes a long way :)[[ASIN:B00390DN34 Sexy Hair Big Sexy Hair Powder Play Volumizing and Texturizing Powder, 0.53 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair from Hashimoto&#x27;s Thyroiditis.  It&#x27;s horrible.  Your hair is your crowning achievement - mine is just not there.  I am in the public eye and it&#x27;s a bit daunting trying to get up in front of people when your hair is just not cooperating that day.  I have used this several times now and am very impressed with it.  My hair feels fuller and thicker in the problem places.  It arrived on time and in good order.  I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking to get a little more lift to their hair.</li>
    <li> Yeah, I do not recommend this product for anyone. Just a tad bit left my hair greasy looking at the root. You are better off just using baby powder or corn starch or a spray dry shampoo. It&#x27;s a complete waste.</li>
    <li> i love love love this product! gives my hair just the right boost and can be activated during an entire night out. just a little scrunch of your hair and it&#x27;s working great!  the amazon cost beats any in-store i have seen</li>
    <li> Good product works amazing for texture and style. I use to backcomb.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before purchasing and saw that they were mixed, but decided to go ahead and try it. Whenever I use this product, I do get a little bit of volume, but not very much and it doesn&#x27;t last all day. It also doesn&#x27;t double as dry shampoo, as my hair just gets greasier throughout the day, especially since you have to rub this product in which increases the grease factor.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long, straight and not too thick or thin.</li>
    <li> Works great for some extra lift.  I use it only on the crown so hair not so flat on top.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Got2b texture powder that I can no longer find anywhere.  I thought this product would be better because of the brand, but I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Works great for shorter fine hair. I have dark hair and I don&#x27;t notice any residue. Bumps it up but does leave it quite textured and not soft. Only volume product I&#x27;ve ever used where it does what it says every time.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the best invention for hair I have ever owned. I have always had a hard time teasing my hair because it goes flat so quick this works great</li>
    <li> This product does what it says! I have fine, thinning hair and a little sprinkle of this powder makes my hair look instantly fuller and thicker. I have used other products that were so-so, this by far is the best!</li>
    <li> WOW!!!!NEVR HAD A PRODUCT THAT WORKS THIS WELL..I HAVE SHORT HAIR BUT WORKS ON ALL LENGTHS a++++[[ASIN:B005Y2D7DQ Big Sexy Hair Powder Play Volumizing &amp; Texturizing Powder (.53 oz.)]]</li>
    <li> This product is great. I have very fine thin hair this product makes it full and helps to hold its style.</li>
    <li> Using to get volume for my hair when in my Elsa costume! It works great! I sprinkle this in at my roots, tease and hairspray and I&#x27;ve got MAJOR volume.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Came a lot faster than it said it would!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products ever! Good for any hair style</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve taken a bit more of an interest in my appearance lately. I&#x27;ve been delving into some health and beauty stuff. Wanted a hair product that didn&#x27;t feel like I had product in my hair, thought this sounded like the ticket. I hate hairspray, heavy odors, stuff like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give one&#x27;s hair a nice &#x27;piecey&#x27; look with some added texture. Nothing radical though. Makes your hair feel slightly stiff or dusty but nothing drastic on that front either - didn&#x27;t bother me (didn&#x27;t have any dandruffy flakes either).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m slightly dissappointed. Maybe I&#x27;m just not using enough, maybe I expected more than I should of. But for the price, I think you could spend your money on better things... it&#x27;s a surprisingly small container, only a bit bigger than one of those energy drink shooters they sell in the checkout aisles at stores.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! It works kind of like hairspray, but without the stiff, sticky look. Great for backcombing hair, and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I call this Magic Sprinkles.  I have fine hair but a crapload of it, with some wave and curl.  Currently my hair is cut into a choppy, layered, not-quite-shoulder length style, but this worked just as well when I had long hair.  I cannot live without this product!  Beware, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! Best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. I style my hair, add the powder and it gives it fullness like I&#x27;ve never had before!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty cool product. I have very thin long hair and I hate wearing it straight. I sprinkled a little of this around the roots and it immediately changes the texture of your hair and holds all day. You can certainly feel it in there, but that&#x27;s what I would expect in a product to actually work. Very pleased with this purchase. And yes the bottle is very small, but you only need to sprinkle a very small amount into your hair.</li>
    <li> It does what its supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give lift and volume for sure! The only drawback is that your hair is not that touchable after applying. Leaves your hair very dried out and &amp;#34;straw / hay&amp;#34; feeling</li>
    <li> This powder is fantastic!! My hair has problems holding a tease, but this product has changed all of that! A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Sexy Hair Powder Play volumizing and texturing powder provides lift just like the more expensive OSIS.  They are both very good at making your crown hair stand up a little, rather than backcombing ..</li>
    <li> I have the type of hair that has volume right after blow-drying, but falls flat a short time after. I told this to my hair dresser and she showed me this product. At first I thought that she was only trying to sell me something and that it wouldn&#x27;t really work. Well, let me tell you, I was wrong. She put just a tiny sprinkle in at the crown of my head and worked her fingers though. I had instant volume and it also boosted the body of my hair! I was so excited! It is so easy to use, and a little bit goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This powder play is a great hold for root rising. I would recommend this to anyone! This is not the first bottle I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> Threw out as it made big mess of my hair, will work well  if this is what you are looking  for this productis not for me.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just say I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  It may have worked well for others, but it was useless for me.</li>
    <li> My first experience with this product was when my stylist used it to puff up my short hair and give it some nice volume.  It worked brilliantly.    It makes your hair full-looking, not greasy or unwashed.    One caution, though.  It is made of propylene glycol, which the CDC lists as a toxic substance.  It is a \\&quot;synthetic liquid substance that absorbs water\\&quot; and has ill effect on your skin, kidneys, nose and lungs.  Link here: [...]    Knowing this, I don&#x27;t think it would be a good idea to use this product in the future.  Use at your own risk.    Shipping caution: I ordered it from Spasourceonline, an Amazon-fulfilled retailer.  The amazon box I opened was full of white powder; the product was not well-wrapped and the top came unscrewed in transit.  So buyer beware.  Because of this, Amazon refunded my product price and shipping.  So yay Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this product!  It gives the extra boost at your roots for volume, and you can also add texture to your hair and keep those sometimes pesky bangs in place.  Just always remember a little goes a long way and you can use too much.  Try a little at first to see what you really need so your hair doesn&#x27;t get gunky.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product to give my hair some lift.  The powder does come out white, but when you work with it in your hair, the white color goes away. I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This did nothing for me at all--perhaps it is because I have long hair and it does not scrunch up as well as short hair would.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> Great way to give your hair more volume and the control of unwashed hair to freshly washed. Works in hot and humid weather.</li>
    <li> Item delivered quickly and as described.</li>
    <li> I am ok with powder as a dry shampoo, but would not recommend wearing dark clothes that day to anyone. My hair is blond and therefore it is fine, yet, in comparison with Dry Shampoo in a spray bottle, this product steps back.</li>
    <li> Somewhat useful product. Not what I expected and has a tendency to dull my hair.</li>
    <li> i love it&lt;br /&gt;And i will bey form you net time&lt;br /&gt;and i will see what do you have by visit your store&lt;br /&gt;sorry for late</li>
    <li> Works somewhat, however, it leaves my hair feeling yucky! I ordered two cans (cans are very small) in order to get free shipping. Now I wish that I had ordered only one. This was recommended to me by a friend. It does add some body, but leaves a film on the hair that builds up. I only recommend it as a last resort. There are better products out there.</li>
    <li> I have tried it several times.  I can&#x27;t get it to add any height or volume to my hair.  I gave it to my daughter to see if she liked it any better than I did.  She hasn&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
    <li> i mix this with oasis and my hair stays puffed for days. until i was it. i also back comb my hair with it too so it sticks all night. i love this stuff</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the overall affect of this powder. It provides lots of volume, and you barely need any!</li>
    <li> This stuff is very strange.  It feels wet when it goes on and I don&#x27;t like the way it makes my hair look or feel.  I have other hair powders that do a much better job.</li>
    <li> Tried it once and now I am a loyal user.  Gives my hair volume without added weight!  Love this product!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this after a stylist used it once, and I&#x27;m really amazed. I don&#x27;t do a lot with my hair -- I keep it short and I kinda tousle it, and this stuff just makes hair obedient. I can put it in and do whatever. I flattened it. I stuck it all straight up. Then I flattened it again. With my hands.     That said, it&#x27;s easy to use too much, and I think there&#x27;s a learning curve there. When the stylist did it, it was hardly noticeable. I can tell I used too much, and it does give it a weird texture if you do.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like that slick clean feeling your hair has after washing,  if you want a little help teasing and getting that volume  than this is the product for YOU!  It is a very small container, but it really lasts you. The powder comes out white and as soon as you touch it, feels wet then disapears dry into your hair giving some texture and oomph.  I did an Amy Winehouse beehive and I&#x27;m telling you I couldn&#x27;t have done it without this miracle powder.  Whether you want to attempt a beehive or just getting a little lift, this is a perfect match for you.</li>
    <li> It really works to my surprise.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use this on braids when I want to stretch them out and give them some bulk - my hair is very thin. My hair feels pretty gross afterwards so I only use this a day before I&#x27;m going to shower, but it works really nice giving my braids some heft.</li>
    <li> Just made my hair feel very thick with product...not my ideal feel of &amp;#34;thickness.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This works well! Kind of makes my hair tacky, but I guess that&#x27;s how these powders work. This product make my hair look clean and feel great.</li>
    <li> Okay, guys!!!  If you have mild to moderate thinning hair order this NOW!  I&#x27;m a 45 yr old guy with ash/sandy brown hair that&#x27;s thinning in the front.  If it weren&#x27;t for my having been on finasteride for years, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d look like a pink bowling ball.  To complicate matters, there are a lotta&#x27; redheads in my family, so my lighter brown hair and flushing really shows off my scalp in social situations, the sun, when I&#x27;m sweating at all...it just isn&#x27;t pretty.  Or...to clarify, not pretty to me (not trying to head-shame anyone here).  Anyway, I have a problem spot on one side of my head that seems a bit thinner than the rest (I keep my hair cut pretty short).  Purchased this product specifically to help diminish how much my (pink) scalp shows through.  Works like a charm.  Not sure what&#x27;s in this, but it behaves like a grainy, matte thickener.  Comes out in a powder.  Closest thing to a magic wand I&#x27;ve found so far.  Wish I could say I&#x27;m gorgeous now, but I can&#x27;t...but my confidence went up a notch and my anxiety over my hair diminished a bit.  Good product!</li>
    <li> I am on a restricted calorie diet, so I have been losing some hair (don&#x27;t worry, it will grow back).  So my hair is really, really thin and flat. This was delivered this morning, pre-shower time.  Used a little blow dry gel and round brush as usual to dry my hair. Then sprinkled a tiny amount on the top of my head, and did some finger fluffing. Instantly, my hair was about twice as high.  I love this stuff. My hair feels like I used a little texturing wax on it, but it looks great, and is not at all stiff like hair spray.  Have been out and about all day, and have done a couple of fluffs, and it is still great. I am going to be using this every day.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t say on the instructions but I saw YouTube video of how to use it and it works like magic if you tease your hair after sprinkling the powder. Just need a little bit.</li>
    <li> I like that it is not sticky on hair or hands.</li>
    <li> Nice product, it works good if you tease your hair with it. A little waxy but it does the job.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product.  Service and shipping were also great.  I have looked for a product like this for years and am thrilled to tell you how wonderful it is.  It truly gives your hair body and volume like you would not believe.  I love it.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this on me last time I was in and I just had to order it! I have short straight blonde hair that I usually have to use a paste or gel to give it some texture. I used this stuff and my hair has instant volume and texture! It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other dry volume powders which, aside from being much more expensive, tended to create buildup over time which of course causes dull locks.  This is easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t dull the hair or get sticky, has no detectable fragrance, and comes in a good-size and shape of bottle that&#x27;s easy to hold and work with.</li>
    <li> Great product, arrived quickly, leaves my flat limp hair looking full and voluminous, while holding the style, even after sleeping on it.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing! love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Now using it as much as my mascara! How did I live without this tool?!?</li>
    <li> This is the best for my fine, blond, short hair.  I can zusz it and fluff it.  Even if I don&#x27;t wash my hair one day (always every day), I can just brush and add a bit more and looks great! Love Love Love it.  Never had anything like it!</li>
    <li> It is one of my favorite hair products. Fantastic!</li>
    <li> I have fine naturally blonde hair. It is difficult to find a budget product that does not leave my hair looking greasy. This product provides lift without the greasiness. Yes, you hair feels like there is product in it, but that should be expected. The bottle is small but lasts a long time. If you have never used powder before then I suggest looking up video tutorials on how to use it. I will be regularly purchasing this item.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product.  It really does work.  Yes, it can make your hair sticky and it feels a bit weird.  However, it does what it is supposed to in adding volume and allowing you to mold your hair any way you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a question for anyone- Is this product damaging to your hair or could cause you to lose hair?  It seems like my hair is a bit worse for wear after I&#x27;ve used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying to research the individual ingredients.  However, any insight anyone could offer would be appreciated.</li>
    <li> It does work...if you can get it where you want it.  It&#x27;s a very fine powder that is difficult to manipulate and it left my hair feeling like straw.  It washed out easily.  Maybe I just need more experience working with it.....maybe I used too much and that&#x27;s why my hair felt like straw.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product before and have been extremely pleased. But this shipment is of TERRIBLE quality!  It makes my entire head itch and feel filthy even though I wash my hair daily.  I cannot wait to shampoo after each use.  I would return the product but the return period expired 2 months ago.  I ordered the product in advance to be sure I had it on had for when my previous bottle was depleted (just last week). So now this new one is money wasted!</li>
    <li> I have only used it a few times. I am sure the more I use it the better I will get at having a great hairdo.  My hair dresser is the one who first used it on me and that is what made me buy it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, works better than any thing else I have tried, and I have tried many products.  Less is more.</li>
    <li> Yuck!  This stuff is awful!  Immediately plasters your hair down....coats your scalp white...and made my head itch!  It might work for some folks, but it is unusable for me under any circumstances....so sorry I wasted the money.....</li>
    <li> this works amazing but i think they send me the sample size its so small but you only have to use a little so i think this little bottle will last</li>
    <li> Great powder to maximize fullness.</li>
    <li> Helps give volume to your hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this powder.  I use it daily.  I believe it should be sold in packs of two or more.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser used a similiar product and I LOVED IT! So I thought this would work the same but doesnt. I barely get any volume from this product and not sure why...with all the other reviews Im wondering if Im doing something wrong...not sure how thats possible but this product does nothing for me. :(</li>
    <li> 😍 I love this stuff! Make sure your hair is completely dry before applying powder. If you apply powder to damp hair it will be very sticky and not http://www.countscarclub.com/12.htmlwork. It&#x27;s nice to be able to tease your hair without creating damage and that&#x27;s with this powder allows you to do! I absolutely cannot live without this product!</li>
    <li> I think I prefer the spray dry shampoos over this product. It&#x27;s great powder and gives you great volume, but the powder is sprinkled on and it&#x27;s hard to get it even in the back of my hair where I can&#x27;t see as well.</li>
    <li> Best hair volume product on the market! I am going to stock up so I never run out EVER! I will panic if I run out.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME!!! I have used baby powder sprinkled in my hair to absorb the oil if I needed to run an errand and didn&#x27;t have time to wash it. (Stay -at- home mom :) ). But I hate having that smell on my head.  This stuff has no smell. And it lifts the roots like crazy!  I use it on clean hair too because it adds lift. Dry shampoos don&#x27;t work well on me. And the price on here is half of what it is a a drugstore.  A must have in your hair arsenal of products.</li>
    <li> might as well have been corn starch, didn&#x27;t work any differently than corn starch would and was 10 times more expensive.  cute little, tiny container though!  :-(</li>
    <li> Wanted to try this, so I bought a small bottle of this.&lt;br /&gt;Really am amazed at how great this works.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the business. Ever see those amazing and volumized braids on pinterest or blogs? If you want to copy those than buy this. I love doing different braids and hair styles and this stuff makes them look like I got my hair done at a salon. My Dutch braids have lots of volume and look super stylish. As a note, I do not use this product in place of dry shampoo. I would not use this product on a daily basis, I think it would make hair too dry and probably stiff. But as I said for special hairstyles, braids, updos it is AMAZING.</li>
    <li> This is good if you have put product in your hair for a few consecutive days without washing and it&#x27;s starting to get weighed down. The powder stands it back up, but I will say it gives your hair the worst, crunchy/tough texture ever if you try to run your fingers through it. That being said, it looks good, which is the point.</li>
    <li> Let me just say that I love this stuff. BUT, this is very comparable to the Got2b volumizing powder. This ones great and it does give me volume and that teased look. But honestly I would not be able to tell the different between this one and the Got 2b. The Got2b is cheaper, I&#x27;d try that one if I were you! This ones great. Just whichever brand you prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: it can make your hair look \\&quot;dirty\\&quot;</li>
    <li> excellent volumizing and texturizing. Good value for  money as well. This is better than some salon products</li>
    <li> Seriously this stuff is the best!  I was watching youtube on doing a &amp;#34;texas bump&amp;#34; and thank goodness for this stuff, it&#x27;s like magic!  I have been putting it on my hair now I LOVE IT!  It really gives it texture and lift.  I have thin straight hair and the lift I get is unbelievable!</li>
    <li> Really good for making hair look big for the days u cant wash them. Or if u have flat hair and dont know how to tease hair to get extra volume</li>
    <li> I am not finding this the best product for fine hair. I use very sparely, but unless I am going for a very tousled, &#x27;messy&#x27; look, it causes my hair to just get tangled and pull out if I try to brush or comb it through from roots.</li>
    <li> Coolest product ever! Great for however much volume you needs and doesn&#x27;t go flat. My hair hates to curl and so I have found if you sprinkle some in your hand and scrunch your hair the hold is amazing, bouncy, and flexible. REMEMBER, a little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> I love this volumizing powder--absolutely love it.  My mom and I each buy this stuff whenever we see it on sale and it is cheaper on Amazon than it is at other stores I&#x27;ve seen it at so I was very proud to find it here and be able to get what I wanted for cheaper.</li>
    <li> There were very mixed reviews on this product when I bought it, but I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.  My experience with it was that it left my hair flat and grimy.  I made sure not to use an excessive amount I used a little at a time.  But it didn&#x27;t matter.  Someone mentioned that they couldn&#x27;t wash it out.  I didn&#x27;t not experience that.  I found that it did wash out of my hair.  For the record, if you&#x27;re looking to compare hair types: I have colored hair, that fine and thin.</li>
    <li> I was Blessed with long straight (flat) hair. After I&#x27;m finished curling it, I sprinkle this on top (not TOO much, or it makes your hair feel dirty), then is squinch up my hair - mostly in the back for volume, sometimes flipping it over and running my fingers through it. Flip my head back over, spray with a good (but not STIFF Hairspray - it looks &amp;#34;phony&amp;#34; and hairs stick in clumps if the spray is like an &amp;#34;EXTRA HOLD&amp;#34;).  This will LAST all day at work 9-10 hrs. I come home, brush my hair out, curl is gone, so if you care, re-curl. if not, sprinkle a little more, fluff, spray and GO!!!</li>
    <li> this was like a little bottle of a miracle for me. I could not believe how it helped, poof my hair!! I have short thin hair.</li>
    <li> I knew it was little, but it was still funny to open the package and see it.  But you need only a very tiny amount of powder to help your hair.  If you find it sticky or need to wash your hair five times to get it out, then you&#x27;re using WAY too much.  I sprinkle a tiny bit into my palms and rub it through my scalp.  And Voila!  I look like I have hair!  I can&#x27;t believe what I&#x27;ve been doing to my hair (spiking glue throughout waist-length hair???), only to find this wonderful product.  My hair is soft and full and sexy and I don&#x27;t have to blow it out or curl it.  My hair is extremely straight, thin and very long.  I didn&#x27;t really expect this to do too much, but I&#x27;m so glad I found it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have fine, straight hair. This powder lessens the appearance of oil and adds volume. Once it is in, I can also fix my hair to add volume throughout the day by rubbing my scalp. It does feel a bit weird-- just remember that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> SUPERIOR HOLD IN HIGH HUMIDITY ALSO GREAT WHEN NO SOFT WATER.  WORKS WELL IN WINTER WITH SOFT&lt;br /&gt;WATER TOO.  ADD HEIGHT TO HAIR AND STYLING CAN BE DONE WITH YOUR FINGERS.  AMAZING</li>
    <li> This stuff is crazy, you pour it on and tap it to mix into your hair. At first it looks like everyone will see powder in your hair, but it gets absorbed quickly. The hair feels a little weird with this in it, but it has to get some grip in order to make your hair expand. It really does feel like it expands too. I use it for crown braids and things like that to give my hair a little more oomph so my braids don&#x27;t look small and wimpy. For a wedding, friends and I got our hair and makeup done professionally and they use this product too. It&#x27;s great. Search thebeautydepartment.com to see how best to use it.</li>
    <li> And this stuff really works! I went out to our local bar the other night and I first, teased my roots with a normal hair brush (looking into getting a teaser comb since my hair needs major volume) then I added this product into my hair, and my hair stayed voluminous all night. I would go into the bathroom a few times during the night and just kind of do a scratching motion at my roots and the hair comes alive again! I would defffffinitely recommend this product to people with fine hair, thick hair, really ANY hair because it just really hold in the volume!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the way hair felt after using product,  it left my hair feeling like  cotton candy!</li>
    <li> Perhaps I just haven&#x27;t mastered the art of hair-teasing, or maybe my hair is just too fine. This product came highly recommended but I am not DAZZLED by it. It works ok, nothing to shout from the rooftops about.</li>
    <li> Adds a lot of volume but makes the hair rather sticky and you really can&#x27;t brush or comb through your hair after using it. Almost like hair spray but that said I have thin hair and this helps a lot.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  I have short hair and using this product after blow drying my hair gives my hair volume that holds throughout the day.  On top of that - the price for this product through Amazon is fantastic compared to the Salons in my area.</li>
    <li> When I first purchased this item I was doubtful in the sense that I myself am not used to putting a cocain like supstense in my hair but now that I have used it for about three weeks now it is one of my &#x27;&#x27;everyday products&#x27;&#x27; highly reccomend!</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair and wax does not work well in my hair.  This is a powder and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy. LOVE THIS.</li>
    <li> Save yourself the time, money, and anticipation.  You might as well pour quick drying glue in your roots.  DO NOT try to comb thru it - you&#x27;ll painfully tear your hair out.</li>
    <li> The spray gave my hair a weird consistency and dried it out terribly.  I hated this product and gave it away.</li>
    <li> Really does add volume! BUT.. it gives my hair a really weird texture &amp; also made it very static-y. I will use it every now and then but not for every day.</li>
    <li> This product not only gave my hair texture, it also help shape my spiky bed-head hairstyle. It lasts all day too! Very nice :)</li>
    <li> Does not work like you stated.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Feels like my hair is thicker and it stays in the style for the day.  Great product, you just have to make sure you use a little all around your hair.</li>
    <li> Fast service with Prime.  Exactly was described!</li>
    <li> Love this volumizing powder.</li>
    <li> I got this to round off my cart when I had some other add-on items in there and wasn&#x27;t sure what else to get... totally on a whim. I&#x27;m EXTREMELY impressed with what it does to my hair. I have fine, long, curly hair that tends to go limp within a few hours of washing/styling. This stuff is like magic, i put some near the side part in my hair and fluff it up and my hair stays beautiful and voluminous all day. The only negative is that it has a bit of a scent that I really don&#x27;t like, but it dissipates after a while. I&#x27;m not particularly sensitive to smells and it does bug me a lot when I first apply it.</li>
    <li> Not for me. I&#x27;ve never used a dry shampoo before so I have nothing to compare it to. It makes my hair feel dirtier and a little gritty. This brand was recommended by my hair dresser. I like the feeling of my hair all clean and smooth and I guess that can&#x27;t be recreated with a powder. Oh well, back to my regular morning routine. I will say that if I was trying to create an updo this would probably help give a lot of texture.</li>
    <li> I use this daily and it helps give my thin hair a little boost.</li>
    <li> Messy powder, thought I was ordering a spray. Huge mistake. Does the job but very hard to sprinkle the right amount out of the container. Skip this product, buy a spray.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a really good product judging from the reviews (except for one). I started with a VERY small amount sprinkled just into the roots at the front and top. It is very strange stuff. Upon contact it sort of melted into this super glue-like mass at the roots that it was impossible to get a comb through or even a pick. The next morning I shampooed twice to get it out. It is a bit scary. It went in the trash.</li>
    <li> This stuff works, just a little bit though, or it can get hard to comb. My hair is thinning and it helps it look thicker.</li>
    <li> I heard this was an amzing product, but it&#x27;s certainly not for everyone.  This made my hair gummy, greasy looking and flat as a pancake.</li>
    <li> The powder had liquid in it! Made my hair feel gross. I have used this product before and it never made my hair feel like that. Definitely won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I have very fine hair this gives amazing texture</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and have been looking for a thickening product. At first, I didn&#x27;t like this but then a friend showed me that I was using it wrong. oops! I wash and dry my hair (it works on dirty hair too). I lift up sections of hair and sprinkle this powder near the roots,  then tease the hair a little bit. It gives great volume and makes a huge difference in how my hair looks.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  This is the best stuff to use for volume and if your hair feels like it is to soft and won&#x27;t hold.  I have tried several brands and I really like this brand the best.  This price is much cheaper than I have seen before so it is even more worth it.  It is also a larger bottle than other companies.  I would recommend this to anyone.  I would also note that it doesn&#x27;t matter what kind of hair you have because even if you are oily it still helps give volume without adding to the oil.  A few other things to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;- a little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;- works no matter the color of hair&lt;br /&gt;- just slightly tap the bottle at a slant not upside down or you will end of having to wash your hair again because it comes out fast</li>
    <li> It provides great lift for the hair.  It is a little hard to shampoo out it makes you hair feel sticky.</li>
    <li> teasing made terrific</li>
    <li> This does add a small amount of very real looking volume. It&#x27;s easy to apply and blends in easily and quickly, however it does give your hair kind of a funky texture. I&#x27;m sure this is what makes it work, but it&#x27;s more on the dry chalky feeling side. Smells good too!</li>
    <li> This product is a little strange. It gives you volume, but makes your hair extremely dirty feeling. I would use this more for up do&#x27;s because there is no running your fingers through your hair. A little goes A LONG WAY! For me, it&#x27;s very difficult to wash out as well.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste ur money.  Seriously.  Y does this have so many positive reviews.  Hair spray feeling but less hold or pickup</li>
    <li> I have straight, fine hair.  This adds volume and helps with updos staying in place.  It makes your hair a little difficult to brush out but that&#x27;s why your hair stays in place.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this didn&#x27;t give it volume at all. After applying the powder it made my hair into a sticky tangled mess.</li>
    <li> Love it but leaves hair a little sticky so I have to wash it the next day.</li>
    <li> My hair tends to go flat very easy.  I love putting this in and teasing the hair a bit and the volume lasts all day!  I will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting the world but my $4 Tressemme dry shampoo brings more lift to my hair than this. I read that some women use this to absorb oiliness but this did almost nothing for my thin hair. Its OK, but I&#x27;ll probably end up giving it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try this - dry powder used with dried hair. But the increased volume of my hair is terrific. And, as long as I don&#x27;t put on too much, I don&#x27;t find the powder to be a bother. My hair also still looks good after a night of sleeping on it. Great for me, as someone who likes quick and easy hairstyling.</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly hair. For anyone who has a lot of hair, they know the heavier on bottom, the more the top pulls and falls flat no matter how much diffusing or &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; anything you buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been a life saver. I even have it in the travel size to keep in my evening bag when I go out. Put a little powder in your hand, flip your head, muss up your roots and continue to fluff throughout the day and HEY you have that magical unicorn thing called VOLUME.</li>
    <li> This was such a waste of money.  It does absolutely nothing to or for my hair never buying it again</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. Don&#x27;t know what I ever did without it! And it was cheaper to order it on line!</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY...THIS IS FAKE !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased and used Powder Play several times and love it. I was excited to see it on Amazon for such a great price so I ordered it. When I first used the product I received in the mail,  I noticed the texture was different and the SMELL was absolutely horrible! I had an empty bottle from my previous purchase from ULTA and upon comparison noticed several differences. Should have known that if something seems to good to be true, it probably is. The real product is great and worth the money in my opinion; however, this stuff doesn&#x27;t come close. Will not order again!</li>
    <li> This is the most disgusting stuff I have ever put in my hair. It made it feel wet and greasy. I don&#x27;t know who would ever want to use this, I wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It is my favorite! It also came in great timing!</li>
    <li> This makes fixing short, spiky hair easy and less time consuming.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product everyday for the last nine weeks.  Hard to tell, but it seems that I have used only half of the product. It lasts a long time.  I use it with the same brand hairspray.  WOW.  This product will be on my shelf as long as it is available because it has made such a difference in my thin, flat hair.  I actually get compliments on my hair now.  That rarely happened before I started using this product.  I still have to flip my hair and tousle it during the day, but after a little tousle, it still looks nice.  I used to have to wash my hair every single day, but now, I skip days.  When I skip a washing,  I sometimes have to wet the area at the top of my head where I have a cowlick, quickly blow it dry, add a little powder and spray.....and I&#x27;m ready to go.  This might not sound like much to most people with normal hair, but it is a BIG DEAL for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Powder Spray.</li>
    <li> Work&#x27;s great! I thought the bottle would be a little bigger but don&#x27;t let that deceive you! You don&#x27;t need much and it work&#x27;s all day. Will be buying again for sure!</li>
    <li> Way cheaper online than in the salons and this tiny bottle really lasts. I love the way it makes my hair look</li>
    <li> Wow, this definitely put a lot of texture with the tiniest shake of the bottle in my hair. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 starts because I think the directions could be more detailed with way to use it. Like should you tease, flip your head upside down and brush? I think the bottle could offer more ideas.&lt;br /&gt;One other thing I wanted to mention was that I have very dark brown hair and the powder is white and once it absorbs into my hair I don&#x27;t see any of it and it doesn&#x27;t give my hair a grey sheen like some powders do. I can feel it though so I know it&#x27;s stays in once it absorbs.</li>
    <li> When you put this powder into your hair, you get instant body, even without teasing! This long lasting, textured powder is perfect for a cute look when you&#x27;re in a hurry, or a big rockstar styled &#x27;do when you&#x27;re feeling courageous. Love this product!</li>
    <li> works great, even as a dry shampoo</li>
    <li> No doubt this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;And admittedly, I have thick hair that has pretty good natural volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does the job, but i have found that dry shampoo is cheaper and gives me the same volume and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; look when i haven&#x27;t washed my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder is really nice, because if you have highlights and are getting a bit of roots showing, this powder covers it up - both because it lightens the roots a bit, and gives you the volume that bleach gives you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, however, powder forms of dry shampoo (a little harder to find than the spray kind but totally available on amazon) is cheaper and does the same thing for me.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this stuff! I have very fine, wavy hair that even ratting and spraying won&#x27;t keep it up and fluffy looking all day long. This stuff WILL! Sprinkle very lightly onto the roots, fluff it around a bit with your fingers and voila&#x27; - hair that works!If you rat just a bit &amp; spray with BigSexy Hairspray you&#x27;ll have height and texture all day long and sometimes through the next day, too. Never sticky or flaky, just some texture. Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> Takes some getting used to to use. But works to add nice texture and volume! It seems like a small amount of powers in the bottle but a little goes a pretty long way.</li>
    <li> A friend who has short hair raved about this product, and I also saw for myself just what it did for her thin hair.  I have rather long hair and was sure it wouldn&#x27;t work for me.  Well I was wrong folks......this is a great product for those of us who work with thin hair and scalp that likes to show its ugly face.  Guess you can tell that I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used in my hair. It gives body and I can fix my hair much easier.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It makes it super easy to put a lift in your hair!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair too sticky and dirty! Lovebthe initial volume, but it only looks good for about an hour or so!</li>
    <li> Cannot believe how great this product is.  I have very fine, limp hair (no body), and my hairdresser used this on my hair after she cut it, and I am awed with the volume my hair now has.</li>
    <li> wow this stuff after applied on your hair becomes almost dewy like.  Yuck.</li>
    <li> Fast to arrive but did not work well for my hair. I find it weighs my hair down even with a tiny but being used. I could see that if I had short hair it may work better since there would be less weight.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way with this product. It adds just the right amount of volume to my roots. Great finishing product to have in your beauty arsenal.</li>
    <li> If you have never use this product, you need to purchase it immediately. It keeps your hair volumize all day. All you need to do is ruffle it up a bit when it starts to fall. I am so obsessed with this product and so happy that Amazon had it for so cheap.</li>
    <li> This is like a magic powder. The bottle is really small however. It really helps make a &amp;#34;puff&amp;#34; but I don&#x27;t like that it makes my hair stiff and somewhat sticky.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  It&#x27;s a game changer for my short, fine hair.  I only need to use a very small amount and the body and texture last all day.  Will definitely purchase again and well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Works as well as the more expensive kind.  I&#x27;ll get this kind from now on.  Really helps thin hair be &#x27;thicker&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Instant volume! And the white powder disappears as soon as you muss up the hair. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My hair acts like I just rubbed my head with a balloon.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle product. I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> This made my hair greasy/waxy feeling and really unmanageable.  It also weighed my hair down an it looked thinner than ever.  It left more of my scalp visible than hair.  So disappointing, because this is my favorite brand of hair care products and I expected better.</li>
    <li> It works to give enough stiffness to fine hair to be able to tease it.  But if you use too much, you get cotton candy.  It makes the hair very difficult to comb out, but when you have fine hair, you&#x27;re willing to overlook that.</li>
    <li> You can do the same thing with regular baby powder. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for adding thickness to the roots of my hair. Great for freshening up throughout the day.</li>
    <li> It works! I have been trying all kinds of things to add volume to my extremely FLAT hair. This stuff is great. You barely use any of the powder and it lifts your roots. I recommend this to anyone with boring, flat hair.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair great volume. I do notice though that it is a little harder to get out of my hair than other products. If I&#x27;m not careful to make sure that I scrub really well the places that I put this in my hair it seems like it starts to get a build up.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, but it takes some getting used to. The first time I used it, my roots were definitely lifted but the texture was odd. It&#x27;s great if you need some lift and you don&#x27;t want your hair to move around much. But if you&#x27;re like me and tend to run your hands through your hair often when it&#x27;s down, it can get stuck in weird ways, if that makes sense.</li>
    <li> watching the reviews on youtube i thought that this product would make a huge difference in volume but it was only ok.  I do like the product because i can feel and see the difference when i put it on.  Shipping was on time but the local post office F**** up and lost the item as usual and took 2 weeks to get to me.  The seller was very understanding and sent out another item as soon as i notified them that the post office had lost the package.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the way it made my hair feel.  Made my hair very tacky and dull looking.  Would not recommend this</li>
    <li> This is such a cool product.  It&#x27;s a very light powder that does surprising things.  My hair is a short, messy cut - blonde and fine.  With just a little of this product sprinkled at my roots, I can twist and turn my hair exactly how I want it.  It gives it great volume and really lets the texture show.  Don&#x27;t use too much - it can feel chalky.  However, if you have oily hair, this will help you get another day out of your do!</li>
    <li> Use daily.  My hair is thin fine and has cowlicks. This is wonderful for all three. Helps hide the gaps.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used it once and I received many compliments.  I have thin hair and this volumizing texturizing powder gave it fullness.  It has a cool feeling and a nice look.</li>
    <li> really makes a difference in your hair. I have used it 3 times already I curl my hair put some on makes a big difference.</li>
    <li> I have very thin, fine hair. From the reviews, I thought this might be my miracle potion. I have to admit, I don&#x27;t like stiff sticky hair products. This is like sprinkling powdered glue onto your hair. I couldn&#x27;t wait to shampoo it out.  I&#x27;ve never felt anything like it.  If you are a heavy hairspray user, this might work for you.  I&#x27;ll stick with my faithful favorite between shampoos...baby powder.</li>
    <li> I have fine, normal,  healthy hair.  All I wanted was some volume.  It made it hard as a rock and greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Got2b Powder&#x27;ful is much better in terms of volume and staying power.  They are the same product, but I decided to try Big Sexy Hair because the container comes with a little bit more powder and I liked the packaging a bit better.  Got2B definitely gets the job done more efficiently and I think it&#x27;s actually a bit cheaper. This one is just OK.</li>
    <li> I purchased three of these and they do not seem to be the real product.</li>
    <li> Love it for volume ...</li>
    <li> THIS DID NOT WORK FOR ME</li>
    <li> Sorry, but this stuff just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I put it in my hair, rubbed it in and.... nothing.  I tried a lot, I tried a little, I tried everything to make this work but it had zero effect on my hair.</li>
    <li> works okay but i may be trying out a different brand for my next volumizing dust. I typically love all bigsexyhair products, though.</li>
    <li> I had heard a lot of good things about this product.  Although I have a lot of hair, it is rather thin so I often need a volume boost.  Since I frequently use dry shampoo spray to uplift my roots, I wanted to compare this powder.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to fluff up my hair as much as the dry shampoo.  It also feels heavier and seems weighs my hair down.  It&#x27;s almost counterproductive.  It also feels slighty &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;.  Since I&#x27;ve read so many good reviews, I guess I&#x27;ll continue to try it and see if I get any different results.</li>
    <li> I thought it just made my hair tacky. Like if you put waaaay too much mousse in.  Prestige hairspray is much better for volume, given you back comb it.</li>
    <li> This gives good &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; to fine textured hair.</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine hair and color it routinely.  Because of that I can&#x27;t perm, my hair will burn, add in the southern heat and humidity, getting volume and body is next to impossible.  This volumizing powder is a miracle worker for me.  I dont even have to use it everyday, it&#x27;ll last till my next hair washing, which on average is every other day, or two.  Much better priced than buying in a salon or department store.  Savings about $7.00.</li>
    <li> This product sticks together and makes your hair stick together too.  Hair feels dirty.  Would not buy again!</li>
    <li> The ONLY thing I need to volumize my thin volume less hair. The best powder out there.</li>
    <li> First, be aware that this bottle is TINY. I was picturing a normal-sized product bottle, but for one Alexander Hamilton you are buying a trial-size bottle. Second, for me at least (normal to fine hair, shoulder-length, slight wave, wash every other day), this does not work any better than the Suave brand dry shampoo that costs three bucks for six ounces. That&#x27;s more than 40 times the price. Wow. Works OK, not great.</li>
    <li> I do not know what sexy effect it creates ??? I do not see the effect on my hair. Disapointing</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product I have ever used.  I have fine, thinning hair and this boosts and holds volume all day.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. You have instant volume and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy at all. I love that I can wake up the next morning, brush my hair and I&#x27;m ready to go! I used to have to wash it every day, which made it limp. But with this product I have so much volume! And you choose how much volume you want. Just fluff it up throughout the day and  you are good to go!!! LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I agree with the other 5 star reviews.  I used to use hair spray to back tease my hair on the top.  This works so much better!  Holds and lifts my shoulder length fine but thick hair, and makes your hair feel like it has texture.  Use only tiny taps or your hair will feel gummy. It is a little tough to see where it has landed on the hair when you use so little, but if you have a dark wall or background behind you while styling, it helps.  This lasts and can be finger fluffed any time during the day.  Wonderful!</li>
    <li> it worked on me well to add some volume but the bottle is so small for the money that u could prolly only use like 3 times i wish they made them in bigger bottles...but the product itself worked great i just sprinkled some on my roots and instantly got oomph!!so maybe if u dont plan to use all the time this is for u!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after the glowing reviews because I have fine thin short hair, and need all the help I can get.  I just about have to back comb daily to give any lift or volume and have been looking for that miracle product for a long time.  I have tried just about everything and then suddenly ran across this product.  Sounded too good to pass up.  The cost of the item and shipping was outrageous.  The powder is more like baby powder and feels damp when I put a little on my palm.  Strange stuff, but it  doesn&#x27;t work like my Osis does.  I also purchase Osis on Amazon and it has rave reviews.  I guess it all depends on your hair.  Sorry I spent the money on this, but for those people for whom it works, no money is too much when you have a good hair day.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and this is the best product I have ever used to have volume in my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times now with the same results...nada!  My hair is the same with or without it.  This was the first time I&#x27;ve tried this brand.  I like their hairspray, so I thought I&#x27;d try it.  I&#x27;ll go back to my other brand...it actually works!</li>
    <li> Finally a hair product that works!  If I had all the money I have wasted on other hair products with all their promises that forever fail to deliver, I would be rich.  Saw this product and like any hair product junkie had to have it, even while I was telling myself I was just wasting more money on another product that would not deliver.  WOW was I wrong.  I have super fine hair that likes to lay flat with no body at all - well not anymore.  Sprinkled a little of this powder on, and I mean a little, and viola! - great body - great hold - and my hair is so much easier to style.  Wish I had found this sooner.</li>
    <li> I have very flat, fine blonde hair and this product has completely changed my life.    Before powder play i would usually just wear my hair up in some sort of pony tail/bun combo with no bangs in the face. My hair is so fine that by noon it looks greasy if any hair is in my face. Tying my hair up was the only option that seemed half way presentable.    After I was introduced to powder play I can bump my hair a bit for some volume, or just sprinkle a little on the roots for some volume when my hair is down. its a GREAT product and I would highly recommend for that purpose!    however, the stuff is NOT meant to sprinkle over your entire hair. it WILL make it sticky and heavy, but for some reason just a little bit of this stuff lifts the roots so well, without making hair greasy!</li>
    <li> I love this, it really adds a huge amount of volume to my fine, thin hair. It&#x27;s actually kind of crazy how much volume it adds, I&#x27;ve tried a million products and none have worked as well as this. I am knocking a star because this is really hard to use; you have to tilt the bottle to sprinkle the powder and for me it is impossible to see and tell if anything has come out, especially in the back of your hair. I&#x27;ve tried sprinkling it in my hand first but it seems to clump up with the oils on skin before you can even get your hand to your scalp. It doesn&#x27;t seem like it matters if you accidentally overdo it because because it isn&#x27;t visible on the hair, but I feel like I waste a lot of it trying to guess at whether or not any powder is actually coming out.</li>
    <li> My hair is flat, forevermore. I will say that compared to other volumizing powders I&#x27;ve used, this texture is the best so far.</li>
    <li> This was pretty expensive in my opinion and I did not see accurate results from it. I tried with additional products but my hair always fell flat. Maybe I was not using it correctly but I followed the directions on the bottle so I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received this product today was so excited to use it and when I opened up the package the bottle had a hole in it and has spilled all over the entire package. Was super bummed that I am not able to use it. Contacted the seller and Amazon regarding this, but haven&#x27;t heard back. Buyer be ware!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Use it daily! I have super fine hair-think like baby hair, and it works great with my teasing brush to give me some volume.</li>
    <li> I was in a hurry and thought I was ordering dry shampoo, which is what I searched. I was reluctant to use this when it came, but I was totally desperate one morning and sprinkled it on. Wow!  Volume with no visible residue. No unpleasant odor. I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
    <li> After reading so many wonderful reviews on this product, I ordered it right away!  I must say though,it didn&#x27;t do much for me.  It didn&#x27;t give me the volume that I had hoped it would.  Plus I didn&#x27;t like the very sticky feel to it. Therefore, only 2 stars.</li>
    <li> I have always been frustrated with my hair weighing down around the crown, even if I could get some body into it in the morning, guaranteed it was flat by mid-day.  This stuff is amazing!  I just sprinkle a tiny bit around my roots/crown and it lasts all day and into the next.  It&#x27;s like a dry magic gel!  Love this stuff and my \\&quot;new\\&quot; hair style capabilities.  The container is super tiny (think height of a cell phone) but a little goes a LONG way.  It makes skipping washing hair that much easier for those of us with non-volumized hair/roots.</li>
    <li> This product really works for my hair. It allows me to back comb some volume to the top of my head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this powder for a couple of weeks and I&#x27;m amazed at how great it is. Pretty unique, too. It&#x27;s an ultra-fine powder that&#x27;s unscented and feels cool on my scalp upon application. The holes in the bottle top make it easy to sprinkle on just enough. The powder blends into my brunette hair evenly and immediately -- so I never look like I&#x27;m wearing a powdered wig (always a plus). Doesn&#x27;t make my hair look dull or like it&#x27;s collecting dust, as other powders tend to do. Many other volumizing / texturizing products are either pomades or sprays that can be sticky or greasy or both. I have none of those problems with this product. And the best part is that this powder instantly triples the thickness and texture of each hair strand. I can do virtually anything with my choppy bobbed hair once I add this powder. The bottle is tiny but a little goes a very long way -- and the small bottle makes it convenient for travel. Highly recommend this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so confused with this product because it got so many great reviews. I have medium to fine hair and I&#x27;m obsessed with columizing. My teasing comb is my best friend, but I don&#x27;t over volumize my hair into afro style. I was super excited for this product because sometimes, teasing can get annoying and I wanted a little helper in bringing a natural lift in my hair. For some reason, this product does absolutely nothing to my hair. I experimented with applying a little bit to a lot, and all those times, it was not effective at all. The most that it did was make the roots of my hair a litttle sticky, but still, not noticeable volume was added.&lt;br /&gt;I consider myself to be very good at handling hair and hair product, which was why I was very upset and discouraged that this product was not working for me. I wish I could return it because I really feel like I wasted my money. Powdered dry shampoo honestly does a lot more for me.</li>
    <li> This product does wsaht it is supposed to, gives me great volume I love it!! However if you have dark hair (I have black hair) becareful not to use too much, gives my hair a grey tint when I use too much.</li>
    <li> I really like how I can quickly get my hair up in volume with this. Use just a tiny amount and don&#x27;t expect it to last more than a day-it makes your hair get a greasy feeling after (and only use it on  roots) I have medium long fine hair. It will hold a curl but it can flatten out fast, I also am an athlete and all the workouts get my scalp sweaty and I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday. This extends the life look of my hair and also can make going out at night hair styles happen more quickly than just starting from scratch.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once but it worked well for my thin hair! shipment came ontime.  satisfied with the product so far.</li>
    <li> It works ok, but it has that &amp;#34;dry wheat&amp;#34; feel to your hair afterwards.  I didn&#x27;t use too much of it either.</li>
    <li> This powder works awesome!!! Only downfall is that wherever you put it you can&#x27;t run your fingers through. As for volume, it works great!</li>
    <li> Absolutely crucial for those who want the messy look and not deal with any hair gel. This product last all day and does leave hair oily.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Got one for my sister too.  It&#x27;s stupid that my review has to have a certain number of words.  I shouldn&#x27;t leave one for the principle of it.</li>
    <li> I use this product to puff up the spikey parts of my hair, and this works without hairspray or a &#x27;crusty&#x27; feel to the hair.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This stuff is nasty - makes your hair look dirty and feel sticky; a complete waste of money. My hair is very long and the powder is going to create snarls. Back combing makes my already big hair look even bigger and is free. I used this product once and couldn&#x27;t wait to get it  washed out of my hair.</li>
    <li> Works great at giving me lift at my roots!</li>
    <li> it is ok  but not as good as the other one.</li>
    <li> really helps fill out the crown of my head and adds the fullness I need without teasing.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair. This product is great if you are in between color appointments or if you want more texture in the roots to put your hair up. Love it! Great product!</li>
    <li> This left my hair feeling like it had greasy wax in it, though it did make it look better. However, I ended up putting my hair up in a pony tail anyways because I couldn&#x27;t stop touching the spot. The greasy feel bugs me more than the look of my hair</li>
    <li> She&#x27;s running all over looking for it in the stores and cannot find it anywhere. I can&#x27; t either, she loves it, swears by it.</li>
    <li> great service. awesome product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! its like a tacky miracle hair powder! I can put this on a loose plaited braid and it won&#x27;t go anywhere. This stuff adds amazing texture and staying power.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!  It&#x27;s great for adding volume to fine hair.</li>
    <li> It has a weird texture in your hair. It does give it volume but if you go to touch your hair later it just feels funny. I like it, but I don&#x27;t use it very often.</li>
    <li> Works good but my hair is fine and a little thin so a dab too much and it looks caked together or greasy</li>
    <li> Due to PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome), my hair has been thinning for years.  Now, it&#x27;s not really at a point where other people might notice, but I do, and this stuff really makes it much thicker and gives me more confidence.  I just sprinkle a little here and there and fluff it.  My ponytail becomes instantly thicker and I can poof up the top and sides to give myself more volume.  The one downside is that your hair won&#x27;t be as shiny (I mean, it&#x27;s like putting baby powder in your hair after all), but it does really thicken it.  Also, I thought maybe the powder would be evident, since it&#x27;s white, but once you rub it in it disappears!</li>
    <li> YES. this is the product. My hairdresser says I have healthy hair, but to me it seems thin and limp. Due to stress it&#x27;s been falling out for months. I recently got a very horrible haircut, and had to go for a second cut, which ended up much shorter and sassier. My hair now has some texture, and is pretty short in the back with some cute length in the front.&lt;br /&gt;A million years ago I used Aveda control granules when I had a similar cut, but I don&#x27;t want to pay $25 for it.&lt;br /&gt;What I do with this product is NOT shake it directly onto my hair. I read that is someone elses review. If you shake it directly onto your hair, it&#x27;s a clumpy sticky chunk. So I shake a tiny bit in my palm, smack my palms together, and rub them through parts of my hair, with my head upside down. Repeat until desired body. Then I hit certain spots with my head upright, until everything is plumped but not crazy looking. I can shake my head and the hair moves, and I can scrunch it a little throughout the day when it&#x27;s getting limp. I didn&#x27;t see this particular product in any of the local drugstores, so hopefully amazon will carry it for a while.</li>
    <li> I like big sexy hair products in general. This item is hard to use. It has an almost wet feel to it. This powder made my hair sticky and greasy looking. I had high hopes for this item.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair and most other styling products tend to weigh my hair down or make it look greasy. I purchased this to give it a try, and it works fairly well. I dab a bit on my fingers, ruffle my hair and that&#x27;s it! It gives me awesome volume and a feathery/piece-y texture that I usually cannot obtain with other volumizing products. The powder feels a little unpleasant on my hands, but it washes right off. I highly recommend this to anyone with fine hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is curly but fine, and flat on top so it literally sticks to my scalp. My hair dresser used this on me last week and I LOVE it. Just dust a little underneath your top layer and rub your fingers on your scalp and you will have a good amount of lift and volume, without it looking hard or being sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the sprays, gels, mousse that you have to blow dry to get a good texture and also tried back combing (it looks ratted on thin hair!) and this powder is the best. I gave it all the stars because it totally beat every other product or trick I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Also, it never made my hair tangled or stiff... you can not use a lot on your roots, a little goes a long way! It&#x27;s a small bottle for that reason, you do not need much. Just like every product, you have to apply a little at a time until you get the effect you want. I only put it on my back roots and rubbed towards the front and it worked great. I do not put it on the rest of my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is pretty fine, so getting volume in the crown is a chore. I&#x27;ve tried lots of different things to make my hair look fuller, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. It&#x27;s a powder, so I thought it might be a nice alternative to baby powder but have more umph. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and you don&#x27;t need much of it. It&#x27;s pretty easy to apply. It shakes out and then you just work it in at the roots and fluff the hair up. It works alright, but it left my hair feeling sticky and gross and made me feel like I wanted to wash it out. Usually, I can get go two or three days before washing my hair. I get better results with dry shampoo and/or brushable hairspray. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t met one person who doesn&#x27;t like this product yet. It&#x27;s amazing and easy to use for both short and long hair</li>
    <li> It does the job but maybe I&#x27;m not doing something right. It stays &amp;#34;teased&amp;#34; looking for only 30 minutes max!?</li>
    <li> My hair is this.  This helps keep it from being so flat.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> It thickens thinning hair in men. It doesn&#x27;t clump up in the bottle. The best part is that you can use additional product such as American Crew Fiber to add texture.</li>
    <li> I threw this item in with one of my orders on amazon and when it arrived i was shocked at how small it was, for the $8-$9 i spent on this i guess i was expecting more, its just barely larger than the size of hotel free-bee products.. as for the product itself my wife claims its good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update, wife says she doesnt like it.. feels \\&quot;icky,gross\\&quot; when applying.. were returning it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just read the mixed reviews about this product, but I can tell you I love Sexy Hair Play and wonder why I never knew this existed. If it weren&#x27;t for my hair stylist giving me a free sample the last time I went to have my hair done I would never have used this product. I have very thin hair and use many other products to get volume. But when I got the free sample I washed my hair, blew dry it and sprinkled Sexy hair play throughout. I just used my fingers to style it and sprayed a little hair spray on it and it gives me the \\&quot;big hair\\&quot; I haven&#x27;t had it ages. If you have a a lot of hair or very thick hair I don&#x27;t see the sense in using this product. But for us ladies with fine or thinning hair it does do wonders. And a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This product is crazy amazing! It has forever changed the way that I will style my hair; I seriously think that I pretty much will use this everyday for the rest of my life. I need to find some way to buy in bulk.</li>
    <li> This definitely gives my hair volume, but it also makes it really dry.</li>
    <li> First I think this is overpriced for such a tiny little bottle !  But,,,,  the stuff works ! I have fine hair,  had breast cancer and hair thinned out.  I use Joan Rivers hair powder to help fill in and now I am using this Texturizing powder for the fullness and it does work wonders on my hair. My hair looks so full now it is amazing ! hair is not stiff and I use the same product for hair spray.  So yes it is very expensive but it does work !  4 stars only because of pricing  10 stars for the job it does !</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that it makes my shiny hair dull and matte looking. Also makes it feel a little sticky.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product, I now have full, thick-feeling hair, as opposed to my normally thiner hair.  Great price, too...$7-8 savings over the store.</li>
    <li> wow, this really does add volume to my hair; a little bit goes a long way</li>
    <li> Definately gives volume!</li>
    <li> Anytime I purchase an item online I read its reviews first. The thing I hate the most is that some product/service reviews are not written by its actual consumers. I&#x27;m here to tell you I am 110% the buyer of this product and Love It! I have fine flat hair and have never come across a product that actually lasts all day. It is amazing. I will say this, once you put it in your hair, it has a really strange feel to the touch, but by looking you cannot even tell you have product in. Hope this review helps you!</li>
    <li> I like this texturizing powder and the hairspay. It is perfect size for travel. Works great so I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Nope. I try a lot of hair products and I hated this stuff. It made my scalp itch like crazy, and it make my hair feel stiff and weird. A waste of money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Want the teased look all day long??? This is the product for you... Love the teased look.. Lo&lt;br /&gt;xks ur tease in all day long!</li>
    <li> I have extremely fine hair,  and since I like to wear it long, I have a lot of problem with it weighing itself down and plastering to my skull. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things (mousse, blow drying it upside down, backcombing, special shampoos and conditioners), and I just couldn&#x27;t get volume to stick around for more than 15 minutes. Then I found an article about hair powders, and decided to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swear,  it&#x27;s like magic! I just make a bunch of parts,  and sprinkle some down each part. Then I flip my head over and work it into the roots. It&#x27;s really bizarre - you can kind of feel it turn from a powder to a liquid,  and then dry. Once it&#x27;s dry, I flip my head back over and BOOM - I actually have the volume I&#x27;ve been trying to get for years! I might try others, but I&#x27;m definitely a hair powder convert now.</li>
    <li> love this product.  it is perfect for separating, volumizing and testurizing short hair styles.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product made my fine hair really sticky and tangled.  It turns from a powder to a sticky gel and then becomes impossible to work with.  I could see this working well for someone that has thick hair but it made my normally silky shiny hair a sticky mess!</li>
    <li> Love it good for styling gray hair</li>
    <li> This is the best volumizing product that I have ever used.  A little bit goes a long way, and so does the small container.  I sprinkle a small amount on the roots where I want volume, and volume is what I get.  I don&#x27;t know what I will do if the manufacturer stops making this awesome powder.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product that helps fine, thin hair feel fuller, easier to style, and have more texture.  Just shake a bit at the roots and work through.  It doesn&#x27;t take much..</li>
    <li> Having played with hair powders before, I was excited to try this one. My hair is medium/fine and when it gets greasy it also gets stringy and limp. I found that with adequate quantity, this does coat the hair and give it a lift, but unlike others, this contains oils, which after a few hours, seem to coat the hairs and  bring it down. Another powder I&#x27;ve used doesn&#x27;t have oil, and it keeps my oil at bay for a day or two while giving lift and more of a rough texture that allows it to style better and fuller, basically without other styling products. Maybe this is better for someone with dry hair who wants to give powder a try.</li>
    <li> This stuff is good. I have very heavy hair and this gives it just enough lift and separation. Wish it came in a larger size. This one&#x27;s perfect for my purse.</li>
    <li> I am african american female. I used it on my virgin hair i didnt see a change........ dont care for it</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that cannot handle very much hair product before it gets greasy.  This powder is the best invention for me!  It applies easily and gives me a few moments to style my hair before it &amp;#34;sets&amp;#34; and stays.  Even my husband uses this one!!!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and it gives me the body without the weight.  I have had friends and family try it and every single person has gone out and purchased it.  It lasts a long time because you only use a little amount and it travels well due to the compact size.</li>
    <li> This product is AWFUL!! It gave my hair little to no volume and WOULD NOT WASH OUT!Right after my shower my hair looked greasy and dirty and felt sticky and oily. I&#x27;m about to go wash my hair for a SECOND time. Terrible and not worth the trouble. DO. NOT. USE.</li>
    <li> I loved the idea of using a volumizing AND texture powder in one bottle...and using in on dry hair? Sadly after 4 uses, it seems like the volume lasted only as long as the cooling effect it had on my scalp (two-five minutes) will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have used it in the past and it is great for volumizing and texturizing. The only thing I do not like is when my hair is straight, the product will make my hair clump in sections by my scalp... I guess that is what texturizing is ha. I do not tease my hair but if I did, I do not think I would have this problem. It is great for curly hair though! Love it.</li>
    <li> You have to use a lot to get your hair dry and later it&#x27;s really hard to wash out of your hair.  I had to wash my hair at least 3 times to feel like it was clean and not so dried out.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  If you style your hair the day after using (I wash my hair every other day), styling is a little tough (depending on what you use to syle - I use a brush with hot wand inside).  It&#x27;s kind of hard to get through your hair with the Powder in.  If you wash every day, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Powder leaves my clean hair looking dull, but it does lift the roots to give the look of fullness</li>
    <li> Good stuff and received in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I have a short pixi hair cut and have fine hair, and this powder really helps create volume and texture. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it makes my hair feel kind of gross, but the way it makes my hair look is great. Also, a little bit of this stuff goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, No smell or color. Does exactly what is describes, lifts and textures hair to look full and big. Would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was so hopeful this would live up to some of the excellent reviews I read, but it didn&#x27;t do the trick for me! And, yes, I read the directions ... So no, my hair wasn&#x27;t sticky because I didn&#x27;t use too much, but no lift and volume. I have straight, thick blonde hair.</li>
    <li> I love the Big Sexy hair products and this one is amazing if you want volume with out the back combing (aka no breakage)</li>
    <li> This great texture and volume to fine hair and other hair types as well.</li>
    <li> This product definitely gives you volume and texture. I wish it had a nice scent but besides that it does what it says.</li>
    <li> i am so happy to find this product....it really works!!!!!  Try it just once and you will be a believer....</li>
    <li> My hairstylist put me on to this product.  Use shake just a small, small amount of powder&lt;br /&gt;onto the roots of hair where you want volume and control.  Or you can sprinkle a SMALL amount&lt;br /&gt;of the powder into your hands, rub hands together and go through hair.  Use on dry hair AFTER&lt;br /&gt;blow dry or roller set.  The key to this product is just a tiny amount goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Hair is not sticky, dull nor does it hurt or fade color.  Shampoos out completely and easily.&lt;br /&gt;Your hair will truly do ANYTHING with this product!  Cheapest on Amazon, will not find in stores,&lt;br /&gt;but can be ordered by you beauty salon.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND I AM SPOILED TO HAVE HAIR THAT WILL NOW DO ANYTHING.....&lt;br /&gt;I WANT!!!</li>
    <li> The product that arrived seemed like it had been used before; I didn&#x27;t feel like it was brand-new, which concerned me. But overall, this is a fantastic hair product and I love it; it&#x27;s the one thing I use most to style my pixie cut. Can&#x27;t go wrong - particularly if you have very fine hair as I do.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair cut into a pixie. I have been trying to get a high crown but other volumizing products and back combing were not achieving what I so desired. On my first try, I finally got the look I wanted. I applied very small amounts in sections and with just a very few strokes of back combing I knew I was getting somewhere because it looked like I had tons of hair! I lightly smoothed the crown, and voila, I had a high crown and I was so thrilled that I literally jumped up and down! It has been 12 hours and my hair still looks great. I have not washed it yet so I hope it shampoos easily --- I saw where a few of the others could not get it removed from their hair without much perservarence. In summary, even if it takes a bit to get it out of my hair, I know I will still use it at least on special occasions but I sincerely hope I can use it every single day! It&#x27;s  my dream come true!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this! I cannot live without it. Just use it sparingly. One bottle will last you a long time. I have had mine almost a year.</li>
    <li> Weird texture and smell. My hair feels dirty after I put some of these powder on..like I haven&#x27;t washed it in days and its full of dirt/gunk. Returning product.</li>
    <li> That bump it look with no hassle :)</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy/curly hair but my roots are really flat. I bought this to sprinkle on my roots under the top layer of hair. I rough it up with my fingers and I have fuller roots.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need very much either.&lt;br /&gt;It feels slightly stiff but not like hairspray and the rest of my hair stays soft anyway so it&#x27;s all good.</li>
    <li> This is the very best product I have found to add volume to my very heavy hair.  I only like to wash my hair every other day, and this powder actually holds up for two days - very unusual to find something lasting!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  I have baby fine hair, and I sprinkle just a little of this in my hair, after I have curled with curling iron, and then run fingers thru hair, and it has so much body.  It makes a huge difference.  And stays that way all day!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love the volume and texture that this product gives my fine hair but it makes the hair very dry to the touch. I like to be able to run my hands through my hair but can&#x27;t really do that if I use this product.</li>
    <li> The product is a life saver. I have zero volume to my hair. Once I sprinkle some powder to my roots without doing anything else but massaging it in, I have the MOST volume. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!! Don&#x27;t use too much, your hair will feel strange, almost dirty. A little goes a very long wait. It makes teasing incredible too!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I sprinkle a small amount on the roots on crown of dry hair and fluff/lift it with my fingers. It gives long lasting lift and volume. I finish off with a spritz of TriAerogel hairspray on top after styling.  This keeps the cowlick on the back of my hair pointing in the right direction. It is a white moist powder which disappears in the hair and does not appear white on brown hair. It doesnt alter the shine or texture of my hair because I use it by lifting the hair and sprinkling on the roots.  It gives a great look to my fine thin hair.</li>
    <li> It did give a bit more extra body if you just use a tiny bit.  Instead of putting directly onto hair (makes it too gummy) , I put a bit onto my fingers and then work it through on section I want lifted..</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Makes my hair feel thicker and stays in place.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my stylist when I raised concerns about using hairspray day after day to create height with my hair. The hairspray build-up was evident and it&#x27;s difficult to control how much of it you&#x27;re using. Plus hairspray doesn&#x27;t do anything to help greasy roots on day-after hair. This stuff is perfect! The applicator is easy and they product is a double-whammy. A degreaser and height-giver in one, with less sticky residue that washes out much easier. Love it!</li>
    <li> Like it but makes my scalp itch...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically contribute reviews, even for products I love.  As skeptical as I was about this powder, I was encouraged enough by the positive reviews to snag this item.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!  If you have limp, lame hair like I do, you&#x27;re going to be thrilled with this stuff.  I wasn&#x27;t immediately impressed, but after playing around with the application of this powder, I lamented that I didn&#x27;t discover this product sooner.  You have to part your hair wherever you need some \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; and lightly sprinkle this magical stuff on your roots...the more you rub it in and fluff your hair, the more volume you&#x27;ll achieve.  Don&#x27;t be dissuaded because it feels tacky and almost damp...it WILL boost your locks if you give it a chance!</li>
    <li> I have wavy somewhat frizzy hair that likes to stay close to my scalp on top, absolutely no lift on the top of my hair. So im always teasing it to give a little lift, but i was looking for an alternative to teasing and this is it! I just put a little on my fingers, apply to root and \\&quot;massage\\&quot; it in. And kind of fluff it. Works awesome without feeling bad or sticky. Looks and feels like natural body. Oh and if used on all my hair i get so much body, it&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Plus helps with second day hair, keeps grease in check!</li>
    <li> First discovered this product when my&lt;br /&gt;hairdresser used it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It does what it says - makes my hair&lt;br /&gt;Big &amp; Sexy!</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and thought I should not buy this. But I am at my wits end with thin hair so decided to just go ahead and try it. I would say that for me, it did not work very well. I very lightly sprinkled on my roots and it did give some lift after I rubbed it in. The major downside is that it made my hair look really gross. Other reviewers said this but I thought it was because they put too much. There is no way I put too much. After using this, you def have to wash your hair the next day/or night. The texture is different of course, that is how it works, but then it starts to break down and look greasy. I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> To expensive for just a little bottle. I was hoping it was bigger size cause of the price. And it seemed like the bottle was half empty anyways</li>
    <li> Love this product great shippers too!</li>
    <li> I came upon this product accidentally when searching for another brand.  In a user review they stated they had baby fine, thin blond hair Like ME, and they loved this product.  They said they don&#x27;t have to backcomb their hair or use a lot of product and hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well...they were right!  OMG this powder works amazingly.  I&#x27;ve put baby powder in my hair in the past to battle greasiness but this may look like baby powder but it is so much more. I have short blond hair.  I couple of sprinkles in my roots and the crown and va va voom, I look like I have a wonderful thick head of hair.  I highly recommend this product for anyone no matter what the color of your hair.  Be prepared for some major volume!</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how well this product worked for me.  I got this product because I like to try different things out.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  I just have to be careful not to put too much on in one spot.  I&#x27;m still working on getting it correctly powdered.  I love it though!!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, curly hair and always struggle with the bottom of my hair being more voluminous than my crown. This product is perfect to add some poof up top. Just make sure your hair is completely dry! I sprinkle it in and the brush through just the crown area. Perfect for when you need texture for updos too.</li>
    <li> Just as noted above, I don&#x27;t notice a difference. I use it at the base, I&#x27;ve tried using it sparingly and in excess, neither of which seems to make a difference. I have better results with a good ol&#x27; bristled teasing brush and hairspray.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times, but it really doesn&#x27;t seem to work. It does when you put it in for the first 5 minutes, but unless you want to refluff your roots nonstop all day or all night, it doesn&#x27;t stay. I won&#x27;t be buying another one.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this product.  It didn&#x27;t provide that much extra volume and makes your hair feel gross.  I suggest dry shampoo and a little back combing.  Works much better.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair feel so greasy. It doesn&#x27;t add much volume either.</li>
    <li> Made my hair very sticky. Hair looked &amp;#34;dirtier &amp;#34; than before I used it .</li>
    <li> What a disappointment. I thought it read 5oz but it&#x27;s actually .5oz. It&#x27;s the size of a sample for the price of full size. NOT HAPPY !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used better volumizing powders but this still does the job as long as you tease your hair.</li>
    <li> Works great with my short bob. Good texture and volume. Just don&#x27;t apply too much.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  I have a lot of hair.  It is wavy and long, but each strand is very thin.  I sprinkle a small amount of this on top, near my roots, after blow drying and before styling.  It leaves my with wonderful volume at the crown, and I can use much less hairspray.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for people with fine hair... I&#x27;ve looked for products that add volume and texture for years and this is the only thing that has worked!  I definitely recommend this product and I will continue to purchase it because its unmatched in the industry!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but it does not work as well as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!  I have already ordered more just to stock up. As has been mention in previous reviews...a little goes a LONG way. The first time I used it I put more than I should have and even though it still gave my fine/thin hair volume, it felt kind of heavy and weighed down a little. I always use a &amp;#34;volume enhancing&amp;#34; hairspray and with this product, I now only use about 1/3 of the amount of hairspray that I did in the past. I would highly recommend this product ESPECIALLY if you have fine/thin hair like me!!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful it will pump your hair as high as u wanna go!!! You can put on wet or dry depends on ur style...I luv it either way..And I got my beastie hooked now LOL!!! So we share!!!</li>
    <li> Best powder!  And good price.</li>
    <li> Not really giving volumzing..but it does help make the hair style hold longer</li>
    <li> I have very very fine &amp;#34;baby hair&amp;#34; that is also very straight and it is also fairly thin.  This product gives my hair body and makes it fuller and makes me look like I DO have more hair than I actually have.  I use it frequently and please note:  A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!  If you use too much there is no bad result its just that you don&#x27;t really need very much for it to work.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair with fairly fine texture that is what I call slippery.  Put a clip in and it will slide out, back comb it and it doesn&#x27;t last, hair spray enough to hold and it looks stiff for a short time and then goes quickly to no hold.  This product is perfect in a small dose the roots to stay exactly where I want all day.  Yeah!</li>
    <li> With this powder, my hair looks and feels normal, but with lots of volume. None of the stiffness or stickiness like comes with mousse, gel or even hairspray. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I have very fine hair, and it lays very limply. Used this powder and it&#x27;s unreal how much volume my hair now has. You just sprinkle a very SMALL amount on your hair, rough it in, and voila... You can really style your hair easily.  Makes your hair hold curl better, too. Love this stuff. It does make your hair feel weird, but that&#x27;s ok with me. Washes out very easily.  If you dont need to wash your hair daily, this stuff will continue to work for days.</li>
    <li> Get this! You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Helps hold the back-comb for tons of volume. My hairdresser used this in my hair, and the next day I still had a \\&quot;bump\\&quot; on top. You just sprinkle it where you are going to back-comb, rub it in to spread it out, and then back-comb your hair &amp; style as usual. It&#x27;s seriously the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Five stars is supposed to mean &amp;#34;I love it,&amp;#34; and I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m quite that excited about this product.  It does, however, make a positive difference.  So it shouldn&#x27;t be given a mediocre rating.  When I first got the product, I thought: &amp;#34;Oh this is just another version of dry shampoo.&amp;#34;  If you&#x27;ve ever used dry shampoo, you know that it fluffs up the hair by employing a powder to absorb excess oil.  This product, however, is more than that.  It goes on like powder, but then it becomes a stiffening agent.  So it really does &amp;#34;volumize&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;texturize.&amp;#34;  The advantage it has over liquid or foam products is that it can be applied precisely where you want it -- on the roots of the hair.  And of course, it&#x27;s dry.  Thus, I find it different from any other hair product I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;One caveat:  the quantity of powder is quite small.  The photo makes you think you&#x27;re getting a container about the size of a medium can of hair spray.  In reality, it&#x27;s more the size of a stick of deoderant.  That said, I use very small amounts of the powder.  So I&#x27;m sure the container will last me a good long while.</li>
    <li> It works pretty well. I get the best results when I tease my hair but sometimes I dont want that look so I try to use it for a little volume and sometimes it work, sometimes it doesnt. Dont forget that this IS NOT a dry shampoo. (I forget that sometimes.)</li>
    <li> Love this product! It gives my fine hair that extra volume but be careful to not use too much or else your hair will feel very rough and dirty at the root.</li>
    <li> Does not work as well as the salon only MEGA DUST and it has kind of a funky smell, but it costs 7 TIMES less than Mega Dust and works about 75% as good so I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> Use a your roots and watch as your hair gets bigger and bigger. The more you use the longer it stays big. But be careful. Too much and you can&#x27;t run your hands through your hair which is why I purchased it. I hate that hairspray stiffness! This allows you to poof your hair up without spray so you can still run your hands through it. Washes out completely. I would start with a dime size of power on my fingertips and apply to the roots of my crown or bangs to give them lift. Works great. For a flat hair day, I use more. But you should experiment until you find the right amount for your needs.</li>
    <li> Had flat fine hair -- this really helped to pouf it out some for my style!</li>
    <li> The powder feels kind of damp when you first put it on. It absolutely gives volume but I don&#x27;t love it enough to buy it again. I will keep looking.</li>
    <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is THE BEST hair product I&#x27;ve ever used, in terms of teasing/giving my hair volume &amp; lift! Simply amazing stuff! A little goes a long ways! I love big hair, and this does the trick!</li>
    <li> Makes my thin hair fluff up at the crown and I can skip the hair spray. Now, the feel of the powder on your hair is kind of sticky-tacky for the lack of a better word. Would I buy it again? Yes, I would, it does the job, just don&#x27;t touch your head.</li>
    <li> this stuff is weird. it made my hair feel so dirty and disgusting and i had no volume whatsoever</li>
    <li> When I got the product in the mail, I was skeptical because it was such a small bottle. However, a little powder goes a long way and my hair definitely has more volume. I wish there was an easier way to apply it to specific areas though, because the powder is a little messy and you can&#x27;t really run your hands through your hair after applying the powder (it gets stuck!). Overall, happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Made my head breakout in a rash. My hair felt sticky and it took 4 washes to get it out.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so awesome. Fast shipping. Decent price</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for me. I used almost a whole bottle and it had the same results as putting baby powder in my hair. I was really hoping this would help combat the FL humidity I constantly live in but I guess I will continue looking.</li>
    <li> Fluffs up my hair with body. Don&#x27;t use too much though or it gets stiff!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING. My hair is so fine and flat that when I tease it, it goes away within hours.  I used this stuff last night along with teasing and hairspray , and this morning it&#x27;s still teased up ! Crazy!</li>
    <li> I never have greasy hair, it takes a long time for me to have hair that actually looks greasy and dirty, but one application of this powder and my hair looked and felt disgusting. I threw it away immediately.</li>
    <li> I have thick, fine hair that is prone to flatness. I have tried many other volumizing hair products but they just make my hair oily. Powder Play actually gives my hair texture and volume. Separately my hair into sections, I shake it throughout my hairs, roots, middle, and ends. I shake my hair out and tousle it with my hands. My hair stays textured and volumized until I wash it. I&#x27;ve been using this for years with both short and long hair styles. Fingers crossed they don&#x27;t discontinue it anytime soon.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff. Discovered this at my beauty shop. Paid a lot more for it there.  It thickens your hair, gives it body, just don&#x27;t put a lot on, sprinkle lightly at the roots, rub in a little. Can use on any color hair.</li>
    <li> My mom and my fiance love this stuff</li>
    <li> this product is a powder that you sprinkle lightly in layers of hair close to your scalp, then &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; with your fingers to get volume, I have long hair which pretty much always has my hair pulled flat against my scalp, but I put this in a couple of layers and WALA, my layers pull apart more, i can get a little bit of a piecy look. it feels similar to dry shampoo once you have it in your hair.</li>
    <li> Adds so much volume to hair . This product adds a ton of texture.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is small, but you don&#x27;t need a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Def. worth getting at this Amazon price.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for turning a Pixie cut into a little Mohawk! That&#x27;s how us trendy girls do things.  ;)  Thank you, Big Sexy Hair!</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  It&#x27;s really great for ladies like me that have thinning hair and like full hair!</li>
    <li> I love Powder Play!  I have very fine hair and I have literally used EVERYTHING to try to get more volume in my hair.  Before this product I was having to use a specific shampoo and conditioner that worked well with two expensive hair products and then my hairdresser introduced me to Powder Play....Amazing!  Love, love, love it!  Little goes a long way and yeah you can feel it in your hair but if you are already trying to obtain a voluminous look with other products then this feel is nothing in comparison.</li>
    <li> I really really wanted to like this. I have a lot of hair but it is very fine and I do a lot and have tried a lot of things to get volume in my hair. I&#x27;ve never tried big sexy hair products but my sister, whose hair is even finer, loves the stuff. In fact she loves this product. I however found it to be a huge waste of money. The bottle is like travel size first of and it did absolutely nothing for my hair. It gave me no lift and did&#x27;t seem to help or detract from other products. For some people mabye it does work but for me I really wished I would have saved my money. I will never purchase again.</li>
    <li> I did not find this powder to perform like advertised.  I administered on my hair and was disappointed that the poweder did not volumize my hair</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s really magic powder. It takes limp hair and turns it into voluminous hair in just a few shakes. I especially like to use this after I wash and blow dry my hair. You know how clean hair can be so limp...just shake a little around your roots and rub it in and like magic you have  body just like when you have a lot of product in your hair. This stuff is great.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff &amp; am now on my second bottle. My only complaint is that the quantity is small. I have to ration this stuff out quite a bit because otherwise, I got through it too fast. It gives my hair a wild, sort of beach-y, unbrushed look....which is what I was looking for. Just a heads up, in case you&#x27;re looking for a more sleek look.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom and she loves it! Next time I will get her the 2 pack. Her hairstylist used it for the first time on her and she was so happy when it came in the mail. I love all of big and sexy&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> This product definitely gives your hair more volume but it also makes it feel a little gritty and dirty while doing that. You need to be VERY careful not to use too much or you will want to wash it out of your hair. It does exactly what it says it does though so if extra volume is what you&#x27;re after, this product is for you.</li>
    <li> This product is PERFECT to make hair look freshly blowout after a day at work. Love it! I would def. recommend this product. And no butane etc like most dry shampoos have that is just creepy to put in your hair!</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for creating that gravity defying style. It turned out to be cheaper than the Boost powder by American Crew but works similarly</li>
    <li> I have super fine hair that I like to keep short. I have tried product after product, only to use them once or twice and not be satisfied with the job the do or how long they hold. This stuff is AMAZING. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. It doesn&#x27;t take much of it, and it makes my hair a million times fuller. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  It really bulks up your hair.  I have white hair so I also use Halloween white spray paint for hair and that works great too - it takes the shine out of your scalp.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff! I sprinkle it on my roots and massage it thoroughly with my fingertips. Instantly it feels &#x27;dirty&#x27; and has much more volume. My hair is medium length, fine, and I wash it daily. The price on here is so much cheaper than what I can find locally.</li>
    <li> I do love this product and I think it is a great way to get volume!  I have very fine hair and it is hard for me to get my hair the way I like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to guess that the majority of people reading these reviews are women. So, women if you&#x27;re significant other is balding or struggles with thinning hair, this product will work WONDERS for them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This magic powder absolutely gives you volume and lift to wear your hair like you haven&#x27;t been able to before. The trick is to apply to dry and combed hair resembling the style you are looking for. Unlike other products such as waxes, pomades, gels, volumizing hairsprays, etc. you will achieve a dry hair look that can be easily styled with your fingers to portray having a fuller set of hair. To make sure your hair style holds, one can apply a hairspray of your choice to complete the style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally stumbled accross this product and it dramatically changed my hair appearance! Thus, I recommend it to men with the aforementioned issues. However, it will take YOU ladies to introduce it to them!</li>
    <li> Love this it works great gives such volume</li>
    <li> I use the big sexy hair hairspray so I decided to try this. Mind you- it is a very tiny bottle but I love it. It gives a nice lift to the roots of your hair. It comes out like baby powder but it definitely helps with volume :)</li>
    <li> but I gave it only one star because I haven&#x27;t actually tried it, but I want everyone to be aware of one of Amazon&#x27;s vendors. I placed on order for it on Jan 2nd and never received it from the shipper (My Beauty Products)! They finally refunded my money on January 24th, but kept the shipping charges that I had paid. Upon reading some of their other reviews, I noticed that other people had the same problem with them. Guess those shipping charges can add up to a chunk of change after awhile. When I spoke with customer service for My Beauty Products, they were very rude and made fun of me. Not only do they have poor taste, they are also cheating people!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm when you want to lift you hair</li>
    <li> This adds easy volume to my hair after I straighten it so it doesn&#x27;t look so boring and flat (my natural hair has plenty of volume on its own). My stylist used this when I got my new cut, and after trying to figure out how to recreate the look I decided to buy some for myself and it has been such a help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fairly easy to use. Just need to add a small amount to the roots and disperse with fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does make your hair more coarse to the touch. I don&#x27;t mind, and I knew that before buying it, but I know that can really bother some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is size. I&#x27;m sure the size was listed aside from the amount, but for the price I suppose I was hoping for a bit more. Oh well, it does still do its job well.</li>
    <li> This tiny little bottle of sticky sexy powder does work (yes, the bottle is tiny but it goes a long way) and my usually flat hair definitely had more volume.  BUT I think I&#x27;m going to stop using it until we are over this crisp and dry New Jersey winter.  It causes so much static that everything I touched created an electric spark.  It took a while for me to figure out why I was so static all of a sudden and through process of elimination I realized that the static was coming from my hair, and was caused by the sexy hair powder.  I&#x27;ll start using it again in the spring/summer months.</li>
    <li> I love the big sexy hair line for my fine hair, and this powder worked really well to add texture. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> I seriously love this stuff!  I have very very fine hair and this really does add the &amp;#34;stiffness&amp;#34; I need for it to feel more coarse.  I don&#x27;t feel like I am going into the bathroom different times during the day to restyle and add more hairspray.  This takes care of it all!  Will definitely be keeping this in stock in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> I bought this a long time ago and I use it often.  I have a stubborn cow lick in the back of my head and my hair want to separate there.  This holds the hair in place so I give it high marks.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t love this.  I have long, wavy-frizzy hair, and this didn&#x27;t work any better for me than a dry shampoo.  Also:  the texture, eww.</li>
    <li> Best volume a southern girl can get!</li>
    <li> my most favorite new hair product.  It adds instant volume and texture.  Perfect for pinup styles and dyed hair that you need to restyle daily without washing too much!</li>
    <li> It follows through on its claim. My hair always fell flat throughout the day, but stayed fluffy with this product. It can be whipped up and revived using only hands! Best for teasing and for places where hair won&#x27;t be touched, it might be a tad tacky.</li>
    <li> I use this constantly. I have a HUGE TON of fine, wavy hair. When I straighten that ton of hair it just lays flat and all of the layers just disappear.  I am in the process of growing out an asymmetric pixie ( prayers are appreciated) so having control over where my hair is going is super helpful at this point. This would be great for people with thinning hair that want body as well. I have bought every conceivable hair product avialable and this remains a go to product regularly.</li>
    <li> maybe i do not know how to use but this is not a dry shampoo. this gives your hair texture yes but its coarse and not pliable. stiff and unmanageable. do not recommend</li>
    <li> It smells s***. Seriously.</li>
    <li> If mean girls invented a product line, this product would make the cut. Sticky, stiff, heavy, greasy and powdery hair anyone? This might be a product you would use in 1985 to give your mohawk the required stiffness, or perhaps aid with those super wings, but any normal usage is definitely not advised. I love the product line generally but have ditched this product forever!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it was such a TINY can.. like a little &#x27;sample size, but I suppose with it being powder it won&#x27;t take as much</li>
    <li> I can essentially throw all of my other hair styling products in the trash. This stuff rocks! So much volume.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly without any problems.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t used this before, this will add to your volume with an easily moveable texture while still standing high. Works especially great if you don&#x27;t use other products for a few days. If you are curious, the texture is like baby powder with a bit of wetness to it.</li>
    <li> The cap was off when I received the product and half of the product was dumped in the bag and couldn&#x27;t dump back in bottle because of the tiny holes.</li>
    <li> You only need sprinkle a very small amount, separate layers with fingers, sprinkle, &amp; lightly massage into roots. Adds volume instantly. I don&#x27;t have to even use my curling iron now</li>
    <li> Maybe the reason is that I wash my hair everyday, maybe because I run my fingers through it a lot... Not sure. All I know is this feels absolutely horrible in my hair.  Wish I could get my money back.</li>
    <li> First, I will say that this product was NOT NEW.  It had been opened and used.  I will be returning it for an exchange.  As for the product, it does make your hair thicker, but it is thick.  I actually like the product, but if you expect smooth hair after, you will not get that.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair feel dirty - I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.  Instead of adding volume to my hair I felt like I needed to wash it after applying this product to my hair. To me it was a nasty feeling!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews on here, I have to say, I was a little skeptical about this product. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered it anyway! This product is impeccable! I wash my hair every other day and my fine long Asian black hair is always falling flat on the second day. Once I use this Powder Play, it lifts my roots and gives my entire hair volume! I am absolutely in love with this product! I will most definitely order this product again!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  I have very fine/thin hair.  This product gives me extra volume that I could never achieve with any other product.</li>
    <li> Works great - and, when you style with this one day, you can easily restyle the next day; add a little water to your hair, then style with dryer and it will look just like it did the day before.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. You sprinkle a little on your hair and it adds a ton of body &amp; texture. I have very fine, thin hair and I&#x27;ve never had results like this. On the bad side this stuff is expensive &amp; when you wash your hair you can&#x27;t get any suds. It&#x27;s weird, but I use it anyway.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was the highest rated and reviewed hair volumizing product on Amazon.  I have used it five times and every time I end up with greasy, limp, sticky hair, so I went back to my other product.  This is just sitting in my cabinet now.</li>
    <li> Great for thinning or fine hair. Just a small amount instantly gives your hair extra volume and styling ease.</li>
    <li> makes head itchy and feel dirty</li>
    <li> Bottle was empty. Hoax. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and hoped that it would help my hair look thicker.  It does this but it also makes my hair feel slightly dirty or matted.  I won&#x27;t purchase this again but you may find it helpful and you may like it.</li>
    <li> I just ordered it try it and my head started to itch so much and my hair was like a sticky mass...I could not brush it...I had to jump back in the shower and wash ma hair again to get rid of it......not for me......</li>
    <li> Wanted to like this but after using it I found my hair to look greasy and the amount of build up it leaves is awful. I&#x27;ve really liked most of all the products by this brand but this I would never recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product works great. I would recommend it to anyone! It has lasted a long time for me and it is a good buy!</li>
    <li> Just not sure if that was what I should of gotten. Not sure I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy from the buyer again! Thank You</li>
    <li> Great product. Way better than I expected.</li>
    <li> This is AMAZING. I use this almost every day. It makes my hair difficult to put my fingers through but I don&#x27;t care because I&#x27;ve gone from fine, homely hair, to big, sexy hair!</li>
    <li> I have fine and short hair.&lt;br /&gt;Trying to use less hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered this product&lt;br /&gt;and wondered what would it do.&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing&lt;br /&gt;A very small amount in hand&lt;br /&gt;and then rubbed into roots of my hair&lt;br /&gt;and I have twice the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Sure gives me volume.&lt;br /&gt;Reading some other reviews&lt;br /&gt;I would share&lt;br /&gt;that the secret&lt;br /&gt;is to use very little and you do not&lt;br /&gt;know it is on the hair...&lt;br /&gt;Now I wonder&lt;br /&gt;what is in this product that does&lt;br /&gt;this to the hair ?</li>
    <li> My friend had given me a bottle of this, I&#x27;d used it and loved the volume it gave my fine hair.  Then unexpectedly, I had to be in a rehabilitative hospital for 3 weeks.  I could not wash my hair for 18 days (I know, Eww!) but was amazed that my hair did not get oily or my scalp itchy. My physical therapist even asked me what I was using.  I didn&#x27;t even need to reapply it; the initial application before my accident carried me through for almost the entire 3 weeks.  I&#x27;ve told several people about this product and I think the physical therapist even might recommend it to her patients.</li>
    <li> On first use I noticed that WAY too much product came out at once with very little shaking so I taped all of the holes EXCEPT for ONE and it worked GREAT!</li>
    <li> Unbelievable. I have thin and very straight hair, it&#x27;s the first time in my forty years that one product really works. Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a while now, and when I first started using it, I wasn&#x27;t satisfied. It wouldn&#x27;t hold my hair the way I wanted, and it did nothing for my \\&quot;bangs\\&quot; (not really bangs, just the front part of my hair). It would make everything else have tons of volume and stand up *except* for the front of my hair. No matter what I did -- put a little, put a lot, apply directly to the roots, etc -- it would not hold that part of my hair up. It looks a little silly when the rest of your hair looks amazing and your \\&quot;bangs\\&quot; are flat and lifeless. And, on top of that, I thought the stuff made my hair feel nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come to find out, this stuff really wasn&#x27;t ever meant to hold up bangs. It isn&#x27;t a gel or whatever -- it&#x27;s a volumizing dry shampoo. Plus, my hair style was really quite long, and it wasn&#x27;t ever meant to do what I wanted it to do. Today, I tried it again, and I realize now how I have to use it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Apply from the back to the front, directly to the roots, and style. APPLY LESS THAN YOU THINK YOU NEED (trust me on this).&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply a second styling product (I use Redken Working Wax) for the areas that this won&#x27;t touch (primarily the front of my hair and the back).&lt;br /&gt;3. Look sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this stuff is used within its scope and in the manner it directs you to, it really is an amazing product. The bottle is TINY, but a little bit goes an extremely long way. It is a little weird shaking what looks like powdered sugar on your hair, but it really is worth it. Give this a try if you have extremely straight, fine, volume-less hair like I do.</li>
    <li> Best travel product for hair ever invented!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but quite frankly I won&#x27;t be using it for daily use. Once in a while when I want to dress-up. It is a very small container and for the money I can find other products that do the same job for alot less. I guess I didn&#x27;t read the quantity carefully enough. Oh well, lesson learned. But just so you know this is a tiny bottle people.</li>
    <li> Was a bit disappointed with this. I have very fine hair that tends to go flat, i was hoping that this product would add a lil volume. It does add texture, but nothing that hairspray wouldn&#x27;t do. It makes my shiny hair sticky ... ughhhh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a great Product !</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give my hair the volume I want.  Will not purchase again.  I like the product Dust better.</li>
    <li> works great but very hard to syle your hair at all after you pour some on I liked the Schwarzkopf product better for hold and manageability but this was  second place</li>
    <li> The powder blends into hair perfectly, doesn&#x27;t show, yet made my hair feel clean &amp; styled very nicely! Love it for quick late mornings when no time to wash hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, I have thin hair and it gives me the volume I need.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty expensive in stores, I found a decent discount (not much) on amazon.  This product was purchased about a year ago, and I am sure if it hasn&#x27;t already, it will fizzle out soon with something new coming in it&#x27;s place.  I have super dark hair - this stuff is white - so even after rubbing it in correctly - I can still see what then looks like a faint gray color hair.  It is a powder  but leaves a really weird feeling in my hair, I don&#x27;t like it - and for what it actually does for my hair (which is fine) - it&#x27;s not worth it, especially if you do not wash your hair everyday, this is not a product you can wear your hair the next day without washing it first.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed. This only made my thin, fine hair greasy and stringy. I think this product might be intended for longer hair- mine is chin length.</li>
    <li> I have several bottles of this on hand, that&#x27;s how often I use it and how much I like it.  As soon as you part your hair and shake some on your scalp and start to rub it in, it feels slightly damp.  This creates the thickness and condition needed to tease your hair.  It&#x27;s like teasing your hair without damaging it because this product makes it so the hair teasing is minimal to achieve the effect you are going for.  You can of course tease your hair as much as you want, but you will find this does half the work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair and this gives me tons of volume and helps hold the style and the backcombing all over.  I use hairspray once I&#x27;m happy with the style, but this product really makes you style hold very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just keep making parts in the hair and shake this down each part and lightly rub into the root area and tease your hair into any style you want.  Excellent stuff.  Some people may find that this will make your hair feel dirty as it does not leave a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling and can feel a bit like product build up I suppose, but I don&#x27;t mind, my hair looks fab!</li>
    <li> Not at all like the spray dry shampoo by same brand.  This one is pretty caustic to hair, while still leaving it greasy looking.  Also it is hard to brush hair after product is in. The white powder never really comes out so you look like you have greasy white hair.  Or a powdered wigs of yore.  I would stick with the  dry spray shampoo, it gives lots of volume and cleans up around roots, brushing is easy because it is not overly caustic.  One of the best dry shampoos out there.  But this product is not good for everyday hair care. Maybe in special effects on a movie.  I love all the other products by this company, but the powder didn&#x27;t come out right. There are better powders if you are partial to them, even plain corn starch would be better.</li>
    <li> An absolute MUST for fine, thin hair. Makes it look twice as thick. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have white hair and its very fine. Ive used all types of products ,but never one that did what I wanted without weighting my hair dowm. I really like this powder,</li>
    <li> I love this product! It works wonders for my curly hair. It&#x27;s a great deal on Amazon and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! I use to use the dry shampoo spray for teasing, but this is amazing! Ye, it makes your hair feel a little rough, but if you tease your hair right, It looks amazing! I have flat hair that is very fine. I use this, and people are asking if I got extensions bc my hair looks fuller! I recommend this to any one! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Its ok, not the best product, but works,....</li>
    <li> Works amazing! The powder comes out white, but has a wet feeling once it warms up in your hand. When I apply it, it does NOT turn my hair or scalp white. It sort of feels like it dissolves in the hair, it leaves a somewhat of a texture and while I can see the effects, I can barely feel them (unlike the heavy feeling of sprays or mouses). I think it&#x27;s my new favorite hair product. I put big sexy hair mouse and a texturizing cream in when my hair is wet, and then use this if it&#x27;s humid or throughout the day when my hair starts getting flat. This stuff is wonderful. I have thin, baby fine hair and I like it long, and this stuff makes it look great!</li>
    <li> I have dark, fine hair.  I had previously used the Regis volumizing powder and that worked like a charm, but it&#x27;s only sold in stores and I don&#x27;t always want to drive the 10+ miles just to get that.  So, I found this on Amazon and purchased.  The powder comes out as expected and disappeared easily into my dark brown hair.  Not as sticky as some reviewers mentioned.  However, there were times a little more came out than I anticipated and that&#x27;s when I noticed the product felt sticky in my hair.  So that could be the cause as it was for me.  Some people complained of the small size, but I found it to be the same size as the Regis powder so I wasn&#x27;t disappointed in the size at all.  This is definitely a little goes a long way product so you don&#x27;t need too much anyhow.  The product did give me some volume, but not \\&quot;big, sexy\\&quot; volume as I had hoped.  In addition thereto, the volume didn&#x27;t last the entire day.  I&#x27;ll finish off the bottle, but probably won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> This simply does me a bit of good, but it will make the hair very dry.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because my hair needs all of the volume it can get! I know several people that use this and their hair is pretty voluminous! I love fixing my hair so I got me some.. It works as it says it does but I would like to throw in that this works best when you put it on your roots and then doing 2 back combs. not teasing exactly just plumping your hair. I haven&#x27;t noticed any flakey looking stuff, or clumping, or anything like that.. it doesn&#x27;t show up in my hair.. it&#x27;s a powder. it works for adding texture to your hair.. It&#x27;s a small bottle but a little goes a long way! You just put this on your roots, it&#x27;s a root lifter. I would recommend to ladies that need a volume boost or texture!</li>
    <li> Works great. Gives my super fine hair some substance even though I have to be extremely careful I don&#x27;t get to much. Makes my hair feel so much thicker!</li>
    <li> This product gives great body to the hair, especially if the hair is fine.  It works better than all other products I have used for body. I first discovered it through my hairdresser at Fantastic Sams but they were out of it so I ordered it online. I have to be careful not to use too much because it makes the hair feel funny.</li>
    <li> helps give my fine hair the extra lift it needs and holds it there.</li>
    <li> Not as great as the texturizer my stylist uses on me, but it absorbs oil better than dry shampoo!  Now I can go longer between washes.  I have dark hair and the white powder seems to blend in just fine.</li>
    <li> This  seems to add body, but the bottle is so small for the price. It won&#x27;t last but a couple of times. I thought it was regular size, I guess I need to pay closer attention to what they say the size is. Won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. It really helps give you height and volume. But, I dont order it any more, because I just use regular baby powder now....its so much cheaper and does the same thing.</li>
    <li> adds some ump to my hair . i like it</li>
    <li> It definitely gives volume and is completely clear and I have dark dark brown hair, and if your not going to run your fingers through your hair it&#x27;s great, otherwise it&#x27;s just sticky and doesn&#x27;t lay right.</li>
    <li> Gives volume like needed. It&#x27;s a powder that turns stick when you start rubbing it in.</li>
    <li> I have fine, long hair and this stuff is the only thing that gives me volume, can easily be &amp;#34;fluffed back up&amp;#34;, and lasts. It is incredible.</li>
    <li> Not so great... I can&#x27;t believe I paid that much for this tiny bottle! :{</li>
    <li> doesnt make your hair greasy... will be part of my hair collection! would definitely use if you need volume!  :)</li>
    <li> The bottle is very very small. I didn&#x27;t use it too much. but I still think it works. I will use it later when my hair grows long.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it claimed too. It definitely adds texture and volume to my fine hair. However I&#x27;ve noticed in the dry indoor heating winter time, it makes my hair very static prone too. When the humid spring and summer days come around I&#x27;ll see if its better then.  I do like it and will order it again.</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for this as I am someone who does not like to wash my hair everyday and the brand is very successful. I realize that when I first got it I was using too much and it made my hair really tacky feeling. Now that I use a smaller amount it definitely works better and takes care of shine, but it still makes my hair feel really weird.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product I buy it for my wife thank u have a good day will buy again</li>
    <li> I must admit, you have to be careful not to use too much of this. I usually close off all but a couple of the holes so I don&#x27;t over-do it. But using this properly (just a little will do) I find I have the little bit of height I need for my chin-length cut. It produces much more fullness than I normally have and if I feel my hair has gone a little flat during the day, just a scrunching up and fluff will bring it right back to life. It&#x27;s a must have for me from now on!</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday when I want to give my roots a little lift. It works great and does not leave white residue. It package arrived quickly and was in perfect condition. I would recommend this seller, and buy from them again in the future!</li>
    <li> Finally the key product I have been looking for. It adds so much grip and texture to my hair. It makes styling and teasing effortless. It absorbs hair oil so if you don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday, it still looks good. If you do wash your hair everyday, it will give you the ability to have that third day grip with clean hair. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Love the looks u can create with this amazing and no messy product</li>
    <li> Shaker top is a bit hard to direct at roots as is the amount, (a spray would be easier). Hair is not soft to the touch after use, but a bit tacky feeling. Definately takes backcombing well after use--so is good if one wants a boufant-style.</li>
    <li> Love this product so much, I ordered some more. It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue and is gives instant volume to hair.</li>
    <li> I used this on my curly hair and it was awful. Everything bad I could say about it, I would. So I gave it away - to someone with straight hair. First time I saw her I thought her hair looked so nice, so much fuller. I told her so, and she said she was using the stuff I gave her.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I got it on the recommendation of a friend. Really helps to volumize!</li>
    <li> best stuff ever if you have thin hair and cowlicks.</li>
    <li> Did not care for the product. Not the product. I just did not like the powder feel.</li>
    <li> made my hair feel creepy. Went back!</li>
    <li> Very good product and have used it for quite a long time now.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thinning pretty bad and this really helps get volume and texture back in to my very thin head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Been using this for quite some time now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for volumizing products--my hair is very fine and limp. I did not like this product at all. I read all the reviews before purchasing and even watched a few youtube videos to be sure I was applying it correctly, but I really disliked it. I didn&#x27;t get much volume help from it (maybe a slight difference but not enough to make up for all I disliked about it), but it feels sticky and greasy in my hair. My roots felt like they were dirty and hadn&#x27;t been washed in weeks. I even had trouble washing it out of my hair--my roots still felt greasy after multiple shampoos! I generally try to go a few days between shampoos (2-3 days), but that was impossible when using this product because it felt and looked so greasy and gross after just a day or two. I know a lot of people love this product, and I wish I had loved it, too! I wasn&#x27;t happy with it at all. The slight volumizing benefit was not worth the greasy, sticky, dirty feel for me. Luckily, it&#x27;s not very expensive so it might be worth a try if you are looking for a volumizing powder, but I think I&#x27;ll stick with baby powder or dry shampoo to try and get some texture and volume.</li>
    <li> It keeps my hair from getting oily so I can skip a shampoo...!  I definitely recommend it, it works!  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> its messy and it doesn&#x27;t work...at least not for me i can&#x27;t speak for everyone else but thank god i didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money on this</li>
    <li> A little goes long way, so the bottle lasts a long time. I have VERY thin hair an this is the only thing that can give me some lift and volume.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this and adores it. Lots of volume with a little bit of powder.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin but very curly hair - basically a nightmare to deal with!  I have five children and not alot of time to dwell on my hair but I had been feeling very down about it&#x27;s appearance as it has been getting finer since I hit my 40&#x27;s - I shudder to think what it&#x27;s going to look like in 20 years but that&#x27;s to worry about later.  I won a bottle of this product just by chance at a raffle event and wasn&#x27;t even sure if I was going to use it, never having heard of this particular product before.  I am familiar with other Sexy Hair products and have used one or two with success, just not this one.  I use it on my dried hair after putting in a curly spray when it is almost dry.  It has made such a HUGE difference in the way my hair looks and I swear I was on the verge of crying tears of happiness!  Now I will admit that the texture can be a bit weird at first but for me at least it&#x27;s no more goopy, sticky or gummy that the hundreds of other products I&#x27;ve put in my hair over the years!  My husband and children know that touching my hair is off limits and not so much because of what it feels like to them but my hair also falls out pretty easy - SO NO FINGERS but mine on this hair!  My hair is shoulder length when dry and I know unless they stop making this product I am hooked for life!</li>
    <li> Works great,  I have fine hair and it really volumizes it with just a little bit on fingertips and looks very natural</li>
    <li> great price, love this item works like a charm and I havent seen this value anywhere else will purchase again, very happy</li>
    <li> I have used every product under the sun and this one really performs without leaving your hair stickly or greasy.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t do anything but give me very dry hair</li>
    <li> If you want to sprinkle toxic crap on your scalp, get this!  I would have never gotten this if the ingredients were listed here.  Would not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have a short pixie that I love to faux hawk and I have that likes to do its own thing.&lt;br /&gt;With the powder play I can shake it on and spike it up... Half way in the day I can change my mind and push it down. It&#x27;s so moldible and amazing.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product at all. It comes off on your hands and clothes and the coverage isn&#x27;t all that great. There are other products out there that are more reliable and less messy.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product, but it is not happening. I have blondish hair that I have to wash EVERY day, because it gets greasy after 12-24 hours. Ive tried all kinds of shampoos and products and nothing seams to help. I put this in my hair around my ear and scalp where it gets oily the next morning and nothing. Didnt seem to help a bit. So now to continue my mission for a effective dry shampoo....</li>
    <li> I use this almost as a dry shampoo.  I have very fine hair, and I use this on the day after I shampoo as I can&#x27;t shampoo everyday.  I have used baby powder, but I don&#x27;t like the baby powder smell following me everywhere.  This product has almost no scent.  I will certainly keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I was kind of expecting something like dry shampoo, which this is not. It definitely gives some serious volume though! I like to use it if I&#x27;m in a rush and I get out of the shower and blow dry my hair and it is like damp and flat this will give it some texture even if you are just putting it into a ponytail it gives my hair body so I don&#x27;t have a limp sad ponytail, but a large voluminous one. The only thing that I&#x27;m not particularly fond of is if I style my hair and then add this, at the end of the day it looks frizzier than normal, but I have thick course-ish hair so some frizziness is expected. This will get you that sexy Bridgette Bardot bedhead look if that is what you are going for.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for fine hair. A small amount at the root and you&#x27;re set all day. Provides a lot of texture, and pliability.</li>
    <li> I always have this wherever I go.. It&#x27;s like my life saver when my hair looks flat and dull..</li>
    <li> Works really well for uplifting at the roots.  Makes the hair feel alittle crunchy to touch but does its job really well.  lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. My hair is like super thin. Adding some of this and it looks great.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing. Hands down best volume product I have ever tried. Gives height and lift with no teasing.</li>
    <li> Flat hair be gone highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have fine (but thick) fairly oily hair that I wash daily or every other day. I was hoping this product would revive my between washes, when it looks a little heavy and weighed down. Um...NO. This stuff made my hair feel heavier, greasier, and grosser. I had to pull it into a ponytail to hide how awful it looked. It did give it a more textured feeling, but it looked so horrible that it didn&#x27;t matter if there was &#x27;texture&#x27;. It was shiny and slick looking. My hair looked ok in the morning morning before I tried the product, then wretched after application. I&#x27;m glad I got a deluxe sample of this product and didn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
    <li> I have thin straight hair that gets greasy by the second day of not washing and I read great reviews about this so I decided to try it out. I&#x27;m sad to say it just made my hair worse. I used it as the instructions said and even followed some youtube steps to correctly apply it but it just made my hair feel wet and look even more greasy. Honestly baby powder does a better work as dry shampoo than this product. I&#x27;m guessing this only helps when you have thicker or more hair than me. Was a complete waste of money for me. Tiny little product for such a high price.</li>
    <li> Best powdered root lift I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
    <li> I thought this would give me more volume without teasing my hair, but I still have to do a lot of teasing still. Just save your money and get a good teasing comb.</li>
    <li> It adds a great amount of volume and bounce to my otherwise limp hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is so shiny and slick after I shower, which makes it horribly flat. This stuff fluffs it up and adds texture, I love it!</li>
    <li> Great product. Gives body to my limp hair and I no longer have to cover myself with hairspray.  Doesn&#x27;t clump or make my hair sticky. I love it.</li>
    <li> This may work for other&#x27;s. But I did not like this product at all.</li>
    <li> Have yet to see how this powder gives volume to your hair, worst purchase, and the size is like a sample.</li>
    <li> Bought it at a beauty shop</li>
    <li> Although I like powder volumizers, I am not as big of a fan of this brand. The actual powder granules were way too big/heavy for my fine, thin hair. It made my hair very sticky and weighed it down. I prefer the &#x27;Smart Solutions Volumizing Styling Dust&#x27; It has a micro dust that works well on ultra-fine, thin hair.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what I was buying as it was my first time purchasing a &amp;#34;powder.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Not a fan. Probably won&#x27;t do that again. What a mess.&lt;br /&gt;FYI - remove glasses before shaking this stuff on. It gets a little messy (oops!)</li>
    <li> For those of you who cannot wash it out of your hair may not be using it right or not using very good shampoo. I am a hairstylist myself and I love this product!!!! Just sprinkle it on your roots close to your scalp and rub it in with your fingers. Poof poof and bam. Also if you tease on top of this makes great volume! And if your hair is looking a little flat during day. No need to use more just poof poof with your hands and your hair is back to looking great!</li>
    <li> It does what it says...  It&#x27;s magic!</li>
    <li> This volumizing powder is a godsend to those of use with out any natural body but like to stay on trend with the current styles. I have long flat hair and this product allows me to have some great up and messy hair styles.  One word of warning though, barely sprinkle this stuff. Otherwise it almost turns tacky and feels gross. Also, if it starts raining and your hair gets sprinkled when you have this in it will turn a little gluey. So otherwise, avoid water (other than washing) when you have this in. Great product though!</li>
    <li> This product is a must have. I&#x27;ve been using this for years to add tons of volume to a simple curled look:) (be aware that a little does go a long way though)</li>
    <li> Works &amp; a little goes a ling way.</li>
    <li> This stuff has cut my hair styling time in half!  I blow-dry the hair, sprinkle Powder Play on, fluff it up a bit and I&#x27;m good to go! And it&#x27;s fun to use, too. I usually spray a tiny bit of hairspray on for windy days, but go without most of the time.  I love this product.[[ASIN:B00390DN34 Sexy Hair Big Sexy Hair Powder Play Volumizing and Texturizing Powder, 0.53 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> This powder is fantastic! It gives my hair instant lift that lasts all day. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky like some similar powders. I just rub a small amount into the roots of my hair. A bottle lasts a really long time.</li>
    <li> I love it. Yes it is sticky at first but work it in and it fades into your hair just adding so much volume.  FANTASTIC! I love it so much.  And I do not have to wash my hair as much.  It keeps it clean looking.</li>
    <li> This is a must have product for any man. It easily adds texture and volume to any hair. I use this as the first product in my regime, and it&#x27;s probably the least replaceable.</li>
    <li> This product had great reviews - more than the root pump plus that I was looking for - so I bought this. It&#x27;s quite smaller than I had expected, but I&#x27;m not a good judge of ounces. It definitely adds texture to my hair, but not a lot of volume. It can also get sticky if you use too much of it, which leaves you feeling like your hair is dirty.</li>
    <li> Perfect buy for hairdos that last all day !! Found out the secret from my hairstylist; I have fine hair. I just sprinkle lightly on my hair after using my curling iron, tease hair lightly for volume &amp; style. I recrive many complements about my hair since I  started to use Sexy Powder Play.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine uses this. She put some in my hair one night before going out, and I swear I felt like a super model! My hair looked fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;Since I bought this, I can&#x27;t get my own hair to do what she did with it, but I have a feeling that has a lot more to do with me, and not the product...</li>
    <li> I have one of these in every bag, and give them away at Christmas too! It&#x27;s like a magic powder that provides enough texture for you to &amp;#34;mold&amp;#34; your hair into great voluminous clouds. Simply sprinkle at the roots, and then run your fingers through your hair near the scalp and jiggle them. The downside is that hair will feel a little dry and papery after that...necessary for that volume. But it comes out after one shampoo so no issues for me. I have been using this for over a year now, with no problems in my hair. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am a long time user of baby powder to get rid of oily hair near the root. This product is AMAZING in comparison. I will never go back!! A lot of reviews talked about the way it made their roots feel gummy or sticky. I have no idea what they are talking about. My roots felt so much better at the end of the day then how baby powder makes your hair feel. I couldn&#x27;t believe the amount of volume it gave my thin, long hair as well. Baby powder will give your hair sort of a matte look, this did not. It covered the oils but made my hair look like it still had that healthy shine if that makes sense. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Works great. Little bottle, but a little goes a long way. Any bad reviews the people already had thick hair or used too much. I can tell you it does not make your hair greesy looking. This really gives hair lift. I love it and use it all the time. Can style without since my hair is so thin.</li>
    <li> Better than any hair paste, mousse or root spray I&#x27;ve ever used. Just a little powder adds volume to my fine, straight hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pure magic. Enough said.</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be a combo dry shampoo and somewhat a volumizer. It did nothing to lessen my hair&#x27;s oil when I couldn&#x27;t wash it right away and needed a quick fix. I went back to my normal quick fix of baby powder. The volume part  was ok, but did not work that great or me. I&#x27;m glad it worked for others, but I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas gift.  Exactly what the recipient wanted.</li>
    <li> This powder actually gives my hair volume. BUT DON&#x27;T OVERUSE! Your hair WILL feel sticky.</li>
    <li> Works great for teasing hair just dont apply to much. I would recommend this product to all of my friends</li>
    <li> I have very fine “fly away “hair and most styling products end up leaving my hair either to “gummy” feeling or looking oily and flatten out the roots. I really didn’t expect much from the product it was more out of whim I ordered it.  I used it two nights ago before going out to dinner; spent the evening in a stuffy, sweltering pizza parlor/brewery. I was amazed my hair didn’t “fall flat” in the humid condition nor did it feel tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I woke up the next morning, combed my hair, fluffed the roots with my fingertips, added a bit more of the powder to the crown and it looked great, no tacky residue, easy to comb through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no troubles combing my hair out once the powder was applied the first night or the last two mornings.&lt;br /&gt;Last night I used a bit of salt water spray to “poof” it up, used a little bit of hair spray on the crown and was out the door for the evening.  I got up this morning and was surprised to find it still had “fluff” left at the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washed my hair earlier and the powder residue was nonexistent, couldn’t even tell I had used anything in my hair two days in row. The powder is white but once worked in with fingertips and hair combed, it isn’t detectable at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(My hair color is strawberry blond/copper red).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The bottle of powder is small, but it really doesn’t take much to get good root lift. I parted my hair and sprinkled the power into the part section, did this with five different section from side to side and across crown, used very little powder, once I had the powder applied, I “finger&amp;#34; fluffed/combed the roots, and was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff turned into a godsend for my thin hair!</li>
    <li> Perfect for maintaining unbelievable volume when teasing/back-combing. I use this EVERY single morning. I pull pieces of hair up from the crown and dab a little powder along the hairline (very little! trust me, a little goes a loooong way. don&#x27;t just pour it out - you won&#x27;t need that much to get the lift/volume you want!) then tease with comb. The volume is insane and it holds all day. I repeat this process through my hair to give it life instead of limp. And I have very fine, flat, straight hair and this makes my hair look full and thick. I will use this stuff forever.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it to keep my hair piecy and full.  I just wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> Why did I buy this? I guess it sounded good, I am such a sucker for a interesting new hair product. It worked better on my dog, we had a big hair nite with cocktails!</li>
</ol>
