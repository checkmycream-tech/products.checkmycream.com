    <li> For a gal who loves fragrance this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I really love the smell of this, with a bit of cocoa and vanilla. I just wish they&#x27;d have it in larger sizes and cheaper price. I use it sparingly because it&#x27;s such a tiny bottle for an unreasonable price :( but I would like to use it more! I always get compliments when I wear it, some say it smells like Vanilla Fields or Exclamation.</li>

    <li> My favorite perfume. This scent has been a staple for me for years, and still impresses. Great buy and seller was great. Will purchase again from this seller.</li>

    <li> I love the smell of this perfume, I have used it for years. When it arrived I was so excited I opened it and went to instantly spray it and nothing. Since I live in Illinois and the temp is freezing right now I figured maybe it&#x27;s just cause it&#x27;s cold. So I put it on my dresser until the next day and went to try it again, still nothing. Wish I could use it.</li>

    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume and is hard to find. The shipping was quick and was in time for valentine&#x27;s day. The price is good but more important is I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> We cannot find in Ici any store so we were VERY happy we can still order this favorite product online.</li>
    <li> It is a great scent but it is really small, I could&#x27;t tell from the pictures but if you look at the fluid ounces they are correct.</li>
    <li> This perfume was one of my favorites when I was younger. It has a nice smell, but if you are buying this size, please be aware that the bottle is REALLY small.</li>

    <li> This is the softest scent I&#x27;ve ever bought. I love how pretty and light it is. The price is right and it&#x27;s perfect for any occasion.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne.  Every time I&#x27;m wearing it I get compliments galore.  However I never seem to get compliments when I wear the &amp;#34;expensive stuff&amp;#34;.  Wonder why.  Try it.....you&#x27;ll be amazed at people&#x27;s comments.</li>
    <li> I have loved this perfume for more than a decade! It has such a sweet smell and I always get compliments when wearing. The price seems very reasonable, although I don&#x27;t know what it goes for elsewhere.</li>
