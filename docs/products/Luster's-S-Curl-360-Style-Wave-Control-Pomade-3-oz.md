      <li>This stuff is the best.</li>
      <li>This prodcut is great for the price</li>
      <li>It smells great.</li>
      <li>but it has a great hold</li>
      <li>Its dificultades but good</li>
      <li>After about a week or 2, my waves were looking good</li>
      <li>and it smells just like baby powder, which is nice because it doesn&#x27;t smell when you get it into your hair</li>
      <li>Easy to use, good smelling product no sticky residue.</li>
      <li>This is a very good product for people with very curly hair.  </li>

      <li>you i love it&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
      <li>Product works very well very effective.</li>
      <li>It washes out easily with water.</li>
      <li>No greasy residue, washes out easily with water.</li>
      <li>Hands the down the best wave cream over produced.</li>
      <li>I was optimistic at first, but then I came to the understanding that it&#x27;s actually better for pomades not to rinse out with water.  </li>
      <li>thanks you i love it&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
      <li>Add a nice wave cap/du-rag, and a solid brush, and you&#x27;re all set.</li>
      <li>this product is more useful than many other pomade products.</li>
      <li>but you still need the right brush and a durag to help.</li>
      <li>This right here....</li>
      <li>If you want a great moustache wax, buy Alien Country Moustache wax.    </li>
      <li>Still is good and helped me on that little hair journey.</li>
      <li>The first time I got waves, it was with this product.</li>
      <li>I prefer instead ones that keep your hair solid more reliably regardless of how hot the day is and how much you sweat.  </li>
      <li>It gives body to curly hair although it will often make your hair straight.  </li>
      <li>Waves are spinning making people seasick thanks 360.</li>
      <li>You can recomb as much as you wish.</li>
      <li>and don&#x27;t use to much.</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>Best on natural African American hair male or female.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great like another reviewer said apply with hair mostly dry not totally but mostly dry and brush</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s hold is decent</li>
      <li>Brushing is the key however, but this pomade helps tremendously.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, decent.</li>
      <li>Made my waves go from bad to great with time!</li>
      <li>It made it very soft</li>
      <li>Wave Builder Wave Butter is light and less greasy.</li>

<li> that&#x27;s about 90 percent dry</li>
<li> Other than that you guys are in for one heck of a ride.</li>
<li> He doesn&#x27;t  use any other product but 360.</li>
<li> I have used just about every other pomade or cream and nothing compares.</li>
<li> and wow, they&#x27;ll be spinning hard!</li>
<li> And it helps increase your wave game to epic proportions.</li>
<li> People are always mistaken him for being Latino, and it seems he has prove 2 them that he  is black, because of the wavy  and shiny texture that u get when u use 360.</li>
<li> My one con is that it is a little thick.  </li>
<li> Not sure if I like the greasy film.</li>
<li> I was expecting the Og with the hard container</li>
<li> At one time, my waves were so thick and spinning until I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t really go wrong with thisproduct, I have been using it for years and will continue to use it for years to come.</li>
<li> I defiantly recommend this to any one trying to get those sea sick waves.</li>
<li> I tried this as a mens moustache shaping wax, and it failed miserably.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Made my waves go from bad to great with time!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great like another reviewer said apply with hair mostly dry not totally but mostly dry and brush and you&#x27;ll be pleased of the results took my waves to the next step</li>
    <li> Best on natural African American hair male or female. I&#x27;m a female I bought this for my son but decided to use on my hair. It made it very soft</li>
    <li> Product works very well very effective. Easy to use, good smelling product no sticky residue. Waves are spinning making people seasick thanks 360.</li>
    <li> This pomade let me say is a bitch to wash out of your hair but it has a great hold and it smells just like baby powder, which is nice because it doesn&#x27;t smell when you get it into your hair and it&#x27;s hold is decent and it does not feel like glue in your hair. You can recomb as much as you wish. I suggest you apply it to hair that&#x27;s about 90 percent dry or you end up combing a lot out. The shine is okay, nothing too flashy. Would reccomend for any hair type.</li>
    <li> this product is more useful than many other pomade products.I defiantly recommend this to any one trying to get those sea sick waves.</li>
    <li> The first time I got waves, it was with this product. At one time, my waves were so thick and spinning until I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Haven&#x27;t had waves since 2006, so I decided I&#x27;d get them back. Haven&#x27;t even used it for a week and they&#x27;re already back! Now all I have to do is let my hair \\&quot;wolf\\&quot; out before getting it cut again and wow, they&#x27;ll be spinning hard! Add a nice wave cap/du-rag, and a solid brush, and you&#x27;re all set. Brushing is the key however, but this pomade helps tremendously.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t really go wrong with thisproduct, I have been using it for years and will continue to use it for years to come. It washes out easily!&lt;br /&gt;  Also sweats out easliy just so you know, I am big on working out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this is a short review but I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> gave me waves so i love it</li>
    <li> Let me say this. This stuff is the best. It smells great. It is not all that greasy. And it helps increase your wave game to epic proportions. If you are looking for a pomade this is your stuff. Just make sure you follow the directions on the can. and don&#x27;t use to much. Other than that you guys are in for one heck of a ride.</li>
    <li> I was expecting the Og with the hard container but I&#x27;ve received the soft round shaped version. Still is good and helped me on that little hair journey.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product for people with very curly hair.  My one con is that it is a little thick.  It gives body to curly hair although it will often make your hair straight.  It washes out easily with water.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works. Not sure if I like the greasy film. Wave Builder Wave Butter is light and less greasy.</li>
    <li> This prodcut is great for the price and I did not have to go shopping or wait in line. As advertised</li>
    <li> Its dificultades but good</li>
    <li> This right here....it works! I thought it wasn&#x27;t but i went ahead and bought it anyways on a whim. After about a week or 2, my waves were looking good haha but you still need the right brush and a durag to help. But still, the pomade does help a lot</li>
    <li> I was optimistic at first, but then I came to the understanding that it&#x27;s actually better for pomades not to rinse out with water.  Because what that means is that it also rinses out/loosens up when you sweat.  I prefer instead ones that keep your hair solid more reliably regardless of how hot the day is and how much you sweat.  Otherwise, decent.</li>
    <li> My son has been using this product  since he discovered it in H. S. He is almost finishing college and he is still using it. He doesn&#x27;t  use any other product but 360. People are always mistaken him for being Latino, and it seems he has prove 2 them that he  is black, because of the wavy  and shiny texture that u get when u use 360.</li>
    <li> thanks you i love it&lt;br /&gt;thanks you i love it&lt;br /&gt;thanks you i love it&lt;br /&gt;thanks you i love ti&lt;br /&gt;thanks you i love it&lt;br /&gt;tthanks you i love it</li>
    <li> Hands the down the best wave cream over produced. No greasy residue, washes out easily with water. I have used just about every other pomade or cream and nothing compares.</li>
    <li> I tried this as a mens moustache shaping wax, and it failed miserably. If you want a great moustache wax, buy Alien Country Moustache wax.    It should be great for hair though!</li>
    <li> This had my waves spinning, i haven&#x27;t had waves since i think 2006 and i am a lost cost for not buying this sooner. This product had my waves spinning and girls was all over me</li>
