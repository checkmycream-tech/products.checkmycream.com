<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i like the shampo and the conditoner. it makes my hair managable.i have already talk about the hair food.i will buy it a-gain.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty good. I like the shampoo and conditioner a lot but it does have a medicated smell. The smell is tolerable--not overpowering. As far as the castor oil, it works just as well as any other. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my hair</li>
    <li> It has done wonders for my hair my bald spot on top of my head I was losing my hair..Thanks to this product my hair is growing.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I am enjoying the sample sizes before buying full size</li>
    <li> When i first bought this i fell in love with it. It really works and it smells so good i will always buy this Jamaican black castor oil kit i love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product that I would tell my friends about.</li>
    <li> I love it great product i started to growth results within a week and half using the grease in the jar i will definitely be buying more</li>
    <li> Its not what I thought it would be. My hair is chemical free and I only use natural products, the shampoo contains sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate</li>
    <li> Overall, It wasn&#x27;t bad. However, you must use hair growth kits consistently and have pictures and measurements to determine if it worked. In my opinion, it didn&#x27;t work for me but I still used the products until they were empty.</li>
    <li> I am truly satisfied with this product, I received it in a timely manner. This product is great for my hair, it has made my hair thicker and healthier.</li>
    <li> Great product! I just love it. I recommend this to anyone needing help in growing their hair. I give this five stars.</li>
    <li> These product is great!!. These sample size is still going strong, meaning I still have product to use (especially the pomade). I wish the conditioner was a little bigger (only because I do a lot of cowashing). This packet came with the leave in oil, shampoo, conditioner, pomade, plastic cap, pen, and note pad (the biggest asset is that the bag is reusable a plus in my book). My hair feels so soft and very easy to manage. My hair is not a dry as it use to be and I have notice some growth. Although, my hair responded well to the products I will not be buying this bag again, only because I am buying each in a full size. This a great buy if you wanting to try Jamaican black castor oil for the first time.</li>
    <li> Use it for my daughters hair..... so good seen a diffrences in 1 month , love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent- worked better than the prescription given from the doctor.  The breakage in the middle of my scalp has filled in so lovely as well as healthly its amazing.  My hair has never been this thick, I had to learn how to comb thick hair which I will share- You must start from the bottom and slowly reaching your scalp,  after you put on your conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> the product itself is allright. it should have came with more detailed instructions. I have sensitive skin and eczema and one of these or all of these made me break out. I have a lot of experience with my skin so I was able to do damage control but 2 months later there are is still dots of discoloration from where the individual bumps were... soooo yeah. if you use and you have either one of my skin conditions make sure you avoid getting it on your skin wear clothes while doing your hair. didnt damage my face(was very careful about face) nor the skin bordering my hairline.</li>
    <li> I received my products and was  very pleased with  the product. They responded to my emails very promptly. I must admit you just don&#x27;t find that kind of customer service much anymore. They handled my situation quickly and they went above and beyond to address my concerns. The product is outstanding and I will reorder again.....If you have any doubts......DON&#x27;T!!! ....I noticed results after 1st use.</li>
    <li> I really liked this set.  It seemed like my hair just stopped falling out after using these products.  Next time I am going to buy the larger size.</li>
    <li> I WILL NEVER USE ANOTHER SHAMPOO OR CONDITIONER AGAIN. THIS PRODUCT IS THE TRUTH. I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE WHO WILL LISTEN</li>
    <li> This product does not work if it do it didn&#x27;t work for me all it did was pull my hair out and when I contacted the seller they didn&#x27;t even want to refund my money I didn&#x27;t wanna giv this product 1 star but I had to be rated</li>
    <li> this product get a lot of raves, but it cause breakage to my hair</li>
    <li> Great products and packaging! My hair was breaking before I started using this system. However, for the past month, the shampoo and conditioner have strengthened, moisturized and softened my hair. I use the treatment as a hot oil/pre-shampoo treatment. And I put the pomade on my ends before straightening. I tend to have somewhat dry hair and the pomade makes my overall hairdo look shiny and smooth. Whether your goal is to maintain your locks or grow your hair, I think the key to this system is that it prevents breakage, as well as, stimulates growth. Definitely a worthwhile purchase!</li>
    <li> I was told About it from a friend I would rate it as 5 star. And hole other people try it</li>
    <li> I love it it leave your hair soft and smelling good I will order this item again</li>
    <li> Love it.. it has been working so good.Will tell anyone to try it, it does work enjoy it for life</li>
    <li> It made my hair softer i can&#x27;t say it worked from growth because i haven&#x27;t seen no growth. The only thing i have seen is soft hair due to using the oil i guess other than that no difference.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s edges are already growing back after 3 treatments. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times. I think I see growth around oneside of my temple are.  I have an appt today at the hairdresser&#x27;s today and she be able to determine if I have new growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think its to early to tell.</li>
    <li> The best hair product for my type of hair and great price. I&#x27;ve ordered product a couple of times and have been seeing great results.</li>
    <li> works great on blowouts... all you need is couple drops of everything... Grew my hair insane the first 4 months i used it. ran out need to invest in more. worth it and it smells good TO ME!</li>
    <li> This product was not what I expected it to be at all I was never order it again in my life and besides the fact that it took about a month to arrive</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying and I love how it work on my hair. Although it got a funny smell that okay. I use it at night before I go to bed and once a week. It great stuff.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure if this product works yet, because I have only been using it for about 2 weeks now. On top of that, I just started using Biotin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say I was content with my purchase. It took about 10 days to receive my package. Everything was clean and spanking new (sometimes supposedly new products come damaged and/or used).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t terrible bad - at least not to me. It is bearable. You can always use a nice smelling oil to hide the smell, so if it works, the smell is the last thing I&#x27;d worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely do business with this seller again, be it BJC or another product I find appealing.</li>
    <li> my daughter is using this product because she cut all her hair off to start over her hair was so damage but I am going to stick with dr.mircale</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I originally just brought the hair oil, but I want to get the whole package this time around. Most people complain about the smell, but I actually enjoy it. Plus, it gets the job done so the smell doesn&#x27;t really matter; I&#x27;ve had worst smell in my head (ACV). My hair just seems so much healthier and shinier. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. Plus, it great for scalp massages. I love it and will continue to use this product for years to come.</li>
    <li> I give this product 5 stars!!! Not only did it help grew my hair 1 1/2 inches long..it also help with my bald spot</li>
    <li> Great stuff made my hair really soft and thick, i just wish that the bottle of oil was a little  larger......</li>
    <li> Great package and products are wonderful for your hair.</li>
    <li> It really works. I was going bald in the temples and after using black castor oil hair is now growing there.</li>
    <li> The smell of the shampoo and conditioner is not like the normal castor oil smell. I love it. I really have seen hrth yet but I have twists so we shall see.</li>
    <li> I have not use the whole kit but I love how the kit was set up. I do like the oil. After I use the complete kit I&#x27;ll write a new review.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I was disappointed when I saw the size of the bottles but pleased to find out a little goes a long way, leaves my hair shiny ,soft and beautiful</li>
    <li> This product did not produce the hair growth I was told it would.  It only made my hair feel heavy and greasy.  I am not at all satisfied with it and I wish I had never heard of it and not wasted my money!  Anyone reading this, PLEASE don&#x27;t waste your money expecting hair growth or better conditioned hair!</li>
    <li> When I received my product I was not expecting what I got very pleased I highly recommend it to any it does work .Am surprised of the result it does work the texture is great not to mention my hair growth and I find no fault in the smell</li>
    <li> I have not used the product yet but based on reviews I am sure I will love it.  I have heard so much about this product on you tube and I am glad I was able to find it on amazon.</li>
    <li> I am beginning to see results from Jamaican black castor oil products</li>
