    <li> I am pleasantly surprised at how well this brush works.  I have very thick hair. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok... it did not work Great on my daughters dry hair... it seems like it works better on wet hair. She she still hurts. But just noticed it works best if you brush the hair from bottom to top. I start on the lower bottom</li>
    <li> This brush really works well. My granddaughter no longer screams when I brush her hair!  Good value.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush. Wish I had bought it years ago. Earlier this summer my daughter and I had a discussion about cutting her hair because she cries whenever I try to brush it and she has trouble brushing it herself. She ended up with a horrible mat this summer and I had to take her in to see my friend who is a hairdresser to get the mat out. I&#x27;ve considered getting a brush like this before but I&#x27;ve never heard great things about them and usually they have bad reviews. But fortunately I was given the chance to review this and I, and my daughter are so thankful. I brushed her very tangled hair today and she didn&#x27;t even wince, not once. She took it everywhere with her the rest of the day to show it off, like a new toy. She inherited my sensitive head and I remember the pain and the tears I had as a kid when my mom would brush my hair, and even now my hair tangles so easily. Given that my daughter has swimming lessons and swim team this summer her hair is getting a lot more dry and tangled than usual so I am so glad to have found this brush. School mornings will also go so much more smoothly when it starts again. I highly recommend this brush! I received this product at a free or discounted cost for my honest and unbiased review of this product. I was not compensated in any way. I will be adding photos when my camera&#x27;s battery charges again.</li>
    <li> it still hurts my 9yr and 4yr old. : ( the brush is nothing they advertise. delivery was  A+ super fast.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome! my daughter doesn&#x27;t fight me to brush her hair anymore.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter has long hair that tangles very easily.  I&#x27;ve spent hours, as has she in fighting with the tangles in her hair.  The MyBesty-Detangler Brush works excellent.  The shape of the brush makes it easy to hold and the bristles do indeed work through the tangles without pulling out hair.  This is a wonderful product and the fun colors are great for kids and teens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I have a detangling brush for my daughter and it works great. So when I was offered this MyBesty-Detangler Detangling Brush from Longglory Gifts for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered one. I wanted to have a spare brush in case one of them disappeared or got lost. Well wouldn&#x27;t you know it, my daughter just happened to lose her hair brush and this one showed up literally the next day. We used it on both wet and dry hair to see if it works just as great on both  circumstances. Well I can honestly say, there were no tears from my cry baby!!! I definitely recommend this MyBesty-Detangler Detangling Brush from Longglory Gifts for you or your daughter.</li>

    <li> I love it! I used it on my 4 year old daughter last night and it was&lt;br /&gt;seriously magic. She has long hair that easily becomes a tangled mess and&lt;br /&gt;brushing it is seriously a nightmare always resulting in screaming and&lt;br /&gt;tears. Last night, she just let me brush and brush and then she made me sit&lt;br /&gt;down so she could brush my hair. Thanks so much! This is going to be our go to&lt;br /&gt;for years to come for sure! I received this product for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
