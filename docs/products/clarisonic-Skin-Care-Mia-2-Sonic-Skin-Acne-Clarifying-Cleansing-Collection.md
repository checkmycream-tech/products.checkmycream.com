<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Totally love it cleans very well but it was harsh on my skin to use twice daily so I use it only at night but as for the cleanser that comes with didn&#x27;t notice any result yet though  I have been using it for over than 2 weeks now didn&#x27;t cure my existing blemishes nor stopped new ones</li>
    <li> I have not been using it that long and have had a break out but my face does feel cleaner!!</li>
    <li> I absolutley love the Clairsonic Mia 2 for acne. I don&#x27;t know what I did before I got it. Everyone I&#x27;ve talked to about them that owns one loves it as well. It is a staple in my facial regimen.</li>
    <li> We purchased this for my son who is 12.  He didn&#x27;t want to use it a first because he thought it implied he wasn&#x27;t doing a good job washing his face with just soap and a face cloth.  We can&#x27;t believe the difference it’s made to his complexion.  Within a few weeks his face is completely clear of any blemishes.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase of the Mia 2 Acne Clarifying collection on Amazon; I was a little concerned that the product may be a fake from reading other reviews about Clarisonic products but the package I received was authentic. I saved at least 30$ over what other beauty stores are charging for this kit. I don&#x27;t have acne per se but do suffer from clogged pores and congestion, and their Acne Cleanser really does the trick for refining and clearing pores. The storage case is pretty useless; I just keep the brush head cap on when not in use and instad purchased the Clarisonic barrel bag to store the kit. I loved the acne cleanser provided and have already purchased a full-sized tube (the scent is rather offputting but it strikes the perfect balance of exfoliation and moisturization so I plan on continuing to use it)</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic Mio 2 Works great! The product arrived promptly and Exactly as described. I Love the minute timer function.</li>
    <li> My daughter began using this system and it has proved to be the most effective acne treatment we have tried.</li>
    <li> It works much better than the spin but too expensive</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved (past tense) this product, and used it daily since purchased in January.  I would give it 5 stars.  However, the switch malfunctioned today, and it&#x27;s apparently no longer eligible for return or replacement by Amazon.  The switch no longer turns it on, and it randomly comes on at other times without even touching the unit.  It also started randomly vibrating while being charged.  The Amazon policy only allows for return within the first 30 days.  I hate to suggest this, because I love Amazon, but you should purchase this elsewhere with a seller who has a better return policy.</li>
    <li> I love my clarisonic. .  I&#x27;ve had the worse hormonal cystic breakouts on my cheek and the clarisonic is trully helping them go away in a week!! I LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I have to say I was really skeptical of this, even though I own and love the Sonicare toothbrush that a dentist recommended to me 15 years ago. Got a lot of use out of that! But $169 is still a  big chunk of change to lay out. I took the plunge anyway, since nothing else I&#x27;ve tried so far has worked to clear up my skin and I&#x27;m not a quitter! I&#x27;ve had it for 3 weeks, and I&#x27;ve used it every morning and night, and I can definitely see a difference. I have fewer active blemishes, and the ones I started with are healing and fading. My skin feels smoother and softer, and I need less moisturizer and foundation. I didn&#x27;t experience the &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; some people speak of, my skin has just gotten progressively clearer and smoother each day. I&#x27;m 43 and have had acne for about 30 years now despite eating healthy and avoiding the sun and so forth. I&#x27;ve tried every non-prescription thing you can think of. So many expensive creams and cleansers and skin care &amp;#34;systems&amp;#34; that were just a waste of time and money. This is a completely different experience. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the device or the cleanser or both, but I&#x27;m going to keep on using it and recommending it to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple of things. First, it&#x27;s hard to believe that 60 seconds is enough. It goes by really fast. I usually start a second cycle to get under my chin for another 20 seconds or so. Second, the acne gel cleanser has a really strange smell to it. Not medicinal, exactly. Not horrible. Just weird and I have to say I wish they could do something about that. Since I use a moisturizer that I like the smell of, I guess I can live with smelling the cleanser for the two minutes I&#x27;m exposed to it. Third, the cleanser does not foam. I tried a couple of different face cleanser products on my arm just to see what would happen, and they didn&#x27;t foam either. Weird. Surely black magic is at work. But I&#x27;m OK with that if it means I can finally have clear skin!</li>
    <li> Ok, the Mia 2 is very nice.  However, the acne brush is a little rough for my skin and dried me out.  I had to switch to the sensitive skin one (blue).  No issues.  Now the solution didn&#x27;t work for me but after a trip to the dermatologist...my prescribed face wash combined with the Mia 2 equals clear skin.  I do recommend adding the Mia 2 to your skin care collection but don&#x27;t purchase the face wash if you have acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Cleans better than any product I have tried.  Keeps breakouts to a minimum.  Comfortable enough to use twice a day.  So glad I purchased it!</li>
    <li> I suffer from extremely oily acne prone skin. I&#x27;d researched the MIA after numerous recommendations from my favorite YouTube MUAs. I researched and placed my order Wednesday. My MIA arrived Friday afternoon &amp; registered with zero issues. After only 1 use my face is noticeably softer to the touch and 2 locations where I had blackheads are cleared! This tool is the Holy Grail of skin care!!!</li>
    <li> My wife had this product on her X-Mas wish list. I noticed a significant difference on her skin right after she used it. Now I know why she loves it and I like it, too:-).</li>
    <li> I really like this product!! It only takes a minute and my face feels really clean and smooth. Definitely a great purchase.</li>
    <li> This product meets every expectation.  Be careful if you use it with the acne cleanser as it contains sal acid and it hurts your eyes when the water runs off.</li>
    <li> I love this system! I bought it for my teen who is prone to acne. It has been very helpful! His skin looks so much better.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item and it stopped working within a month and half and these people wont take it back now</li>
    <li> being on accutane, my face was incredibly dry and peely. this helped take away all the flakes on my face and made my skin look SO much better</li>
    <li> It helped, I just had more expectations about the difference it would make on my skin. maybe it&#x27;s the cleanser but it didn&#x27;t take that &amp;#34;layer&amp;#34; off my skin....</li>
    <li> Thought I was cleaning my face ok until I got this. Great product</li>
    <li> I got this Clarisonic acne clarifying cleansing collection from my bf as a birthday gift. I really like it, and after using it for several days, my skin is much smoother. However, what puzzles me is that the image shown on the webpage has an extra brush head, while what i received has only one inside. I don&#x27;t know who I can turn to, since I contacted amazon, but got no reply.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed using my Mia 2 with the acne brush and sometimes the deep pore brush (haven&#x27;t tried any others yet). I have been using it for about 6 months now. I use it once (or sometimes twice) almost every day, but I do skip a day or two if my skin is extra irritated. I struggle with moderate acne and that&#x27;s what made me purchase this. It hasn&#x27;t cleared up my acne in any noticeable way, neither the red pimples nor the blackheads. However, it definitely makes my skin look and feel better overall. My skin is softer, smoother, and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this brush exfoliates effectively yet GENTLY. I used to use harsh grainy scrubs on my face to exfoliate and I thought it was okay and necessary for acne-prone skin. But since I started using this brush, I can&#x27;t stand those harsh scrubs anymore and I&#x27;m a lot more aware of how they really damage and scratch your skin. This is the way to go! It exfoliates just enough to clean your face thoroughly without scratching or scraping. My skin looks better and feels more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually have to charge the unit about every week or so, sometimes not even that, depending on how often I&#x27;m using it. I don&#x27;t always use it on my body, but sometimes I do (using a separate brush as instructed) and when I do this I may have to charge it more often. When I first got it I was using it twice a day plus a few uses for body, and I was charging it every six days. (Since then I decided once a day was enough.) Anyway, it&#x27;s nice for traveling because even though I usually do take the charger along, I don&#x27;t have to stress much about keeping it charged!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always use the battery up until it stops working before recharging. This is a pain if I forget to charge or if I don&#x27;t notice that it ran out, but it&#x27;s not the end of the world- I&#x27;d rather protect the battery life!</li>
    <li> The money that I spend of getting facials just four/five times a year, I should had purchase this Clarisonic sooner.  I like that the Acne Clarifying Cleansing Collection came with the acne facial cleanser. I am planning on purchasing it soon and so far, I have no skin problems. After one full week, my skin is softer and my prescription acne products absorb faster. The acne brush is fine and will try the other brushes like the one for pores. Just like the other Mia 2, it has a timer and two speeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Must be charge for 24 hours for the first usage.&lt;br /&gt;2. Keep it charge each time after usage, where the socket to plug it, is not near any water.&lt;br /&gt;3. Brush can be clean with gentle soap or non-soap suds products.&lt;br /&gt;4. Can be use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;5. The Claisonic Body brush doesn&#x27;t work with this model.&lt;br /&gt;6. The brush vibrates, not swirl around like Oil of Olay (I still use my Oil of Olay brush when I travel because its lighter than the Clarisonic Mia 2 and its battery operated).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive, yet:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting a facial 6 times a year and multiply by the price of a basic facial: That is your cost of buying a Clarisonic facial brush collection. Even cheap when buying from Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 14 year old daughter and it has really helped with getting her to keep her daily routine.</li>
    <li> This product was purchased for my wife as a Christmas gift. According to her it works great. She also uses on the couch.</li>
    <li> I looooove my clarisonic! My pores no longer have white or black heads, and my face feels smoother! Love it!</li>
    <li> It does clean the face deep.  too clean.  and a little bit too much for my skin.  But it does work.  I like it.</li>
    <li> Love the Clarisonic on a whole, my skin has improved bounds since using it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only boring thing is that it only stays charged for one week :(</li>
    <li> Having suffered from acne for years and used Roaccutane for years, to no avail. I can honestly say this product is amazing for clearing your skin. If like me you have sensitive skin then I would recommend only using the Clarisonic cleanser once a week. I would also recommend cleaning the brush head after every use and not once a week as recommended. Ive seen a huge improvement in hyper pigmentation and reduction of acne. Its so amazing to finally be able to leave the house without any makeup on and not feel ugly for once.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! My skin has never been so smooth clear and healthy. I saw results within one week. I would encourage anyone with Adult Acne to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Gift for daughter and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a store and have had it for a little over a month, after using it twice it doesn&#x27;t work....won&#x27;t charge. And of course I paid cash and didn&#x27;t keep the receipt. So there goes $170 into the trash. Save your money and buy Oil of Olay, or Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> i was excited to buy this product, so last Monday i bought the one part of the acne clarifying system. I diligently charged it for 24 hours and it didn&#x27;t work. So the night after returned it to ulta and exchanged it with another one. again, i charged it for 24 hrs. it seemed to work but i didn t use it because it was late. the day after it wasnt working anymore. So i tried to charge it again for 20 + hrs. fast forward to friday,this thing won&#x27;t charge. I bought two lemons (and i assume Ulta won&#x27;t sell you fake stuff). my question is, how reliable can a 200 dollar gadget  be if i can&#x27;t even get it to work? it  says  that their  manufacturing is negligent and flawed!  if i  could give them MINUS 5 stArs i would. they should check their gadgets before they put them out in the market and waste people&#x27;s time and money!!! i bet the fake ones work better at least they must put some thought into their manufacturing.</li>
    <li> Cystic acne prone face hasn&#x27;t cleared acne as I wished. I noticed I&#x27;ve had more break out in specific area.  I&#x27;m concerned about brush how sanitary is the usage even when rosin inhabit thoroughly? So, I have mixed feelings about the usage of this cleansing device.</li>
    <li> THIS BUSH REALLY HELP ME DEEP CLEAN MY SKIN. EVERY TIME AFTER I USE IT I FEEL MY FACE TURNS OUT TO BE VERY SMOOTH AND CLEAN.</li>
    <li> Great product, I highly recommend it to anyone with skin problems. Helped to clear my face. Promptly sent and received.</li>
    <li> I was absolutely disappointed with this product. I paid almost $200 on this brush. It wasn&#x27;t worth it for me to do the work. The whole unit only vibrated and the brush didn&#x27;t spin. I am sending this back.</li>
    <li> It is really good for acne skin and stops more acne growing！ I was worried if the brush not too soft , but it is really soft and haven&#x27;t  hurt the skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a year, and my skin feels better and cleaner using a Clairsonic rather than using my hands to wash my face, however this doesn&#x27;t clear up my acne</li>
    <li> Good function.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe my skin isn&#x27;t has bad has I thought.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless it makes my day to day easier and faster.</li>
    <li> First of all, I purchased this from b-glowing through Amazon at $149, and it is the legitimate product.  I was a little concerned about fakes being sold through some re-seller, but this is a very good product and my wife loves it.  She swears by it&#x27;s ability to provide a deeper and more quality face cleaning than any other method.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love my Mia2! This has helped clear up my skin and I will never use another product! It is strong enough to clean my pores but not too harsh on the skin.</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic Mia is....incredible. I mean that 100%. I&#x27;d heard about it and all the rave reviews, but didn&#x27;t totally believe them - until I was gifted it for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short? This product works SO well. But, I&#x27;ve seen first hand that it doesn&#x27;t always work miracles for everyone, and the lifespan on its battery seems to fall between 7-18 months. Since the battery isn&#x27;t replaceable, you&#x27;ll have to purchase a whole new Mia. That&#x27;s irritating for the price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping all that in mind though, I still highly recommend it because if it works on someone with horrible acne, it is literally life changing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have absolutely awful acne, particularly on my nose and chin. The type of pimple that lasts for literally 3+ weeks, is so deep and hurts all the time. It&#x27;s puffy and red and nothing you do will make it go away! My self confidence was down, my coverup obsession at an all time high, and the idea of leaving the house without makeup was terrifying. That is not a way to live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stepmom heard about how wonderful the Mia was for other people and decided to gift it to me at Christmas. I was so eager for a change that I used it twice a day, every day. Unfortunately, for 6 weeks nothing changed! I was so bummed. Then, literally one morning, I woke up and the acne was gone. And it didn&#x27;t return. I have never had that deep acne again since using the Mia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe my skin needed such deep cleansing for several weeks to make it work. I&#x27;m not sure. But I recommend the Mia to everyone with acne troubles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, my skin has evened out. It&#x27;s not longer overly oily or dry, and I now only used the Mia once a day or even once every other day. If I forget to be regular about it, I do notice acne returning, so I firmly believe in this product and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads are all different and it&#x27;s important to get the type best for you (the normal is too harsh for me, but I love both the sensitive and the acne ones!). The buzzing effect is fantastic and the brush automatically turns off after a minute so you know when to be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cousin did purchase one to fight her acne though and it did not have the same effect for her sadly. So it does not work for everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE DOWNSIDE: The battery life. You can&#x27;t replace the battery on the Mia, and for $100+ (and $25 brush heads), I really expected it to last longer than it has. The battery just stops holding a charge after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it was amazing - I could go on two week trips and not even bring a charger! Now, it doesn&#x27;t last three days. It&#x27;s very frustrating to always have the battery dying because then the brush doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m hanging onto mine until it fully dies, but after only 18 months, I don&#x27;t want to spend $150 on a new Mia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many reviewers have shared that it died for them after only 7-12 months, and I believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So buy with this in mind. If this isn&#x27;t a price you can spend every 18-24 months, it may not be the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I highly recommend this as a gift or purchase for anyone struggling with acne! It may make the biggest difference in your life!the sensitive and the acne ones!). The buzzing effect is fantastic and the brush automatically turns off after a minute so you know when to be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cousin did purchase one to fight her acne though and it did not have the same effect for her sadly. So it does not work for everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE DOWNSIDE: The battery life.

It may make the biggest difference in your life!</li>
    <li> I really love how clean my skin felt after using this! I also love how easy it is to use, how it has it&#x27;s own timer, and the fact that all of my makeup honestly comes off of my face. My skin is still getting used to it, so I am still having a little bit of trouble spots here and there, but overall, really great!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t under any circumstances purchase this product.  Like many others have reported, mine wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge after a few months of use.  That would be bad enough, but the customer service at Clarisonic is some of the worst I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  They only take calls from 9-5 EST during weekdays, and their wait times are ridiculous. I tried calling multiple times but had to give up after being on hold for 20mins+. I finally got through today and even though this is a known issue, Clarisonic is refusing to honor the warranty since I purchased through Amazon and not an &amp;#34;authorized dealer.&amp;#34; Avoid like the plague.</li>
    <li> Check your machine, we got one and there&#x27;s no serial # on it. I was mad as it&#x27;s a Prime product which Amazon should ensure its genuine. I returned it and am waiting for the \\&quot;genuine\\&quot; replacement. Man, that was a surprise birthday gift for my wife, now I guess she has to be surprised again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the reviews and of course the money back guarantee. I have cystic acne and have suffered for 20 yrs. Well its day 3 and my acne is disappearing . I had a lot of bulbous acne near my chin,its all dried up i dont see the black heads/ white heads on my nose my fore head has cleared up totally. After cleanising I use the Perricone pore minimiser and benzoly peroxide 2% from Vichy group and a moisturizer. The combination did not help much without the clarizonic brush. I am happy to report a 3 day miracle but I will keep at it at continue to update what happens further down the line. so far I am very happy</li>
    <li> Bought to add to the clarisonic in a gift.  Person was happy with the brushes that came with it and the face cleansers was small but enough to  give the user a sample of the product.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an investment that I haven&#x27;t regret. Got this for two months and love ittt&lt;br /&gt;I use it to remove my face makeup every night, cleans your face like no other.&lt;br /&gt;Would&#x27;ve gotten the mia but so glad I went with the mia 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The normal speed setting makes me break out like crazy, probably too drying and too harsh. But with the low setting, it just cleans my pores and makeup in one sitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a magical wand that makes your acne go away just like that. Give it some time and your skin will thank you for it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Worth every penny! The texture of my skin has been transformed. I recommend to anyone with blemishes of any kind.</li>
    <li> I have dermatitis and my skin has always been a little problematic and within the first couple of days I noticed my skin getting more of a glow back to it and it not being so dull.  I did get a couple of breakouts the first couple of days but that was from the Clarisonic doing its job and pulling out all the bad stuff out of my pores.  I love it and it makes my skin feel so fresh and clean after using it.</li>
    <li> I love my clarisonic, it is part of my face routine daily. It is a must have. I wish it came in more colors.</li>
    <li> giving it 5 stars because I bought it for my wife and she seems to love it, if shes happy I&#x27;m happy:-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m oily and acne prone. The Clarisonic used with the right cleanser has dramatically improved my skin. I noticed a difference just days after using it. After using it for 3 months, the large pores on and around my nose really diminished in size, I have way fewer blackheads and I&#x27;m not as shiny. I actually didn&#x27;t care for the acne cleanser that came in the kit; it&#x27;s unsettlingly fragrant and seemed to leave a filmy residue on my skin.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to spend this much money on a facial cleanser. However, I figured that with the guarantee on the product I would give it a try. The unit I recieved is awful! It does not hold a charge more than a day. It is leaky and drips water everywhere and the worst part -- it made my skin worse than before I started I using it. When I called Clarisonic, it turns out the 90 day guarantee does not apply to purchases made on amazon.com. When I asked why or where I could see this - they referred me to their blog like I was from the Planet Neptune not to know that. I should not have to read a blog to know what my options are or are not offered with a product when the product comes in original packaging with the insert confirming the warranty. It appears Amazon will do the right thing and allow me to return this terrible unit. I have no desire for a replacement or anything else from Clarisonic .</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for me. Huge disappointment :( I saw no improvement in my skin and I used it for a month everyday.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering with acne for so long. I don&#x27;t even want to think about how much money I&#x27;ve spent on useless products. This, however, is not in that category! It is absolutely wonderful! My skin felt smoother after first use. I have very oily skin and you can feel how deep it cleans your pores. In just one short week, I have fewer blackheads and less visible pores. If you feel lost with your adult acne and those expensive creams from the dermatologist won&#x27;t cut it, give this a try. I wish I had purchased one of these years ago!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only 60 days old and the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge. My wife loves the product, but it&#x27;s useless if it won&#x27;t make it thru one use before dying. The seller only offers a 30 day refund or exchange policy, but the manufacture warranty is 2 years, so I will be returning it there. I will update at a later date, I&#x27;m hoping that it&#x27;s just a bad unit. Still disappointed that I wasn&#x27;t able to initiate a return thru Amazon, 1st time in many years of being a Prime Member that I was denied a return.</li>
    <li> It worked great for 1year then started malfunctioning. I called clarisonic and they said that these are not authentic clarisonic products so warranty is not valid.  They are pretty good fakes but don&#x27;t last that long.</li>
    <li> I still have my original clarisonic that is very old and still works great. This size is&lt;br /&gt;perfect for traveling and I liked the products that came with it as well.</li>
    <li> Works great! The Clarisonic is easy to use and has a unique charger.&lt;br /&gt;Only used it for a week but so far so good.</li>
    <li> It is good, but without the other things from the order does not make sense. You need to deal with my warrant!</li>
    <li> I LOVE my clarisonic!</li>
    <li> Love my Сlarisonic, thanks to Сlarisonic, my skin looks much better.</li>
    <li> The best, hands down. My face always feels refreshed after using this.</li>
    <li> I Love my Clarisonic!  My face is so clean after using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for three days now and my acne is improved significantly! It really gets everything out of your pores and makes your skin very smooth. I can&#x27;t wait to see the long-term results. There is a bit of false advertising here though because, as others have said, it only includes one brush, not two.</li>
    <li> AMAZING. I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to purchase this! It was definitely worth the investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of this review, I&#x27;ve been using the Mia 2 (Acne Clarifying) for 3 weeks. In terms of my facial skin, I do have combination skin (mostly an oily T-zone, with my cheeks and eyes having dry skin) with a history of mild eczema. Currently, I have been using Clinique Acne Solution and their Moisture Surge. With this purchase, I have been using the Clarisonic cleanser it came with and Philosophy&#x27;s Clear Days Ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first use, my face felt incredibly soft. A week into using it, I noticed at how my facial cleansers were being better absorbed and that I didn&#x27;t have to use as much as I have been before. As a result of that, my face hasn&#x27;t become too dry after washing and I don&#x27;t have to put as much moisturizer (Clinique&#x27;s Moisture Surge) afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My pores have become less visible and my blemishes have gone down a bit. Because of that, my make up has also gone on more smoothly on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Again, it has only been 3 weeks, so I will update this review in about a month or two - when results will be more visible.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo26HTNS0UAD2CX]]Background: In mid 20&#x27;s. Never had acne uptil now. Started to develop isolated painful cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased in March 2014 because alot of other OTC/Rx treatments weren&#x27;t really doing much for me. Note I did not purchase through Amazon because of Clarisonic not honoring their warranty due to them not being an authorized reseller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected the \\&quot;purge\\&quot; phase of using this brush and that&#x27;s exactly what I got, in April 2014.  (As seen in video)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll see the gradual clearing of my skin, including some amount of noticeable fading of old scars. I&#x27;ve used it for approximately 4 months and have great results using the acne brush head, cetaphil wash and the included clarisonic wash. I&#x27;ve recently started using a 20% Salicyclic Wash (purchased through amazon), every week and I think it&#x27;s helping very much as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Clarisonic wants you to replace the brush head every 3 months or so, but mine is still in great condition and think it&#x27;ll last another 4 months or so. Keeping it clean and dry after using is key. Do dip it in some liquid bleach every couple weeks to kill of any bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not think think this was going to help me when I purchased but did so anyways because we spend considerable amount on trying to get rid of the stuff on monthly treatments. If you can live with taking a chance and potentially losing the price of this product, then I would advice you to buy it (this is if you&#x27;re still 50/50).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, i&#x27;ve noticed some people encountering battery issues. Mine does not experience this and lasts at least 3 weeks using it 4 minutes per day on the full speed setting. This has not changed, and I don&#x27;t believe there is any memory effect on the batteries.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts at first, but it is worth it. Skin looks so much fresh and clean after I use it. I haven&#x27;t experience any itching like others. Just very soft skin!!</li>
    <li> So far I love this product!!!!!! I had use it for 3 days and I have to say my skin is soooo much better. It feels soft, clean, and it has clear some of my acne already. I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but since this product is working great for me I thought it was nice to share it with everyone :)</li>
    <li> Omg...it&#x27;s been so long since I could feel pretty without makeup on. I love this system. It&#x27;s the only anti-acne regimen that has shown considerable results. :) It improves the efficacy of my skincare and has drastically improved the appearance of my skin.The Clarisonic brush is awesome! My skin looks so soft and healthy after cleansing with the Mia 2. My acne breakouts are not as severe anymore (I just get one or two instead of like six or so) and the scarring from past breakouts are fading too.</li>
    <li> I like the feeling of this product, and I do feel very put together while using it haha.&lt;br /&gt;However, the cleanser that came with it is terrible.  And I honestly feel like the clarisonic doesn&#x27;t do much either. I have been using it for about 9 months and I see no improvement. It might just be my skin or something, but I really wish it did work cuz I don&#x27;t have this kind of money to waste :/&lt;br /&gt;3 stars for build quality, feel, and cleanliness</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my skin but felt smoother.</li>
    <li> I had heard mixed reviews about the efficacy of this product- my dermatologist wouldn&#x27;t recommend it or tell me not to use it because he had no personal experience with it. I have been suffering from hormonal acne since I was 13- am now 45- bleh! I take an oral medication as well as retin-A to control it, but still get occasional breakouts. I absolutey love this product! I started out using it twice a day and that was too drying for me. Once a day is perfect. I have found no interaction with the Retin-A either. My skin is brighter and smoother- results almost immediately. The only thing I&#x27;ll say is I think the &amp;#34;Mia 2 for acne&amp;#34; was not necessary- I think the only difference from the base model is that it comes with an acne wash- it worked fine but when it ran out I used neutrogena acne wash and that works fine too. Breakouts have diminished- great product</li>
    <li> I love it... my face looks much better.&lt;br /&gt;I love it... my face looks much better.&lt;br /&gt;I love it... my face looks much better.</li>
    <li> The best thing I have done for my skin. It leaves my skin so clean and exfoliated, fine lines seem to have dissappeared.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love the two speed option, as well as the timer that tells you how long to scrub each area of your face. It&#x27;s a dummy free way to wash off makeup, and my skin has never looked or felt better! Definitely worth the investment!!!</li>
    <li> I have had mild acne my entire adult life, so I&#x27;ve tried all types of acne care systems, scrubbers, etc... and the clarisonic is worth every penny.  It is gentle yet incredibly effective.  After just one use my skin was cleaner and smoother, and the existing blemishes were less red and irritated.  After using it for a bit more than a week my pores are smaller and dark spots are fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an effort to save some money I had been using the Olay scrubber system for several months, and while it provided a deeper clean than washing with your hands alone, I found that it really didn&#x27;t exfoliate and clear my skin the way the clarisonic does.  I hemmed and hawed over the money, but I&#x27;ve found the clarisonic to be worth every penny. I&#x27;m sorry I waited so long to buy it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product. I bought this 9 months ago, and i use it daily and haven&#x27;t looked back. I bought it because I was starting to go through acne again, and I worried about pro&#x3D;active on my aging skin. the gentle brush that comes in this set is amazing. it was so weird to have pimples develop under the skin at my jawline, but it went away quickly.</li>
    <li> I received my Mia 2 today and I am already in love!! I have hormonal acne that nothing would help and I have tried everything.  I also have blackheads that nothing would get rid of.  I could hardly believe it but after 1 use - the majority of my pores were clean!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update the longer I own the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading some reviews I became very nervous that it was a fake - so I went online to register it.  It registered just fine and gave me a $25.00 off a $50.00 or more purchase from Clairsonic.  So if your concern is authenticity - rest assured it is real and can be registered through Clairsonic.</li>
    <li> I will never go back to washing my face without this. Even with all of the holiday sales, Amazon still has the best prices.</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loves this!! Its amazing how much cleaner it gets your face even after using make-up removal cloths!! Her face has cleared up significantly since starting to use this!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Clarisonic Mia 2 for Acne prone skin for about a month now, and even my husband noticed!  Out of the blue he commented on how smooth and clear my skin looked.  I have been using it morning and night with the cleanser provided, and my face feels smooth and clean.  Any little bumps I had are gone.  My acne is getting better, but not perfect.  I still have a few pimples that pop up, but not as many as before I started using the Clarisonic.  This product is more expensive, but worth the investment.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Got this with hopes it would help with my cystic acne on the chin. I&#x27;m 46 year old woman. The acne is driven by hormones. Was hoping this would help, but it doesn&#x27;t.  The cleanser is nice. The device works fine. But, don&#x27;t expect any miracles.  Turns out using an antibiotic and Finacea gel (rx) are the only solutions that clear me up.</li>
    <li> A must have to bring out the inner beauty in yourself. Also helps keep your complexion and outlook bright and positive.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift to myself....BEST GIFT EVER!!! I stopped having  breakouts 2 weeks after starting to use it on a daily basis. I wish I had purchased an extra brush. I know it says replace after 3 months, but I think I will have to replace it sooner.</li>
    <li> So a few friends of mine had been telling me for over a year to buy one of these and I was reluctant due to the cost. I finally broke down and bought one after the holidays and have been using it faithfully ever since. My skin has always been a combination of dry/oily and I am prone to getting pimples/blocked pores. The clarisonic is very gentle on my skin and I have been getting nothing but compliments since I started using using it. I found that it also helps prevent ingrown hairs on my face from shaving. I alternate what type of face wash that I use with the brush....one day I will use the acne clarifying cleanser and the next day I will just use my regular face wash. I do find that I have to use a moisturizer afterwards even though the instructions don&#x27;t say that you have to. Anyone who is on the fence about buying one just think of it as being worth it as you will be using it for years to come!</li>
    <li> Easy, Why go to a high priced spa!? Use it in the shower, at the sink, by your make up vanity, anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Can travel with or keep in your handbag. My face and neck look better and I don&#x27;t have spa cost anymore!!</li>
    <li> This product has simplified my skin care routine and I&#x27;m happy to say that two weeks into using it, my breakouts have decreased significantly. I wholeheartedly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like it. Don&#x27;t use it immediately if it is close to the time of the month because it will purge your face like no other, I actually have a permanent pock mark from the boulder sized acne cyst that it made rise to the surface on my nose. It does clear the complexion. I suggest cleaning it with a spritz bottle of hydrogen peroxide after washing the bristles with antibacterial soap. You may still get pimples, acne isn&#x27;t all about clean skin it is also quite hormonal.</li>
    <li> I love how much the clarisonic exfoliates.  I can see and feel my skin is clean.  After using the product my face is exfoliated and feels really soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> worth the money brush is really good gets me super clean, i gave the face wash to my sister i recommend that when you buy the replacement brush get it from clairsonic.com dont go anywhere else because its probably a knock off brush as odd as that sounds</li>
    <li> Used it for a month, didn&#x27;t get what i expect, but I still like it, better than washing face with hands</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas last year. When asked, she said she really liked it. Before that, no unsolicited response.</li>
    <li> It literally made my acne worse. I started using my topical ointments from my dermatologist and my face seemed to be getting better. Then, I started using the clarisonic and it only made my acne worse. It was even worse than before I started using my prescriptions from my dermatologist. I followed all the instructions and cleaned the brush head every night to prevent bacterial growth. However, I do not believe it was from bacteria on the brush. I think the brush just irritated my skin even further rather than \\&quot;cleanse\\&quot; it like it claims. Furthermore, amazon is not an authorized retailer so I cannot return the product for a refund. If you are unsure of the product, buy it from an authorized Clarisonic dealer so you can return it for a full refund.</li>
    <li> I used to semi-successfully use benzoyl peroxide and alpha hydroxy acid to manage my acne-prone skin. That was until I found out I was pregnant and had to figure out a different way to keep my acne under control. I had heard a lot of buzz about the clarisonic, but was a little hesitant to get one because of its hefty price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am SO glad I took the plunge and bought one. My skin has been every bit as clear without using any harsh chemicals or treatments. Even the cleanser I use is just a gentle cleanser for sensitive skin. My skin looks great as long as I faithfully use my Mia twice a day. If I get lazy and skip a day, my pores start getting clogged and it all goes downhill from there. I highly recommend the Mia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t give a review on the clarifying cleanser that came with it, as I have not tried it; but, I would recommend trying out the Mia with just a gentle cleanser first.</li>
    <li> I have wanted a Clarisonic Mia ever since I first heard of it.  I have had acne since I was a teenager and it did not clear up now that I am adult so I am always on the lookout for products that could potentially make a difference for my skin.  I was hesitant to purchase the Mia in the beginning simply because of the price.  This is not a cheap purchase and I wasn&#x27;t convinced that the Mia was different enough from the Oil of Olay Pro X brush (which retails for more then $100 less) to justify that huge price gap between the two.  I diligently researched the two products but wasn&#x27;t even able to find a review online that made the Mia the clear choice.  In the end I purchased the Oil of Olay brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was quite happy with the Oil of Olay brush.  After a few days I noticed that my skin was much smoother and I had a bit less acne.  I also liked that it was battery powered and that I didn&#x27;t have to fuss with a cord and plug.  I found the small brush head comfortable to use and was able to easily clean the area on the side of my nose which is prone to breakouts.  I was pretty happy with this product until recently when I saw an ad for the Mia in a recent issue of Lucky magazine.  The thing that caught my eye was the fact that the Mia now came with a new brush specifically designed to combat acne.  I was intrigued and once again tried to research the differences between the 2 brushes.  As I still could not find a compelling comparative review of the 2 brushes I elected to purchase the new Mia after I saw the price drop on Amazon. Also since the produce comes with a return guarantee from the manufacturer I figured that I had nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Mia, I can say that it is quite different from the Oil of Olay brush.  The brush head is much bigger and the sensation of using the brush is quite different then the Oil of Olay brush.  With the Mia I also noticed that after a few days of use that my acne got a little better.  However with the Mia my skin kept getting better and better until I was just left with a acne on my nose and chin.  Although the Oil of Olay brush made a difference also, the improvement in my skin eventually plateaued.  I must admit that I was quite surprised at how effective the Mia was. Although I had hoped it would produce good results I was a bit surprised when it actually happened.  To me, the two products are similar to comparing a spin tooth brush with a sonic toothbrush.  Although, the spin toothbrush it an improvement over a regular toothbrush it never comes close to the level of clean that is produced with the sonic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot of variation among the the reviews of the Mia on Amazon.  For anyone who is thinking of purchasing either brush I recommend basing your decision on what type of skin you have.  Since I have always had a lot of acne the Mia made a significant difference for me, likely because my skin is producing too much oil and my pores are getting clogged. If you only have a tiny bit of acne or generally have good skin then stick with the oil of olay brush as you might not see enough of a difference to make the extra investment of purchasing the Mia worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a final note, the acne cleanser that comes with the Mia is just fine.  However, the active ingredients are the same as any other acne cleanser so I am not convinced that buying additional bottles at $40 each when one runs out is a good use of money.kin kept getting better and better until I was just left with a acne on my nose and chin.

    <li> I have suffered from acne for many years. I have tried Countless soaps and procedures. I use a sonic care toothbrush and would not be with out it, so I figured this would be just as amazing. It is. The price is high, however I finally have clear skin. It is very gentle allowing your skin to heal, and very effective and removing dirt and oil. If you suffer from acne, you need to try this.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure of what to expect, but i have had this product for 3 days and I love how my skin feels. It feels so clean and soft, and seems to look a little brighter too. As it has only been 3 days, I cannot evaluate whether or not it works for acne; however, I am still enjoying the product.</li>
    <li> I should have bought this a long time ago. I have been struggling with acne for over 10 years and this is the only product that has cleared up and smoothed out my skin! It does draw out all the impurities during the first 4 weeks of use. Now, it has really cleared up during/after week 5.  No more huge bumps under my skin, no more break outs, just smooth even toned skin. I use it only once per day so to not over do it. Some times I use it twice in a row depending on how dirty my face feels. You will love the Clarisonic after the first use! I recommend this to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> My skin is looking better than it has in a long time.  Would highly recommend if you are having difficulty removing dirt and makeup.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have extreme acne all-over. My problem areas are my cheeks and chin. It&#x27;s hormonal cystic acne that you can&#x27;t really see on the surface, just deep and painful blemishes underneath the skin that create a raised bump (no white head). I have tried numerous store bought products that just simply dry-out my sensitive/oily skin. I&#x27;ve tried anywhere from pro-active, neutrogena, biore, birth-control, dermatologist recommended products, and the list goes on and on! This product not only made me realize that I had excess makeup and gunk in my pores after washing throughly with my hands, but the brush and bristles itself give you the most magnificent face wash ever! I want to tell everyone about it! It&#x27;s amazing! I use it every morning and every night. Trust me, I use to be that girl that pretty much gave up on my skin because it wouldn&#x27;t get better, so I wouldn&#x27;t wash my face at night! (DO IT!!!!) it makes a difference. And if you can invest in this Mia 2 Clearisonic you will be WANTING do wash your face because you know how great it works and how good it is for your skin! I am so pleased with this!!!! Definitely worth the money and has made ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN!</li>
    <li> The best for cleaning your face , also super soft and comfortable with ease. Foot and Clarisonic feet package. OMG heaven. I never ever written a review before. Once you get this you&#x27;ll be amazed at how much difference it is compared to olay or the other one&#x27;s yall know.</li>
    <li> It is convenient to use, and very good at cleaning my face. I like it! I will recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these a while back and I have been informed that most if not all Clarisonic&#x27;s on Amazon are fakes. Clarisonic will not validate the serials of these units as real.. do a quick Google search. This was news to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> didnt work for me. i have very oily skin. i&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months :/ and it dried my face out and it made my acne even worse... i regret spending all my money on it but i can&#x27;t return it now :(</li>
    <li> Loved the Mia while it worked.  After 17 months of normal use it stopped working...I called customer care and they told me I could buy a replacement for $85.00.  This is very disappointing considering I paid $120.00 and it only lasted 17 months.</li>
    <li> Use it daily and love it.  Complexion greatly improved.  Very good quality of product.  Came with nice travel case.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best purchase I&#x27;ve made.  It thoroughly cleans your face in timed intervals and has a great travel case so that it doesn&#x27;t accidentally get powered up.</li>
    <li> Made my girlfriend too pretty and then she went and banged a buncha dudes. Recommend for single people like myself now</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife, and she really likes it.  She says it cleans her face better than if she just washed with her hands or a washcloth.  She must like it since she uses it every day.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughters face acne care treatments. She loves how it cleans her face and keeps her acne free.</li>
    <li> Superior cleaning!  I&#x27;ve used the Olay brush &amp; it can&#x27;t compare to the Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the clarisonic Mia 2 to wash my face in the morning, and my skin has been fantastic. I had some raised spots on my face that have been there forever and were gone after using clarisonic a few times. I was really impressed. My pores look smaller and the skin looks much healthier. The brush is gentle and the product is quite small that you can bring with you when travelling. I really love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> good product，when i cleaning my face，i am feeling very neat。so i  will come to buy something and some cleaning product</li>
    <li> This is a pretty great tool.  I use it at night and I have found that over a course of a week that my skin has become noticeably softer.  The brush feels pretty nice against the skin and my skin does feel cleaner.  Highly recommended :)</li>
    <li> This seems to work; after a few months my skin is definitely more smooth and glowing.  I am no longer struggling with dead / dry skin flakes clogging my pores.</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic is everything I thought it&#x27;d be. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I noticed an improvement in my skin after the first use and it&#x27;s gotten better and better.  Ordering it from amazon was a great move, saving about $35.</li>
    <li> I loved this thing so much I now own two of them and also the one with a larger head for body.  it feels great and I can tell a difference in my skin tone and the size of my pores.</li>
    <li> Gentle but serious cleaning - quick too. Noticeable difference in facial skin texture after first use.  And it has only gotten better. If a machine can be a joy to use, the Mia2 is just that! And the results are noticeable -not one pustule after 3+ weeks &amp; blackheads have reduced by at least 90% with 2 cleanings per day. WOW!</li>
    <li> I just received this item a few days ago but am loving it so far. Things that have been trapped under my skin forever are finally coming out. Wish I had tried this years ago! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This ended up being really messy to use, and it didn&#x27;t clear up my skin at all.  In fact, I think it made my skin worse.</li>
    <li> this is a great gadget.  I used the acne cleaners and I am not sure I noticed a real difference.  Plus it does not have the best smell.  I will continue to use my clarsonic but I will use it with my regular cleaner.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about my Mia, it&#x27;s like giving myself a facial everyday ....before my skin was dull sometimes flakey looking and my bff actually recommended it to me, I was a bit skeptical with the price and all. But OMG, my skin glows after using this, I have large pores on my cheeks, the have shrunk and let&#x27;s just say I used to have acne. I use the acne brush but I will be purchasing the sensitive brush soon. I cleanse with cetaphil and my Mia, during the day I apply eucerin with SPF and in the nights I use Retin A, every other night I use CeraVe over my Retin A, and that&#x27;s my skin care regimen I swear by, if I change or deviate I will break out like crazy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter, who had a lot of scars from past acne. She seems to have cleared up considerably after using this daily.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful tool to help with skincare. Removes all dirt and oil and sweat from a long day and refreshes my skin! No other sonic brush is like a Clarisonic!</li>
    <li> This product is worth all the fuss!  I was a little skeptical at first and then decided to buy it with a gift card I received. No loss to my pocket. After trying it for a week, I definitely noticed a difference in how clean my skin was. My acne also reduced. I really like this product.</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with my acne since I was 13, I am now 22 and still can&#x27;t get it all the way gone (even with birth control!).  I have been on ever medication under the sun. My dermotologist told me acutane was the next step if I wanted it gone completely, I said no way to this knowing the crazy side effects that can have.  Needless to say I am a dermotologists nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom bought the orginal mia more than a year ago and every time I went home from college I always stole hers because it made my skin feel sooo clean.  A year later I ask for one for christmas and let me tell you, I was so excited I opened it two weeks before!  A month later and I now have more dramatically clearer skin! I use it twice a day, in the shower in the morning and at night before bed.  I alternate between the clearasonic cleanser that came with the brush in the morning and clean and clear&#x27;s continuous control acne cleanser at night (this stuff is strong!). Once the clearsonic cleanser is gone, I probably won&#x27;t get more. I think its a bit expensive and not that special.  I have also been using a fruit scrub with the brush, this give my skin a nice polish.  I may get a stiffer brush next time, sometimes I feel that this brush is too soft.  Although my mom said her orignal brush was too harsh at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results didn&#x27;t come until a week or two ago, I read that it takes a while in other reviews and it did as well for me.  I have had a breakout or two in the past month, but I will say that my skin is smoother and I am now more comfortable about going out with no makeup on.  I also have noticed my pores are getting smaller on my nose and chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually give reviews, but this product is amazing and totally worth the investment!</li>
    <li> I love my clarisonic device! I am a person who struggled with acne all my life and not even perscriptions meds never worked. When i bought the clarisonic my face was horrible and i was so depressed about being 28 with the worse skin ever. I saw the clarisonic in a magazine article and thought it was a little pricey, but i was sovtorn i thought it couldnt make it any worse. The first time i used it, i felt my skin immediately get better. Within 10 days all but 1 or 2 little spots were left and now 12days later they are starting to clear up to! This clarisonic is not only great for your face, but also for your confidence and personality which i forgot how good they felt.  Please try this product if you have struggles with acne. Its nice to look in the mirror with confidence!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It does what it says it does. I am still dealing with acne, but my skin has improve since I started using it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product! Mine wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than a few minutes. Now, I&#x27;ve only had for a little over a month and will not turn on even after being on the charger for days. Customer service just keeps telling me to try a different outlet. Horrible customer service and useless product.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love my clairsonic!  i purchased the clairsonic mia 2 sonic skin cleaning acne clarifying collection. because i have moderate acne, i heard about it though a girl on YouTube actually, and she said that it could clear up acne shrink inlarge pores, tone and soften your skin and clean your skin 6 times better then your hands alone. so i looked in to it and i found it on amazon and saw all the great reviews but i was a little held back by the price but i thought what the heck ill try  it out. so i just got it in a few days ago and i am very impressed! the first time i used it i saw a huge improvement in my skin ! it was so clean! toned ! and soft! i couldn&#x27;t believe it! and i love the acne face cleanser  it came with too  It works so well for me :-) my acne has improved so much just in these few days i had it and i&#x27;m just so excited about what&#x27;s to come ! and how more beautiful my skin will be!!  i love it!!! i even got my best guy friend to try it out and he&#x27;s hooked and ordering his own. this is a great product and worth every penny it&#x27;s really amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/13 :UPDATE: one year later...&lt;br /&gt;Okay so i stop using my Clairsonic month&#x27;s ago and i wanted to post a one year review for other girls, so the reason why i stopped using my clarisonic was because it started to make me breakout on my cheeks with bad Cystic acne!! everything was going great!! making my skin softer, smoother, less acne!. i used it twice, morning/night/ or just in the morning before work then i started to notice these red bumps on my cheeks about 4 mouths in which i never had!. (i ONLY got acne on my forehead &amp; chin.) so when i started to see big red bumps forming i didn&#x27;t know what was going on?? nothing had changed in my diet/lifestyle. so i talked to my dermatologist about it and she told me it could be my mia that was causing it! she told me to replace the head and see if that makes a difference because it could be getting to worn out and causing irritation so that day i went out and bought a new head i even deep cleaned my mia to make sure that it wasn&#x27;t bacteria that could be causing it either. but with no luck my acne got worse. so started to use my mia off and on and the days i didn&#x27;t use it my skin looked less irritated so i stopped using my mia all together and slowly my face started to heal it&#x27;s self and  go back to normal, my normal anyways. i started to research it on the internet to see if anybody else had the same problem i had with it and sure enough there&#x27;s people out there! i read one article about what was causing the skin to breakout could be the sonic vibration irritating the skin. and i think that was what it was doing to my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this thing twice.. but man! In two days my face is sooo much smoother its amazing. Instantly I noticed this. It also seems like my skin absorbed creams better, and just felt so much fresher! Can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in the next couple of weeks..I will probably write another review then.</li>
    <li> nice product, good manufacture and design, after using, it feels smooth and clean on your face.I&#x27;ll recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 2 weeks into using the Clarisonic. It certainly makes removing makeup and washing my face quick and enjoyable. It has smoothed out the skin on my cheeks and forehead nicely and my skin accepts moisturizer much better than before. However, I have developed the worst breakout ever on my jawline, chin, and around my mouth. That has always been a trouble area for me, but it seems the the Clarisonic has exacerbated the problem. Many reviews have stated that the problem becomes worse before it gets better, so I&#x27;m hoping that this turns out to be the case. I have reduced my usage from twice per day (morning and night) to once per day (just night). This seems to be helping. I will continue to use the Clarisonic for at least a month longer to determine if it will help my skin in the long-run.</li>
    <li> The wife says she loves it, and she does use it at least 5 times a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with acne for as long as I can remember...and I&#x27;m 35 years old.  I&#x27;ve tried every product under the sun, yet nothing ever really seemed to do the trick.  I just resigned myself to living a life with constant blemishes.  I am now 6 weeks into using the Clarisonic Mia 2, and I absolutely love it!!  My face is smoother, softer, clearer and brighter than it&#x27;s ever been.  I did go through about 2-3 weeks of purging, but I stuck with it, and I&#x27;m so happy I did.  I started out using the cleanser that came with the kit, but I&#x27;ve switched over to using Burts Bees natural acne cleanser.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest completely shrugging your routine because you have this brush.  I still use my toner, swipe a bit of blemish stick over my problem areas, and top off with moisturizer.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant to be a cure-all, but rather a cleansing aid.  I&#x27;ve always had to use a good dose of makeup to &#x27;put my face on&#x27; and now, I use way less.  A friend of mine deals with the same issues of adult acne.  It&#x27;s something we&#x27;ve often discussed, what we&#x27;re using, what works, what doesn&#x27;t.  She saw me recently and noticed a difference immediately!  I told her my secret, and she&#x27;s now ordering one for herself!</li>
    <li> Being deployed on an aircraft carrier is really rough on your skin. Not enough sleep, poor diet, (and in my case being a mechanic) causes my face serious damage. Not a day goes by that I get off work and my face isn&#x27;t greasy, oily, and pretty much disgusting. My acne came back and I was suffering because of it. I love this product, it&#x27;s really working so far. I&#x27;m going to continue using, and if my results continue to be good, I won&#x27;t hesitate to purchase more.</li>
    <li> I love my Clarisonic Mia 2!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks awesome! It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m glowing...like pregnant glowing...I&#x27;m practically pregnant....wait .....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;-I</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Mia 2 for 2 months and I love it. Before I was using my hands and expensive cleansers . I notice  my face wasn&#x27;t as clean as I thought, until I begin using my Mia I love the way my face fills afterwards and the glow I now have.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to all. Especially those women who wear make up.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: Mine stopped working and holding a charge after 1 month. Not worth $180 if it doesn&#x27;t work! Lil downgrading my review to one star for this reason!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using the Clarisonic for about a week and can already tell the difference. My skin is softer, smoother, and most importantly - I can see visible reduction of stubborn blackheads and a few spots of cystic acne. I think with continued use and following up with the proper skin care products will all but eliminate the trouble areas that bothered me before. This comes with a large size acne cleanser, which will last a long time since a little seems to go a long way. I also like the magnetized charger that allows you to charge through the case - it just looks more organized and clean when charging on my bathroom counter. I will update review if, after continued use, I find that the product is no longer meeting my expectations or needs. However in the meantime, I am thrilled and kicking myself that I didn&#x27;t order this sooner.</li>
    <li> Several of my friends have the Clarisonic and they raved about it so I bought one. I LOVE it. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but after I use it my skin feels as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt! It is money well spent.</li>
    <li> Its a good product. Only problem is the first 4-6 weeks where your skin actually gets worse before it gets better. I got some additional acne marks that I&#x27;m still waiting to go away. Otherwise, my skin is improving steadily.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different products to get rid of adult acne - that started in my early 30&#x27;s.  I have been seeing a dermatologist of the past year and have used numerous topical treatments and medications - only to find my acne worse and my skin dry, irritated, and red.  I finally decided to try the Mia 2 after reading a number of other reviews.  My skin has improved DRAMATICALLY over the past month.  Initially I used the clarisonic with my own cleanser but now am using the cleansing lotion and clarisonic twice a day.  The cleanser leaves my skin so soft.  Since using this product I have had no new acne and a significant improvement in scaring and redness.  I have cancelled my upcoming dermatologist appointment and just ordered additional cleanser.  This product is incredible! I highly recommend giving it a try!</li>
    <li> This item is essential to my daily and nightly beauty routine. It makes my skin feel smooth and glow radiantly. It has also helped with making my skin appear more even and lightened some of my darkest scars. Overall, I feel it was definitely worth the money and it is something I will always use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on week two now and my face definitely looks different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week one I broke out worse than I had ever, b/c it pulls all the junk in your skin to the surface first. Now day 9 and my face is already cleared up with a few stranglers on my cheeks. It&#x27;s expensive but I think it&#x27;s worth it. Especially after trying everything else!</li>
    <li> I liked clarisonic it&#x27;s make my skin clear and soft</li>
    <li> This is the second one I get, because my husband tried the first one I bought and wants it for himself! But this keeps my face clear and clean , no acne since I use this. I just can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Love the Clarisonic Cleansing Systems! I own both this one, and the Clarisonic PRO (i purchased semi recently after falling in love with the mia and wanting the extra features the PRO had to offer). I use them both regularly, and the MIA is great for traveling. I would recommend these systems to anyone as they are so much better than cleansing with your hands. From someone who struggles with acne - i have definitely noticed the difference in my face since i started cleansing with these systems instead of my hands - I can even FEEL the difference. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I have had acne (severe, but not cystic) since I was in the 6th grade (and I am now 28 years old). I have taken so many medications, tried everything from Proactiv to Neutrogena to a bar of soap to organic lavendar face wash. Each seemed to help in different ways (some would get rid of current but not prevent future, others would end up drying me out so bad the acne would come back in full force a week or two later).&lt;br /&gt;I have recently started using Murad (I was afraid to try it because as a child I was allergic to sulpha - well, apparently I&#x27;m not anymore). The acne cleanser system works great for me, helps clear without over drying. But the surface of my skin was still bumpy and I still had to use makeup (even though most of the more painful acne was gone).&lt;br /&gt;I read a review (well, several reviews) about the clarisonic Mia system, and did a LOT of research comparing it to others out in the marketplace. Well, rather than try out the cheap versions like most of my predecessors did, I decided to just go for it. BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE!! I have not regretted this purchase for even a minute! The first time I used it, I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth my face felt, from even just one use!! And now, after having had it for nearly 3 months, I cannot believe my skin. I look in the mirror and think, wow, I don&#x27;t have acne! I get a few occasional spots, like most people, but I seriously do not have acne any more! And the clarisonic has helped with so much of the resurfacing of my skin. It just continues to get better and better every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this item to anyone who&#x27;s been suffering with acne for as long as I have, and have issues with the unevenness of their skin. Seriously worth the money! Oh, and the face wash it comes with is great, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase it again after this one runs out. I still love using Murad.</li>
    <li> I have tried the Proactiv skin brush system and thought it was pretty good until I splurged on the Mia 2 that had been recommended to me by a dermatologist.  It works great, of course new acne will appear as with any new facial cleanser but dont be discouraged, it&#x27;s worth it.  The only thing that bugs me is the battery life.</li>
    <li> My daughter want this for her son and is very pleased with it.  He uses it every day and loves it.</li>
    <li> I have tried Proactive, Origins, Effaclair, Clinique and all of the store brands.  I have cystic acne as well as regular occasional breakouts. I have been using the Mia 2 with special acne brush heads and their Acne Clarifying Cleanser for 3 weeks.  My face has never been softer, less oily and only 1 new small pimple the entire time.  No dryness and the existing acne is fading quickly. I love this system!  I have only been using 1 other product morning and night after washing,  It&#x27;s called &amp;#34;therapores&amp;#34; and it works as a toner/moisturizer.  With just these 2 products my face is completely clear.  With the money I was wasting with all the other products I had tried, it more than makes up for the price of these.</li>
    <li> Great product I&#x27;m in love with it..It is gentle enough that i use it everyday, feel like my night cream is working better after i started using the brush, my face feels so soft in the mornings and people say I&#x27;m glowing.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my preteen, she was having worsening breakouts across her forehead (blackheads and whiteheads) and starting to breakout all over her face. We have tried multiple products... this was our last effort before the dermatologist... It began to clear her face within a week - only uses it at night and no longer needs any other products. She still gets a few breakouts, but her skin looks sooo much better. She is happy, I am happy... highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve researched the Clarisonic for a while and hesitated to purchase one.  As of today, I&#x27;ve used this product for four days and can tell a difference in my skin on the first day.  My skin is starting to breakout, but I&#x27;m being told “that is normal and keep using it”. It feels like I have a facial both morning and night.  I&#x27;m wondering after using this Clarisonic for a while if the facial feeling will go away since that is more normal.  :^)  At the end of the day, I&#x27;m extremely pleased with my purchase and would recommend the Mia 2 to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was suffering from cystic acne for a while and felt very deflated about it. I felt like I had tried everything (much like other people who suffer from acne). I had a facial a few months before I bought this product and they used a clarisonic on me. I decided to give it a try. I bought it five months ago and I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t buy it before. It was money well spent. I use it two times a day, once in the shower in the morning and before I go to bed. It didn&#x27;t clear up my acne all together or even right away but I still love the way I look. I look 100 times better than I did before this product. It took about a month or so until I saw major results but right after the first use my face felt smoother. When my cystic acne flairs up it is about 70% less worse than it used to be. I feel like I have my confidence back. Also, the flair ups disappear quicker as well. It has helped get rid of acne scars and dark spots too. I use ProActive with this product. I was using ProActivr alone for several months before I bought this clarisonic and did not see results until after I started using it regularly. Trust me you won&#x27;t regret it!!!</li>
    <li> Had heard a lot of talk about Clarisonic, even at my spa...Didn&#x27;t want to go crazy with the larger more expensive versions so picked this version and its perfect. It doesn&#x27;t get in the way, has the scrubbing/battery power I was looking for and I think it&#x27;s making my skin look better. I use it 3-5 nights a week and bristles hold up well. It&#x27;s a mini facial &amp; takes less than 5 minutes!!!</li>
