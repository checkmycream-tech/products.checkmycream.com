      <li>Sure, we&#x27;ll go with that, because this stuff is pretty amazing.  </li>

      <li>I didn&#x27;t order the right colore for shade but over all it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
      <li>Can not cover my spot on my face, but preserve moisture is fine</li>
      <li>I put this on, then do any light conturing needed.</li>
      <li>and it had a really cheap plastic warp around the thing</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m oily, so powder on top is a must, but it&#x27;s totally worth it for the portability and the sturdiness of the case.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for Asian skin type.</li>
      <li>Its great because you can slowly add the foundation to your face and looks more natural , but not to great when you are in a rush out of the house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have very fair combination skin and was worried this would be too dark.</li>
      <li>It does look a bit yellow when first applying, but it blends beautifully.</li>
      <li>One downside would be the puff, which you continuously have to keep clean.</li>
      <li>I have normal skin with mild rosacea, and this covers beautifully and is very natural looking.</li>
      <li>c#21 didnt do much of coverage overall is good, it does light up your skin and made your skin look healthy.</li>
      <li>It blends to my skin color very well and super easy to use!</li>
      <li>Love how it got here so fast.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different one and this one is hands down the best one I have seen yet...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and very moist on my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s with skin that&#x27;s good for my age with just a few fine lines and some sun damage.</li>
      <li>This has replaced my foundation, as I&#x27;ve found it to be much lighter and better at covering my (large) pores.  </li>
      <li>I tried this on its own, without primer or powder, and it is sticky and only lasted about 6 hours.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a damp product that has a fresh smell, which I set with a powder foundation after any concealer that I use.</li>
      <li>I also love that this is not heavy on the face.</li>
      <li>The application and feel of this was fantastic, but it made my skin look drier and older than it is.</li>
      <li>Good coverage , makes your face look moist and doesn&#x27;t turn dark over time.</li>
      <li>I like this very much.</li>
      <li>I would highly highly recommend this if you like light coverage and need to cover discoloration and large pores.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different brands and types of foundations.</li>
      <li>The two things I love most about this product are the air cushion application system and the small amount of product you have to use.</li>
      <li>But other than that, I love it!</li>
      <li>Unlike American makeup where I would come home and have even more acne than before.</li>
      <li>As an avid fan of Korean products, I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds of bb creams and cc creams.</li>
      <li>Prior to finding this, my favorite was Dr. Jart and Etude House.</li>
      <li>This is the first time trying a cushion type of foundation-</li>
      <li>I did expect a more special or just a different finish because of the unique texture of the product, but the difference between this new product and others are not very obvious.</li>
      <li>Great coverage but extremely wet/dewy finish without powder that lasts all day long.</li>
      <li>Some BB creams can look a little pasty, even on my fair skin, but this one is extremely natural looking.</li>
      <li>The instruction is one size larger and with out color (the real one have light purple on some of the pages)</li>
      <li>Too dewy, too much transfer.</li>
      <li>This sunblock really works.</li>
      <li>This fits very well once it oxidizes onto the face.</li>
      <li>It gets very oily throughout the day and it just melt</li>
      <li>Medium coverage but light up your entire face!</li>
      <li>and I was surprised by the light natural feeling this cushion provides.</li>
      <li>It works much better than any other product I have tried.</li>
      <li>This foundation helps reduce the pink significantly!</li>
      <li>It is light to moderate coverage - you can still see some of my darker freckles beneath, which is a much more natural look than I get from other foundations.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this foundation my skin felt soft all day even with the medication underneath.</li>
      <li>This is seriously the most ahhhhhhmazing foundation I have ever used!</li>
      <li>I like this product but it works just like other foundations that fit me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I will definitely order this product again.  Thank You.</li>
    <li> I like this product but it works just like other foundations that fit me. I did expect a more special or just a different finish because of the unique texture of the product, but the difference between this new product and others are not very obvious. It is still a good product and is easy to apply, great for summer weather, too. I am happy to keep using the one I bought but I may not purchase another one after this.</li>
    <li> Too dewy, too much transfer. God forbid I had an itch on my face!</li>
    <li> Love how it got here so fast. This make up is out standing it hide all of your blimshes. It&#x27;s extremely expensive but it comes with 2 make up sets which is nice so that makes it a lot better for me. My skin is nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great coverage but extremely wet/dewy finish without powder that lasts all day long. My boyfriend often touches my cheeks and he was always put off by how wet my face was whenever I used this.</li>
    <li> Nice package when received!&lt;br /&gt;And love this product!</li>
    <li> As an avid fan of Korean products, I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds of bb creams and cc creams. They only left me to break out, be way too pale, and gave an oily, unflattering look. This is the first time trying a cushion type of foundation- and I was surprised by the light natural feeling this cushion provides. I purchased C21 because I am fairly pale, but with a yellow tone. This fits very well once it oxidizes onto the face. It is not super sticky, not extremely dewey to the point where it looks oily. I love it&#x27;s compact design and the coverage! It gives me a natural look without looking like I caked anything on. One downside would be the puff, which you continuously have to keep clean. But other than that, I love it!</li>
    <li> So easy to get good coverage, and I look airbrushed and dewy with this. I&#x27;m oily, so powder on top is a must, but it&#x27;s totally worth it for the portability and the sturdiness of the case.</li>
    <li> I first bought this product after receiving a demo at my local HMart, where the cosmetics counter girl showed me how to apply and use it. I have been a BB cream user for many years. Prior to finding this, my favorite was Dr. Jart and Etude House. The two things I love most about this product are the air cushion application system and the small amount of product you have to use. The air cushion and sponge means that my hands stay clean, and it only takes me three little bounces on the cushion to get enough products for my whole face. one for each cheek, and one for my t-zone. I have normal skin with mild rosacea, and this covers beautifully and is very natural looking. Some BB creams can look a little pasty, even on my fair skin, but this one is extremely natural looking. I wear C21. I&#x27;m not sure what the deal is with the color system, but I know that once I bought the N21 thinking it would be neutral toned instead of cool toned, but it was way WAY too white and ghostly looking on me. For reference, I wear makeup forever HD foundation in 215.</li>
    <li> okay, so I been using lope for a while now and I bought my last one in korea when I was traveling. I order the C21 however when it arrived its NOTHING like the one I bought in korea.&lt;br /&gt;the cushion is half of the thickness of my old one, its not puffy at all. The instruction is one size larger and with out color (the real one have light purple on some of the pages) and it had a really cheap plastic warp around the thing when it arrive.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I can upload pictures so you can actually see the difference, but I don&#x27;t know how to do that in a review...anyways, don&#x27;t buy it girls, this is FAKE!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m 38 and have Rosacea. I have to put on medication daily to keep my skin from turning purple. The medication leaves my face with the feeling it needs to be exfoliated daily. The first time I used this foundation my skin felt soft all day even with the medication underneath. I have fair skin, so with my Rosacea my checks always look pink. This foundation helps reduce the pink significantly! After I remove the makeup from my skin my face still feels soft. It&#x27;s like I got my 20 year old face back. I also love that this is not heavy on the face. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing foundation. Foundation has looked odd on my face for the last 18 years. This doesn&#x27;t cake up or make me look like I&#x27;m wearing anything.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. I have very fair combination skin and was worried this would be too dark. It does look a bit yellow when first applying, but it blends beautifully. I tried this on its own, without primer or powder, and it is sticky and only lasted about 6 hours. With primer and a touch of powder, it lasts all day and then some. It is light to moderate coverage - you can still see some of my darker freckles beneath, which is a much more natural look than I get from other foundations. My only complaint is you have to thoroughly remove this makeup before bed. It will cause breakouts! I have tried many different brands and types of foundations. This has become my favorite.</li>
    <li> c#21 didnt do much of coverage overall is good, it does light up your skin and made your skin look healthy.</li>
    <li> This product is unprecedented in coverage and ease of application. I will never use another foundation other than Amore Pacific IOPE Air Cushion!</li>
    <li> Very good product! I am Asian with fair skin, I always look for some make up to make my skin look natural and flawless! This is magic! After applying to my skin, it&#x27;s gorgeous ! Medium coverage but light up your entire face! I am using the c21, I got compliment from using it from my friend! Secret is this ! Love it!</li>
    <li> It is my second box . I have been using it and I love it! It won&#x27;t clog my pore and my skin looks so smooth and SPF 50 is great!</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin. I stil pre-moisturize before using this product. I pushing motion to place the foundation where I want using  the pad in the compact. This method seems to last all day for me. I have fair skin. The foundation does not make my eyes tear and water. It evens out my skin tones. It doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out or get red when I remove it. It feels wonderful wearing it, like it&#x27;s floating on my skin. I put this on, then do any light conturing needed. I find that it covers so well that I can do less. The foundation lasts about 2 months. The foundation application pad can&#x27;t be washed. My unit came with an additional pad and replacement foundation unit. I think I can use a pair of tweezer an turn the foundation cushion over an get access to more product that has settled on the bottom. This is a really good product for the price. It works much better than any other product I have tried.</li>
    <li> I got the natural 21. Wish I would&#x27;ve gotten the cover 21 but still this stuff is amazing. The packaging is nice and sleek. It makes my skin look amazing and it&#x27;s not heavy either! I immediately saw my skin looking better even when I took it off. It&#x27;s GREAT for super oily skin. It absorbs the oils and keeps your pores clear. Unlike American makeup where I would come home and have even more acne than before. It moisturizes your skin as well! My skin is so soft now and it&#x27;s only the second day. Honestly this is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought for my skin and it&#x27;s not even for cleaning it. 10/10 would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Can not cover my spot on my face, but preserve moisture is fine</li>
    <li> A gift for my girl seems like pretty good …</li>
    <li> I like this very much. It&#x27;s easy to use and very moist on my skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing! It blends to my skin color very well and super easy to use! It doesn&#x27;t clump up and I get an even spread across my face so my skin feels very light.</li>
    <li> This sunblock really works. Some of the best stuff I have ever seen. I have tried many different one and this one is hands down the best one I have seen yet...</li>
    <li> Good coverage , makes your face look moist and doesn&#x27;t turn dark over time. Feels very light and refreshing every time you dap some onto your face. Though its a bit pricey .. this one came with a refill , so technically its almost like paying $15 for each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only con is that the stamp feature doesn&#x27;t allow you to get enough foundation , so I find myself pressing really hard sometimes , or need to constantly dap and pat , dab and pat. Its great because you can slowly add the foundation to your face and looks more natural , but not to great when you are in a rush out of the house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The added spf and moisturize additives is also a plus.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product. But it&#x27;s yellow based.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it if you have oily and blemished skin. This is for someone who has perfect skin already but just wanna add more to it. It gets very oily throughout the day and it just melt which means also don&#x27;t buy it during the summer or wear it. It smells nice and all but not for people who has problems with their skin then this is not the one to get to cover blemishes.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what this stuff is made out out of...angel tears? Sure, we&#x27;ll go with that, because this stuff is pretty amazing.  This has replaced my foundation, as I&#x27;ve found it to be much lighter and better at covering my (large) pores.  It&#x27;s a damp product that has a fresh smell, which I set with a powder foundation after any concealer that I use. You have to press firmly down on the product to get the correct amount of product on the applicator pad, which is something that took me laughably long to figure out.  I would highly highly recommend this if you like light coverage and need to cover discoloration and large pores.</li>
    <li> Too pale for me.. but good coverage and scent</li>
    <li> Do not hesitate to purchase this product! This is seriously the most ahhhhhhmazing foundation I have ever used!</li>
    <li> It was easy and good to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product, it covers, soothing  The skin and smells good.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t order the right colore for shade but over all it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
    <li> Great product leave my skin feels like smoothy, and also give a really healthy color</li>
    <li> This is the only one I will use everyday. It&#x27;s great value and wonderful quality.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for Asian skin type. Highly recommend to girls who has fair to medium skin tone!</li>
    <li> This is fake. Don&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> My first time wearing this product was an unbelievable experience! As a 17 year old i am plagued with acne AND acne scars. So on the day i had work it was humid and sticky as well as 85 degrees outside, i was running around pizza ovens and sweating my butt off. and then i was constantly getting misted by the water at the sink, the Iope stayed put, i have tried a lot of BB creams and they never covered long enough (i tried so many methods) if you have oily skin this is good too because it made my skin feel hydrated even after i washed it off, there was a good level of moisture in my skin. I am very happy with this product, i&#x27;m going to purchase the (Sulwhasoo Evenfair Perfecting Cushion #21 Medium Pink) next to compare these product.</li>
    <li> The application and feel of this was fantastic, but it made my skin look drier and older than it is. There was a shine, but that didn&#x27;t give me a youthful glow, only highlighted lines and made my face look oily and dirty. There is not much coverage, and it may work well for very young perfect-looking skin, but it did nothing to improve my skin&#x27;s appearance. In fact, it made my skin look worse than it is. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s with skin that&#x27;s good for my age with just a few fine lines and some sun damage. I tried this product for several days and in different ways: by itself, over primer, with powder, applied lightly, applied heavier, etc. Nothing made it look good. Ponds Illuminating BB Cream and CoverGirl/Olay CC Tone Rehab are so much better and amazing compared to this stuff. This one was a huge waste of money for me.</li>
