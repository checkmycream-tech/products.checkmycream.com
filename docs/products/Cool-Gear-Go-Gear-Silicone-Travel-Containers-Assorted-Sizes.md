<li> only complaint is that the material they use is a &#x27;shiny&#x27; silicon so it is a little sticky and attracts fuzz easily.  </li>
<li> The products were a complete waste for me and caused me more wasted as the product turned to a thick gelled goop that would not come off of my hands.</li>
<li> This way I can use what I normally use and not feel all dried out.</li>
<li> I also like that I can put the silicone in the dish washer, as they are difficult to clean out by hand.</li>
<li> However, the foundation got a super weird texture to it and lost its liquid consistency, instead turning into something gooey.</li>
<li> The lid unscrews completely from the base for filling, but the mating part of the thread can also be separated from the silicon so you can clean everything.  </li>
<li> Other reviewers have mentioned fuzz and hair clinging to the silicone, I have not had this problem, but I do keep them in a cosmetic bag.&lt;br</li>
<li> Small enough to carry on a plane.</li>
<li> I usually go on three day trips and two of those days are traveling there and back.</li>
<li> Other plastic containers would be brittle or crack.</li>
<li> I put 4 stars because I thought these were the flat ones, however the silicone part of these is a triangular shape, which makes them a little less convenient to pack...</li>
<li> These have been leak proof and that is why I gave in and bought some pricey little travel containers.  </li>
<li> However, they stand up because they are triangular, which also makes them a little bulkier to pack.  </li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with leaking,  but I also have never used them with oil.  </li>
<li> I gave it 4 stars because the plastic is a little flimsy and it can be hard to put the cap on and keep it on.</li>
<li> Especially for anyone with expensive hair products.</li>
<li> I have used them on about 4 trips in the past 12 months without a problem.</li>
<li> Moroccan Oil&amp;#34; hair product in one of the small bottles</li>
<li> The lids feel sturdy, but are also at times difficult to open.  </li>
<li> and I ended up with a very thick gooey unusable mess.  </li>
<li> I do like the silicone over the hard plastic to put shampoo, moisturizer, hand lotions, shave gel or cream...</li>
<li> twist off the flip-top lid and use a really small soon to scoop refills of deodorant into the bottle through the generous sized hole in the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect!</li>
<li> and then it can get a little difficult.</li>
<li> And creepy.</li>
<li> Weird.  </li>
<li> I keep one in my car, and in the cold temperature, the &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; is still malleable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These are wonderful for small trips. I usually go on three day trips and two of those days are traveling there and back. I do not like Hotel shampoo, conditioner and soap. This way I can use what I normally use and not feel all dried out. A definite plus in my book.</li>
    <li> These are great for travel partners, good quality.  I bought these for stocking stuffers for my BIG kids!</li>
    <li> I thought these would be perfect.  Love the sizes, and they look and feel great.  Upon putting stuff in them though, there is some sort of chemical reaction with the plastic (rubber?  silicone?) and what you end up with is a tube of semi-solid gelly goo.  I thought it was just the argan oil - maybe oil and this material aren&#x27;t friends - but it happened with my shampoo too.  Weird.  And gross.  And creepy.</li>
    <li> Like most other 1-2 star reviews, I placed an expensive product in the tube (after testing with water overnight - them not leaking seemed too good to be true). When I landed at my destination and went to get ready, the tubes felt empty. They had also expanded to the point the lid no longer fits. I have photos, but cannot figure out how to add them to a review. The products were a complete waste for me and caused me more wasted as the product turned to a thick gelled goop that would not come off of my hands. I would not recommend this product. Especially for anyone with expensive hair products.</li>
    <li> Love these for my home made lotions, soaps, etc.  They don&#x27;t leak and are just the right size for on the go.</li>
    <li> I have bought many different travel containers over the years, and this is one of my favorites.  First of all, I love the feel of the silicone on the Go-Gear containers, it is very soft and nice to touch.  Other reviewers have mentioned fuzz and hair clinging to the silicone, I have not had this problem, but I do keep them in a cosmetic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these containers for all kinds of things that I would want in a smaller container (I often buy in bulk): shampoo, soap, sunscreen, lotion, etc.  I like that they are very easy to fill, due to the fact that they stand up.  However, they stand up because they are triangular, which also makes them a little bulkier to pack.  The lids feel sturdy, but are also at times difficult to open.  I also like that I can put the silicone in the dish washer, as they are difficult to clean out by hand.</li>
    <li> These have been leak proof and that is why I gave in and bought some pricey little travel containers.  I love how easy they are to fill, clean, and get the last bit out.  The downside is they are rather chunky and take up a lot more room in my carry on than other travel containers.  I can&#x27;t fit as many things in the quart sized bag required at the airport.</li>
    <li> love this product! exactly what i was wanting, they don&#x27;t leak and clean very easily! i highly recommend for traveling!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great and easy to use. The are perfect for just about anything. They do not spill. For the most part they are easy to open but every now and then it can get a little difficult. I would buy more if ever needed.</li>
    <li> These are great. Just don&#x27;t put oil in them. They are great for travel, they don&#x27;t leak. Thank you .</li>
    <li> I used these for traveling purposes, and put shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, face wash, and makeup foundation into them. Everything but the foundation worked pretty well. However, the foundation got a super weird texture to it and lost its liquid consistency, instead turning into something gooey. I would recommend these be used for anything but makeup.</li>
    <li> Love these containers.  The lid unscrews completely from the base for filling, but the mating part of the thread can also be separated from the silicon so you can clean everything.  They are super flexible so they work great for thicker liquids like conditioner or hand cream.  I also have an astringent in one of the smaller ones and haven&#x27;t had any problems with leaking there either.  These look like they can hold any type of liquid you put in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the material they use is a &#x27;shiny&#x27; silicon so it is a little sticky and attracts fuzz easily.  I also wish they sold the smaller sizes separately.  The 1 and 2 oz containers were what originally caught my eye.  All in all a great buy!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it looked like the seal would work well and not leak on an airplane.  My contact solution leaked out of the medium size bottle..  Also, I put &amp;#34; Moroccan Oil&amp;#34; hair product in one of the small bottles and it actually changed the consistency of the oil.  It seemed to absorb into the wall of the bottle and I ended up with a very thick gooey unusable mess.  These are going in the trash.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that works well. I gave it 4 stars because the plastic is a little flimsy and it can be hard to put the cap on and keep it on. I will continue to use and I would recommend, but I would warn you about the caps!</li>
    <li> These are my favorite travel containers and I have tried a lot of them.  They are easy to fill, easy to use all the product that is in them,  and then easy to clean for reuse with another product.  I also like that you can stand them on either end. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with leaking,  but I also have never used them with oil.  I have used them on about 4 trips in the past 12 months without a problem.</li>
    <li> I love these silicone travel containers. So much easier to get all of your product out. I put 4 stars because I thought these were the flat ones, however the silicone part of these is a triangular shape, which makes them a little less convenient to pack... but all the same. I do like the silicone over the hard plastic to put shampoo, moisturizer, hand lotions, shave gel or cream... it&#x27;s brilliant.</li>
    <li> I LOVE you being able to squeeze every last bit of my lotion out of these containers. They are light weight and easy to use. However, their triangle shape makes them a bit more difficult to pack compactly in a baggy for your 3-1-1 ease.</li>
    <li> Work great for putting in our shower so the younger ones know how much to use, saves some money on shower products.</li>
    <li> Perfect for traveling. Wide mouth enables them to easily be refilled.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these containers for my lotion, and think they&#x27;d work REALLY well for creams/shampoo/conditioner/hair gel. I saw other reviews that discouraged using them for liquids...that might very well be. But for lotion...they&#x27;re great (and SO affordable)! I keep one in my car, and in the cold temperature, the &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; is still malleable. Other plastic containers would be brittle or crack. It&#x27;s also easy to squeeze more of the remainder of the contents out than in other types of containers.</li>
    <li> These are the best silicone containers for traveling. They do not open or spill in transit.  Small enough to carry on a plane.</li>
    <li> These were perfect for my trip - I had no problems whatsoever going through security.  The lids are very snug and when you take off the tops, the opening is nice and large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since used these to keep my own homemade lotion (whipped coconut oil w/vitamin E) in - the silicone is so nice and &amp;#34;Squishy&amp;#34; it makes getting anything out very easy.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love these things. I travel a lot for work, so you can wash and reuse them. They are durable and wonderful l love the different sizes. You should try then for yourself.</li>
    <li> These are fun to use and the different colors helps organize soaps/ shampoos. Their triangular shape helps them fit in small cornered showers.</li>
    <li> caps dont stay on, could be an issue when transporting liquid...</li>
    <li> These are amazing for my application. I bought several sets just to make sure I&#x27;d always have this exact set in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make my own deodorant. My husband uses more for each application so he gets the largest size, I use the middle size for my daily use and then we use the smallest size forx travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just the right amount of product comes out the hole by squeezing the silicone sides.  The shape of the bottle makes it easy to hold.  Best of all we can get all the product out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I twist off the flip-top lid and use a really small soon to scoop refills of deodorant into the bottle through the generous sized hole in the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect!</li>
    <li> i debated spending $10 on travel containers, but after reading the reviews I took a chance...these are made of silicon and you can squeeze every drop from them. I just purchased a 2nd set, they also come with 3 extra stickers to label.</li>
    <li> I really liked these. They were convenient, easy to clean, easy to load, and convenient to use. They pack well. The colors and labels are very useful.</li>
