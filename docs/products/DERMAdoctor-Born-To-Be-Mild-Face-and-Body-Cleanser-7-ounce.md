### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t felt this great about my face in years.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>I am now proud to say that this product has been everything I could have hoped for and more.  </li>
      <li>I use this on Mondays and Fridays and my skin looks healthy and really good.</li>
      <li>Excellent product for sensitive skin types.</li>
      <li>It seemed to make the rest of my skin better, but it didn&#x27;t improve what I bought it for.</li>
      <li>This worked better than the prescription gel my doctor</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>However, none of these ever cleared up my face for more than a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I know others have commented on the smell, but I didn&#x27;t find the smell overwhelming</li>
      <li>I just love it.</li>
      <li>I love this cleanser because it calms my skin while thoroghly cleansing and removing make-up.</li>
      <li>truly helps and without causing any irritation { as so many products I&#x27;de tried before had].</li>
      <li>I have struggled with acne for many years.  </li>
      <li>I think it is more for eczema and rashes.  </li>
      <li>Diet wise I don&#x27;t eat as much greasy food anymore.</li>
      <li>Most \\&quot;mild\\&quot; cleansers don&#x27;t seem to clean anything, but this one works -- and also helps get rid of the flakiness caused by the prescription gels.</li>
      <li>I use this face wash twice a day using the DERMAdoctor Born to be Mild face wash, and the itching and eczema-like flaking are mostly gone.</li>
      <li>and ive swithed to Tom&#x27;s fluoride free toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I was so excited about this purchase because everyone raved about this product.</li>
      <li>Not drying, washes off clean, and I think it keeps some nasties from taking root in my skin.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend following up with a mild exfoliant to get rid of any residual flakes/skin and finishing with a good quality oil-free moisturizer (I just use a light coat of pure aloe vera with vitamin E).    </li>
      <li>He said that all I could do was use fragrance-free baby shampoo to do daily lid scrubs, and warm compresses, and since I was already taking fish oil supplements he said that was all I could do.</li>
      <li>I tried this product first to treat mild seborrhoeic dermatitis and had hoped to see results and then also try DERMAdoctor Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27; Medicated Acne Cleanser.</li>
      <li>I stopped using fluoride right when I found this product</li>
      <li>Use this for a few days and you will see acne and flaking get better and better.  </li>
      <li>first time I used it, I put it all over my face and splashed it off.  </li>
      <li>There are so many acne products out there that one would think it is the only skin problem that exists, and therefore, it is often challenging to find remedies for other conditions.  </li>
      <li>And it actually treats in addition to being a very mild cleanser.</li>
      <li>skin is now healthier looking and free of allergy related blemishes and redness.</li>
      <li>My wife says she will buy my as much as this as I need.</li>
      <li>Let me start by saying I&#x27;m not paid by amazon or dermadoctor and this is a real review.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Little bit stinky (but not really awful).</li>
      <li>my face looks normal again and I no longer have to answer those pesky \\&quot;What happened to your face\\&quot; questions.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin any softer, more supple or healthier-looking than if I had washed it with plain water.  </li>
      <li>has started to clear!  </li>
      <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve seen specifically formulated for facial skin that includes it.</li>
      <li>Im not saying this product alone is keeping my face at bay it could be a combo of this product, completely eliminating toothpastes with fluorides, and my diet.</li>
      <li>After much research and fruitless trips to dermatologists who offered no solution to my chronic problems, I came across ads in various magazines for the DERMAdoctor line and checked out the website.  </li>
      <li>recall when my kids were young</li>
      <li>Wow.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised to have an immediate reduction in redness, oosing and itching.</li>
      <li>This product is milky and soft on the skin, but it did not help the redness of my rosacea, which is why I bought it.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>This has a very soft fluffy lather that leaves skin soft and clean.  </li>
      <li>But since I haven&#x27;t had success I wont be trying any of their other products.</li>
      <li>First of all, let me start by saying ive been to a TON of dermatologist and have spent tons of money on lotions, creams, shampoos etc</li>
      <li>To make a long story short, this product is definitely keeping my once flaky, red, dry skin really healthy now.</li>
      <li>Apparently some of it got into my eyes and stung them.  </li>
      <li>I went back to the old standby over-the-counter products.  </li>
      <li>Im 27 year old hispanic male by the way.</li>
      <li>so most things I try just make the situation worse.  </li>
      <li>well worth the cost, if it rids me of the problem I dealt with for the last few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Though not thrilled with the $24 price tag, I decided to give Born to Be Mild a try.  </li>
      <li>I have allergies and skin conditions resulting from this and have tried cortizone and other products for relief but little else has helped until I tried &#x27;Derma Doctor-Born to be Mild&#x27;.</li>

<li> I had a little bit of stinging as I was experiencing an active breakout, but it really did work.  </li>

<li> Also, be very careful to not get the DERMAdoctor face wash in your eyes -- it buuuuurns for a long time if you</li>

<li> Texture a little odd.  </li>

<li> After just a few days of using it, the tightness, oiliness and redness on my face  all but disappeared  and the flakiness has reduced by about 90%.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It does have a very slight odor to it but</li>

<li> I use it when I&#x27;m taking a shower and apply a small portion to my face and hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> This is one of my very few five-star reviews.</li>

<li> This thing lasts forever if you use it on your face and up into your hairline &amp; behind your ears a few times a week.</li>

<li> I cant believe I found this product on some random forum and decided to give it a chance</li>

    <li> DO NOT GET HIS IN YOUR EYES!!! I have gotten in my eyes twice and thought I would go blind or die from the pain both times. It is excruciating. This product is milky and soft on the skin, but it did not help the redness of my rosacea, which is why I bought it. It seemed to make the rest of my skin better, but it didn&#x27;t improve what I bought it for. So maybe it will work for you. Neat label art.</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis by a dermatologist a few years ago when I noticed that my face was getting small, painful red scaly patches on my face (predominantly around my nose, between my eyebrows and along my hairline) for over 7 years.  I have tried multiple products to help alleviate the problem, to include: desonide cream, various other prescription creams and ointments, and various brands of facial soaps like neutrogena and cetaphil.  However, none of these ever cleared up my face for more than a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I went scouring Amazon for other products to try and read a few reviews of this product on Amazon, and was cautiously optimistic that this could be a solution.  I am now proud to say that this product has been everything I could have hoped for and more.  My face has cleared up after only using the product for only one week.  I have now been using it for two months and I only use it two-three times a week as a form of preventive maintenance.  I use it in combination with another product called Dermazinc.  It is a pyrithione zinc  cream that I use on my face as well.  It was not cheap to buy in combination, but well worth the cost, if it rids me of the problem I dealt with for the last few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my face looks normal again and I no longer have to answer those pesky \\&quot;What happened to your face\\&quot; questions. :)</li>
    <li> I have acne and rosacea and use several topical prescription agents (Retin-A, Tazorac, Finacea Gel). I love this cleanser because it calms my skin while thoroghly cleansing and removing make-up. Most \\&quot;mild\\&quot; cleansers don&#x27;t seem to clean anything, but this one works -- and also helps get rid of the flakiness caused by the prescription gels. I just love it.</li>
    <li> I thought I was suffering from acne this past year and to no avail all the acne products in the world were not solving my problems.  I started doing some research and realized I may have Seb Derm.  This cleared up the bumps I had like nothing else!  I use it twice a week with a dandruff shampoo and my skin has started to clear!  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the smell and consistency it feels almost glue like (to me) however if it works it works!</li>
    <li> I have struggled with acne for many years.  No matter what I tried, the acne would not heal and would stick around for months.  I also started getting bad flaking along with the acne.  I have sensitive skin so most things I try just make the situation worse.  After doing some research I realized that some acne is caused by yeast.  If you have yeast acne, it will not respond at all to regular acne treatments.  Yeast also causes skin flaking and itching.  The active ingredient in this product deals specifically with removing the yeast fungus off your skin.  This product works!  This has a very soft fluffy lather that leaves skin soft and clean.  Use this for a few days and you will see acne and flaking get better and better.  Like I said, if you can&#x27;t figure out why your acne doesn&#x27;t heal, this could definitely be the answer for you.</li>
    <li> There is barely enough to use as a body cleanser. I don&#x27;t like this product at all: left a residue, smelled, and didnt help at all. I went back to the same stuff I can get for a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> Most expensive body wash yet does not do anything that it was advertised it does. Stopped using it after two weeks since ineffective ineffective</li>
    <li> There are so many acne products out there that one would think it is the only skin problem that exists, and therefore, it is often challenging to find remedies for other conditions.  Case in point: I have everything EXCEPT acne - eczema, psoriasis, redness, flaky/oily skin, and the worst of the bunch, seborrheic dermatitis on my face.  My dermatitis is both painful and embarassing. It feels like I have a constant sunburn and I am constantly slathering on hydrocortisone to cover the dandruff-like flaky patches on my eyebrows, nose, forehead and chin.      After much research and fruitless trips to dermatologists who offered no solution to my chronic problems, I came across ads in various magazines for the DERMAdoctor line and checked out the website.  Though not thrilled with the $24 price tag, I decided to give Born to Be Mild a try.  After just a few days of using it, the tightness, oiliness and redness on my face  all but disappeared  and the flakiness has reduced by about 90%.  Now I just use it once or twice a week to keep the flakiness under control.    The cons?  The cost (as mentioned above), the smell (smells like an unpleasant mix of swimming pool water and old pennies) and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t go beyond basic utility.  It serves its purposes [to reduce the dermatitis symptoms] but it stops there.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin any softer, more supple or healthier-looking than if I had washed it with plain water.  I highly recommend following up with a mild exfoliant to get rid of any residual flakes/skin and finishing with a good quality oil-free moisturizer (I just use a light coat of pure aloe vera with vitamin E).    Overall, I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This has a compound called pyrithione zinc which has been recommended off label for Rosacea.  This has been floating around by word of mouth, blogs and websites for awhile. This is the first product I&#x27;ve seen specifically formulated for facial skin that includes it. I was surprised to have an immediate reduction in redness, oosing and itching. Wow.  I had a little bit of stinging as I was experiencing an active breakout, but it really did work.  Little bit stinky (but not really awful). Texture a little odd.  But hey....it works. And it actually treats in addition to being a very mild cleanser. After 20+ years of suffering from Rosacea, I&#x27;ll tolerate almost anything if it improves my skin and helps it heal.</li>
    <li> Received the product promptly from the seller. The cleanser is a little irritating, however. If it gets in my nose, throat, or eyes it burns pretty badly.</li>
    <li> this product cleared up the red splotches on my face within days. i have had no recurrence of tinea versicolor since i started using it.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this purchase because everyone raved about this product. However, after using it for about a month and half as directed, I have not seen any improvement; very disappointed. I tried this product first to treat mild seborrhoeic dermatitis and had hoped to see results and then also try DERMAdoctor Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27; Medicated Acne Cleanser. But since I haven&#x27;t had success I wont be trying any of their other products.</li>
    <li> This face wash cleared up my blepharitis with itchy, flaking eyelids, which it turns out was seborrheic dermatitis. My eye doctor said that nothing could be done for the blepharitis. He said that all I could do was use fragrance-free baby shampoo to do daily lid scrubs, and warm compresses, and since I was already taking fish oil supplements he said that was all I could do. A friend of mine recommended taking flaxseed oil by mouth, which helped some. Taking 2-4 teaspoons per day of a refrigerated oil blend (I like Barlean&#x27;s Omega Swirl) helped with the meibomian gland dysfunction and eye dryness, but I still had eczema-like patches on my eyelids. I was sick of being unable to wear makeup, as well as the swelling and itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I read about seborrheic dermatitis and that some people are allergic to the yeast that is naturally present on our skin, called malassezia. Ingredients like pyrithione zinc (the active ingredient in this medicated face wash) will kill the yeast and relieve the symptoms of seb derm. I use this face wash twice a day using the DERMAdoctor Born to be Mild face wash, and the itching and eczema-like flaking are mostly gone. It is weird, but I sometimes still get flare-ups of flaky eczema-like patches in my eyebrows, and on my earlobes and chin, so when that occurs I use a Q-tip to apply butenafine cream (Lotrimin Ultra). Be careful to not use butenafine cream on your eyelids or around your eyes. Also, be very careful to not get the DERMAdoctor face wash in your eyes -- it buuuuurns for a long time if you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line for me is that this DERMAdoctor face wash is pricey, but the tube lasts me several months even with twice-daily use. I also use a pyrithione zinc shampoo (Head &amp; Shoulders) as an added precaution.</li>
    <li> Second tube. This thing lasts forever if you use it on your face and up into your hairline &amp; behind your ears a few times a week. Not drying, washes off clean, and I think it keeps some nasties from taking root in my skin. You only need a tiny bit.</li>
    <li> This worked better than the prescription gel my doctor ordered.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a very slight odor to it but its nothing really.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I put it all over my face and splashed it off.  Apparently some of it got into my eyes and stung them.  So I suggest if you use it on your face dont let it get into your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recall when my kids were young I used zinc oxide for their diaper rashes.  Once I used that, they never had another rash again.  I believe this was from the zinc.  This product also contains zinc and I think thats why it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it works quite well.</li>
    <li> I have allergies and skin conditions resulting from this and have tried cortizone and other products for relief but little else has helped until I tried &#x27;Derma Doctor-Born to be Mild&#x27;. I use it when I&#x27;m taking a shower and apply a small portion to my face and hair.&lt;br /&gt;I rub it on my skin until it laters like a shampoo then I rinse it off.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is now healthier looking and free of allergy related blemishes and redness. I use a small portion every day when I take a shower.&lt;br /&gt;This product definitely helped my skin condition.</li>
    <li> I bought it to help my acne, but it didn&#x27;t work.  I think it is more for eczema and rashes.  It didn&#x27;t hurt my skin though and would probably work for other skin conditions besides mine.</li>
    <li> I imagine this product works for some, and I know the brand is well respected, but I was not happy with my lack of results.  The product burns even after rinsing, although it didn&#x27;t seem to add to my redness.  I used it daily for two weeks before I finally had to admit defeat---my dermatitis was actually WORSE.  I went back to the old standby over-the-counter products.  I know others have commented on the smell, but I didn&#x27;t find the smell overwhelming and it didn&#x27;t linger after washing.  It just wasn&#x27;t the product for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for sensitive skin types.</li>
    <li> I still buy this every time I run out.&lt;br /&gt;This truly helps and without causing any irritation { as so many products I&#x27;de tried before had].</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I&#x27;m not paid by amazon or dermadoctor and this is a real review. Ive suffered from seb derm (face and scalp) for 3 years now. Im 27 year old hispanic male by the way. First of all, let me start by saying ive been to a TON of dermatologist and have spent tons of money on lotions, creams, shampoos etc and NOTHING has worked for me besides a cortisone shot. Literally nothing has worked. The sides of my nose were always red and dry and few spots in my beard. I cant believe I found this product on some random forum and decided to give it a chance and I cant believe it has worked. The redness around my nose and in my beard was eliminated. I use this on Mondays and Fridays and my skin looks healthy and really good. Any one that has seb derm on the face knows what redness im referring to. The bottle may seem small but compared to how I use it im guessing it will last me about 3 months. Im not saying this product alone is keeping my face at bay it could be a combo of this product, completely eliminating toothpastes with fluorides, and my diet. I recently found a study that said people with seb derm could be allergic to fluoride. I stopped using fluoride right when I found this product and ive swithed to Tom&#x27;s fluoride free toothpaste. Diet wise I don&#x27;t eat as much greasy food anymore. To make a long story short, this product is definitely keeping my once flaky, red, dry skin really healthy now. I haven&#x27;t felt this great about my face in years. Just in time for my marriage and wedding photo&#x27;s too. My wife says she will buy my as much as this as I need.</li>
