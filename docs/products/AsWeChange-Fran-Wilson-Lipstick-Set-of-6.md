      <li>These lipsticks are great if you want a large range.</li>
      <li>I am giving this product 2 stars because the colors are much more lighter than they are displayed in the picture and because the quality is not as great as projected (See my attatched picture below for the real colors).</li>

      <li>chap stick forget it and get this because it is better than chap stick</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
      <li>I love all the colors and the way it feels on my lips.</li>
      <li>These are her favorite lipstick colors.  </li>
      <li>Really wish they looked like the picture!!!!</li>
      <li>The lipstick goes on very smoothly and more importantly, it keeps your lips moist.  </li>
      <li>Also they have a mild nice scent.  </li>
      <li>Besides nice colors (there was only one color in this set I can&#x27;t wear), the lipstick feels very nice on your lips...</li>
      <li>Too many light colors in this.</li>
      <li>the lipsticks are fine</li>
      <li>Nice product and shipping was fast and secure.</li>
      <li>It would be great if they were offered for sale individually.</li>
      <li>These colors are fabulous.  </li>
      <li>I looked high and low for this set because I had gotten them before 10 years ago and remember that they are wonderful!</li>
      <li>Overall, very pleased : )</li>
      <li>I would have rated them higher had the colors worked better for me.</li>
      <li>Been a while since using these that i originally purchased from QVC, but have always wanted to find them again.</li>
      <li>They are still smooth, creamy and glide on as easily as the first day</li>
      <li>I feel I should buy a make-up bag or something to put them in to complete the gift and make it nice...</li>
      <li>Every shade won&#x27;t work for you but this set is a real bargain for the quality and usefulness of most of the shades.</li>
      <li>I was expecting them to be bold browns</li>
      <li>The texture is silky and there is no unpleasant perfumed smell or taste.</li>
      <li>Too much on the light brownish pinks side for me.</li>
      <li>They really glide on and feel so smooth.</li>
      <li>I have been able to use every color, they last, and they go on so smoothly.</li>
      <li>They just didn&#x27;t look or feel right.</li>
      <li>Worth buying this classic collection of Fran Wilson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend!!</li>
      <li>The colors on my monitor are pretty neutral, browns, etc.  </li>
      <li>I like the combination of having a more sheer gloss in some colors, and a creamy lip color in some of the others.</li>
      <li>The colors were pretty and creamy, but didn&#x27;t stay on at all.</li>
      <li>They come on somewhat like a gloss, only with more pigment and texture.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>So if you need further evaluation of this product, be sure you are a fan of the Loreal branded lipstick</li>
      <li>Some top quality lipsticks I have purchased dry out before I have had them a year.  </li>
      <li>Goes on very smooth but be careful on the amount of pressure used while applying.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
      <li>especially nearly nude is my fav.</li>
      <li>I really like Fran Wilson lipstick&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>The colors are very glossy-like and they have a shimer/sparkle tone.</li>
      <li>I really like this brand.  </li>
      <li>Fast Service.</li>
      <li>I had no problem with delivery, it was really fast.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anywho, if your preference is that bold vibrant look OR if you like that &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; texture, do not waste your time.</li>
      <li>I particularly like the colors- very neutral and seem to change to match your complexion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First of all, I am very light skinned so for lipstick colors to be lighter than they actually are in the display swatch is actually always a plus for me.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend buying this brand as a go-to lipstick.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this set.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Extremely high quality at an affordable price.</li>
      <li>The lighter colors that I normally don&#x27;t wear, I use under a darker lip gloss and find that it does the job for me.  </li>
      <li>Very soft and creamy.  </li>
      <li>There were all too dark or too light for me.</li>
      <li>Due to the rich moisturizers, lipstick is softer than others and will break off.</li>
      <li>addition, this particular lipstick set is very similar to a particular collection sold by Loreal cosmetics.</li>
      <li>the green turns a rich, true pink on me.</li>
      <li>, I started to buy my make up on Amazon and so far I am not desappointed.</li>
      <li>The lipsticks were a much lower quality than the prior Fran Wilson lip color I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
      <li>In fact, if you are looking for a quality set of lipsticks for your 14-16 year old daughter, this will do.</li>
      <li>it stays on well and makes your lips soft.</li>
      <li>Super moisturizing and long lasting.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Too many light colors in this. I was hoping for at least one brown cream color and also a coral.</li>
    <li> I have been looking to purchase Fran Wilson lipstick for some time.  I used to buy this product on QVC.  It is the best lipstick I have ever used.  The lipstick goes on very smoothly and more importantly, it keeps your lips moist.  The lips do not get all dry and cracked.  The lipstick stays put for a long time and feels like chapstick - a real blessing in the winter.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Super moisturizing and long lasting. Extremely high quality at an affordable price. Highly recommend buying this brand as a go-to lipstick.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the colors of the lipsticks.  There were all too dark or too light for me. I am a redhead with fair skin.  They might be better for a person with darker or olive skin.  I did like the texture of the lipsticks. They feel great going on.  I would have rated them higher had the colors worked better for me.</li>
    <li> I like the color, I love this lipstick</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Fran Wilson lipsticks on QVC.  I love the product.  They are creamy and long lasting.  The only negative in buying a collection is that some of the colors are not ones you would normally wear.  The lighter colors that I normally don&#x27;t wear, I use under a darker lip gloss and find that it does the job for me.  The Fran Wilson products are a terrific buy ...... you can&#x27;t do better at five times the price.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for my Mom...the lipsticks are fine I&#x27;m sure and I know my Mom likes them, however my biggest problem with this item is the presentation.      The description says its a gift set, but when you get it, the 6 lipsticks are wrapped in plain ole tissue paper and tape with a big sticker that says \\&quot;Fran Wilson\\&quot; on the front.    It doesn&#x27;t look very nice to give just \\&quot;as is\\&quot; in my opinion...I feel I should buy a make-up bag or something to put them in to complete the gift and make it nice...so that&#x27;s why it gets only 3 stars.    The lipsticks in a simple box would have been enough for me, but just not tissue paper with loose lipsticks inside!!!</li>
    <li> Besides nice colors (there was only one color in this set I can&#x27;t wear), the lipstick feels very nice on your lips...it stays on well and makes your lips soft. It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;cake-up\\&quot; either like some of them can. Overall, very pleased : )</li>
    <li> Not the deep earth tone creme colors I hoped for. Too much on the light brownish pinks side for me. Great lip moisturizer though. Color doesn&#x27;t last like his Mood lipsticks. I eat the 1 color used(rarely) off in minutes! :( Goes on very smooth but be careful on the amount of pressure used while applying. I also suggest not to expose entire lipstick when applying. Due to the rich moisturizers, lipstick is softer than others and will break off. They are alot softer than the Mood Matchers. At least to me.</li>
    <li> These colors are fabulous.  Every one wearable no throw aways!  Very smooth texture and moisturizing to the lips. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> These lipsticks are great if you want a large range. Three of them are well suited to medium-dark skin tones, and three to fair-medium. I am giving three of them to a friend with lighter skin then mine, but I could also probably use Ice, Kiss, and Spicy mixed with another product. Nude, Cherish, and Champagne are well suited to my brown skin.&lt;br /&gt;Note: none of these lipsticks are matte. They come on somewhat like a gloss, only with more pigment and texture.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this set.</li>
    <li> The colors on my monitor are pretty neutral, browns, etc.  Colors in person except for 2 of the lipsticks are pink  and coral which are shades I can totally not wear.  The 2 I do like are very creamy and long lasting.  Really wish they looked like the picture!!!!</li>
    <li> Great item. Fast Service. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love all the colors and the way it feels on my lips. Fast delivery. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I really like Fran Wilson lipstick&#x27;s.  This brand doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my lips. Good color saturation, but moist att he same time.</li>
    <li> Very soft and creamy.  I used 3 of the 6 colors and gave the others away to friends.  All in all  it was a good value.</li>
    <li> I love Fran Wilson lipsticks.  The only problem is I only use two of the colors and give away the other 6.  It would be great if they were offered for sale individually.</li>
    <li> These were not the colors I ordered nor did they stay on long at all.  They just didn&#x27;t look or feel right.</li>
    <li> I have been able to use every color, they last, and they go on so smoothly. I like the combination of having a more sheer gloss in some colors, and a creamy lip color in some of the others. A nice collection.</li>
    <li> Been a while since using these that i originally purchased from QVC, but have always wanted to find them again. imagine my disappointment: the gels are not as buttery &amp; the creams are gritty. while their staying power is ok, fran wilson moodmatcher blows them all away. stays on for many hours. the only drawback is limited ultimate color selection. the green turns a rich, true pink on me. love it.</li>
    <li> I really like this brand.  It is creamy and last.  I would buy more.  I can&#x27;t seem to find tham anywhere else.</li>
    <li> I had no problem with delivery, it was really fast. The lipsticks were a much lower quality than the prior Fran Wilson lip color I&#x27;ve bought. The colors were pretty and creamy, but didn&#x27;t stay on at all. I&#x27;ve sent them back.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick. The colors were just what i was looking for. They really glide on and feel so smooth.</li>
    <li> I was really happy with the color and the texture of the lip stick!</li>
    <li> Every shade won&#x27;t work for you but this set is a real bargain for the quality and usefulness of most of the shades. I&#x27;ve just purchased my second set. Some frost some not.</li>
    <li> I looked high and low for this set because I had gotten them before 10 years ago and remember that they are wonderful! I love the colors and I love the way they make my lips feel. they are great for your lips because of the shea butter and if they continue to sell this product I will purchase from them again...Will probably purchase some for my daughter in the near future because she keeps using mine! I you need chap stick forget it and get this because it is better than chap stick and it has beautiful colors...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;T.O.</li>
    <li> Mom loved it. Perfect color set for her.</li>
    <li> i bought this product couple of week ago and i like each one of them... especially nearly nude is my fav. Worth buying this classic collection of Fran Wilson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend!!</li>
    <li> I am giving this product 2 stars because the colors are much more lighter than they are displayed in the picture and because the quality is not as great as projected (See my attatched picture below for the real colors). As you can see in the picture, one of the lipsticks also came a little scratched as if a fingernail scraped a little of the color off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I am very light skinned so for lipstick colors to be lighter than they actually are in the display swatch is actually always a plus for me. However, this is not the situation with these lipstick colors. I was expecting them to be bold browns but once applied on the lips, they are actually faded and shiny. Two of the 6 lipsticks are actually in shades of pink and I mean barbie pink once applied on. The other 4 are basically nudes that look almost identical to each other. (Again, refer to the picture I have attatched)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While these lipsticks stay moist on your lips, they are not vibrant at all. The colors are very glossy-like and they have a shimer/sparkle tone. So if your preference is that shimmery lipgloss look OR if you are looking for a lipstick that carries that &amp;#34;smooth chapstick&amp;#34; texture, then this set is for you. In fact, if you are looking for a quality set of lipsticks for your 14-16 year old daughter, this will do. I say this perhaps because I am a little biased, but I think any type of lipcream that has that shimery shine is meant for teenagers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, this particular lipstick set is very similar to a particular collection sold by Loreal cosmetics. I am not sure what exact collection is, but I have one lipstick and the sticker reads &amp;#34;Peach Fuzz&amp;#34; (#417 and says LOREAL COLOUR RICHE on the sticker) So if you need further evaluation of this product, be sure you are a fan of the Loreal branded lipstick I just described because the shimmery chapstick tone is what both these lipsticks carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywho, if your preference is that bold vibrant look OR if you like that &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; texture, do not waste your time. This is definitely not your style.4; texture, do not waste your time. This is definitely not your style.</li>
    <li> I bought this set from QVC at least 5 years ago.  I still have a few left.  They are still smooth, creamy and glide on as easily as the first day I tried them.  Also they have a mild nice scent.  Some top quality lipsticks I have purchased dry out before I have had them a year.  I would highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  The colors are great too. . .</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my mom.  These are her favorite lipstick colors.  She loves them.  The lipsticks are nice and creamy and the colors are just like in the photo.</li>
    <li> wonderful, creamy ,lasting lip color- wears well and seems like a winter treatment for your lips. I particularly like the colors- very neutral and seem to change to match your complexion.</li>
    <li> I am happy with these lipsticks as I can use them all, all the colors are nice. I cannot find lipsticks of this good quality here for this price in stores, I started to buy my make up on Amazon and so far I am not desappointed. Nice product and shipping was fast and secure.</li>
    <li> After paying a ridiculous amount for one lipstick at my local drugstore, only to find it to be unflattering once I had it on my lips,&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try to find a value package. Well these lipsticks exceed my expectations. All of the shades are fairly neutral. I feel they can be worn by just about everyone unless you are truly looking for the bright reds. The texture is silky and there is no unpleasant perfumed smell or taste. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love these colors and how moist they are.  This is my second set.  I use all the time.</li>
