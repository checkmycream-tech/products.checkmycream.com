      <li>This product is amazing never would of though it would work so good on my skin, it leaves my skin hydrated and soft just love it.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price!!</li>
      <li>Great product for cleaning my sensitive skin without abrasion.  </li>
      <li>I think it is ideal for any age, but I would especially recommend for acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>My complextion is great and as suggested by the customer rep, I then use the remains on either the back of my hands or my chest.</li>
      <li>I now think that all I needed was effective cleansing that was not irritating.</li>
      <li>Skin no longer crusty, but smooth and youthful.  </li>
      <li>The product is legit Philosophy in original packaging.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin moisterised and clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not an aroma that stays with you all day, just enough to make you feel pleasant while you&#x27;re washing up.&lt;br</li>
      <li>really love how gentle it is on the eyes.</li>
      <li>It is a smooth creamy facial wash that does not foam or sudz up very much, and that is a good thing.</li>
      <li>It dissolves makeup and leaves my skin fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>I love this cleanser, and was able to get the 32 ounce bottle for next to nothing during a philosophy sale.</li>
      <li>My face is very sensitive to regular soap and this soap cleanses the skin beautifully.</li>
      <li>Many products are chemical laden and just too harsh and can further irritate, this stuff is perfect and calming to skin.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is on the strong side but doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on Philosophy&#x27;s mailing list and got a 40 percent off coupon with free shipping; 15 percent coupons on the real price for this side - $52 - are all over the Internet.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor, it smells similar to Hope In a Jar to me and is easy to wash off my face.</li>
      <li>I love the product it is the only thing that takes off my Tarte foundation and eye makeup  without me having to scrub and scrub and my face feels  very smooth and soft afterwards plus the price here at amazon beats the shop at home channel!</li>
      <li>It keeps my whole face so clean and supple.</li>
      <li>This cleanser is VERY GENTLE and does not irritate my eyes even if it gets to my eyes (should still try to avoid eye contact with the cleanser).</li>
      <li>Just what I needed - the jumbo, pump version of my favorite cleanser that only shows up in stores twice a year.</li>
      <li>but the product started smelling funny after a while.</li>
      <li>The pump did not work and at first use I noticed the difference in consistency.  </li>
      <li>The smell is very clean, it is non drying, and this is just about the only product that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
      <li>but luckily i had a new pump from a Philosophy lotion i Purchased before so no worries</li>
      <li>So soft, clean, and not overly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Though it does not completely remove all of the mascara, it comes the closest of the many products that I have tried.</li>
      <li>rosacea gone, sun damage improving daily, acne scaring disappearing, fine lines around my mouth almost gone, age spots reduced, pores reduced.  </li>
      <li>I have very oily skin</li>
      <li>I was looking for a nice moisturizing facial cleanser that would remove all of my makeup, especially the mascara.</li>
      <li>Removes makeup easily and gently, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
      <li>There are several things I love about the product.&lt;br /&gt;The smell: Not a cloying or overpowering scent, but a light and slightly herbal smell.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I love this cleanser and certainly plan to buy the same thing when it finally runs out.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been 3 weeks now and my skin feels softer and looks a little better.</li>
      <li>I wash my face with this product first then deep cleanse with another facial cleanser to clean and exfoliate, etc.</li>
      <li>For my skin personally, this might be as close as it gets to an easy facial cleanser.</li>
      <li>This will last me another year for certain.</li>
      <li>No annoying little clumps on my face.</li>
      <li>No clue how long the bottle will last, but very satisfied with how little it takes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am 50 years old.  </li>
      <li>I really like this facial cleanser.</li>
      <li>It does not provide the same effects as the real product and leaves my skin greasy.  </li>
      <li>Purity is so simple to use, just a little in your hands in the shower or over a sink or in a wash cloth and it clean as so gently.</li>
      <li>No tight feeling after cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
      <li>Purity is so gentle and does not over dry the skin.</li>
      <li>Since winter really dries out my skin, I was worried about trying a new cleanser, but it worked out and I can keep using it year round.</li>
      <li>And although pricey, really does last a long time, since you only need about a quarter amount for your face and neck.</li>

    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years and it has been veery good to my skin.  My face is very sensitive to regular soap and this soap cleanses the skin beautifully.</li>
    <li> I love the product it is the only thing that takes off my Tarte foundation and eye makeup  without me having to scrub and scrub and my face feels  very smooth and soft afterwards plus the price here at amazon beats the shop at home channel!</li>
    <li> I adore this cleanser. Once trying it in a smaller size, I had to upgrade to the big size because I never want to be without it. Purity is so simple to use, just a little in your hands in the shower or over a sink or in a wash cloth and it clean as so gently. It is a smooth creamy facial wash that does not foam or sudz up very much, and that is a good thing. It has a lovely scent. I have not had to buy an eye makeup remover since using this (I&#x27;ve been using for two years) because this stuff will remove it so effectively, there is also no burning in the eyes while washing, even when I have my contacts in. The best part of this cleanser is that I do not get blemishes anymore. I have always had stubborn acne and have tried every product and system on the market and nothing worked. I now think that all I needed was effective cleansing that was not irritating. Purity is so gentle and does not over dry the skin. I think it is ideal for any age, but I would especially recommend for acne prone skin. Many products are chemical laden and just too harsh and can further irritate, this stuff is perfect and calming to skin. Please give it a try! I am never going back.</li>
    <li> love, love, love.  I have very oily skin and this has worked well and has not made my skin dry or tight. I love that it removes makeup as well.  no need for a toner.</li>
    <li> Amazing! It&#x27;s an excellent cleanser that does not burn your eyes and completely removes makeup! I love it, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> I really like this facial cleanser. I was looking for a nice moisturizing facial cleanser that would remove all of my makeup, especially the mascara. Though it does not completely remove all of the mascara, it comes the closest of the many products that I have tried.</li>
    <li> I used to break out sporadically, but face washes with salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide are WAY too harsh for me (I have painfully sensitive skin.) This stuff is AMAZING! It makes my skin look great, smells wonderful, and seems to last forever. An 8 oz bottle lasted me about a year; a little bit goes a long way with this stuff. I&#x27;m 25, which seems like the stage in between acne and anti-aging regimens. This is perfect for my skin and I can see myself using it for a long time. My one beauty splurge!! Definitely worth the price!!</li>
    <li> Since I found it on Amazon I know like have to go to the mall to buy it and pay almost double for it..plus this stuff works great on my skin</li>
    <li> I absoutely love this product. I use to use cetaphil and wanted to try something different. I love this it get all my make up off and it smells very good as well. The texture is creamy and it feels great on your skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best product you will ever buy for a face cleanser. I would give it 10 stars if I could! I am a philosophy girl through and through. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Period. No, it&#x27;s not cheap, but you get what you pay for. The smell is very clean, it is non drying, and this is just about the only product that doesn&#x27;t make me break out. It&#x27;s also great at removing makeup. I&#x27;d rather spend a few extra dollars for this than use an inferior product. I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed - the jumbo, pump version of my favorite cleanser that only shows up in stores twice a year. This will last me another year for certain. The product is legit Philosophy in original packaging. If you use Purity daily like me, you might want this.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser, and was able to get the 32 ounce bottle for next to nothing during a philosophy sale. It is shelf stable, so even if you don&#x27;t use it quickly, it&#x27;s ok. I use this with my clarasonic mia and I love how it makes my skin look and feel! So soft, clean, and not overly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love how gentle it is on the eyes. I wash my eyelids regularly, and this never stings or burns my eyes. It keeps my whole face so clean and supple. And although pricey, really does last a long time, since you only need about a quarter amount for your face and neck. It does have a scent while washing, not bad, just a little odd. It doesn&#x27;t linger after rinsing, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 32 ounce bottle is a great deal and nice to have around wihtout worrying about running out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always tempted by other skin cleaners, but no matter what, I always work my way back to Purity Made Simple. it&#x27;s simply the best skin cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used. It dissolves makeup and leaves my skin fresh and clean. it also works great with the Clairsonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Amazon, but sometimes the prices are just crazy. I&#x27;m on Philosophy&#x27;s mailing list and got a 40 percent off coupon with free shipping; 15 percent coupons on the real price for this side - $52 - are all over the Internet. Check out their website before you buy.</li>
    <li> Best face wash ever! Removes makeup easily and gently, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. No breakouts! On a side note is great for cleaning cuts/scrapes because it somehow reduces stinging from water.</li>
    <li> Great product for cleaning my sensitive skin without abrasion.  However, mine did not come with a pump lid.  I did have one of my own that I used.</li>
    <li> The Best Facial Wash Ever !&lt;br /&gt;It cleanses your face so good your face feels amazingly clean &amp; refreshed after you use it . Its expensive but Really worth it&lt;br /&gt;My pump came broken but luckily i had a new pump from a Philosophy lotion i Purchased before so no worries&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> I have used Purity for years.  It&#x27;s excellent and there is no need for a toner when using Purity.</li>
    <li> My hubby bought this cleanser for me as a surprise, and I was a little skeptical, but not for long. There are several things I love about the product.&lt;br /&gt;The smell: Not a cloying or overpowering scent, but a light and slightly herbal smell. I can definitely smell the rosemary. It&#x27;s not an aroma that stays with you all day, just enough to make you feel pleasant while you&#x27;re washing up.&lt;br /&gt;Mascara: This product washes off all my mascara. No annoying little clumps on my face. No residue on my lashes. Somehow I think it just dissolves it all away.&lt;br /&gt;Thorough: If I used toner after washing my face, my cotton pad still showed some soil from my face. Not with this cleanser. It gets all traces of makeup and stuff off my face.&lt;br /&gt;Concentrated: I just use a little and it does the trick. I&#x27;ve used it daily for about 3 months now and it&#x27;s not even 1/4 empty. No clue how long the bottle will last, but very satisfied with how little it takes.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this cleanser and certainly plan to buy the same thing when it finally runs out.</li>
    <li> Great merchandise, quick shipping, outstanding transaction.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin moisterised and clean. No tight feeling after cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and washes makeup off well.&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using this product for years now, and consistantly good.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Been using it for Years.</li>
    <li> My favorite part of my shower...it&#x27;s like a mini-facial every day. Love the scent!</li>
    <li> this is wonderful stuff!  My complextion is great and as suggested by the customer rep, I then use the remains on either the back of my hands or my chest.</li>
    <li> Have been using this in combination with Miracle Worker and Hope in A Jar for the past month.  I am 50 years old.  I was suffering from rosacea when I start using this, as well as sun damage all over my face from hours of playing sports in the sun.  Within a week of using these products.....  rosacea gone, sun damage improving daily, acne scaring disappearing, fine lines around my mouth almost gone, age spots reduced, pores reduced.  Skin no longer crusty, but smooth and youthful.  Amazing.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love love love purity</li>
    <li> Best price and my wife loves it.  Happy wife / Happy life!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 8 years now and I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> The bottle I got was huge!  Costco size. This will take me months to finish but maybe in a sorority house it can be used up in a few weeks.  The fragrance is on the strong side but doesn&#x27;t bother me too much. Pehaps I need to rub it into my face more but I still catch some leftover makeup on my face even after rinsing off  Edit:  I didn&#x27;t see an expiration date  but the product started smelling funny after a while. I ended up throwing it all away.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing never would of though it would work so good on my skin, it leaves my skin hydrated and soft just love it.</li>
    <li> Finally added this to my skin care routine. Since I already use 2 other Philosophy moisture products &amp;#34;Hope in a Jar&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Eye Hope&amp;#34; I figured I would give this facial cleanser a shot. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks now and my skin feels softer and looks a little better. Since winter really dries out my skin, I was worried about trying a new cleanser, but it worked out and I can keep using it year round. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor, it smells similar to Hope In a Jar to me and is easy to wash off my face. For my skin personally, this might be as close as it gets to an easy facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> Love it. Small amount removes makeup and leaves skin soft. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> It removes your heavy makeup including any eye makeup. I used to use cleansing wipes and they would irritate my skin from rubbing my face to remove makeup. This cleanser is VERY GENTLE and does not irritate my eyes even if it gets to my eyes (should still try to avoid eye contact with the cleanser). I wash my face with this product first then deep cleanse with another facial cleanser to clean and exfoliate, etc. I love this product and will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I have used Purity countless times before which I purchased on QVC or at Sephora and this pales in comparison.  The pump did not work and at first use I noticed the difference in consistency.  It does not provide the same effects as the real product and leaves my skin greasy.  This seller should definitely be taken off of Amazon Prime and credit should be applied.  Not to be trusted!  Complete waste of $$$.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser for all types of skin, you don&#x27;t need any thing else. This removes even water proof makeup. Your shin never feel tight after use.</li>
    <li> Best face wash ever! I keep this in the shower and it lasts for months!</li>
