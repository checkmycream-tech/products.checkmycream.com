### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>So, I&#x27;m happy!!</li>
      <li>Works excellent!</li>
      <li>Great value and price too!</li>
      <li>Best I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
      <li>Great price, I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
      <li>The best hairspray ever for my baby-soft, fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Fructis is a good brand, I use a lot of Fructis products.  </li>
      <li>A good price and a good product.</li>
      <li>A very clean and bouncy hold.</li>
      <li>This spray smells good but doesn&#x27;t hold very well.  </li>
      <li>It has a strong hold as it states.  </li>
      <li>All Garnier has done is make it smell nice and put a pretty package on it.</li>
      <li>I have light, medium length hair</li>
      <li>If you just want a light hold, then this will do.  </li>
      <li>great hold and staying power, just a few sprays and your good for the whole day.</li>
      <li>I wanted a soft hold spray that wouldn&#x27;t make my hair feel sticky and this fits the bill nicely.</li>
      <li>I think it is priced right and shipped quickly and packaged fine.  </li>
      <li>The hold isn&#x27;t the strongest, but other than that it is a good product.</li>
      <li>just right.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for many years now and my hair is still just as healthy as it was before I started using it everyday.</li>
      <li>This one does pretty well, although I&#x27;ll probably keep looking once I finish up this bottle.</li>
      <li>This smells good, and doesn&#x27;t leave the hair stiff and crunchy.</li>
      <li>This hairspray works fine enough.  </li>
      <li>It seems really &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>But it didn&#x27;t really help my hair.</li>
      <li>It is the smell that is a little strong but not bad.  </li>
      <li>I like Garnier products, and I needed a new hairspray.</li>
      <li>I was VERY SURPRISED that this fairly inexpensive drug store brand of hairspray worked as well, and even better than some, very expensive high-end hair care products!  </li>
      <li>But it works so well that my hair will stay in place all day, looks natural, shiny, even if i run my fingers through it during the day.  </li>

<li> I have very thick, coarse, wavy hair cut short to the wave.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that because it is non-aerosol, sometimes it comes out in a stream instead of a mist or a spray.  </li>
<li> It works for about half a day but not all day.</li>
<li> Might seem odd that a man uses a styling spritz, but I&#x27;ve found gels to be too flaky (literally).</li>
<li> I wanted control without heavy, stiff, wet looking hair and this does the trick.  </li>
<li> I would prefer it  had something in it to give me a little less frizz.</li>
<li> This product controls my wavy slightly spiky hair well and can even take some rain without running down my face like hair gel, all without inducing dandruff!</li>
<li> This is too expensive for what you are getting.</li>
<li> Sprays in a very weird way and ends up covering my face no matter what I do.</li>
<li> I had a very difficult time trying to work with this product.</li>
<li> It feels terrible on my hair.</li>

    <li> The best hairspray ever for my baby-soft, fine hair.  A little goes a long way and it lasts for the day.</li>
    <li> Leaves a white residue but still works like a charm</li>
    <li> This spray smells good but doesn&#x27;t hold very well.  If you just want a light hold, then this will do.  But it didn&#x27;t really help my hair.</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;ve tried them all. Light-feeling yet packs a lot of staying power! Great value and price too!</li>

    <li> I wanted control without heavy, stiff, wet looking hair and this does the trick.  my hair does not feel yucky the end of the day and it isn&#x27;t left feeling dry, oily or otherwise.  A good price and a good product.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair in place all day.  But not on rainy days.</li>
    <li> I had a very difficult time trying to work with this product. It holds like cement or glue. It feels terrible on my hair. I have very thick, coarse, wavy hair cut short to the wave. One hair cutter called it &amp;#34;iron nails&amp;#34;. I am going back to Swarztkopf products. I also may try some of the other recommended products. This is too expensive for what you are getting. You could buy White Rain or Suave and do just as well. All Garnier has done is make it smell nice and put a pretty package on it. The pump gets clogged up too. It might work for others but did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I found the spray nozzle to plug up when left on counter, have to rinse it out to make it work each time. Also spray residue is sticky and won&#x27;t brush out of my hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and have always had trouble finding a hairspray that will hold my hair in place without leaving it stiff and dry.  This is a miracle hair spray.  It feels really strange when you spray it on.  It seems really &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;.  But it works so well that my hair will stay in place all day, looks natural, shiny, even if i run my fingers through it during the day.  I never want to be without this spray!</li>
    <li> It works for about half a day but not all day. I would prefer it  had something in it to give me a little less frizz.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a hair spray, for crying out loud..I only use it for my Beard ( and you should see my beard) because I ride a motorcycle. It works for I need it for.. So, I&#x27;m happy!! Fructis is a good brand, I use a lot of Fructis products.  Remember, It&#x27;s JUST HAIR SPRAY folks!!</li>
    <li> Works excellent! That&#x27;s my opinion though, and (like anything else), it takes practice to make this work well to style your hair just right. I have light, medium length hair (hair strands ranging between 3 to 5 inches) and it holds it in place very solidly. I would not know if this holds true for curly hair or very thick hair though. I have been using this product for many years now and my hair is still just as healthy as it was before I started using it everyday.</li>
    <li> If you want extreme hold this one will do it.</li>
    <li> This hairspray works fine enough.  It is the smell that is a little strong but not bad.  Once it is sprayed, you cannot smell it any longer.  Only when you are spraying it.  It has a strong hold as it states.  I think it is priced right and shipped quickly and packaged fine.  Just do not over-use it because if you have light-colored hair, it leaves the hair darker.  I have got it figured out now and have no problems with the hairspray.</li>
    <li> I was VERY SURPRISED that this fairly inexpensive drug store brand of hairspray worked as well, and even better than some, very expensive high-end hair care products!  I spray my hair in the morning, and it is still held in place when I get off work in the evening!  My only complaint is that because it is non-aerosol, sometimes it comes out in a stream instead of a mist or a spray.  I have to remember to rinse off the hole which helps that problem.  Other than that, I recommend this product!</li>
