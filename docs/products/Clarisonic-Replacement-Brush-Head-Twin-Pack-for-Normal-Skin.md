<li> Amazon are not selling fake things...</li>
<li> I&#x27;m so upset that I received a fake clarisonic brush head!</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
<li> and it scrubbed the crap out of my face to the point where parts of it were bleeding.</li>
<li> They are fake!!!!</li>

    <li> They will improve your skin. I love my Clarisonic. No, it&#x27;s not some miracle product that will knock 50 years off your age (I wish), but it does clean my skin better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before. That&#x27;s the best praise I can give it. I&#x27;ve knocked a star off because, at the end of the day, these things are pretty expensive for what they are.</li>
    <li> There are many different items out there like this but I have found this item to be one of the best. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It looked weired. Don&#x27;t know why but it didn&#x27;t look like the original ones....&lt;br /&gt;Hope Amazon are not selling fake things...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We returned it right after first glance.</li>

    <li> Exactly what the description says and got here quickly. I love my Clarisonic. I&#x27;m so glad I found a place to purchase affordable replacement brush heads</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Factory sealed.</li>
    <li> Looked on several sites for price and information before buying these from Amazon. Amazon had the best price and clearest description of the product (there are several different brush styles for different skin types with different prices) and as so often happens, the awesome free shipping put this deal over the top.</li>
    <li> Love using my Clairsonic and the rush heads are soft and durable, too.  Will always look to Amazon for great prices.</li>
    <li> I love for Clarisonic brush. I feel like it really makes a difference in keeping my skin clean and exfoliated. These are the brand name replacement heads and for a great price (at the time I bought them they were $11 for the 2 pack). I paid ~$25 for two heads before.</li>
    <li> Yes!  Get this.  Pores will be happy, complexion will be brighter, skin will be exfoliated and so.....you will be happy too!</li>
    <li> These fit and work as advertized.  We use it in the shower and it is nice to replace the heads every once in a while.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic.  I love my Mia and have recommended it many times as I will these little brush heads</li>
    <li> I like the deep pore ones better, but these are good, too. I switch back and forth between the two. Bottom line, I LOVE my Clairsonic!  So anything they make for it I automatically like.</li>
    <li> Hair texture is very soft, and my face is very clean</li>
    <li> These brushes go with the Clarisonic. They are gentle while still doing a great job on exfoliating and cleaning your skin. I really like them. Wish they had these on Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save deal.</li>
    <li> These are the real deal at a super good price!!  I have use these and the sensitive skin ones and prefer these much more.  They came in their original box brand new.  I can&#x27;t believe how good the price is.  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Seemed to be the Clarisonic brand replacement brushes for a better price than you can get in the store.  They didn&#x27;t have the sensitive skin ones so I had to get the normal skin ones, which are a little harsh for my skin.</li>
    <li> these are much better then the generic</li>
    <li> I purchased these items as a replacement for what I currently use.  The Clarisonic works good and the brushes clean your facial pores very well.  I do put them in the dishwasher to clean them and this works.</li>
    <li> The brushes were great.  I like all the clarisonic products but this was the best price found on amazon.  It came right away and works great.  It really improves skin tone and dark spots.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so upset that I received a fake clarisonic brush head! I immediately noticed it was different and I still gave it a try and it scrubbed the crap out of my face to the point where parts of it were bleeding. I didn&#x27;t do anything different.. I didn&#x27;t press too hard or anything. I&#x27;ve been using my clarisonic for YEARS and I have never had this happen before. I should have known better than to order these because the price was so low! They are fake!!!! I cannot believe Amazon would allow this seller to do this.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit and works great. Love em.  Shipped fast</li>
    <li> The two pack of Clarisonic Normal brush heads arrived quickly and was a great bargin.  I easily saved over $15.00 for this two pack.  Every other site was much more.  Will Definately reorder when needed! :-)</li>
    <li> I have been using my Clarisonic cleanser on my face and neck for 6 months.  I LOVE this gismo!  I use the normal brush in the PM and the sensitive brush in the AM.  My skin is soooooooooooo clean and soft.  I  am in my 60s and still have problems with acne, but , since starting this system I have noticed fewer breakouts and my skin just looks younger and feels so soft.  I recommend this for everyone, I&#x27;ve already purchased one for my daughter as a gift and she loves it too.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and they work very well, sometimes I prefer the sensitive or acne cleansing brushes, but this one works perfect for me as an every day brush head.</li>
    <li> I live by my clarisonic skin brush and these brush heads are authentic. Same price as in store, but with Prime and free shipping, I order them on amazon to save a trip to the store.</li>
    <li> I hope they are the right ones but I bought brush heads for face cleaning last year and she loved them.  Thought I would get her some new ones.</li>
    <li> It was much softer than the &amp;#34;normal skin&amp;#34; brush. I wonder if this is a knock-off because it doesn&#x27;t feel like the ones i&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Clarisonic Mia for almost two years,  I have ordered replacement brushes several times and have been pleased with the brushes.  For the most part, I have always gotten Clarisonic brand brushes in a box.  I prefer the brush head for normal skin.  The brush head for gentle skin is too &#x27;light&#x27; duty, for me.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my Clarisonic cleaner. They fit and work well. Highly recommend. Nice that there are 2 to a package</li>
    <li> My sister gave me a Mia for my birthday and I can honestly cay that I could feel the clean difference the first time I used it.  I try to replace the heads every 3 months but sometimes I go a little longer...whoops.</li>
    <li> This two pack was a great price. It shipped fast and they work great! My face is smooth and wrinkles diminished.</li>
    <li> These are great, generic ruined my Clarisonic Brush..</li>
    <li> They do the job perfectly; good for my skin.  Easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;Plan to purchase again when these wear out.</li>
    <li> fits the clarisonic and works perfectly</li>
    <li> the normal one is very good ,it&#x27;s cheaper than others .and easy to use.i will buy it again.thanks so much.</li>
    <li> Still a lot of money for a brush as was the unit itself. Should last a life time for the price</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product because it helps to keep your skin healthy and glowing. It removes all residual makeup, helps to clean out pores and allows your products to be absorb more efficiently. I tend to use this brush on my neck and hands,</li>
    <li> Counterfeit replacement brushes, it is obvious as soon as you take them out of the unsealed box. Returned them right away! I will spend the extra $4 and buy them from Ulta.</li>
    <li> My husband and I use the Clarisonic Plus brush and these replacements online are original (not knockoffs)... excellent buy and product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Clarisonic for almost 2 years. I replace the brush heads with these every 3 months. I&#x27;m a man that takes really good care of his 50 year old skin. This normal brush is just right for me even though I have somewhat sensitive skin. Great product.</li>
