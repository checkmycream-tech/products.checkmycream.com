      <li>It is beautiful with clear crystals and well made.  </li>
      <li>It has a vintage old money feel which is going to be great for my formal.</li>
      <li>I bought the clear crystal sliver pelted headband tiara for my Great Gatsby theme formal.</li>
      <li>but you can bend to tiara to fit your head (not my favorite feature</li>
      <li>The price was great because a lot of wedding boutiques and shops want to charge $100 or more for a similar product.  </li>
      <li>but it is easily bendable</li>
      <li>Was beautiful in my blonde hair for my wedding.</li>
      <li>You can give yourself more height with veil/ hairstyle, but be aware of the fit. :)</li>
      <li>It was more beautiful than expected!</li>
      <li>This one was perfect size and not too heavy.  </li>
      <li>It is beautifull but cheap</li>
      <li>Fit</li>
      <li>This met all expectations, was comfortable</li>
      <li>It is bendable so it will fit the way you want it to.  </li>
      <li>The bling is very eye catching and I am looking forward to pairing this with my dress and bling shoes.</li>
      <li>Arrive even more quickly than expected (a day before the estimated arrival date) and it looks great.</li>
      <li>Price was right!</li>
      <li>The shipping was faster then expected which was great.</li>
      <li>Totally appropriate for a bride or an attendant.  </li>
      <li>The headband was much more ornate and expensive looking than I had thought it would be so it was perfect!</li>
      <li>bought this for my wedding and it looks very pretty</li>
      <li>You probably shouldn&#x27;t try to bend it very much, but it seemed sturdy enough to me, and it looks good with my veil.</li>
      <li>Only thing to think about is that it will fit more like a headband than a tiara.</li>
      <li>Lovely and much more reasonable than purchasing similar items at Bridal Shops.  </li>
      <li>SO pretty.</li>
      <li>I had purchased a similar one at the bridal store for a LOT more money.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>It got ruined, however, this one as a replacement was just as beautiful and was of similar quality, style, and workmanship, just a lot less.  </li>
      <li>Very sparkly and pretty.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty big, but you can mold it to your head and secure it with pins.</li>
      <li>The product is very sturdy &amp; pretty and it arrived so fast, my wedding is in 3 weeks</li>
      <li>It is a beautifully made it looks so much more expensive then it actually is.</li>
      <li>but I was able to bend but be careful don&#x27;t bend too much</li>
      <li>As am twenty three wanted a tiara,but didn&#x27;t want one that would make me look too much like a princess.</li>
      <li>When I put it in my hair, the bottoms (I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;d really call it)</li>
      <li>This tiara was the icing on the cake to my whole wedding attire.  </li>
      <li>It sparkles as much as my diamond ring and is an.easily adjusted type of metal,so can.bend</li>
      <li>but it will work because you can secure it with bobby pins due to the loops at the bottom.)</li>

    <li> I bought the tiara for my daughters prom.  It is beautiful with clear crystals and well made.  I would recommend this product to anyone that needs something like this.</li>
    <li> It looks similar to the picture they have posted. It sparkles a lot, which I love! The quality is good for the price but it is easily bendable so you have to be very careful because I feel like this thing could bend right if half if you barely put pressure. When I put it in my hair, the bottoms (I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;d really call it) but those are really harsh on my head so I&#x27;m going to see if I can find like soft bumpers so that my head isn&#x27;t dying all night on my wedding night.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll post some pics of the head band but they&#x27;re not the best. I&#x27;ll post another picture on my wedding day with my hair which will be Sept. 20th.&lt;br /&gt;***I would buy this any day over the over priced ones they sell at any bridal store***</li>
    <li> Pretty..falls off head</li>
    <li> I love this headband!! It will look great for my wedding. its sparkly and beautiful!!</li>
    <li> looks better in the picture but i think the you need more options fotr the ok ok thas my opinion</li>
    <li> I wore this in a late summer wedding (maid of honor) with a dress that was on the simpler side.  I needed some bling somewhere!  Very nicely crafted headband compared to the chintzy ones I saw at Claire&#x27;s.  Received tons of compliments.  Totally appropriate for a bride or an attendant.  The wedding was outdoors, in a gazebo overlooking the St. Lawrence River and I was kind of going with a Great Gatsby vibe with my jewelry and this headband...was delighted with it!</li>
    <li> Wore it for my wedding!  Comfortable &amp; packaged nicely! It was more beautiful than expected! Price was right! Worked perfectly</li>
    <li> it was big, it was awkward shape.</li>
    <li> Was the perfect accessory to go with my veil. It was so inexpensive and looked very fancy and pictured beautifully!</li>
    <li> This was the perfect accent for my daughter&#x27;s prom dress. It&#x27;s sturdy and not cheaply made at all. Good buy!</li>
    <li> This tiara was the icing on the cake to my whole wedding attire.  It is bendable so it will fit the way you want it to.  Once it was pinned in, I couldn&#x27;t even tell it was there.</li>
    <li> Just received  my headband today it&#x27;s gorgeous! !!I&#x27;m glad I got on amazon  it&#x27;s a little big for me but I was able to bend but be careful don&#x27;t bend too much I don&#x27;t know if it will break but it&#x27;s beautiful! !!</li>
    <li> SO pretty. Came just as pictured, very happy.</li>
    <li> My wife used this Tiara on our wedding, she just loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Is a very good option to choose for garnish your hair for a special date.</li>
    <li> I bought the clear crystal sliver pelted headband tiara for my Great Gatsby theme formal. The shipping was faster then expected which was great. It is a beautifully made it looks so much more expensive then it actually is. It has a vintage old money feel which is going to be great for my formal. Its simple but makes a big statement at the same time. The reason its given a 4/5 stars is because it is a little bit big but you can bend to tiara to fit your head (not my favorite feature but it will work because you can secure it with bobby pins due to the loops at the bottom.) Over all worth the money its beautiful and I can&#x27;t wait to wear it!!</li>
    <li> Order for my daughter&#x27;s quinceanera.  She wanted a small profile tiara.  This one was perfect size and not too heavy.  It looked beautiful.</li>
    <li> I bought this to wear at my wedding and it was beautiful!  The price was great because a lot of wedding boutiques and shops want to charge $100 or more for a similar product.  This met all expectations, was comfortable (I wore it all day), and it was affordable!</li>
    <li> The headband was much more ornate and expensive looking than I had thought it would be so it was perfect!</li>
    <li> I loved this tiara however I didn&#x27;t get a chance to wear it as the hairstyle I had for the wedding just didn&#x27;t look right&lt;br /&gt;with it so I had to return.  I got it for a wedding as mother of the bride.</li>
    <li> The product is very sturdy &amp; pretty and it arrived so fast, my wedding is in 3 weeks and I thought I was going to have to wait!! The panic is over. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for her wedding day.  She absolutely loved it!  I really is beautiful and does not look cheap.  Very sparkly and pretty.  I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Good . Worked out well</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this headband. It was perfect! Goes well with my wedding dress. It wasn&#x27;t too big neither too small.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE&lt;br /&gt;Bought this for my upcoming wedding and i absolutely love it, great product! The price is amazing! Very soft on my head and its adjustable, just be careful handling it, its very gentle. Can&#x27;t wait to wear it...Thank you Venus Jewelry!!</li>
    <li> Was beautiful in my blonde hair for my wedding.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my upcoming wedding and it is absolutely beautiful. It looks very expensive and is well made. The bling is very eye catching and I am looking forward to pairing this with my dress and bling shoes.</li>
    <li> I was quite nervous about purchasing this item for several reasons. I couldn&#x27;t try it on physically,  worried it would break during shipment and what if I didn&#x27;t like it. I went ahead and purchased it, once it arrived I opened the box only to find that it arrived in 1 piece and it was a lot more attractive in person. I tried it on and it fit like a glove and made me look beautiful. I recommend this beautiful tiara to add that special touch to your wedding day!</li>
    <li> bought this for my wedding and it looks very pretty and it fits great...especially i have a big head</li>
    <li> I bought this to wear in my wedding on June. As am twenty three wanted a tiara,but didn&#x27;t want one that would make me look too much like a princess. Hard to do with a romantic,elegant wedding dress that is like a modern medieval style with split front. This tiara is perfect! Arrived and was sooo happy. It sparkles as much as my diamond ring and is an.easily adjusted type of metal,so can.bend it to get the look you want. Can be worn also in front of or a little above like headband too besides on top of head so looks elegant,but not princess like or too flashy. Can be worn on top of head too if you do want the princess or royal look. Plus alot prettier than tiaras saw in wedding dress shop for not even half the price. As on strict budget this was a win win purchase!</li>
    <li> Arrive even more quickly than expected (a day before the estimated arrival date) and it looks great. After reading the other reviews, I was expecting it to be really flimsy, but it&#x27;s not. You probably shouldn&#x27;t try to bend it very much, but it seemed sturdy enough to me, and it looks good with my veil. It&#x27;s easy to see in photos, but not large enough to be distracting. Love it!</li>
    <li> son&#x27;s fiancee wanted this and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful piece and a wonderful price</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE my tiara! It is beautiful and an amazing weight; you can tell it is made out of quality metal. I love how it looks but I especially love when it arrived! It came well before it was estimated to arrive. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone and everyone who is looking for that added touch to feel beautiful on their wedding day!</li>
    <li> Wore this on my wedding day. Absolutely beautiful!</li>
    <li> Ordered this product for my wedding, and it&#x27;s perfect! It&#x27;s pretty big, but you can mold it to your head and secure it with pins. The jewel work looks much more expensive than it is. The product came promptly. Only thing to think about is that it will fit more like a headband than a tiara. You can give yourself more height with veil/ hairstyle, but be aware of the fit. :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautiful!  I wore for my 50th birthday, I have long dark hair and it was just what I wanted.  Just enough glimmer without the cheesiness.</li>
    <li> wonderful headpiece and even better price.  I had purchased a similar one at the bridal store for a LOT more money.  It got ruined, however, this one as a replacement was just as beautiful and was of similar quality, style, and workmanship, just a lot less.  If you are considering this, don&#x27;t hesitate, it was shipped promptly with no problems.</li>
    <li> Lovely and much more reasonable than purchasing similar items at Bridal Shops.  Quality was excellent!</li>
    <li> Picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice! Arrived on schedule . It looked much more expensive than the actual price. Made my daughter look like a princess on her wedding day .</li>
    <li> It is beautifull but cheap made  when i took it out from the package fell apart a piece later when i was checking from where another piece fell,</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very beautiful!! But it is a little big. You can bend it some but it will definitely need to be clipped in with bobby pins or something.</li>
    <li> This is the most beautiful headpiece, it is prettier in person than in the pictures and I can&#x27;t wait to wear it on my wedding day!  It is the PERFECT addition to my dress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> Loved it! I wore it in my hair for my wedding. It was beautiful. It sure&lt;br /&gt;was similar to the $200.00 in the bridal store.</li>
    <li> Ah! This was perfect! Fit well, stayed in place with no problem. Sparkly, looks just like the pic.</li>
