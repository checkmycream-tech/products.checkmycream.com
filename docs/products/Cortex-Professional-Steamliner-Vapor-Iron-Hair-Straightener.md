      <li>This gets pretty close to the scalp, which is great, but be careful you don&#x27;t burn your scalp, neck, or temples when you&#x27;re trying to get close to the skin.</li>
      <li>The only warning I have is that the iron gets really hot, so chose the temperature setting wisely.</li>

      <li>They refused to give me a tank replacement since this iron isn&#x27;t covered by the warranty since I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the $275 price tag on the Cortex website.</li>

      <li>I love this curling iron and considered buying an extra in case</li>
      <li>I first saw it at my hair salon</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s been making my hair really soft and smooth, every time.</li>
      <li>The first time I used the iron</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve burned myself because the tip can get hot</li>
      <li>My mother owned it first</li>
      <li>The next morning the section I straightened with the Cortex was notably shinier and maintained is softness, the ends didn&#x27;t look crisp at all compared to the FHI side.</li>

      <li>I Love this flat iron!!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this flat iron!!</li>
      <li>- so be sure you touch only the ridges on the front top side of the platic on the outside because the underside plate of the tip gets super hot on the outside plastic housing.  </li>
      <li>The fact that the curling iron steams your hair with Moroccan Argan Oil prevents your hair from damage, it gives your hair amazing shine and uses half the time to do your hair.</li>
      <li>Works great on fine thin hair or coarse hair.  </li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t seen my hair this straight since my hair was relaxed 7 years ago.</li>
      <li>Works very well...</li>
      <li>Heats up really fast.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This looks like a great product.  I am returning only because it does not fit into the appliance stand I recently purchased to store these items.</li>
    <li> I love this iron! I have previously owed Chi, Babyliss, and NuMe irons and this outperforms them all. It leaves my hair totally smooth and shiny. My mother owned it first and I tried hers. Last summer, I used her iron to flip my ends after a blow-out. My hair looked so healthy, and the ends had lots of body. At the time, I thought that my blow-out technique or the brush or products had gave me those results, but after months of trying to replicate that look, I realized that it was because of this flat iron. I had been using a Babyliss titanium iron, but the stylist at Ulta told me that the Titanium is too damaging for fine hair, so I immediately stopped using it and ordered this one. This iron offers much more flexibility than any others that I have used. I&#x27;m so glad that I made that purchase.</li>
    <li> love it, great purchase, hair feels soft and smooth.  Great price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron!! I am African American and have hair that falls almost to my waist and is wavy. Normally it takes me 30 minutes to straighten my hair bc my normal flat iron does not get the job done very quickly. I have to keep straightening and straightening. When my beautician first used this iron on my hair it literally took her half the time and I was so amazed. I had to have it!! She reluctantly told me she would purchase one for me from her distributor (bc why would I need her if I had my own, lol) but at the cost of $270. So as she was flat ironing my hair, I caught the name of the iron out of the corner of my eye, went home that day, found it on Amazon for $60 something and received it in the mail a week later. LOL!!! I love how straight my hair gets. I have read that people have had issues with the oil spilling, well one way to stop that is to make sure you have the rubber stopper in place. Its pretty tight so the oil isnt going to spill if its put in properly. Also, no burns on my hair and no funky smell!!! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Works great on my very coarse hair, leaving it smooth and shiny. Could not ask for anything better.</li>
    <li> I Love this flat iron!! I have many top of the line flat irons ghg etc but this one has cut my flat ironing time in half it also leaves my hair healthy feeling &amp; Nice &amp; Shiney as well.</li>
    <li> GREAT GREAT GREAT!  Afro American with natural  hair type 4a 4b and c  has shine and moisture love the oil.</li>
    <li> Everything I wished for...Loveee it. 😘 Woo/Hoo</li>
    <li> I have kinky curly hair and when I decide to straighten it, this flat iron is amazing!!! Love the vapor feature. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I. LOVE. THIS. PRODUCT. Amazing, I have thick type 4C Kinky hair and I haven&#x27;t seen my hair this straight since my hair was relaxed 7 years ago. I straightened it on 375 degrees and high steam using the Chase method, and my hair came out shiny, silky, and soft. I kind of didn&#x27;t know what to with my hair after I finished straightening it lol. My hair typically reverts after about an hour with regular flat ironing or if the weather is really humid and wet, I found the best way to preserve this style to be simply silk wrapping it before bed. I recently used the Beautiful Textures TMS so I have had to do less to preserve the straightened style but I&#x27;m never going back to a regular flat iron again. This is now my staple tool for straightening my hair hands down.</li>
    <li> Love it good for your hair</li>
    <li> The first time I used the iron it was amazing, I only straightened part of my hair with this iron and then the other half with my FHI and there was an obvious difference in feel and texture. The next morning the section I straightened with the Cortex was notably shinier and maintained is softness, the ends didn&#x27;t look crisp at all compared to the FHI side. I was extremely pleased with this iron until I tried to straighten my hair a second time only to find out the oil tank was broken and leaking. I first contacted amazon thinking I could get a replacement, wrong, the only option was the return the iron. Mind you, the iron was still in great working condition, it was just the plastic tank that was problematic. I didn&#x27;t want to return the iron, simply get a new tank so I instead reached out directly to cortex. Their customer service representative was extremely unprofessional, hung up on me at one point, and then called me three times after calling me by the wrong name. They refused to give me a tank replacement since this iron isn&#x27;t covered by the warranty since I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the $275 price tag on the Cortex website. I asked if I could simply purchase a new tank and was told they don&#x27;t sell the tanks alone. So now I&#x27;m stuck with a regular flat iron that can&#x27;t steam argan oil onto my hair as it all just spills out. It was great while it worked, but it quickly stopped working so I can&#x27;t give it the 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> Best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used. Just one pass and the hair is smooth, silky and straight. I love it.</li>
    <li> Love my flat iron.  My hair look the best.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist got this iron at a hair show in Chicago. I fell in love with it when she used it on me. Went on amazon and got it! I like you can turn the infusion on and off. But the infusion makes your hair silky and shiny. Heats up really fast. Very nice cord with a way to wrap it up.</li>
    <li> Works very well...I love it#</li>
    <li> A friend of mine recommended this because they use the same one in their salon.  I&#x27;ve searched for a long time and this is the best straightener I&#x27;ve used.  Swivel cord prevents knots and kinks and makes it easier to handle.  Fabric wrapped cord ensures it will last a long time.  Works great on fine thin hair or coarse hair.  Heats up in under 30-seconds (I&#x27;ve never timed it).  I&#x27;ve burned myself because the tip can get hot - so be sure you touch only the ridges on the front top side of the platic on the outside because the underside plate of the tip gets super hot on the outside plastic housing.  This gets pretty close to the scalp, which is great, but be careful you don&#x27;t burn your scalp, neck, or temples when you&#x27;re trying to get close to the skin.</li>
    <li> This has been the best flat iron I have used. I just have to run it once through the section and the hair will be straightened, perfectly. Also, it&#x27;s been making my hair really soft and smooth, every time. No leakage problems. The chord is heavy duty, so no problems with tangling it up. The only warning I have is that the iron gets really hot, so chose the temperature setting wisely.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and getting it straight can be challenging sometimes. With this straightener, I&#x27;m able to straighten with one pass through the flat iron! I love it!</li>
    <li> The difference with this flatiron is the oil that is released while you straighten your hair.  You can control the amount of oil and steam. With other flatirons my hair would look damaged and frizzy at the ends, but the infused argan oil conditions and softens when you use the steam setting. My hairdresser uses and recommend this and I bought one for my sister in Texas and she loves it too!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Makes your hair so shiny and healthy looking!</li>
    <li> The concept of this iron is pretty cool, but after having 2 irons fail within a year, I am not happy at all with this product. The clear reservoir where the &amp;#34;argan oil&amp;#34; goes has a plastic clip that holds it in place. That clip has broke twice now (in two different units). Also the spring inside has started to rust, turning the liquid a yukky brown color. I sure don&#x27;t want to steam my hair with rust water! I think it is a shame that we have to pay $25 to ship it back to them (now after 2 breaking, paying $50). I returned the second defective iron 3 weeks ago and still waiting on a replacement. Thank God I have a back up iron to get me through.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this straightener.  We were introduced to the product in a mall kiosk on sale for the one time sale price of $250.  I talked her into waiting and within a few days found it here on amazon for the $79.99 sale price.  Her hair is silky smooth.  We have owned it now for a week and we will need to reorder the oil for it about once a month by my calculations.  She has thick hair that is just below her shoulders when straight.  She has naturally curly red hair so we are always skeptical of new straightening products that are marketed well and perform poorly.  We will  definitely stick with this product for years to come.</li>
    <li> Edited to add:  the oil chamber leaks!  I basically don&#x27;t even use the vapour option any more because it&#x27;s so messy.  Thank goodness it works as a regular flat iron, even without the oil.  The plates are super smooth, heats up in seconds, and has many heat settings.  You can turn the vapour also has 3 settings (off, light, heavier).  The reservoir is easy to remove and fill, and there are several cool spots on the iron, which are great for avoiding burning your fingers when curling.  The cord is really cool too... super long, and wrapped in fabric like an expensive extension cord.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this exact curling iron on my hair the last time I had my hair done. The fact that the curling iron steams your hair with Moroccan Argan Oil prevents your hair from damage, it gives your hair amazing shine and uses half the time to do your hair. It uses very little oil each time. I love this curling iron and considered buying an extra in case this one ever breaks. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!</li>
    <li> This tool is very good idea, I ware waiting for my package very excited,  at the 3rd day working it got  very hot, the filter didn&#x27;t support  the heat and broke the holder that is very sensitive.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is AMAZING. I first saw it at my hair salon and they were selling it for $150, but I got it here on Amazon for $55.00. Pretty good deal! Also, the argon oil really gives your hair a good shine, and it smells nice too! My hair is so full of body and is so smooth after I use this. I also love how their are multiple temperature settings that you can choose from. I can definitely tell that this is a professional iron, and I&#x27;m so glad I got it at a good price.</li>
    <li> this flat iron works ok but has never had steam come out. It also makes a dent in your hair if you are not careful where you start. It&#x27;s heavy and tiring to use. I wish I would have saved my box and returned it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and I have SEVERAL flat irons! This one is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE!!!! I can&#x27;t believe how soft and shiny my client&#x27;s hair is after I use it on them! In the process of checking to see if it come in more sizes!</li>
    <li> Really nice product- ergonomic and feels comfortable. Doesn&#x27;t pull and does a nice job of getting bumps out of hair.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron you will ever own!!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent!! The best!! After use it your hair looks great!!! I love this hair steam for sure!</li>
    <li> I love the flat iron. I do wish the plates moved so you can curl your hair too. The oil has turned brown, &amp; has bits floating in it. What&#x27;s that about?</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I have ever owned. WELL WORTH the price. I am African-American with relaxed hair, and this iron straightens out my new growth so smooth that I am able to go months without needing a salon visit! Great buy!</li>
