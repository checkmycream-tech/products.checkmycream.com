      <li>, I smelled my pits at the end of a regular work day (hardware store), and they smelled awesome!  </li>
      <li>Love these products.</li>
      <li>It does it&#x27;s job as a deodorant, but the scent is not my favorite.</li>
      <li>the forest scent is much better.  </li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m almost always able to get through my 7 hour shift on 1 application.</li>
      <li>I love Herban Cowboy products.</li>
      <li>It smells more like deet you&#x27;d spray on yourself to avoid ticks when camping in the woods on a mountainside rather than the mountainside itself.</li>
      <li>on my body, I am more incline to a smooth but not overpowering kind of smell.  </li>
      <li>They  love  it too.</li>
      <li>I want to order more for my family.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Maybe 4-6 hours top before you need to reapply.  </li>
      <li>I used it for maybe 2 weeks at most.</li>
      <li>This  deodorant is fabulous!  </li>
      <li>I love Herban Cowboy deodorant and cologne, but I did not like this fragrance.</li>
      <li>It has a strong woody/pine smell to it that I would register more along the lines of cleaning products.</li>
      <li>This stuff works great, and the fact that it is natural is even better.</li>
      <li>Great All natural product!  </li>
      <li>Love the Herban Cowboy deodorants, great scents last most of the day I do reapply after strenuous activities.</li>
      <li>The other ones made by this company are excellent.</li>
      <li>its true!</li>
      <li>Got three different scents of this deodorant and they smell great, they just don&#x27;t work for more than an hour or two depending on your activity level.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate and goes on easily.</li>
      <li>Good quality last all day unless you go to the gym then put on more, love it .</li>
      <li>I tried the Dusk scent which I enjoyed tremendously.  </li>
      <li>Price could use some work though, $6 for a little 3 ounce stick of deodorant ain&#x27;t the greatest deal in the world, but if it keeps me from getting Alzheimer&#x27;s I&#x27;ll let it slide.</li>
      <li>Smells great (like fresh cut wood) but it does not last for more than a couple of hours.</li>
      <li>smells good, no complaints from the ladies so far.  </li>
      <li>This deodorant smell great but after a full day at work, it didn&#x27;t last 100%.</li>
      <li>I originally tried this for the ingredients.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave marks on clothes, unfortunately on a hot day it&#x27;s mostly given up by afternoon</li>
      <li>Cowboy &amp;#34;Mountain&amp;#34; has a unique smell.</li>
      <li>When I first started buying Herban Cowboy deodorants, they did a much better job of keeping unwanted scents away.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure &amp;#34;mountain&amp;#34; is the best description though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>basically if you have a clean diet</li>
      <li>Smells good, but doesn&#x27;t last, you will need to reapply.</li>
      <li>Otherwise a great deodorant certainly a cut above the rest.</li>
      <li>This scent is my second favorite after &amp;#34;Forest&amp;#34; but it is a favorite of mine.</li>
      <li>And, most importantly, make sure your underarms are dry before you put on deodorant</li>
      <li>Luckily, on those flights when it&#x27;s nap time, I can rest my head on either shoulder with confidence...</li>
      <li>if you want to use a natural sweat and odor protection, the is the right one for men!!!</li>
      <li>As far as all natural deodorants go, this is by far the best we&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>The smell is masculine but not too strong!  </li>
      <li>scent reminds me of the pinon fires you smell walking through a quaint New Mexico town in the winter, so top ratings on that.</li>
      <li>Do not think wilderness, but more like the inside of a new cabinet at the furniture store.</li>
      <li>me, this has been the most effective deodorant I have tried, providing upwards of 8-10 hours of damp and smell protection for an average day.</li>
      <li>I rated it 5 stars because I&#x27;m comparing it to other all natural brands and of the many we&#x27;ve tried, this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>clean - Doesn&#x27;t seem to stain or get on clothing very much  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>There are some better self-apply options on amazon or you can make your own for much less.</li>
      <li>This is the only natural deodorant my husband will happily use.</li>
      <li>We have tried all kinds of more natural deodorants and nothing</li>
      <li>Goes on a bit wet but has a good scent.  </li>
      <li>I think it is one of the better natural deodorants I have tried.</li>
      <li>One of the better natural deodorants I&#x27;ve used.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells like the mountains!</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t like the smell at all. The other ones made by this company are excellent.</li>
    <li> fast shipping, works great! if you want to use a natural sweat and odor protection, the is the right one for men!!!</li>
    <li> This particular scent smells something like baby powder to me, which isn&#x27;t something that I enjoy smelling like all the time. It does it&#x27;s job as a deodorant, but the scent is not my favorite.</li>
    <li> Great All natural product!  It lasts all day and is the 1st deodorant that does not give me a rash after a few days of wearing it.  The smell is masculine but not too strong!  Can&#x27;t say enough about how much I like this deodorant!</li>
    <li> I personally like the fresh woody scent of this deodorant and prefer it to the &amp;#34;dusk&amp;#34; scent. I&#x27;m not sure &amp;#34;mountain&amp;#34; is the best description though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly wanted to add a note to the reviews to say that I noticed over the last year that the ingredients had changed. When I first started buying Herban Cowboy deodorants, they did a much better job of keeping unwanted scents away. I thought at the time that this might have been because they all contained silver. The deodorants no longer contain silver and, no, they don&#x27;t seem to do quite the same job of keeping unwanted armpit stink away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I should add that while armpit smell &amp;#34;happens,&amp;#34; the quality of your deodorant is not the only factor. In my experience, the #1 cause of armpit smell is actually...deodorant + fabric. What happens is that the deodorant plus bacteria from your pits gets stuck in the fabric of your shirt. Ordinary laundering does not usually get rid of the smell. If you use scented detergent, the scent may well be disguising the smell. However, if you take a deep sniff of your shirt in the right spot, you&#x27;ll probably discover familiar stink. It&#x27;ll smell distant, but just imagine what that smell does once it&#x27;s been given some warmth and just a little bit of moisture! I&#x27;ve only found two ways to deal with this problem: 1) turn the offending shirts inside out and soak the armpit area in hydrogen peroxide overnight. 2) turn the offending shirts inside out and soak the armpit area or the entire shirt in white vinegar overnight. Then launder as usual .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other cause of smelly underarms is bad underarm hygiene. Make sure you wash your armpit well in the shower. I sometimes wash with a very small amount of chlorhexidine if ordinary soap won&#x27;t work. And, most importantly, make sure your underarms are dry before you put on deodorant and before you cover them with clothes. We all know that bacteria likes warm, moist places...</li>
    <li> This deodorant smell great but after a full day at work, it didn&#x27;t last 100%. I work in an office and don&#x27;t move around a lot nor have bad BO so I was a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> i like the smell, its nice spicy! i tried it on before yoga class and a student said i smelled nice.. geexz i didnt have the heart to tell her it was my deod! well it still isnt an antiperspirant so it will still have a bit of moistness there  but it is nice for a short term little while. basically if you have a clean diet you aint gonna smell too badly! so i used to smell worse long ways back when i ate garbage fast food. you eat french fries, pizzas, ect, and your armpits will smell like fries or pizza oh yeh i guess if you want to attract a guy thats good youll have no problems. its true! and gross.</li>
    <li> Smelt isnt as good as the other decent they have thats popular , I cant  think of the name  but I will buy the other next time</li>
    <li> We have tried so many natural deodorants for my husband, and most of them have disappointed us. This one was quite nice.  It keeps him smelling good and has some protection agains perspiring.  Definitely blocks out oder better than some others that we have tried.</li>
    <li> Seems to work at least as well as any aluminum free deodorant (non anti-perspirant). It doesn&#x27;t irritate and goes on easily.</li>
    <li> Love this brand and this smells so good on my husband!! I use the LOVE smell, and he uses this or the dusk one and they both smell wonderful on him!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week.  pros: - Feels natural, smells natural - Easy to wash/clean - Doesn&#x27;t seem to stain or get on clothing very much  cons: - Less effective than popular products - doesn&#x27;t seem to last all day - Smell is a little weird on this &#x27;Mountain&#x27; variety, I will try a different one next time, but I fear they will all have this thick essential oils scent   UPDATE:  I stopped using it and went back to Old Spice. Didn&#x27;t even make it through the first stick. It just didn&#x27;t work that well, and smelled weird too (though it has very little lasting scent after you apply it). It&#x27;s a shame because I would much rather using something 100% natural.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work after a few hours. Tried for a week, and stank up the workplace and home.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. No nasty chemicals and works brilliantly.</li>
    <li> Love the Herban Cowboy deodorants, great scents last most of the day I do reapply after strenuous activities. I have tries Jasons deodorant in the past and it was so waxy my pits couldn&#x27;t breath and actually broke out, was also constantly smelling myself not the deodorant. This is the best non aluminum deodorant I have found.</li>
    <li> I chose this since it&#x27;s aluminum free and smells great. It doesn&#x27;t leave marks on clothes, unfortunately on a hot day it&#x27;s mostly given up by afternoon and I can begin to smell myself over its scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So keeping this for cool days, and going to try something else for daily use.</li>
    <li> Very good. Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I love Herban Cowboy deodorant and cologne, but I did not like this fragrance. I absolutely love the green (Forest) and grey (musk) ones.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant that I have found that works and does not irritate my underarms.  I have tried other brands that say hypoallergenic but they irritated me.  It works great for me.</li>
    <li> Smells great and I smell good all day wearing this product. I like that it is natural and the price is right</li>
    <li> It truly doesn&#x27;t last the whole day.  Maybe 4-6 hours top before you need to reapply.  There are some better self-apply options on amazon or you can make your own for much less.</li>
    <li> Got three different scents of this deodorant and they smell great, they just don&#x27;t work for more than an hour or two depending on your activity level. Unfortunately so for these are a lot healther for you than most UAD&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> When it comes to using deodorant, cologne, etc. on my body, I am more incline to a smooth but not overpowering kind of smell.  This Mountain Herban Cowboy deodorant has some herbs extract scent which I found to be a little strong for me.</li>
    <li> Trying to find a natural deodorant free of aluminum (and PG, which is still common in many natural body products) that actually works is very hard. Each person&#x27;s individual body chemistry will determine how a particular brand and scent will work (or not, in many cases).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this has been the most effective deodorant I have tried, providing upwards of 8-10 hours of damp and smell protection for an average day. I haven&#x27;t had to experience the hot summer yet, but expect that higher outside temps with decrease that effectiveness. Most other brands I have tried either last a short time or make me smell real funky by the end of the day. Not Natural Grooming Mountain. So if this one doesn&#x27;t work for you, unfortunately your may just have to spend the money and try several other brands to find one that does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as cost, it is pretty on par with most other natural deodorant products, when on sale. Otherwise, it is a little bit pricier. But for me, the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain propylene glycol is a huge bonus and worth the extra buck or two, on top of the fact that it actually works for me. Personally, I&#x27;m willing to spend an extra $2-3 every 4 months (that&#x27;s how long the stick lasts for me) to stay dry and not get stinky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent reminds me of the pinon fires you smell walking through a quaint New Mexico town in the winter, so top ratings on that. Musky and woody without being overpowering, and not an overly masculine scent so it could be worn by both men and women.</li>
    <li> Usually, I don&#x27;t think this would matter, but I should say that this smells quite odd... Not particularly bad, but hmm, I do not think I would buy again.. I think that&#x27;s definitely up to your preferences though!</li>
    <li> Works nice but I much prefer the Dusk scent.</li>
    <li> smells good, no complaints from the ladies so far.  Price could use some work though, $6 for a little 3 ounce stick of deodorant ain&#x27;t the greatest deal in the world, but if it keeps me from getting Alzheimer&#x27;s I&#x27;ll let it slide.</li>
    <li> I love Herban Cowboy products. This scent is my second favorite after &amp;#34;Forest&amp;#34; but it is a favorite of mine. I no longer use regular deodorants because of these products. They work well for odor and wetness on my body. I am a fan.</li>
    <li> I think it is one of the better natural deodorants I have tried.</li>
    <li> As far as all natural deodorants go, this is by far the best we&#x27;ve found. My husband and I both use them. There is a tradeoff as others have mentioned when switching to all natural, but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal when you&#x27;re avoiding all the crap in regular store kind. When I go to work I keep a little bottle of witch hazel or apple cider vinegar and some cotton balls in my purse. If I notice I&#x27;m getting a little funky I just go clean up real quick and put more deodorant on. This scent (Mountain) smells like incense to me. I don&#x27;t know the names of each scent of incense but probably nag champa or something similar that&#x27;s common to incense. I&#x27;m a server and it&#x27;s hot in our place in the summer, I&#x27;m almost always able to get through my 7 hour shift on 1 application. It&#x27;s equally priced to similar brands that I&#x27;ve tried also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy this with the expectations that it&#x27;ll work the same as drug store brands. I rated it 5 stars because I&#x27;m comparing it to other all natural brands and of the many we&#x27;ve tried, this is by far the best. I would absolutely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like the direction this company is going by using all natural ingredients. However, deodorant products are things that rarely change and once you get accustomed with a specific smell...it is something you stick to. The Herban Cowboy is a deodorant that is more in tune with the categories of deodorants that are associated with a line (think Axe, True Religion, A&amp;F, and other designer brands). These are not usually your daily use products and are more for a specific occasion. That being said, their usefulness plays out in the span of only a few hours at best.  Perfect for going out to a party, but horrible for a day at the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herban Cowboy &amp;#34;Mountain&amp;#34; has a unique smell. Do not think wilderness, but more like the inside of a new cabinet at the furniture store. It has a strong woody/pine smell to it that I would register more along the lines of cleaning products. If it were to be liquified and placed in a Pine-Sol bottle, I would chalk it up to the company trying something new. After about an hour of use it mellows out to what I can only describe as a fruity potpourri smell...with pine needles. It is slightly awkward but honestly it keeps your curiosity busy as long as you use it very lightly.</li>
    <li> Great brand, great product but horrible scent! I know scent is a highly subjective thing to rate but I did not care for the Mountain scent at all. The Forest scent smells waaaaaaaaaaaaaay better and keeps you smelling fresh all day long!</li>
    <li> Love these products. Mountain is a fairly good scent but Forrest is my favorite. Otherwise a great deodorant certainly a cut above the rest.</li>
    <li> Smells great (like fresh cut wood) but it does not last for more than a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> Smells good, but doesn&#x27;t last, you will need to reapply.</li>
    <li> No aluminum decent price but this particular one to smells like patchouli oil. It&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> Wonderful aroma, cruelty-free underarm deodorant!   This deodorant has the exact scent of Pinon, which is found in northern New Mexico Forests.   Hard to believe the developers of this cologne were are to mimic Pinon&#x27;s exact scent!</li>
    <li> tried multiple non-toxic deodorants but so far this brand I prefer</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this for about 6 months now.  We have tried all kinds of more natural deodorants and nothing has worked but this.  He has a fairly physical outdoor job and doesn&#x27;t have any issues while using this.  I just ordered the unscented version for me!</li>
    <li> Product went on well, good scent and is a good value.  Unfortunately it did not last the entire day for me.  I work indoors/outdoors and my body seems to require something stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll recommend to someone who works in the office.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, however it just doesn&#x27;t last for me for a whole day. If I&#x27;m just working at my desk job I give it about 6 hour coverage. If I&#x27;m doing anything active then it&#x27;s reduced to about 2-4 hour coverage. So, overall it&#x27;s ok, the price isn&#x27;t as expensive as many other natural deodorants, so it&#x27;s economical, but I&#x27;ll keep looking around for something that is longer lasting.</li>
    <li> I became annoyed after finding out that Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials deodorant is not as &#x27;natural&#x27; as it lead on to be so I tried this one out.  Unlike the Jason deodorant my wife bought previously which A) stays sticky under your arms all day and B) just doesn&#x27;t work for more than 2 hours, the Herban Cowboy deodorant dries pretty quickly, smells great, and lasts at least ~8 hours.  Yes it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the Old Spice High Endurance that I&#x27;ve been using for years does, but I feel better about the lack of chemicals on my skin so I&#x27;m willing to put up with a twice a day application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The missing star is only because of the twice a day application, granted that seems standard on all natural deodorants so I might eventually change it to a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> The deodorant smells great but just does not work for me. its to bad it smells great for about a hour or two but then the funk beging to breed. by the end of the day i odor offends myself just not for my big squatch pits.</li>
    <li> This deodorant does not smell like a Mountain. It smells like patchouli or sandalwood and should be named something else like &amp;#34;Far East&amp;#34;. The name &amp;#34;Mountain&amp;#34; is misleading.</li>
    <li> Smells good, long lasting, and comfortable. I was a bit worried that going to a natural deodorant after using an anti-perspirant would result in smelly sweaty pits. Not a problem with this deodorant. Smells good, controls odor and it seems like the smelly sweat was an issue of over use of anti-perspirant.</li>
    <li> Smells good . Works ok. You will still sweat</li>
    <li> IT is great it makes me feel clean and great I bought a couple set, for woman and man , it smells really fresh and best part it is not filled with chemicals for those who may have sensitive skin</li>
    <li> This  deodorant is fabulous!  I want to order more for my family.  They  love  it too.</li>
    <li> Patchouli lovers UNITE!!! This IS the sent for you!&lt;br /&gt;NOT the sent for me, STINKY! Can&#x27;t comment on product performance because could only wear once due to strong and offensive sent.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon, like always, took good care of me since I didn&#x27;t like the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried three of these Herban Cowboy deodorant sticks; Dusk, Forest and Mountain. Dusk is hands down the best smelling and Mountain the worst. Mountain smells like sour cabbage rotting in your armpits.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, wish it lasted longer.  That&#x27;s the price you pay for &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; ingredients.</li>
    <li> Smells GREAT!  Have to be blunt here, I smelled my pits at the end of a regular work day (hardware store), and they smelled awesome!  This stuff works great, and the fact that it is natural is even better.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is great and a change from all the cologne smell in the store. The only problem is that doesn&#x27;t last a full 8 hours at work and needs to be reapplied.</li>
    <li> Like it.  Have not used it for a while yet, but I see all pros and no cons.  You will not regret this buy if you care about toxicity on your body.  Buy it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. All other natural deodorant has made my armpits so dry it hurt to move my arms and itched like crazy. This works and doesn&#x27;t irritate my armpits. I put it on twice a day. It is NOT an anti persperant  as it doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum. I&#x27;m happy with this.</li>
    <li> I tried the Dusk scent which I enjoyed tremendously.  This one smells a bit like a can of bugspray to be honest.  I give it an extra star because it&#x27;s a natural deodorant but I could not even stand to apply this.  I tossed it after about 3 days</li>
    <li> my husband hated the smell and he had BO after wearing it :-(</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well but smells good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m relieved to find a good, alcohol-free deodorant, because unfortunately, over the years, I guess I have developed a reaction to alcohol-based deodo&#x27;s, they make my armpits itch like crazy, so far with Herban Cowboy no itchiness, so I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> When you want your pits to make a statement, this is the product for you. I love the scent as does my significant other. I do some international flights I wish the airline would give this stuff away on. Luckily, on those flights when it&#x27;s nap time, I can rest my head on either shoulder with confidence...</li>
    <li> I used it for maybe 2 weeks at most. It was a manly scent at first, but it wore off after maybe 5 hours. Less if you were active with anything. The worst part was, it made my sweat smell terrible. Switched back to a non-natural deodorant immediately and I can go to concerts without even once smelling my body odor. Some people may like this and it may work for them, I was not one of them.</li>
    <li> This is the only natural deodorant my husband will happily use. Many others didn&#x27;t get the job done, but this one meets his approval!</li>
    <li> One of the better natural deodorants I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing!!</li>
    <li> Goes on a bit wet but has a good scent.  Like others have said it compliments your own body order.  For me it lasts most of the day and I do like the scent.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought a bunch of these, one of each fragrance. I really like how it goes on. It works great. It lasts all day and virtually eliminated all the odor. This is my new deodorant.</li>
    <li> I appreciate that this is an all-natural deodorant, but the stench is horrendous and smells awful. It smells more like deet you&#x27;d spray on yourself to avoid ticks when camping in the woods on a mountainside rather than the mountainside itself. Do yourself a favor and go with the Dusk or Forest scent instead.</li>
    <li> This is the worst scent. It just smells so weird and nasty. I would definitely recommend trying the Forrest scent. It last much longer, and smells much better</li>
    <li> Subtle smell. Not really feminine, but works well being that it&#x27;s natural. You&#x27;d have to reapply throughout the day, if you&#x27;re doing strenuous activity</li>
    <li> I originally tried this for the ingredients.  I&#x27;ve been trying to find something with less chemicals, no dyes, aluminium, etc.  I really like the scent and have tried different ones from Herban Cowboy, but I&#x27;m a bit stinky by the time I get home.  At least for me it doesn&#x27;t last... can chalk that up to diet/genetics/whatever, but I need something that lasts longer.</li>
    <li> it protects against odor better than the other natural deodorants I have tried - going to try another scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands of natural deodorant and this is the only one that works.</li>
    <li> Straight up: for me, it&#x27;s not quite as effective as a regular deodorant BUT considering it doesn&#x27;t have the aluminum that may cause Alzheimer&#x27;s it&#x27;s a solid alternative. Worst case I will reapply and not have mental problems in my old age.</li>
    <li> got this to try a different scent but did not work at all constant BO smell with this like there other products but not this one</li>
    <li> Good quality last all day unless you go to the gym then put on more, love it .</li>
    <li> Mountain is awful &amp;  smells like licorice.  I threw it out because I assume that I cannot return used deodorant.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. It smells good but doesn&#x27;t prevent you from smelling bad.</li>
    <li> This product dosent work for me but the company seems like their care for there quality control so I&#x27;m not going to write a negative review .. But great customer care..thanks</li>
    <li> the forest scent is much better.  although this one does grow on you eventually... I will choose the forest over this one any day though</li>
