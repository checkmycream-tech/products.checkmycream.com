      <li>They responded quickly to make me a happy customer.</li>
      <li>So glad to be able to find this on amazon!</li>
      <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
      <li>Amazon has the best price on them by far.</li>
      <li>and then on Amazon (better price) and really liked it.  </li>
      <li>they had a deal going on where you would purchase the peel for $79 &amp; get the moisturizer free &amp; since I was very expectical about it and was just going to walk away without buying it the girl made me an offer that she would sale it to me for $25!!!!!</li>
      <li>Glad I did, &#x27;cause it sounds like they are also a con.</li>
      <li>I truly love this product and will buy it for myself.</li>
      <li>six more words required?</li>
      <li>Glad I did, &#x27;cause it sounds like they are also a con.</li>
      <li>In closing to my ramble, DSC is a well made product,just be sure to shop around for the best possible price.</li>
      <li>I waited a couple minutes and then just put lotion on for more moisture</li>
      <li>He would not give up and I should have known better</li>
      <li>I find it interesting that based on the reviews this is something that either works or it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I LOVE it</li>
      <li>In fact, I believe I would be able to extract \\&quot;skin\\&quot; off of most any surface.  </li>
      <li>and I immediately have to put lotion on and then more lotion and more and more.</li>
      <li>I am more of a holistic health girl</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
      <li>Tried to pay, but he would not let me go, holding my card and trying to keep pushing more products on me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;During the sale of this product, the sales girl rubbed some of the gel on the inside of my wrist, rubbed for a while and was able to show me \\&quot;skin\\&quot; which had peeled off.</li>
      <li>it, it was sooooo smooth!  </li>
      <li>She promised me that her products are 100 percent safe.</li>
      <li>I love the intensive eye serum, love the peel, and all of the moisturizers.</li>
      <li>but glad I did.  </li>
      <li>and it magically turned to \\&quot;skin  \\&quot; between paper,\\</li>
      <li>So you use a lot more product to do the job.</li>
      <li>Maybe putting more on gets more skin off.</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>The glycerin and aloe vera gel are what leave your skin feeling soft and looking good- two very cheap ingredients.</li>
      <li>The gel has a strong alcohol smell, and it stings the skin when applied.</li>
      <li>SUPER pushy!</li>
      <li>for the &amp;#34;extracts&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;minerals,&amp;#34; those are just thrown in to make this product sound fancy.</li>
      <li>The facial scrub I got with this purchase is great, although a bit drying.</li>
      <li>for the &amp;#34;extracts&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;minerals,&amp;#34; those are just thrown in to make this product sound fancy.</li>
      <li>However,with these great prices on Amazon, i decided to do some research and chose the Deep Sea Cosmetics brand.</li>
      <li>Cheap and moisturising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phenoxyethanol</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m cheap and almost didn&#x27;t buy</li>
      <li>He was also purposely trying to confuse me, offering me this or that for free if I bought that, then offering me another for another discount.</li>
      <li>I fit into the category of \\&quot;A fool and his money</li>
      <li>Like most everyone else I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t put most anything on it.</li>
      <li>facial peel is absolutely amazing!</li>
      <li>I originally purchased it for 15.00 a jar now</li>
      <li>I bought it when I went to a mall for $20 when originally the woman wanted me to pay $160 for both the gel and the moisturizer that comes with this product.</li>
      <li>it kind of reminds me of incredible by Victoria&#x27;s secret</li>
      <li>It has helped my face tremendously.</li>
      <li>and it works super well.</li>
      <li>I find the Deep Sea Cosmetics Facial Peeling Gel the best.</li>
      <li>Should have know better with all the high pressure that was used.  </li>
      <li>In higher concentrations in a significant skin irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In higher concentrations in a significant skin irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will definitely be getting more of this!</li>
      <li>and you seem like such a nice woman..</li>
      <li>It peels the skin away which is better for people like myself who have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a shot to try it</li>
      <li>it was exactly the same as the ones in the booths but much more affordable!</li>
      <li>I was able to extract a layer of skin off my granite counter-top, and then my iPad screen, toilet bowl seat, surface of a DVD, my LCD TV, a light bulb and a glass picture frame.  </li>
      <li>I had a problem with the company over the price &amp; order &amp; they did the right thing.  </li>
      <li>I noticed right off the bat that the so called skin that just rubs off is probably the gel just drying</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is sold by some mysterious huge parent company who has many differently named stores and rebrandings of the exact same products. For example, &amp;#34;Soap and Co&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Deja Vu&amp;#34; are other versions of &amp;#34;Deep Sea Cosmetics.&amp;#34; I think this is done on purpose so that it will harder to research their scams. Anyways, this &amp;#34;peeling gel&amp;#34; DOES NOT exfoliate at all. The glycerin and aloe vera gel are what leave your skin feeling soft and looking good- two very cheap ingredients. The &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34; you see is actually plastic. That&#x27;s why the gel will produce &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34; over and over and over without ever leaving your skin feeling raw or scrubbed off. Also why it will produce &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34; on literally any surface. I did some cursory research on the ingredients, and here is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: aqua (water), sd alcohol 40, glycerin, propylene glycol, carbomer, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, phenoxyethanol, anthemis nobilis (chamomile) flower extract, camellia oleifera extract, cucumber (cucumis sativus) extract, maris aqua (dead sea water), sodium hydroxide, fragrance (parfum), polyvinylalcohol crosspolymer, triethylene glycol, tocopheryl acetate (vit.E), Mentha piperita (peppermint) oil, triethanolamine, ginseng (panax ginseng) extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SD alcohol 40: Rubbing alcohol. Evaporates faster than water. Dissolves surface oils on skin. (Can dry out sensitive skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin: Humectant. Readily absorbs water. Attracts water from lower layer of skin and increases moisture on surface of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carbomer: Helps distribute or suspend an insoluble solid in liquid. Used to keep emulsions from separating into their oil and liquid components. Absorbs and retains water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe barbadensis leaf juice: Aloe vera gel. Cheap and moisturising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phenoxyethanol: An aromatic alcohol. Has a floral odor. Soluble in water. Used as a preservative. Evaporates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sodium hydroxide: Lye. Highly alkaline. In small amounts, regulates pH of a product. In higher concentrations in a significant skin irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polyvinylalcohol crosspolymer: This one is a creepy ingredient because I couldn&#x27;t find out much about it. From what I gathered on Google, I think it&#x27;s a solid dry powder that is insoluble but dispensable in water. Used as a bulking agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Triethylene glycol: Colorless, odorless viscous liquid. Used as a plasticizer for vinyl. Widely used as a dehumidifying agent. Attracts and absorbs water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Triethanolamine: Strong base. Used as an emulsifier and a surfactant. pH balancer. (I found something that says it may cause liver tumors in mice.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the &amp;#34;extracts&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;minerals,&amp;#34; those are just thrown in to make this product sound fancy. They&#x27;re in such small amounts that they might as well not be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a chemist, so I don&#x27;t 100% understand how these chemicals are interacting, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that most of the ingredients evaporate as you rub it on your face, leaving behind the no-longer emulsified vinyls and polymers. This is a grossly overpriced gimmick product made with cheap ingredients and its only real function is a moisturizer (because of the glycerin and aloe vera gel.)droxide: Lye. Highly alkaline.

    <li> I have been using this product for quite a while and just reordered because I like it so much.&lt;br /&gt;When used as directed you need to rub your skin over the sink for the dead skin to fall.&lt;br /&gt;(BTW, if this is some type of glue in the product rubbing off instead of skin as some have said, then&lt;br /&gt;why does my skin look so good afterwards?)  I am 72 and this product does wonders for me. I also use it&lt;br /&gt;on my arms and hands (it doesn&#x27;t take much).  I have learned other things that help as the skin gets older&lt;br /&gt;such as taking Udo Oil which makes my skin soft and velvety.  I always get compliments on my skin and&lt;br /&gt;people think I am in my 60&#x27;s,  but I do take good care of it and wear a hat in the sun.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. It has helped my face tremendously. I have a nicer complexion and my face is much smoother and clearer.[[ASIN:B000VFHA3O DEEP SEA COSMETICS FACIAL PEELING GEL - DEAD SEA]]</li>
    <li> Love , love ,love it !! I originally purchased it for 15.00 a jar now the price jumped to 75.00 can not afford that! . It is very gentle on skin yet removes all dead skin. I started using it 5 years ago, what a sham.</li>
    <li> Deep Sea Cosmetics Facial Peeling Gel - Dead Sea&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product instead of another brand because it was less expensive. This product is thick and gel-like, so it takes a lot to cover your face. So you use a lot more product to do the job. I also feel that this product does not quite do the job of peeling and making the skin feel smooth like the other one I used. So I will not be purchasing this product again. The container could have a bigger opening to be able to get at the product. Also, there is a lot of waste of plastic to make the product look pretty. I would rather pay less for a less attractive packaging and less waste. There are no recycle symbols on this package, odd, since it claims that it was \\&quot;MADE IN THE USA\\&quot;. I will go back to Vivo Per Lei facial peeling next time, it lasts a long time and does a much better job.</li>
    <li> I find the Deep Sea Cosmetics Facial Peeling Gel the best. It&#x27;s gentle, it does the job very well and for someone who has bad skin it&#x27;s great. I would recommend this product to anyone. I would recommend them buy it here on Amazon and not the mall, unless the product salesperson is willing to bargain the price. I bought it when I went to a mall for $20 when originally the woman wanted me to pay $160 for both the gel and the moisturizer that comes with this product. Overall, this product is great for those who have facial skin problems.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at the galleria mall only because the sales lady follwed me into icings any who I regret purchasing this because it removed a deep stain off my shirt so I can imagine what it would do to my face if you are looking for a great washing detergent well look no further you found it...</li>
    <li> Usually, exfoliating products just scrape dead skin off, but this product gently removes it without leaving your skin red and irritated. I like that it&#x27;s a gel and it&#x27;s easy to apply, and contrary to some other reviews, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot. You just apply a very thin layer and rub until your exfoliated skin comes off in little balls. I&#x27;m really impressed with this product - it&#x27;s great for people with oily skin and blackhead problems. I know this sounds like a canned endorsement, but I&#x27;m just a regular 30-something gal with troublesome skin.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell you how amazing all of these products are. I have had problems with periodic breakouts all of my life. I have used these products and have stopped all breaking out. I love the intensive eye serum, love the peel, and all of the moisturizers. I totally agree Amazon is the only way to buy these items, so much less expensive than going to the kiosk at the mall.</li>
    <li> People I also bought in the mall from a girl who wouldn&#x27;t take no for an answer this is ALWAYS a warning sign. I almost finished the jar of the facial peel when I decided to do a test I rubbed the material between rubber gloves and it magically turned to \\&quot;skin  \\&quot; between paper,\\&quot; skin again \\&quot; rub it between anything and it looks like skin. I think it&#x27;s kinda like glue which is why some people have a hard time removing it. In my opinion it&#x27;s a scam seriously if it was really doing what it says it would be alot more money![[ASIN:B003SSTL42 Vivo Per Lei Facial Peeling, 1.7-Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I picked this up on a trip to D.C.  love it!  I&#x27;m cheap and almost didn&#x27;t buy but glad I did.  I have sensitive, oily, bumpy skin.  Not much works for me.  But this made my skin smooth and soft without being irritating.  I use it once a week.  So glad to be able to find this on amazon!</li>
    <li> it does work I&#x27;m 21 years old I actually just got mine at a mall stand they had a deal going on where you would purchase the peel for $79 &amp; get the moisturizer free &amp; since I was very expectical about it and was just going to walk away without buying it the girl made me an offer that she would sale it to me for $25!!!!! and gave me a bunch of little samples of the moisturizer I couldn&#x27;t say no to THAT so I bought it it works wonders it whitened my face instantly I LOVE it but she told to use it ONLY ONCE a week since it peels a few layers of skin. at first when you are rubbing it on your skin you feel like its not doing anything since its not rough or anything it&#x27;s just a gel but once u wash it off your face is going to be much lighter and super soft the lotion smells gorgeous it kind of reminds me of incredible by Victoria&#x27;s secret</li>
    <li> I like &amp; bought this product. I had a problem with the company over the price &amp; order &amp; they did the right thing.  They responded quickly to make me a happy customer.</li>
    <li> I like this company normally but for some reason after a couple uses of the face peel it doesn&#x27;t seem to work anymore&#x3D;feels like a slight build up on the face. Maybe I am not using the product right? Anyway, the other products are fantastic though!!</li>
    <li> I paid way more for these products at the local mall. i will not buy them there any longer..way better price her by x3! This face peel works so well. I put it on let it set a few and then feel it off. I have no idea how the stuff works but it is like magic! The red sun damage on my nose disappears as well as anything built up on the skin! I have fair freckled skin, that is oily and this stuff is what my daughter and i call the magic cream!</li>
    <li> It works really well. I doesn&#x27;t burn or break me out at all. Very soft. My last bottle lasted a few months. You don&#x27;t need to use it everyday. Just about once a week. I really takes off that dead skin!</li>
    <li> A friend bought this product at a kiosk and gave me a facial peel at my home--ladies it even took off the \\&quot;peach\\&quot; fuzz that us older ladies get. Yes, the dead skin was gross, shocking actually, since I just had a professional facial the \\&quot;week\\&quot; before and it didn&#x27;t remove the \\&quot;peach fuzz\\&quot;. DSFPG did--my face wasn&#x27;t red, irritated or tender--it was wonderfully soft and with the DSCFP Moisturizer wonderful. Once a week is all you need for this product, I&#x27;m a believer![[ASIN:B000VFHA3O DEEP SEA COSMETICS FACIAL PEELING GEL - DEAD SEA]]</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product in a mall kiosk, but thankfully I didn&#x27;t buy it there for $80 and waited to get it online for much cheaper. It&#x27;s been a few weeks, but I&#x27;ve recommended this product to everyone, males and females, that I know. It makes my skin look brighter and reduced the number of blackheads I had. It also didn&#x27;t dry my skin out and kept it soft and healthy. I wish I would have found this earlier! It&#x27;s definitely worth a shot to try it, I can basically guarantee that you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> In Fort Lauderdale konnte ich dieses Produkt testen. Leider kaufte ich nur einen Artikel.  Nur bei Amazon fand ich diesen Artikel im Angebot. Die Lieferung erfolgte sehr schnell.  Den Artikel kann ich uneingeschränkt weiter empfehlen.</li>
    <li> I find it interesting that based on the reviews this is something that either works or it doesn&#x27;t. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any in between. It didn&#x27;t work for me what so ever and if I could I&#x27;d give it zero stars. IT didn&#x27;t work so why should it get even a single star? I got conned into buying this from some guy at the mall. He would not give up and I should have known better but he gave me half off and threw in a cleanser so I figured I was getting a good deal. Like other people have said, he tested it on my wrist and \\&quot;skin\\&quot; came off. I&#x27;ve since tested it myself on my face and on that same wrist with no result. I don&#x27;t know what that was but it clearly wasn&#x27;t skin. These kiosk workers are no better then con artists.I saw on the receipt that all sales are final. Gee, I wonder why. Never again will I buy anything from these people and they&#x27;ll get a piece of my mind the next time they try and stop me.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve used so far. I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly it not only stopped the break outs on my face, but it changed my skin completely.  I&#x27;ve never had this clear or radiant of skin. I will definitely be getting more of this!</li>
    <li> I was approached by a sales girl and due to her very aggressive advertising I was pressed to buy their products in the kiosk  of a mall. I told the sales girl that I have very sensitive skin and can not use random cosmetic products. She promised me that her products are 100 percent safe. Then I tried a few products on my arm and forehead feeling OK, I bought a few items, BUT on my way I started  to have allergic reactions. I drove back to return them (they are very expensive), they refused to issue me refund and pointed a small sign hidden among their products saying no refund will be issued. I feel I was totally ripped off!I am filing complaints with the mall as well as with BBB. So people, don&#x27;t fall for their scams. There are a lot of bad reviews you can find online regarding this company and its kiosks.</li>
    <li> I bought the sea salt scrub and the facial gel peel at the Westfield mall in San Francisco a month ago, and I just wanted to say that I wish I hadn&#x27;t! I should have trusted my instinct as it never bodes well when someone is so pushy as the DSC sales girl was. The gel it totally useless, it doesn&#x27;t do a thing. The salt srub is okay, but definitely not worth the ridiculous price of 59 USD! Never again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grandmother thinking it would even remotely worth is price, but I was wrong. This does not work at all.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product for many years around Christmas at the booths at our local mall for my wife.  The cost to purchase these items has never been the same as it depends on who the sales person is and how well they evaluate what you will spend.  Purchasing here was easy, with no pressure, and at 75% less then what I paid in the mall for the same product.  The packaging was good, and the shipping time the week before Christmas blew me away.  I did not pay for expedited shipping but got my package within 4 days.  I would highly recommend anyone wanting to buy this type of product to take advantage of the savings you will find here.</li>
    <li> I have used various Dead Sea products (Milk &amp; Honey scrub, facial peel,cleanser,and moisturizer) they all work very well. The only downside is the price if you are buying them from one of the stands in your local mall. Amazon has the best price on them by far. The price I paid total was 152 dollars and change. That is very steep price $49 per item plus tax. The only saving grace I can see is the fact these products will last a few months even with regular use. In closing to my ramble, DSC is a well made product,just be sure to shop around for the best possible price.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I saw this at a kiosk in Barton Creek Square Mall (Austin, TX) and would like to justify this item a bit further incase somebody was wanting to buy but got skeptical due to some of the reviews floating around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across this product at the kiosk like I had mentioned and was a bit skeptical with the process. The seller was brutally coming onto you as if trying to scam you into something you probably wouldn&#x27;t even want to buy. Anyways she placed some of this gel onto the back of my hand, rubbed it in and then kept rubbing until it came off (using a cotton) and bam all that dead skin that I&#x27;m so familiarize with. I have done all kinds of chemical (acid) peel so I know that is definitely my dead skin on there. Price wise I knew it was going to be around $100+ for both the peel and moisturizer so I left the kiosk and searched online on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s price was perfect and I could test all I want without feeling any buyer&#x27;s remorse! It came in via USPS pretty fast. I washed my face with a over the counter Salicylic acid cleanser, applied just a pea size gel+ (varies on your face so add a bit more but remember a little goes a long way!), dabbed on forehead, cheeks, nose, chin, temple etc.., rubbed it in gently, waited 8-9 mins since someone on YouTube recommended it, and then I rubbed my face in circular motion to get it off. At first I was like, where is all the dead skin (referring back to the experience at the mall as well) and got pretty frustrated. I looked down into the sink and it struck me. All of the dead skin (brown, black material) were in the sink. Everywhere! It was disgusting yet felt very exhilarating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I put on the Deep Sea Moisturizer which I highly recommend. One pump on the back of your hand, dab it in the areas and just use a circular motion around your face until it is absorbed into your skin. I have a Peptide Serum that I had bought from MakeUpArtistsChoice so I use that at night and the moisturizer in the morning since it contains SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it if you got acne or none. This product is a good acne PREVENTION (not cure)! Remember everyone is different so if it works for you go for it. If it doesn&#x27;t, don&#x27;t blame the product but yourself. I&#x27;ve gone through tons of product for acne and this is definitely aiding in preventing my acne from going rampant.ing since it contains SPF.    Highly recommend it if you got acne or none.

    <li> My daughter and I just bought this product today. I payed 50 dollars for it at the mall kiosk. The saleswoman was slightly aggressive, but not overly so.It was a pleasant experience and I may try the eye cream after I see how the product I bought from Lancome works.I have several of the other products available from Dead Sea Cosmetics, and they work amazingly well for me. So far this product seems to work for us. My skin feels so much softer and looks so much cleaner. I have sensitive skin so I will write another review after we have used it for a while to see if there are any negative things about this product. So far so good!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about a month ago and it does not exfoliate. I do believe that it is some kind of glue which peels off and not my dead skin cells. WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN[[ASIN:B000VFHA3O DEEP SEA COSMETICS FACIAL PEELING GEL - DEAD SEA]]</li>
    <li> I purchase this product from a very pushy sales person at the mall. This should have been my warning! This product is a waste of money. It cause a slight reaction to my skin. The product seems like it is taking off dead skin. In fact that is not the case. It is the product itself that looks like sticky glue and not old skin cells being removed from your face. Trust me do not waste your money on this product it is a SCAM and a RIP OFF!</li>
    <li> I have used this item in the past. the item that was sent to me has clearly evaporated or has been used. Gel isn&#x27;t dry and that is what was sent to me.  A clear dry gel!.  I  will never order from this seller again.  They refuse to take the product back and responded to my e-mail after I sent a second e-mail  YES I HATE IT!</li>
    <li> I almost bought this item yesterday, after being conned into stopping at their cart at the mall. This young man asked me a question in order to get me to stop, then gave me a sampleI to keep me there. You would not believe the cons and lies he told me! SUPER pushy! Tried to sell me tis product  for $80! Then told me if I bought another item for half price, he would give me the first one free. So I thought I&#x27;d go ahead and try it. Tried to pay, but he would not let me go, holding my card and trying to keep pushing more products on me. He was also purposely trying to confuse me, offering me this or that for free if I bought that, then offering me another for another discount. (and I am talking &amp;#34;discounting&amp;#34; from $80 to $50). Also, used the tired old line &amp;#34;Because I like you and you seem like such a nice woman..&amp;#34; Oh brother. THERE WERE NO MARKED PRICES anywhere, not even a &amp;#34;menu&amp;#34; you could look at or take home. Obviously, it was a way of making the con easier. I kept telling him my kids were waiting for me at a store, but he would NOT charge me and let me go! I finally bought one other product (I get panicky at the mall and he wasn&#x27;t helping) just to get the hell out of there. Two minutes later I realized I had been totally conned into buying stuff I don&#x27;t even need, so I went back and tried to return them. He said he couldn&#x27;t! They were facial products and may have been contaminated or already used. This was TWO MINUTES after I bought them! NO SIGN to tell you there are no returns, either. I finally had to get really, really mad, and then he treated me like I was being unreasonable and professed not to understand why I was so angry. I tried to tell him, nice at first, that I simply could not afford his stuff, and I was I needed my money for rent, and that he was being pushy and had kept me there entirely too long. He kept offering excuses and taking his time and acting as if he was insulted and I was nuts. When I sent one of my girls to get the map cops, he al of a sudden decided he could indeed give me my money back. It took about 1/2 hour to make my return, first offering me a &amp;#34;receipt&amp;#34; that had only $0 on it! Not itemization, no amount I was being refunded (he said the computer wasn&#x27;t working, so for my convenience he just gave me an empty receipt). When I scoffed, he acted as if I  had offended him and his integrity. I ended up at this stall for over an hour, the whole lime pleading with him to please let me go! When he finally did, my girls heard him call me a crazy b--ch. Funny thing was, I was going to keep one of the products, but after his rudeness I ended up giving it all back. Glad I did, &#x27;cause it sounds like they are also a con. STEER CLEAR when you see them at the mall!map cops, he al of a sudden decided he could indeed give me my money back.

    <li> This is a great product. I got suckered at the mall into buying this for like 60 bucks! I wish i would&#x27;ve looked it up and bought it on here first, it is much much cheaper! The guy said it would take away my razorburn and i didn&#x27;t really believe him but he said that i could try it and return it. he lied, when you purchase at the mall, then there is no refund. however, didn&#x27;t really care because the product does what it says it does. i use it with the hydro 3 blade razor and the sensitive skin shave gel, but i think that it&#x27;s really the product that makes the difference. so if anyone you know gets razorburn bad, then recommend them this product because it really does work.</li>
    <li> this is a great product for the cost. I like the way that it makes your face feel.I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have used other peeling gels before, and decided to try this one based on the reviews. It is really dissapointing. The gel has a strong alcohol smell, and it stings the skin when applied. After the application, my skin feels very dry. (You \\&quot;must\\&quot; use a moisturizer)</li>
    <li> I recieved this product in the mail today and I used it immediately.  I was so impressed.  It is very gentle.  It peels the skin away which is better for people like myself who have sensitive skin.  The average facial scrub would scrape my skin off and leave it red and irritated.  Amazon has the best price, deepseacosmetics.com sells the product for $64.95.  I will be ordering this product again!</li>
    <li> This is one of the few products that delivers on its claims.  It never dries or reddens the skin yet it takes off the dead tissue and leaves my face smooth and refreshed looking.</li>
    <li> Purchased this from a kiosk inside my local mall. I got two jars (one for free) and a facial scrub (also for free). Although, the \\&quot;free\\&quot; is debatable because it was still $120. But from what I&#x27;ve read, this brand is quite pricey. I bought them because the salesperson said one jar would last  me a year...so it&#x27;s only $10 a month and I spend more than that on other products usually. I was also impressed by the demo she did on my arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it does make my face feel great...I&#x27;m not sold that it&#x27;s actually my skin coming off. Mainly I find it odd that the more you put on makes more come off. But, this could be due to many factors. Maybe putting more on gets more skin off. Or maybe this week I had more dead skin than last week when I used less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really makes me question this product is that the balls of \\&quot;skin\\&quot; dissolve in water splashes that landed on the counter of my sink into a gooey slim again. Now - maybe it does this because the product binds with the skin... I can&#x27;t really say. Also, this wouldn&#x27;t be the first time that a pricey brand was lying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I would say buy their other products or buy something else. The facial scrub I got with this purchase is great, although a bit drying. I am more of a holistic health girl and I&#x27;m not a big fan of chemicals. But I bought it...so I use it. But I won&#x27;t be going back for more that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> I always wanted to try Dead sea products, but the high pricetag and the overwhelming amount of brands and their \\&quot;promises\\&quot; kept me a bit sceptical.However,with these great prices on Amazon, i decided to do some research and chose the Deep Sea Cosmetics brand. The shipping was extremely fast, the packaging looks very profesional, luxurious and classy and it really works! This brand do indeed contain Dead sea minerals, I&#x27;ve been only using them for 2 weeks and already I&#x27;m seeing and feeling improvements. I have sensitive skin and will normally react to additives, perfumes and aggresive chemical ingredients, but not with these products! I will continue using them, even at normal price, as you only need a little bit to use every time. 5 stars for me!</li>
    <li> Good product! it was exactly the same as the ones in the booths but much more affordable! It was actually the same size , I was pretty surprised it was for that price! good price!</li>
    <li> I had bought this product once at the mall and then on Amazon (better price) and really liked it.  Some people say the exfoliating effect is a scam but it always left my skin feeling really clean and fresh.  However, the 3rd time I tried it, it didn&#x27;t exfoliate at all.  I rubbed it into my skin but it didn&#x27;t work like before.  It didn&#x27;t do anything, so I just ended up washing it off.  I won&#x27;t buy it again because I think the formula must have changed.</li>
    <li> Very good cosmetic product! Good for acne prevention. I bought a set of proactiv three months ago and I threw it away after I tried the deep sea facial peeling.I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> best product ever!!!!! would recommend to anyone who is wanting to renew there skin..product smells great and leaves the skin feeling anew...A+++++++</li>
    <li> I usually walk right past the kiosks in the mall (Lakeline Mall in Cedar Park, Texas-Near Austin) but I decided to stop this time but had no intention of buying anything. She used the facial peel, moisturizer, nail buffer and cuticle oil on my hand and I was amazed enough that I decided to see what the price was. She told me she would give me a deal on all of the products (which also included a body lotion)for $179. There was no way I was buying it at that price! I ended up getting all 5 products for $79. I keep reading  reviews of people buying ONE product for that so I feel I got a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The facial peel is absolutely amazing! As soon as I got home I used it on my face, neck and upper arms (I tend to get breakouts there due to dead skin) and everything feels super soft and is glowing...after a single use! The body lotion smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. The nail buffer has left my nails so shiny that it looks like I have clear polish on and it&#x27;s last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it a 5 star but I want to see what it does to my skin over time and if my skin problems fade. But so far, I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My first time purchasing Deep Sea Cosmetics Facial Peeling Gel was at one of the mall kiosks.  I hate going to malls, but must suck it up in order to visit Sephora (I&#x27;m a total product junkie--not makeup, just products).  Annnnd, of course, I was accosted by one of those annoying kiosk vendors and kind of got suckered into buying this.  He applied the product to the inside of my wrist and, dang it, it was sooooo smooth!  $80 later I was kicking myself for giving in, but upon returning home and trying it, I was able to justify the cost (after all--like the kiosk vendor said, \\&quot;You only get one face.\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this facial peel quickly became one of my favorite weekly rituals.  It REALLY helps improve the texture, tone, and vibrancy of my skin as well as removing blackheads, minimizing my pores, and reducing the occurrence of breakouts to which my skin is unfortunately prone.  AND you can actually see it working--after it sits for a minute and you start rubbing it off, it&#x27;s really amazing (and kind of disgusting) to see how much dead skin is being exfoliated, especially since it is to be used on a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to cheat on Sephora, but I really, really love this product and highly recommend it for just about anyone.  Extra super bonus to find it on Amazon FAR less expensive and without the hassle and annoyance of the mall.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  After about a minute of massaging the gel onto my face, the dead layers of skin started to peel off and I was left with softer, smoother skin that I&#x27;ve had in many years.  Being over 60, anything that produces a result like this is going to stay on my cleansing regimine as long as I can find the product.</li>
    <li> I was sold this like everyone else here, and like the other who have given it 1 star.... It is a scam. The product stuck to my face too... I had to pull the stuck bits off one by one.... Even a rough Muslim cloth would not get them off! The only exfoliation is due to ripping glue that sticks to your face off!!! Absolute scam. And as others say, expensive too.</li>
    <li> I thought this was Seacret peel. Bait and switch. Do not use this product. six more words required? Do not use</li>
    <li> Visited Valley Fair Mall and was \\&quot;suckered\\&quot; in to buying this product at $50.  Later realized I could purchase this from Amazon for half.  Anyway, I&#x27;ll try to get my money back later, but read on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the sale of this product, the sales girl rubbed some of the gel on the inside of my wrist, rubbed for a while and was able to show me \\&quot;skin\\&quot; which had peeled off. I bought into it...When I got home I tried an experiment.  I rubbed some of the gel on my granite counter-top.  Guess what! I was able to extract a layer of skin off my granite counter-top, and then my iPad screen, toilet bowl seat, surface of a DVD, my LCD TV, a light bulb and a glass picture frame.  In fact, I believe I would be able to extract \\&quot;skin\\&quot; off of most any surface.  Just rub some on, wait a few minutes for the gel to break down and you&#x27;ll be able to rub the \\&quot;skin\\&quot; off (I believe) any hard surface.  I don&#x27;t know what residual chemical causes this coagulation.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what to think about it. I have pretty oily skin so I bought this awesome foundation (very expensive) meant for oily skin and it works super well. It kept my face dry (in a good way) for the whole day. Then I got suckered into buying this product. I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks now and my face is getting TWICE as oily. It&#x27;s also getting oily with my foundation that is supposed to mattify your oily face, which it used to. I&#x27;m scared because I don&#x27;t want my face to get worse but I don&#x27;t want to just stop because I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s part of the process. HELP ME PLEASE</li>
    <li> I used the facial scrub and couldn&#x27;t get it off my right cheek.  I tried rinsing with water, and ultimately resorted to scraping it off with my fingernails.  Has anyone else had this issue?  I feel I got ripped off.  Should have know better with all the high pressure that was used.  I fit into the category of \\&quot;A fool and his money are soon parted\\&quot;.  This is the second scam for me, the first was the sheets in the kiosk at the mall.  Once I got home I saw they were kleenex thin.  Shame on me!</li>
    <li> This product really worked well for me. Like most everyone else I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t put most anything on it. My sister and I got hustled into a kiosk for the body scrub and butter. The lady was super pushy and talked really close to us so I figured she was just low on sales and really needed to get someone to buy from her. We let her put the face peel on our wrists and it worked wonderfully but they wanted 150 for it! After a lot of debate the lady finally offered it to my sister for 29 so she took it. When we got home I tried it. I noticed right off the bat that the so called skin that just rubs off is probably the gel just drying but the gross dirt attached was definitely mine. Most things I use on my face leave it very dry and I immediately have to put lotion on and then more lotion and more and more. With this I didn&#x27;t have to do it immediately. I waited a couple minutes and then just put lotion on for more moisture and I have not had this nice of skin in forever. I truly love this product and will buy it for myself.</li>
    <li> Great product.  She asked for it and I had never heard of it but she said it works very well.</li>
</ol>
