### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>lip gloss is the best to prevent that</li>
      <li>So I thought maybe Nars was onto something and this shade would go perfectly with my semi-fair olive skin tone.  </li>
      <li>this is the best lipgloss ive ever owned</li>
      <li>I am still experimenting with which lipsticks/lipliners it looks best with to find something I might love it with.</li>
      <li>Turkish Delight is one of their more popular colors.</li>
      <li>and I love wearing it as my \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; go to lip gloss.  </li>
      <li>One of my favorite lip gloss..</li>
      <li>and she likes how it goes one nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>Being Turkish, I thought the name of this color was fitting (Turkish Delight).  </li>
      <li>LOVE this.</li>
      <li>Love the color &amp;#34;Turkish Delight&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>ordered three more</li>
      <li>Easy to wear with any color on the face.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like really strong scented lip glosses that you end up smelling all day giving you a headache.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for something light</li>
      <li>but this is almost too light.  </li>
      <li>but I liked it so much that</li>
      <li>It is extremely smooth and creamy.</li>
      <li>fantastic nude pink lip-gloss, not too greasy great color</li>
      <li>this is wonderful but smells a little funny.  </li>
      <li>Great combined with the smokey eye or even with minimal make up..</li>
      <li>It is a very light, kind of milky pink color.</li>
      <li>Like all glosses it wears off quickly.</li>
      <li>the other half bought this to make me happy!</li>
      <li>It is the perfect shade of pale pink.  </li>
      <li>It makes my lips looks kind of dead</li>
      <li>Overall, I love the consistency, even though I am not crazy about the color, and will definitely purchase another NARS lipgloss in the future!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m older and my lips don&#x27;t have much natural color anymore.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a pretty color</li>
      <li>It definitely feels like a higher end lipgloss.</li>
      <li>Overall I really like the consistency of this gloss.</li>
      <li>Maybe something in the berry family or red , depending how much you want to darken it up.</li>
      <li>It is a nice, soft, pale pink that anyone of any skin color could wear.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a sheer, sophisticated peach based pink - a baby pink.</li>
      <li>This was my first NARS lipgloss, and definitely my most expensive lipgloss I have purchased to date!</li>
      <li>Lighter than expected but decent product.</li>

<li> The Turkish Delight works as a lip gloss by itself, and as a way to tone down a garish lipstick.</li>
<li> (dark lipstick looks too harsh on me now)</li>
<li> A little lighter and colorless than I would like.  </li>
<li> but the taste/smell is hard to get past.</li>
<li> Thick and Luster is what I like in a lipgloss</li>
<li> I bought this because a lot of other people reviewed it, and were obsessed with it.</li>
<li> This lipgloss was too pale, unflattering, and all nars lipglosses are way too sticky, make my lips peel, smell and taste bad.  </li>
<li> Sorry</li>
<li> I was skeptical about ordering something I had not yet tried</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t notice a smell when I use it all (I know a few people who claim these stink horribly.)</li>
<li> the gloss stinks.</li>
<li> Get this gloss, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
<li> It smells so bad, so when it&#x27;s on your lips-</li>
<li> $26 is a lot for a lipgloss that stinks!</li>
<li> Horrible taste.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is almost a daily color that I use. Easy to wear with any color on the face. Great combined with the smokey eye or even with minimal make up.. One of my favorite lip gloss..</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the nars turkish delight and it is definitely not what I expected. It makes my lips looks kind of dead and I am of an medium to olive complexion. Try it on before you buy it, do not just purchase it online like I did.</li>
    <li> If you buy this, I would recommend using a lip liner. Maybe something in the berry family or red , depending how much you want to darken it up.</li>
    <li> Thick and Luster is what I like in a lipgloss and this is it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because a lot of other people reviewed it, and were obsessed with it. I definitely like the feeling of the gloss, and the application. BUTTT the gloss stinks. It smells so bad, so when it&#x27;s on your lips- you can actually smell it! I thought it was just mine ...But I looked it up and others have the same review! I don&#x27;t know if this is a big deal for others, but it makes a difference to me. $26 is a lot for a lipgloss that stinks!</li>
    <li> A little lighter and colorless than I would like.  I&#x27;m older and my lips don&#x27;t have much natural color anymore.  I was looking for something light (dark lipstick looks too harsh on me now) but this is almost too light.  Like all glosses it wears off quickly.</li>
    <li> this is wonderful but smells a little funny.  It does give the perfect&lt;br /&gt;nudish/pinkish gloss look.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> The Turkish Delight works as a lip gloss by itself, and as a way to tone down a garish lipstick. It is a nice, soft, pale pink that anyone of any skin color could wear.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about ordering something I had not yet tried but I liked it so much that&lt;br /&gt;I ordered three more and they all arrived timely.</li>
    <li> Love the color &amp;#34;Turkish Delight&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s a sheer, sophisticated peach based pink - a baby pink. Not sticky.  LOVE this.</li>
    <li> this is the best lipgloss ive ever owned</li>
    <li> Being Turkish, I thought the name of this color was fitting (Turkish Delight).  So I thought maybe Nars was onto something and this shade would go perfectly with my semi-fair olive skin tone.  Well, they were onto something.  It is the perfect shade of pale pink.  It goes with anything and I love wearing it as my \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; go to lip gloss.  It has a very subtle non-perfumey smell which I really like.  I don&#x27;t like really strong scented lip glosses that you end up smelling all day giving you a headache.  Get this gloss, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> the other half bought this to make me happy! so when you go for a kiss, you don&#x27;t have sparkles all over your face, yuck. Sorry but the last thing i want is to continue a converstation elsewhere to have sparkles shining off your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this lip gloss is the best to prevent that and she likes how it goes one nice and smooth. A winner in my book</li>
    <li> Lighter than expected but decent product.</li>
    <li> Horrible taste. Didn&#x27;t look like the color I have purchased before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Nars lipsticks and I decided to try the gloss. Turkish Delight is one of their more popular colors. It&#x27;s such a pretty color but the taste/smell is hard to get past. I&#x27;m going to look for a similar color in a different brand.</li>
    <li> This was my first NARS lipgloss, and definitely my most expensive lipgloss I have purchased to date! This is one of those products that I have heard people rave about over the last few years, and just had to try it for myself! Overall I really like the consistency of this gloss. It is extremely smooth and creamy. It definitely feels like a higher end lipgloss. I don&#x27;t notice a smell when I use it all (I know a few people who claim these stink horribly.) The color is the only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars. It is a very light, kind of milky pink color. It just looks different then I had imagined it to look, even though I had viewed swatches of it and seen people wear it in blogs and stuff. I am still experimenting with which lipsticks/lipliners it looks best with to find something I might love it with. Overall, I love the consistency, even though I am not crazy about the color, and will definitely purchase another NARS lipgloss in the future!</li>
    <li> fantastic nude pink lip-gloss, not too greasy great color</li>
    <li> This lipgloss was too pale, unflattering, and all nars lipglosses are way too sticky, make my lips peel, smell and taste bad.  My go to lip glosses are revlon over the counter lipgloss.</li>
