<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> BEST SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER! I have fine damaged hair and it left it smooth every time!</li>
    <li> I like it but it didn&#x27;t really leave my hair all that soft which i expected. I find my self trying everything else but using it. I guess I just didn&#x27;t care for it all that much. I have used other products and liked it and expected to like this one, but it just didn&#x27;t do it for my hair. I guess you don&#x27;t know until you try it. It has a good smell and good texture, just didn&#x27;t seem to be hydrating enough or make my hair soft enough. It just felt average to me.</li>
    <li> Joico moisture recovery has make my hair feel so clean and smooth and detangled.  I really like it.  The price isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve since purchased this product twice now. I love it. The smell is great and the results are awesome! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I tried Joico Moisture Recovery after a hair dresser suggested it for my problem hair. My hair is really curly, frizzy and my scalp often dries out quickly. These products immediately started making a difference. I use the shampoo and conditioner about every other day and it makes my hair so much more manageable. I also used the Moisture Recovery Treatment Balm once every other week which makes my hair feel so silky smooth. This is the cheapest I&#x27;ve been able to find and it&#x27;s totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great for colored treated hair. A little goes a long way in caring for treated hair and keeping the color longer.  Leaves the hair feeling great. A great price for this product as it can be expensive in the beauty stores!</li>
    <li> Very good product to hydrate your hair. I have use it before and it is a great product.  I have received it on time in excellent conditions. I recommend you to use that product.</li>
    <li> please your hair either over product or completely nodded awful awful awful</li>
    <li> Love this Shampoo and conditioner. The scent smells really good, leaves my hair soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> So happy to have found this incredible duo.  It has a wonderful feel as the shampoo lathers.  The conditioner leaves my hair soft.  So nice.  The price is reasonable.  Completely a winner.  Sometimes one gets lucky.  I will always buy.  My search is over.  Thankyou Joico and Amazon.</li>
    <li> Perfect!! My wife liked it.</li>
    <li> Good to have a Conditioner that combs through easily.  However, I&#x27;m only in week 3 of my relaxer....the true test is week 10, so I will update then.</li>
    <li> good product. would buy again. right now having dandruff, these products doesnt help, but its depends on the person, skin, hair type, etc.</li>
    <li> Have tried lots of expensive shampoos and conditioners. I have only had this joico duo for a week and can feel the difference. So far so good.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do much good nor bad for my hair. I am a blonde with very dry damaged hair. I used this shampoo and conditioner as a hydrator, and the joico keratin leave in oil as a treatment. I finished 2 32 ounce bottles of the shampoo and conditioner with no noticed improvments in the moisture level or health of my hair. I had high hopes due to the excellent reviews. If you have dry damaged hair like me I recommend that you continue on your search for the perfect shampoo and conditioner because this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried three Joico shampoos and conditioners, and I love them all, but this is definitely my favorite.  I don&#x27;t have dry hair, but it makes my hair feel so smooth and healthy.  Oh and the scent is fantastic</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice and have already noticed a huge difference! I have fine hair but a lot of it. I am a nurse so my hair is up a lot and this product gives it the moisture it needs. Will definitely be buying bigger bottles!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I am African American with natural hair. The ph balance is perfect and LABELED! Truly amazing results as far as moisture and feel go. I&#x27;ve used quite a bit of stuff, I&#x27;ve been using organic shampoo (Kiss My Face - Mistreated and Whenever) for about a year now, but recently needed something different to add moisture and I&#x27;ve found it! I&#x27;ll be using this for a minute. I&#x27;m very happy and thoroughly pleased. Trust me, its worth the money.</li>
    <li> My hair feels so soft and manageable when I use this product.  I have dry, naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> Had tried years ago and wish never stopped using. Makes hair so soft.</li>
    <li> These are nice, makes my hair soft. And I like the smell.</li>
    <li> I love how soft my hair has become.  Added plus my hair&#x27;s build up has reduced a ton!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend for anyone who has thick hair like myself.</li>
    <li> Since I am allergic to gluten, I needed to find a new shampoo/conditioner that were gluten free (GF).  Since these are both GF, I tried them and was pleased to find such nice products.  I have thick long hair and this combo is perfect for me!</li>
    <li> I had tried other products and they didn&#x27;t do as they stated, but I was pleasantly surprised by this duo.  I have been color treating my hair for 20 years and was absolutely pleased with the results immediately.  Even after only 2 weeks of use, I went to get my hair colored and my hairdresser asked me what I had done differently since my last appointment and when I mentioned that I had switched to Joico, she told me that my hair seemed healthier and that it took the color better. It has been a month now of only using these products and my hair is thicker, shinier and less frizzy. I do have to use a lot of the shampoo because I have longer hair, but it is worth the results I am getting. I know everyone&#x27;s hair is different and it has taken me a lot of tries to find a combination that worked for me, but if you have been told that your hair is catlike and the texture is dry and hard to style, this very well could work for you too.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> This is a great every day shampoo / conditioner set.  I was using Aveda products forever and I still think their lines are great.  However I don&#x27;t like getting into a rut so now I alternate Moisture Recovery with the K Pak and my hair looks even better.  I rarely put heat to my hair, I don&#x27;t use product in it, I don&#x27;t color it but I insist on a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.  This stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> My hair is doing so much better after I started using these products. I would definitely recommend this products to others.</li>
    <li> Great deal on these products!  Fast shipping, too.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Its really small. Looks bigger in picture. The conditioner for it is better. I thought it would have the old Joico smell.</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves my hair so soft and silky. I have been using it along with the K Pak treatment, since then I haven&#x27;t even had to use my straightener! I have blonde very damaged hair, and I heard that this is the best for damaged hair. It&#x27;s true!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner.  I have fine, dry hair and it doesn&#x27;t make it flat, limp, or feel like it&#x27;s stripping my hair.  A small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Nice set, good price. I like the conditioner better than the shampoo. But that is just personal preference. They both work well.</li>
    <li> Would recommend to women with natural and relaxed hair because it makes your hair so much more softer. A plus.</li>
    <li> My hair is often pretty dry from using cheap hair dyes.  You&#x27;d never know it after I use the Joico Moisture Recovery shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it seems to condition well.</li>
    <li> I love this product...for winter use and after clarifying. It makes my fine hair very silky and manageable.A must have for me!</li>
    <li> Its shampoo and conditioner. Not better than anything you could find as a bargain at the local drug store but nothing terribly wrong with it.</li>
    <li> I love this product and you will too. Smells great, only thing you might want different is bigger bottles. Thanx</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Not a game changer-- like, if you&#x27;re looking for something to help your thinning hair or hair that&#x27;s extremely dry, it&#x27;s not going to make it completely amazing in just one wash. You&#x27;ll probably need to go to a little higher price point for that. But, as is, this shampoo is lovely. The smell is wonderful, and I could see a difference in moisture of my hair, as well as overall &amp;#34;healthiness&amp;#34; the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thinning hair and bought this because I felt like my old go-to&#x27;s where a little harmful to my hair (Whole Foods 365, Avalon Organics), or just not sitting right with it. My hair definitely likes this and I&#x27;ll use it in my regular shampoo rotation.</li>
    <li> For some background, I have long, curly hair (mix of 3a and 3b) which frizzes like crazy around my fringe. Before purchasing this product I had been using Herbal Essences for years, but I have also used Joico KPak deep conditioner (which I still use and love). HE just wasn&#x27;t doing it for me anymore and in my search for some gentler shampoos/conditioners I came across really good reviews about Joico Moisture Recovery products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I bought this! My hair feels so unbelievably soft that even my boyfriend noticed. After one use I noticed a difference in my hair texture and while it doesn&#x27;t tame all the baby hairs (nothing ever has) it leaves my hair super silky and shiny. I do feel the need to shampoo twice with this (I only needed to shampoo one time with HE) because I feel like it doesn&#x27;t get the buildup through all of my hair the first time around. I don&#x27;t mind shampooing twice since I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday (maybe 3-4 days). I thought it was worth mentioning though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most impressive part of these products are their ability to keep my crazy curly hair from tangling and knotting up right away. Tangles and knots are my worst problem with my hair, and whether I wear it up or down it likes to become like one big dreadlock in the back (not cute &amp; definitely not easy to comb out!). I was skeptical when I read the reviews about how this stuff detangles, but I am a believer now. It is incredibly easy to comb through my hair now and it immediately helped my hair by keeping it relatively tangle free for considerably longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is definitely worth trying. I will buy the biggest size I can when I run out of this.</li>
    <li> Joico has helped my husband scalp and moisture is good for me too .Reno is such a dry climate he was having trouble with his scalp. The doctor said it was dandruff it was from the dry climate. Thank you, we loved Joice before and the new Moisture Recovery is terrific. Julia</li>
    <li> Made my hair silky and smells wonderful.  Joico is an amazing brand for parched and damaged hair, It will do wonders. Great price too!</li>
    <li> Great product but not for me. Dries my hair out. But love the smell. Works great on relaxed hair though but my natural 4c hair dislikes :(</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my guest bathroom, but took the liberty of using it when my scalp got really dry after having my hair colored.  This stuff really did work like a charm, and without leaving my hair feeling greasy and gross.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter-in-law, it was recommended by my stylist. This is product works well for dry processed hair, it has a nice smell and is not heavy , does not weigh your hair down, she loves it.</li>
    <li> Does what shampoo and conditioner does.. Didn&#x27;t add any extra moisture</li>
    <li> I use Joico shampoos and conditioners a lot, whatever they are , they are just perfect for my hair. I have fine colored hair</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner did nothing to improve my hair.</li>
    <li> Have used this Shampoo for a long time.  Like it very much.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before I bought a new shampoo for my dry hair, and all of the reviews seemed to say that Joico was the brand to get for a moisture shampoo and conditioner set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great, I&#x27;m a guy and this didn&#x27;t smell girly at all, more like the professional smell that you&#x27;d expect from a fancy salon. But the real wonder here is how it works. My hair was hydrated, and had a great new shine to it. I definitely noticed a big difference in my normally dry hair after using this product for a few days. It did a great job in rejuvenating my head and I would definitely recommend this to anyone with dry hair. It&#x27;s worth the money for the quality you get!</li>
    <li> I love Joico products and this one works great and smells nice too.</li>
    <li> leaves my hair soft, and it smells pretty good. I do recommend this set,</li>
    <li> Black thick hair turns soft and shiny</li>
    <li> It takes a bit longer to blow dry my hair, but it holds a lot more moisture &amp; looks &amp; feels great.  I have been growing my hair out &amp; anyone with long hair knows that you have to start dealing with the frizzies.  So far...I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Anyone who says they used this on damaged hair and had success clearly did not have damaged hair. This stuff has been horrible for me. I am a platinum blonde so I have to get shampoos and conditioners that repair. This stuff smells fabulous, but did not keep my hair soft at all. I have not even used all of it because I just can&#x27;t let it continue to damage my hair. I adore Joico products, but this has been a failure for them as far as I am concerned. Their leave in spray conditioner is great, but these products do not compare to Alterna&#x27;s moisturizing products. I would pass on these if you bleach your hair. Regular color treatments would probably do well, which is why this is a two-star review instead of a one-star.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It was recommended by my hairdresser and really helped mine when it was damaged. Can&#x27;t believe the difference it makes</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Works quite well. I have pretty normal hair and it&#x27;s just what I needed. No frills or bells just soft shiny hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It does what it says!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I had never heard of the brand before, but my friend told me that her hairdresser sells it.  It smells so nice and fresh - I am very pleased with how my hair feels, too.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner and this size is perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> Im sure this product works for some people. It just didn&#x27;t do what i was expecting it to.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should buy this shampoo and conditioner at first, but I loved it. And so does my hair.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner from Joico! Gives my hair volume and smells good!</li>
    <li> Works great, fast delivery, nice quantity.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo&lt;br /&gt;!!!</li>
    <li> I felt like it didn&#x27;t moisturize my hair entirely, but oiled up my scalp. I have pretty normal hair but its gets dry and little whiry at the end. The smell, I couldn&#x27;t explain it. Its almost like a mint, but some sort of herbal smell maybe? I didn&#x27;t like it though. The shampoo made my hair feel very nice though, then if I just used conditioner on the ends of my hair it seemed to work better.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! Great price and it makes my hair feel so soft. It also makes my fine hair feel a little bit fuller!!</li>
    <li> My hair was damaged from dyeing it over the years, but this product had brought it back to being healthy again. Will continue to use this product as long as they make it!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.  I have color treated hair and battle dryness constantly.  This stuff works and makes my hair much softer and shiny.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love all of the Joico products.  The shampoo and conditioner always leave my hair feeling clean and moisturized. Great!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and I was really impressed by the conditioner. Also it smells great. Makes it easy to comb my hair after a shower. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this, it worked well.  However, my hair became very greasy after the 2nd use.  It was very difficult to wash the greasy feeling out.  This shampoo is not for everyone.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this line of hair care. I have very fine hair and I was always struggling with dry, split ends. This product leaves my hair soft and shiny even if I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday. This line works miracles!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo/conditioner set was good but not great.  My hair was really, really damaged and I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to work miracles but just to help me make my hair more manageable. The conditioner especially help with the manageability because my hair was so dried out from bleaching it.  It smelled great and I liked catching little whiffs of it through out the day.  The reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is I don&#x27;t think it works better then other slightly less expensive products.  I got the same perks from TIGI&#x27;s resurrection shampoo/conditioner set but I can get a 1 liter set of TIGI for about the same price as Joico&#x27;s 10.1 oz. set.  I would recommend this product to others but I don&#x27;t know if I personally will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product my hair is color treated and it works well to keep my hair feeling healthy. I really love the smell of this product as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisture for damaged hair. Left my hair soft, manageable,  without feeling weighed down. I would recommend this product to others with dry damaged hair</li>
    <li> I always use this product for my hair, it work very well.</li>
    <li> I like it, but have used other Joico Products before that i enjoyed more..</li>
    <li> such a joico fan and this is a new love. my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy or heavy i really like this!!!</li>
    <li> I thought this shampoo was going to be outstanding based on the reviews.  I found it average.  I&#x27;m African American and it didn&#x27;t nourish and condition my hair well . . . the shampoo was just okay.  In my opinion Herbal Essence is better!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using these products and they have worked well on my hair (fine hair, prone to dry ends) so far. Package arrived with no problems.</li>
    <li> As the brand joico...it used to be such an amazing brand of shampoo and conditioner....not any more. it compares to suave...nothing special  .  I expected more  .</li>
    <li> Reviewed before.  Great stuff that leaves my hair feeling silky but not heavy or greasy.</li>
    <li> My all times favorite. Truly it&#x27;s an amazing product. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I loved this shampoo and conditioner. It does smell a little strong but it smells better after your hair has dried. It made my hair very soft and shiny and not greasy or heavy.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. it makes my hair feel light and soft. and I have coarse hair</li>
    <li> Started using this shampoo and conditioner about a month ago, and I&#x27;m absolutely loving it! Hair feels so soft!</li>
    <li> the moisture recovery leaves my hair feeling so soft.  Tried the KPak from Joico but did not do the joy that the moisture recovery does.  My hair is frizzy, very dry, coarse and thick.  Even after shampooing it feels soft. Top it off with conditioner and balm and I am good to go.</li>
    <li> I completelly love this product my hair is so much shinny and light with just one wash, love love love</li>
    <li> This is by far the best conditioner I have ever used. I like the shampoo but the conditioner blew me out of the water. It made my hair feel so soft and silky!</li>
    <li> The product came in good packaging and the products work great for my dry transitioning african american hair.  If you go to a TJ Maxx you will spend $8 on each bottle, so this was a steal.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is awesome.  After the very first wash, my hair immediately felt more moisturized and less dry.</li>
    <li> I really liked this shampoo, and the price is pretty low considering how much this would cost if you would buy this at a salon.</li>
    <li> I began using these two products nearly a year ago now.  My hair is so healthy and soft it still surprises me.  The moisture recovery system is AMAZING.  I have very long, very thick hair.  My roots tend to oil up in 2 days while the ends are dry, frizzed and wirey.  Since I have begun using these products, I can go up to five days with out washing it if I have to (didn&#x27;t say want to).  My roots do not get covered in oil and my ends do not dry and split.  I personally really like the smell of the products, especially, once my hair has dried. If you have difficult or wirey hair/ and or dry, frizzy hair try this combo of moisture recovery shampoo and conditioner it has worked wonders and tamed what I had previously decided was untamable.</li>
    <li> These are the best moisture shampoo &amp; conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used, by far.  They work better together, definitely.  After a bottle of each, you&#x27;ll feel a noticeable difference in your hair.  For a point of reference, I have gotten my hair highlighted for many years, so it needs the extra moisture.  Joico moisture shampoo &amp; conditioner, plus a little argon oil before I blow dry, is all I need for soft, healthy hair &amp; ends!  Plus, they smell great!  (They have a very light, clean smell.)  I highly recommend these products to everyone!</li>
    <li> After complaining to my hairdresser about my dry flyaway hair she recommended Joico Moisture Recovery Shampoo and Conditioner. I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks now and can see a marked improvement in the condition of my hair. It looks and feels great.....and no more static! The bottles are large and should last all summer. I will definitely re-order! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Believe me I know this product and there is nothing that works better than Joico Moisture Recovery.. having said that I ordered from this seller and was horribly disappointed with the result. The package containing the shampoo and conditioner inside of the shipping box wasnt even for Joico Moisture Recovery but some other product by Joico and the box was about half the size of the shampoo and conditioner, on top of that the shampoo&#x27;s cap was unscrewed half way and dripping down the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont know who this seller thinks they are to provide such garbage service or if they think they can just sample shampoos and conditioners and later sell them as new products on Amazon but I highly suggest no one else buys from them.</li>
    <li> These products have really made a difference in my hair.  Since using them my hair is stronger, thicker and it&#x27;s growing.</li>
    <li> I love it!!This is indispensable to me.I gave also to the friend for gift,because this is very good.Moisture and gloss appear in hair.</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo, Conditioner Left my hair very soft..</li>
    <li> if you hair is very dry or damage this product is the best to recover healthy hair</li>
    <li> Product came in a doubtful condition. The shampoo level was quite below normal, as if somebody had taken some shampoo out/replaced the shampoo. Returned the product.</li>
    <li> I swear by Joico...anything by them is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!! I constantly dye my hair and i mean platinum blonde to jet black so it has gone through alot of damage.  I also blow dry and straighten it everyday. Let me tell you.....you can&#x27;t tell AT ALL!!! This stuff is beyond amazing and i won&#x27;t ever use anything else! I switched to the Moisture Recovery becuase when i last saw my stylist she said my ends were dead (and i hadn&#x27;t been using Joico cuz i ran out...nice) within just one wash omg my hair looks amazing and is so soft and healthy and shinny.  The shampoo was so silky and felt great putting it on.  A little goes a long way. EVERY girl should have this or anything from the Joico line.  The liters are the best way to go, mine can last over 6mos!!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo on the market for my type of hair, thick, curley chemical treated , course hair.</li>
    <li> I love Joico brand shampoo and conditioner - The blue one is the best and the green one is pretty awesome too</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best for fine hair. My hair feels great and shiny after the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo and conditioner that works on my biracial daughter&#x27;s hair.  We used to find it in salons, but now we primarily find it only on line, but it&#x27;s worth the money for her!</li>
    <li> My hair was soft and detangled very easily after use. Also smells good!</li>
    <li> Works well with the treatment balm</li>
    <li> The best for my dry hair! It makes it very soft and my hair finally doesn&#x27;t look damaged.</li>
    <li> I was blown away by this product.  I was a true Aveda fan until I received this as a gift.  It leaves my hair so soft.  I have long, thick hair that is wavy and this works wonders!  It also smells amazing!  This is a must buy and try!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really care for either the shampoo or conditioner, at least not for my needs. I have thick, wavy hair. First of all, my hairstylist suggested only washing it 2-3x/week. Secondly, I&#x27;m a WAHM of an infant, and I simply don&#x27;t have the time right now to wash my hair every day. This shampoo smells good and it&#x27;s probably great for someone with dry hair who washes their hair every day. A good wash only lasts me about a day before it gets greasy. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with greasy hair until recently (always dry), so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product at ALL if you have a tendency toward greasy hair. I need something that lasts. I&#x27;ll finish the bottles, since $17+ isn&#x27;t cheap, but I&#x27;ll never buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African American women with extremly thick hair. My hair soaks up moisture and becomes weighed down with certain products. However, THIS product... I LOVE! The conditioner makes your hair extremely soft and manageable. Very great product!</li>
    <li> very original and great product</li>
    <li> I only use Joico products on my hair to keep it healthy, soft and totally manageable.</li>
    <li> My hair just love it. Will continue ordering from here.</li>
    <li> I love this product it left my hair feeling very refreshed and fresh and silky I would def. recommend this product</li>
    <li> These are the best....the smell, the way it cleans, the way it moisturizes.....it&#x27;s just amazing all around.</li>
    <li> $15. Fantastic deal on this fabulous shampoo and conditioner. I color my hair and this leaves it clean and soft. Trustworthy brand.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this system. It is wonderful. I was using the self help program but it was leaving my hair dry. This product has returned moisture to my hair. In addition my hair had broken out and was very thin. It has helped my hair to grow and added strains. my hair has started to thicken up now and it is growing. I use this system while taking biotin and my hair is in so much better condition. I would advise anyone who has thinning or broken or dry hair to invest in this system. I would also add the Joico moisture recovery with this. Works wonders.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Joico products for 5 years, and this is my favorite shampoo/conditioner from them so far. I have super dry and curly hair and this product gives me just the right amount of moisture without leaving my hair greasy. The price is great, buying the same product from Ulta would cost you double.</li>
    <li> The shipping time was great! Product was not what I expected.</li>
