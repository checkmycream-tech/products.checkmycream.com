      <li>I style my hair using \\&quot;Hair Rules\\&quot; products (also available on Amazon.com)</li>
      <li>, I cannot sit under it comfortably.  </li>
      <li>Dryer works great and is sturdy and relatively quiet.</li>
      <li>The visor is made of cheap, brittle looking plastic; let&#x27;s hope it withstands time and usage.</li>
      <li>--- it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Every morning, I get out of the shower, brush my hair to detangle &amp; smooth, make a bowl of cereal, grab my laptop, and go hang out on the chair and eat breakfast and check email, etc.  </li>
      <li>hair is so SMOOTH &amp; SHINY</li>
      <li>Just need to fit it into my bedroom decor somehow.</li>
      <li>I remember my mom using this type of hairdryer in the &#x27;60s, so I am familiar with the design.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
      <li>First of all, I&#x27;m not one to review too many products.  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t need rollers, but I doubt a head full of rollers would even fit under the hood.  </li>
      <li>Dries hair quickly.</li>
      <li>It dries my hair quickly.  </li>
      <li>I do recommend using a bit more product in your hair than you normally when air drying.</li>
      <li>It is soooo quiet and the fact that I can sit practically anywhere and dry my hair is wonderful.</li>
      <li>I love love love my hard hat hair dryer.</li>
      <li>My hair ends up smooth, shiny, and totally FRIZZ FREE!</li>
      <li>That being said, I can not give a true review until then, however, I will relate my first impressions.</li>
      <li>Such a shame as it was easy to install, light weight and strong for my really curly hair.</li>
      <li>The price was right</li>
      <li>I move it around by the lower (thicker) pole rather than the top pole since it is top heavy with the hood and have no problem in moving it from place to another.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get too warm sitting under there, but it does get loud for me, but not obnoxiously loud for anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It fits perfectly over the back of my desk chair, didn&#x27;t need any fussing to use, and dried my 2C hair in about 25 minutes on the medium setting.</li>
      <li>It is everything I expected and more!  </li>
      <li>When I recieved the box, it was pretty beat up with torn edges, making me pretty apprehensive.</li>
      <li>I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who has thick/curly hair!</li>
      <li>It is sturdy and it works exactly as advertised.  </li>
      <li>The air is hot, but not forceful.</li>
      <li>Longer haired people be aware of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more quiet than I though it would be.</li>
      <li>(too hot).  </li>
      <li>all of the noise this unit makes, one would think it is producing heat as hot as the depths of hell.  </li>
      <li>Aftering turning the unit on, it did heat up pretty quickly, and the heat output was decent.</li>
      <li>Hood dyers kind of force you to relax a little (smile).  </li>
      <li>I am very disapointed with this order because the dryer  is  very, very noisy.  </li>
      <li>As noted in other reviews it was very easy to put together with no tools needed.  </li>
      <li>I sit under the dryer for about 20-30 minutes depending on how much time I&#x27;ve got.  </li>
      <li>Dries my hair really fast.  </li>
      <li>I really like this dryer.  </li>
      <li>(like I said, my hair is REALLY THICK).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced as well.</li>
      <li>The materials look  cheap, especially the visor and intake grill cover.</li>
      <li>The opening on the hat is deep and even has a space for a groove to fit in, but the pole does not match that design.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes I don&#x27;t want to leave it because it is so warm in cozy in the morning.  </li>
      <li>Worth it, More shine less frizz!</li>
      <li>Easy set up and a fast dry time.</li>
      <li>I can do my makeup and other things while my hair dries hands free!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It really needs a high fan speed with medium heat.</li>
      <li>If you follow the &amp;#34;curly girl method&amp;#34; and are tired of waiting hours for your hair to air dry, this dryer is perfect for you.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not too expensive. it does what I expected.</li>
    <li> I ordered this dryer on 6/04/13 and recieved yesterday, 6-11-13. I have not used the dryer yet, but I do plan on using it this weekend for a deep conditioning treatment. That being said, I can not give a true review until then, however, I will relate my first impressions. When I recieved the box, it was pretty beat up with torn edges, making me pretty apprehensive. Upon opening the container, I was relieved to see that the unit was well protected and without any damage. The set up was quick, taking me less than 10 minutes to assemble. Aftering turning the unit on, it did heat up pretty quickly, and the heat output was decent. The materials look  cheap, especially the visor and intake grill cover. The visor is made of cheap, brittle looking plastic; let&#x27;s hope it withstands time and usage. I will update this review as I use and if I encounter any issues.</li>
    <li> Excellent - lived up to all the other great reviews!</li>
    <li> Using this hood dryer elongates my curls and helps minimize frizz.</li>
    <li> Pros: Dryer works great and is sturdy and relatively quiet. Its cut my drying time by 15-20 min .&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  I have to give it two stars because I am  5&amp;#34;7&amp;#34; and I cannot sit in a regular chair under the dryer without scrunching down.  Even extended tot the highest position, I cannot sit under it comfortably.  I have curly hair so I don&#x27;t need rollers, but I doubt a head full of rollers would even fit under the hood.  If you live in an apartment- this is NOT the dryer for you as it takes up a lot of space.  If the dryer could extend just a few more inches, , it would be excellent.</li>
    <li> I really like this dryer.  It works great.  I just wished the medium was a little warmer (too cool) or the high was a little cooler (too hot).  I have to flip between the two constantly.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for my daughter.  It is everything I expected and more!  We previously purchased a table top from Sally but it kept falling on her and she was afraid to sit under it.  Well not with this one.  She is only 6 and loves sitting for her 20 minutes.  I would defiantly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. My hair was so straight that I didn&#x27;t have to flat iron it after it was dry!</li>
    <li> My thick, dry, curly hair does not dry as fast as other reviewers reported.  The air is hot, but not forceful.</li>
    <li> Finally I can wash my thick curly hair and not have to stay inside the whole day while it dries. This Babybliss is easy to put together, use and store. I just wonder why I waited so long to have one!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is perfect for my 95 year old mother and me. Easy to move about. Dries hair quickly.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;m not one to review too many products.  Although I do go to the reviews and know how helpful they can be.  I have long, thick, wavy hair and HATE drying it with a handheld dryer.  In fact, I used to only shower at night or if I showered in the morning I used to go to work with wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product after doing tons of research on the best dryer (including reviews, youtube videos, etc.) and am SO HAPPY I did.  It sits in my living room with a folding chair covered by a blanket.  Every morning, I get out of the shower, brush my hair to detangle &amp; smooth, make a bowl of cereal, grab my laptop, and go hang out on the chair and eat breakfast and check email, etc.  I sit under the dryer for about 20-30 minutes depending on how much time I&#x27;ve got.  My ends don&#x27;t get 100% dry because they are too far away from the heat, but they dry up very quickly on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is so SMOOTH &amp; SHINY --- it&#x27;s fantastic.  A co-worker asked me what I&#x27;ve been doing lately differently because my hair&#x27;s so shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get too warm sitting under there, but it does get loud for me, but not obnoxiously loud for anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence because you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of $$$ and be disappointed, I&#x27;d say try it out -- you&#x27;ll love it!!</li>
    <li> Very easy to setup and use.  Rolls around easily.  I dry my long hair on rollers in 20-25 minutes.  Love it!</li>
    <li> The comes very well packaged, but is not black as the description states.  It is white.  That may make a difference to some, but not in regards to the functionality of the product.  Just thought I&#x27;d point that out as another reviewer did as well....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design problem I see is concerning the dryer hat slides onto the pole/stand.  The opening on the hat is deep and even has a space for a groove to fit in, but the pole does not match that design.  The pole is designed to only fit about 1 inch deep into a hole that is about 2.5 inches deep.  There is nothing to lock the hood in place once it is set on the pole.  This leaves the dryer unstable.  My husband &amp;#34;rigged&amp;#34; the top of the pole with padding so that the hat would fit more snugly onto the pole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all of the noise this unit makes, one would think it is producing heat as hot as the depths of hell.  It is a measly 1600 watts in terms of power and puts out an OK amount of heat.  My hair is very short, so the drying time is not impacted by this.  Longer haired people be aware of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed with the design of this product overall, but I will keep it and use it until it is worn out.  I would not recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> I too, have very thick, shoulder length, curly hair. I normally dry with a blow dryer diffuser for about 15 minutes then drive 40 minutes to work with the heater fans pointed at my head. When I get to work, my hair is still a little wet! By about 2 pm it is finally dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I decided to order this. I set it up today (easy) and tried it tonight. It only took 15 minutes at the high setting to get 90% dry. My hair looks great...no frizz. Suffice to say I am very happy with this dryer! Just need to fit it into my bedroom decor somehow.</li>
    <li> The dryer arrived promptly and was incredibly easy to put together- no tools required! There was some minor damage to the box during shipping, but the product was protected inside with thick cardboard molded pieces. It fits perfectly over the back of my desk chair, didn&#x27;t need any fussing to use, and dried my 2C hair in about 25 minutes on the medium setting. It rolls easily and feels very secure. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who has thick/curly hair! It may be too shallow for curlers, but it certainly serves its purpose for me.</li>
    <li> The price was right but it is a little on the short side. The ion is great for hair care</li>
    <li> I hated holding a diffuser on my hair for 15-20 minutes every morning so, after some research, decided to splurge on this dryer and I&#x27;m very glad I did.  I sit under it while I put on my make-up and when I&#x27;m finished my hair is dry.  I use the med and ion settings and my hair turns out frizz free (much better than with the diffuser).  As noted in other reviews it was very easy to put together with no tools needed.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase and highly recommend this dryer for curly hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this to dry my long, thick, naturally wavy/curly hair. I love it! If you follow the &amp;#34;curly girl method&amp;#34; and are tired of waiting hours for your hair to air dry, this dryer is perfect for you. After I apply my product I sit under it for about 25 mins on medium heat. My hair ends up smooth, shiny, and totally FRIZZ FREE! I do recommend using a bit more product in your hair than you normally when air drying. Love it!</li>
    <li> Easy set up and a fast dry time. I am very satisfied. Babyliss products are great for professionals. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I loved it the first time I used it, but it never worked again. Such a shame as it was easy to install, light weight and strong for my really curly hair. Worked only once.</li>
    <li> Nice product . Easy to put together and move around. Dries hair fast with less frizz. Good for when you are in a hurry.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works well but it has a big flaw. It only has 3 settings:&lt;br /&gt;Low fan/no heat&lt;br /&gt;Low fan/high heat&lt;br /&gt;High fan/high heat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last setting, high fan/high heat is almost too hot. The heat is so unbearable that you can only use the setting for about 30 seconds at a time. Any longer and it&#x27;s extremely uncomfortable to sit under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really needs a high fan speed with medium heat. As it is now I have to constantly switch between high fan/high heat and low fan/no heat.&lt;br /&gt;It does work as advertised though.</li>
    <li> I love love love my hard hat hair dryer. i have bleach blond course hair. Its part curly/part wavy and very thick. This is the ultimate diffuser. I sit for about 15 minutes on the ion setting, spritz and scruntch and out of the door. Couldnt live with out  it!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE. I only use it once in a while but when I need it the purpose is fulfilled! It&#x27;s relatively quiet on normal setting and somewhat noisy on HIGH. Clients don&#x27;t feel too claustrophobic inside and it takes up little space in the corner when not in use.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this dryer before purchase and they were so correct.  It was very easy to assemble.  It&#x27;s reasonably quiet.  It dries my hair quickly.  The ion feature works well. It makes my hair very soft.  Only time will tell as to how long the heating element will last.  It&#x27;s reasonably priced as well.</li>
    <li> Dries my hair really fast.  I am following the curly girl method, which means i don&#x27;t towel dry my hair, and without help it takes a long time to dry.  Now it takes less than half the time it used to!  And this dryer is really quiet. I can be in the living room with my husband and he can continue to watch tv while I have the dryer on.  Of course, I love being able to roll it around and adjust the height.  It took me about 2 minutes to put it together, and I&#x27;m not exactly an engineer.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I purchased this dryer. It is soooo quiet and the fact that I can sit practically anywhere and dry my hair is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Worth it, More shine less frizz!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has difficulty holding a hair dryer, due to a medical issue. She has a lot of hair, too, which requires extra drying time. She can pull this dryer up to a chair and use her iPad while she dries her hair. She was a little resistant at first, because she had never seen anything like it. I remember my mom using this type of hairdryer in the &#x27;60s, so I am familiar with the design. It&#x27;s more quiet than I though it would be. It&#x27;s effective and convenient. I&#x27;m grateful to have found this product. Thank you Babyliss and Amazon! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this thing!  Dries my hair in 15 minutes.  Sometimes I don&#x27;t want to leave it because it is so warm in cozy in the morning.  Plus I can check my e-mail while my hair is drying!</li>
    <li> Best drier my wife has ever had.</li>
    <li> I spent a good deal of time researching best ionic hood dryers for home use and my efforts paid-off!  It was delivered to my home in about a week and the assembly was quick and very EASY (no tools needed)!  It was up and running in less than 10 minutes.  I am African-American with short (almost ear length) super thick, kinky-curly hair, so I DEPSERATELY needed an ionic dryer to control the frizz.  I style my hair using \\&quot;Hair Rules\\&quot; products (also available on Amazon.com) and I now have completely dry, shinny, frizz-free, naturally curly hair in 40 minutes on the high setting (like I said, my hair is REALLY THICK).&lt;br /&gt;I use my time \\&quot;under-the-hood\\&quot; to pray, read and plan my day.  Hood dyers kind of force you to relax a little (smile).  I pretend I&#x27;m at the salon or spa when I use my Babyliss.  This dryer is not too noisy either.  Downside:  My receipt of purchase from seller was NOT inside the box (had my husband double-check).  I will call Amazon about this matter.</li>
    <li> Good Hair dryer my wife loves it .she says its the best thing invented since slice cheese.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied  with the hair dryer.  It serves my purpose for home use, and convenience.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and like to let it air dry. Unfortunately, the wet look is not very professional. This saves me a ton of time and dries my hair without frizz. I put it on the Ion On and High settings. I can do my makeup and other things while my hair dries hands free!</li>
    <li> Love this head dryer.</li>
    <li> A bought it for my girlfriend n she loves it, makes her life easy on side jobs and for her too</li>
    <li> This is a very nice hair dryer. I like it because I can move it in different rooms that is very convenient for me and it&#x27;s dry my hair like I wanted to be so I am impressed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about two months since I brought this dryer and I am very glad I did. I searched a long time for a good adjustable dryer that would come down lower enough to cove my head and this dryer does just that. It has two adjustable knobs: one the right that has Ionic on/off switch, on the left it has the heat settings. The dryer does not come on until you pulled the front (clear) part of the hood down which controls on/off. My daughter and I are 5&#x27;1 &amp; 5&#x27;2 and we have no problems with height adjustment which is really great. I move it around by the lower (thicker) pole rather than the top pole since it is top heavy with the hood and have no problem in moving it from place to another. I have no complaints and would recommend this dryer to anyone looking for a well rounded hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I am very disapointed with this order because the dryer  is  very, very noisy.  Moreover, the color is white and I did order a black one and since the shipping is so spensive, I have no choice than trashing this noisy dryer...after all my hearing health is more important.</li>
    <li> I have short, thick, curly hair and live in a cold climate.  I got sick of going out into subzero weather with wet hair, or spending 30 minutes trying to get it dry with a blow dryer.  I bought the Babybliss based on reading many, many amazon reviews of it and competing products.  So far I&#x27;m very pleased.  It was very quick and easy to set up, no tools required.  It is sturdy and it works exactly as advertised.  I use it with the ionic thing on at medium speed/heat and my hair is mostly dry in about 15 minutes, completely dry in 20.  It comes out soft, no frizz, in fact I&#x27;ll probably continue using it once winter is over, because the results are more predictable than when I just let it air dry.  The unit adjusts to varying heights, including low enough to sit on the couch and drink my coffee while it works.  Some people complained about the noise, but it isn&#x27;t any noisier than I would expect from a dryer this size. It&#x27;s quieter than the ones in the salons.  It is white, not black, as some have pointed out, which didn&#x27;t matter to me at all.</li>
