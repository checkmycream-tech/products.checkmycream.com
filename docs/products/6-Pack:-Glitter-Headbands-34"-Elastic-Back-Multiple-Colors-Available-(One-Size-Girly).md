    <li> I was expecting the headbands to look like the picture, they were nothing like the picture at all, very deceiving.</li>
    <li> They look exactly like the picture...super cute. They do slip after a while, but most headbands do on me, so I cannot fault these. The outer part that everyone can see looks great, like something you would find at Claire&#x27;s or Icing but for 1/6 the price of ONE. The inside is canvas, which I plan on adding some velvet too so it will be identical to the slip-proof headbands that I have spent $16 for one. For 6 headbands and free shipping, you cannot beat this deal. I am an accessory junkie and so are my two girls and we have gone through a lot of hair things, these are awesome...especially for $1.20 a piece! For those with negative reviews, maybe I got a good batch or maybe your expectations were too high. I personally do not expect the quality I would receive from a $15 headband for a buck...but that is just me. Oh, and mine are all still in tact, no loose glitter, no broken bands, no headaches. It is hard to argue the negatives in comparison to what I paid!</li>
    <li> Love these!  Very sturdy for my kids&#x27; very thick, almost unmanageable hair!  Love that we were able to choose our preferred assortment and my daughters loved it!</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t care for these head bands because they wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair they are to loose around my hair and kept sliding out.</li>
    <li> Great colors and fast shipping. Quality could defiantly be better, and they could make this so it doesn&#x27;t slip off your head as easily as it does. They work though.</li>
    <li> Bought these as favors for my daughters bday. Arrived on time and was a great value! They look great and the girls Love it!</li>
    <li> they don&#x27;t look the same when you get them in, they are kind of cheaply made, but they shipped fast.</li>

    <li> Who wants to keep a headband for ever any way. My daughter will out grow them by the time they are broken.</li>
    <li> Very nice and beautiful headbands</li>
    <li> Great Headbands, so comfy they fit my head and my 9 year old daughter too. They came in an assortment of colors, not all colors pictured were shipped but that was o.k. with me, I got colors like green, gold, orange, red, blue, and 1 pink zebra print. I would buy again!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter, but they are too big for her head(she is 12). Pretty, but they do not stay on.</li>
    <li> They are nice if you&#x27;re wearing your hair down, but they don&#x27;t stretch enough to go around your hair if it&#x27;s up, and they slide out really easily.</li>
    <li> Daughter got these for christmas and she loves them.  They are bright and colorful fun to wear.  Her favorite one is the blue zebra!</li>
    <li> Love them. They are exactly what I was looking for. Wish I would have bought some more during my purchase .</li>
    <li> Love the headbands because they are very comfortable and they fit perfect! Sometimes the headbands are tight and gives me headaches but these feel great and I have curly thick hair and they dont fall off either! I would recomend these to anyone who loves to wear them all the time like it do and have many styles for many outfits.</li>
    <li> These are really cute headbands.  Lots of sparkle and the variety and colors you get in one package was great.</li>
    <li> Really cute head bands, lots of nice up to date colors too.&lt;br /&gt;Got them for my daughter for Christmas, she really likes&lt;br /&gt;them, and I liked the price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for and these are cheaply made and do not stay in place. I would not recommend anyone purchasing them.</li>
    <li> I really like these there super cute but the&lt;br /&gt;only problem is when you put them on the glitter&lt;br /&gt;part can scrape your head and it hurts. But otherwise&lt;br /&gt;they stay on and are good for sports! : D</li>
    <li> i like them but they break very easily. 2 of them broke first time i wore them. other wise they are good</li>
    <li> nice product  came individually packaged with cute colors my 8 year old .loves them and stated that she will use for soccer games!</li>
    <li> Party favor quality, as in only wear once and then not worth it.  Not for everyday wear.  Really disappointed and not what I expected.  Guess its what I should expect for the price.</li>
    <li> I gave them to my niece for her birthday and she loves them. She wears them all the time. The ones with the stripes are her favorite.</li>
    <li> they were not really what i expected.. they just dont sit on my head the way i like them too but they are very pretty</li>
    <li> they seem cheap. do not like. I would not buy again. this is not what I expected. they don&#x27;t seem to sturdy</li>
