<li> I was soo excited to recieve this product, but once i received it the product quality is completely different than what it shows, not great quality the little stones fell off immediatly very dissapointed.</li>
<li> Mask is of poor over all quality, strap broke first night, and a few nights later became completely detached, mask border is placed to far out making mask itchy.</li>
<li> And the blue plastic eye part is hurtful when you turn your face sideways or down</li>
<li> This ended up looking really creepy and was super scratchy.</li>
<li> However, sadly after only three months of owning the product the straps broke much to her dismay.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t imagine that it broke because of hard use since she only used it to sleep after all.</li>
<li> I this item less than two weeks ago</li>
<li> Then we noticed the blue eyes were so uneven the mask looked ridiculous.</li>
<li> However, I do not like the fact that the tie was already tied making the mask tight when putting it on which makes the mask mash up on your face</li>
<li> and they were all so negative</li>
<li> When I received it, I was shocked by the color.</li>
<li> i was disappointed about that...</li>
<li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all</li>

    <li> I this item less than two weeks ago and the elastic is already breaking. It is very cute but made of poor quality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the closest replica to the sleep mask in the Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s movie. However, I do not like the fact that the tie was already tied making the mask tight when putting it on which makes the mask mash up on your face or maybe I just have a big head, ;)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as pretty as the one in Breakfast At Tiffany&#x27;s    And the blue plastic eye part is hurtful when you turn your face sideways or down</li>
    <li> WHOEVER IT IS THAT DESIGN THESE MASK,  COULD HAVE USED BETTER MATERIALS.  IT IS FLIMSY I DIDN&#x27;T CARE FOR IT</li>
    <li> When I received it, I was shocked by the color. It&#x27;s beautiful! And when I try it on, it&#x27;s comfortable!</li>
    <li> Wife loved mask, But. Mask is of poor over all quality, strap broke first night, and a few nights later became completely detached, mask border is placed to far out making mask itchy.</li>
    <li> its nice and soft to sleep with . cute too. if you sleep with makeup on it will stain it so i would try not to . one of my jewels has fallen off and the strap broke . but i sewed it back on . i used it for awhile before any of that happened though. it is not a replica from the mask in the movie though . i was disappointed about that... but i liked the mask.</li>
    <li> The fact that the eyes were so uneven was a huge disspointment, there is obviously no quality control from this manufacturer. My daughter was so excited to receive this for Christmas because she is a HUGE Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s/Audrey Hepburn fan. Then we noticed the blue eyes were so uneven the mask looked ridiculous. Rather than the hassel of sending them back, we just removed one of the eyes and reglued, but we will not order from this company again.</li>
    <li> My daughter had to have this but I have to say that it&#x27;s not as cute in person as in the picture.  It looks kind of like someone made it at home with some glue.  Sorry I wish I could say more</li>
    <li> Our daughter was delighted to receive this mask as a Christmas gift.  It arrived in good condition and was well made.  I do think the mask could be displayed on a smiling model for the web site.</li>
    <li> This was almost exaclty what I expected, but the golf detail and tie ended up being a little cheap. But it&#x27;s a great replica and the satin on the inside is super comfortable for wearing.</li>
    <li> This ended up looking really creepy and was super scratchy. I couldn&#x27;t use it; and it scared my husband anyway.</li>
    <li> This product first of all looks great. It looks just like the one from the movie and I thought it looked high quality. My girlfriend was thrilled to recieve it as a gift because she is a major fan of the film. However, sadly after only three months of owning the product the straps broke much to her dismay. I can&#x27;t imagine that it broke because of hard use since she only used it to sleep after all. Ultimately I am very disapointed to be let down after I was so excited to find this product.</li>
    <li> I was soo excited to recieve this product, but once i received it the product quality is completely different than what it shows, not great quality the little stones fell off immediatly very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> My daughter asked for this and she was very happy with it! Surprise of the century! She never likes what we get her and this was exactly what she wanted :) TY for a peaceful Christmas!</li>
    <li> The only reason why i bought the mask was becasue my girlfriend was dressing up as Audrey from breakfast at tiffany&#x27;s. She loved it but sadly doesn&#x27;t use sleep masks to sleep.</li>
    <li> when I bought the mask I read the reviews it got and they were all so negative so I was alittle bit worried at first, Im 16 &amp; i love Audrey Hepburn so I had to have the mask! when I got it, it came in perfect condition and I have been sleeping with it ever since I got It, its perfect! definitely reccommend!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It&#x27;s a perfect replica of Holy Golightly&#x27;s mask in Breakfast At Tiffany&#x27;s. It&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
    <li> I personally love my mask! I sleep with my mask every night since i got it. delivery was on time. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all it gets 5 stars!</li>
