      <li>This is by far the best value I have found on bath salts.</li>
      <li>Peppermint is a scent that is not for everyone, but if you love the scent, it is not always easy to find in good bath product.  </li>

      <li>It comes in a sturdy plastic with a Ziploc top for freshness.  </li>

      <li>She is always searching for better bath items.  </li>
      <li>you will be glad you did..</li>
      <li>ok stop laughing...</li>
      <li>we both experience, but they truly do make you feel better  </li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>Perfect for athletes and for those looking for a relaxing bath after a long and stressful day.</li>
      <li>luckily it easily wipes off with a sponge.</li>
      <li>1.5 yr ago I bought the sampler and its still going strong.</li>
      <li>; relaxing yet strong.  </li>
      <li>They have a strong scent of Peppermint (and fainter eucalyptus).  </li>
      <li>The bath salts arrived very quickly and are absolutely fabulous.</li>
      <li>Overall, just a great product.  </li>
      <li>The price is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Salt are very relaxing with a nice aroma that is not at all over powering.  </li>
      <li>The oils are fantastic for your skin, the menthol and peppermint feel heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>And the muscle soak is plain awesome!</li>
      <li>Still a good deal at the current 39.99.  </li>
      <li>so you get the benefit of epsom salts to sooth muscles, but delicious smells and positive results as well from eucalyptus and peppermint essential oils at a high level</li>
      <li>its pretty strong</li>
      <li>This one is great - remember to just use a little bit, as this has a very strong minty smell (which is good, just be careful not to use too much)..</li>
      <li>Just pour a large handful in and enjoy the feel and smell.</li>
      <li>These salts smell fantastic and they really help to soothe sore muscles.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deliveries are always super fast</li>
      <li>product was sent to me by the manufacturer with the request to provide honest, not positive, feedback.</li>
      <li>They are largely responsible for our bath salt addiction;).</li>
      <li>She said it was absolute heaven to bathe with these salts.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Whether you spent the day playing sports, working out, or just chasing kids, it is the ultimate \\&quot;treat yourself\\&quot; and a great gift for the busy person.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product - there are days when we both have very little or no pain after having a nice hot steamy bath with the salts.  </li>
      <li>My wife typically spends more than $500 per year on bath bombs, melts, salts, bubble bath, etc.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>This gives you true results in beating tired muscles but with an even better smell than bubble baths anyway and one that is soothing to your mind and body and aches and pains.</li>
      <li>I used too much the first time and the entire house smelled like mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Chef salts are potent, so you need very little</li>
      <li>For most of last year I concentrated on moving, life changes, and everything other than myself.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Have fibromyalgia and nightly soaks keep me sleeping well and able to get up the next morning with much less pain and stiffness.  </li>
      <li>She used about a cup for our large bathtub, but of course, the strength of the scent is very personal.  </li>
      <li>but it feels cold in the cold lol, but great for the aches</li>
      <li>and I look forward to a nice bath a couple times a week to soak my tired muscles.</li>
      <li>The smell of eucalyptus is so relaxing and when mixed with the hot steam from the bath helps to open my sinus as well.  </li>
      <li>When on sale, I buy directly from the manufacturer as the 20lb bags drop as low as $35.</li>

<li> /&gt;It was what was needed at the time, but getting back into shape and working out daily and pushing myself hard to put even more on my plate that I had dropped means reviving tired aching muscles some of the time as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used a few different varieties of these salts over the last year..</li>
<li> Does not produce any sticky residue like some other salts and oils.</li>
<li> so I go 50/50 with it and some other Epsom ..</li>
<li> They arrived UPS (no doubt due to the weight).  </li>
<li> particular variety leaves a faint tan-colored film around the water line in my tub, even after just one use..</li>
<li> Peppermint is a little overbearing</li>
<li> We have been ordering from sfbs for a few years now..</li>
<li> The salts dissolve immediately, so there is no feeling of sitting on salt (we all know that lesser products don&#x27;t always dissolve, making for an uncomfortable bathing experience).  </li>
<li> Seriously, if it were a thing, we would be competitive bathers ..</li>
<li> I hated baths.... and I am a guy...</li>

    <li> These bath salts have a great fragrance. They also help soothe sore muscles after working out. Love this</li>

    <li> Box was destroyed but product was not damaged</li>
    <li> Very nice but wish spearmint/eucalyptus was available. Peppermint is a little overbearing</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!!  Have fibromyalgia and nightly soaks keep me sleeping well and able to get up the next morning with much less pain and stiffness.  Buy the 20 lb bags 2 at a time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different varieties of these salts over the last year.. This one is great - remember to just use a little bit, as this has a very strong minty smell (which is good, just be careful not to use too much)..

    <li> I heard about Sanfrancisco Salt from my acupuncturist. I have chronic pain and and use Epsom Salt soaks most days.&lt;br /&gt;My acupuncturist is correct. This product is superior to the grocery store version. And the muscle soak is plain awesome! The oils are fantastic for your skin, the menthol and peppermint feel heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;Also customer service is beyond helpful.</li>
    <li> We have been ordering from sfbs for a few years now.. They are largely responsible for our bath salt addiction;).

I didn&#x27;t know chef salts were a thing until sfbs. Chef salts are potent, so you need very little&lt;br /&gt;Almost 1.5 yr ago I bought the sampler and its still going strong.</li>
    <li> I hated baths.... and I am a guy... I take showers... but when my wife asked me to order this I laughed.... not any more... when I smelled the hallway I was intrigued... then I said why not... well now I am looking for an iPad bathtub holder... ok stop laughing... I love this and feel great.</li>
    <li> The bath salts arrived very quickly and are absolutely fabulous. I ordered the Epsom bath salts last time and decided to try the muscle soak salts this time with the aromatherapy smell. These salts smell fantastic and they really help to soothe sore muscles. I walk around 40 miles a week on the trail and I look forward to a nice bath a couple times a week to soak my tired muscles. I am very pleased and would purchase these salts again great value and product.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best value I have found on bath salts. I love that these contain eucalyptus, but they are not overpowering. Perfect for athletes and for those looking for a relaxing bath after a long and stressful day. The bag has a sealing mechanism and is heavy-duty, so storage is no problem. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product.. Can not wait to order more</li>
    <li> SMELLS AMAZING!  The 20 pound bag is a bargain!</li>
    <li> Pleasant aroma. Leaves the body improved.</li>
    <li> Great value for this bath salt. Zip lock bag does not work!!  We purchased a tub side storage jar to avoid spills.</li>
    <li> Truly a relaxing experience.  I purchased this product for myself, but now my husband also uses it.  He has arthritis and I suffer from spinal stenosis and sciatica.  I highly recommend this product - there are days when we both have very little or no pain after having a nice hot steamy bath with the salts.  I didn&#x27;t think that salts would help relieve the pain we both experience, but they truly do make you feel better  We love them!!!</li>
    <li> My wife typically spends more than $500 per year on bath bombs, melts, salts, bubble bath, etc.  Her bath is the place where she relaxes, and is her &amp;#34;me&amp;#34; time.  She is always searching for better bath items.  She spent about $1200 two years ago on LUSH.  In any event, she loves these bath salts.  They have a strong scent of Peppermint (and fainter eucalyptus).  She said it was absolute heaven to bathe with these salts.  Peppermint is a scent that is not for everyone, but if you love the scent, it is not always easy to find in good bath product.  The wife says that her bath smelled so heavenly that she did not want to get out.  The price is fantastic. She used about a cup for our large bathtub, but of course, the strength of the scent is very personal.  The salts dissolve immediately, so there is no feeling of sitting on salt (we all know that lesser products don&#x27;t always dissolve, making for an uncomfortable bathing experience).  We ordered through Amazon Prime and received these within two days.  They arrived UPS (no doubt due to the weight).  Overall, just a great product.  It comes in a sturdy plastic with a Ziploc top for freshness.  My wife will definitely be purchasing these again.</li>
    <li> Great scent; relaxing yet strong.  Makes for a very nice bath...</li>

Essential oils have been shown to hit centers of your brain to actually cause reactions in your brain or block things. In this case, it uses essential oils that are utilized as pain blockers so you get the benefit of epsom salts to sooth muscles, but delicious smells and positive results as well from eucalyptus and peppermint essential oils at a high level that truly, I found, work wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bubble baths give you a warm bath. This gives you true results in beating tired muscles but with an even better smell than bubble baths anyway and one that is soothing to your mind and body and aches and pains. Espsom salts are always used for muscle pain, but this goes a step further&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you spent the day playing sports, working out, or just chasing kids, it is the ultimate \\&quot;treat yourself\\&quot; and a great gift for the busy person. The smell is yummy but not floral so it&#x27;s also a great unisex treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was sent to me by the manufacturer with the request to provide honest, not positive, feedback. I found it both rejuvenating and therapeutic. Just pour a large handful in and enjoy the feel and smell.</li>
    <li> its all good i love it thank you good job..she loves her bath and this works so good..i would tell any one that is looking at this bath salt to get it you will be glad you did..</li>
