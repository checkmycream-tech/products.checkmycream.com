      <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on how amazing my skin looks.</li>
      <li>The Bright Therapy Sonic Cleanser works ok, but it&#x27;s nothing like the Mia.</li>
      <li>Really nice face scrub and gets the grime off.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t have wrapped it properly or nicely anyway.  </li>
      <li>I think it is just as good as the Clarisonic and a lot better value.</li>
      <li>Nice product.</li>
      <li>I think it is easy to use and made my skin feel good.</li>
      <li>Best price for the Noxzema is at Walmart so far.</li>
      <li>The price was right and it works great in the shower.</li>
      <li>They have a better quality feel, nice brushes and use a vibrating motion much more like the Clarisonic.  </li>
      <li>It is a great product, I really want to get another one that works!</li>
      <li>and I am glad I got it instead of the Clarisonic.</li>
      <li>Not over the top, but it does the job.</li>
      <li>:)  P.S.  </li>
      <li>I love the feel of the brushes.</li>
      <li>Love Amazon.</li>
      <li>but the brush is ok.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great face massager even if you don&#x27;t use the massaging head;  very relaxing.</li>
      <li>I was expecting it to be alittle better for the price.</li>
      <li>I have some friends who love the clarisonic, but I did not want to spend that money, with the way my face breaks out.  </li>
      <li>versatility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice product and recommended for safe use on face.</li>
      <li>This product more than met my expectations,</li>
      <li>I love that it comes with a stand</li>
      <li>price is great and the shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>in all, I am positive that there are good cleansing brushes on the market</li>
      <li>They do a very nice job of cleaning and leave the skin feeling very soft.  </li>
      <li>This product was low cost and works great, several attachments and great directions !! ! ! ! ! , !</li>
      <li>The brush works good and makes your skin feel much cleaner</li>
      <li>so i can leave it in the shower for easy access.</li>
      <li>/&gt;PROS: The brush came pre-assembled and the battery cover was easily removed.  </li>
      <li>Using it was easy.</li>
      <li>I have had it for about a month, use it twice a day and still the batteries are strong.  </li>
      <li>I am fine with this because I have a bunch of rechargeable batteries from Costco and the batteries I have in there now have lasted for over 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My purchase also came with a free 4-piece brush replacement set, and the brushes are easy to put on and remove,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I use this for moisturizing, it seems like the cream is absorbed quicker, and I get more of the benefits.  </li>
      <li>I think you have to trust the knowledge of your skin type and don&#x27;t use cheap knockoffs.</li>
      <li>I had heard about cleansing brushes and am happy I finally found one.  </li>
      <li>We tried the Olay Pro X brushes but they feel cheap, spin in a circle like a sander and do not seem to work as well.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes with a clay mask there can be left over parts but this brush did a great job</li>
      <li>Face is smoother, and the body brush made my legs so smooth.  </li>
      <li>but so far so good.</li>
      <li>I have to say that the Ultrasonic Mia is a far superior product, even though it doesn&#x27;t come with pads to apply serums.</li>
      <li>The blue brush really can clean very good, I love it.</li>
      <li>Furthermore, because of the oscillation it is able to clean pores more effectively than any other product on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I feel squeaky clean.  </li>
      <li>My face has never felt smoother or been so clean.</li>
      <li>Most of the reviews were positive and the product itself seemed to everything that I was looking.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The true test for me</li>
      <li>My skin looks better and feels much cleaner.  </li>
      <li>I feel like it gets my face so much cleaner and more exfoliated.  </li>
      <li>Waterproofing makes is really convenient and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
      <li>This sonic brush is VERY comparable to units that cost nearly four times as much (I honestly don&#x27;t notice a difference).</li>
      <li>I bought it on sale, so I&#x27;d say it was worth the money.</li>
      <li>Wow &amp;#34; factor, since I use it more off then on.</li>
      <li>I still scrub with a washcloth first (again, I have really flakey skin at all times from seb derm), and apply my face wash to my face with my hands because I found the brush absorbed it a bit more than I&#x27;d like, but using this brush to really work in the face wash has been amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
      <li>Not a high quality product but still does the job pretty damn good</li>
      <li>My skin feels very soft and smooth after using it.  </li>
      <li>, normally I move it around when I clean my face</li>
      <li>I love this facial brush!  </li>
      <li>( Yeah, I know, that is the whole point right? )</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel soft and clean.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product for the price</li>
    <li> For a knock off this works great!!! Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> Great cleaner.  My skin feels very soft and smooth after using it.  Hearty too.  Dropped it in the shower and still worked!!</li>
    <li> I gave this item to my sister as a gift and she says that she enjoys it, which is great.</li>
    <li> I have used this off and on now for several months. Perhaps, that is why, I have not yet experienced the &amp;#34; Wow &amp;#34; factor, since I use it more off then on. Not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend suggested that I purchase a device like this since she loves hers ( which was another brand ) One thing I don&#x27;t like is even when I begin using it after washing my face, the bristles look so dirty. ( Yeah, I know, that is the whole point right? ) I think they are difficult to clean which goes with the more off then on.  My least favorite is the smooth surface brush for moisturizing. I think it serves no purpose other then to end up looking like a very dirty smooth sponge. In my opinion, it is much easier just to apply it with your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when ordering, I read, that you would get  5 additional brushes with the set, which I never got. I don&#x27;t know if it was false advertising or just simply overlooked.</li>
    <li> I purchased a sonic cleaning brush and got some other brand that was totally different and was missing one of the brushes when I opened it...I sent it back and got a refund...come on amazon you sent me the wrong stuff...again...</li>
    <li> I bought this item at the end of November.  It arrived promptly.  I had read a review on it&#x27;s vibration being too uncomfortable.  I admit it vibrated a little stronger than I anticipated.  Once I got used to it I have loved the results. I have clogged pores on and around my nose.  Since I have been using this brush they are starting to appear clearer.  It&#x27;s a great face massager even if you don&#x27;t use the massaging head;  very relaxing. I love it.</li>
    <li> This product was not what I was expecting, I was hoping that it will be close to expensive ones, but it was just not even close, expensive ones rotate and this just vibrates.</li>
    <li> I expected the cleaning head to rotate. Instead it was a very weak vibrating, and would do little to nothing to clean your face. Spend a few more dollars and buy the name brand.</li>
    <li> I am 60 years old and i use it everyday. My face has never felt so soft. I love it. Would tell everyone to try it. Thank you</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this thing.</li>
    <li> Junk! Brush heads do not rotate, thought it was rechargable and at this price I thought it would have been water resistant.  Made in China, JUNK.  If I could have given it 0 stars I could have. Cannot send back as receipt misplaced. UGH! I was going to save this for my daughter for Christmas, but since it came with extra brushes, I thought that we could share it.  What a WASTE! There is no way it is waterproof, the battery encasement isn&#x27;t rubbersealed, it just slides on and off, YOU don&#x27;t even have to squeeze or depress any button or notch. Sounds like I am whining over 40 dollars, but this mom doesn&#x27;t have 40 dollars to waste. Box looked like it had been dropped and someone had opened the brush heads (extra) box. Couldn&#x27;t have wrapped it properly or nicely anyway.  SOOOOOOOO DISAPPOINTED. BUYER BEWARE</li>
    <li> So just purchased the product a couple days ago. It actually came a day early! I&#x27;ve used it twice and those stubborn blackheads on my nose. Well they are GONE. It also doesn&#x27;t spin so it won&#x27;t damage skin. I have VERY sensitive skin and so far no irritation. I use it along with my simple foaming cleanser and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on how amazing my skin looks. I really recommend it so far. If anything changes I&#x27;ll edit my review!</li>
    <li> After our very expensive Clarisonic brushes quit working in less than 2 years we were reluctant to buy more.  We tried the Olay Pro X brushes but they feel cheap, spin in a circle like a sander and do not seem to work as well.  We then ordered two of the Bright Therapy brushes from Amazon.  They have a better quality feel, nice brushes and use a vibrating motion much more like the Clarisonic.  They do a very nice job of cleaning and leave the skin feeling very soft.  We liked them so much we ordered 2 spares and still haven&#x27;t invested half the cost of a single Clarisonic.  Very happy with these units.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE July 10, 2014:  We have tried several face cleaners but we recently found Noxzema Ultimate Clear Bacteria Fighting creme and it works very well with this unit to clean and smooth your face.  It&#x27;s the Ultimate combo! :)  P.S.  Best price for the Noxzema is at Walmart so far.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to everyone. The only draw back is it is battery powered and not rechargeable. The price was right and it works great in the shower.</li>
    <li> When my Clarisonic fell by the wayside after nearly six years of use, I decided to forgo purchasing a new one, opting instead for BrightTherapy&#x27;s Sonic Cleansing Brush.  Most of the reviews were positive and the product itself seemed to everything that I was looking.  The price tag was basement low and that should have been my first clue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: The brush came pre-assembled and the battery cover was easily removed.  My purchase also came with a free 4-piece brush replacement set, and the brushes are easy to put on and remove,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: I knew prior to purchasing this set that the results were going to be nowhere those of Clarisonic&#x27;s; I didn&#x27;t expect zero results though.  A sonic facial cleansing brush this is not.  Regardless of the brand and ignorant of a low or high price tag, the key factor of a facial cleansing brush is a rotating brush head as that is what rids the face of makeup, clears pores, and gives up a sparkling clean face.  BrightTherapy&#x27;s brush head does not rotate, it apparently &amp;#34;vibrates&amp;#34; (and I purposely put vibrates in quotes as I&#x27;ve yet to see a single vibration.  What in the world&#x27;s purpose of including a sponge applicator for hydration when the brush itself dosn&#x27;t even rotate?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clarisonic had the formula down pat straight from the beginning as not only do the brush heads rotate, they do so in a counter-oscillating fashion that helps to retain skin&#x27;s elasticity.  Furthermore, because of the oscillation it is able to clean pores more effectively than any other product on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am positive that there are good cleansing brushes on the market but this isn&#x27;t one of them, and it will be going back.</li>
    <li> Despite what the advertising says this is not a professional cleaning brush. It did not route and barely vibrates to help open pores. It&#x27;s week and the bristles are useless. If you want a good cleansing brush try a Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> The description for this product says that it is sonic. After opening it I discovered that it was simply a vibrating device with a snap on brush. Nowhere on the box does it mention being sonic. I was expecting a sonic oscillating brush head. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Really would recommend to anyone. With all skin types. I really would not like to live without this product. It is great</li>
    <li> Degunk your face. This little gem may not feel that its doing much. Dont be fooled. After washing my face. I slatther on some cetaphil and used this. In the brush was reminice of makeup. Deff reccomend.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once but so far so good. I think it is easy to use and made my skin feel good.</li>
    <li> this product cleans my face fully, yet it does not pull on my skin.  With the sonic vibrations, I do not have to worry about damaging my face, being 44 it is important not to add extra pulls on my face.  I am also able to use less cleanser and have a cleaner face.  WIN&amp;#62;&amp;#62;WIN&amp;#62;&amp;#62;WIN</li>
    <li> Does not meet my expectations. Barely moves and I see no improvement in my skin. It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for a friend.  It was not the product that I expected.  He hated it.  It is not like the one I previously ordered for myself from the same company.  Very disappointed.  I have purchased many things through amazon.com, but this time I was really disappointed with the product.</li>
    <li> Love it, what a great recommendation! Face is smoother, and the body brush made my legs so smooth.  Will be buying replacement heads.</li>
    <li> After using my girl friends clarisonic I wanted to get one but then I saw this and it less than 1/3 of the price so I took a chance and bought it. This brush works great and I am glad I got it instead of the Clarisonic. I think it is just as good as the Clarisonic and a lot better value. The set included 4 brush attachments heads with a hard brush, a soft brush, a sponge and a massaging head. My skin is pretty sensitive so I mainly use the softest brush and the sponge. These really do make your face cleaner and the open the pores. The face massage attachment feels good but I haven&#x27;t had much time to really use it so I cannot say if it really works to reduce wrinkles. My only complaint, I wish it was rechargeable, instead it requires 2 AA batteries. I am fine with this because I have a bunch of rechargeable batteries from Costco and the batteries I have in there now have lasted for over 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed one Reviewer complained because they thought the brushes should spin.  Thank God they don&#x27;t because this would damage sensitive skin! This brush and the Clarisonic pulsate so they don&#x27;t burn and tear the skin and that&#x27;s why they are called sonic brushes.</li>
    <li> Mine came and would not work at all.  Put it away till after the holidays and then forgot about it...now to late to send it back.  Sadly, out the money for nothing.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this item. You would think by looking at this item, that the brush spins, wouldn&#x27;t you? Well it doesn&#x27;t. So who not make the brush square, so that it&#x27;s obvious that it doesn&#x27;t spin. I didn&#x27;t need to spend the money on what I felt at the time was reasonableprice when this is really a manual brush system. A facial brush is much less expensive. Yes, it vibrates, but so what? I sent it back without even using it. At least Amazon&#x27;s return policy is fabulous. Will continue to shop with them.</li>
    <li> Pretty lame that this item arrived with two of the accessories missing. Must have been a returned item even though it was listed as new. After 1 week I have noticed that is having a positive effect on clearing up acne and blackheads on my chin. I bought it on sale, so I&#x27;d say it was worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have retuned Sonic Skin Care System back since it is operating on the batteries.  The product description did not mentioned this on the website.</li>
    <li> This arrived in a box that looked opened, but I gave it a benefit of the doubt... BAD idea!!! The product was missing parts to it! I sent it back and got a refund because I pay for every piece--- and not for pieces to be missing.</li>
    <li> I have some friends who love the clarisonic, but I did not want to spend that money, with the way my face breaks out.  This product more than met my expectations, within a week you can see a definite difference in my breakouts.  I have fewer zits, and my face feels so much smoother. I love that it comes with a stand so i can leave it in the shower for easy access. I use it twice a day and am loving the results I am getting, even the girl who does my facials has noticed a difference!  A good buy for a good price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used more expensive sonic cleaning brushes before but never bought one because of the high price points. This sonic brush is VERY comparable to units that cost nearly four times as much (I honestly don&#x27;t notice a difference). I do use it in the shower, but I&#x27;m careful not to fully submerge it and haven&#x27;t had any issues with water damage. I would definitely recommend purchasing rechargeable batteries, though. Otherwise, changing batteries a couple times a month is really the only downside.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! Just buy a clarasonic</li>
    <li> I was expecting it to be alittle better for the price. It doesn&#x27;t spin, just vibrate. Actually, it vibrates so bad when I have the sponge on my brain feels like it&#x27;s getting scrambled!</li>
    <li> My face has never felt smoother or been so clean. It really complements my facial soap (Aveeno Daily Cleanser, if you&#x27;re wondering). I recommend it to anyone considering the Clairasonic but does not want to drop the $150 dollar for one. I would definitely buy it again or as a gift for others as it comes in a pretty good looking box and feels more expensive than the $39. Waterproofing makes is really convenient and easy to use.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!  As good as Clarisonic. Brush replacements affordable too! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The brushes are either too soft (you don&#x27;t feel like anything) or too hard (you feel like your face is being scrubbed off).  Either way, the irritated my skin.  I&#x27;ve used a Clara sonic with my esthetician and thought I could use something cheaper based on a dermatologist (I haven&#x27;t see her again) and some reviews I read.  I think you have to trust the knowledge of your skin type and don&#x27;t use cheap knockoffs.</li>
    <li> I almost sent this back when I got it in, thinking I&#x27;d made a mistake buying this instead of the spinning brushes. I have seb derm skin and there are times when scrubbing hard with a rough washcloth can&#x27;t get all the dead skin off my face. I hate returns, though, and decided to give it a shot. I&#x27;m so glad I did! I still scrub with a washcloth first (again, I have really flakey skin at all times from seb derm), and apply my face wash to my face with my hands because I found the brush absorbed it a bit more than I&#x27;d like, but using this brush to really work in the face wash has been amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin really is tighter, cleaner, and clearer. I noticed less blackheads, less acne, and much better makeup application. I thought the firm brush felt too soft to work but it works great. This is so much more effective and less exhausting than what I was doing before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER my order didn&#x27;t come with the lotion brush head. The packaging seemed to not have a space for it so this may be intentional but it obviously implies the order comes with one. Also, I have no idea what the massage head could do for my face but I actually use it sometimes to work cleansing conditioners like Loreal&#x27;s EverCream in the thicker parts of my hair to get it to penetrate to the scalp without having to use too much.</li>
    <li> I keep mine in the shower.  It&#x27;s easier and less messy than trying to do it at the sink.  It makes my skin feel soft and clean.  Just be careful not to press very hard.  Let the brush do its job.  I would recommend this brush.  Also, it was a good price when matched against others.</li>
    <li> I had heard about cleansing brushes and am happy I finally found one.  My skin feels great and my husband noticed a differenced after only a few days.</li>
    <li> I want to return this product.  The description didn&#x27;t say how it is supposed to be charged.  For the price I thought it was charged with electricity but it looks like it is through batteries.  For this much, I can pay some extra money and get one that can actually be charged before it is used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. It is gentle on my skin and I have noticed a marked improvement already. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> really like this product, uesd everyday.  Has really helped my complexion</li>
    <li> Works really good and I got it for a great price.</li>
    <li> Really nice face scrub and gets the grime off.</li>
    <li> Using it was easy. I love the feel of the brushes.</li>
    <li> Looked for facial skin care product for long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the versatility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice product and recommended for safe use on face.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product. I used it for about two weeks and even though it was a few weeks following a facial, I felt my skin was clean and glowing even longer than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My concern is that it isn&#x27;t working now. It seems my &#x27;window&#x27; to return with Amazon is closed, and I can&#x27;t see company info on the packaging. I will try to find something online and will hope the company can help me. It is a great product, I really want to get another one that works! I just don&#x27;t feel I should have to spend $40 again so soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently been having some breakout issues with my skin and since I&#x27;ve been using this it&#x27;s been clearing up and my skin has never felt so great!  The different attachments really help my products penetrate my skin and my skin seems to absorb my moisturizer and products so much better because of it.  I would highly recommend trying this product!</li>
    <li> The brush works good and makes your skin feel much cleaner but I only gave 3 stars because I have to turn it on and hold the button down for it to vibrate. Not a high quality product but still does the job pretty damn good</li>
    <li> This is great, water proof and works well. It vibrates all that gross stuff of your face, you can see it on the brush, it works well, comes with different brushes and small enough to travel with. I have tried a few others, this is gentle, just vibrates not rotating, it has nice heads you can choose from and really works. I think it attaches with magnets but I am not sure, it sure is waterproof though. The batteries had me worried about being waterproof but it is and they last a good long while.  Sonic cleaning is used with teeth, jewelry and large manufacturing companies, because it works well the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The true test for me what putting on a clay mask, letting it dry and get really hard, then I wet my little brush, and put it on my skin, normally I move it around when I clean my face but I thought I would want to see what it did and just held it on my skin. It didn&#x27;t take long before the clay mask was off of my skin and there was none left, that showed me just how well this works. Sometimes with a clay mask there can be left over parts but this brush did a great job and I could see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great and the shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Nice product. I have one by &amp;#34;Oil of Olay&amp;#34; I was looking for something a little bit closer to a &amp;#34;Clairsonic&amp;#34; This was much more like the Oil Of Olay brand. I will be returning it.</li>
    <li> I love this facial brush!  I feel like it gets my face so much cleaner and more exfoliated.  I sometimes would have some flakiness, but this does a great job at getting rid of the flakes and I feel squeaky clean.  I have had it for about a month, use it twice a day and still the batteries are strong.  I do not regret this purchase.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This cleaner works great.  I used to just use water, or my cleaner, and cotton balls, or sometimes a cloth.  With this sonic system, I feel much cleaner, and my skin feels and looks tighter.  When I use this for moisturizing, it seems like the cream is absorbed quicker, and I get more of the benefits.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> it caused a break out, maybe not for me</li>
    <li> Good product. Great delivery time. Arrived as promised. Love Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product was low cost and works great, several attachments and great directions !! ! ! ! ! , !</li>
    <li> Awesome price, and awesome product!  It has all the bells and whistles that the higher priced competitor offers but much less expensive.  My skin looks better and feels much cleaner.  I have recommended it to several friends.</li>
    <li> Not over the top, but it does the job. Not sure what I had expected for the price, but my daughter liked it, so I gave it to her</li>
    <li> The blue brush really can clean very good, I love it. The only bad point is the box looks dirty and old, it doesn&#x27;t look like a new product. but the brush is ok. i have used it over 2 weeks, it feels good.</li>
    <li> I have the ultrasonic Mia, but I bought the Bright Therapy Sonic Cleaner because it had attachments to apply serums.  I have to say that the Ultrasonic Mia is a far superior product, even though it doesn&#x27;t come with pads to apply serums. The Bright Therapy Sonic Cleaner has less than half of the power of the Mia. The Bright Therapy Sonic Cleanser works ok, but it&#x27;s nothing like the Mia.</li>
    <li> Great face brush. The bristles are a little fragile and are stuck down after a few uses but it does the job still. Wish it was rechargeable.</li>
