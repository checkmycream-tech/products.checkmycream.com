      <li>You can build it up nicely.  </li>
      <li>this mascara really is the best I&#x27;ve come across.</li>

      <li>I use this product because it&#x27;s cruelty-free, but it&#x27;s kind of clumpy and doesn&#x27;t go on very smooth.</li>
      <li>The fact that it&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t clump makes it seem perfect.</li>

      <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump or flake like most mascaras.</li>

      <li>the price is more than I like to pay, even though I consider it to have quality ingredients and</li>
      <li>ha ha I love it.  </li>
      <li>If I find out it is formulated with better ingredients I would purchase again.</li>
      <li>So many pluses that would allow me to overlook the cost of the product if not for the flaking that is an irritant.</li>
      <li>This is one reason I love tarte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve tried over a hundred mascaras in my life. Every time a new drugstore brand comes out, I give it a shot. I&#x27;ve tried samples from all the big department store and designer brands as well. Water-proof, smudge-proof, it didn&#x27;t matter - I always ended up hearing the words &amp;#34;racoon eyes&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m not sure why I even tried this product, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier that I did. The fluffy brush fills in my sparse lashes and the formula lasts! I&#x27;ve never had it smudge, flake or run despite swimming (and yes, crying) in it. I&#x27;m also a contact wearer and I&#x27;ve never had a bit of irritation. I use Make Up Forever&#x27;s eye makeup remover and a silicone pad with bristles (Sephora makes one) and the mascara removes cleanly without taking any lashes with it. After applying, I make sure to dust under my eyes with a setting powder and I&#x27;ve never noticing any smudging even over oil-based concealer and foundation. I&#x27;m blown away by this product and can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s natural formulation or great price. Try it note and thank yourself!</li>
    <li> goes on without clumps.  Makes my skimpy lashes look great!</li>
    <li> This is a great mascara.  It gives great coverage and is &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; -</li>
    <li> Not tested on animals and works great.</li>
    <li> Let me say this: I don&#x27;t wear makeup. I&#x27;ve tried so many and here I am turning 30 and still don&#x27;t wear makeup 90% of the time my entire life. I don&#x27;t because even when it says for sensitive eyes/skin or oil-free/good for acne prone skin, etc. I break out more or my eyes water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only mascara I can tolerate through most of the day. My husband can tell when I&#x27;m wearing it because he says my lashes look longer and thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reasons I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars is 1. the price is more than I like to pay, even though I consider it to have quality ingredients and 2. I have used cheaper, less natural brands that gave a much, much fuller and longer lash appearance.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the good reviews but I am not a huge fan. It does come off easily when you wash your face but I am getting a lot of clumping. I normally use Dior Show Waterproof and bought this as a more daily mascara. I don&#x27;t see any benefit to my lashes from using this either. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again and I would return it if I didn&#x27;t wait so long.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to find propylene glycol and other chemical constituents in this.  For some reason I thought I was getting a more naturally made produce.  Will not buy again - packaging is beautiful.</li>
    <li> I totally LOVE this mascara! Makes my lashes look fuller, thicker, longer and stays on without smudging. I will purchase again when I run out.</li>
    <li> It okay, nothing special...way too expensive for the effect.</li>
    <li> Unbelievably beautiful case!!  And does it ever work!!  Long silky lashes at last.</li>
    <li> The packaging is nice, but I&#x27;m the kind of person who values content more than packaging.  I guess my lashes are too thick, I don&#x27;t know, but the product clumps too much and eventually gives me raccoon eyes.  I can find better things to do than to constantly check my makeup so I quit using this item.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Clumping. Cost $20. I&#x27;m going back know to my Cover Girl nonclumping $7</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this mascara (natural, love the bottle) but it&#x27;s clumpy... You have to be very careful when applying it and brush the clumps away. Once it&#x27;s on it looks pretty good but the fact that it takes quite a lot of effort to put it on makes me use it very rarely.</li>
    <li> Nice mascara and i like that is doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of crap in it</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this mascara as it was highly rated and paraben free. however after a week of using, i have had dark circles and raccoon eyes every day. it goes on easily, and definitely lengthens which is a plus. however, i really don&#x27;t like the constant darkness that its causes. i have never had issues like this so not sure if its a give and take for a paragon free product. i&#x27;ve tried to go all organic with cosmetics and this was the first mascara i tried without parabens. i&#x27;ll continue my search! while i do appreciate tarte making this product it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> Best mascara I have ever used and does not irritate my eyes even when wearing contacts.</li>
    <li> Rich, dark mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump and goes on smooth. I love that the seller included a handwritten note thanking me for my purchase!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about this mascara when I first tried it.  It was very wet, which I know sounds funny, but it was.  After a week or two, it dried out a little and thickened a bit and I am very happy.  The formula is incredibly pigmented.  It is super black.  You can build it up nicely.  I have never had an issue with it flaking off or smudging during the day.  I love this mascara and I will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> First time buying a more expensive natural mascara. I normally get Loreal , got Lancome in the malls before.. And this looks great on. Even my husband noticed a difference and said my lashes look nicer. :) I will be buying Tarte from now on!</li>
    <li> Fantastic Mascara! I have medium length lashes and a lot of volume in them whenever I use any mascara. However, my problem with most mascaras that I use don&#x27;t make my lashes look longer-or even very noticeable because they have really light colored tips.  This mascara both makes my lashes look much more voluptuous and it creates the length I was looking for! It creates a natural look that really enhances your lashes without it looking like you&#x27;ve used to much! I&#x27;ve used tons of expensive mascaras, but this by far is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Great mascara, no smudging and stays on all day.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Typically, half way through the day, my eyes are black underneath from masccara; however, Tarte&#x27;s Gifted mascara does not flake or rub off during the day. Easy to apply and remove. Fullest lashes ever!</li>
    <li> Finally have found a natural mascara that isn&#x27;t wimpy and wipe off after 30 minutes!!!</li>
    <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I use this product because it&#x27;s cruelty-free, but it&#x27;s kind of clumpy and doesn&#x27;t go on very smooth. I have to do a lot of extra work to get on a smooth coat of this.</li>
    <li> I love this tart mascara. I have tried many other organic ones in this one is by far the best in every aspect.</li>
    <li> This mascara is amazing, I have always loved it. It arrived very quickly after ordering and was exactly as pictured/described. It doesn&#x27;t make my lashes crunchy and it actually separates them and holds a curl while adding volume and length. I use Tarte MultiplEye eyelash primer under this for the best effects. Will continue to buy this mascara until they stop making it, I haven&#x27;t found anything I like better!</li>
    <li> The mascara feels heavy and sticky.  Every time I put it on, my eyes get irritated, kind of a burning sensation, although it did not smear.  Also, after about three months the mascara was dried out although I only used it maybe ten times.</li>
    <li> i love this mascra, not clumpy, not too black, goes on smooth, make your lashes look thickr and i am allergic to a lot of mascaras, this one contains no fibers which i love.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a vegan mascara and had heard lots of good things about this one. My lashes are a but darker and fuller, but there was almost no length added on. And the whole tube seemed a bit... dry? It only lasted maybe a month. Guess I&#x27;m still searching...</li>
    <li> I cannot believe all of the good reviews here. Number one, if you wear concealer, this mascara smudges into the concealer looking like racoon eyes. You cannot take a nap in it at all! Hard to wash off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara!  I have tried many &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; mascaras that have clumped and flaked. Used properly, this does not!</li>
    <li> Mascera has been a problem for me. My eyes burn when I wear it. I have tried every hypoallergenic gluten free brand I could find . This is the first mascera I&#x27;ve ever used that looks good, wears well and does not hurt! I recommend this highly and with full confidence.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite mascara of all time.  If you apply it right (waiting until the previous coat is dry) it does make your eyelashes pop and they&#x27;re not clumpy! LOVE LOVE LOVE TARTE!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kinda pricey but when I add all the other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried and wasn&#x27;t satisfied with, this is a bargain! I get compliments on my lashes, never did before. Goes on easy, washes off easy, doesn&#x27;t smudge. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Delighted to finally find an excellent mascara product that is safe, does not clump and removes easily.&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to trying other products by this company.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at Sephora, but it&#x27;s the same product as this one on Amazon (which I&#x27;m about to purchase here now that I know Amazon has it). My lashes fall out or break almost daily with mascara use. My eyes are easily irritated too - my lashes constantly itch when wearing makeup and traditional makeup removing wipes (Neutrogena) cause rashes. I used this mascara and experienced no lash fall out. It flakes a little, but I will take flaking over smearing or lash breakage! Within a few weeks, my lashes were softer and seemed fuller and my eyes were never irritated. I don&#x27;t think the mascara made them fuller, but because the mascara didn&#x27;t cause my lashes to fall out, I think my healthier lashes were able to grow naturally. This mascara and Dior&#x27;s mascara are the only kinds that prevent my lashes from breaking or falling out but I prefer this one because it has natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have used this mascara and like it (especially because it is natural), but will not buy online anymore.  The product came with the top cracked and dried out.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Stays put all day long without flaking or sliding off. Clumps just a bit, but not as bad as most.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara.  I was looking for a mascara that dried quickly but wasn&#x27;t waterproof.  This was the perfect combination! Great color and I love the bottle, too.</li>
    <li> Best ever! I don&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> Be careful wearing this near an oven. I was making cookies and opened the oven door to take them out and the air that rushed out fried a big chunk of my eyelashes off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s so expensive here. You can buy it at Sephora for $20 or right on the Tarte site for $20. Anyway, I wanted a mascara that was not goopy or clumpy. If I put one coat on, then it&#x27;s for work where I don&#x27;t want to look like a trollop and have the stuff running down my face on a hot day. I can put more on if needed but this is so natural. This mascara fits the bill. The fact that&#x27;s it cruelty-free totally sealed the deal for me. I don&#x27;t need to look for mascara anymore.</li>
    <li> I threw out all of my L&#x27;Oreal mascaras when I learned that the ingredients are pretty nasty.  Found out that Tarte mascara has much safer ingredients.  I used to be strictly a waterproof mascara user because I couldn&#x27;t stand the look of mascara running down my face.  (I live in a humid climate).  This mascara is my new favorite!!  It&#x27;s not waterproof, but it doesn&#x27;t smudge like some others and the lash definition is really, really great.  Much better than I was expecting. In fact, I like how this mascara colors and separates better than my old L&#x27;Oreal favs.  What I do sometimes though is put this non-waterproof formula on my upper lashes and then use the waterproof equivalent on my lower lashes...especially if I&#x27;m going to an event like a wedding, funeral, church etc...  I wish I would have discovered this mascara a long time ago...</li>
    <li> Yeah, so I&#x27;m not sure about this one. Absolutely gorgeous packaging in a wooden tube too pretty to discard. The mascara flakes, though, which upsets my contact lenses. It goes on easily, stays on reliably well with no coon eye consequences, and it removes incredibly well and without drama. I think my lashes have been healthier since I&#x27;ve used it, too. So many pluses that would allow me to overlook the cost of the product if not for the flaking that is an irritant.</li>
    <li> Hands down best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. I don&#x27;t wear a whole heck of a lot of makeup, but I love a full-lash look. I had recently purchased &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34; mascara, which I loved at first, but then discovered it, was was destroying my eyelashes, so I then purchased this one. For being non-waterproof, and non-fiber it stays on really well, even after 12-hour night shifts. I find the brush easy to use and apply to my lashes without smudging all over my eyelid (like with It&#x27;s So Big). Lashes are now restored, and always look amazing, full and long after each time using it. I never get &amp;#34;bad mascara days&amp;#34; with this one.  I hope they never stop making it, because it is worth every penny. and I will continue t purchase it.</li>
    <li> This is the best.  No bad &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; to irritate your eyes and coats the lashes so nicely they seem a lot longer and thicker.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe what a difference I see in my eyelashes! I am officially converted! I used to use MAC and while it was great, I love this mascara so much more!!</li>
    <li> This mascara dried out very quickly and was clumpy. I like other Tarte cosmetics because they wear well and are cruelty free.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s more expensive than drugstore  products, but it&#x27;s so worth it.  This mascara goes on smoothly, rarely clumps, lengthens my lashes, never feels stiff, and comes off pretty easily -- when it&#x27;s supposed to!  I don&#x27;t always end up with raccoon eyes after the gym!  I&#x27;m fair complected with dark blonde hair and green eyes, and previously, I had preferred the more natural look of a brown mascara, but this black is striking, and I think it looks fresh. PLUS there&#x27;s the wonderful fact that the company is eco-sensitive and does not test on animals.  And the cool bamboo case.</li>
    <li> This mascara makes your lashes thick and long and doesn&#x27;t seem to flake off or smudge during the day.  I have noticed a bit of clumping on the lashes that I have to smooth out, but that&#x27;s what you get with mascaras that make thin lashes look very thick.  Other than that, it is a perfect mascara! .</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! It was even better when the product dried up a little bit! But it gave me extremely lush lashes!</li>
    <li> This mascara, when applied correctly, will really lengthen your lashes and last all day long.  It does not smudge or smear and believe it or not, it&#x27;s not all that difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> I bought this from Macys ( I had a gift card) after reading that it did wonders for lashes AND it wouldn&#x27;t irritate senstive eyes. I have tried it for a few days and I will say it doesnt seem to bother my eyes BUT I cannot tell the difference between this and my Almay &amp;#34;Get up &amp; grow&amp;#34; Mascara. For the amount of money I paid for this Tarte masacra, there is no way I would purchase it again. Today I did my left eye in my usual Almay and the right in Tarte - NO difference. They aren&#x27;t longer looking or fuller or anything, Dont waste your money.</li>
    <li> I got this for a family member but unfortunately she did not care for it. She said that it smudged easily and clumped.</li>
    <li> By far, my favorite mascara ever!!!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. I am working on weeding out all of my old cosmetics for more healthy options and I found this mascara to be the best I have tried. I love all Tarte&#x27;s mascaras but appreciate all the natural ingredients in this one.</li>
    <li> This was one of the better Mascaras I&#x27;ve had, it feels soft and creamy and makes your eyelashes full. HOWEVER, it dried out in about 3 weeks. I applied it 2 or max 3 times each week. I have long and full eyelashes and I apply mascara mostly on the tips of my eyelashes, so I was unpleasantly surprised when it dried out in 3 weeks... Or maybe mine was defective... who knows? but still for the price, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again thinking it may dry out quickly.</li>
    <li> I would definately order this again! It makes my lashes inky and spider-like, almost as if I were wearing false eyelashes. It does not smudge and it washes off very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a quick update: I was at a drugstore and I bought a mascara that boasted collagen and volumising (yes, I am a slave to marketing!  ) I took this brand home and tried it.  Yuk! It was like black water on my lashes. I am still using the Tarte and will never stray again.....maybe...</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara!  Delivered quickly &amp; it was boxed, despite the description saying its not.</li>
    <li> Love this natural mascara...very dark and beautiful. Compares to Chanel with no chemicals!</li>
    <li> It defines and does not clump and looks great!  Both my daughters used mine up and now I am back for more!</li>
    <li> I like it.  Am glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara in the world it makes my lashes look like fake ones they&#x27;re so long! No other mascara does this, and I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara.  It doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water the way the more expensive brands do.  Nice lashes!</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite mascara. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, covers my lashes completely, and doesn&#x27;t flake. It lasts all day and washed off without a mess. Love it.</li>
    <li> Saw this item on qvc and Amazon had it a bit more affordable. I like this item but would not buy again just because it was just like any other mascara but more expensive.</li>
    <li> My fav mascara. I have tried so many. This is all I wear now. Goes on easy, comes off easy. Sometimes it drys up, I put some water on the brush and it perfectly fine again.</li>
    <li> I got this mascara in a kit with Tartes&#x27; primer and bb cream.I had purchased the kit mainly to try their bb cream because I wasn&#x27;t really looking for a new mascara because I have been using Benefits&#x27; They&#x27;re Real mascara for sometime now but needless to say when I tried this mascara I was amazed.It went on so smooth,no clumps,very lengthening,and it lasted!So now I have two favorite mascaras and I will be purchasing the full-size of this mascara ASAP!I recieved beautiful results with this mascara and it&#x27;s one I will use for years to come.</li>
    <li> Finally an organic mascara that actually works. I love it so much I went back and ordered 2 more. I love that it goes on smooth. Easly washes off but it also stays on all day. The bamboo tube it comes in is also a cute unique little bonus.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite mascara!  My super-sensitive eyes are not bothered by it at all, and switching to this has really helped dial back the chronic redness I always deal with. One less thing aggravating the issues!  It thickens well and holds up for as long as I need it to.</li>
    <li> I love tarte products.  The mascara was very nice however I don&#x27;t think it was worth the price.  Love their foundation and some of their lip glosses.  I haven&#x27;t done my homework with their mascara to know how natural it is.  Trying to stay away from chemicals as much as possible.  If I find out it is formulated with better ingredients I would purchase again. Some of the cheaper products work just as well, however what&#x27;s  in them?</li>
    <li> This is probably my all time favorite mascara! My lashes look great and I only have to put one layer on. Love it.</li>
    <li> A little hard to remove, but great results for me. Not much clumping, no flaking for me, and good daytime coverage. A note: I don&#x27;t like to wear heavy makeup.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this mascara. The fact that it&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t clump makes it seem perfect. Unfortunately, this mascara  smudges below the eyes by mid morning...won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this product. I&#x27;ve tried tons of different mascaras at every price point and I am extremely picky with makeup.  this mascara really is the best I&#x27;ve come across. It has an amazing rich pigment that really makes lashes stand out, great brush that doesn&#x27;t cause clumping, and it stays in place (no smudging/flaking)). I will add that I have sensitive eyes and am a contact lense wearer. many mascaras seem to cause irritation when I have my contacts in -- no discomfort/irritation with this one!</li>
    <li> To be fair, I used it for months before I decided it was not for me.  It flaked all over the place.  I really need a waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem finding a mascara that didn&#x27;t make my eyes itch or make them water. This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever found! I love that it&#x27;s a natural product. It doesn&#x27;t run or smear after it&#x27;s dried (even if it does get wet). It also makes my lashes look twice as long. Great product! I would definitely recommend to anyone who has sensitive eyes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a total product junkie and I probably buy a new mascara every couple months but this one might be the best one I&#x27;ver every used. I read about it in an interview with celebrity make-up artists who gave names of products they couldn&#x27;t live without. I was  also intrigued by the natural leanings of the brand. It&#x27;s definitely exceeded all of my expectations.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different natural mascaras and they never worked well for me.  This mascara does everything, it lengthens and thickens lashes, it doesn&#x27;t rub off, or even come off when I&#x27;m crying from laughter (a true test!).  It does come off with just water, but  it stays on very well otherwise.  The best!</li>
    <li> Great product that doesn&#x27;t flake off and truly is waterproof.  Removes easily with eye makeup remover.  I use Balm products eye makeup remover.</li>
    <li> Screw fiber mascara just buy this</li>
    <li> My go to mascara as of late. Love that it is natural and has no harmful chemicals or irritants.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  Recommended by a friend and so thankful she did...  I just recommended to another friend.  Had been searching for a new mascara and finally found THE one!</li>
    <li> I love Tarte Cosmetics.  This mascara makes your eyelashes stand out. I also like their lights camera lashes. Helps lashes to grow.  This is better than Bare Minerals volumizer by far.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. Stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
    <li> I have had a terrible time finding a mascara that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, is gluten free,and still make my lashes noticeable. This one does the trick! So far, best Ive ever used. It lasts a long time, and comes off at night fairley easy. I don&#x27;t think this is a 100% natural/organic product, I need to research the ingrediants.</li>
    <li> This is literally the only mascara that I&#x27;ve been able to wear for years without an allergic reaction. I love it! I just wish it was waterproof...</li>
    <li> Tarte does make great make up. I have bought the waterproof and camera ready mascara and love it, and I was expecting something more with this one. It has a dark black color, but it really just colors the lashes and does help thicken or lengthen. I still love Tarte blush and powders. I still use it but I only gave 4 stars because I was expecting it to lengthen too.</li>
    <li> Ever since I bought this my friends and family think I purchased the add on false lashes.  ha ha I love it.  This product is amazing, I put all my false eyelashes to &amp;#34;sleep&amp;#34; in a drawer, will never need now.</li>
    <li> Love the fact that its organic, and I do like Tarte products, however, this did not last very long before it really started irritating my eyes, so I am disappointed. It does really thicken and lengthen your lashes, and it is a little easier to remove than some of the other Tarte mascaras, but I don&#x27;t think I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This tube is dried out. I will not re-order from this supplier.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive/allergy-prone eyes and this mascara does not bother them.  Was thrilled to find a second source to purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara.  It makes your lashes longer and thicker and it lasts all day.  I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I am constantly looking for the best mascara; I&#x27;ve tried a multitude of different types, but am always disappointed. I just received this mascara in the mail and I am totally pleased! My lashes are so much longer and fuller, and not clumpy at all. This mascara gives you an elegant, classy look (which is always a plus)! Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! I have severe allergies and it doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes like many mascaras do.</li>
    <li> Wet and clumpy, produced a lot of F words while I was trying not to get wads of color stuck between my lashes. I don&#x27;t have long lustrous lashes, kind of short and thin, so the clumping was a pain. I love this company though and I&#x27;m not at all soured on their products.</li>
    <li> was a bit clumpy which probably only means it was old compared to what I usually purchase at the local store.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. I wish the tube lasted longer, but since you only need to apply it once, its worth it.</li>
    <li> I only buy cruelty free products. tarte is one of the few companies is TRULY cruelty free. Many companies that claim they are cruelty free are owned by parent companies that test on animals or sell in China where animal testing is required by law. This is one reason I love tarte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have the lights, camera, lashes mascara but this mascara is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. It makes my lashes SOFT. I can&#x27;t believe how soft they feel with this on. It doesn&#x27;t clump or flake like most mascaras. It separates the lashes nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Heads up ladies, it is only $20 on the tartecosmetics website!! This is the best mascara I have ever used. Does not clump at all and really lengthens!</li>
    <li> This mascara is very light but at the same time adds so much body to my lashes. Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> The best mascara I have ever used.it creates long and THICK lashes</li>
    <li> I love mascara, and I probably own every kind ever made.  I&#x27;ve also never been 100% happy with any kind that I&#x27;ve ever bought.  Until I bought Tarte&#x27;s Amazonian Clay mascara.  This is truly the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  It goes on super easily, doesn&#x27;t clump or flake, and is the perfect dark black color.  I love, love, love it, and I will keep buying it! :-)</li>
    <li> I have researched many mascaras that do not have chemicals such as parabens and have used Tarte&#x27;s Lights Camera Flashes in the past. This mascara was ok; it went on smoothly, didn&#x27;t clump, and came off fine. However, I believe I got a stye on my eye due to this mascara only about 3 days after starting to use it. The stye broke open and I gave me a bacterial infection in my eye (cleared up fast though). I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I like this mascarra but the formula is identical to the physicians formula (green tube) love the formulation but for the price I&#x27;d rather buy a drugstore one. Won&#x27;t rperchase or recommend</li>
    <li> Ok, Im still trying to find the perfect mascara.  IM allergic to a lot of stuff, so I was praying I didnt get any allergic reaction, and Im happy to say I didnt.  So far I like it, enhances my eyelashes nicely.  The previous one I used started nicely too but with every day use it dried out very fast.  Ive been using this one for 3 weeks so far and it works fine. Lets give it some more time and I will determine if I continue my journey or if I finally find &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;.</li>
