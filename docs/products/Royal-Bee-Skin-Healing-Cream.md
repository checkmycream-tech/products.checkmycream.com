      <li>I would have gladly paid much more for it...</li>

      <li>I first found this cream at a farmers market.</li>
      <li>but it won&#x27;t be the first</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it states.</li>
      <li>her jar looked just exactly like this one....</li>
      <li>therefore have no option but to write this honest review and warn other customers about the smell.</li>
      <li>hahahahaha  </li>
      <li>and I could stop at her other flea market and pick up more of this cream.....</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to everyone.  </li>
      <li>Immediately soothes and speeds up the healing of sunburns, regular burns (pretty much on contact),</li>
      <li>It works like magic on extremely dry skin that nothing else even remotely helps... and fast!  </li>
      <li>that look that old or older....</li>
      <li>I bought this as it seems very natural...</li>
      <li>my month old cut was disappearing before my eyes.....</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m 66 years old with gardeners hands</li>
      <li>I was wondering if mine was old it was runny.....</li>
      <li>I admit it was past 30 days, but I explained that I was busy with an elimination test due to a very severe allergic reaction I was dealing with, so did not even get to try the cream for more than 30 days.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My sons have dry skin and this really does help.  </li>
      <li>If the skin is irritated, there might be a mild burning sensation for a slight second.</li>
      <li>I said \\&quot;I study natural healing...and help others to heal different ailments, naturally...\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 63 year old male and even my dermatologist commented how well my skin looks now.</li>
      <li>my old dry feet were as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom</li>
      <li>And my old month old dry cut...</li>
      <li>and as we talked I looked down at my cut and it was softening just in that 2-3 minute time frame and going from snow white and hard to kind of milky clear and soft...and the back of my hands where she had rubbed a little of the cream were plump and much younger looking than they were just a couple of minutes ago..</li>

<li> BUT it has a perfume that in not natural (to me)</li>
<li> but I DID put this on that little spot several times that next day...</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think I can buy it on a regular basis due to the price.</li>
<li> dry winter skin</li>
<li> but they WERE looking much younger and much less wrinkled...</li>
<li> so she dabbed the &#x27;dried cut&#x27; with this very same Royal Bee Skin Healing Cream...</li>
<li> I DO have a little cut that won&#x27;t heal and it&#x27;s 4 weeks old and dry and hard and crusty...</li>
<li> Also, a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
<li> I just happened to have a little place about 1/4 of an inch long where I had cut my finger about 4 weeks ago and</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m really not interested...</li>
<li> BUT washing DID NOT remove the smell nor the extreme irritation to my nose!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Do you have a scratch or very rough</li>
<li> For the price it is not worth it.....</li>
<li> saying \\&quot;YOU are SUCH a SUCKER for a</li>
<li> At the motel I showered and just put a little dab of that cream on from head to foot and jumped in my jammies...By the time I got in to the mirror in the other little alcove of the motel room where the sink was....I gasped and yelled for my husband to come and look....</li>
<li> I have also noticed that the batches can sometimes vary slightly in color and in smoothness.</li>
<li> It is slightly runny (as per another customer&#x27;s review), but it is never greasy.</li>
<li> so let&#x27;s see what your little miracle cream will do for IT...</li>
<li> a little dab will make a difference beyond your wildest dreams......</li>
<li> I plan to give away a little of what we bought...</li>
<li> just take a little dab and give it a try\\&quot;....</li>
<li> After using this skin healing cream daily for a few months, you cannot tell I ever had the tough scaly, flaking forehead.</li>
<li> and my few wrinkles were plumping</li>
<li> seller is not customer oriented and has denied me returning this very expensive product that I absolutely cannot stand and have not used.</li>
<li> , well this is ridiculous...</li>
<li> You will not be sorry -</li>
<li> expensive but</li>
<li> I was skeptical but decided to give it a try.</li>
<li> so crazy pricey!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product is absolutely awesome!  It went above and beyone my expectations.  It is one of the best skin creams I have EVER used.  I will ALWAYS use this from now on.  I would highly recommend this to everyone.  You will not be sorry - in fact, you will be elated!</li>
    <li> I bought this as it seems very natural... it feels wonderful on the skin, no problem there... BUT it has a perfume that in not natural (to me) and I cannot stand it.  When I put it on (just the once) I could not sleep and had to wash off ... BUT washing DID NOT remove the smell nor the extreme irritation to my nose!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seller is not customer oriented and has denied me returning this very expensive product that I absolutely cannot stand and have not used. I admit it was past 30 days, but I explained that I was busy with an elimination test due to a very severe allergic reaction I was dealing with, so did not even get to try the cream for more than 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I therefore have no option but to write this honest review and warn other customers about the smell. I am sure that not everyone is as sensitive to smells as I am, but just in case you are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Louella</li>
    <li> I first found this cream at a farmers market. I was skeptical but decided to give it a try. It does exactly what it states.I use use it all over with feeling sticking. Super important in the Florida humidity. Very nice cream but a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> My sons have dry skin and this really does help.  I also use it for my hands and occasionally on my face.  The problem is the price.  I don&#x27;t think I can buy it on a regular basis due to the price. I&#x27;ll buy it on occasion.</li>
    <li> This is great cream because I think its all natural but so crazy pricey! Its very nice to use on my very dry hands. Definately a splurge!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe this contains anything special at all - kind of amazing given the price. It isn&#x27;t a particularly good moisturizer either.</li>
    <li> Wonderful cream. Love it 😊</li>
    <li> I love Royal Bee. I have been using it for about 5 years, and had lost my source to buy it, so I was delighted to find this seller on E-Bay. I was very pleased with the fast shipment of my order, and the efficient way in which it was handled.</li>
    <li> Originally bought this at a flea market in Florida.  This is the best healing and softening cream ever.</li>
    <li> A friend had used this product and liked it - She suggested I try to find it on-line.&lt;br /&gt;Good product!</li>
    <li> I started using this after having to do a chemical peel on my forehead for pre-cancerous skin. I am a redhead and burn easily. After using this skin healing cream daily for a few months, you cannot tell I ever had the tough scaly, flaking forehead. I&#x27;m a 63 year old male and even my dermatologist commented how well my skin looks now.</li>
    <li> I discovered it while on a roadtrip from NYC to Mississippi. I was in the Carolinas.  It saved me during that roadtrip on the backroads and in life in the big city of Brooklyn:  Immediately soothes and speeds up the healing of sunburns, regular burns (pretty much on contact), dry winter skin (oh! the relief!), bug bites (pretty much on contact), even embarrassing things like mild hemorrhoids.  It is slightly runny (as per another customer&#x27;s review), but it is never greasy. If the skin is irritated, there might be a mild burning sensation for a slight second. It goes away as quickly as it came. And you will literally feel the healing effects soon thereafter.  I have also noticed that the batches can sometimes vary slightly in color and in smoothness. These things do not affect the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> Best cream in the world. You can use it for your face or body.</li>
    <li> When I ordered cream I assumed it would be a solid cream I was wondering if mine was old it was runny.....I that is the case I would not order it again. For the price it is not worth it.....</li>
    <li> This is my second jar.  I love that has no chemicals.  Also, a little bit goes a long way.  The smell is very pleasant.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this very same product last week at a Flea Market in Deland, Florida.  I was passing the booth and the lady called me in to hear her speel...I said \\&quot;I study natural healing...and help others to heal different ailments, naturally...\\&quot; but we are on vacation and I&#x27;m really not interested...and I don&#x27;t buy anything without researching...and everybody&#x27;s &#x27;product&#x27; sounds good....blah blah blah  But she called to me again and said, \\&quot;No WAIT!!!  Do you have a scratch or very rough/dry skin on your hands...just take a little dab and give it a try\\&quot;....I just happened to have a little place about 1/4 of an inch long where I had cut my finger about 4 weeks ago and that rascal just would NOT heal..It was solid white/dry/crusty...and no matter what I had put on it ... it just would NOT go away...So I walked back to her and I said, \\&quot;Yes as a matter of fact I DO have a little cut that won&#x27;t heal and it&#x27;s 4 weeks old and dry and hard and crusty...so let&#x27;s see what your little miracle cream will do for IT...so she dabbed the &#x27;dried cut&#x27; with this very same Royal Bee Skin Healing Cream...her jar looked just exactly like this one....We talked just a minute and I was laughing about being talked into trying her product...and as we talked I looked down at my cut and it was softening just in that 2-3 minute time frame and going from snow white and hard to kind of milky clear and soft...and the back of my hands where she had rubbed a little of the cream were plump and much younger looking than they were just a couple of minutes ago..and I&#x27;m 66 years old with gardeners hands that look that old or older....but they WERE looking much younger and much less wrinkled...my month old cut was disappearing before my eyes.....SO I said \\&quot;OH my GOODNESS, well this is ridiculous...but I&#x27;m going to take a jar of your cream and I&#x27;ll probably be wishing I had my money back later today but it won&#x27;t be the first time\\&quot;...my husband was laughing and walking away...saying \\&quot;YOU are SUCH a SUCKER for a SOB story\\&quot; hahahahaha  But I bought the cream and we wrapped up in the flea market and got in the car and headed back to our motel...At the motel I showered and just put a little dab of that cream on from head to foot and jumped in my jammies...By the time I got in to the mirror in the other little alcove of the motel room where the sink was....I gasped and yelled for my husband to come and look....Now I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles...I&#x27;m not big on makeup...but I&#x27;m BIG on skincare and I take good care of my skin...but my pores were closing and my few wrinkles were plumping and we both laughed....my face was literally looking younger within a minute or two of putting the cream on....Next morning...my old dry feet were as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom and I had only rubbed a dab of this cream IN and put socks on....I looked in the mirror and my face still looked dewey and much younger after only one use of this cream the night before....So I said to my husband...I have GOT to call this woman (she had given me her card) and see if we can come to her house and buy more of this cream.....Turns out she was going to be at the Market At Marion flea market just out of Ocala on Friday and we were heading home that day....so my husband said we&#x27;d just cross over to the middle of the state and head home up I 75 and I could stop at her other flea market and pick up more of this cream.....We did and I bought FIVE JARS at $21 each...but let me tell you something...after using it just that once...I would have gladly paid much more for it...and I would have STILL bought 5 jars...This stuff is miraculous...a little dab will make a difference beyond your wildest dreams......so YES YES YES...I would buy this product in a heartbeat....and at this price...worth every penny and more.....And my old month old dry cut...it totally disappeared within 24 hours..TOTALLY disappeared...but I DID put this on that little spot several times that next day...I just can&#x27;t say enough good about this product...FINALLY something that does what it SAYS it will do...But now listen...I know people..and I know there are people that will buy this product and curse me and MY review because they say it didn&#x27;t work for THEM...but I ALSO know there are people that if you hand them one million dollars...they will complain because you didn&#x27;t hand them one million and ONE...I plan to give away a little of what we bought...but I will absolutely be ordering more soon...I&#x27;m going to be doing a review of the product on my blog next week also...that&#x27;s how much I loved it.  [...]</li>
    <li> This cream is truly a Miracle Cream for Face&amp; Body.  I Love it!!</li>
    <li> This skin cream is a must have!  It works like magic on extremely dry skin that nothing else even remotely helps... and fast!  Also calms the associated itch/burn.  Just love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I love this cream made from natural organic ingredients. Smells good can use it anywhere on face, hands, legs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs easily and does not leave any greasy sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems expensive but well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoshi</li>
