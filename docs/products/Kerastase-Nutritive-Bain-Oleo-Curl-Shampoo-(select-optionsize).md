      <li>Did not see any difference in the so called &amp;#34;curl definition&amp;#34; in fact I think it made my hair more of a frizzy mess.</li>
      <li>It cleans well but isn&#x27;t high in detergents so it doesn&#x27;t harm my color-treated hair.</li>
      <li>I am over age 50 and not apt to swoon just because a shampoo lathers well and smells nice.</li>
      <li>Keeps them soft and wavy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money spent.</li>
      <li>With that said, it lasts a loooooong time if used sparingly and not that much is needed each hair washing (and I have very long hair).</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this: subtle yet expensive and elegant.</li>

<li> there were two deep burns on the bottle where the lot number and a &#x27;not for resale&#x27; marking had been partially removed by using a sharp, hot, tool to burn partially through the plastic, but the markings were still legible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> I have somewhat dry, curly hair.  </li>

<li> A little goes a LONG way.</li>
<li> You only need a small amount.</li>
<li> I do NOT love its price and the long waits to get it in hand when ordering onlne.  </li>
<li> I am now using all of these products on my thick, coarse hair.</li>
<li> I returned it because I considered BURNS on the plastic bottle as as defect, Amazon refunded me less than half of what I paid.</li>
<li> So it&#x27;s definitely not worth the price for me!</li>
<li> I was having a hard time with dull, dry, and frizzy hair.</li>

    <li> Great product.  My son has super curly hair and it has helped with texture and curl</li>

    <li> I was having a hard time with dull, dry, and frizzy hair. I went through all of the top drug store and some salon brands and finally had had enough, and dropped the cash on this and it&#x27;s conditioner counterpart. I love the smell of this: subtle yet expensive and elegant. My hair is back to fabulous and getting compliments all the time again.</li>
    <li> I bought a product that I expected to be a retail item, not something that someone had taken a soldering iron to..there were two deep burns on the bottle where the lot number and a &#x27;not for resale&#x27; marking had been partially removed by using a sharp, hot, tool to burn partially through the plastic, but the markings were still legible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I somehow think that this compromises the integrity of the bottle itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I returned it because I considered BURNS on the plastic bottle as as defect, Amazon refunded me less than half of what I paid.</li>
    <li> I&#x60;m a huge fan of Kerastase products, and this shampoo is one of the reasons why. It&#x60;s light, yet cleanses thoroughly. A little goes a LONG way. It never ceases to amaze me how long one of these 8 oz bottles will last, and I have VERY long, curly hair. I give Bain Elasto-curl a TEN.</li>
    <li> What can I say...I was expecting magic and I got &amp;#34;meh.&amp;#34; Maybe my water quality is to blame, but I always end up with dry, brittle, unruly hair after using this shampoo. So it&#x27;s definitely not worth the price for me!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  I am now using all of these products on my thick, coarse hair.</li>

    <li> Arrived sealed and quickly. This product works very well and is a must have. You only need a small amount. It&#x27;s worth the money spent. The scent is very unique and I get compliments often on my hair. I will order again. This bottle size lasts about 6 months for me.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!! I&#x27;ve been using Kerastase for over 5 years... and its the best!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any \\&quot;curl definition\\&quot; as it states. My hair wasn&#x27;t any smoother, moisturized, or defined. It smells nice. It didn&#x27;t dry my hair like a cheap hotel shampoo would. But it didn&#x27;t do anything that it claimed it would.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the greatest for curly hair. Keeps them soft and wavy. You don&#x27;t have a lot of the shampoo for maximum results.</li>
    <li> Great hair product. I have somewhat dry, curly hair.  This brand always have good stuff. I am sure most people will like it.</li>
