      <li>Just an outstanding product</li>
      <li>Great for high humidity areas.</li>
      <li>Sure helps my fine hair look a lot fuller and keep its shape</li>
      <li>Tried many other hairspray&#x27;s this one was The best hold of a hairspray I have ever used!!</li>
      <li>Best hair spray for the extreme hold I need during work.  </li>
      <li>and it came very quickly when ordered with no express mail.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not over-priced like so many special products are.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad scent &amp; many women would probably like it --</li>
      <li>Light but keeps hair looking fuller.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is soft, smells nice, and works wonders on my aging, baby fine hair.</li>
      <li>Keep wipes available for quick clean up.</li>
      <li>I have used many hair sprays and since my mother owned and operated a beauty salon I have pretty much seen most hair sprays on the market.</li>
      <li>I tried every \\&quot;super hold\\&quot; hair spray, mousse, pomade, you name it,</li>
      <li>This hairspray is amazing for fine, limp hair - just spray on and lift hair with afro comb where volume is needed :)</li>
      <li>Best holding and long lasting hair spray ever!</li>
      <li>I will never be switching from this brand, well worth the money.</li>
      <li>I have thin hair, and all of the Fat Hair products are wonderful!  </li>
      <li>it comes in with twist open/close cap, but I couldn&#x27;t finish using the can because the scent is too powerfully perfumey.</li>
      <li>This hairspray offers a great hold and actually volumizes your hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and most hairsprays make it appear wet and sticky, not this one.</li>
      <li>Great product for those of us who have thin, fine hair..</li>
      <li>Your hair also remains soft to the touch and brushes out easily.</li>
      <li>When my beloved Sebastian Shaper Mega Hold was discontinued and replaced by the vastly inferior Shaper Fierce, I went on a quest to find a new hairspray that didn&#x27;t give me helmet head, but could give some hold and body to my fine, blonde hair.</li>
      <li>it does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
      <li>In fact, I&#x27;d go so far now that I have used it for about a week, to say that I prefer it to my original Sebastian.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works.</li>
      <li>It also holds very well.</li>
      <li>It is far worth the price.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s too much for me.</li>
      <li>but then again I am very fussy with my sprays and this has passed the test for me.</li>
      <li>So much so that I have chased it all over the Eastern coast line.</li>
      <li>This spray really holdshair well in all sorts of climates.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than any other product I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>Truly works for my fine long hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only product I have used that actually DOES give my fine, stick-straight hair body!</li>
      <li>Good hold last all day and does not look stiff.</li>
      <li>I have tried lots of other hairsprays, but this one, by far is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>that didn&#x27;t cost a gazillion dollars, and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that holds my heavy hair out away from my face and head, providing much needed relief, and it looks a whole lot better, too.</li>
      <li>after much hype in advertising, I paid the inflated price for this product which is just a very sticky hairspray that left split ends when combed out and did not do ANY of the advertised volume, fulness or shine.  </li>
      <li>Strong enough to freeze your hair (it will not move) but not get it all gunky like other products.  </li>
      <li>(I have medium/thick straight hair), gives me lift and comes in a bigger bottle.</li>
      <li>I liked the hairspray itself, it gives good volume and stays throughout the day, but the smell is awful.  </li>
      <li>I have curly hair, and a lot of it, but it&#x27;s silky and just lays on my head in a hot, heavy blanket.</li>
      <li>Living in Florida with high humidity, this is the only one that keeps down the friz.  </li>

<li> Thirdly, if you weren&#x27;t careful, Shaper M can move toward helmut head.</li>
<li> I have spent well over $100 on hairspray, trying to find something that even came close.</li>
<li> if you know what Carolina Herrera perfume smells like, this is similar (spicy &amp; heavy on gardenia) --</li>
<li> My curls now stay in well over 24 hours and minimal amount of spray is needed.</li>
<li> I always have to use this in conjunction with other hair sprays.</li>
<li> I often opp for curls all round and a full fringe has always been impossible for me due to my cow licks.</li>
<li> Also, it will not run down your head when you start to sweat.</li>
<li> is not sticky and does not load your hair down.</li>
<li> half the price that they charge at the Walgreen</li>
<li> I use it as a base to give me a ton of volume, then hold that volume with Rusk W8less Strong hold.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s reliable but also a little crunchy.</li>
<li> The Samy Fat Hair Hair Spray is too sticky, harsh on the hair, and does not add volume.  </li>
<li> Yes it&#x27;s quite heavy and sticky whilst drying, but what would you expect?</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been through every hair spray, firm hold, ultra hold...</li>
<li> I have quite thick and ultra straight hair with two infamous cowlicks on either side of my fringe.</li>
<li> So no easy comb through.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s an intense spray to be used sparingly but it does hold when weather conditions or bad hair days require it.</li>
<li> Very (very) firm hold.</li>
<li> For one thing, it&#x27;s way less expensive.</li>
<li> When they do, they are stiff, difficult to brush afterwards, or make my hair so coatd that I feel I need to wash it after every use.</li>
<li> Helps to make my thin hair look fuller.  </li>
<li> That gets irritating....</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Finally found something after 30 yrs that gives my this hair fullness. magic.</li>
    <li> I LOVED this hairspray &amp; even loved the can it comes in with twist open/close cap, but I couldn&#x27;t finish using the can because the scent is too powerfully perfumey. It&#x27;s not a bad scent &amp; many women would probably like it -- if you know what Carolina Herrera perfume smells like, this is similar (spicy &amp; heavy on gardenia) -- but it&#x27;s too much for me. I walked around with some women one day wondering who was wearing gardenia perfume until I realized when I was alone that the scent was coming from my hair! Needless to say, I wasn&#x27;t able to use it anymore after that (I tried, but I can&#x27;t tolerate it).</li>
    <li> Too sticky for my type of hair.</li>
    <li> The Samy Fat Hair Hair Spray is too sticky, harsh on the hair, and does not add volume.  I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Smells yummy, holds hair solidly (I have medium/thick straight hair), gives me lift and comes in a bigger bottle. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the nozzle clogs constantly, so I have to remember to rinse it after every use. That gets irritating....</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd or 4th can.  Sure helps my fine hair look a lot fuller and keep its shape</li>
    <li> I have curly hair, and a lot of it, but it&#x27;s silky and just lays on my head in a hot, heavy blanket. I tried every \\&quot;super hold\\&quot; hair spray, mousse, pomade, you name it, that didn&#x27;t cost a gazillion dollars, and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that holds my heavy hair out away from my face and head, providing much needed relief, and it looks a whole lot better, too. Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, so I have to order it online.</li>
    <li> Tried many other hairspray&#x27;s this one was The best hold of a hairspray I have ever used!! It will hold a hairstyle all day.</li>
    <li> Good hold last all day and does not look stiff. You can comb through your hair and it will still hold.</li>
    <li> Very (very) firm hold. It&#x27;s reliable but also a little crunchy. So no easy comb through.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair, and all of the Fat Hair products are wonderful!  This spray really holdshair well in all sorts of climates.  Great for high humidity areas.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an intense spray to be used sparingly but it does hold when weather conditions or bad hair days require it.</li>
    <li> Love it- the only spray I&#x27;ll use!</li>
    <li> This hairspray offers a great hold and actually volumizes your hair. It is far worth the price.  My wife and I use it daily. It&#x27;s better than any other product I have ever tried. Strong enough to freeze your hair (it will not move) but not get it all gunky like other products.  Also, it will not run down your head when you start to sweat. Just an outstanding product</li>
    <li> Best holding and long lasting hair spray ever!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. Gives great volume.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, good price, great holding hair spray!</li>
    <li> I have tried lots of other hairsprays, but this one, by far is my favorite.  I have thinning hair and this gives me the boost that I need.  It also holds very well. Living in Florida with high humidity, this is the only one that keeps down the friz.  Love this product! I even keep a bottle at my daughter&#x27;s house-due to airline restictions-so I am never without it!</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE ONLY HAIR PRODUCT THAT KEEPS MY HAIR IN SHAPE EVEN IN A WINDY DAY, I USED IT TO MAINTAIN MY HAIR STYLE FOR LONGER TIME</li>
    <li> Truly works for my fine long hair.</li>
    <li> Great product for those of us who have thin, fine hair..this stuff works.</li>
    <li> after much hype in advertising, I paid the inflated price for this product which is just a very sticky hairspray that left split ends when combed out and did not do ANY of the advertised volume, fulness or shine.  felt gypped!</li>
    <li> Light but keeps hair looking fuller. Excellent</li>
    <li> I have used many hair sprays and since my mother owned and operated a beauty salon I have pretty much seen most hair sprays on the market. This one is by far the best for holding hair and making your hair look fuller.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite hair spray. Holds but doesn&#x27;t feel like a helmet.</li>
    <li> i love itmy hair looks sooooo great with it&#x27;s the best sprayi&#x27;ll always buy fat hair</li>
    <li> I adore this hair product ! So much so that I have chased it all over the Eastern coast line. I have used thousands of hair sprays that say they increase the volume of the hair. When they do, they are stiff, difficult to brush afterwards, or make my hair so coatd that I feel I need to wash it after every use. But not Samy&#x27;s ! I found it many, many years ago, and find this is the best product ever,&lt;br /&gt;and it&#x27;s not over-priced like so many special products are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is soft, smells nice, and works wonders on my aging, baby fine hair. I would use it for a regular  hair spray, even if I didn&#x27;t need it for a root lifter or volumnizer. It is a superb root lifer ! I urge everyone to try it.</li>
    <li> I always have to use this in conjunction with other hair sprays. I use it as a base to give me a ton of volume, then hold that volume with Rusk W8less Strong hold.</li>
    <li> When my beloved Sebastian Shaper Mega Hold was discontinued and replaced by the vastly inferior Shaper Fierce, I went on a quest to find a new hairspray that didn&#x27;t give me helmet head, but could give some hold and body to my fine, blonde hair. I have spent well over $100 on hairspray, trying to find something that even came close. Shaper plus, Elnett, Chi, Bed Head, and finally Samy&#x27;s Fat Hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the only thing that can even come close. In fact, I&#x27;d go so far now that I have used it for about a week, to say that I prefer it to my original Sebastian. For one thing, it&#x27;s way less expensive. Secondly, it smells like candy. Thirdly, if you weren&#x27;t careful, Shaper M can move toward helmut head. I have not had any problem with heaviness using Fat Head. So Yay!</li>
    <li> I discovered Fat Hair products by accident.  Now I&#x27;ll never use anything else.  It&#x27;s the only product I have used that actually DOES give my fine, stick-straight hair body!</li>
    <li> This is great hair product -  it is long-lasting , and to it&#x27;s quality will recommend to everyone.  Shipping has been fast - and the customer service has been great.  Thank you.  Suada</li>
    <li> Love it.  Helps to make my thin hair look fuller.  Great hold.</li>
    <li> half the price that they charge at the Walgreen and it came very quickly when ordered with no express mail.</li>
    <li> I have quite thick and ultra straight hair with two infamous cowlicks on either side of my fringe. I often opp for curls all round and a full fringe has always been impossible for me due to my cow licks. I&#x27;ve been through every hair spray, firm hold, ultra hold... But nothing worked. I bought this on a whim and I&#x27;m so glad I did. My curls now stay in well over 24 hours and minimal amount of spray is needed. Yes it&#x27;s quite heavy and sticky whilst drying, but what would you expect? I now don&#x27;t have to worry about wind or rain messing up my hair. I will never be switching from this brand, well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I liked the hairspray itself, it gives good volume and stays throughout the day, but the smell is awful.  I am going to return this product because of that.  But if you don&#x27;t mind the smell, I think it&#x27;s a good hairspray for fine hair that needs volume.</li>
    <li> Hair spray that holds!</li>
    <li> This hair spray is awesome.  If you want your style to stay, buy it. If you want to add volume, buy it. Your hair also remains soft to the touch and brushes out easily. Holds like gum on a shoe...lol, however, it also leaves residue on sink counter, walls that can be felt to the touch.  Keep wipes available for quick clean up. Excellent product</li>
    <li> This hairspray is amazing for fine, limp hair - just spray on and lift hair with afro comb where volume is needed :)</li>
    <li> i like this product alot.  it does exactly what it says it does.  holds you hair all day and then some.  is not sticky and does not load your hair down.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY hairspray I have found that works ! I have fine hair and most hairsprays make it appear wet and sticky, not this one. This holds my hairstyle in place. Best hairspray on the market!</li>
    <li> Best hair spray for the extreme hold I need during work.  Short bursts to the roots and fluffed before the final comb works well, also.</li>
    <li> I love this spray because it makes it easier to style my hair and it stays in place all day.  It gives your hair a thicker appearance as well.  I do use my regular spray along with it but then again I am very fussy with my sprays and this has passed the test for me.</li>
