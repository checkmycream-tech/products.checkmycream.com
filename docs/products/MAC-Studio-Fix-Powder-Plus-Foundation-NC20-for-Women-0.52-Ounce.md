      <li>The Present was the perfect primer to use with this instead of</li>

      <li>I will most defiantly order from them again.</li>
      <li>i would definitly recomend and will be purchasing when im done with this review. :)</li>
      <li>Here, now everyone can look for themselves :)     [...]</li>
      <li>Many powders can make your face look cakey and oily, the studio fix powder is very different; it makes your skin look flawless just like a celebrity&#x27;s make up would.</li>
      <li>original.&lt;br /&gt;Muchas gracias y saludos desde Venezuela :)</li>
      <li>I just love mac foundation and how it looks on my skin</li>
      <li>There is another compartment on the bottom holding a sponge as well as a mirror in the inside top lid.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>and hopefully it will work out even better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had more sun since ordering.</li>

      <li>I use this brand for years already, and this is one that I like the most.</li>
      <li>Love MAC products.</li>
      <li>Almost every women can relate to make up because they all use it, so why not use something that you will love from the start.</li>
      <li>so any one is able to use it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Studio Fix is definitely the best foundation/powder combo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>REALLY LOVE BUY IN THE AMAZON.COM</li>
      <li>Better than drugstore products and got a good deal on Amazon but still searching for a better match for my large pores and shine by the end of the work day.  </li>
      <li>With such a perfect canvas, it was easy to make blush look like it should, and not like I&#x27;m having a fever or embarassed.</li>
      <li>After searching for a long time for a good product, many women say that the MAC studio fix powder, is by far the best \\&quot;two- in-</li>
      <li>The makeup washed off easily when it was time to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>One thing this powder is GREAT for is coverage...which is good, because after using this for a few days, my face broke out and has been a train wreck ever since.</li>
      <li>but so far so good- if you can be diligent about the way you use the sponge or brushes when applying and try not to introduce waters or oils that can counteract the awesomeness it should be ok</li>
      <li>If you have not tried this product yet, I strongly urge you to.</li>
      <li>MAC easily smooths out my uneven skin tone with a flawless finish.</li>
      <li>Lastly when you purchase this, you&#x27;ll feel great knowing that you can have a portable powder and foundation in your purse at all times.</li>
      <li>May as well buy a cheap one at the grocery store for $3.</li>
      <li>It essentially looked great, just shiny</li>
      <li>Yeah this is quite bizarre indeed.  </li>
      <li>It essentially looked great, just shiny</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t like liquid foundations, or I&#x27;d try MAC&#x27;s Studio Fix Liquid version, which I hear is 100% mineral-oil free.</li>
      <li>It is light and natural-looking.</li>
      <li>Many celebrities use MAC&#x27;s merchandise because they love how it feels on their skin and after a long day it still looks nice.</li>
      <li>This powder is very good at giving a women full coverage and doesn&#x27;t clog any of your pores like other powders may do.</li>
      <li>first of all mac doesnt come with mirrors on the top of the package.</li>
      <li>Not overjoyed but not hugely disappointed either.</li>
      <li>It goes on great and lasts for a long time.  </li>
      <li>But on a good note, I&#x27;m loving the Philosophy product under foundations that are more drying than the Smashbox, it&#x27;s a whole other animal from the Smashbox BB Cream.</li>

      <li>REAL GENUINE MAC MAKEUP WILL NEVER EVER HAVE THE ACTUAL POWDER ON TOP, AND ANOTHER COMPARTMENT FOR THE BLOTTER/BRUSH</li>
      <li>Not only is this great for everyday use, it looks beautiful when wearing it to parties.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but maybe i had a tan at the time; okay my skin is VERY oily and i feel that at first the powder does make your skin look flawless BUT within an hour it is running down my face and leaving creases, smearing, and just looks a wreak!</li>
      <li>Just some crinklage starting in the eye area, I try to take good care of my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it wasn&#x27;t true.</li>
      <li>so if you don&#x27;t use them that quickly you may want to op for an in store purchase.</li>
      <li>and they got here very fast!</li>
      <li>This product feels very light on the skin and looks very natural too.</li>
      <li>Bare Minerals did feel light-weight on my face and was nice for summer, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Once again it was flawless, but with the BB Cream as a primer it was not dull and matte, it had a little shine to it.</li>
      <li>She said that she bought one before and it stayed very long with good quality.</li>
      <li>They cake up really fast and easily.    </li>
      <li>Then using the Real Techniques Buffer (wanted to try it, and it&#x27;s fabulous, not as dense as the Sephora)real</li>
      <li>and second if u want tp buy maac get it off maccosmetics.com and the reviews that say it is amazing.</li>
      <li>(The Present, apply foundation, light misting of De-Slick) made the appearance of the makeup much much better.</li>
      <li>(The Present, apply foundation, light misting of De-Slick) made the appearance of the makeup much much better.</li>
      <li>I used the Sephora Mineral brush (my absolute favorite for powder foundations)SEPHORA COLLECTION Classic Mineral Powder Brush #45</li>
      <li>&quot; Yeah lady I know how I look right now.</li>
      <li>Still a good product in comparison to buying directly for mt he MAC store, I&#x27;ve been lucky in that respect since I&#x27;ve been trying to save some money in buying them from a 3rd party online.</li>
      <li>studio fix powder is a powder and a foundation combined in one and is very easy to apply, rather than going through the hassle of applying liquid foundation and then later applying a matte powder, the studio fix powder is a one-step application.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ve been spending too much money on products that don&#x27;t work, you&#x27;ll love how the studio fix powder is within a reasonable budget and how much coverage you can get from applying it once a day.</li>
      <li>For more coverage, I powder on a little more and it never gets cakey.  </li>
      <li>Some may argue that this powder makes your face oily and it feels heavy on the skin, but many women love this product and they use it all the time.</li>
      <li>We all know who Kim Kardashian is, she is one of the many celebrities that uses this product on a daily basis and she uses it for a lot of her photo shoots.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> After trying out a bazillion and one low to high-end foundations, I just keep coming back to MAC Studio Fix.  For a lighter feel, I powder on a dusting.  For more coverage, I powder on a little more and it never gets cakey.  Overall, my ultimate fave!</li>
    <li> Studio Fix is definitely the best foundation/powder combo I&#x27;ve ever used. It goes on great and lasts for a long time.  It has great coverage. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years now, ever since my aunt introduced it to me. If it made you break out so severely then you might have been allergic to an ingredient in it or something because I&#x27;ve never had that problem.</li>
    <li> ok so fake mac. first of all mac doesnt come with mirrors on the top of the package. and second if u want tp buy maac get it off maccosmetics.com and the reviews that say it is amazing. they r lame bc they dnt kno this is fake seriously its obvious. i woodnt buy this because u dont kno what it is made out of. so get it of their actual online store or go to a store. or counter</li>
    <li> I did use this product and the coverage is awsome but the truth is after 3 days gave me a breakout and my skin is not like oily and stuff, The tone is NC 20 for me, do you know any other brand that I can get the same tone and coverage?  Please let me know, my advise to you be careful with this.</li>
    <li> SOME OF THE MAKEUP ON THIS SITE SAYING THEY ARE \\&quot;MAC\\&quot; ARE FAKES!     REAL GENUINE MAC MAKEUP WILL NEVER EVER HAVE THE ACTUAL POWDER ON TOP, AND ANOTHER COMPARTMENT FOR THE BLOTTER/BRUSH ETC!!!    PLEASE BE CAREFUL PEOPLE!    YOU THINK YOU ARE BUYING MAC BUT THEY ARE FAKES!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the products I received and they got here very fast! I also loved the professional-looking note that came in my package. I will most defiantly order from them again. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as descibed by the seller. It was in perfect condition and was undamaged. i would definitly recomend and will be purchasing when im done with this review. :)</li>
    <li> I have used MAC Studio Fix for 9 years. It is light and natural-looking. It blends well with my skin and never causes any break outs. In fact, on lazy days or on outdoorsy vacations where make up is not on my list of priorities, I can go days without wearing it. I have noticed a difference between wearing the MAC and going without it: my skin breaks out less when I WEAR the Studio Fix. I have uneven skin tone, with very red cheeks. When I am not wearing make up I have been told that I look as though I have just cried. MAC easily smooths out my uneven skin tone with a flawless finish. I have combination oily/dry skin and never have to reapply during a long work day. No other foundation I&#x27;ve tried has held up to that challenge. If you have not tried this product yet, I strongly urge you to. I am confident you will be thrilled with the results!</li>
    <li> This powder/foundation is the best color match I have ever found, plus it has great coverage without being too matte/heavy, when applied with a good-quality, natural hair powder brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love MAC products, usually, just not this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it contains mineral oil, probably in very high concentration. Every time I use it near my chin and nose, I break out, badly. The rest of my face gets red and itchy, too. I&#x27;m apparently allergic to mineral oil, and when I stopped using this makeup, the breakouts stopped, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to a synthetic brush at first, thinking that the natural animal hair was the problem, but it didn&#x27;t help. I switched to Bare Minerals, trying to get a more natural product with the same coverage as this makeup offered, but that didn&#x27;t work, either--that brand is too sheer and the color match just wasn&#x27;t as good as MAC. Bare Minerals did feel light-weight on my face and was nice for summer, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like liquid foundations, or I&#x27;d try MAC&#x27;s Studio Fix Liquid version, which I hear is 100% mineral-oil free. the reason I don&#x27;t like liquid foundations or concealers, is because they&#x27;re harder to take with you and apply when you&#x27;re on the go, or can&#x27;t get in front of a mirror somewhere to see what you&#x27;re doing. I&#x27;m on the run and also travel a lot, and I wanted one thing that was easy to pack, that I can carry with me in a coat pocket or very small purse, that works well, and isn&#x27;t outrageously expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any suggestions/good alternatives to this one, ladies?</li>
    <li> I HATED THIS PRODUCT IT WAS FACE MAC PRODUCTS THAT ARE REAL DO NOT COME WITH A BRUSH AT THE BOTTOM THEY COME WITH A SPONGE   YUCK I SPIT ON THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I recieved this product in record time. It was packaged nicely also. for the price you couldnt beat it. I have heard many great things about mac makeup. It goes on nicely. I think I should have gone a shade darker. I&#x27;ve had more sun since ordering. I like it. I think Im use to a heavier powder but I&#x27;m trying new stuff. I am ordering a primer and hopefully it will work out even better.</li>
    <li> Works well. Love MAC products. Good coverage</li>
    <li> The powder I received seemed old. I received it not too long a ago and already its coming loose in the compact.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M FROM BRAZIL AND IT&#x27;S REALLY EXPENSIVE BUY MAC MAKES HERE!!!&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY LOVE BUY IN THE AMAZON.COM AND THIS STORES AND I WILL BUY ANOTHER ONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS A LOT !!!</li>
    <li> MAC ALWAYS NAME THEIR PRODUCTS NOT JUST NC20 AND ALL MACS DOESN&#x27;T COME WITH A SPONGE APPLICATOR, IN FACT MAC PRODUCTS DOESN&#x27;T COME WITH APPLICATORS SUCH AS SPONGES, BRUSHES FOR EYESHADOWS. THIS IS A FAKE MAC.</li>
    <li> I am a heavy user of Mac and I like it. I use this brand for years already, and this is one that I like the most.</li>
    <li> Slight disclaimer, I have been using Bare Minerals for the past 3 years and was looking for a powder that would give better coverage (I am prone to pimples and have a lot of freckles).  One thing this powder is GREAT for is coverage...which is good, because after using this for a few days, my face broke out and has been a train wreck ever since. I just switched back to Bare Minerals and am already seeing an improvement.    Bottom line...don&#x27;t use it!</li>
    <li> Was amazing! Loved it</li>
    <li> I love MAC!  I can&#x27;t live without it!  It covers my skin making it look flawless without having to use any liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> Not real product. Not M.A.C. Makeup. I wish I would have read the reviews before I bought, but I saw that it was fulfilled by amazon and trusted it was good. IT IS NOT REAL M.A.C. Product. It is a cheap Imitation. Not worth $1.00. DO NOT BUY. If you have already bought and are reading this after you find out it is fake. Like I did:&lt;br /&gt;Call amazon customer service they will give you a refund and tell you how to report this seller. What they are doing is wrong. REPORT them.</li>
    <li> I think the lady gave me a color that is too dark for my skin but maybe i had a tan at the time; okay my skin is VERY oily and i feel that at first the powder does make your skin look flawless BUT within an hour it is running down my face and leaving creases, smearing, and just looks a wreak! Does not stay in place and rubs off if i touch my face-very frustrating!  I do not recommend it for oily skin at all!</li>
    <li> This is clearly fake! Bad quality and there is not supposed to be an applicator and it should not have a section to lift up to hold the applicator. If you have seen real mac, you can tell just from the picture it is fake.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get the FAKE reviews on here..  it is absolutely wrong.. this is the correct product, I just received a shipment from the official MAC cosmetics website.. and what is pictured above, is exactly as it is sold from MAC. There is another compartment on the bottom holding a sponge as well as a mirror in the inside top lid.&lt;br /&gt;For those posting this is a fake product advertised in this picture, I urge you to visit a MAC counter and look at the product in person.</li>
    <li> I just love mac foundation and how it looks on my skin I just had to order it</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t drop it! The only reason I&#x27;ve ever had to buy new compacts is that they&#x27;re unable to survive tumbles out of the purse. Really annoying.</li>
    <li> Yeah this is quite bizarre indeed.  I&#x27;m actually on the M.A.C. and Amazon sites simultaneously, and the Studio Fix and Studio Tech BOTH have the dual compartments....and they have for years and from 2004 from what I personally remember. Not sure whats going on here, and I can&#x27;t speak for what some may have specifically received, but to state they are fake because of the packaging just isn&#x27;t accurate!      Here, now everyone can look for themselves :)     [...]</li>
    <li> This came in a Mac compact case but something was a little off. As a Mac consumer, I can tell you, this was not MAC Studio Fix. The price was too good to be true.. annnnnnd it wasn&#x27;t true.</li>
    <li> For reference: I have very pale skin with red undertones. I use topicals for acne and rosacea. Rosacea means that at any time, for any reason, my skin can and will suddenly flush red and blotchy; it can stay that way or it may calm down. My skin is combination; it starts out dry but becomes greasy in a hurry throughout the day. It&#x27;s also &#x27;mature skin&#x27; now, I guess. Just some crinklage starting in the eye area, I try to take good care of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been experimenting around with foundations again, seeing what else is out there. I love Smashbox Camera Ready, but that cream formulation is not really serving me well right now, with summer here. My face is like waterfowl near the Exxon Valdez about an hour after I use it, and even the BB Cream isn&#x27;t containing it. After a year I finally broke down and gave in to the MAC hype, I ordered a box of foundations directly from MAC to see which one matches me. You may need to experiment heavily to find just the right tone, and if one doesn&#x27;t work, try the opposite tone no matter what anyone tells you you &#x27;should&#x27; wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This formula, in NW15, was a perfect match. But it&#x27;s a powder, and Retin-A means that my face is perpetually peely and flaking. Powder formulas normally make beacons out of the dry skin areas. I put this foundation on last night, straight, with no primer at all. I used the Sephora Mineral brush (my absolute favorite for powder foundations)SEPHORA COLLECTION Classic Mineral Powder Brush #45 and it went on like a dream. I started on the nose, and worked my way outward, and it looked great. So great, that it totally covered up every single discoloration, and I looked stark white. But, I *am* stark white, I&#x27;m just not used to seeing my skin look completely blank like that. It almost looked geisha-like (but in a good way). With such a perfect canvas, it was easy to make blush look like it should, and not like I&#x27;m having a fever or embarassed. What&#x27;s more, I guess I&#x27;d become accustomed to the shine that inevitably accompanies a cream foundation; the BB Cream itself imparts a lustrous finish. This stuff was flat out MATTE. (Others suggest using the Fix+ for that, I now use Urban Decay De-slick which acts as a mattifyer AND makes it dewy) The makeup washed off easily when it was time to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...on to today! I primed with the Smashbox BB Cream in Fair. Then using the Real Techniques Buffer (wanted to try it, and it&#x27;s fabulous, not as dense as the Sephora)real Techniques Core Collection Set I applied the MAC foundation again. Once again it was flawless, but with the BB Cream as a primer it was not dull and matte, it had a little shine to it. But by essentially whiting out my face (hey it matches my neck!) all the other makeup really popped because it wasn&#x27;t competing with the pink undertones. I put on some MAC Half Red lipliner and some lighter gloss on top to kind of lighten it up a little, and it really looked great. I was super impressed! But, it felt like a mask. In the heat throughout the day, I could REALLY feel this on my face, and it felt like my face was suffocating. As I was driving I noticed that my nose looked shiny, so I took a good look and all my face was *!!SHINY!!**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read some reviews from others that Philosophy The Present was the perfect primer to use with this instead of what I&#x27;ve been using, so I went to the store to get it. The sales clerk asked me some questions while I was swatching on some of The Present; she thought I had never used primer before and I told her I normally use the Smashbox BB Cream. She kind of reared her head back a little as she looked at me with my super shiny robot face and her mouth made a funny shape as she asked, \\&quot;You use it now??\\&quot; Yeah lady I know how I look right now. I told her I was wearing the MAC and she curled her lip as she said, \\&quot;I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s not worth the hype\\&quot;. Thanks, lady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got home I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash this thick paste off my face! By then my face felt like it had mud on it. It essentially looked great, just shiny like I was on a sweaty coke binge. I noticed as I washed my face, that my skin along the jawline was peeling off in pieces. Not flakes, but actual pieces like little sheets. WOW this stuff must be drying as all heck. Even with BB Cream. As the hours have gone by since I removed the makeup, I&#x27;ve noticed more and more zits popping up on my face. Just about 20 minutes ago a big red welt came up on the end of my nose, and it looks like I have a 3rd nostril trying to form. I can feel them on my chin as well. NOT HAPPY that I&#x27;m wishing I had a paper bag like the Unknown Comic!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Using Philosophy&#x27;s The Present Philosophy The Present Clear Makeup, 2 Ounce under this powder, with the Urban Decay De-Slick Urban Decay De-Slick Oil-Control Makeup Setting Spray 4 oz..(The Present, apply foundation, light misting of De-Slick) made the appearance of the makeup much much better. It wasn&#x27;t anywhere near the grease/shine level as previous wearing. However, it still felt heavy on my face (Unlike the Smashbox Camera Ready) and I still couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it off. And, sadly, it still broke me out. But on a good note, I&#x27;m loving the Philosophy product under foundations that are more drying than the Smashbox, it&#x27;s a whole other animal from the Smashbox BB Cream. Normally I don&#x27;t like Philosophy skin care products, but have to admit this one is a real winner! It also has a soothing property to it that the BB Cream doesn&#x27;t impart. NO SPF though, that&#x27;s a bummer. I have since found that MAC products work great with the Philosophy primer but I cannot get any of them to cooperate with the Smashbox BB Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE II: This foundation caused such a severe flare up that I looked like I&#x27;d just won a cherry pie eating contest, with my hands tied behind my back. Chin and cheeks engorged with red inflamed bumps and pustules, knots and pimples on my forehead, end of my nose, and cheeks. Some under my jawline as well. To make matters worse, I could&#x27;t use my Lancome Huile Doceur to wash, without it stinging and inflaming my face further. My backup cleansers (Cetaphil, Cerave, DHC Deep Cleansing Oil) similarly irritated my face. The only thing that calmed it down and enabled the healing to begin was straight coconut oil. A week later my face is just down to the healed but flaky stage and I still cannot use any of my normal cleansers without inflammation and irritation. Maybe that is a good thing, since the coconut oil costs a fraction of the cleansers! But I do find it disturbing that a foundation product can incite such an allergic reaction that it changes the way your skin acts EVEN WHEN YOU STOP USING IT. Thanks to this MAC product I had to completely change my entire skincare routine and eliminate all cleansers except for just plain coconut oil. That profoundly stuns me, that ONE PRODUCT can change your skin like that. Just...wow. On the plus side, my face loves the coconut oil.y face felt like it had mud on it.

    <li> This is not an authorized MAC seller. MAC does not sell our products on Amazon, nor do we allow others to sell our products. This is considered a counterfeit. We do track where these products come from and if we find out that you used a \\&quot;pro card\\&quot; to purchase this product at a discount from our store, you card will be revoked permanently. Ladies, you can purchase the REAL product from our website or our stores or counters. Do not trust makeup with our name on it from anyone other than us.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t actually buy the product but was tempted. Like someone said, there&#x27;s a really good youtube video on how to tell the difference between real and fake MAC. I could tell in the pics that the name of the foundation nc/nw etc was on a sticker and MAC usually prints that on the container(the box). So once I saw the sticker in the pictures I had a feeling it was fake and after reading the reviews, it looks like this might be a fake. So I&#x27;d be careful!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my sister and she told me it is a FAKE one. She said that she bought one before and it stayed very long with good quality. I tried by myself and hey, I can feel the differences. My sister and me don&#x27;t have oily skin, we have almost white skin with no tan at all. So, I don&#x27;t think the problems come from us.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I rated this one 3 stars before because it wasn&#x27;t sealed like they said, but I didn&#x27;t put it on. Now, when I figure it out, I&#x27;ll never buy it again and of course, no recommendation for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, but I&#x27;m very frustrated after I know the truth.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product a few weeks ago. This Mac Studio Fix Powder Plus Foundation was a few dollars cheaper than the one on MacCosmetics.com  I absolutely adored this product for the first few weeks until it began to get overwhelmly hot and humid. I have very oily skin and mac products are really heavy on the face. They cake up really fast and easily.    By 3 or 4 o&#x27;clock my face look blotchy and shiny. I do not recommened this product for people with acne or oily prone skin.  But if you have a dry skin, this may be the product for you.    XOXO</li>
    <li> All women, young and old, have tried many make up products in their lives, whether it was an inexpensive brand or a high- priced brand. They have most likely tried products that irritated their skin, felt too heavy and spent money on products that didn&#x27;t give them any coverage at all. MAC studio fix powder is the solution to all those problems. It is a product that women of any age and any color can use; this product is a good price for the economic problems, ladies might have and covers all the imperfections that women are afraid to show. I can relate to this product because I use it on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;MAC studio fix powder is a powder and a foundation combined in one and is very easy to apply, rather than going through the hassle of applying liquid foundation and then later applying a matte powder, the studio fix powder is a one-step application. This is good for women of any age, whether you&#x27;re eighteen or fifty this would be a great to use. For teenagers the powder does an amazing job covering any acne that may occur, as well as dark circles and uneven skin tones. For women, age fifty and up, all the wrinkles and dark spots are erased within a blink of an eye. MAC studio fix powder is made in thirty- two different shades so any one is able to use it.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve been spending too much money on products that don&#x27;t work, you&#x27;ll love how the studio fix powder is within a reasonable budget and how much coverage you can get from applying it once a day. This product feels very light on the skin and looks very natural too. Many powders can make your face look cakey and oily, the studio fix powder is very different; it makes your skin look flawless just like a celebrity&#x27;s make up would. Many celebrities use MAC&#x27;s merchandise because they love how it feels on their skin and after a long day it still looks nice. We all know who Kim Kardashian is, she is one of the many celebrities that uses this product on a daily basis and she uses it for a lot of her photo shoots. Not only is this great for everyday use, it looks beautiful when wearing it to parties.&lt;br /&gt;  Some may argue that this powder makes your face oily and it feels heavy on the skin, but many women love this product and they use it all the time. Some also say that it can&#x27;t be applied every day, only on special occasions, but depending on how much you apply is the result you&#x27;ll get. From what reviews say online, this product is very good at covering all imperfections and it doesn&#x27;t feel as heavy as other products may feel on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;  After searching for a long time for a good product, many women say that the MAC studio fix powder, is by far the best \\&quot;two- in- one\\&quot; product out there. Almost every women can relate to make up because they all use it, so why not use something that you will love from the start. This powder is very good at giving a women full coverage and doesn&#x27;t clog any of your pores like other powders may do. Lastly when you purchase this, you&#x27;ll feel great knowing that you can have a portable powder and foundation in your purse at all times.</li>
    <li> I received the compact and took it out of the box and into my makeup bag to use when I finished the rest of my other Mac that I bought from the Mac store. A couple weeks later I opened my new Mac and it had an odd smell to it. I did a little comparison between the two and I believe the one I bought was a counterfeit Mac:-/</li>
    <li> Ladies,&lt;br /&gt;The best powder one can buy. I stuck with Bare Essentials for years and finally sat at a Mac counter to get the MAC Dazzle mascara and tried the Studio Fix powder and instantly fell in love. I have a sensitive face so was a little hesitant to try but it was a nice and even foundation that didn&#x27;t break me out. Not chalky or dry at all. At the end of the day of course my face is a little oily but I can re apply before I go out and my skin looks flawless(which it never does)!</li>
    <li> Hola, este polvo es muy bueno, se ve el cutis muy bonito, valió la pena la compra, la entrega fue rápida y llego en buenas condiciones.&lt;br /&gt;Nota Importante: El producto SÍ es original.&lt;br /&gt;Muchas gracias y saludos desde Venezuela :)</li>
    <li> Better than drugstore products and got a good deal on Amazon but still searching for a better match for my large pores and shine by the end of the work day.  Not overjoyed but not hugely disappointed either.</li>
    <li> Still a good product in comparison to buying directly for mt he MAC store, I&#x27;ve been lucky in that respect since I&#x27;ve been trying to save some money in buying them from a 3rd party online. The only difference I see is in the dryness or how the outside layer of the compact becomes a texture that is difficult to work with. The dryness could be from the oxidization that comes over a period of time. Maybe this is why the compacts are less expensive, maybe they have passed their prime??? I don&#x27;t know, but so far so good- if you can be diligent about the way you use the sponge or brushes when applying and try not to introduce waters or oils that can counteract the awesomeness it should be ok but I should mention I go through my compacts about every 6-8 wks so if you don&#x27;t use them that quickly you may want to op for an in store purchase.</li>
    <li> fake! Feels worse than the cheapest store brand.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, and it is wonderful!  It is perfect for my complexion and never causes break-outs!</li>
    <li> This is not real MAC product. It is cheap crap. I do not recommend you purchase this product. May as well buy a cheap one at the grocery store for $3.</li>
    <li> Good...although the box didn&#x27;t seem to be brand new. No plastic covering over powder either. But still good quality. Got here faster than expected.</li>
    <li> Oh my...... I won&#x27;t says..</li>
    <li> Excellent product ! Great Seller!</li>
    <li> Excelent product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cumplio con lo esperado en calidad y tiempo en la entrega.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;contento con el servicio entregado por el proveedor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;muchas gracias</li>
    <li> I have used MAC Studio Fix for years and this product is FAKE! I didn&#x27;t want to believe that I could be sold an item that wasn&#x27;t what it stated to be in the product description, but I was.  I contacted and brought the product to MAC and it was confirmed fake!  It smelled different (true MAC product is odorless), the sponge sent with it was wrong (it was large and I can&#x27;t even close the compact), and the product that was trying to be passed as MAC was substandard in every way.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER... YOU DON&#x27;T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO GET!</li>
    <li> Powder is a different consistency than when I buy at a store.  Maybe it was due to the shipping, but the powder started chipping out of the compact right away and is so much of a mess that I have to store it upright in a plastic bag.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time, just go to a store.</li>
