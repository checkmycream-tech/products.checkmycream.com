      <li>As a satisfied customer this set does the job one hopes it would do-</li>

      <li>it works better on rubber</li>

      <li>This product got my shoes clean, just not as clean as I would have liked.</li>
      <li>I like having the suede bar as well as the brush to do the best job spiffing up suede shoes and other items.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone that has Ugg boots or any other suede boot that needs cleaning.</li>
      <li>and it does a great job of keeping suede looking new &amp; clean.</li>
      <li>The cleaning bar breaks easily while using it</li>
      <li>The 3&#x27; brush does not do the job as easily as if it were longer.</li>
      <li>I will not go into what this did not do for stains across the toes of a pair of boots - but it did not even clean the dust out of the top of the boots (no staining or visible dirt there,</li>
      <li>, atho a good soft brass brush may be better-</li>
      <li>the brush is mostly used to clean my Kangol Hats or clean my fingernails</li>
      <li>My friend proceeded to spill his drink on my shoes which created a huge spot on the shoes.</li>
      <li>This works great for daily brushing up.</li>
      <li>The wood handle has a light finish.  </li>
      <li>The eraser works well, you just have to use a light hand or it crumbles.  </li>
      <li>I have a pair of light colored suede Clark desert books that I wore out without having sprayed on any water/stain resistant coating.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Works amazing, highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a cobbler, I don&#x27;t know how to clean shoes.</li>
      <li>I would recommend for light wear but these just dont cut it for anything more intense.</li>
      <li>So i need a cleaning bar to clean up after the cleaning bar?</li>
      <li>This product restored my \\&quot;suede\\&quot; Adidas Porsche shoes to like new condition, very easy to use and clean.</li>
      <li>I did read about complaints that the suede bar creates a lot of dust, which was true.</li>
      <li>Well, actually brown, but The King is always a good lead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My shoes looks so much better for much longer.</li>
      <li>Not bad for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>BEST hands down for cleaning all your leather I use it on my Desert combat boots and it gets them looking brand new!</li>
      <li>Otherwise, they would be great for any other suede.</li>
      <li>item shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>This brush could come quickly, which is why I ordered it.  </li>
      <li>Now my favorite pair of suede shoes will continue looking new.</li>
      <li>Makes a lot of lint/dust/eraser stuff, so make sure you&#x27;re doing this outside, on newspaper, or have a vacuum handy!  </li>
      <li>It works great, if you use it to clean small stains.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun, but it can be discouraging when I can&#x27;t get rid of the stains after I</li>
      <li>VIGOROUSLY(probably shouldn&#x27;t have lol) and a small portion of the bar is gone(clearly).</li>
      <li>I purchased this product mainly for the suede brush, as I own a few suede jackets that I want to keep in top condition.</li>
      <li>I bought the woodlore 3\\&quot; suede bar and brush to clean my new Ugg</li>
      <li>but if I actually had suede shoes it might have more value that the bar thingy.</li>
      <li>and it works really really well!</li>
      <li>They are only ok at some of these types of marks.</li>
      <li>doesnt really clean anything like magic,,, does remove some unwanted color slightly, its ok for the extremely low price that u pay.</li>
      <li>It has soft nylon bristles that clean my shoes without damaging them.  </li>
      <li>Quality wise the brush seems it will last a while but only time will tell.</li>
      <li>appearance.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- very intuitive to use not complicated</li>
      <li>used the eraser like cleaning bar and the brush it brought back almost the original color and gave it the whole new clean</li>
      <li>I know it wasn&#x27;t a smart move, but I had nothing else to go in.</li>
      <li>I think that&#x27;s a fine rate of cleaning, especially since my boots had not been cleaned in years.  </li>
      <li>You shouldn&#x27;t be anyway, because the proper way to use it is to lightly brush your leather nap.  </li>
      <li>light brown suede, and white and tan nubuck shoes.</li>
      <li>The brush really needs to be stiffer to make any difference.</li>
      <li>Worked very well, would buy again when I am through with this bar.</li>
      <li>The eraser works reasonably well..</li>
      <li>but I knew not to expect too much.</li>
      <li>Got 2 stars because there were a couple stains/marks that came up ok with a minimal level of residue.</li>
      <li>shipped fast too</li>
      <li>I guess alcohol didn&#x27;t come out very well.</li>
      <li>The brush is absolutely prefect.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t see much of a difference on suede products..</li>
      <li>The wood used is light, and similar to the balsa wood I made race cars out of when I was a Cub Scout.  </li>
      <li>Use it gently, though.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I use a regular eraser to rub out the marks on my aforementioned boots.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works as expected, no complaints other than the bristles being smashed to the side a bit.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  This is slowly taking out a very large stain on my suede mocs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using tools similar to these, for years.  They will help clean your suede, and make it last longer!</li>
    <li> My favorite game is Yahtzee, but not far behind is one I invented myself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coffee? Blood? Or Salsa?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I play it every time I have a brownish stain on any of my attire, which is to say I play it a couple times a week. (Lifetime record, 231-4-2) It&#x27;s fun, but it can be discouraging when I can&#x27;t get rid of the stains after I play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to worry about that on my Bucks anymore, though, because they are SPOTLESS after just five minutes of work with this bar and brush. They&#x27;re about 2 years old but looking like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase, both quality and value.</li>
    <li> Works as described, the cleaner bar takes some finnese to get working correctly but it does the job.  Used on Adidas suede uppers and lowers, they look like new now.</li>
    <li> My title says it all. Just what I was looking for...Now my favorite pair of suede shoes will continue looking new.</li>
    <li> Used on my nubuck shoes and my roughout redwings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaned them up very nicely!  Makes a lot of lint/dust/eraser stuff, so make sure you&#x27;re doing this outside, on newspaper, or have a vacuum handy!  Got through three pairs of shoes and went through maybe 10% of the bar.  I think that&#x27;s a fine rate of cleaning, especially since my boots had not been cleaned in years.  Worked very well, would buy again when I am through with this bar.</li>
    <li> My suede shoes were starting to turn black, it&#x27;s a light colored shoes and due to usage they were getting all dirty that a regular brush just couldn&#x27;t clean.&lt;br /&gt;I used the eraser like cleaning bar and the brush it brought back almost the original color and gave it the whole new clean appearance.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- very intuitive to use not complicated&lt;br /&gt;- cleans well and does not damage material&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- not very easy to use especially if the shoes fabric is very soft making it hard to press on it&lt;br /&gt;- The cleaning bar breaks easily while using it</li>
    <li> Tried this  product on my red suede handbag.  Not only didn&#x27;t it erase the dirt built up on the sides, it faded the color so much that I couldn&#x27;t use it on the front side of the bag.  Guess I&#x27;ll have to spend the $50.00 and have it  professionally cleaned!</li>
    <li> I have a green suede jacket that had stains around the sleeve openings.  The Woodlore 3\\&quot;  Suede Bar and 3\\&quot; Brush worked wonders.  Fantastic product!!!</li>
    <li> The brush does a fine job of keeping the nap on my UGH boots looking nice.  The eraser works well, you just have to use a light hand or it crumbles.  Not sure it would work so well on a darker colored suede boot or shoe.</li>
    <li> I ordered one of these a month or so ago.  I was so pleased with it that I ordered 2 more so I could have 1 for work and a second one at home for my daughter.  Good price on a no-nonsense product.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my suede chukkas. The suede material was a little more delicate than most, so the bar and brush were a little rough on it. Otherwise, they would be great for any other suede.</li>
    <li> I have some suede shoes that needed to be cleaned.  This brush could come quickly, which is why I ordered it.  It&#x27;s worked!</li>
    <li> Quite pleased with this purchase. The eraser works on my Sperry nubuck boat shoes and the brush I actually have used on my suede shoes as well.</li>
    <li> I bought the woodlore 3\\&quot; suede bar and brush to clean my new Ugg boots.&lt;br /&gt;I am really glad I bought the cleaner in the store, but then I needed a brush (according to the directions).&lt;br /&gt;This item shipped quickly. I am very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone that has Ugg boots or any other suede boot that needs cleaning.</li>
    <li> This product is a must have for any owner of suede. I didn&#x27;t know how handy it would come in until I owned it. My shoes looks so much better for much longer. Order now!!!</li>
    <li> Its the typical suede brush and eraser, vital in suede upkeep</li>
    <li> I will not go into what this did not do for stains across the toes of a pair of boots - but it did not even clean the dust out of the top of the boots (no staining or visible dirt there, just dusty)&lt;br /&gt;Could not recommend this product at all!</li>
    <li> As someone who has gone through her fair share of suede shoes, I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase.  Although some dark smudges were not perfectly gone, the eraser and brush significantly helped.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t perfect but it cleaned up my suede shoes. The bar does deteriorate a bit when using but this is expected. It does so at a very slow rate. I don&#x27;t see myself running out of it at any point.</li>
    <li> The eraser works reasonably well..it works better on rubber as opposed to suede..didn&#x27;t see much of a difference on suede products..</li>
    <li> This product restored my \\&quot;suede\\&quot; Adidas Porsche shoes to like new condition, very easy to use and clean. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> you know, i would review these things more often if you&#x27;d just let me just click on the star rating and be done with it. yeah… it&#x27;s good and all.</li>
    <li> This is a stiff rubber bar that is not unlike a large eraser.  It will crumble as you use it.. It is soft but stiff.  It can crack easily if you are too firm with it.. You shouldn&#x27;t be anyway, because the proper way to use it is to lightly brush your leather nap.  The dirty oil and dirt is picked up and rolled into the rubber particles.  Be prepared for a big mess though..  Have a hand-vacuum cleaner handy, otherwise this will get all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar is white and will actually work to lighten the leather.  I&#x27;m not sure if white pigment is making the leather lighter, or if it&#x27;s cleaning it.. Nevertheless it spared my creamy suede leather jacket from the trashcan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works amazing, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Results are amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;Its kind of messy because you literally erase the stains and dirt from the suede just like a normal eraser so little bits and pieces come off, but the end result is way worth the mess. The brush works perfectly.</li>
    <li> The brush is pretty ineffective-  too soft.  The &amp;#34;eraser&amp;#34; is adequate but makes one heck of a mess-  each swipe with it makes a lot of eraser shavings.</li>
    <li> This works really good to clean my Sperry topsiders. It didn&#x27;t get out the grease stain I bought it for though. I tried cornstarch to get out the grease stain and then tried the suede bar and brush again and they almost look like new. You can barely see the stain now. I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> The suede bar is excellentl but the brush needs to be stiffer. Used bar in conjunction wit a brush had some metal bristles and shoes came out great.</li>
    <li> It met my expectations. It is not perfect to erase all the spots off suede but did a fairly good job</li>
    <li> As a satisfied customer this set does the job one hopes it would do- brushes off dirt, fluffs the nap, and cleans off stains.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> It works as it is intended to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No surprises, and the bar is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought it just for the suede bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GDB</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this did not get the stains out of my suede boots. It did slightly minimize the appearance of them. I guess alcohol didn&#x27;t come out very well.</li>
    <li> The shoe brush is small, but I kind of expected that.  What I didn&#x27;t expect was something of such poor quality.  The wood used is light, and similar to the balsa wood I made race cars out of when I was a Cub Scout.  The wood handle has a light finish.  However, it does not protect against the splinters that occur during usage.  The bristles are too stiff to use on anything less rugged than my Timberland boots.  It would destroy anything that is more delicate (forget about using it on your new, expensive suede shoes).  I found a better brush at a Walgreen&#x27;s store.  I think it&#x27;s used for hands, or fingernails.  It has soft nylon bristles that clean my shoes without damaging them.  One of the item&#x27;s selling points is that it comes with a suede bar.  I imagine this is used to rub out the dirt before brushing.  Honestly, I use a regular eraser to rub out the marks on my aforementioned boots.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  I couldn&#x27;t even give it away at a garage sale.</li>
    <li> The eraser works pretty well, but the brush is not stiff enough in my opinion.  It does not clean much off after spraying the shoe with cleaner or using the eraser.</li>
    <li> the brand of the one i received is actually &amp;#34;allen edmonds&amp;#34;. whatever it is, its great. i use the suede bar and brush on lighter colored suede to remove marks, and on black suede i only use the brush. it makes my shoes look brand new.</li>
    <li> I went clubbing in suede shoes. I know it wasn&#x27;t a smart move, but I had nothing else to go in. Needless to say I came out with spilt drinks and scuff marks all over. The bar and brush got almost all of it out and the shoes look pretty much new.</li>
    <li> I may have expected too much. It&#x27; does crumble, it actually reminds me of a giant eraser. I did not see where it cleaned my item that well.</li>
    <li> Works well. Stores well.</li>
    <li> The bar and brush are indeed great for suede, but do not use the brush on nubuck. The reason I bring this up is because the box says it is for suede and nubuck. You can use the bar on nubuck, but the nylon (I think they are nylon) brushes will scar nubuck. You need a brush with ruber bristles for nubuck.</li>
    <li> Initially bought this suede brush and bar for some of my sneakers and it works wonders in restoring its material and color back to its original form, or at least really close to it. Quality wise the brush seems it will last a while but only time will tell. I used the suede bar on about 3 sneakers VIGOROUSLY(probably shouldn&#x27;t have lol) and a small portion of the bar is gone(clearly). Caution: some colors may transfer from the item you&#x27;re cleaning onto bar. Depending on how you use the bar and how often will determine how long it&#x27;ll last. I predict mine to last around 3-5 weeks as I like to thoroughly clean my sneakers often. Have not tested on any other suede like items other than sneakers however, it seems it&#x27;ll work fine on suede jackets, boots, couches, shirts/sweaters etc.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eraser removes dirt from my suede boots. It didn&#x27;t remove blue dye from my jeans hems rubbing the boot tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is mainly to restore the nap.</li>
    <li> Cleans most stains on suede. But I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s much better than using a nail brush and a white eraser.</li>
    <li> Nice product, and I like having the suede bar as well as the brush to do the best job spiffing up suede shoes and other items. Use it gently, though.</li>
    <li> It worked, just not as well as I would have liked it to. It would have been more helpful if it came with directions on how to use. I&#x27;m not a cobbler, I don&#x27;t know how to clean shoes. Thank god for youtube. This product got my shoes clean, just not as clean as I would have liked. I used it on suede taupe Dolce Vita booties.</li>
    <li> This works great for daily brushing up. Haven&#x27;t used the cleaning much, but the brush gets my suede shoes looking great very quickly!</li>
    <li> does what it was described to do makes my timbs look great very pleased with this product. shipped fast too</li>
    <li> Worked exactly as described and saved a pair of my beloved shoes!  It is very messy as one other reviewer noted - I would go outside and do it if you have that option.</li>
    <li> doesnt really clean anything like magic,,, does remove some unwanted color slightly, its ok for the extremely low price that u pay.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it with leather soap but it doesn&#x27;t work by itself.</li>
    <li> The suede bar ia a miracle.  It removed dark areas in my  white  suede .  light brown suede, and white and tan nubuck shoes. I had previously purchased other brushes, all types,  but they never completely removed those dark areas.  This suede bar did.  I recommend this brush and bar if you have shoes, yo can&#x27;t lose.</li>
    <li> Does it work? Just look at the picture. It woked well enough for me to want to write this review.</li>
    <li> Well, actually brown, but The King is always a good lead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is inexpensive, and will work well on some minor stains or just light dirt on suede.  Good for maintenance, atho a good soft brass brush may be better- but those are hard to find now-a-days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a small stain a suede clothing and are considering expensive dry-cleaning, try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well on suede shoes, too.</li>
    <li> Great product. The brush works well and so does the eraser. Wish it was a little bigger but for the price it&#x27;s not bad. I used the brush and eraser on a pair of dark grey suede boots. I was nervous since some reviews mentioned discoloration, but had no problems or color changes on my boots.</li>
    <li> This product is just okay.  It does lighten the shade a bit, but that was no problem.  It does not remove greasy spills nor does it erase the line made when wet snow dries on the boot.  Other stains it does work on but all in all was disappointing but I knew not to expect too much.</li>
    <li> Did not work as well as id hoped it would. The few marks it got off my suede jacket, it left behind a white residue that wont come off. So i need a cleaning bar to clean up after the cleaning bar? Got 2 stars because there were a couple stains/marks that came up ok with a minimal level of residue. Ill be sucking it up and bringing it in for a pro cleaning.</li>
    <li> Arrived timely but made no difference in the marks on my tan suede boots.</li>
    <li> Decent product. Not great but decent</li>
    <li> These will do the job on small scuffs and everyday wear and tear marks. Just dont expect them to much more. After trying to remove a few light marks from grease or mud, i found these to be ineffective. They are only ok at some of these types of marks. I would recommend for light wear but these just dont cut it for anything more intense.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product mainly for the suede brush, as I own a few suede jackets that I want to keep in top condition. The brush is absolutely prefect. I to stiff but not so stiff that it will damage your valuable suede items, and it does a great job of keeping suede looking new &amp; clean. I will buy this item again - Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I use the brush to keep my boots cleaned. It works great, if you use it to clean small stains.  If it is a dark thick stains or mud this will not do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small and compact to carry in a bag.</li>
    <li> The brush really needs to be stiffer to make any difference. Also, the eraser part of the kit is too soft and does not make any difference at all on my suede items. I would not recommend the purchase.</li>
    <li> It got the rain stains off my uggs! Worked well but it didn&#x27;t get out some food stains I had on them. Love the product</li>
    <li> Iwas disappointed in the size of them both.  The 3&#x27; brush does not do the job as easily as if it were longer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Allen Edmonds brand.  Works great on my suede shoes.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> That little eraser thingy has kept my Addidas shell toe shoes looking fresh way past their expiration date. I use it ever few days to erase the smudges. and it works really really well! it make a lot of little flakes to I use it at my desk at work over a trash can to keep the mess down but outside, who cares right ;). the brush is mostly used to clean my Kangol Hats or clean my fingernails but if I actually had suede shoes it might have more value that the bar thingy. but yeah, all items have a purpose/use and I will continue to buy another one of these ever 6 months or so. I love you Woodlore sued bar and brushy thingy. you&#x27;re the best.</li>
    <li> It takes a little elbow grease, but this really works!  It took stains out of my husband&#x27;s new timberland boots.</li>
    <li> BEST hands down for cleaning all your leather I use it on my Desert combat boots and it gets them looking brand new! and passing inspection!</li>
    <li> This works on my swede shoes and de-pills my fleece.</li>
    <li> I have a pair of light colored suede Clark desert books that I wore out without having sprayed on any water/stain resistant coating. My friend proceeded to spill his drink on my shoes which created a huge spot on the shoes. I tried out this product and the difference from before is night and day. The shoe almost looks brand new. You can only really tell a difference in natural light. Great product, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to remedy situations such as mine. I did read about complaints that the suede bar creates a lot of dust, which was true. I would use this outside if possible. It did not bother me though. I would definitely buy this again if need be.</li>
