      <li>pillow pack is wonderful because when my daughter&#x27;s doll is missing her pillow, she can use my pillow pack.&lt;br /&gt;The 70-count is wonderful because when one snaps from being wrapped around a too-thick handful of hair, I have another one at the ready.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them catching on my hair.</li>
      <li>nice quality.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved these hairties, and buying these as an add-on saved me SO much money for SO many great hairties!</li>
      <li>even if I do, $5 for year(s) worth of headbands is a brilliant investment.</li>
      <li>Awesome price for such good quality hair ties</li>
      <li>Very strong.</li>
      <li>Very strong bands-</li>
      <li>This is a very good hair care brand, all of their products that I have tried have worked out very well.</li>
      <li>They break so easily!</li>
      <li>I feel like these things do more harm than good and if you have fine strands like me(natural or relaxed)</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is the perfect size - and the fact that the elastic is sort of squishy and soft makes them even better.  </li>
      <li>Great product for a much cheaper price than in store!</li>

      <li>Love &#x27;em.</li>
      <li>brand sure lives up to its name - to quote my baby girl, &amp;#34;goody, goody gumdrops!&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Perfect for keeping hair held back.</li>
      <li>Love these because they don&#x27;t snag my hair.</li>
      <li>plus we lose so many..</li>

      <li>Love this brand.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Um, this is such a great offer. 70 bands for about 5 bucks. You cant go into any drugstore and try that...&lt;br /&gt;Goody&#x27;s Goody. Good quality, you know what you&#x27;re paying for. It&#x27;s the price that got me, and I&#x27;ll continue to buy these in stock for this price for as long as I can</li>
    <li> I always have to makesure my roommate isn&#x27;t standing around when I&#x27;m putting my hair up with these. Half of these are okay, but LITERALLY, the other half will just snap and fling off somewhere. But they&#x27;re cheap. I get what I pay for.</li>
    <li> These break literally on the first time you wear them.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through almost the whole pack in week. Horrible buy. Never again</li>
    <li> Simple elastic hair bands for pony tails.  Our daughters use these daily and they get tons of use.  We purchased a larger quantity because no matter how many you have - you never have enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the perfect size - and the fact that the elastic is sort of squishy and soft makes them even better.  Great product!</li>
    <li> They do the job very well.  Product as described.</li>
    <li> half of the elastics busted while i was putting them on.</li>
    <li> I have had this pack for about a month now and have probably broke 20 of them. Product works great when it&#x27;s not snapping in half.</li>
    <li> They stretch out fast but so does every other one I&#x27;ve ever gotten. I have very curly hair and like my hair gathered tightly so I go through these like peppermint candies.</li>
    <li> Had trouble finding the thick bands at local stores.  This is my favorite brand because it is a strong elastic that stays in place and doesn&#x27;t break my hair when it is removed.  The ones with metal parts don&#x27;t last as long and shred my hair.</li>
    <li> They break after one use.</li>
    <li> I bought these because a lot of naturals raved about it and although I am now relaxed I thought they would be very gentle on my hair. Boy, was I wrong. These things are tighter than any metal bound elastic that I have ever seen, and when I double it I hear strands snapping, and I can actually feel it almost twisting my whole ponytail from the scalp! I never wear tight styles in general, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it should never feel like that when you do. I feel like these things do more harm than good and if you have fine strands like me(natural or relaxed) beware, because they will damage your hair. I don&#x27;t know why I ever doubted myself and jumped on this bandwagon when I never had much problems with my old hairties, only the occasional snap here and there, but not on EVERY install and take down!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best I love it ? I told my friends about it is amazing? My mom like it too?</li>
    <li> Fabulous! saved oodles of cash and perfect for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t pull on hair or tangle, I highly recommend this item</li>
    <li> This is exactly as you would expect, good quality, it won&#x27;t pull your hair or so I&#x27;ve been told by my wife 😁&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good price for a well made product. We will be buying more when she loses all one hundred of them.</li>
    <li> Nice thick hair ties what more can I say.</li>
    <li> My fiancee said that they were a little to tight when she was using them.</li>
    <li> Nice tight grip, no snagging, last well for a few uses - works well with my thick and heavy hair.</li>
    <li> Item was as advertised.</li>
    <li> Exactly what it says. Very stretchy and holds thick hair easily.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand of elastics for years and love them.  They are thick enough that I feel like my pony is tight and won&#x27;t fall out.  The only reason I gave it a four is because they do stretch out after awhile.  I won&#x27;t use another brand!</li>
    <li> Great price. Works as expected.</li>
    <li> these are way too big for what I bought them for but if you have lots of hair, they probably will be fine.</li>
    <li> I was expecting them to be smaller.  These are definitely the thicker kind to use for ponytails, not the thin ones for tying the ends of braids.</li>
    <li> Our favorite for pony tails</li>
    <li> You get what u pay for. They are what is describe in the details section. No glue spots visible. It&#x27;s a tight band holder.</li>
    <li> Your run of the mill normal thick, no metal rubber bands. Great for ponys, no so much for buns. They dont stretch that much. Great shipping.</li>
    <li> they do lose their tension a little quicker than I would like but for the price it is a good deal</li>
    <li> Held my wife&#x27;s hair in place.  I don&#x27;t know what else to say about hair bands.</li>
    <li> My girls go through these so quickly, so I couldn&#x27;t pass up the price on these. Great value for the amount of pieces per pack. The quality is excellent and can hold ponytails during volleyball and soccer tournaments.</li>
    <li> Perfect for keeping hair held back. Last a long time. Even if they get stretched out they will eventually go back to their old shape. I leave them in the shower so the process of moisture and drying help shrink them a bit. Love &#x27;em.</li>
    <li> Great value.  My kids need many of these since they seem to keep losing them.  So these is a great way to keep my cost low.</li>
    <li> Smells like rubber. The smell goes away after a couple of use, but still makes me feel like it&#x27;s cheap. Good for the buck, but not best quality.</li>
    <li> I love these hair bands. They don&#x27;t pull your hair out as much as others can. I use these to put my hair in a bun. The shipping was very fast too.</li>
    <li> Close your eyes and say &amp;#34;Goody Ouchless Pillow Pack Black Elastics&amp;#34;.  At what point did you actually know what the actual product was?  Could the name be any longer?  The bright side, however, is that they&#x27;re ouchless.  And they come in a pillow back.  And they are Goody.  Perhaps, then, the lead-in to &amp;#34;elastics&amp;#34; was worth it.</li>
    <li> You know how the magic hair tie thief always comes around and steals your hair ties one by one when you&#x27;re not looking, only to find that you have exactly one tie left that you are now forced to guard with your life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save these for later in your cart and order them when you&#x27;re down to a handful and thank me later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and no metal pieces to rip out your hair? Yes, please.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, curly hair. And usually hair elastics don&#x27;t last very long. They either stretch out too much or just pop. These are very sturdy and durable. The elastic holds my hair in place very well. Will definitely order this again when the time comes!</li>
    <li> I prefer goody ouchless hair bands over any others. We try to buy them in bulk because we have a tendency to misplace them all over the world...</li>
    <li> These are great. I have very long, thick hair and usually can only wrap my hair in a ponytail twice before the elastic breaks. Not with These!! These are very sturdy!!Have not broken ONE since I have bought them them.</li>
    <li> The good news is that 70 of these little guys is a lot! The bad news is that they are not the best quality. Most of the ones I&#x27;ve used so far are nice and tight before the first use, and I only use them for normal pony tails while working out and when I take them out of my hair, the elastic has already broken so the thread is the only thing keeping it together. But I&#x27;ll probably buy them again when I run out because the price is really good and again, 70 is a lot.</li>
    <li> They are hair bands and they do break and stretch out. I have had several break on me with minimal stretching and lots of them have stretched out past their useful size.  They work when they work... hairbands are meant to be replaced over time. These may need to be replaced a little more often but you do get a bunch at a good price so I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with losing all my elastic hairbands throughout the week. I needed something cheap and numerous to get my hair up in pony tails. This works great!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t stretch out easily or break easily. It doesn&#x27;t hurt when I put them on or pull them out.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick , Black asian hair and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Being someone who has very long hair, Ouchless Goody&#x27;s for me is a must. I hate the metal band in the middle of other elastics, somehow my hair always ends up tangled in it and I have to rip and break my hair in order to free it. These, however, are perfect. I&#x27;m glad I got the big pack -- I&#x27;m always losing them hair ties and the price is pretty great for so many. I will be a return customer.</li>
    <li> What happened to Goody?  These bands are so cheap and they pull and tangle and are so difficult to remove.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!  I found these and recommend highly: lace Kenzola 5-pc Ouchless Clear Fluorescence Colour Hair Elastic Ties Bands Supplies Accessories for Women Girls</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been searching all over for these sturdy, reliable ponytail holders.  Totally worth buying in a pack of 70.  Definitely ouchless, and 70 will last as long as 2 years.</li>
    <li> these ponytail holders came faster than expected for me, I did realize that most people said that these brake easily. so when they arrived I took a few out and pulled them to see how durable they are and I had to pull really hard to make them snap. they seem to be normal working ponytail holders to me! they work fine and I love the &amp;#34;ouchless&amp;#34; part, so there isn&#x27;t a metal piece in the middle of them. hope this helps!!</li>
    <li> Great product for a much cheaper price than in store!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay tight or slide off.  I think a ribbed elastic would be much better for a &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Came in a ziploc bag rather than a box as shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re okay. The ties are thick and the material is soft. They look like they&#x27;ll hold up.&lt;br /&gt;Will update if needed.</li>
    <li> These ponytails (aka elastics) are thick and tight. They&#x27;re pretty good at holding up a high ponytail without loosening throughout the day and letting it drop. The price is definitely pretty good for 70 of them, too. I&#x27;d recommend combining this pack with the &amp;#34;Diane 2&amp;#34; Bobby Pins 1lb Box&amp;#34; in order to never worry about running out of hair containment devices (though your significant other or parents might get a little miffed at the shear quantity of them that you can now lose around the house.)</li>
    <li> Not the real deal, I use Goody Ouchless scrunches daily for YEARS, they hold up to the test for woman of thick hair. However, these break and stretch out sometimes after the very first use and simply trying to use the first time and SNAP! No good!</li>
    <li> Great brand,  especially if you have a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered two packages of these which adds up to 140 ponytail elastics!  Since I always wear my hair up, I always need strong, comfortable elastics on hand.  I used to buy them at Target or Walgreen&#x27;s, but they didn&#x27;t carry this particular Goody product.  These are the best whether you have fine or thick hair.  If you want to learn more about them, read about it on Goody&#x27;s website.  You cannot purchase them there; that&#x27;s when you need Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> These are the only types of hair bands that work for me. They last and don&#x27;t pull our hair. I like how many I get because I lose these like they are attached to butterflies and just go up to the sky when I put them down.</li>
    <li> Lots of good quality hair ties for a decent price. My hair ties usually stretch out very quickly, but this hair tie has not stretched out yet with continuous 4 day wear so far.</li>
    <li> Very strong. Held up my daughters very thick hair.</li>
    <li> These are sturdy and handy for all kinds of jobs. They work great for hair. However, I use them most often like rubber bands to keep things together. They last much longer. Great price.</li>
    <li> Price is great, they seem strong. Bought these to hopefully last my girls til mid school year. They are the glued kind, not woven or banded with metal. they might be a bit large for someone with thin hair but they are def great for people with thick.</li>
    <li> These are so easy to break.  Each one of them break at the same connecting point after 2-3 uses.  Cheap but trash product.</li>
    <li> works good, I haven&#x27;t had no problems with it, no pulling of my hair or no breaking from stretching them out</li>
    <li> I always lose hair elastics so I was excited to find this on Amazon. I also like that they have it as a subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> Reliable heavy hair ties.  I have really thick and really long hair.  These bands stick with me.  They rarely break even under heavy use.  A definite for the big hair people</li>
    <li> I really like Goody hair products; normally they are very reliable. I had some ouchless bands before and thought these were the same type. They break so easily! The bands are not a solid loop. That is to say, it has a seam; which is the weak point. I don&#x27;t know if they are glued or heat sealed at this point, but it snaps and gives way too darn easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are cloth-like and won&#x27;t snag your hair like rubber can pull at least. If you buy them, I hope you have better luck with the product than I did. Happy Amazoning.</li>
    <li> I like the amount I got for the price so it was definitely value for money. I wanted all black specifically so that worked for me. Its easy and doesn&#x27;t snag at your hair. The quality was good. I would buy again</li>
    <li> Great value for a great price! Love these! They are nice and tight and don&#x27;t stretch out easily.</li>
    <li> Most of them broke the first time I used them.  They must have old dry elastic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used them for years and when you go to the store this exact item is usually 8 or 9 dollars so being able to buy 2 of them for that price is great! I can buy 2 of these and have them last me like a year :)  Unlike other brands they don&#x27;t stretch out as easily and you can use them multiple times.</li>
    <li> I can never keep up with these things and this was the perfect solution! Such a big amount for a great price!</li>
    <li> With 2 little kids I wear my hair up everyday, these are the only hair ties I use. When I run out I just go buy a new pack, they do get stretched out after extended use and sometimes the elastic pops loose from the glue but I&#x27;ve been a faithful use for years.</li>
    <li> If you use a lot of these I highly suggest you buy them in this bulk package, it saves trips to the store and you never have to worry about having a spare.</li>
    <li> Love the size and thickness of this item for my hair as someone with very thick hair. Indeed keeps my hair up.</li>
    <li> I love these hair ties. This isn&#x27;t my first time buying them. They stay in my hair great and are pretty durable and it usually takes a few months before they lose their elasticity. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them catching on my hair.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you I thought I would never find these again!!! I have thick hair and usually the scüncii ones either break or lose elasticity and don&#x27;t hold, they just stretch out and never get back to form and they are horrible.  BUT THESE ARE THE ONES I LOVE!!! Goody scrunchies are the best for my hair, some of them pop but trust me since there are 70 the ones that pop at the first try don&#x27;t really matter because the rest are HIGH QUALITY.  I will never buy any other type of hair scrunchies other than these.</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter like these and it&#x27;s great to have them on hand.</li>
    <li> Great quality. They just don&#x27;t stretch as much as some of my others. It&#x27;s hard to get that 3rd twist in.</li>
    <li> Let me just start off by saying I&#x27;m an African American woman with shoulder length type 4 natural hair. I use these bands to section my natural hair as i style or to section off my braids (extensions) when i oil my scalp. When I first received these bands, I&#x27;m not gonna lie, I was regretful. They seemed too small to hold my thick curly hair. But what I found is that I had to stretch it out manually and then they were perfect. So if you have thinner hair, these might be the bands for you because they take a while and a lot of force to stretch out. However, girls with thick hair, don&#x27;t get discouraged! Once you succeed to stretch it out, it feels like the bands were custom made for you. And let me tell you, these bands are strong and wont break on you which was a HUGE surprise to me how much they could take.&lt;br /&gt;Another plus: These bands go a long way. I&#x27;ve had them for months and have probably only gone through 7 of them in all honesty, that includes giving a couple away to friends. I won&#x27;t have to repurchase any time soon and even if I do, $5 for year(s) worth of headbands is a brilliant investment.</li>
    <li> Had this multi pack for more than three months. I have them spread out all over the house, none have been broken. They last and there are a ton of them. Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> I had about 9 pop on me these morning but.. there ok, generally.</li>
    <li> Work great, last a while</li>
    <li> IN LOVE WITH THE SCRUNCHY. Is very hard to break.</li>
    <li> Works as intended and advertised. Not sure how many uses I get from each one but they last me a pretty long time - it takes me a while before I have to grab a new one. I have really thick hair and these elastics help hold them in place. Will keep buying this brand. They do snap and loosen over time but for the number of elastics I get and the amount of money spent, I&#x27;d say it is reasonably price and sturdy enough.</li>
    <li> Good quality! I test my hair ties before using them, and the pass my stretch test!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and even though scrunchies tend to break easily, I have found that these last the longest. Plus 70 count for $5 was a steal. That&#x27;s usually what I pay for 20 count. So I got two packs.</li>
    <li> His hair is thick and long and since he wear a ponytail he say they stay firm on his hair without tangles.</li>
    <li> I am in the Military and need my hair up EVERYDAY and these things are about 8 dollars at any store! They just take a little stretching out then they are perfect!</li>
    <li> I occasionally get one band that is so strong as the rest, but fr the price its still worth it.</li>
    <li> These hair bands are great for keeping hair out of my face, and because of my occupation I have to wear my hair up everyday. When you use the band for the first time they are really tight. Yes, over time they will stretch out but if you buy a pack of 70, they last for years! I have a bunch of hair. It&#x27;s not thick but I do have alot. I usually use 2 at a time and rotate them frequently so I don&#x27;t experience the stretching and breaking that others have reported. I think I misplace them more often than having one break on me. My cats tend to steal them and hide them under furniture.  After about 4-6 months, I may have a few bands break but if you don&#x27;t try and use the same bands daily or use them on wet hair, you won&#x27;t have to buy another pack for 2 to 3 years. I bought this pack last year and share this pack with my grandmother (who only use 1 band at a time), and I have not even used a quarter of the pack. I figure I&#x27;ll have to make another purchase of 70 bands in 2015. Well worth the money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> It  came with white dandruff looking stuff inside it and some don&#x27;t stretch like the real &amp;#34;Goody&amp;#34; ones. It was opened already and was ripped they had to tape it.</li>
    <li> These really are the best elastics out there. Ouchless, with no metal parts. And with a house of 3 girls we can&#x27;t have to many of these around.. a great value!</li>
    <li> it is definitely difference from the ones in small package. you cannot expand it as much as with others. won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> nice quality. does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Good price for the amount of these! I&#x27;m always losing mine so its nice to have a big bulk.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have said, these do stretch out quickly, but the price is good. I don&#x27;t expect I&#x27;ll need to buy more soon.</li>
    <li> The only hair ties I use on my thick hair</li>
    <li> good product..they do break fairly frequently..but with me and my daughther&#x27;s curly manes...that is not surprising..plus we lose so many..these large packs are awesome</li>
    <li> I keep finding clumps of my own hair in the &amp;#34;seamless&amp;#34; portion of the band. i don&#x27;t even understand how it happens. This product is poorly designed.</li>
    <li> I bought these because they are gentle on the hair with no metal rings.  They are glued together instead. Nice idea but they break in half!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been said, the price, the price, the price.  Especially for the quantity, can&#x27;t be beat</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, should last me forever.! Plus they are super cheap. +++++</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved these hairties, and buying these as an add-on saved me SO much money for SO many great hairties!</li>
    <li> These ties can really hold my hair without snapping. They don&#x27;t stretch out easily too.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really ouchless. I love it. I gave to all my friends so that they could try it out and get theirs too</li>
    <li> very nicely sized for pony tails and are indeed &#x27;ouchless&#x27;. Will order more when needed and would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Best hairbands, hands down.</li>
    <li> These elastics have no metal that can and does get tangled in your hair, don&#x27;t get me wrong, hair still gets tangled, but a lot less with these.&lt;br /&gt;They work beter with prople who have thicker hair... keep elasticity well</li>
    <li> Sometimes the white elastic comes apart though the black outer covering stays together so it still works to hold my hair in a ponytail. Otherwise, this product works well for me and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out.</li>
    <li> These are by far our favorite elastics.  No pulls, no tangles, and they can keep a thick ponytail up all day long!</li>
    <li> 2 out of every 5 of them come apart where they are glued. They are not good quality hair bands.</li>
    <li> Buy these in bulk you won&#x27;t be mad you did. Between my two girls and I we go through these like nobody&#x27;s business. My 4 year old wears them as bracelets and my 11 year old seems to think she needs a new one every time she needs a pony tails. They are good quality and by far my favorite!  As long as Amazon keeps a good price on them, I&#x27;ll keep buying them.</li>
    <li> These are just like the scrunchies you can buy in the store, but its a mega pack. Love the cost and quality!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t yank out my hair as others do. Quality seemed a less durable than the ones I bought in store (20/pack at target).&lt;br /&gt;I find that the thickness of my hair tied up into a ponytail is about 1 inch in diameter. It goes around three times for a tight fit. After stretching it, i.e. wrapping a messy bun, just once, the elastic is lost. If I just stick to the regular hair tying, then I could use it many many times. I also, have yet to find another brand to replace this one yet.</li>
    <li> Love these because they don&#x27;t snag my hair. It is annoying when the fabric breaks exposing the elastic part though. But whatever I&#x27;ll deal with it.</li>
    <li> The elastic hairbands were delivered on time and were in a sealed package. Be aware that the elastic bands are really tight, like an inch in diameter. It&#x27;s almost as if they are meant for small girls, and not a grown adult. Other than that, they stretched out fair quickly. This is in comparison to the same product sold at retail stores. There&#x27;s really no difference in price between the retail product and one sold here. I bought it for convenience since it was delivered.</li>
    <li> Good product and I liked that you can get them in larger quantities that in a store for a similar price</li>
    <li> Awesome price for such good quality hair ties</li>
    <li> Love this brand. Doesn&#x27;t stretch out super fast like other brands.</li>
    <li> I use this every time I opt for ponytails!</li>
    <li> The price was good. However, the issue was they weren&#x27;t the right kind. When I purchased this product, I made sure to get the ones that said &amp;#34;Little Black Dress&amp;#34; because they hold better in my hair for some reason. It did say that, but I got the one the picture shows. I know what I purchased, because I can&#x27;t find them in stores.</li>
    <li> Very strong bands- my daughter and I have long hair. Never gets stuck / tangled. They are super tight in the beginning &amp; do stretch out but not in a bad way. Gets easier to wrap around.</li>
    <li> Very nice ones! No metal. No break in hair!</li>
    <li> (Input from my tween daughter) This is a very good hair care brand, all of their products that I have tried have worked out very well. When I saw this pack, I bought some straight away. They are very durable, I can put my hair up in the morning, and it wont come down till I tell it to. I do flips, cartwheels,and I run around in them, and they will still not budge, I have very, thick, very long hair, and I am your average teen. I am very surprised that they can stay in this long. I am very pleased with this product. I would buy this again if I needed too.</li>
    <li> Got them as a gag gift for the special lady and she couldn&#x27;t have been happier. She says this is the brand she gets and needs more already. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Great price for the bulk quantity of these!  I&#x27;m always losing them.</li>
    <li> They are very durable, it do stretch after a couple uses but its worth every penny. I would recommend these.</li>
    <li> I usually buy the cheap dollar store hair elastics, and as expected, they wear out somewhat fast. So I picked up a pack of Goody elastics thinking they would last longer. WRONG. They snap within days! Literally like one or two days within taking one off the package! WTH is the point? They feel like they have no stretch, so when you wrap one around your fingers to put in your hair, pow! It&#x27;s ruined. In comparison, the cheap dollar store elastics now feel like high quality! And those merely lose their elasticity gradually, which is a lot easier to deal with than a completely snapped band. I will go back to replacing my hair band once every week or two, not every single day!</li>
    <li> Great! THese are strong - NONE have broken and I have gone through about half the bag (Where DO they all disappear to??) WIll buy again</li>
    <li> I love goody hair-ties! They last a long time and are a good quality. And there is a lot in the package.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and a lot of it. These are the only bands that can keep up, and they don&#x27;t hurt my hair.</li>
    <li> These work great and don&#x27;t get stuck in your hair. Will buy these again when I see them for this price.</li>
    <li> These are great quality.  They are really strong and are stretchy enough for a ponytail but not so stretchy that you have to wind it multiple times around.  I didn&#x27;t think there was much of a difference in quality of hair elastics until I got these.  These are definitely better!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t buy anything but Goody.  I use these for cheer bows and they last a very long time, and there are usually only a couple per package that aren&#x27;t stretchy enough.  Rarely do they snap.</li>
    <li> Very good, typical Goody.  Holds my ponytail well. Oh &amp; my cats  like them too...</li>
    <li> how do two daughter and a wife go through so many of these things?</li>
    <li> Theses break really easily. There are a lot of them for the price, so I suppose that makes up for it, but not great quality.</li>
    <li> They are as advertised yet I have had 4 of them break while attempting to use it for the first time. I suspect they have slightly different standards of thickness.</li>
    <li> I have a very active job and very thick, unruly hair. Just ONE of these holds my hair back all day. Most other brands I need to use 2-3 and I still have to mess with it every 20 minutes. The elastic in these is very strong and holds hair very tightly. I haven&#x27;t had a single one snap while putting it on. These are the BEST hair ties I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I received a bad batch but 2 out of 3 snapped when I used them for the first time and probably got 2-3 more uses out of the ones that didn&#x27;t snap.</li>
    <li> Great rubber bands, good quality.</li>
    <li> Years of my life spent wrestling with knotty, unruly hair had left me a shaky nervous wreck.  Ponytails were the bane of my existence.  I would put my hair up, wincing in sharp agony every time I had to twist the rubber band around the handful of hair.&lt;br /&gt;But now, in the words of the wonderful Ms. Blige, no more drama!&lt;br /&gt;I have Goody ouchless pillow pack black elastics!&lt;br /&gt;The black is wonderful because it blends into my hair, making my ponytail look totally natural.&lt;br /&gt;The pillow pack is wonderful because when my daughter&#x27;s doll is missing her pillow, she can use my pillow pack.&lt;br /&gt;The 70-count is wonderful because when one snaps from being wrapped around a too-thick handful of hair, I have another one at the ready.&lt;br /&gt;And ouchless?  Yes indeed!  It doesn&#x27;t pull out my hair or yank at it uncomfortably.&lt;br /&gt;This brand sure lives up to its name - to quote my baby girl, &amp;#34;goody, goody gumdrops!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great little package of rubberbands for cheaper than the store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought them before and thought they were great.  This last batch snapped almost 30% of the time! So Disappointing.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t stretch very much. I have broken about 1/3 of each one I&#x27;ve attempted to use.</li>
    <li> These hair ties are way too tight... and they break when you try to stretch them out. I won&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, no metal, great for thick or long hair. Awesome value for what you pay and how many you get.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy. I am always losing hair ties and pay the same price for a package of maybe 12 or so(?) at the store so this was a good deal for me.</li>
    <li> wow - i finally will never run out of hair ties! I&#x27;ve been using these for years and they are the best brand (last long/limited stretching out). and this price is WAY better than buying smaller packs in the store</li>
    <li> These are hefty and they last well. No metal clips, so they don&#x27;t rip your hair out.</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE. I have been searching high and low for a decent hair tie that wont break and lets me wrap around my lions mane at least 3 times! This is it It&#x27;s the one! If you are someone like me who has long, wavy, thick hair, then this is the one for you!! Im still on my 1st one and I purchased these about a month or 2 ago. I wear my hair up every day so these are perfect. This package might last me the rest of my life. Very Pleased.</li>
    <li> They do the job they are designed to do but they stretchout very quickly. I continue to buy them because I havn&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
    <li> Work really well on my thick hair. They do eventually stretch out and the my hair gets wrapped around the seam. Slide right out of my hair when I go to take my hair down.</li>
    <li> Sometimes they break if you stretch them too much when you’re about to wear them, but apart from that, they’re great.</li>
    <li> These will always be my go to rubber bands. Nothing else can compare. The price is awesome as well!! ;)</li>
    <li> These are the best hair ties. And Amazon has them for such a good price!</li>
    <li> Love having an abundance of these and these are best value x quality I&#x27;ve found. I have really thick hair and these are perfect - just wrap around twice to secure. Haven&#x27;t had any break so far.</li>
    <li> fast shipping. awesome quality</li>
    <li> My cat digs these things. Best cat toy ever!</li>
    <li> These are too small to have on my wrist. I am stretching them out currently on a glass. But just pulling them over the glass, some are already showing some rips in the material around the rubber. And to think I now have 70 of &#x27;em. Yay!</li>
    <li> These are the best elastic out there. They do not have the metal clip that normally gets stuck in my hair. They are thick and able to hold my ponytail well.</li>
    <li> Perfect - great deal!</li>
    <li> these hair ties are durable and does not break that easily. and it really does not hurt or pull out my hair</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair that tends to wind around elastics and tangle (and then get ripped out).  These elastics are the only ones I&#x27;ve found that don&#x27;t contribute to hair loss.  They have a nice look and are appropriate for elastic using styles beyond the basic pony tail.</li>
    <li> Goody makes the best ponys.  I have a cheer bow business and go through at least 100 of these a month.  Fantastic</li>
    <li> Great price and quality</li>
    <li> Pretty good for the price.  Doesn&#x27;t grab hair. Only complaint is that some of them break immediately on the first use.</li>
    <li> Always have to have these around the house and in the car. also a good deal on subscribe and save vs. going to local beauty store or pharmacy to pick these up. work great and last pretty long</li>
    <li> I find the Goody hair ties in the stores to be of better quality.  Some of the ones from this box split pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> My pony tail is thick and the smaller size did not last from being stretched out.  These look to be better suited to multiple windings on my hair.</li>
    <li> Item is as description says, does what it is supposed to. Keeps hair in place, good elasticity.  stays put, even through hard workout and lots of movement and jumping. Good price, shipping was on time. Another good item and purchase, thanks amazon</li>
    <li> For a man that has long hair and works every day at a business were hats and ponytail are required for long hair fyi McDonald&#x27;s. These are perfect and cost effective. Curly &amp; wavey hair here! researched this purchase extremely. But them.</li>
    <li> They are ok but a few broke with first use</li>
    <li> For the price you get a ton of bands but they stretch out quickly and do not last. I have to get a new one every couple days. Not satisfied with the quality but like I said you get so many that you can afford to keep getting a new one out sooner than most. This is unusual for Goody, I have been buying this brand for many years and never ran into this problem. Could be a known defect so they sold them to company&#x27;s for penny&#x27;s to just get rid of them?????</li>
    <li> loving it, rarely can find bands that are strong enough for loc&#x27;s but this  brand had hold my hair so far and is very strong</li>
    <li> I love this type of hairbands. I find that the metal ones break too easy and these hold up well. They are a great buy (especially since I seem to be forever losing my hair bands).</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about my girls saing ooch or I&#x27;m in pain when I take out he hair ties and they hold really well.</li>
    <li> All the curlies rave about this product but instead of a metal band it looks like the ends are burned together and my hair wraps around this part. Granted it&#x27;s not nearly as much as it would with a non ouchless but still I thought NO hair would get caught in this..</li>
