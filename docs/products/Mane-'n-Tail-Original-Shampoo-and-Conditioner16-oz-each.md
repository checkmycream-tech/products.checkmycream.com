<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo and conditioner !!! Does a wonderful job!!! Cleans as well as gives body!!!</li>
    <li> Seems ok at first but is kinda like a poor mans version of wen where you get the same problems with hair not feeling totally clean after few days of use, but doesn&#x27;t condition as well as wen does.</li>
    <li> Not a typical lathering shampoo. Left my hair feeling kind of greasy and weighed down. Won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
    <li> It works really well and smells great. I have ethnic hair and it&#x27;s difficult to find products that work well, but this is one for sure</li>
    <li> I use it on my dog who has very dry skin and course hair. It really helps relieve the itching and leaves her hair soft.</li>
    <li> As I rinsed the shampoo from my hear it squeaked. Wow clean. Conditioner is not like thick but my hair is soft. My hair is never soft. 😕 I like it.</li>
    <li> smells great! it makes my hair noticeably soft, it reduces breakage, and I&#x27;ve gotten completes on how long my hair has grown! no, it&#x27;s not going to make your hair grow 5 inches a week, but maybe an inch and a half to two inches. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different- and this, I feel, is the solution to clean, healthy hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for the past year or so on and off and I honestly feel like my hair has been much healthier. The reason I use it on and off is because after one big bottle (32oz are the bottles i&#x27;ve been using after my first 16oz) I switch to a new shampoo and conditioner. I do this because I feel like my hair gets used to the product and that makes it not have the same affect anymore. Other than that, i love the shampoo and the moisture and health it brings to my hair. This has made my hair grow much faster. About 1 cm more than the average monthly growth.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff does shampoo remove all dirt and debris from my dogs hair and the conditioner stops the itching can&#x27;t beat the price cheaper than Walmart</li>
    <li> I got a Kertin treatment and was concerned about my hair. The Kertin straightened my hair, but after a few treatment, I noticed my hair starting to split and have dead ends and cracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product, given it has sulfate, I was reluctant that it would damage my hair. I wasn&#x27;t concerned about frizz. I feel my hair soft. My hair is has been oily at the top and dry at the bottom. I have middle length hair and it is rare to find a conditioning shampoo and conditioner than balances my hair. I notice my ends are not as dry and slightly less oiliness.</li>
    <li> Please be aware of where you are buying your products from. I made the mistake of thinking this would be the same as buying from mane n tail, but it&#x27;s not. I don&#x27;t think this shampoo and conditioner are in new condition at all. I&#x27;ve only used it a few time but each time the shampoo texture was more of a jello feel. I also noticed that my hair has gotten so much frizz right after using it. I wish I had just ordered from their website instead. I&#x27;m not going to return because it&#x27;ll prob cost me more than I would get as a refund.</li>
    <li> I saw immediate results (as in CONSIDERABLY less hairfall) after my first shower using the thing. What sorcery is this???</li>
    <li> I used twice ! It&#x27;s really heavy and oily ! Had to wash my hair with regular shampoo. The conditioner made my hair dry !!!</li>
    <li> Good shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> Does seem to make my hair feel thicker and has slowed down the hair loss.</li>
    <li> I used this 20 years ago. On a whim, I thought I would try it again. I have fine hair and I was concerned it might be a little more harsh than I needed these days. I&#x27;m glad I tried it. My hair feels like silk. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Its ok, doesn&#x27;t give the growth that I was told it might help with</li>
    <li> So what I got was a 12oz shampoo and a 16oz condition, what a rip off.  I had it when people advertise one thing and then send you another.  The shampoo and conditioner are fine.  I&#x27;m told they give great results, but it is too soon for me to say.</li>
    <li> After using this shampoo and conditioner, my hair grew longer than its been since I was 15 years old (roughly 15 years ago). This stuff is serious though...try not to get any of it in your eyes; it will burn like crazy. Also, the conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave the hair as silky and smooth as other conditioners I&#x27;ve used in the past. But overall, if I was trying to grow my hair out again, I&#x27;d buy this in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> Left flakes and residue in my hair. The shampoo was a jello like consistency (doesnt seem normal at all). Also my friend said hers lathers really well and this doesnt lather at all, it hits my hair and just dries out. Got frizzy and dry hair after 3 washes and Im not happy at all. I have curly/wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I was to buy a growl shampoo and wrongly bought this. But it doesn&#x27;t cause much hair loss as well. However, my roommate says that it makes her hair oily, so if your hair gets oily easily, don&#x27;t choose it. Otherwise, it is an excellent shampoo for you.</li>
    <li> Felt great after first use!</li>
    <li> Noticed an improvement in hair thickness quality (I have very fine hair)</li>
    <li> I definitely saw my hair growing a little quicker. Try to lather and leave in your hair for a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I mainly got this product because I wanted to grow my hair out fast to get dreads. While I was somewhat bummed it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;speed up&amp;#34; the hair growth process, it has done wonders to my hair! The conditioner is one that gives you the option of a &amp;#34;rinse out&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; method. at first I used the rinse out method because that&#x27;s what I normally do but I was impressed with the results from rubbing in some conditioner in before I went the bed. Results didn&#x27;t show until the next evening when I got my hair wet and let it dry. My hair was a lot smoother and less oily. I&#x27;ve also noticed less hair falling out (before, I could take out 7-10 hairs by just slightly pulling at it). For those of you wanting to grow your hair out, this product won&#x27;t speed it up, but still make your hair feel amazing!</li>
    <li> It does makes my hair shiny , even only after one use ! But I didn&#x27;t get the clean feeling , I still felt my hair dirty or had a weird smell I can&#x27;t exactly describe it.&lt;br /&gt;I used both the shampoo and conditioner .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles didn&#x27;t come sealed properly , so it was spilt a little bit .</li>
    <li> Everyone raved about it. It&#x27;s definitely made for horses. It left my hair feeling more than dry.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see or feel a difference.</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;m not going to lie, when Will Ferrell&#x27;s character Chazz Michael Michaels&#x27; in Blades of Glory credits his hair to &amp;#34;Mane &#x27;n Tail&amp;#34;, I thought it was a joke.  &amp;#34;Help yourself to the Mane n&#x27; Tail all you want, but don&#x27;t even look at the Verticoli... &amp;#34;  {Did I really just make the first reference to Chazz in all of these reviews?}  But, turns out I was wrong.  The stuff is for real, it is marketed to people, and it works great.  I can&#x27;t vouch for some of the claims regarding reversing hair loss, as I&#x27;ve got a pretty thick head of hair anyway.  The combination of shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair feeling clean and manageable, without being weighted down.  Ok, I&#x27;m done talking about beauty products and hair care secrets for now.  Time to review the Smith&#x27;s Tri-Hone knife sharpener, and restore some of my credibility...</li>
    <li> Works wonders and definitely makes hair more soft and manageable. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for better shampoo and conditioner on a budget.</li>
    <li> I have lots of hair &amp; generally untangle it in the shower. The shampoo smells great &amp; so does the conditioner.  The bottles are smaller than what you&#x27;d find at Walgreens or Rite Aid.  But I wanted to try them &amp; I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> Ok, so very skeptical at first but decided to give it a try. Mind you, when i started it was 2 weeks ago. my hair was a little below my shoulders, now it is all the way down to my breasts!! super love this product! my hair is softer than ever and i don&#x27;t even have to blow dry it or straighten it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE THAT WANTS TO GROW HAIR!!</li>
    <li> i love this shampoo.I have very thin hair after using this shampoo they are looking better and they are shining.it was the first time i ordered it and i can say that is quite good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with my hair shedding an inordinate amount every single day. I used to have really thick straight hair when I was younger and over the years, it&#x27;s just thinned out. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of shampoos and conditioners and none of them worked. Then my mom&#x27;s friend recommended mane n tail for my hair and it worked like a miracle. I noticed that hair stopped shedding as much as it did before (just the normal amount that your hair is supposed to shed), it got thicker, shinier, bouncier, everything that you want your hair to look like. For me, it really is the best shampoo and conditioner combo out there.</li>
    <li> the shampoo and conditioner were all over the place I expected to get them full and and new instead they&#x27;re opened and have some missing</li>
    <li> I have horses, but actually bought these for me--my hair is so shiny and silky without being waxy. I get compliments all the time and people can&#x27;t believe what I use as my hair secret weapon.  I also use it as a leave-in conditioner for my horses to prevent split ends!  :)</li>
    <li> After my first use with these my hair felt thicker and stronger and even looked like it! I will continue use in hopes of having better looking hair</li>
    <li> If the conditioner didn&#x27;t contain yellow dyes that colored my hair, I would really like this product. People with darker hair probably won&#x27;t notice, and people wanting to color their grays might appreciate it.</li>
    <li> This product may not have a real nice scent, however it does not stink. It works well if you are looking to have your hair grow and and thickened.</li>
    <li> I had heard of  mane &#x27;n tail from a friend of mine. She claimed to have gotten thicker, nicer hair from the shampoo and conditioner alone. I was not looking to thicken my hair--my hair is a thick, coarse, curly/wavy texture so thickness was never an issue. However, my hair was not as strong as it used to be. I purchased the smaller size of shampoo and conditioner for testing purposes. The shampoo is absolutely great! It lathers, and feels great on and rinsed from hair. The conditioner is a bit odd; at first appearance it looks nothing like the conditioner I had been used to applying to my hair. Nonetheless, I gave them both a try. After only 2 weeks (I wash my hair maybe 2-3 times a week), my hair was noticeably stronger and shinier. My hair is more manageable now as well. It just feels great! i would recommend trying this out to anyone who wants stronger hair. Even if you don&#x27;t want stronger hair, just give it a try. You&#x27;ve got nothing to lose.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, but after two uses and trying different techniques, I&#x27;m left with incredibly greasy hair. Tried rinsing all the conditioner out but it&#x27;s still greasy.</li>
    <li> Great product pricing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Caucasian - regular/thin hair - short/chin length. I used these products for about a week....and couldn&#x27;t handle it anymore. After showering my hair didn&#x27;t feel clean like it has with my previous shampoo/conditioner and a couple times after drying my hair I had to go back and re-shampoo my hair because it didn&#x27;t clean out all my hairspray gunk. The times when I did not need to re-wash, my hair had a weird texture to it, kind of oily but straw like. I would use about a quarter-half dollar size amount &amp; would vigorously massage it all over my scalp and through my hair. And when rinsing I would do the same thing to ensure it was all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would give this a try to help my hair grow faster/thicker/stronger, like some reviewers and people I know have said....but honestly- unless I got a bad batch, this stuff isn&#x27;t worth it. And I wouldn&#x27;t use it for animals either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep searching for that miracle &#x27;poo. I am going back to using Redkin Intra Force. It&#x27;s pricey but definitely better than this.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo and conditioner. Both my husband and I use these and are very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I use this on my color treated hair about every other day. I also use it on my Bella (horse) about once every 10 days. And it also gets used on Lilly (4 month old maltese puppy) every week or so. It is amazing. I love it. Have been using it for years. Much better price on amazon as opposed to the store. It leaves my hair, my Bella&#x27;s mane, and Lilly&#x27;s hair feeling like a million bucks. I&#x27;d say Lilly gets the more compliments than Bella and I. Mainly on how amazing she smells after a bath. I love it. BUY IT! You won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> MOVE OVER MR. ED!  i have been using your shampoo and conditioner.  I don&#x27;t neigh and I don&#x27;t cantor, but my hair is clean and shiney and that is what matters!  Well, who would of &amp;#34;thunk&amp;#34; it!</li>
    <li> Never used this before and now I will never use anything else. It left my hair amazingly soft after one use. NO frizz! I didn&#x27;t even have to add product! It doesn&#x27;t smell bad either! Great product, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> it was really good and make my hair grow faster. But it may be too dry</li>
    <li> First of all, this stuff is voluminous as heck, BUT it doesn&#x27;t do much for your hair in terms of moisturizing or keeping frizz down, so you&#x27;re battling the big hair with lots of frizz without even teasing it. It lasts forever!</li>
    <li> This shampoo damage my hair so much and i had to cut it</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome and really makes my hair stronger and grow faster!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I can literally feel it clean as I scrub my hair. The conditioner leaves my hair feeling very smooth, not quite as good as treseme, but still very good. Excellent product that I will likely continue to use.</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo very much. It did make my hair get longer very fastly. However, personally think the shampoo and conditioner are not moisture enough for my hair</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner is one of the better ones on the market. I personally use it as my backup beard shampoo and have always found it to be very effective. 4/5</li>
    <li> At first I got second thought but when I tryed it. It worked wonderfull I truly love this</li>
    <li> shampoo dried my hair out and the conditioner didnt even untangle what the shampoo did , I would give it minus stars if I could</li>
    <li> I would give the product 5 stars, because it does what it supposed to. It cleans my hair. The reason I gave it 3 is because it doesn&#x27;t work with my fine hair. The product moisturizes and causes my hair to go limp and look greasy in less than 24 hours. I would love to see a volumizing version of Mane and Tail.</li>
    <li> I tried this a few years ago given to me by my sister in a box of hair shampoos and conditioners she didn&#x27;t use/want anymore. At that time my hair was super dry and damaged with split ends. I ended up trying it and didn&#x27;t like it because it felt like it was building up on my hair probably from using too much conditioner and not rinsing thoroughly enough.&lt;br /&gt;Now i came across it again and my hair is healthier than before and it is working more than the last time i used it. I also make sure to really rinse the conditioner out so there&#x27;s no build-up. It leaves my hair with more body (not over the top) but just enough and leaves it shiny and soft. I recently just got my hair cut to my shoulders and I decided to return to this since it claims to aid in healthy hair growth. So far i am really starting to like it and it leaves my hair more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product to anyone that wants to strengthen their hair. I just want to warn to anyone who tries it to make sure they really rinse their hair when rinsing out the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing again when i run out! Thank you Mane n&#x27; Tail :)</li>
    <li> IT WORKS! I&#x27;m going to keep buying Main &amp; Tail. Thanks</li>
    <li> Favorite shampoo ever!</li>
    <li> Not worth the money!  It didn&#x27;t make the hair shiny and smooth.  I won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
    <li> I bought the Shampoo and conditioner in a beauty supply store in my city for $3.99 each for the same size. Needless to say i just washed and conditioned my hair  and can I please say AWESOME. My hair  is so very soft.&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference at all but then again my hair is very damaged</li>
    <li> Not impressed with this product. I wonder if the other reviews are being paid just to sell this product, but i tried it and my experience was completely different, my hair is drier, and i dont even use heat to dry it, it just got that way after using this. My hair used to be softer before i started to use this shampoo and i used to wash it with regular cheap shampoos before!. However, i dont think this is what people are saying in other reviews. Wish it was true but i am definitely not purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Mane &#x27;n Tail Shampoo and Conditioner not only made my hair longer in a short period of time, but it also made it stronger and smell nicer! I have medium thickness long strawberry blonde hair. It&#x27;s like this shampoo and conditioner made my hair plump and pretty!</li>
    <li> For those that don&#x27;t know the story of Mane&#x27;n Tail, the shampoo and conditioners were originally developed for horses and after horse owners reported seeing improvement in the health and appearance of their horses&#x27; manes and tails they decided to try it on themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this shampoo and conditioner.  This shampoo keeps my hair feeling moist and clean and for those with really long hair prevents your hair from being brittle and breakage and the conditioner feels light and leaves no residue behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good quality shampoo and conditioner without all the chemicals that other products tend to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great products, although I would suggest shopping around price wise as you can find the large individual bottles of these for around 6 bucks or so each in the big box stores.  Sometimes though you have to look in the pet section, but don&#x27;t worry that is the same shampoo and conditioner in the same bottles that they sell in the human section.</li>
    <li> First, I used this product in the shower and i hated it and it&#x27;s really hard to squeeze out for one and for two i got the wrong product I got the herbal gro in the mail and it was only 12 oz! WASTE OF MONEY &amp;#62;:(((</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been growing my hair for a year now and haven&#x27;t had long hair since I was a teenager. I tried many different recommendations but this product is BY FAR a superior product! Straightened my curls and made my hair feel just GREAT! I think it actually made my hair grow faster(???)...</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Works great!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser kept telling me how much better the condition of my hair was. the only thing I had done different was use Mane&#x27;n Tail. We were BOTH impressed !</li>
    <li> A friend had recommended this product in church. So I purchased for my mother in law who had some bald spots on her head for the past 20 years. Well after two months of use, her hair is growing. Where the bald spots where, are little sprouts of hair coming up! If I didn&#x27;t see if happen with my own eyes, I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed her hair is thicker and a bit more fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My MIL is over 60 and has spent hundreds on products that didn&#x27;t help. Can&#x27;t believe this worked and we are so excited.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> Little expense but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Can you send that for me here in Brazil???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Mane &#x27;n Tail Shampoo is an exclusive, high-lathering horse shampoo containing cleansing agents fortified with moisturizers and emollients. Rich fragrant lather provides \\&quot;down to the skin\\&quot; cleansing action. pH balanced formula provides optimum body, shine and manageability. Micro enriched protein formula conditions leaving hair soft and shiny. Regular use enhances coat health and appearance. Original Mane &#x27;n Tail Conditioner Formulated as a topical conditioner. Combined ingredients are utilized to support nature&#x27;s hair growth to achieve a longer, healthier mane and tail.</li>
    <li> Mane &#x27;n Tail is probably one of the most magical substances on the face of the earth. Is that a bit of an overstatement? I mean, yes, but it really comes down to what your definition of magical is. Mane &#x27;n Tale wasn&#x27;t really originally a human shampoo; it was made for horses. The equestrian owners, however, saw how wonderfully the stuff worked for their four-legged riding companions, and began to use it for their own hair. Now, I&#x27;ve tried lots of shampoos. I have really weird hair that doesn&#x27;t like to grow once it reaches just past my shoulders. Also, it has that kinda-curly, kinda-wavy, kinda-not-anything thing going on. In order to get it to behave, I&#x27;ve used a wide array of products that probably were not worth the money that I oh-so-willingly spent on them. Recently, however, when I was complaining to my friend that my hair would not grow no matter what I did or didn&#x27;t do to it (I had read somewhere online that if you washed your hair only twice a week it would grow twice as fast. Needless to say, it didn&#x27;t really work.), she told me about this fantastic horse shampoo that she had used, claiming that her hair had grown a good inch or two in the past month. Now, my friend is pretty weird, so I was only mildly flabbergasted when she said she was using a product that was meant for animals. She assured me, however, that it was also appropriate for human use. Besides, I was swayed by the fact that it could be bought at Rite Aid and that its cost was negligible. After using the shampoo for months, I can genuinely say that my friend was absolutely right. Before Mane &#x27;n Tale, my hair was not going to grow. I had accepted it for a fact that my hair would never be long. This shampoo works like nothing else. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in these bottles, but its kind of life changing. Don&#x27;t be deterred by the fact that it&#x27;s for horses.</li>
    <li> Its really great. My hair feels super soft for few days. I will be buying it again in future. Great</li>
    <li> I have purchased so many different shampoos (many expensive and recommended by so called experts. I am 75 and because of age or medication (who knows) I was losing a great deal of hair every time I wash it (daily) my Dr who has the same problem told me to try Mane n Tail.  I did and I have to tell you there is a great improvement.  Of course my Dr recommended just because she also loved it - not because of any medical  knowledge. I have given away all other shampoos - I also  switch between the original shampoo and conditioner and the Herbal Gro.  LOVE them both - my hair also looks young and shines which seems to be hard for my graying dish water blond  color</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed in this product! I was so excited to get this and use it! But sadly I wasn&#x27;t able to continue the use. It left my hair dry with no shine. My other conditioner use to leave my hair soft with no tangles. I can say I will not finish using this product or recommend it</li>
    <li> Ordered the mane n tail, but Did not receive the shampoo! Got some other BS shampoo dont know what to do</li>
    <li> I started using this in place of my expensive salon brand shampoo and my hair feels really soft and shiny, even more so than before. I read bad reviews about the conditioner but bought it because they came together. I like using my own deep conditioning treatments, so I can&#x27;t review the conditioner but I like the shampoo!</li>
    <li> love this product have used this for many years. great product. it really works as they say. thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I ordered this a while back and I don&#x27;t remember what seller it was but I do not recommend it if you have thin hair that easily damages. My hair has been falling out so much! Everyone I shower  A LOT of hair falls off. This is the only shampoo and conditioner I use. I don&#x27;t use any other products on my hair. I don&#x27;t know if this is the reason my hair is falling, but I began to notice my hair falling when I began using this. Also I was sent 2 shampoos instead of one and one.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo  and  conditioner. Leaves my hair feeling  so clean.</li>
    <li> I love Mane n tail so much. My friends asked me that my how is my hair growing  so quickly now haha.</li>
    <li> Made my hair tough like a horses. What I wanted</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for ways to make my hair grow and I started a regimen of 10,000 mcg of Biotin plus this shampoo and conditioner after a suggestion from an acquaintance. I searched a good bit for the best deal for this as it can be pretty expensive and most places wanted to charge an excessive amount for shipping. This was the best deal I found, not only was it cheaper than the others it came very quickly without costing a ton for S&amp;H. I&#x27;m very happy with it and can&#x27;t wait to see how well it works over then next few months.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Worth every cent spent!</li>
    <li> First let me say you get a lot in these bottles. Second the smell isn&#x27;t strong or anything like that, neutral really so that&#x27;s nice and what I do smell it smells good. Now for the rest. I bleach my hair, bleach it from a dark color to a pale blonde and I do it often because I dye my hair wild colors (like purple). These kept my hair healthy. It doesn&#x27;t thicken your hair but it keeps it healthy which in a way keeps your hair strong. I&#x27;ve used other shampoos and conditioners and my hair would be brittle but this stuff, in my opinion, has helped prevent that. I would buy these again. I&#x27;ve had them for 2-3 months now (maybe longer). I love this product.</li>
    <li> It has a very pleasant smell. works up a good lather and makes my hair looks soft, shiny and wonderful.</li>
    <li> I love this product works great on my thick hair</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner.  My hair is very thing and fragile and since using this my hair is thicker an healthier.  I love it.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this stuff!! She has fine, blonde hair and it air dries nicely after using these products</li>
    <li> My son loves this shampoo and conditioner.  I was thrilled to be able to purchase it at Amazon.  This combination leaves his hair clean and manageable.  He works in a fast food restaurant so you can imagine the amount of grease he comes home in.  I know I can buy this at local stores, but being able to order through Amazon is so much simpler.</li>
    <li> my wife loves this product and will be purchasing it again!</li>
    <li> Just got mine in the mail today and just used it. It made my hair feel super silky. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because some of it leaked out so I had to rinse the bottles off.</li>
    <li> I have been used this for 4 days and my hair has already grown a full inch. It makes my hair feel so much smoother too!!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it was truly made for horses but....SO WHAT. If you want your hair to grow then there&#x27;s nothing wrong with using it (it smells fine).&lt;br /&gt;When you apply the shampoo your hair may get a little knotty but once you apply the conditioner your knots will be gone.&lt;br /&gt;If you want even faster hair growth results with this (things I&#x27;ve been doing) :&lt;br /&gt;1.) Don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday, do it every other day (just wetting it everyday is fine)&lt;br /&gt;2.) Put 1-2 little packs of Knox gelatin (not jello) in each shampoo/conditioner bottle and mix it up.&lt;br /&gt;3.) And as most of you may already know cut it at least once a month</li>
    <li> Awesome thickens up my lifeless flat hair!</li>
    <li> Ship fast and good quality</li>
    <li> This really stops hair from falling out! Doesn&#x27;t help it grow in, but stops it from falling out.</li>
    <li> I love it! My hair is unruly and curly but this products makes my hair actually manageable! As for hair growth I&#x27;m not sure because I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks but my hair does look like its grown half an inch since usage! I will say if you color your hair do not use this shampoo due to the sulfate a that will fade color. I&#x27;ve colored my hair henna and each time I&#x27;ve used this it has faded my henna which is great cause I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid if most of the henna to dye over it!</li>
    <li> At first my daughter loved this stuff but now it seems to be making her hair oilier. Will use less conditioner to see if that helps.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference on my hair</li>
    <li> Amazing, fast shipping great products!</li>
    <li> omg, do not get this in your eyes! This doesn&#x27;t sting in cuts or the skin, but if you get it in your eyes you&#x27;ll be in pain for hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the shampoo is great. The conditioner is a leave-in or rinse conditioner, which is great because it can double as a mild styling product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about the hair growth claims, but this does make my hair feel good and my dry scalp is gone! I plan on buying more!</li>
    <li> The price was a good deal but the product itself didn&#x27;t yield the results I had hoped for. The shampoo dried out my hair and completely stripped it, and the conditioner didn&#x27;t give the results it says. However, I&#x27;ve had it worse. It did make my hair shinier.</li>
    <li> I was not sure what to expect based on the reviews. Some said it didn&#x27;t smell good, others said the conditioner didn&#x27;t leave their hair smooth enough. But, I took my chances and ordered this product. And, I am so glad I did. I love it! The shampoo smell is delightful. I love it. And the conditioner isn&#x27;t any different than all the other more expensive conditioners I&#x27;ve been buying. My hair feels smooth and very manageable. I used  the product two times now and my hair hasn&#x27;t looked or felt better! I know I will come back for more. I am glad I decided to try  it. I recommend Mane &#x27;n Tail wholeheartedly!</li>
    <li> A shampoo. I put both bottles in the shower and then I go to use them and realize their both conditioner. A little angry because now I have 2 conditioners with no shampoo.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize the 16 oz bottle is the small bottle, not the bottle you get at the farm stores.  Thought I was getting a bargain.  Still good stuff though.  Have used it on me, dogs, and horses for years.</li>
    <li> This was well worth my money, really makes your hair strong and makes it grow.</li>
    <li> Very Happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for about 2 weeks now, and I&#x27;ve used them twice. I have nappy curls that I straighten every week after a wash and condition, after a mishap of leaving black hair dye on too long I&#x27;ve lost a good 3 inches of length underneath the top layer of my head, so I purchased this in high hopes the other positive reviews were true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, so the first wash I was a little surprised by the almost gel like consistency of the shampoo, it&#x27;s easy to lather once you get enough in, BUT it is very drying, you almost have no choice but to use the conditioner immediately after. So after that wash I let my hair be curly and air dry over night, the following day I began to straighten it and it looked very greasy at the roots of my hair (I didn&#x27;t have any other product on it and that doesn&#x27;t usually happen.) so I wasn&#x27;t too happy about that, but to my joy it all blended in a couple hours later&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after my second wash a couple days ago, (a week &amp; a half since I started using) my hair is definitely fuller (looking) and it&#x27;s really soft and feels super clean! Haven&#x27;t noticed much growth yet, but It definitely works for the thickness factor. :-) overall a good product, I look forward to keep using.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the many reviews I had read on Amazon and also seen on Youtube, saying it helps with hair growth. I have sen that my hair has grown (because I can see that 1 inch of my true color in the roots), however, I am not sure it is because I have not been blow drying my hair and keeping it from heat. The shampoo and conditioner I believe smell nice and very gentle (not very drying). I would reccommend this to anyone looking to try it out.</li>
    <li> The price was right, so i gave it a shot. I have fine hair that get frizzy, oily, you name it. This shampoo didn&#x27;t seem to get it clean. It left a weird residue and my hair didn&#x27;t keep a style the few times that I used the product. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I have tried different shampoos and conditioners; some were better, some didn&#x27;t quite work with my hair type. My hair is fine, and rather breakable, especially from heat. This product has been amazing in terms of strengthening hair, improving its look and health. I am using this product for a while now, and it&#x27;s awesome! I definitely recommend it (especially if you have fine hair, I am not sure how it is for other types).&lt;br /&gt;I must say that it&#x27;s the best shampoo/conditioner I tried!</li>
    <li> So far I haven&#x27;t seen too much growth because I&#x27;ve just used it for a few times. But I do see that my hair glows and feels smooth after it dries. I will definitely see more results in the future.</li>
