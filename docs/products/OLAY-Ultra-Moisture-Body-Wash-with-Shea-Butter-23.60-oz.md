      <li>Nice fragrance, good lather and non-dryiing</li>
      <li>guests love it and pay it forward!</li>
      <li>&amp; I love it!</li>
      <li>I have no complaints when it comes to leaving the skin moisturized and a nice scent also.</li>
      <li>I went home and ordered my own.</li>
      <li>She says it is the best one she has purchased and makes her skin very soft.</li>
      <li>I got the original (not with Shea) and it works amazing!  </li>
      <li>So far, this is the best body wash I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I used this at my cousins house and loved the smell of it and how clean I felt afterwards.</li>
      <li>This is the favorite body wash of both myself and my husband.</li>
      <li>Love this body soap.  </li>
      <li>I have used Olay for over 30 or more years.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>If the consistency is milky, then it is going to work great - if it is clear or colored, then probably not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and smells great, with a neutral scent that seems neither feminine nor masculine.</li>
      <li>We love that it has Shea Butter that moisturizes while you clean.</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor, which is something I always look out for when I&#x27;m purchasing any beauty product (I have allergies).</li>
      <li>I love the silky smooth feel after my shower and it really moisturizes my skin.  </li>
      <li>It is wonderful for dry and dehydrated skin leaving it feeling soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>this wash, simple, smooth, foaming and luxurious is simply the BEST.  </li>
      <li>that mimics the lipid content of the skin making it easily absorbed by the skin thereby improving moisture retention.</li>
      <li>If you need something to bathe with on a daily basis that isn&#x27;t drying, this is a good product and is reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Every time I step out of the shower, my skin feels so silky, smooth, and brand new.</li>
      <li>This is not the first time I have used this product.  </li>
      <li>only wish is that the wash would have been more moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>scent is great - not overbearing, not too fruity, it&#x27;s actually a breath of fresh air compared to other scented washes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(Maybe I&#x27;m asking too much of the vitamins.)</li>
      <li>Skin is so soft, you can feel the moisture like the fresh dew from a morning mist.</li>
      <li>I have extremely dry skin and am constantly looking for an effective moisturizing body wash.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
      <li>I gave the wash 4 stars because it left my skin feeling clean and not dry, but it would have gotten 5 stars if those vitamins would have kicked in and eliminated the need for lotion after the shower.  </li>
      <li>My skin is moisturized all day long, and it is noticeable within the first two uses.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this body wash</li>
      <li>Apparently there is such a thing as too much Shea Butter, because this product not only left me greasy from head to toe, but also my bath tub.</li>
      <li>(I did not feel moist and soft, just greasy- think French fry.)</li>
      <li>What I like about it is that it does not dry out your skin.  </li>

<li> (I did not feel moist and soft, just greasy- think French fry.)</li>
<li> What I like about it is that it does not dry out your skin.  </li>
<li> bought it because I needed something I could use that wouldn&#x27;t dry out my skin, especially during the winter.</li>
<li> In the winter my skin tends to get dry and once again, this product reduces the dryness.</li>
<li> I searched for body washes and lotions that would help my dry skin, with no luck, until I found this beauty.</li>
<li> I moved recently to a place where it&#x27;s dryer, colder, and less humid.</li>
<li> even ditched my lotion routine because I no longer need to spend the extra money on lotion that didn&#x27;t work half as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I no longer get rough winter skin, and never have to worry about dry skin period.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> This layer of what I am assuming is Shea butter or mineral oil did not readily wipe off but did scrap off with my nails.</li>
<li> /&gt;However, be careful when making your selection.</li>
<li> The next day I decided to take a bath and discovered that that single use had left my entire tub covered in a thick scum of body wash sludge.</li>
<li> I would get a few dry patches and this product eliminated that.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried every soap to help my skin even out from sun exposure,  dark marks, dark undereye circles,  redness, etc.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the product didn&#x27;t leave my skin dry, but I thought that since there were vitamins for extra dry skin, I wouldn&#x27;t have to use lotion after my shower.   </li>
<li> I have tried other Olay washes that weren&#x27;t meant for moisturizing, and they actually dried my skin out.</li>
<li> Even after I have dried off, it feels as though I have already applied lotion to my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I mean, if you&#x27;re going to the trouble of putting vitamins in the formula, then I want my skin to feel like I&#x27;ve put lotion on as well.  </li>
<li> I often won&#x27;t buy things like this unless I know how they smell or make me feel due to some products leaving a filmy feel behind.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this body wash for at least a year</li>
<li> Now maybe I got a bad bottle of body wash or perhaps Wal-Mart is cutting additional corners these days, but my new bottle of Olay Ultra Moisture body wash is now in the trash.</li>
<li> Not only did this layer of body wash feel nasty to stand on or bathe in, it would have been dangerous for anyone unsteady on their feet to stand on (child or elderly person).</li>

    <li> this wash, simple, smooth, foaming and luxurious is simply the BEST.  i have been using it for years and, when there are no sales on it and costco has switched to another &#x27;shiny object&#x27;, i turn to amazon! i get it 6 or so at a time...and keep it in every bath tub/shower in the house! guests love it and pay it forward!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product. She says it is the best one she has purchased and makes her skin very soft.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin and am constantly looking for an effective moisturizing body wash. So, I was looking forward to trying out this Olay Ultra Moisture body wash. Apparently there is such a thing as too much Shea Butter, because this product not only left me greasy from head to toe, but also my bath tub. (I did not feel moist and soft, just greasy- think French fry.) After using this product in the shower, I then had to re-shower with soap to get enough of it off to dress. The next day I decided to take a bath and discovered that that single use had left my entire tub covered in a thick scum of body wash sludge. This layer of what I am assuming is Shea butter or mineral oil did not readily wipe off but did scrap off with my nails. It then took two washings with a scrub sponge to remove. Not only did this layer of body wash feel nasty to stand on or bathe in, it would have been dangerous for anyone unsteady on their feet to stand on (child or elderly person). I have been using Johnson&#x27;s body wash for years (it contains mineral oil) and have never had this problem. In fact, I have never had this issue with any moisturizing body wash. Now maybe I got a bad bottle of body wash or perhaps Wal-Mart is cutting additional corners these days, but my new bottle of Olay Ultra Moisture body wash is now in the trash.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Nice fragrance, good lather and non-dryiing</li>
    <li> If you need something to bathe with on a daily basis that isn&#x27;t drying, this is a good product and is reasonably priced. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I bought it because I needed something I could use that wouldn&#x27;t dry out my skin, especially during the winter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that the wash would have been more moisturizing.  I mean, if you&#x27;re going to the trouble of putting vitamins in the formula, then I want my skin to feel like I&#x27;ve put lotion on as well.

(Maybe I&#x27;m asking too much of the vitamins.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body wash for at least a year &amp; I love it! I have sensitive skin and this body wash doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It also doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor, which is something I always look out for when I&#x27;m purchasing any beauty product (I have allergies). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Luxurious body wash, it feels so good! I love the silky smooth feel after my shower and it really moisturizes my skin.  The price for this in the stores is around $5.</li>
    <li> Skin is so soft, you can feel the moisture like the fresh dew from a morning mist.</li>
    <li> I used this at my cousins house and loved the smell of it and how clean I felt afterwards. I went home and ordered my own. I often won&#x27;t buy things like this unless I know how they smell or make me feel due to some products leaving a filmy feel behind.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. Ocassionaly I would get a few dry patches and this product eliminated that. In the winter my skin tends to get dry and once again, this product reduces the dryness. So far, this is the best body wash I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This is the favorite body wash of both myself and my husband. We like that it cleans well without drying out your skin. It goes on smooth and smells great, with a neutral scent that seems neither feminine nor masculine. We love that it has Shea Butter that moisturizes while you clean. Shea Butter is a plant-based emollient from the nuts of the Shea tree (Butyrospermum parkii) that mimics the lipid content of the skin making it easily absorbed by the skin thereby improving moisture retention. It is wonderful for dry and dehydrated skin leaving it feeling soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is not the first time I have used this product.  What I like about it is that it does not dry out your skin.  I have no complaints when it comes to leaving the skin moisturized and a nice scent also.</li>
    <li> Love this body soap.  Keep it like it is...its perfection in a bottle.</li>
    <li> I have used Olay for over 30 or more years.</li>
    <li> I moved recently to a place where it&#x27;s dryer, colder, and less humid. I searched for body washes and lotions that would help my dry skin, with no luck, until I found this beauty. This body wash literally eliminates the need for lotion, for me anyway. My skin is moisturized all day long, and it is noticeable within the first two uses.</li>
    <li> This is my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; body wash!&lt;br /&gt;It contains one jar of Olay moisturizer in each bottle of body wash, and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I step out of the shower, my skin feels so silky, smooth, and brand new. Even after I have dried off, it feels as though I have already applied lotion to my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is great - not overbearing, not too fruity, it&#x27;s actually a breath of fresh air compared to other scented washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After continued use, my overall skin condition improved dramatically. I no longer get rough winter skin, and never have to worry about dry skin period.&lt;br /&gt;I even ditched my lotion routine because I no longer need to spend the extra money on lotion that didn&#x27;t work half as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just give it a try and you will see the benefits of using Olay Body Wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, be careful when making your selection. I have tried other Olay washes that weren&#x27;t meant for moisturizing, and they actually dried my skin out. If the consistency is milky, then it is going to work great - if it is clear or colored, then probably not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> I got the original (not with Shea) and it works amazing!  I&#x27;ve tried every soap to help my skin even out from sun exposure,  dark marks, dark undereye circles,  redness, etc. Nothing worked until now. The Olay body wash &amp; bars are amazing!  A must buy!</li>
