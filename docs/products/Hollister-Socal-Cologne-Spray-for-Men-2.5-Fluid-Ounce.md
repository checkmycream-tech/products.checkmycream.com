    <li> My gilfreind&#x27;s favorite</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cologne!  It is the men&#x27;s scent but I am actually wearing it. lol  And the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.  Purchased the larger bottle for the same price as the smaller bottle in the store.</li>
    <li> My 17 year old son loves this cologne!!!!</li>
    <li> If you have never had a chance to smell this scent in store; I must say it&#x27;s an amazing summer smell. The best way to discribe it is a warm, coconut scent mixed with original scent old spice. It can be strong, and typically lasts 4-5 hours, so use moderately. This is NOT a knock-off, it&#x27;s the real deal. (this coming from a person who use to buy it in-store). The seller is a small vender and was very, very nice. After a mix up in the sending address, he offered to drive 45 minutes just to drop it off to me! I say that&#x27;s good service. The only thing I would say negitive about this is it is unboxed, but that really doesn&#x27;t effect much unless it&#x27;s a gift. Overall, I say this is a great price. It&#x27;ll save you at least 20$ if you were to buy in store.</li>
