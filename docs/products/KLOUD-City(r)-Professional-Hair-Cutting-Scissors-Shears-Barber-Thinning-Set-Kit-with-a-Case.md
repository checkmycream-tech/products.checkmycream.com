    <li> This set is nice, the first set I bought as a new barber student. The weight of these are a more heavier than most, but they aren&#x27;t TOO heavy. I enjoyed these shears for the first few weeks.. Then they became so dull I couldn&#x27;t do anything with them. But for the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much out of these. I haven&#x27;t used the thinning shears yet but they look sharp and nice. I would recommend these for a beginner student.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t receive all the things like the cleaning cloth.</li>
    <li> cheap don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recieve cleaning cloth !!</li>
    <li> better than worth of money. highly recommended to everyone.</li>
    <li> Exceptional tool. Its more than I expected in terms of craftsmanship and quality.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my Dad who is 80 and has taken to giving himself a haircut now. He loves them.  He said they were easy to hold and cut well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional hair stylist but really good for the price, I guess. I like they came with the case. Now I can cut my own hair and won&#x27;t have to go to the hair salon!</li>
    <li> Great scissors,  worth the price!</li>
    <li> Just as ordered. Do a great job!</li>
    <li> The thinning shears had hair and black grease on them. The scissors are fair and I use them with no issues. I am not happy with the items being dirty and the bag was sealed with packing tape. Just a bad experience. I will not buy lower priced items ever again. I tried to save some money and was let down.</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> For a wannabe cosmetologist these were a great first purchase. I have only had the chance to use them once, but they worked like a charm. I am very happy with this set, but keep in mind I have nothing to compare them to. I look forward to using them again soon. The price was right for this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great scissors. Have started cutting my own hair and these set comes in handy.</li>
    <li> Sent me a used item. There are scatches all over the scissors.</li>
