      <li>I&#x27;ve been using hand sanitizers since they came out, so I know a great deal about the product.</li>

      <li>Great price for the amount you get.</li>
      <li>I figure anything is better than nothing at all because I know they&#x27;re not washing their hands before eating their lunches!</li>
      <li>The bottle is very handy and easy to carry</li>
      <li>I even tried making my own product with aloe gel, glycerin and rubbing alcohol.  </li>

      <li>It shipped VERY fast!!!</li>
      <li>They now have a satisfied customer who will buy from Shoplet.com again and recommend them to others.</li>
      <li>I have three favorite sanitizers that kill the Norovirus and this is one.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what concerns me the most.</li>
      <li>This one kills more germs.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for a good sanitizer to keep norovirus away!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite hand sanitizer!</li>
      <li>After much review on what sanitizers kill norovirus, this one ranked at the top of the list.</li>
      <li>This is a good product and it does the job description however after reviewing the product ingredients and the actual size</li>
      <li>I was amazed how quickly I received the order.</li>
      <li>It actually has more alcohol than most hand sanitizers (71%), but it feels so much better than normal sanitizers.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor and dries fast.</li>
      <li>This is good because it&#x27;s not a gel, which has actually been found to help germs live.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, and leaves hands soft.</li>
      <li>You get much more bang-for-your-buck vs. traditional gel sanitizers, plus this one kills the stomach bug - the others do not.  </li>
      <li>MY HANDS FEEL SOFT AND CLEAN AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>It was their error and they corrected it quickly and professionally to the customers satisfaction.</li>
      <li>(although, it is too big to fit in your purse -</li>
      <li>And since it isn&#x27;t a gel, it evaporates much faster.</li>
      <li>so I received the second bottle with the pump for free.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t as much as sneeze.</li>
      <li>They charged me only for the original item</li>
      <li>Much better than the average hand sanitizer.</li>
      <li>If you do a quick read of the medical literature, you&#x27;ll find that most of the bugs we really to keep away (colds and flus) are not impacted by sanitizers with less than 70% alcohol content.  </li>
      <li>Contains light moisturizers so it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands.</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly</li>
      <li>I highly recommended this sanitizer for disease transmission prevention.  </li>
      <li>I work in the dental field and use this all day long in between patients for a quick sanitizing.  </li>
      <li>Drys quickly - My gloves go on easier than if I washed and had to wait for them to dry !</li>
      <li>Simple and evaporates fast.  </li>
      <li>I also washed my hands frequently.</li>
      <li>This product is one of the few with SUFFICIENT alcohol to kill what we likely want killed the most.  </li>

    <li> I ordered this item and it came on time, but was missing the pump. I contacted Shoplet.com and they immediately issued a replacement.  They charged me only for the original item so I received the second bottle with the pump for free. This is the definition of excellent Customer Service. It was their error and they corrected it quickly and professionally to the customers satisfaction. They now have a satisfied customer who will buy from Shoplet.com again and recommend them to others.</li>
    <li> We just love this product!!!!  I work in the dental field and use this all day long in between patients for a quick sanitizing.  Drys quickly - My gloves go on easier than if I washed and had to wait for them to dry ! No one in our office has had a problem w/ dry, cracking hands due to the moisturize in the product.</li>
    <li> Once you use this liquid mist hand sanitizer, you&#x27;ll never go back to goopy, gloppy gel sanitizers. And since it isn&#x27;t a gel, it evaporates much faster. Contains light moisturizers so it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands. This size contains hundreds of pumps. Everyone loves it at the office! It&#x27;s my new favorite hand sanitizer!</li>
    <li> If you do a quick read of the medical literature, you&#x27;ll find that most of the bugs we really to keep away (colds and flus) are not impacted by sanitizers with less than 70% alcohol content.  This product is one of the few with SUFFICIENT alcohol to kill what we likely want killed the most.  Killing bacteria that our bodies have already seen and aren&#x27;t affected by is useless.  Everything else is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  This is the best hand sanitizer I have found.  I was amazed how quickly I received the order.</li>
    <li> Hand sanitizer should come in one scent: unscented. . . There was antoerh one I bought on Amazon that actually read &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34;...and lo and behold on the ingredients...&amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;. Ugh.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and it does the job description however after reviewing the product ingredients and the actual size it is terribly over-priced.</li>
    <li> I was on the ship for 10 days and used this routinely entering and leaving my stateroom. I only heard of 2 passengers having Noro. I was not one. I didn&#x27;t as much as sneeze. I also washed my hands frequently.</li>
    <li> Use this at home instead of the hand gel sanitizers.  This one kills more germs.  We use it daily and refill the small travel size with this spray.</li>
    <li> You get much more bang-for-your-buck vs. traditional gel sanitizers, plus this one kills the stomach bug - the others do not.  Winner!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and delivery...thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Loooove this! Kills Norovirus. That&#x27;s what concerns me the most. Kids take to school in a smaller spray bottle. Great price for the amount you get. Just get a few travel spray bottles and put them everywhere!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using hand sanitizers since they came out, so I know a great deal about the product. I just used this Clorox one when I went to the doctor. It&#x27;s light, and leaves hands soft. I avoid ones with triclosan, so I was happy that this was made with alcohol. It actually has more alcohol than most hand sanitizers (71%), but it feels so much better than normal sanitizers. I even tried making my own product with aloe gel, glycerin and rubbing alcohol.  It turned out horribly and is gloppier than ones you buy.  This product is the best ever.  Two (sanitized) thumbs up!</li>
    <li> MY HANDS FEEL SOFT AND CLEAN AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT. I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> .great stuff I recommend it highly</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t help but feel that getting your hands on 71% ethyl alcohol and putting it in a spray bottle would probably have the same effect and be cheaper...but I don&#x27;t know where one would buy that.  This is good because it&#x27;s not a gel, which has actually been found to help germs live.  Simple and evaporates fast.  It shipped VERY fast!!!</li>
    <li> Bought for daughters 5th grade class to help fight all the bugs!</li>
    <li> This is the best hand sanitizer I have ever used.  Also supposed to be the only sanitizer to kill the norovirus.</li>
    <li> I have three favorite sanitizers that kill the Norovirus and this is one. I love it</li>
    <li> After much review on what sanitizers kill norovirus, this one ranked at the top of the list. It&#x27;s not sticky like gels (plus I&#x27;ve read that gels not only do not kill norovirus, but they can actually harbor it if you get the germs on your hands.), and it doesn&#x27;t smell at all once it dries. The bottle is very handy and easy to carry (although, it is too big to fit in your purse - I keep mine by the door, and just take it with me when I leave the house &amp; put it in a cup holder in the car.) I would definitely recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for a good sanitizer to keep norovirus away!</li>
    <li> I highly recommended this sanitizer for disease transmission prevention.  This is the most effective cleanser for preventing spread of cold/flu germs.</li>
    <li> I keep one of these in each car to kill pesky germs. Fits in the cup holder perfectly!  Doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor and dries fast.</li>
    <li> I send this in smaller spray bottles for my kids at school. It got great reviews for getting rid of germs during testing. Much better than the average hand sanitizer. I figure anything is better than nothing at all because I know they&#x27;re not washing their hands before eating their lunches!</li>
