<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very good perfume for long lasting, kind of relaxing aroma.</li>
    <li> I used this almost exclusively since I found it shopping Michigan Avenue in Chicago about 10 years ago and I still love it and use it daily.</li>
    <li> The scent is subtle and not overpowering. It&#x27;s very light. I would recommend this fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great value for money, smells really good too!</li>
    <li> Another winning men&#x27;s parfum.  To be enjoyed at any time.  Very pleased to have tried this scent.  Get it and enjoy.</li>
    <li> This is one EDP I never heard of.&lt;br /&gt;I happened across it in the Amazon store.&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews and thought I might give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Immediately it became one of my top 5 colognes ... phenomenal!&lt;br /&gt;This cologne can be worn in the office, on a date or any other social moment ...&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t a broadcast cologne, it is for up close and personal.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Packaging could have been a little more padded. But I was pleased.</li>
    <li> Have always been a fan of the Womens version of this fragrance. When I had a chance to smell the Mens I was blown away. It is semi soft, yet still manly. My husband loves this. He is VERY HARD TO PLEASE! To my surprise he has made this one his preference after sticking to one fragrance for forever. It mixes well with his body chemistry and is long lasting. The price  was amazing... I love deals. Shipping was great as well. Recieved it several days earlier than the ETA. All smiles over here!</li>
    <li> Product is excellent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the first time I buy this eau de parfum for my husband. He usually uses Bucheron. I wanted him to discover a new fragrance and read great reviews about Hanae Mori. It is really very nice and he liked it immediately. It&#x27;s definitely a success!</li>
    <li> My go-to daytime scent.  Always getting complimented.</li>
    <li> Try it before you buy it,I like it but not for everyone.</li>
    <li> This product is great and the value was outstanding. It&#x27;s not overpowering and the scent last all day&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> The perfume is really awesome and my wife loves the smell on me.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. A little bit goes a long way. I receive many complements.</li>
    <li> I ordered Eau De Toilette Spray because my manager is using it and when he passes by smells so good, I had to ask, then, I checked all the reviews and realize I got the toilette and not the eau de parfum, and now I believe I will have to re-order and get the right one (parfum) spending twice the amount I originally had planned..., My birthday is next week! I&#x27;m late to get it in time! what can I do????</li>
    <li> I am a cologne collector and have over 30+ bottles. Have everything from Creed to CKBe and this is my favorite in the collection next to St. Ives. Scent lasts a very long time and is a great summer scent. Very sweet smelling cologne.</li>
    <li> Gets the compliments.  Classy scent.  Different from everything else out there</li>
    <li> The product, price, and vendor are all 100% awesome. Will buy again from them!</li>
    <li> The chemical components were well mixed. The scent is wonderful and it stays on all day. The price was great compare to Macys.This product gets a four star because I don&#x27;t like to rate anything a five.</li>
    <li> Buy at a local retailer where you know it&#x27;s real</li>
    <li> After dabbling in the more expensive, top shelf colognes, I decided I like to keep some Hanae around. It is a good all around sweet scent that is not overpowering and the ladies like it, too.</li>
    <li> Great start and pretty good dry down, although a bit too floral in the finish for me. Still, I get lots of compliments from ladies on the scent so its not just about me! Great product and great price!</li>
    <li> the flower they make this stuff out of blooms at night so im told&lt;br /&gt;smell prettier than you are GET SOME</li>
    <li> Price and quality are exceptional and it&#x27;s always nice to hear the ladies tell you how good you smell!  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> THE LADIES MOVE THE SMELL.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years now.</li>
    <li> Good imitation not real</li>
    <li> Great smelling cologne, kind of on the fruity side but still manly enough. Works perfectly in the office and last pretty much the whole day on 1 to 2 spray.</li>
    <li> Smells great but the scent does not last all day. It was a good price for this size bottle. If you put some on in the morning, you will need to apply one more spray before dinner.</li>
    <li> I smell so good I want to lick myself. It&#x27;s a long lasting scent. Honestly 1 spray for 8 hours works for me.</li>
    <li> Nice ! It starts citric and turns sweet, its woody, chocolate and vanilla with that citric start. It´s superb combination of sensations. a pleasure tu use and very affordable price. Try it !</li>
    <li> I want my money back. Eau de Cologne is a diluted version of what I want and payed a premium for.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal! I compared it to the fragrance at high end stores and there is no difference! It arrived in 3 days...much sooner than they suggested.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is only me, the first day I put it on, I smelled the perfume. I was thinking to myself that is one that I will keep using forever. Then I stop smelling it, may be my nose was getting used to it. But I started getting compliment from my wife who said that she can&#x27;t wait to smell it when I am leaving to work and all day compliments from people at work. Great perfume.</li>
    <li> So far the best price I&#x27;ve found, especially for the parfum. Fast shipping by the way too.</li>
    <li> He loves it and I love it on him  : )</li>
    <li> Excellent service.  I will shop again.</li>

    <li> Best smell ever.  Buy 2 bottles, one for the home, and one for the car.  Scent, &amp;#34;last long time&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite EDP scents of all time with a phenomenal scent profile, exquisite dry-down and strong sillage. If you enjoy gourmands you will love its creamy base and subtle notes. I receive more compliments wearing Hanae Mori HM than others 10x its price. All in all it&#x27;s truly a better value than any other men&#x27;s EDP on the market and a very well-kept secret amongst fragrance connoisseurs.</li>
    <li> I Love the hanae Mori ofcourse I would recommend it to any body that love the sweet smells specially in the evening this has been the second time I have purchase it on these site of it wasn&#x27;t good I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it again its perfect for guys that don&#x27;t like the strong scent of a Cologn this makes the deference</li>
