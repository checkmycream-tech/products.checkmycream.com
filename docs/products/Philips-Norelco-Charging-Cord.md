<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This charger seems to work as well as the factory Norelco charger did. I had the factory cord charger for more than 20 years but misplaced it. When I looked on the internet for the Norelco charger I did not find the exact original Norelco brand one. I did find several vendors that sold Norelco products and replacements. The Norelco cord charger the vendors sold cost twice the amount of this one. This product is an excellent value for the money and the most important part is that it works. I would recommend this product and will buy from this seller again in the future.</li>
    <li> This charging cord was inexpensive and functions as it should.  No problems, so far.</li>
    <li> I found that it was not needed after all, I took my razor to a shop to find this out</li>
    <li> I lost my charging cord while travelling overseas.  This does exactly what I needed and cost much less.  Perfect match to the charge receptacle.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my purchase.  Also was very happy with the price.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a second cord with flexible charger for travel!!</li>
    <li> I can shave, and at a fraction of the Norelco replacement chord cost.</li>
    <li> Charge cord for my husbands razor was lost. On Amazon, we replaced it easily with exact right one for that razor. It was delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> Lost my charger and this one was identical to the last and works just as I would expect it to.</li>
    <li> Works as described. Exactly what you need when you lose the original.</li>
    <li> Uh, it charges my Norelco. Does it perfectly. What more are you looking for in a charger? The vertical nature of the plug is good for not blocking the other outlet(s) like some plugs tend to do.</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed to replace the missing power cord.</li>
    <li> worked for our Philips beard trimmer</li>
    <li> Happy to have a charger for my beard trimmer. Unhappy that I paid the aNd price for the charger that I did for the used trimmer. Bit networks now. Could&#x27;ve bought an all new trimmer.</li>
    <li> I received this product in a very timely manner! The product itself is the cheapest piece of junk I have seen straight from China. I can&#x27;t believe I payed $20.00 for this piece of crap. OK! It works, but for how long? I am a fool for giving this company my money!</li>
    <li> The good:    The power cord works.    The bad:    The power cord arrived in used condition (the amazon marketplace said nothing about this).  It was slightly dirty (white residue on it, washed off easily)  The price was a premium, esp. for a used product.  It took a long time for shipment and delivery.</li>
    <li> A little loose but does it&#x27;s job and charges the shaver. I got it in 3 days after placing my order. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Teen aged son lost the charge cord for his Phillips Norelco Speed-XL shaver, and I didn&#x27;t hear about it until the shaver was doa! Needed a replacement cord in a hurry.  This part worked as well as the original cord.</li>
    <li> Worked fine and great price</li>
    <li> Lost the first one, so I ordered a duplicate and it fits just like the original and charges great&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Works Well. I can shave now! Thanks 100% *****</li>
    <li> I think i lose my razor because the cable this save me, i dont want a lose my device cool really cool</li>
    <li> charges my razor as good as the original manufacture equipment i would like to see a car charger for my razor</li>
    <li> Does the job and charges fast.</li>
    <li> I had lost my old charging cord and could not charge my razor, this one was a great price, fast shipping, fit perfect and works great. I would recommend this charging cord</li>
    <li> Perfect!! So glad to have found this so I didn&#x27;t have to throw away my beard trimmer after the charger got lost!!</li>
    <li> Estupendo, la verdad se puede comprar como sustituto del original, tal como fue mi caso en el que perd&amp;iacute; el que vino originalmente porque me lo deje en un viaje que hice y tuve que adquirir este nuevo. Ha funcionado a la perfecci&amp;oacute;n y lleg&amp;oacute; justo a tiempo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Choice and very good quality.</li>
    <li> Not as described  It did not fit the unit despite what the description stated</li>
    <li> My boyfriend missed his charger, and this one just works as well as the original one.&lt;br /&gt;He hasn&#x27;t found any problem until now.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement to my original cord that was getting pretty warn. It fits well and charges but I wish the cord was coiled like the original cord.</li>
    <li> My original charger broke due to water damage.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered this one as a replacement on a Monday, and had it by Wednesday!&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great service! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Thanks this was better than having to buy the whole shaver.</li>
    <li> Charges my razor just like the old one that I lost.</li>
    <li> My husband now has a spare cord to use with his razor.  We forgot the cord when we vacationed so bought this one to use and it arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> It works great, and you can tell it is brand new. It gets the job done and thats all that really matters.</li>
    <li> Good product. Timely delivery.</li>
    <li> The item was sent as promised, it is a very good quality as I had expected. The item Pictured had a straight cord and the item shipped has the much shorter coiled cord which does not meet my needs    As it will cost me substantially more to return the item than it is worth, I simply will not purchase from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> As described.got this as a replacement to the on I lost. Surprised as it was Phillips brand OEM! Great price as well as compared to the generic versions.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t charge my older razor, pretty, but don&#x27;t work for me. check model list to see if yours is listed</li>
    <li> Purchased this cord for a Norelco Speed XL and prayed it really would fit and work.  It does and it was a relief not to have to buy a whole new razor.  Highly recommend this product and seller. Paid extra for expedited shipping and it came very quickly!</li>
    <li> My husband is pleased with this</li>
    <li> it fit&lt;br /&gt;it was the right one that fit my shaver and it came in a reasonable amount of time</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Have it for several months now and still fine.</li>
    <li> Does not work with my razor despite the model being listed.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly with my Norelco razor.</li>
    <li> works for me. alright shipping time</li>
    <li> I bought this cord for my uncle. He was ready to throw away his shaver because he&#x27;d priced a replacement charger and it was nearly as much as buying a new razor. Once he received this charger he was pleased with the performance and the charge on the shaver is excellent</li>
    <li> Amazon shouldn&#x27;t be selling this piece of &amp;#34;Chinese Junk&amp;#34; ---DON&amp;#34;T BUY IT--- IT FITS BUT IT DOESN&#x27;T CHARGE!!!!</li>
    <li> Ordered this charger as a replacement when I forgot to bring mine on a business trip, only to find out that it was dead on arrival. After leaving a review of my dissatisfaction with the bad product, a representative from PeaceShop offered to either send a new on or refund the purchase price. I was very surprised and delighted by the pro-activeness of their customer support which made amends for a bad experience despite the broken merchandise.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco Charging Cord is what I needed and it does the job. A good price for a replacement part.</li>
    <li> Did exactly what i needed it too!</li>
    <li> Does not work for my shaver even though it was listed as compatible.  The plug fits fine there is no issue with the build, the charger itself says it is a Philips charger but it did not work.  Not worth the time, money and effort to send back.  Recent reviews seem to be negative.  Do not trust this listing.  Hit or miss. Incorrect product description.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement charger cord for a Phillips Norelco model 495b.  This cord fits perfectly and is charging the razor right now!</li>
    <li> Didnt fit even though it said it would</li>
    <li> There really isn&#x27;t that much to say about a transformer (charging cord) except to state whether or not the thing works. This does.   It is a good item to have if you&#x27;ve lost the one that came with your shaver as I did, or your original is lost or damaged. I was happy to find a replacement on Amazon at the price I found it because I was in the habit of taking my shaver with me to work and shaving there and had somehow misplaced my charging cord. it is certainly possible to get a replacement from Phillips Norelco, but I found buying mine through an Amazon affiliate faster and less expensive.  Bottom Line:   My shaver works again: my beard is history.</li>
    <li> Was exactly as stated. My son is at college and &amp;#34;misplaced&amp;#34; his charger. Mom to the rescue.</li>
    <li> This unit works as advertised and my shaver is again charged.  The original charger failed. The construction is sturdy and the unit arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit. That says it all.</li>
    <li> Timely and as advertised. Included unexpected free gift.</li>
    <li> Was good service I have no complaints fast and was on time with what it said so I&#x27;m happy with everything thanks so much</li>
    <li> I lost my charger for my 7310xl, so I ordered this to replace it.  This got the job done as advertised.</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Good OEM charger for my phone.  Looks and works exactly like the one that came with the phone.  I wanted another so that I did not need to move my main one all the time so I have been able to compare them side by side.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t remember buying this.</li>
    <li> Charged my Phillips trimmer the first time I used it, now the trimmer doesn&#x27;t work at all. Won&#x27;t power on, won&#x27;t hold charge. Thanks a lot. Too bad the warranty on my trimmer is already over.</li>
    <li> Just what we needed! Thanks.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this cord in any nearby retail stores, so I mostly had to rely on the image of it through Amazon.com.  It was listed as a match for the model # we have, but another reviewer said not to trust that.  Well, I did, and it is a perfect match.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit my trimmer. I think its duplicate, may be chinese copy of Philips charging cord.</li>
    <li> I bought this knowing that I was taking a risk that it might not work with my charger. I bought a Philips Speed-XL razor from many years ago from Costco. It came with a charging stand which one of the connecting pins rusted and broke, therefore leading me to this purchase. I was very nervous about buying it but it works perfectly with my razor! just know that sometimes it may not work so figure out if your model matches up to what they say is compatible and hope for the best. It worked for me!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly as promised and works just fine.</li>
    <li> No longer looking all scruffy</li>
    <li> Wrong charger completely, says it works with the model of shaver i have, however does not fit the product. At least it was cheap, right?..</li>
    <li> Good replacement. Our son only had the new razor for a couple weeks and lost the cord or it walked away from his college dorm.</li>
    <li> It charges my razor, which is what I want it to do.  It does so without any problems.  If you need a charging cord for your razor (I often leave mine behind in hotel rooms), this should work fine for the specified model.</li>
    <li> Connector will not plug into the shaver;does NOT fit the shaver</li>
    <li> It came to my home just fine.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my nearly 10 year old Norelco.  Had left the old charger in a motel.  More compact than the old charger and comes with a nice strap to keep cord bundled.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t even fit my PHILLIPS NORELCO SHAVER. Phillips makes it physically impossible to find a charger in stores, and when they release one online, it doesn&#x27;t even fit. Just threw away $11 + shipping.</li>
    <li> I bought one because I lefft mine in a hotel room.... Yes I know, dummy right... It fits, works, and charges my razor perfectly as it should. Good price too.</li>
    <li> No complaints, the same as the OEM cord.  As long as I don&#x27;t lose this one I&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cord is rated 100-240V which will be nice for travel.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do. Nothing fancy.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend was upset with the length of my beard when we moved across the country and I left my charger in California.  This charger resulted in a charged beard trimmer, a trimmed beard, and an ecstatic girlfriend. The charger is simple to use, just plug one end into the wall and the other end into your shaving device.  No hassle!</li>
    <li> Very good for replace the Norelco old cord.</li>
    <li> Wish my razor worked as well as this did. Good price and solid work. Why pay ten bucks more for a name?</li>
    <li> Well this is a cord.  No problems with it.  It charges my razor and doesn&#x27;t fall out on it&#x27;s own..  Its a cord...</li>
    <li> Excellent. It worked as i wanted it to.</li>
    <li> I received it before the expected date.  It was exactly as described and is working perfectly!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for my shaver charger and a very detailed description if I may add</li>
    <li> Got one for me and one for my son.  worked on both of our models.  We lose things real easy.</li>
    <li> My husband accidently lift his plug in a hotel we stayed in, I thought we would have to buy a new razar but I went through  anazon and it saved us money and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> It was what I needed and what was advertised.</li>
    <li> Knowing how much cell phone chargers cost, I didn&#x27;t expect to find this for cheap, but it wasn&#x27;t a bad price. It&#x27;s amazing how easy it is to lose the cord and render a 150.00 razor useless. Glad this was here to save me from having to buy a new razor.</li>
    <li> I left my charger at a hotel and didn&#x27;t want to spend $60 for a new shaver just to get a charge so I ordered this and it saved me money and works perfect!</li>
    <li> Lost my charging cable after returning from vacation and was quickly growing a beard!  This worked with my Norelco model with no issues.</li>
    <li> Would not charge my Norelco 9160XL despite the description indicating that it would.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. It didn&#x27;t work with 1150X as it claimed. The charger you get is different from the picture. It says the output is 15v but you will get the Model HQ850 which the output is only 8v. I have bought many stuffs from Amazon and it is definitely one of the worst experience.</li>
    <li> OEM product. It charges my shaver...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working good , i really like it, if the cord can be self retrack, it would be perfect, shipping time was very good thanks</li>
    <li> It works perfectly.  Great description, fast shipping, wonderful price.  This is about as good as its going to get, unless you have the original.</li>
    <li> This is a  perfect replacement......I would order again.....I have no issues at all.  I have been using this for over 2 months...It works fine.</li>
    <li> works good - no issues</li>
    <li> This little beauty comes in at a whopping 24&amp;#34; length cord and is all black. There are even two little prong thingies that insert into a wall socket!! And now I can shave again!!</li>
    <li> Came new and as described.  Works perfectly and saved the day.  My husband left his old charger behind in a hotel.  All is well with the world now!</li>
    <li> My original charging cord broke after 3 years of use, so hopefully this one will last longer. 100% satisfied and does its job well.</li>
    <li> The cord was a replacement cord for my shaver. Its a great cord and works wonderful on several of my shavers!</li>
    <li> After a dead AC adapter rendered my shaver useless, I ordered a new AC adapter from Amazon.  I was a bit hesitant to order it on internet because there are several parts that look similar.  But they got the right part the first time and of course the price beat anything I could find locally.  My Arcitec shaver is working just fine now!    While it&#x27;s difficult to think of a lot of things to say about an AC adapter for a shaver, I hope this review will help others.  If you are like me and depend on user reviews, even for trivial stuff like this, then take a few moments and write something to let the rest of the world know about your experience -- thanks!</li>
    <li> I had to modify/cut out a portion of the input plug to the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;It works but had to modify it.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work with my model Norelco electric razor.</li>
    <li> While on vacation we needed a charging cord and we were able to get this shipped to our location.  It works great!  Actually easier then the stand that came with the razor!</li>
    <li> Great extra charging cord which can be used for both my older Norelco and new Norelco 1280. I leave it in my travel shaving bag so it&#x27;s handy when I&#x27;m on the road. It never hurts to have an extra, especially when the price is right, thank you Amazon...</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and was exactly what I expected it to be. Plugged it in and the Norelco razor started to charge. I would recommend this product and would buy from this manufacturer again if needed.</li>
    <li> replaced my uk power charger for my razor</li>
    <li> I would have like it to be a expandable, curled cord.  other then that what can one say?  Arrived rapidly</li>
    <li> great charger.  left original at home and need to charge razor.  great service.  can shave again.</li>
    <li> Great item just what I needed cause I had lost the one i had. The price is just right yes</li>
    <li> We needed a replacement for a lost power adapter.  This item arrived the next day after ordering it (wow) and has been working just fine.</li>
    <li> It works just like the original one, which accidentally got thrown away. Nice to not have to buy a new razor.</li>
    <li> This charger works well and does the job, without any hassle.  There is nothing more nothing less to say about this product.</li>
    <li> It works fine, just like the one that came with the shaver.  The delivery was prompt and I have no complaints.  I doubt this one to keep in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> I was unsure whether we would be able to replace the lost cord for my husband&#x27;s razor, so I went to Amazon. The cord works perfectly and we saved a bunch of money by not needing to replace the entire razor.</li>
    <li> The original cord was lost so now my husband will be able to shave everyday!&lt;br /&gt;Works great with his Norelco shaver. Smooth and fast transaction. Item as described in product description. Would do business with them again.</li>
    <li> Left my charger at a hotel and needed a new one.  I was not sure if this one would fit my model because it wasnt one listed; it fit great and charged just like the factory one.</li>
    <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cat but through my previous charging cable so I ordered this one. I definitely used the right model number but this still did not feet. It was close but not close enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> As I have stated above, I misplaced or lost my Philips Charging Cord. I am glad that I could replace it by purchasing it from you. It has satisfied my need. Thank you for making it available.</li>
    <li> I lost my original cord, and this fit perfectly. So I was very happy. This was the original replacement from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> This product was received defective.  I did not want to post a comment unit I was positive. I used electrical probes the kind use to check electrical voltage and verified the same test on another power cable to validate the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line these chargers do not prove power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope no one throughout their shavers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about three years and have had no problems, my shaver charges and operates exactly as it did with the original charger.</li>
    <li> This is the exact cable that works with my Norelco shaver.  Works great, if only my dog didn&#x27;t chew through the original one, I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy this replacement.  I was happy that this worked well.</li>
    <li> Product came, and all was good</li>
    <li> It took a month for the charging cord to arrive, but that is likely not the companies fault. I live in Korea and the government doesn&#x27;t like it when people purchase items from over seas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the charger, I just plugged it in and it seems to be working just fine. I gave it four stars since I am annoyed I had to wait so long.</li>
    <li> Is doing the job its supposed to be doing!!</li>
    <li> My (Axe) electric shaver is only a year old but this charger didn&#x27;t quite fit.  I had to take a knife and cut out some of the additional plastic hindering a full charging connection.  It connects just enough, if I were to bump it by accident the connection would be broken.  I&#x27;m not sure what the alternative is so I didn&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> We bought this after I accidentally tossed the previous charger for my husbands Norelco 9160XL. This one works great...it charges it. He loves that razor, says it holds a charge for about 3-4 weeks. Also, this charger is better than the one that came with it...while they both charge the same, the one that came with it was a little stand with a clock on it...just wasn&#x27;t a good size for how he/we like to store this in our bathroom so I like this one better as it suits our bathroom set up better.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and was as described.  So nice to find something like this so easily after my husband lost his charging cord.</li>
    <li> I liked it just fine, it fit my electric razor fine and charged it up ok.&lt;br /&gt; I would recommend anyone to by from Amazon.com</li>
    <li> Did not charge the shaver for the model it said it was supposed to. Plugged in different outlets, but no charge, wont even work when plugged in.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> To cut to the chase and tell you a honest review it didn&#x27;t work no matter what.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for my razor.  Misplaced the original</li>
    <li> Same as the original.  Works great!</li>
    <li> worked to charge my electric trimmer.</li>
    <li> Wife gave me one of the very very expensive Norelco razors.  Razor began charging past the normal 60 minutes, gradually adding a minute about every three months.  After less than two years, was up to 64 minutes, then suddenly lost its total charge and would not recharge.  Norelco support said in their experience, the charging cord had failed.  New cords from Norelco were quite expensive, but through this vendor were reasonable.  It fixed the problem.</li>
    <li> My first Norelco shaver, the charger died after about a year. So I bought a second shaver and was using the charger between the two of them.  A year later, the second charger dies. So now I had two perfectly good shavers and no charger.  On a whim I decided to search on Amazon and low and behold. I could just buy the charger!  And it works great!  Even if it only lasts another year, it&#x27;s still a lot cheaper than buying yet another shaver.</li>
    <li> X Long cord EZ plug Philips charger runs both my Norelco shavers different voltages great produced recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> When ordered, the cord of the charger was pictured as coiled.  This cord is a bother when transporting in the leather Norelco case.  However, there do not seem to be other options.  The charger does work.  I am disappointed that it is made in China, but isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get too excited about this - it showed up on time and it works.  Hasn&#x27;t tried to strangle anyone yet so it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> Although my shaver was listed as compatible (8240XL), the cord/charger did not fit my shaver. The cord/charger I received looks just like the picture except for the notch between the two contacts. The picture shows a wide curved notch between the two contacts. What I received has a very small rectangular notch. It will not fit on the shaver.</li>
    <li> How I once lost a cord.&lt;br /&gt;Now its been replaced with an OEM cord.&lt;br /&gt;Its made by Philips and ships in a bag.&lt;br /&gt;Happy again as it charges and powers my Razor.&lt;br /&gt;That is all that needs to be said.</li>
    <li> Does not work with the QT4070 as advertised.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for my dead charger.</li>
    <li> good replacement, too bad it cost so much</li>
    <li> Had to return it as it doesn&#x27;t actually fit the Norelco model I own even though the description clearly says it does.  Returned it successfully with no issues, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> I bought as a replacement for my husband&#x27;s very old razor. I was pleasantly surprised that it was the correct charger and he has a working razor again!</li>
    <li> Its works very well and i have again my powerful norelco shaver :). one of my cast bite the cable so i purchase his new one.</li>
    <li> The insulation on the original charging cord was flaking off and leaving bare wires, so I had to do something and gambled that this cord would work. As you probably know, if you&#x27;ve discarded the shaver&#x27;s original packaging, Philips Norelco does not make it easy to tell the model number or your shaver. The problem is compounded because the company makes so many models. My hunch is that if the end of the cable that plugs into your shaver has a notch between the two electrical ports, this cable will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give the cable three stars because the build quality isn&#x27;t great (it seems overpriced), but since it worked with my shaver, I bumped up the rating to four stars.</li>
    <li> I hate moving.  I especially hate moving across three state lines.  It seems I always lose something small, but important - like the charging cord for my Phillips Norelco 8151XL electric shaver.  After endless searching, I decided to see if a replacement could be had.  This charging cord was the first item to come up on my search.  At the price, I was happy because I didn&#x27;t have to replace the entire shaver to cover a lost power cord.  Side bar: I ended up buying another Phillips Norelco beard groomer because the cost of the entire kit was about $2 more than the cord.  Anyways, this cord is nice and long.  It plugs into both my electric shaver and the recharging base.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product and the price was appropriate.  Fit and finish are good.  Feels substantial - not cheap.  5 stars because I didn&#x27;t find any problems and it satisfies my needs.</li>
    <li> I like it, it produces 15v where the original provided 12v. This charger takes much less time to fully charge the shaver. I wish it had a coiled cord like the original but a twisty tie fixes that. All in all, glad I found a charger instead of having to buy a new shaver!</li>
    <li> I have received the charger and it works very well. I do not know what else to write, but this charger does what it is supposed to do.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have a Philips Norelco 9160XL Smart Touch, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year on the road now. I lost my charging cord at one of the hotels I was staying at and I didn&#x27;t have a way to shave. I looked up on amazon and saw that this might be compatable. I bought it without a second thought and it saved my rear end in business meetings and everything else. Definitely a good product.</li>
    <li> We lost the charger to my husbands electric shaver and luckily found this. Product arrived on time. So far we are pleased with product.</li>
    <li> It fit and it was what I was looking for. Instead of buying a new Norelco my boyfriend had laying one around without a cord, I just got this one and it was perfect. Back to business.Thanks!</li>
    <li> The good news is once you get this cord inserted into the razor it does work.  Charges the razor while in use or just sitting on the counter. The bad news....  it is an extremely tight fit getting it into the razor. I am not weak and I had to push as hard as I could to insert it. I thought I was going to break the razor.  It does seem to be getting easier with use. Most elderly folks I know would not have had the hand strength to get in first time. I checked more than a few times at first to see if it was going to insert, if it was the right cord.</li>
    <li> Charger was delivered as described. Very useful for my shaver.</li>
    <li> The charging cord was advertised as being compatible with the 8240XL.  The charger that was shipped was NOT the one pictured and did NOT fit the 8240XL.  The purchase was a total waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd one I ordered and it does not fit! The description of the model # was correct in the ad. I DID NOT FIT!</li>
    <li> is not charging just, loss my money</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement to a charger that was chewed up by the dog.</li>
    <li> Works well I and came in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I received this item approximately two weeks ago, so its use has been for a limited time.  However, it appears to be a genuine Philips charger, exactly like the one it replaced (I lost the original), and works as expected.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for the one our son lost!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Great price!</li>
    <li> On a recent trip I lost the charger for my 15 year old electric razor.  I was happy to get one through Amazon on time.  It works just fine.</li>
    <li> While it didn&#x27;t exactly fit in as deep in the charging slot as expected, it works fine - a little slower than the original, but still charges after a night.</li>
    <li> Its works and its good so not much more to say here!!</li>
    <li> A+ .  Product is as described</li>
    <li> The only drawback is that the cord will not stay in the Phillips brand charging base.  Not a big deal; when I need to use it I just make sure the cord is plugged in before I put the shaver in the cradle.  Overall, exactly what was advertised and what I needed.</li>
    <li> All of a sudden the charger cord was missing and the kids were heading off to college that week.  Amazon had the cord and delivered it quickly.  Does the job as well as the original.</li>
    <li> Great experience. Good service</li>
    <li> I use a Norelco electric shaver, however on one of my trips I lost my cable. After looking around in many shops without luck, I decided to order it from Amazon. Although a bit pricey, it does its job perfectly. Better this solution than having to buy a new good shaver.</li>
    <li> I own a Philips Norelco 8250X and this cable was incompatible, despite being listed as compatible and the connections fitting together. Beware ordering this charger</li>
    <li> This charger fit the intended shaver perfectly!</li>
    <li> Worst buy ever! Charging plug differs from the picture. Does not fit my 8894xl norelco shaver as advertised. Contacted amazon and amazon no response either. Buyers beware!</li>
    <li> I love my item. very fast delivery. Thanks ++++</li>
    <li> perfect arrived fast works perfect!! A1 Seller</li>
    <li> Defective, does not work, there is no output voltaje, bad purchase, I do not recommend to buy it, I am going to buy a generic one instead</li>
    <li> It works great it has a long straight cord and it has been good so far .</li>
    <li> I received this item more quickly than expected. It was in excellent condition and the price was very reasonable. It works well.  Thanks so much!!  I recommend this person highly!!</li>
    <li> On the road for several months, and left charger cord at home.  This saved me from buying a whole new razor,  and I am very happy with my present one</li>
    <li> I lost (forgot) my Philips Norelco Shaver charging cord in the cabin which was rented during our trip to the great smoky mountains. I came across this charging cord which said as OEM. Hesitantly ordered, and it was indeed 100% genuine Philips charging cord. There were other sellers who were selling the same at almost double price.&lt;br /&gt;It has been more than a month and this working fine.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the seller.</li>
    <li> it does the job it makes a a small buzzing noise when charging but its whatever it does what it needs to</li>
    <li> It did not work for my Norelco shaver. Tried multiple outlets and left it plugged in for a while...nothing happened.</li>
    <li> Would absolutely purchase again! Highly recommended. We are very happy with our purchase. The product is high quality and the customer service was as well. AAA+++ Thank you... We will be back for more!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work with my Norelco shaver. It wouldn&#x27;t charge it. Later, i found the original cord that i thought I had lost, and it works.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  So glad to find a replacement charger with a few clicks and get my husbands razor working again.</li>
    <li> After a couple of months, it&#x27;s working fine !</li>
    <li> My dad lost his charging cord so I gave him mine.  Ordered one of these and it works just like the original.  No cons.</li>
    <li> I received a charger, but it was not the one pictured.  Wouldn&#x27;t fit my norelco electric razor.  Looked more like: http://www.amazon.com/Shaver-Norelco-Braun-Remington-others/dp/B000FP7M9W/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_bt_5.</li>
    <li> This is the original Norelco cord, perfect replacement which I using for travel without having to disconnect my Jet Clean unit from the wall.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my razor, it&#x27;s listed in discription but, does not fit 7340XL</li>
    <li> It works just fine. I needed it as a replacement after losing my original cord. The Norelco one was more expensive.</li>
    <li> I have an HQ 7830 Philishave, which is one of the models claimed to be supported by this charger. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t charge (the shaver itself is fine - it still charges with the original charger I have for it). To add an insult to an injury, the seller does not offer a free return policy, which means that I have to pay for this return. But because it is a relatively inexpensive product, I won&#x27;t bother, and they know it. CROOKS.</li>
    <li> in the description it says it fits RQ1060 model but its not</li>
    <li> Recently I decided that I was sick of shaving with a blade and killing my face. Unfortunately, I could not find the power cord for my old Norelco. Purchased this guy and I was back in business. Now only if the old battery still could hold a charge....</li>
    <li> Looked high and low for the charging cord, so i was delighted to find the right one here.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I received my charger several weeks ago and have been using it regularly.  It is still working exactly as it should.  Seems to be a great replacement charger at a very reasonable price.  Looking at its construction, it seems that it is well put together and will outlast my Norelco razor if taken care of (as is the case with almost any item).  Overall, I would say this is a good product at a good price.  If you need a replacement charger, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> this one replaces the one that I lost. Works great.  Hope it lasts as long as the electric razor does.</li>
    <li> The cable work with my razor. It offered fast charging. Would recommend it to anyone with this type of razor.</li>
    <li> worked great and fit the razor  perfectly</li>
    <li> Cheap price and fast shipping - thx!</li>
    <li> Lost my charger and this one works.</li>
    <li> It is as z old one did it is ok</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit into the trimmer it says it is for.. After some altering, i managed to get it to work.</li>
    <li> It works that&#x27;s all that matters so it gets a five star</li>
    <li> Handy - just what I needed for my old razor.</li>
    <li> Fit the shaver just as the original cord.  Heck it might as well be the original cord!!!  Came well package and in a couple of days!</li>
    <li> If you plan on purchasing this shaver (Philips Norelco BG2028 Bodygroom)  you will need this when its charging cord fails...</li>
    <li> Very good! I used everyday</li>
    <li> Connector at razor fit better than the original.</li>
    <li> A little bit longer cord then the original, which is nice. A good replacement to have if lost or just in case.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect replacement.</li>
    <li> It is the right cord for my shaver. The shipping was timely and I have but high regards for the service,&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I accidentally threw away my cord, and was so upset! So glad to find a good replacement at a reasonable price . What else can I say? It&#x27;s a cord. It works. It arrived fast.</li>
    <li> Did not work with QT4070.  It fit, but I wasn&#x27;t able to get a charge.</li>
    <li> It definitely does its job so I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars for the functionality. It&#x27;s been a while since I used it until I rediscovered my shaver when I was moving but could not find the original charger that came with it so I bought this. It requires a hard push to plug it into the shaver and has no indicator light so I was skeptical at first, but my charger was fully charged afterwards so I guess it&#x27;s all good.</li>
    <li> Was a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be the correct cord after reading a bunch of negative reviews, but luckily it for perfectly and my trimmer is now charging! Looks like I don&#x27;t have to become a mountain man after all!</li>
    <li> Left the original charger in the Philippines and needed a new one, this one works great and is Identical to the one left in the Philippines.</li>
    <li> Worked great for my sons razor.</li>
    <li> This was as stated, and works great...</li>
    <li> Great across the board!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Amazon, buy here a lot. However, there is a serious problem with the many Norelco chargers sold here. I bought this charger because it clearly states it is for the 8140XL shaver. It does not provide the correct voltage and will not charge my shaver. The item&#x27;s side label says it puts out 8VDC at 100ma, but repsonders to questions said it puts out some other voltage/amps (15VDC/xxma). All the various chargers descriptions include dozens of Norelco models as being supported.  I doubt that is correct, and that does not agree with info from other websites.  And the questions/answers for all the various models seem to be intertwined, with a lot of variation and complaints about charger cord fit, charger output, etc.  I&#x27;m still searching for my correct charger.</li>
    <li> The charger is marked for Norelco, and I have a 8240XL.  The charger was listed for the 8240XL model 15V., and works perfectly. This is my case. I saw in a previous review that it didn&#x27;t work on the 8240XL, and I was worried but it did say it was for that model.  I took a chance, and it work.</li>
    <li> Sent quickly, it was what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This was the part I needed and came quickly at a great price.  Keep up the great work; I will use the service again and again!</li>
    <li> Fit and charged perfectly.</li>
    <li> Want a charger to charge some stuff?  well this charges only a shaver, but it does it well!  CHARGE AWAY!</li>
    <li> I have a Norelco 8240XL shaver which came with a charger type 8500X, output 15V DC 360mA, efficiency level IV.  This replacement charger is type HQ8505/D, output 15V DC, 5.4 W, max 800 mA, efficiency level V.  It fits and charges my 8240XL.  I haven&#x27;t timed it to see if it will charge my shaver faster than the original charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are labeled Input 100-240V AC 50/60Hz so they will work worldwide with the right plug-shape adapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click on the \\&quot;other sellers\\&quot; link to see that more than one seller offers this item \\&quot;fulfilled by Amazon,\\&quot; some with additional Prime shipping choices.  Mine came from \\&quot;BestDeals2013.\\&quot;  The reviews from all sellers are combined, so perhaps that accounts for some reviewers reporting that what they received fits their 8240XL and some not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco&#x27;s own parts website says the 8240X uses their 422203910972 charger, which is no longer sold and has been replaced by their part 272217190137, also known as this HQ8505/D.</li>
    <li> It was just what I needed. This saved me a lot of time and money I would have spent on a new one. It came in a timely manner and works just fine.</li>
    <li> After our condo burned down one of the many items that we now needed was a new charger for our electric shavers. This charger works great and was shipped in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I bought this after I foolishly forgot my charger at some hostel while traveling.  What&#x27;s great about this charger is that it&#x27;s universal with so many of the other Philips Norelco shavers.  In short, it does the trick and works like a charm.  Content with this product.</li>
    <li> works fine for a replacement cord...a little pricey for what it is...wish Philips would use a standard connector for all their product as i have a different cable for each device...drag.</li>
    <li> Item is slightly different than the one shown, non-the-less it is high quality and is stamped with the word \\&quot;philips\\&quot; on the end of the transformer. It is black in color and the cord is six feet in length. I am replacing the cord for a philips norelco 8140XL, and it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Who knows where the original went or what country it now resides in. I needed a new one and this one works great.</li>
    <li> item as described. functions as it should. no problems. recommended.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and works great</li>
    <li> My husband lost his charger, so we bought this as a replacement along with new shaver heads.&lt;br /&gt;Product is as expected and got here very fast.</li>
    <li> This worked perfectly.  My husband lost his cord a long time ago.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to get him a new one.</li>
    <li> I had looked in local stores for this item hoping to buy it locally, but no one carried this exact cord.  Was thrilled to find it online at a reasonable price.  It arrived faster than was quoted.  Thanks for the great service!</li>
    <li> Does quite well as a replacement for my Philips Norelco razor and had not failed me yet. Very long cord to allow you to shave while its plugged in.</li>
    <li> I purchased this charger as I had lost the one that came with my razor.  I own a Philips Norelco 8240XL and this cable was incompatible, despite being listed as compatible and the connections fitting together.  Beware ordering this charger as it may not actually work with your razor or every razor listed.</li>
    <li> Good replacement for my original charger.</li>
    <li> Well, what can I say. I checked the instructions before buying the item, I even Google the original instructions for the shaver... verified that this would fit the make and model. Buy it... got it and... Did not fit. Not even close.</li>
    <li> Dos the job, just like the original that I lost...</li>
    <li> Shipment was on time.  Excellent product.  In met my need.  Therefore, I do not have to buy a new razor.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Shipped very fast. Good value. A+++++</li>
    <li> This cord was exactly like the original cord.  I lost the original cord during a move and ordered this as a replacement.  It was exactly like my old cord except brand new.  Perfect fit, perfect condition.  Should last longer than the electric shaver it charges.  Packed great, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I lost my charger to my razor a while ago, and this worked exactly like I wanted it to. Charges the razor fast too.</li>
    <li> This product works great! Just what I was expecting. I lost my charger and this is a great replacement at a great price. Thanks!</li>
    <li> One end plugs in to the wall, and the other end plugs in to my electric razor and charges it. Technology is getting more and more amazing all the time! What will they think of next? I&#x27;m sooooooo glad we didn&#x27;t listen to Tesla and get free energy out of thin air, I would much rather pay an electric bill each month - Oh, and the shipping was super fast.</li>
    <li> The cat chewed up my old one, and this is its replacement. It works great, and keeps my Norelco beard trimmer charged up. It&#x27;s at least as good as the old one!</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly, Works as expected. Other than the fact that the adapter and razor tend to get a little warm while charging (something I hadn&#x27;t noticed with the original charger that I misplaced), I have had no issues with the product over the last few months. Does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I lost this charger while traveling. I was glad to see this available. I did not want to buy another shaver.</li>
    <li> This is exactly like the original cord that came with my Philips Norelco Arcitec.</li>
    <li> Had looked all over town for this cord.  Should have looked online first.  Reasonable price, was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I misplaced the original charger to my Norelco Shaver; ordered this replacement and it works like a charm. Thanks to Amamzon for having these great items.</li>
    <li> Lost my old one and found this here on Amazon. Works great! No complaints.</li>
    <li> Definitely NOT made for my fiance&#x27;s razor. Said it was compatible but it would not charge. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Arrived when it was scheduled and works as well as the original. No problems with this.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware. Item that came does not look like example and does NOT WORK. I have a sensotouch 3D folding stand. Cord did not fit properly and did not work no matter how many times I plugged it and replugged it in.</li>
    <li> if you lost your electric shaver cord. this one works great.</li>
    <li> good deal, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> fit perfectly and charges my razor very quickly and efficiatly. i would highly recommend this to anyone that needs a replacement or new charger</li>
    <li> This is the perfect replacement cord for the Norelco my husband has.  Finding a replacement was confusing because of the product descriptions but we received the correct one.</li>
    <li> Wrong cord!!!Doesn&#x27;t work!!!</li>
    <li> It didnt work for the first 3 days, once it started to work , its great!</li>
    <li> perfect match for my razor and prompt delivery...</li>
    <li> The cord serves its purpose and I was happy to find it on  Amazon. And, especially pleased with the price.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, enough said.</li>
    <li> Good product with great delivery.</li>
    <li> The product works perfectly for in-house AC to DC charging of my Magellan RoadMate GPS. Great value. Works exactly as stated.</li>
    <li> just a charger that works. the part the plugs into the wall is bigger and clunkier than it needs to be, and what with no shave november i haven&#x27;t charged in a while, but it has been working great as a replacement over the last few months.</li>
    <li> I lost my previous charger cord and needed a new one. Was a bit confused at first because Philips Norelco AT810/41 was not listed. Anyways, guess I lucked out. It&#x27;s been 2 weeks since I ordered it and it have been working like a charm. Plus I bought this through Amazon so if things goes wrong Amazon will always come through!</li>
    <li> Why don&#x27;t they ship the cord with the stand instead of two weeks later, waited two extra weeks too shave.</li>
    <li> The perfect replacement for a lost norelco cord.</li>
    <li> Great Charger replacement</li>
    <li> Please check on the head, this does not fit regular trimmer. Returned it.</li>
    <li> I came a cross this item and bought it as a trial.  After I received and used it, this item works like a champ.  Great price too.</li>
    <li> The photo shown is an 8500XL charger, and the one that this company ships out is a HQ8505/D. Probably does not make a difference for most of us, but the Amazon Ad should be updated to show the correct photo and model number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like it when vendors make product subsitutions without notice.</li>
    <li> I bought this cord to replace the one I lost.  I plugged in the cord and my shaver was charged in about an hour.  It seems to work well.</li>
    <li> well its a charger that works dont really know what to say. I will say the cord is pretty long and i like that. Overall good charger.</li>
    <li> We have 2 Phillips Norelco Razors that we lost the cords to when we moved. I kept thinking they would turn up when we opened the next box but, it just never happened, so I purchased this one as a replacement. It fit BOTH of the Razors and yes,&lt;br /&gt;we have to take turns charging them but, lord it was a lifesaver at a price we can afford!</li>
    <li> Though it&#x27;s not exactly the same as the part it&#x27;s replacing it fits my electric shaver, as advertised.  I&#x27;m pleased with my purchased.</li>
    <li> It says it should work for my razer but it doesn&#x27;t charge at all. Hopefully going to be able to return it but what an inconvenience &amp; disappointment.</li>
    <li> The charger works as promised.</li>
    <li> I ordered the wrong one</li>
    <li> got here in time, did it&#x27;s job. Good stuff</li>
    <li> just what i was looking for</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly for the Philipps Norelco 9160 smart touch XL</li>
    <li> This product works just as it said it would. My bf lost his power card I replaced it he&#x27;s so happy to be able to use the trimmer again. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Worked flawlessly in my Norelco electric razor!  Even came in the OEM packaging!  I will recommend your product whenever someone has a problem!</li>
    <li> It works, not much else to say, nor ask for.</li>
    <li> I had lost my cord and found that my model was no longer available - was very happy to see that I could simply replace the charging cord instead of buying a whole unit!</li>
    <li> Lost the original cord and was a bit skeptical that I could find a \\&quot;real\\&quot; replacement.  This is it and works as good as the original.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t compatible with my Philips ended up wasting money return shipping is as costly as the charger so didn&#x27;t bother to return. Do not haste first see if its compatible other wise it will be waste like mine</li>
    <li> Does charge with a charging stand. Worth the money. Cord can be a little longer but does the job worth the money.</li>
    <li> I almost replaced my sons shaver (expensive) when I just happened to check Amazon and find the charger he had lost. Arrived promptly, works perfectly! Saved lot&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Make sure you have the correct part number and make sure you get the correct part number.  I was not that lucky</li>
    <li> You can never have enough shaver cords if you travel. It seems authentic and decent quality.  Wish it was a little cheaper but otherwise I don&#x27;t see any problems.</li>
    <li> This product does not fit Norelco 7110X as listed above. There are two small notches on the razor that are not matched on the charging cord.</li>
    <li> Matches the cord that came with the razor.  Pricey but does the job.  I&#x27;d buy again rather than pay twice the cost to buy a new Norelco.</li>
    <li> does not fit my shaver, just threw it away</li>
    <li> There is not much to say about the power cord except for the fact that it works as advertised. Good item.</li>
    <li> The cord was delivered very fast! Service was great! Product is good! 5 stars from me!</li>
    <li> Does what it needs to do.</li>
    <li> The charger was delivered quick, and it performed great.  For a replacement, it was an actual Philips device not a generic one.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased to be able to find this item here.  I give it 5 stars and a Cat&#x27;s Meow!</li>
    <li> Exact match for the original charger that came with my Norelco shaver to replace the one I lost while on travel.</li>
    <li> Exactly like the original that came with my Phillips Norelco. Works well after over 12 months- no issues or problems.</li>
    <li> The Charger arrive a head of time which always seems to happen whenever I order from Amazon, they are great to deal  with. The item was just as described and works perfectly. I highly recommend dealing with the folks.&lt;br /&gt;George Madden</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well worked for a little while then stopped charging</li>
    <li> ive had my norelco spectra 8894xl bond edition since it came out over a decade ago.  it still works great, just needed a new charger since i lost my original one when i moved. awesome replacement.</li>
    <li> Nothing to add. It is almost exactly the same as the one that came with my norelco trimmer. This is a slightly different model (it lacks, for example, a led light telling if the battery is charging - not something that I miss).</li>
    <li> Not sure what the say except that it works as intended. It charges my shaver and that is what i bought it for ;)</li>
    <li> This charging cord works as expected and arrived quickly. I would recommend this product because it works; what else is there to say.</li>
    <li> Lost charger in a move. found this one that would work with my model 1150x shaver. got it fast and its exactly like the one that came with my shaver.</li>
    <li> Perfect and got here quick !! works every time i use it and seems to be of high quality as well.</li>
    <li> I needed this for some of my electronic devices. It works perfectly and would buy another if needed with no hesitation.</li>
    <li> Hadn&#x27;t been able to use my shaver in too long. I had almost forgotten about it. Then I suddenly remembered I had one and bought the charger for it. And it works!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a charging cord for my shaver. I&#x27;m glad to have it so I can shave again, but in the end it&#x27;s just a cord.</li>
    <li> Was shipped quickly and was the right fit for the razor I had. In the item description it was very helpful to me knowing I was ordering the right cord.</li>
    <li> Everything was great! I have nothing bad to say about the services. Your explanation of the product was on the dot, thank you for your timing as we&#x27;ll. keep up the great job!</li>
    <li> My wife lost the charging cord in a move over a year ago. I have just dealt with the fact that I would be using my manual razor for life. Have no idea why I waited so long to check if Amazon had a replacement... but they did and this works perfectly! Alas, my Norelco and I unite again!</li>
    <li> It works good with my 1150x.&lt;br /&gt;Looks just like the original one, which I lost during moving.&lt;br /&gt;No cons so far.</li>
    <li> item is cheap did not work plug ends are thin and have no holes had to squeeze ends to make contact with outlet then it work it looks bootleg for 12.74 thought  I was getting the orignal thing.I hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> Purchased a Norelco Power Touch AT880 and lost the power cord. Your operators were great in their search but couldn&#x27;t find a cord to match. He even contacted Norelco for me and they were unable to sell me a replacement cord.&lt;br /&gt;So I searched the cords and found one who&#x27;s picture matched and THIS works fine. It saved me from having to purchase a new Shaver before my husband before he discovered I lost his cord. :)&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to be an avid fan.&lt;br /&gt;PS&lt;br /&gt;It even arrived much sooner than was promised.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.  I didn&#x27;t realize it was going to be a Phillips brand, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> Is good charging cord</li>
    <li> I bought this, not because my old charger was broken, but because it is more compact, and easier to pack for travel.&lt;br /&gt;It did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;The body is smaller than the original, and the cord coils up more compactly than the original curly cord.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves his new charger, and says it is way better than his old charger he had (before I lost it). LOL!</li>
    <li> Dont ever remember using this chord. Maybe it was awesome, doubt it though</li>
    <li> Perfect. Exactly what I needed. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> needed a replacement charger for my noreco shaver.&lt;br /&gt;works great! i like the fact that it&#x27;s orentrationc on how it plugs&lt;br /&gt;into the wall socket is different than my old one.</li>
    <li> This cord was an exact replacement for my lost cord. Great buy.</li>
    <li> The replacement charging  cord  was just as good  as the original cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recomend it to the public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good purchase.</li>
    <li> Just a replacement adapter for my razor --- It works great and I have not had any problems with it</li>
    <li> Without a new cord, my husband was unable to use his beloved electric shaver.  With a new cord, we&#x27;re back in business!</li>
    <li> This charger does not work on all razors listed... I just wasted 20 bucks</li>
    <li> Does not come with the charging stand required. Wish description would say this</li>
    <li> This charger does its job as intended.  Works with my razor as the description said it would.  My only gripe is that it is larger that the original charger I had for my razor.  Other than that no worries here.</li>
    <li> Works as OEM. Maybe it is OEM. Perfect !!</li>
    <li> I am pretty certain that I threw away the cord for my Norelco QT4070 when we moved into our new house. I was a little bit leery of getting this, but at the price I figured it was better than buying a new trimmer for my winter beard. I&#x27;m glad that I did. The plug fit correctly and charged the trimmer just as well as the one that came in the package.</li>
    <li> Arrived timely, worked fine. 16 more words required. Arrived timely, worked fine. 16 more words required. Arrived timely, worked fine. 16 more words required.</li>
    <li> It did not work. It came in a sandwich-sized ziploc so I don&#x27;t know if it was new. I bought this because the charging cord I bought earlier from Voulez Vous, also through amazon, did not work. The charger from Voulez Vous also came in a sandwich-sized ziploc that was wrinkled and appears to have been recycled.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do. Glad I found this option instead of having to buy an entire new shaver when my original cord was somehow misplaced or lost.</li>
    <li> The new charger is better then the origanal</li>
    <li> This product is all I could ask for , it works great and is compact enough that I can pack it in my over night bag easily!!!</li>
    <li> THis was just perfect and great. I had hoped it would fit my Norelco and it DID!!!! YEAH@ will recommed to anyone and everyone</li>
    <li> It works good, but not as the original. the original has a small light flashing when charging.</li>
    <li> Product delivered not as advertised.  Not only did it not work for my 7310XL, the unit delivered is different from the photo.  Tried to trim the male side of the plug….this worked but the unit still was defective.  Now I cannot return it and I still can&#x27;t charge my razor.  Amazon… you got one by me.  Consider my $10 a donation to your business… could you at least send me a tax statement so I can write off the loss?</li>
    <li> I was on an extended business trip and found my razor was discharging too quickly to be able to make it home before the charge was to 0%. Possibly needs new blades. No one was home to send me my charger so I ordered a new one to just leave in my suitcase. They shipped it to me at my hotel and it arrived on Saturday. Life is good again. It appears to be original equipment from what I can tell. Worked just as I had envisioned. A great trick when someone is out of town, it is easier on many things like this just to get one to carry along with you.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Norelco PT724. I was very impressed with the speed of delivery, it was here in a couple of days! I plugged in my razor and it charged it up quickly. Looks like the original charger as far as I can tell. I would definitively recommend ordering this charger.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered before the due date and works great.</li>
    <li> good replacement for my shaver works fine</li>
    <li> Left our charger in Canada, and the shipping back to us was way to expensive, so we bought this little charger.  It fit and works perfectly!  Great product...highly recommend!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have no idea what I did with original cord but this one takes the spot with no argument.</li>
    <li> It worked; replaced lost cord to norelco shaver.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed!!  Thank god I found this cord.</li>
    <li> The charger works awesome. It was fast shipping. Very happy!</li>
    <li> Instead of replacing my norelco with a brand new shaver after I left the cord in a hotel the investment of replacing the.cord made it more sense and completely worthwhile.</li>
    <li> When charging the shaver, the charges makes high pitch hissing noise. I actually had to leave the charger in another room, so I am not disturbed by the noise. But it does the job and I am finally able to shave again.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find a compatible cord replacement for my son&#x27;s razor.  It works great, allowing him continuous use of a razor he loves.</li>
    <li> I had lost my charger so I had to buy another one. Thought this was a good buy and I ordered it. I have had it for 2 weeks now and no problems whats so ever. The product works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this item to replace because I loaned someone my charger and they never returned it. Let this be a lesson to you to never loan your charger to a so-called &amp;#34;friend&amp;#34; because you will never get it back. However, if you do get taken advantage of - like I did - or you just happen to damage your then this is a great replacement.</li>
    <li> I bought my razor in europe but I live in America. I needed an adapter so I could charge it at home. Two years later this is still working well.</li>
    <li> My BF lost his charger, so we bought this one. It suits the Philips shaver.It is really good. Looks very new, and not expensive.</li>
    <li> Good Product. Worked fine for what I needed it to be. Replaced my lost charge cord just fine. Thanks again</li>
    <li> This charger works great for my Norelco. It is convenient and easy to use, the same as the original that the Norelco came with.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Charging light flashes on razor no matter the charge level. It is suppose to flash when charge is complete.</li>
    <li> Works well and fully charges my razor fully.&lt;br /&gt;As good as the original charger.&lt;br /&gt;Everything that I expect from a replacement charger.</li>
    <li> I DID NOT GET A GOOD CHARGER.KINDLY HELP ME IN RESOLVING MY ISSUE.</li>
    <li> What can I say? Is a good article and does what it is expected of a replacement item to replace the lost one.</li>
    <li> This charger does exactly what it in intended to do; charges my trimmer. It was cheaper here than anywhere else I found it online as well.</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor ordered after my original went up. My face is clean shaven once again.</li>
    <li> Great charger for my beard trimmer. Just like new!</li>
    <li> The product I received was not the same shape plug as the one pictured, and does NOT fit the QT4050 as advertised.  If you&#x27;re looking for a replacement QT4050 charger, this is not it!</li>
    <li> Even though noted in the description, this cord does not fit the Philips HQ9070 model. I had to buy this one which fitted nicely. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H79QACO/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> perfect, actually did not feel like a 5 cent item as some of the other aftermarket adapters I have bought.</li>
    <li> My son lost the original power cord to his shaver, so I ended up looking for a replacement on-line.  This fit the shaver exactly and has worked perfectly from the beginning - it&#x27;s been two months now with no issues.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, everything as expected.</li>
    <li> I lost my charging cord in San Fran when I was visiting a friend, and I&#x27;ve been stealing my friend&#x27;s cord now and then to attempt to charge my razor, which has been really annoying. Pointless stories aside, if you&#x27;ve a newer model that has that strange little notch that kinda cuts into the figure 8 hole (really great with descriptions, here), it fits perfectly. I personally have a 8250XL, if anyone wanted to know. Happy shaving!</li>
    <li> Worked well as replacement for lost original cod for Artec.</li>
    <li> It works. Nothing caught on fire while I was using it. 5 stars for that.</li>
    <li> nice that can get these as I&#x27;ve had my shaver for years</li>
    <li> work perfectly, just like original</li>
    <li> Just what he needed ! My husband lost his cord somehow and this allows him to continue to use his Norelco!</li>
    <li> The ítem was well documentes as to the model of the eléctric shaver. It imposible to erred in the model.</li>
    <li> I lost my original charging cord and my shaver sat dead.  Thanks for bring it back online. I will need new blades soon.</li>
    <li> Very accurate charging mechanism. It makes for the electricity to be ok. Maybe include instructions on how to control the energy derived from the home power ports into productive processes besides just shaving. This energy could be used for the good of the world such as infusing the electricity into our children to have superpowers like shaving people through the use of their minds!</li>
    <li> It was purchased for a friend.  I&#x27;ve not heard anything negative, so I must assume that it was exactly what was needed.</li>
    <li> BEWARE! This charger does NOT work for all the chargers listed. boggles my mind why this company would list incompatible charger model numbers. It is NOT compatible with the QT4000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This charger is not compatible with all the model numbers listed. It boggles my mind why this company would falsely advertise incompatible model numbers. It is NOt compatible with the QT400.</li>
    <li> I lost my charger for my top of the line Norelco. I needed this charger unit. Very inexpensive. Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Numerous tries to get complete system failed to get results.  This item is useless to me without the cradle.  I sent pictures of what was needed several times to no avail.  Unacceptable.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Lost the last one when I moved; this was the exact replacement.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a charger, what else do you want?</li>
    <li> It looks like the original charger that came with my shaver. Works great as expected.</li>
    <li> said it worked for mine and it didn&#x27;t so I returned it.</li>
    <li> Not a factory product but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Came quick and as expected</li>
    <li> We lost the original charging cord that came with the Norelco razor and found this one to replace it. It works great!!!</li>
    <li> fantastic replacement power cord</li>
    <li> Solid little charger that is sleek and light, rather than bulky like some.  It fits my Philips/Norelco 7310XL electric shaver like a glove!</li>
    <li> Great fit and works well.</li>
    <li> Lost my Norelco cord on a trip.  This is a good replacement that works very well.  Well worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I thought my razor died but it turned out the cord wasn&#x27;t working. Can&#x27;t find charging cords in normal stores, found this universal charger and it works and is very cheap.</li>
