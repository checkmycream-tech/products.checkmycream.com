    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I have auburn hair so it helps darken my eyebrows a bit and brightens my face.  The gel also keeps eyebrows in place. I wish it was available at stores...I live in Chicago and can only find it online.  Wish it was more available.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this item in any local store -- spotted it on Amazon.  The service was very quick.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this product on line! GREAT, always looking for it since you can&#x27;t find it anymore in the stores. Maybelline - please, return it on shelves of our stores!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have curly eyebrows and this product tames them into submission. They look the way they should look. I don&#x27;t know why maybelline stopped making this product. I also like the clear, but I couldn&#x27;t get it even with ordering the discontinued items. Can you tell me why Maybelline would discontinue excellent items I have used for years?</li>
    <li> I have looked everywhere for this product for years.  Don&#x27;t know why Maybelline discontinued it, but I am so glad to find it again.  It is better than any brow pencil I have ever used.  Simple, quick, and natural looking.  Fabulous!!![[ASIN:B001TOUB7I Maybelline Brow Styling Gel - TAUPE]]</li>
    <li> I used to use this many years ago and got my girlfriends onto it back then. For some reason or other, I stopped using it (probably because I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore) and forgot about it. A few months back, one of my girlfriends asked me if I had seen this product anywhere because she loved it and couldn&#x27;t find it anymore. I made it my mission to find it, and sure enough...amazon came through. I ordered it and love it more than ever.  I have gaps after the points in my brows and this gel makes my brows look absolutely perfect.  It is so discreet, unlike pencils, looks very natural.  Also keeps the brows in place. I have gotten many compliments about my brows because of this product...bring it back Maybelline!</li>
    <li> I just love this product. It really looks nice on and is very natural looking. Gives the brow a nice color and style.</li>
    <li> I had used Maybelline Brow Styling Gel for several years and suddenly could not find it anywhere. I was thrilled to finally find two that were available at a fair price. They were in the original packaging and mailed to my home quickly. Wish Maybelline would reconsider marketing this product. It is so much better than the typical eyebrow pencil because it doesn&#x27;t leave an unreal marked line. Thank you for making this product available for a little while longer.</li>
    <li> Love the convenience and color of this eyebrow gel.  I&#x27;m quite fair and this worked well on my brows; no red in it.</li>
    <li> Maybelline Brow Styling Gel(Taupe)is the best brow product I&#x27;ve found.  It&#x27;s basically mascara for brows and it looks natural and stays put!  I&#x27;ve tried everything else and so far this product is the best.  Too bad it&#x27;s discontinued!  Brow pencils of all kinds just look fake no matter how well applied.  COME BACK brow styling gel!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is much better than pencil or powders for the brows. It goes on easier, and looks more natural.  I can&#x27;t believe they discontinued it.</li>
    <li> I had been using eyebrow gel for several years to fill in my slowly disappearing eyebrows. Suddenly I couldn&#x27;t find the product on the store shelves any longer.  I searched the internet and found I could purchase it online. What a relief! The other types of eyebrow pencils didn&#x27;t work for me. I love Maybelline Brow Styling Gel and I will order it as long as it is available. Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> I use maybelline products a lot and this item was very disappointing.  It was very dry and did not perform as well as another eyebrow gel I have been using</li>

    <li> Wonderful product!  Why in the world are they getting rid of this great product?  I&#x27;ve been using it for years with many changes of hair color--the taupe goes with them all.</li>
    <li> Very dry!!!  Tried putting some water on brush, which helps alittle.  I believe the product is old.  Will not order again.</li>
    <li> Just the right amount of color to cover up some grays along with a touch of control.</li>
    <li> This product is great when it is brand new.  It turns within a few weeks, turning watery.  You have to throw it out.  Vendor was good however, product arrived on time and sealed in a new package.</li>
    <li> This product was everything it claimed - and just the perfect color for me!  Goes on easily, and stays put all day. I will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> wish you had more of this ,i love it and hate to do without it,can you get more of it in.</li>
