      <li>here&#x27;s my review of GFT&#x27;s Rose shaving cream&lt;</li>
      <li>Wow...smells nice but a bit feminine.(so it might put off some of you)</li>
      <li>Lathers up nice.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended - one of Trumper&#x27;s best products.</li>
      <li>This, by far, is the best for me.</li>
      <li>The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming, so if you&#x27;re put off by smelling like a rose... don&#x27;t worry.</li>
      <li>But I think it is by far the best.</li>
      <li>But, it lathers up really well, smells good, and makes for an exceptional shave.</li>
      <li>Wjips up a great lather for a smooth shave, i was worried about the rose scent, but it actually is very pleasent.</li>
      <li>VERY happy with this product and intend to make it my regular shaving soap from now on.</li>
      <li>I love this shaving cream.  </li>
      <li>can say that I love it</li>
      <li>I love the cream.</li>
      <li>This has been my favorite shaving cream since I got it as a gift when I was 13.  </li>
      <li>(Ok i know ..</li>
      <li>I shave with a straight razor, and it gave me great lubercation, and no razor burn.</li>
      <li>gives me a better shave than my Mach 5 overpriced &amp;#34;toy&amp;#34; razor.</li>
      <li>The smell, lathering, and moisture is top notch.</li>
      <li>I love this shaving cream.</li>
      <li>The girlfriend loves it, but I think avocado is still her favorite cream of mine.</li>
      <li>Trumpers really produces a great product--</li>
      <li>I like the more citrus scents.  </li>
      <li>thats ok,</li>
      <li>Very rich lather.</li>
      <li>This is not the original Geo F Trumper Rose.</li>
      <li>wonderful shaving product and the scent is subtle but very nice</li>
      <li>The rose scent is very light, floral, fresh, but for me it is just not quite my style.</li>
      <li>Violet is my favorite overall, and Extract of Limes is very good, too.</li>
      <li>I have enjoyed the Rose very much.</li>
      <li>Scent is &amp;#34;rosy&amp;#34; without being too strong and it is great on my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>The scent on this is very very light and a clean one at that.</li>
      <li>Lathers up easily with a rich foam, very smooth and creamy on the skin.  </li>
      <li>The great smooth, slick, voluminous lather, cushions and protects and provides the finest shaving I&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
      <li>Rose scent is okay, not too overpowering, but I like the Violet cream better because it has more of a soap scent mixed in.</li>
      <li>The rose smell is very feminine, as well.  </li>
      <li>Follow up with the Coral Skin Food, another fantastic Geo.</li>
      <li>The Coral Skin Food is fantastic, though.</li>
      <li>This product produces a nice enough lather, but the rose smell is just not there.</li>
      <li>The scent is a lovely but masculine and unobtrusive Rose.</li>
      <li>(Read VERY economical)</li>
      <li>I consider this a very &amp;#34;forgiving&amp;#34; shaving cream, and always use it (or GFT Violet) when trying out a new blade or razor combination as it always gives great results.</li>
      <li>The Rose shaving cream is a deep pink in color, and has a strong (but pleasant) rose fragrance.  </li>
      <li>This, like all GFT products has a beautiful texture, thick and creamy, and doesn&#x27;t take much on a good brush to make a very very creamy lather.  </li>
      <li>Original Review:</li>
      <li>but i was quite impressed by how lather formed in my damp hands off a small size like this.</li>
      <li>, I get a clean, close shave, every time.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
      <li>however you will if you use a safety razor get the best shave of your life, save a ton of money, stop spending $35-40 dollars for a 10 pack of blades, and 20 blades for a safety razor will last a year this Trumpeter rose shave creme leaves a slight scent of roses and again my wife kept grabbing me sniffing me and kissing me and hell</li>
      <li>Trumpers is vastly superior even if the presentation of the product is similar.</li>
      <li>I have enjoyed it so much this was my go to gift for Christmas.</li>
      <li>this is SUPER STUFF......</li>
      <li>However, the fragrance more or less goes away once you wash after your shave, so you don&#x27;t end up smelling like a rose for the rest of the day.  </li>
      <li>It smells subtle and great, and it leaves your face feeling smooth and clean.</li>
      <li>Much gentler on the skin than traditional shaving cream, more pleasant smelling, and when you factor in how long it lasts, probably an economical choice as well.</li>
      <li>It lathers rich and easily, allowing the razor to glide effortlessly against my sensitive skin - minimizing irritation that I sometimes get - particularly on my neck.</li>
      <li>I think with these you are paying for an uncomfortable but WONDERFUL smelling shave.</li>
      <li>This is the 2nd shave cream I have tried (I still think the Limes version is my favorite).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different concoctions for shaving - soaps, creams, gels, oils, you name it.</li>
      <li>Smells exactly like roses.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;m trying a Geo F. Trumper shaving cream.  </li>
      <li>I will say that compared to others, it appears as though you need far less to make a great, three pass foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>;)  I think it would be nice to have a change every other day.</li>
      <li>I prefer vintage single edge injector razors and blades which I find are more intuitive to use and provide a better shave than any double edge razor, regardless of blade</li>
      <li>Just a tiny amount of the cream, applied with a good brush produces a thick lather that results in a very smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>The scent is nice and mild, and reminds me of the old barber shop where my mom took me to get haircuts when I was little.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It&#x27;s in line with all of trumpers products. It smells nice, but the performance is in line with van der hagen. I think with these you are paying for an uncomfortable but WONDERFUL smelling shave.</li>
    <li> this is SUPER STUFF......I think that it is working its way into the TOP TIER of my FAVORITES!</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap in error, thinking I was ordering the cake type that I have used for years. Surprised when the purchase arrived I thought, well might as well try it. What a difference. It is just great.  The big thing is that the lather lasts and lasts.  VERY happy with this product and intend to make it my regular shaving soap from now on.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried every premium shaving cream but in my experience this is the best stuff you can acquire. I&#x27;ve used Taylor&#x27;s of Old bond Street, Prorasso (the Red and Blue are nice), Nivea (pretty good for the price), Art of Shaving (an overrated, poor quality ripoff) and quite a few others. I&#x27;ve also tried shaving soaps that are often blabbered about on the sites like Badger and Blade. The shaving soaps were awful and created much irritation and a poor shave.  Geo. F. Trumper is often compared with TOBS. There is no comparison Trumpers is vastly superior even if the presentation of the product is similar. The great smooth, slick, voluminous lather, cushions and protects and provides the finest shaving I&#x27;ve experienced. The scent is a lovely but masculine and unobtrusive Rose. Which is another pleasure this shaving cream provides. My experience is an incredible irritation free shave, BBS shave. There is the coloring added. If you are sensitive to coloring use the Sandalwood which is very similar in performance.  Follow up with the Coral Skin Food, another fantastic Geo. F. Trumper product. Please throw away your multi-blade cartridge junk, you can&#x27;t get a decent shave with those toys and the Shaving Cream won&#x27;t help. In fact they work even worse with rich high quality shaving creams. I prefer vintage single edge injector razors and blades which I find are more intuitive to use and provide a better shave than any double edge razor, regardless of blade and I have a very large collection of double edge razors and blades that I have used so I have made comparisons to arrive at my opinion. Another great shaver is the vintage Gillette Techmatic, however you must understand the correct technique to obtain the best results. Purchase this shaving cream, a proper shaving system and the skin food and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very rich lather. I shave with a straight razor, and it gave me great lubercation, and no razor burn. I would recomend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Smells great, but it&#x27;s a little soft compared to other Trumper scents I&#x27;ve used. Violet is my favorite overall, and Extract of Limes is very good, too.</li>
    <li> This is not the original Geo F Trumper Rose. I have the same cream in the tube and compared them both. Different color and scent. Jar version is a deeper color with a soapy scent. I should have known there was something wrong when I paid more for the 75g tube than for the 200g jar. You get what you paid for. Buyer beware. I didn&#x27;t return it to avoid the hazle of dealing with post office.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different concoctions for shaving - soaps, creams, gels, oils, you name it. I am really impressed with this cream. It lathers quickly and well - just a few seconds of stirring with the badger brush, unlike many other creams and soaps. At first, the lather was a bit on the dry side, so I added a little water until I got the consistency I wanted. Just a little bit of this cream (like the size of a shelled pistachio or almond) is enough for a 2 or 3 pass shave, so I expect the tub will last a year or so. The lather is slick and doesn&#x27;t break down or slide off your skin. The scent is nice and mild, and reminds me of the old barber shop where my mom took me to get haircuts when I was little.</li>
    <li> My favorite, still using up other stuff this is going to be the only cream I use in the fututre</li>
    <li> The lather is good but it tends to cling a bit to the brush afterwards.  Hard to get clean. Don&#x27;t think I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I read about  Trumper shaving cream and I bought a jar.&lt;br /&gt;I can say that I love it, it smells good, not overpowering&lt;br /&gt;and it works great, I get a clean, close shave, every time.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, this jar will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good shaving cream, this is a good one,&lt;br /&gt; I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Update Jan 17, 2016:  After about 9 months, I have used up about three quarters of the jar.  At this rate, I expect it to last for a full year.  I find that I only need a tiny amount of the cream to generate a thick lather.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again.  Original Review: This is the first time I&#x27;m trying a Geo F. Trumper shaving cream.  Having used it now for a few weeks, I must say that it is as good as the TOBS shaving creams that I have used for several years.  The Rose shaving cream is a deep pink in color, and has a strong (but pleasant) rose fragrance.  Even the lather has a hint of pink.  However, the fragrance more or less goes away once you wash after your shave, so you don&#x27;t end up smelling like a rose for the rest of the day.  Just a tiny amount of the cream, applied with a good brush produces a thick lather that results in a very smooth shave.  At the rate I&#x27;m using this, I expect it to last for about 4 - 6 months of daily shaving. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this shaving cream again.</li>
    <li> the only thing wrong with it is that it will dye a sulvertip brush</li>
    <li> Lathers up easily with a rich foam, very smooth and creamy on the skin.  Designed for sensitive skin.  Rose scent is okay, not too overpowering, but I like the Violet cream better because it has more of a soap scent mixed in. Trumpers really produces a great product-- the lubrication for shaving is its best feature.</li>
    <li> Wow! What a shave. Lathers up nice. You only use a little of the product to develop a rich lather which gives a smooth shave. Great scent. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> wonderful shaving product and the scent is subtle but very nice</li>
    <li> I love this shaving cream. Best I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve used a bunch of them.</li>
    <li> I love it!! My wife loves the smell and creates beautiful lather. My skin feels so soft after. Great buy quality quality!</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite shaving cream since I got it as a gift when I was 13.  It smells subtle and great, and it leaves your face feeling smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> I love the cream. Wjips up a great lather for a smooth shave, i was worried about the rose scent, but it actually is very pleasent. The razor just glided down my face. If your new to DE shaving I ould suggest a high quality cream, and this is just the ticket!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried various shaving creams. This, by far, is the best for me. There&#x27;s not much detail one can go in to; it&#x27;s shaving cream. I will say that compared to others, it appears as though you need far less to make a great, three pass foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! It produces a great lather and the scent is very nice.Recommended!!</li>
    <li> I converted to wet shaving about 15 months ago, and the George F Trumper products had a lot of recommendations and reviews. This is the 2nd shave cream I have tried (I still think the Limes version is my favorite).  This, like all GFT products has a beautiful texture, thick and creamy, and doesn&#x27;t take much on a good brush to make a very very creamy lather.  It performs very well, either with my safety razor or my straight razor.  A tub like this will last you 6 months plus. For sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one star ding that I gave it was about the smell. The rose scent is very light, floral, fresh, but for me it is just not quite my style. I like the more citrus scents.  This is a solid 4 star, I&#x27;d say 4.5 if I could.</li>
    <li> This product produces a nice enough lather, but the rose smell is just not there. I prefer Taylor of Old Bond Street to this. Plus, the cream is a little harsh... probably because of the amount of dye that is in it. The Coral Skin Food is fantastic, though.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream I have ever used. I have enjoyed it so much this was my go to gift for Christmas.</li>
    <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream surprised me at first, as it has a fluffy sticky consistency (not a bar of soap like most other shaving soaps I have tried).  But, it lathers up really well, smells good, and makes for an exceptional shave.</li>
    <li> A great GFT shaving cream.  Scent is &amp;#34;rosy&amp;#34; without being too strong and it is great on my sensitive skin.  Many guys may be afraid of trying this one out because they think it might be too &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34;, but my wife loves when I shave with it and it is a nice change from some of my other creams.  And it works well on my sensitive skin.  I consider this a very &amp;#34;forgiving&amp;#34; shaving cream, and always use it (or GFT Violet) when trying out a new blade or razor combination as it always gives great results.</li>
    <li> This review may be unfair since I was also using a double edged razor, which I don&#x27;t usually shave with (normally a mach 3 guy), but this stuff came off in one pass and then left my skin dry and unprotected for additional passes.  I ended up having to put water on my face because it was so dry that I couldn&#x27;t run the razor over it a second time.  I much prefer Geo F. Trumper&#x27;s skin food to this product.  Try the lime scent.  The rose smell is very feminine, as well.  Not recommended.</li>
    <li> After trying sandalwood, avocado, sensitive, and some other formulations from the UK&#x27;s 3 T&#x27;s and some Proraso creams, I have to agree with others in regards to the quality of Trumper&#x27;s Rose shaving cream. I thought it an odd scent but ordered it after seeing such good reviews. It lathers rich and easily, allowing the razor to glide effortlessly against my sensitive skin - minimizing irritation that I sometimes get - particularly on my neck. The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming, so if you&#x27;re put off by smelling like a rose... don&#x27;t worry. The girlfriend loves it, but I think avocado is still her favorite cream of mine.</li>
    <li> Roses lots of roses and a great shave.</li>
    <li> While Trumpers SOAPS have many critics nowadays, due to reformulation that some consider detriments, that does hot apply to their shaving CREAMS -- which remain top-shelf products. I have enjoyed the Rose very much. Only a little amount is required to make plenty of slick and protective lather. Expensive, but will last a long time, so it is a reasonable price-per-shave. Scent in the container does not survive on the face, and I like that. Some guys prefer stronger scents, but not me. Highly recommended - one of Trumper&#x27;s best products.</li>
    <li> Use this for daily shaving (along with a badger brush), and get at least 3-4 months out of a tub.  Much gentler on the skin than traditional shaving cream, more pleasant smelling, and when you factor in how long it lasts, probably an economical choice as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service.</li>
    <li> great lather. 5.3 oz made for great buy</li>
    <li> Okay well not to sound like a cheeky bastard but this isnt rocket science, but it is one of the top five shabe cremes of all times if your one of those dumb bastards that buys this old fashioned shave creme then tries to use it with a MACH III modern razor then you deserve to be frustrated it will just clog the razor you must use a straight razor or a safety razor however you will if you use a safety razor get the best shave of your life, save a ton of money, stop spending $35-40 dollars for a 10 pack of blades, and 20 blades for a safety razor will last a year this Trumpeter rose shave creme leaves a slight scent of roses and again my wife kept grabbing me sniffing me and kissing me and hell thats ok, but on this one I found out quick not to put it on too thick, water it down and work it into a real lather then work it into your beard....awesome stuff! 5 stars</li>
    <li> scent is not natural like it used to be making it a bit of a turn off.</li>
    <li> Use it almost daily to shave.  Smells rosy when you apply it but doesn&#x27;t last beyond that.  Great lather and real good shave.  I use Harry&#x27;s razors.  Very nice</li>
    <li> This is a very girly smelling shave cream. It develops a lather easily, but the lather seems quite dry. I will not be making this part of my routine.</li>
    <li> I love this shaving cream.  The smell, lathering, and moisture is top notch. Almost a tie with Truefitt and Hill.  I would buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream is a little expensive.  But I think it is by far the best.</li>
    <li> excellent in all respects. Worth the extra money</li>
    <li> Smells exactly like roses. Not fruity or soft at all. Shave is smooth, razor glides across the skin with minimal friction. Have used it with Gillette Astra, Super Iridium, Blue bird, and Goal blades and a Edwin Jagger 89 razor</li>
    <li> I have heard other guys talking about the advantages of wet shaving...so i decided to start looking into it bit by bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a few shaving creams ...here&#x27;s my review of GFT&#x27;s Rose shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in a medium sized box ,i was impressed with GFT&#x27;s packaging ...as it is a well respected establishment in England.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- 1st thing i noticed was the neat plastic tub (which has a plastic sleeve inside) which the shaving cream came in. The smell of  flowery rose scent hit my nose upon opening the plastic sleeve. It looks like pink sugar paste....Wow...smells nice but a bit feminine.(so it might put off some of you) But as long as the better half didn&#x27;t mind...i didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2- One thing once i opened it i did ...was take a dab of it (almond sized) in my wet hands to see how it lathered. Whoa...like i said i&#x27;m a novice to this type of shaving but i was quite impressed by how lather formed in my damp hands off a small size like this. If anything it shows this is 200gm tub will last a few months if you shave every other day. (Ok i know ..i know..i need to use  a shaving brush plus bowl ...i&#x27;ll be reviewing those at a later time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 Once i lathered up my face, you felt a slight oil base coating your skin ...after a great 1st shave ...it felt like i had already put moisturizer on my face. It honestly felt great! No overwhelming smell ...a faint smell if anything. No complaints in any sense. if anything it left wanting to try out the other GFT shaving creams to see the difference in smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly can&#x27;t complain about using this product...i&#x27;d suggest you try a GFT shaving cream sampler...http://www.maggardrazors.com/product/geo-f-trumper-1-4-sample-pack-7-scents-shaving-cream/.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying this type of product  ...Try it...you&#x27;ll never look back afterwards.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream is amazing. I had heard about via a youtube video. Guys, if you shave with a double edge shaver I would highly recommend this cream. A tiny, tiny amount foams up to a luxurious lather and really goes a long way to prevent nicks and &amp;#34;weepers&amp;#34;. (Read VERY economical) Also, don&#x27;t be turned off by the rose scent. It is NOT a &amp;#34;Girly Man&amp;#34; smell at all. I really hate heavy perfume smells. The scent on this is very very light and a clean one at that. I am going to try the Trumpers Sandelwood next (The smell of &amp;#34;Old Spice&amp;#34;)  I think it would be nice to have a change every other day. I am an 60+ &amp;#34;old guy&amp;#34; who recently went back to DE shaving. I have been experimenting with shavers, blades and creams. This cream with my Mekur Future or old &#x27;59 vintage Gillette Fat Boy combined the Personna blades (Made in USA -Hooray!) gives me a better shave than my Mach 5 overpriced &amp;#34;toy&amp;#34; razor. Give it a try and think you will agree!</li>
